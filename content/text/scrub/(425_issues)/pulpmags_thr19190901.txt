the yacht was plowing through the
calm waters with a steady throb-
bing- of the engines the soft
washing of the waves along the sides
the murmur of the wind through the
light rigging aloft and the occasional
light footstep of the navigating officer
on the bridge were the only sounds

 the long white vessel swept on
through the night in silence here and
there a light showed from some port-
hole or window but for the mostv part
the whole boat was dark and silent
for once the yacht contained no merry
party of guests to one-step on the wide
decks and fill all the obscurer comers
with accurately paired couples

 alexander morrison millionaire

steamship magnate and his daughter
nita had the ship to themselves they
were sitting in two of the big wicker
chairs on the after deck and the glow
of morrisons cigar was the only
light

  getting chilly nita he remarked
casually are you wrm enough

  yes indeed nita was silent for
a moment gazing off into the darkness
its nice she said reflectively to be
by ones self for a while im glad
you didnt invite a lot of people to
come back with us

  her father smiled

  judging by the way you behaved
along the riviera he reminded her
you didnt mind company i never


the silver menace

saw any one quite so run after as you
were

  nita shook her head

  they were running after you
daddy she said lightly i was just
a means of approach

  her father puffed on his cigar for
a moment in silence

  it is a disadvantage having a mil-
lionaire for a father he admitted
its hard to tell who is in love with
you and who is in love with your
fathers money

  so the thing to do i suppose said
nita amusedly is just to fall in love
with some one yourself and pay no
attention to his motives

  where do you get your notions
asked her father thats cynicism
you havent been practicing on that
theory have you

   not i said nita with a little silvery
laugh but you know daddy it isnt
nice to feel like a money bag with a
lot of people looking at you all the time
some of them enviously and some of
them covetously but none of them re-
garding you just like a human being
i dont see declared her lather
with real affection how any normal
young man who looked at you could
stop thinking about you long enough to
think about your money

  i rise and bow said nita mis-
chievously may i return the compli-
ment substituting young woman for
young man  

  dont try to fool your father that
gentleman said with a smile he added
with something of conscious pride i
dont suppose there are two other men
in america as homely as i am
daddy protested nita laughing
youre lovely to look at i wouldnt
have you look a bit different for
worlds

  neither would i have myself look
different her father admitted cheer-
fully ive gotten used to myself this
way i like to look at myself this way

its an acquired taste like olives but
once you learn to like me this way-
why there you are

  nita laughed and was silent sud-
denly she began to look a little bit puz-
zled

  do you notice anything funny she
asked in a moment or so somehow
the boat doesnt seem to be traveling
just right

  her father listened only the usual
sounds came to his ears the washing
of the waves along the sides however
had a peculiar timbre then he noticed
that the boat seemed to be checking a
little in its speed there was an odd
velvety quality in the checking very
much like the soft breaking effect felt
when a motor boat runs into a patch
of weed

  queer said morrison well ask
the captain

  the two of them walked down the
deck arm in arm until they came to
the stair ladder leading up to the bridge
the gentle checking continued the
boat seemed to be gradually slowing
up though the engines throbbed on as
before

  whats the matter captain asked
morrison

  his first mate answered

  ive sent for the captain sir our
speedhas fallen off three knots in the
past five minutes

  the captain came hastily up on the
bridge buttoning up his coat as he
came

  whats the matter mr harrison
the first mate turned a worried face
to him

  our speed has dropped off three
knots in five minutes sir and seems
to be still slackening i thought it best
to send for you

  the captain called up the engine
room

  all right down there

  per-rhaps came the answer in a
thick scotch burr ah was aboot to
the silver menace



ask ye the same mysel were usin
twenty perr cent more steam for the
same number of revolutions

  we might have run into a big patch
of seaweed suggested the first mate

  unship the searchlight said the
captain crisply

  a seaman came up to the bridge he
had been sent back to look at the patent

log-

  were logging eight knots now sir
the first mate uttered an exclama-
tion

  thats six knots off what we were
making ten minutes ago

  no one spoke for a moment or so
while one or two seamen worked at
the lashing of the cover on the search-
light

  do any of you smell anything
asked nita suddenly

  a faint but distinct odor came to their
nostrils it was the odor of slime and
mud with a tinge of musk it was the
scent of foul things from the water
it was a damp and humid smell indis-
tinctly musklike and disgusting

  like deep-sea mud said one of
the seamen to the other like some-
thin come up from gawd knows what
soundin

  nita gasped a little the searchlight
sputtered and then a long white pencil
of light shot out over the water it
wavered and sank to a point just be-
side he bow of the boat it showed
-nothing

  the bow wave rose reluctantly and
traveled but a little distance before it
subsided into level sea there were
no waves the water was calm as an
inland lake

  no seaweed there said the captain
sharply look on the other side

  the searchlight swept across the deck
and to the water on the other side
nothing the water seemed to be tur-
gidly white but that was all it was
not clear it was rather muddy and al-
most milklike as if a little finely di-

vided chalk had been stirred in it
there was no disturbance of its placid
surface only the reluctant bow wave
surged away from the sharp prow of
the yacht

  the seaman returned from a second
trip to the patent log

  were logging five knots now sir

  nine knots off said the first mate
with a white face we were making
fourteen

  well take a look all around said
the captain sharply

  the searchlight obediently swept the
surface of the water every one on
the bridge followed its exploring beam
with anxious eyes that musky musty
smell of things from unthinkable depths
and the mysterious retardation of their
vessel filled them with apprehension

  there was not one of them from the
ignorant seamen to the supereducated
morrison who did not look fearfully
where the light beam went

  the hand laid on the vessel-that in
a calm sea had slowed from fourteen
knots to five despite the mighty engines
within the hull-that force seemed of
such malignant power that none of them
would have been greatly surprised to
see the huge bulk of some fabled kra-
ken rearing itself above the water pre-
paring to engulf the yacht with a sweep
of some colossal tentacle

  the sea was calm as far as the
searchlight could light up its surface
not a wave broke its calm placidity

  the seaman returned from his third
visit to the patent log

  two knots sir

  the movement of the yacht became
slower and slower as it gradually
checked in its sweep through the water
the throbbing of the engines grew
louder as they labored with increasing
effort to master the mysterious thing
that was holding them back

  the boat was barely creeping now
it seemed to be struggling against some
invisible force that gripped gently but


the silver menace

relentlessly some infinitely patient
force that from the very patience of its
operation was the more evidently in-
exorable

  the engines were working in panic-
stricken tempo now the chief engi-
neer had given them all the steam they
would take and the propellers thrashed
the water mightily but the ship slowed
slowed

  at last it was still while the engines
seemed to be trying to rack themselves
to pieces in their terrific attempt to
drive the ship against the thing that
held it back

  the captain watched with a set face
then ordered the engines reversed
there was an instants pause and the
propellers took up their thrashing of
the water again for a moment it
seemed that they would have some
effect the yacht shivered and moved
slightly backward but then stopped
again with the same soft gentleness

  the seamen inspected the water all
around the ship with lanterns lowered
to the waters edge they found noth-
ing a sounding line was thrown over-
board and sank for two hundred fath-
oms without reaching bottom

  the searchlight played endlessly
over the water trying to find some tur-
moil that might indicate the presence
f a monster whose tentacles had fas-
tened upon the ship but without result
the surface of the water was like glass

  again and again the engines strug-
gled mightily to move the ship again
and again the propellers beat the water
at the stem into froth and foam but
never did the yacht move by as much
as an inch

  the sea was calm and placid the
stars looked down from the moonless
sky and were reflected by the still sur-
face of the water

  the yacht struggled like a living thing
to break free from the mysterious force
that held her fast while all about her
acre hung that faintly disgusting odor

of slime from the depths of the sea
an indistinctly musky odor as of some-
thing unclean

  at last the wireless began to crackle
a frantic appeal for help giving the
details of what was happening on board
the yacht hardly had the message fin-
ished when the yacht began to rock
slightly as from a faint ground swell

ii

dut theodore old pet said davis
amiably the fact that a plane
wont loop the loop or make nose dives
at ninety degrees doesnt make it hope-
less as a battleplane

  he was affectionately expounding
the good points of a monster seaplane
drawn upn its hangar by the beach

  davis wore the insignia of a flight
commander of the aviation corps and
the ribbons of half a dozen orders be-
stowed on him after the destruction
of the black flyer destroyed by teddy
gerrod and himself some six months
before

  teddy gerrod was in civilian clothes
but was earnestly though cheerfully
disputing everything his friend said

  a two-seater like the one we used
six months ago he pointed out could
fly rings around this bs of yours and
with a decent shot at the machine gun
could smash it in no time

  fly rings around it not notice-
ably said davis confidently since
our idea of platinum plating the cyl-
inders everybodys doing it using
picro gasoline as you and i did we
get a hundred and eighty miles an hour
from this bus youre trying to dis-
parage and furthermore if you try
to damage this particular ship with
machine-gun bullets youre going to be
disappointed

 armor

  precisely i admit cheerfully that
you may know a lot about physics and
cold bombs and liquid gases and such
the silver menace



things but when it comes to flying ma-
chines-my dear chap you simply
arent there

  gerrod laughed

  perhaps not but id rather dance
around in a more lively fashion in a
little two-seater

  and privately admitted davis so
would i the next war we have im
going to arrange for you to be my
machine gunner

  delighted said gerrod but what
would evelyn say

  he was referring to his wife davis
waved his hand

  oh shed say there arent going to
be any more wars

  that reminds me said gerrod
we want you down for the next week-
end no other guests

  davis nodded abstractedly a mes-
senger was coming over to the hangar
at double time

  thanks hi be glad to come
wonder what this chap wants

  the messenger came up saluted and
handed davis a yellow slip davis tore
it open and read

   steam yacht mari posit a alexander mor-
rison of new york owner reports position
i iniow wants immediate assistance
engines and hull perfect condition not
aground no derelict or obstacle discoverable
unable tp move any direction sea calm
only possible explanation has been seized by
sea monster fit comm richard davis or-
dered to make reconnaissance of situation in
seaplane reported condition considered in-
credible but no naval vessels in immediate
vicinity fit comm richard davis will
make immediate investigation and report

  davis whistled

  heres something pretty he re-
marked take a look

  he handed the order to gerrod and
went quickly to the door leading into
the workshop attached to the hangar

  in a few crisp sentences he had or-
dered the big plane prepared for an
extended flight with provisions and as
much fuel as it would carry he re-
turned to find gerrod thinking busily

   may i come along on this trip

   its against regulations of course
said davis but no one will kick if
you go youre privileged

   he cried an order or so at the work-
men who were now swarming over
the machine

   although the wireless message had
been sent from the yacht after night-
fall the sun was barely setting on the
coast where the hangar was placed

   the vessel in distress was some thirty
degrees east of the coast and conse-
quently the sun set two hours before
it sank on the coastal line

  gerrod phoned a hasty message to
his wife and went to davis quarters
where he borrowed heavy flying clothes
from davis wardrobe the mechanics
and helpers worked with desperate
haste

   the aeroplane would be flying all
night long but it was desirable that it
take off while there was yet some light
the long fuel tank wras filled and the
motors run some ten or fifteen minutes
while critical ears listened for the faint-
est irregularity in their bellowing roar

   two engineers and a junior pilot were
to go with davis in the big aircraft and
they were hastily summoned and told
to prepare to leave in as short a time
as possible

   it was hardly more than half an hour
from the time the telegraphed order was
received before gerrod preceded davis
up the ladder and into the inclosed
cabin of the seaplane

  the motors were cranked-two men
tugging at the blade of each of the huge
propellers-and the plane slid slowly
down the ways and into the water

   davis maneuvered carefully until he
was clear of all possible entanglements
then he gave the motors more gas and
more their harsh bellow rose to a
deafening sound and the long boatlike
body began to surge through the wtaves
with gradually increasing speed

   for a few yards the spray blew upon


the silver menace

and spattered the glass windows of the
cabin then the planes began to exert
their lifting power and the plane began
to ride the waves instead of plowing
through them

  the speed increased again and sud-
denly the shocks of the waves beating
on its under surface ceased the plane
rode upon air with a smooth and vel-
vety motion that was sure and firm

  davis rose gradually to five thousand
feet and headed accurately to the east
a southerly wind reported by wireless
from a ship at sea would carry him
slightly to the south and the sum of
the two motions should bring him by
dawn very close to the spot from which
the yacht had sent out her wireless call

  davis was not pushing the plane to
its utmost he would need light by
which to descend and had no intention
of reaching the spot where the mari-
sposita was in distress until dawn

  from their altitude the ocean seemed
only a dark unfathomable mass below
them the stars twinkled down from
the arch of the sky in all their myriads
of sizes and tints

  there was no moon those in the
closed car of the big seaplane could
only see the star-strewn firmament
above them and upon all sides which
sank down and abruptly was not

  save for the cessation of the star
dusters the horizon was invisible the
sea was obscure and mysterious like
some mighty chasm over which they
flew precariously

  the dark wings of the plane stretched
out from the sides of the body with
a mighty sweep the plane was over
a hundred feet across and with the
powerful motors it possessed was capa-
ble of lifting an immense weight
even now more than two tons of fuel
were contained in the huge tanks in the
tail

  davis drove steadily on through the
night for a long time his face was
intent and keen he made little or no

attempt to look out of the windows be-
fore him

  his eyes were fixed almost continu-
ously upon the instruments before him
the altometer which was a barometer
graduated to read in feet and with
means for correcting the indication by
barometric readings from sea level the
inclinometer which showed the angle
at which the plane was traveling with
regard to the earths surface and the
compass

  the compass was one of the very
latest developments of the gyroscopic
compass and showed the true north
without regard for magnetic deviations

  davis felt out his machine thoroughly
and then turned it over to his junior
pilot the younger man-and to be
younger than davis meant that he was
very young indeed-slipped into the
drivers seat quickly ascertained the
course speed and altitude and settled
back to continue davis task while
davis curled himself up in a chair and
went instantly to sleep

  it was chilly in the car but davis
slept the sleep of the just ignoring the
roaring of the motors outside which
was only slightly muffled by the win-
dows of the car

  gerrod had gone to sleep some time
before and one of the two engineers
was similarly curled up on the floor of
the roomy and comfortable car

  hours passed while the big seaplane
winged its way steadily through the
night it roared its way across the
vast chasm of the dark ocean below
an incarnation of energy at which the
placid stars looked down in mild sur-
prise

  the exhausts roared continuously
the stays hummed musically and the
great wings cut through the air with
resistless force

  within the dark body of the plane
three men slept peacefully one sat up
sleepily listening to the motors and
prepared to wake into alertness at the
the silver menace



slightest sign of irregularity in the ac-
tion of any of them and one man sat
quietly at the controls his eyes fixed
on the instruments before him lighted
by tiny hooded electric bulbs

  course due east altitude five thou-
sand feet speed one hundred and fif-
teen miles twice during the night
davis woke and made sure that all was
well

  in leaving the navigation of the ma-
chine to his assistant he was not throw-
ing the major part of the work on him
the work would come in the morning
when they found the yacht

  if there were anything in the talk
of a sea monster having seized the
yacht davis would need to be fresh
for the search and possible battle that
would follow

  he was taking the most sensible pre-
caution possible and in any event
he had driven for the first four hours
during which the younger man had
rested

  the first gray light began to appear
in the east the pilot of the plane
had not looked away from his instru-
ments for an hour and not until a faint
light outside called his attention to the
approach of dawn did he think to glance
through the windows

  a dimly white glow was showing as
an irregular splotch toward the east
the pilot saw it and noticed something
odd about its appearance but did not
stop to examine it closely

  he called davis as he had been or-
dered to do davis sat up rubbed his
eyes and was thoroughly awake

  all right  he asked

  the pilot nodded

  sunrise he said you said to call
you

  right you are davis stood up and
stretched his muscles here teddy
wake up

  gerrod stirred and in a moment was
awake davis deftly prepared coffee
and sandwiches

  rescuers like ourselves need to be
fed he observed with a smile i
wonder what is actually the matter with
that person morrison

  millionaires are timid folk gerrod
agreed ill bet weve had a wild-
goose chase

  funny though said davis rumi-
natively people dont usually send
out wild wireless messages like that
they probably ran into a big bunch
of seaweed

  he bit into a sandwich the two en-
gineers with completedemocracy were
already eating the man at the con-
trols suddenly uttered an exclamation

  whats the matter asked davis
quickly

  look out the window said the pilot
in a tone indicating that he could not
believe his eyes

  davis looked and his mouth dropped
partly open before them the white
patch of light had turned golden and
then yellow a bank of clouds lay
before them behind which the sun was
evidently hidden

  that had not caused davis exclama-
tion however he was not amazed at
anything he saw but at the lack of
something he did not see-the ocean
the cloud bank was illuminated by the
sun it covered half of the sky before
them and below them

  there was no ocean below them
there was no land below them above
the rapidly graying sky could be seen
below them was rapidly graying sky
there was no horizon there was no
land there was no sea

  there was only sky they seemed
to be alone in an illimitable firmament
a derelict in open space adrift in some
unthinkable ether in which there was
no landing space or any solid thing ex-
cept themselves

  above them and below them before
them and behind them on their right
side and their left side was sky and
nothing but sky there was not one
io

the silver menace

bit of solid matter visible on either side
ahead or behind up or down

  it was as if they had gone aloft and
while they flew the earth had been de-
stroyed only the incredibility of such
a catastrophe kept them from believing
it instantly

  teddy said davis in a moment or
two trying to jest though his voice
was shaking youre our tame scientist
whats happened to our well-beloved
earth  has it gone off and left us in
the lurch  have we flown off into
space 

  gerrod was looking with all his eyes
he looked down into a blue bowl that
was the exact counterpart of the dome

above

  which way is down he asked
quietly is it that way or that way
he pointed over his head and at his
feet are we flying right side up or
upside down or what

  the plane banked sharply and side-
slipped for a moment before it recov-
ered

  steady said davis to the man at
the controls steady-

the machine banked again then shot
upward stalled and slipped on again

   straighten out  said davis sharply
up with the joy stick

  i dont know whats what said
the white-faced pilot desperately obey-
ing as he spoke great god  whats
happening now 

  the plane seemed to be standing on
its tail and the three men standing in
in the car slid toward the rear davis
seized a seat and clambered toward the
controls as he made his way toward
the instruments the plane seemed to go
mad

  it twisted turned stood upon its
head and darted forward and then
seemed to be wallowing in the air
davis seized the controls and with his
eye solely on the inclinometer worked
madly for a moment the plane stopped
its antics and drove on steadily

  its like driving in a fog he said
over his shoulder all right back
there now 

 yes gerrod was answering
what happened 

  with nothing to tell which was up
and which down we lost our level and
couldnt find it again tve flown upside
down for five minutes going through
a cloud and didnt know it until my
barometer dropped upward were all
right but whats happened to the
earth 

  gerrod cautiously made his way to
a point beside davis who was driving
with his eyes glued to the instruments
that incredible vastness into which the
machine seemed to be boring was ap-
palling they seemed to be speeding
madly from nothingness into nothing-
ness with nothing below them and
nothing above

  they were alone in a universe of air
gerrod stared ahead at the cloud bank
behind which the sun seemed to be
hiding

  theres the sun all right whats
out barometer reading

  eight thousand feet

  trv dipping bv the inclinometer
da vis did so though there was not
the slightest change in the appearance
of the sky that compassed them all
about the barometer quivered from
eight thousand feet to seven and then
to six gerrod suddenly uttered an ex-
clamation 

  the suns coming out

  the fiery disk of the sun peered
slowly from behind the edge of the
cloud bank

  theres another

  from the opposite side of the cloud
bank a second sun could be seen slowly
appearing as had the first the two
suns swam away from the fringe of
the cloud and glared at each other

  ive got it gerrod struck his knee
w ith his hand what fools we are 
im glad were only fools said
the silver menace



davis mildly ive been afraid we had
gone mad whats happened 

  why the water gerrod said ex-
citedly the water is perfectly calm
and reflects like a mirror we dont
see the sky below us we see the re-
flection of the sky and that isnt a
second sun he pointed thats the re-
flection of the sun

  only the water doesnt reflect like
that said davis at least not from
straight overhead open a side window
and look directly downward

  gerrod did so and exclaimed again
im right i tell you directly un-
der us i can see the reflection of our
plane flying upside down

  davis took a quick glance

  i guess you are right after all he
admitted but the water doesnt re-
flect like that normally something
queer must have happened he was
silent a moment while his eyes swept
the distance before them keenly
heres another proof youre right
theres the yacht were looking for
far away its white hull turned to red
gold by the first rays of the sun they
saw the yacht motionless on the water
and in striking corroboration of ger-
rods hypothesis they saw every line
and every spar reflected in the water
below

  davis shifted his course to bear for
the yacht and dipped down until he was
only five hundred feet above the
strange mirrorlike surface of the sea
below them they could see the spread-
ing wings of their seaplane reflected
from the still water

 they swept up to the yacht and
circled above it the junior pilot un-
shipped the tiny wireless set of the aero-
plane and it crackled busily for a few
moments

all right to alight he reported
they say nothing has happened all
night but theyre still unable to move
the plane swept around the yacht in
a wide circle coming lower and lower

it was quite impossible to judge where
the surface of the water might be but
davis kept his eye on the deck of the
yacht to get the level from that

  at last he made his decision being
quite unable to tell exactly where the
surface was he could not land in the
usual fashion he slowed in mid-air
until the machine was moving at the
lowest speed at which it would keep
aloft

  then by a jerk of the joy stick he
headed it upward at an angle it was
unable to make at that speed the re-
sult was that the machine stalled pre-
cisely like a motor car on an upgrade
and with next to no headway pan-
caked sank vertically-downward

  sit tight he ordered as the plane
sank

  next moment every one of them
clutched wildly at the nearest object
to keep himself from falling the
plane had struck the surface but in-
stead of skimming forward as its slight
remaining headway made it try to do
it was brought to a sudden standstill
as if by a mighty brake

  only a miracle kept it from overturn-
ing davis opened a window of the
cabin and shouted

  throw us a rope and haul us along-
side

  the men on the deck of the yacht
heard him and a rope came hurtling
through the air to fall across one of
the wings davis scrambled out and
made it fast those on the yacht
hauled but the plane did not move
half a dozen men grasped the slender
line and threw their united weight upon
it the rope broke with a snap

  what the- exclaimed davis in

astonishment

  a second rope was thrown the cap-
tain of the yacht called from the bridge

  haul a heavy line to you and make
that fast

  wondering those on the seaplane
obeyed the sailors on the yacht made


the silver menace

the other end of the stouter line fast
to a capstan and manned it slowly
and reluctantly the seaplane was drawn
toward the white vessel

  it was gerrod who looked behind
them where the float of the seaplane
had been he saw a deep depression in
the surface of the water which as he
watched slowlv filled

  the sea is turned to jelly he ex
claimed and he was right

  they found the truth of the matter
when they clambered on board the
yacht with the morning the members
of the crew were able to make a
more thorough investigation of what
had happened

  they lowered boats and the boats
stuck fast when oars were dipped
into the strangely whitened or silvered
water the oars were drawn out coated
with a sticky silvery mass of a jellylike
substance

  from the deck of the yacht the al-
tered appearance of the sea was as re-
markable as from the air all of the
ocean seemed to have been changed to
a semisolid mass of silver

  the horizon had vanished or ended
into the sky imperceptibly so it could
not be distinguished the captain dis-
cussed the matter with them

  ive never seen anything like this
before he said perplexedly ive
been on a ship that traveled two hun-
dred miles on a milk sea but never
anything like this

  what do you think it is asked
davis something on the order of
a milk sea

  the captain nodded

  you know a milk sea is caused by
a multitude of little animals that color
the water milky white theyre phos-
phorescent at night this must be
something on that order only these
cluster together until the water is made
into a jelly and they have a queer
slimy smell

  they arent phosphorescent said
davis

  no of course not

  nita morrison had joined the little
group her father was beside her
looking rather worried

  well said nita anxiously whats
to be done how are we going to get
the yacht free

  im afraid we arent said davis
smiling the telegraphed orders that
brought me here told me simply to make
an examination and make a report my
plane cant do anything for the yacht
of course

 then what-

  ill go back and report davis ex-
plained and theyll send boats to try
to get in to you people there doesnt
seem to be any immediate danger and
at worst you can all be taken off by
aeroplane if we can rise again from
that jelly mess

  nita wrinkled her small nose

  i know we arent in danger she
said or at least i know it now but
are we going to have to stay here and
smell that horrid smell until the gov-
ernment gets ready to rescue us

  the odor of the jellylike animalcules
was far from pleasant it was an un-
clean scent as of slime dredged from
the bottom of the sea

  well- said davis thoughtfully i
dare say we can accommodate two more
people it isnt quite regular but thats
a detail

  but the crew morrison looked
inquiringly at the captain of the yacht

  milk seas always break up sir said
the captain i have no doubt this sil-
ver sea will break up as well we can
wait and see and at worst we have
our wireless

  then its settled said nita joy-
fully from sheer gratitude she smiled
at davis

  always providing we can get aloft
again said davis

  the propellers of the ship sir sug-
the silver menace



gested the captain though they cant
move the yacht yet manage to thrash
a fair-sized patch of this jelly into
liquid

  a good idea said davis heartily
well haul the plane around to the
stern and youll set your engines run-
ning

  in a very little time this was done
the great propellers of the yacht
thrashed mightily and a narrow patch
of open water opened in the silver sea
the seaplane was laboriously hauled
around to the stern of the yacht and the
party was lowered on board

  with some difficulty the motors were
cranked again and the plane scuttled
madly down the lane of water with
a quick jerk of the joy stick davis
lifted the plane from the water just
as the open water ended and the silver
sea began

  the big plane circled in the air ris-
ing steadily as it circled and at last
headed for the west again still flying
in that incredible appearance of sky
above and sky below with the reflected
sun glaring upward just as fiercely as
the real sun beat down

iii

ktita sat in the seat beside davis
control chair pointing to the in-
struments one by one

  and thats the inclinometer she
repeated to tell you the angle at which
the plane is climbing or descending
thats the barometer which reads-let
me see-seventy-four hundred feet
were over a mile high arent we

  we are said davis though by
the looks of things we are ten thousand
miles from anywhere

  the silver sea was still beneath them
and they still seemed to be floating in
a universe of air nita paid no atten-
tion

  and thats the compass dial and
that- what did you call it

  an anenometer said davis again
smiling its the speedometer of the
air-or the patent log whichever you
like to call it

  you only have to learn one syllable
said nita they all end in ometer
its convenient that theyre named like
that

  davis smiled

  i never thought of jhat before but
it is convenient

  but how do you balance the plane
nita demanded

  in straightaway flight it balances it-
self davis explained its one of the
new inherently stable designs for
turning the wing tips work automati-
cally weve a gyroscopic affair that
attends to them

  nita subsided for a moment then
demanded further information

  whats that lever for to change
speeds 

  davis laughed

  well no we havent but one speed

forward and no reverse-

  youre making fun of me

  thats the joy stick said davis
chuckling we dive and climb with
it pull it back and we go up push
it forward and we dive

  mmmmm said nita interestedly
her father took his cigar out of his
mouth long enough to join in davis
chuckle at nitas absorbed air

  dont talk to the motorman nita
he said he may run past a switch
nita turned around and smiled at
him the car was rather crowded with
seven people in it gerrod was look-
ing curiously at a bit of the silvery jelly
with which he had filled several pails
before leaving the yacht he took a
bit of it between his thumb and fore-
finger and rolled it back and forth spec-
ulatively

  it seemed faintly granular to the
touch but at the slightest pressure un-
derwent a change that felt like cruiti-


the silver menace

bling and was nothing but watery
liquid

  til bet anything you care to name
he said thoughtfully that this is just
a mass of little animalcules with little
silvery shells the silver shells would
account for the reflection we see
the captain of my yacht observed
morrison said that he thought it was
like a milk sea thats a mass of little
animals that glow like phosphorus in
the dark

  perhaps said gerrod meditatively
id like to look at this stuff under
a microscope

  oh some of it will go to the gov-
ernment chemists said morrison with
a large air and theyll figure out a
way to kill the little beasts theres
a cure for everything

  perhaps said gerrod

  the plane flew on steadily davis
finding some amusement in gratifying
nitas suddenly aroused curiosity
about every part of the seaplane when
her curiosity about the plane was sat-
isfied however and she began to make
inquiries about himself davis was
much less comfortable

  he tried to be evasive but she pinned
him down and was filled with excite-
ment when she found that he was the
same man who as lieutenant davis
had flown the two-seated flying machine
that had destroyed the black flyer and
with it varrhus menace to the liberty
of the world

  she tried very hard indeed to get
him to tell her the story of that fight
but he blushed and said there was noth-
ing to tell it would be hard to say to
what lengths she would have gone had
not something outside the plane caught
her attention

  theres the horizon she ex-
claimed weve come to the edge of
the silver sea and from here on its
just the plain good old-fashioned
ocean

  the line that marked the point where

sea and sky joined was indeed visible
and a gradually widening bank of
darker blue showed that the silver sea
had indeed come to an end

  as the seaplane flew onward the
darker wave-tossed ocean came toward
them and passed below but blended
so gradually with the jellied ocean that
it was impossible to tell where the sil-
ver sea ended and blue water began
it was evident that the silver sea was
still growing

  then for a long time the seaplane
sped onward over the blue waters while
nita tried ingeniously to extract from
davis the details of the fight with the
black flyer

  davis was acutely uncomfortable
but nevertheless he felt strangely dis-
appointed when the dim line of the
coast appeared ahead he hovered a
moment to get his bearings and then
sped northward toward the aviation
station to which he was attached

  nita too seemed disappointed she
had enjoyed tormenting davis and he
impressed her very favorably after
the plane had swooped downward and
come to rest on the water a scant two
hundred yards from the hangar in
which it was kept she turned to davis

  well she announced since i
havent been able to make you tell me
what i want to know this time i warn
you i shall make you tell me next time

  davis smiled

  may i hope there will be a next
time

  nita smiled at him

  i shall be angry if there isnt she
said demurely

  the launch came up to tow them
ashore and davis was busy for a few
moments but before nita and her
father climbed into the motor car they
had commandeered to take them to the
city he found time to make a more
definite arrangement and learned he
was expected to call at the morrison
mansion very very soon
the silver menace

t

  the description of the silver sea
aroused but little attention in the news-
papers a particularly pathetic mur-
der trial was filling the public mind
and small paragraphs in obscure cor-
ners describing the plight of the yacht
contained all that the public learned

  every one seemed to dismiss the mat-
ter as a natural curiosity which would
probably disappear in a little while an
aggregation of tiny animalcules which
had clustered together until they formed
a jellylike mass did not promise much
in the way of drama and our news-
papers are essentially purveyors of
drama

  obscure notices in the shipping news
however told of the growth of the sil-
very patch and at last there was a rip-
ple of interest caused by the news that
the crew of the yacht claimed that the
jellylike creatures were clambering up
the sides of the ship and threatening to
overwhelm the vessel

  seaplanes put out from shore and
took the crew off and then public in-
terest lapsed again an almost un-
eventful accident to the yacht of a
steamship magnate was good material
for society news but not for the pages
devoted to items of general interest

  to davis however anything pertain-
ing to nita had become of surpassing
interest he practically haunted her
house and nita seemed not at all un-
willing to have him there her father
was as cordial as nita at first but later
began to watch davis frequent appear-
ances with something of disquiet

  davis was sufficiently well known
from his black flyer episode to be con-
sidered socially eligible anywhere but
he was far from rich he had consist-
ently refused the numerous offers from
motion-picture companies and book
publishers to enact or relate his exploits
though the acceptance of any of those
offers would have meant a small for-
tune

  davis was instinctively unwilling to

commercialize his reputation morri-
son could find no fault with him per-
sonally but he could not quite believe
that davis increasingly evident infat-
uation for nita was real-that he was
actually more than a fortune hunter

  the shipping news continued to give
sparsely phrased notice of the location
and size of the silver sea two naval
vessels were assigned to observe it re-
porting regularly to the meteorological
bureau

  it must be recorded to the credit of
that much-maligned department of
weather forecasts and maritime infor-
mation that it was probably the first
body to see the possibilities of evil that
lay in the silver sea

  it had quantities of the silvery mass
of animalcules brought to it for study
and set its scientists to work to try
and find a means of destroying them
fish would not eat them they seemed
to possess some repulsive taste that led
all the carnivorous fishes to avoid them
at all costs placed in an aquarium
with a huge sea bass that was excep-
tional for its voracity the sea bass
avoided the tiny jellylike mass as it
would the plague

  the silver globule of jelly multiplied
in size and still the sea bass avoided
it retreating to the farthest corners of
its tank to keep from coming in con-
tact with the little animalcules at last
the aquarium was ashimmering mass
of silvery sticky jelly and the bass
was unable to retreat farther it was
found gasping out its life outside the
tank having leaped from the water to
escape from the omnipresent silver
menace

  the silver sea grew in size it be-
gan to figure in the news again when
passengers on the transatlantic liners
noticed that the steamers were taking
a route much farther to the north than
was customary it was admitted at the
steamship offices that the detour was
i

the silver menace

made for the purpose of avoiding the
now vast silver sea

  late in march people along the east-
ern coast of the united states began
to remark upon a musklike slimy smell
that was faintly discernible in the sea
breeze a steamer going from new
york to bermuda reported seeing a
patch of the silvery jelly only three
hundred miles from the eastern coast
the disagreeable musklike smell was
strong and noticeable

  the newspapers woke to the possi-
bilities of the silver sea ships could
not navigate in its jellied waters nor
fish swim it covered thousands of
square miles now and was growing
with an ominous steadiness that fore-
boded ill

  the seaside resorts along the atlan-
tic coast were practically abandoned
tourists would not stay where that
foul slimy musklike scent was borne
to them constantly on the sea breeze
the patches that were the forerunners
of the silver sea itself appeared along
the coast at last the horizon disap-
peared

  the silver sea had come close indeed
to the shore then every newspaper
burst into huge headlines for the dif-
ferent papers they were phrased differ-
ently but the burden of each displayed
in the largest possible type was

coastal navigation stopped

americas communication with the world
   cut off by silver sea-harbor blocked
   from maine to georgia-authorities
   helpless to fight silver menace

  then the world began to be afraid

iv

fvwts was unwontedly silent as ger-
rod drove him out to the tiny cot-
tage to which he had been invited

  evelyns expecting you said ger-
rod as the little motor car wound up
a hill between banks of fragrant trees

that line the road on either side we
rather looked for you last week but
you wired you know

  yes i know said davis gloomily
i went somewhere else

  gerrod smiled davis was sufficiently
his friend to break an engagement and
admit it frankly and besides gerrod
more than suspected where davis had
gone

  how is miss morrison  he asked

  shes all right said davis still more
gloomily but damn her father

  gerrod raised his eyebrows and said
nothing until they arrived at the cot-
tage with the little built-on laboratory
evelyn came out at the sound of the
motor and shook hands with davis

  we were beginning to be afraid the
competition was too much for us she
said with a smile

  davis looked at her and tried to smile
in return but the result was a dismal
failure

  oh im glad to be here now he
said dolefully

  gerrod made a sign to evelyn not
to refer to nita again until he could
speak to her and helped davis cariy
his two suit cases into the house

  your usual room of course he
said cheerfully dinner is served at
the same hour as before and you can
do just as you please until you fed
like coming down ill be in the labor-
atorv

  darvis went heavily upstairs his usu-
ally cheerful face suffused with gloom
evelyn glanced at gerrod

  whats the matter she asked
quickly has he quarreled with nita

  gerrod shook his head smiling

  i asked about her and he answered
by damning her father i suspect he
has run against a little paternal oppo-
sition

  evelyns eyes twinkled and she
laughed

  best thing in the world for them
the silver menace



she declared wtien hes ripe for it
ill take a hand- nita morrison was
a classmate of mine in college and i
know her well enough to help along

  gerrod chuckled

  he was like a funeral all the way
out well let him alone until he wants
to talk and then you can advise him
all you like but just now i want to
get back at those small animals that are
raising so much particular cain

  he went into the laboratory and
slipped off his coat he had a number
of test tubes full of the silvery animal-
cules and was examining them under
all sorts of test conditions to determine
their rate of growth and multiplication

  he was rather hopeful that he would
be able to demonstrate that after a cer-
tain period they would-because of
their extremely close packing together
-either die from inability to obtain
nourishment or be poisoned from their
own secretions

  he was looking curiously at a phe-
nomenon that always puzzled him when
davis came into the room his ex-
pression was that of a man utterly with-
out hope

  whatve you got there he asked
listlessly

  some of our silvery-little pets said
gerrod cheerfully im studying them
in their native lair have you looked
at them under a microscope 

  no

  gerrod smeared a bit of the silvery
mess on a glass slide and put it under
a microscope he worked busily for
a moment or so adjusting the focus
and then waved davis toward the eye-
piece

  theyre funny little beasts look
them over

  davis looked uninterestedly but in
a moment even his gloom was lightened
by the interest of the sight he saw
the enlargement of the microscope was
so great that only a few of the tiny
zathrill

animals were visible but each of them
was clearly and brilliantly outlined

  they were little jellylike creatures
roughly spherical in shape with their
bodies protected by almost infinitely
thin silicious shells that possessed a
silvery luster from dozens of holes
in the fragile shells protruded fat jelly-
like tentacles that waved and moved
restlessly forever in search of food

  under the microscope the shells were
partly transparent and within the jelly-
like body inside the shell could be seen
a single dark spot

  that blotch in their shells seems to
be the nucleus or else their stomach
i cant quite make out if theyre one-
celled animals like amcebae or if theyre
really complex creatures

  rum little beggats said davis
without removing his gaze from the
eyepiece theyre separate animals
anyway odd that they should make
a jelly like mass

  move the slide about a little sug-
gested gerrod youll see how they
do that youre looking at individuals
now sometimes-and i think its
when food gets scarce-they twine their
tentacles together and the tentacles ac-
tually seem to join as if they were
welded into one in fact as far as
nourishment goes they do seem to be-
come a single organism thats when
they ye so noticeably jellylike

  davis watched them curiously for a
few moments and then straightened up
he moved restlessly about the room

  the funny thing said gerrod
cheerfully ignoring davis evident
gloom is that they seem to be able
to move about see this test tube
theyve climbed up the sides of the
glass until they almost reach the top
i know said davis uninterestedly
when we took the crew off that yacht
they showed us where the jellylike mass
seemed to be slowly creeping up the
sides of the ship looked like exag-
gerated capillar action


the silver menace

  gerrod listened with a thoughtful
frown

  i wonder- he began but davis

turned to him suddenly

  look here teddy tm in a mess
i want your advice

  gerrod put down his test tubes and
sat on one of the tables in the labora-
tory swinging his legs and preparing
to be properly sympathetic with davis
plight which he already knew perfectly
well

  go ahead

   its like this said davis reluctantly
 liked nita tremendously the first
time i saw her and she seemed to like
me too i called on her and she
seemed to like me better and i kept
on calling i must have pretty well in-
fested her house but she didnt seem

to mind it you know-

  gerrod nodded sympathetically

  i know

  well said davis savagely i found
out i was pretty badly gone on her
and last week i was just getting up
the nerve to propose-and i know she
wouldnt have been displeased-when
that infernal father of hers began to
inter fere

  he asked you quite pleasantly said
gerrod with a faint smile exactly why
it was that you were coming around
so often

  and i told him said davis sud-
denly plunged into gloom again it
was rather premature because i hadnt
talked to nita but i told her father
i wanted to marry her and i loved
her and all that

  and her father suggested gerrod
asked what your prospects were and
the rest of it it takes a millionaire
to be really middle class

  thats what he did admitted davis
miserably i told him my pay
amounted to something and i had about
two or three thousand a year income
from stocks and bonds and such things
and he laughed at me told me how

much nita cost him damn it i dont
care about how much nita pays for

dresses

  we men are deuced impractical
said gerrod with a smile but what
was her fathers next move

  oh-davis looked as if he could
weep-he was polite and all that and
said how much he liked me and such
rot then he asked me not to see nita
again until i was in a position to offer
her the things she had been raised to
expect you see the idea he put it
that he didnt want nita to learn to
care for me unless it were possible for
me to make her happy and so on it
made me sick

  i know gerrod nodded again
he practically put you on honor to
preserve nitas happiness at the cost
of your own

damn him yes davis clenched
his fists but nita does care some-
thing about me i know she does
gerrod watched davis with eyes
from which he had banished every trace
of a twinkle until davis had calmed
down a little then he said cheerfully
lets go ask evelyn about it his
late majesty king solomon once re-
marked that women should have the
wisdom of the serpent among other
qualifications well see if evelyn
comes up to solomons specifications
he led the morose davis out of the
room

  the great american public became
alarmed and rather resentful when its
harbors were blocked by the silvery
jelly it felt though that the silver
menace was more of an imposition on
the part of mother nature than anything
else

  passenger traffic with europe could
be maintained by air and freight could
probably be routed through the far
northern seas to which the silver
menace had not yet penetrated the
public considered it an annoyance and
the silver menace



those who were accustomed to go to
the seashore for their vacations were
disgusted that the mountains would re-
ceive them that summer

  they were quite sure they did not
want to go down where that slimy
disgusting musklike odor from the
stilly silent silver sea would make their
days unpleasant and the nights unen-
durable fresh fish too became almost
prohibitive in price as the fishing fleets
were immured in the harbors that had
now become mirrorlike masses of the
disgusting jelly

  the public resented those things but
was not really afraid it was not until
nearly a week after the closing of the
harbors had passed that the world was
informed of the silver menaces real
threat to the human race and began
to feel little shivers of horror-stricken
apprehension when it looked at the
morning papers

  the news was at first passed about
in swift furtive rumors but half be-
lieved as something too horrible to be
credited the rumors grew however
and became more circumstantial but
the newspapers remained silent

  it is known now that the government
had ordered that no hint of the new
danger be allowed to become public
while its scientists worked night and

dav to discover a means of combating
th is silent relentiess threat that men-
aced our whole existence whispers
flew about and became magnified but
the facts themselves could not be mag-
nified

  at last the government could keep
silence no longer and the world was
informed of the true malignity of the
silver menace the silvery jelly had
reached the american coasts invaded
and conquered the harbors and was
even then rapidly solidifying the rivers
but its threat did not end there

  tust as it had crept up the sides of
gerrods test tubes and as it had over-
whelmed the yacht now it crept up the
beaches slowly and inexorably the
slimy masses of jelly crept above the
water line the beaches were buried
below thick blankets of sticky shim-
mering animalcules and still the men-
ace grew

  they overwhelmed all obstacles
placed in their path the whole green
fertile earth was threatened with burial
beneath a mantle of slimy silvery glis-
tening horror

the pick-up

by charlotte mish

she was standing on the comer watching the passers-by wistfully she
shivered a little in the chill breeze that was blowing around the corner
as i came nearer and her gaze fell upon me her brown eyes seemed to
plead with me i hesitated for a moment-and passed on when i reached
the next comer i turned i saw her still standing in the same place and i
retraced my steps until i stood close beside her again i noticed that she was
very thin and her eyes looked hungry she shivered again pitifully and her eyes
smiled a wan invitation

     well i took her to a restaurant and got her something to eat she ate
ravenously probably her first good meal for days

     then i called a cab and we climbed inside as she sat beside me on the
seat i cautiously put my arm around her she did not resist but snuggled closer
i took her home

     yes she is an airedale and will make an excellent watchdog

chapter i

the breath of adventure

to begin it is well to tell you that
the adventure opened in san
francisco on the day that i met
chilling manners at the golf club

  i had known manners for all of ten
years-since i was a harum-scarum lad
of twenty-but i never had known
much about him except that he always
had plenty of money and at the times
when he appeared in frisco as if he
had been dropped from the clouds
mingled freely with the best social cir-
cles

  about thirty-five a six-footer fat
jolly educated cultured elegant
widely-traveled-a most agreeable com-
panion was manners a mystery
though he always had been to me

  even his name suggested mystery i
suspected that it was assumed but for
no tangible reason except that it fitted
him so illy he had anything but chill-
ing manners in fact there was a no
more warm-hearted warm-blooded ap-
proachable fellow of my acquaintance

  manners had a habit however that

had puzzled me on more than one occa-
sion it was a habit of disappearing
to-day one would be chatting pleas-
antly with the fellow over a highball
and to-morrow le would be gone-
none of his acquaintances knew where

  three months maybe six months
later he would drop in on us as casually
as though he had left us only on the
day before

  the day to which i referred in the
beginning came after one of manners
usual disappearances as i said i was
at the golf club sitting on the broad
veranda hating myself and the world in
general and giving desultory attention
to both the blue heaving pacific and
to a game in progress on the links

  hello farnworth greeted a cheer-
ful voice at my elbow

  not recognizing the voice and fear-
ing another club bore i was not keen
to respond my feelings changed
though when i glanced up and saw
manners there he was smiling fas-
tidiously groomed looking not a day
older than when i had seen him last

  hello yourself i said casually

  i knew manners well enough not to

make a fuss over him though i confess
i was glad to see him i arose and ex-
tended my hand which he -clasped
eagerly

  quite as well as i look he returned
easily and you

  splendid sit down and have some-
thing 

  thanks manners dropped into a
chair tteside mine while i motioned to
a waiter rwe were talking about your
try at the thousand-yard butts he
added when thompson broke in with
that rave about his new motor how
did you make out 

  i looked at the man in amazement
and it took me several seconds to get
the drift of his conversation he was
taking up a talk that we had had five
months before just where we had been
interrupted he had remembered
while i having nothing to do but to
lounge about and laze my time away
had all but forgotten

oh i said i won the trophy
good wish i could shoot like you
practice i said laconically i was
just vain enough to be pleased by his
commendation because marksmanship
was my pet hobby

  i havent the patience even if i had
the eye replied manners how are
you with a pistol

  rather good i boasted smugly
only yesterday i split a penny at
thirty paces

  some shooting that he lauded
ever get you anything

  only a few tin cups and brass
medals and the satisfaction of shooting
a little straighter than the other fellow
we entered then into a casual con-
versation finally after i told him that
i was somewhat bored by the life i was
leading he asked if i would like to
join the mystery club

  the mystery club i repeated
what pray is the mystery club
come and find out he replied
were having a dinner to-night at the

renaissance and i should be glad to
have you of course you wont be ex-
pected to scuttle a ship or rob a train
right away manners paused and
laughed sincerely-one of his old-time
well modulated outbursts and you
will have the compensation of a good
dinner in the company of a bunch of
real men

  i was sure now that manners had
been having a bit of fun at my expense
and the thought caused me a flash of
anger well i decided to make him
pay for it i would take him at his
word and let him stand the cost of
dinner

  and it wouldnt be a cheap dinner
either at the renaissance one of the
newest and most expensive cafes m the
city besides i was sure that i would
be quite safe there whether dining with
the mystery qub or a delegation from
the mothers union

  youre on i said simply

  you mean that you will join
there was a note of eagerness in his
voice that was not lost on me

  i mean that ill have dinner with
you i hedged

  good he slapped me jovially on
the back youll have the time of yottr
life

  in the weeks to come i remembered
that remark and agreed with him-
that i was to have the time of my life
i did not know then of course that
the simple fact of accepting a dinner
invitation was destined nearly to cost
me my life i could not dream of the
strange and far-reaching consequences
that were to ensue

  promptly at eight oclock having in
the meantime togged myself in eve-
ning clothes i presented myself at the
renaissance manners similarly at-
tired was there ahead of me

  were a little early he said the
chief is not here yet

  the chief i interrogated

  old snakes


cobra girl

  eh manners i feared had sud-
denly taken leave of his senses

  i beg your pardon he laughed

  i was referring to runyon-profes-
for john wagamore runyon to be ex-
act

  why the snakes then  i demanded

  he eats em alive

  what my amazement was grow-
ing apace

  the snakes then catching sight
of my puzzled expression oh no
not literally hes just a snake man-
an ophiologist

  a-what

  an ophiologist-that is a person
who is a student of the science of ser-
pents-is up on their habits and modes
of life its a branch of herpetology
you know

  no i didnt know i confessed
frankly but  take your word for
it whats he the chief of

  the mystery club ah here he
is now

  before i had time to question further
i was being presented to professor
john wagamore runyon and as i
looked at him an involuntary shudder
passed through me

  he seemed to me quite to fit his
strange calling for the touch of his
hand was cold and clammy like the
touch of a snake and his close-set bead-
like black eyes gleamed with the sinister
cunning of a serpent

  and yet he was a man of striking ap-
pearance-such a man as would attract
attention in any crowd tall and
straight and spare he was with a sharp
bony leathery face as yellow as old
parchment and topped by the most
wonderful suite of hair that i ever have
seen on a man it was as white as new
snow and tumbled about his collar in
thick ringlets

  mr famworth he repeated ac-
knowledging the introduction with a
most courtly old-world bow and then
turning to manners another

  manners shook his head and left me
puzzled at the by-play

  well in any event i am more than
glad to know mr famworth said
runyon

  his voice soft and silken and insidi-
ous as the soughing of a gentle night
wind got on my nerves instinctively
i did not like him but i put this down
as a silly notion perhaps due to my
aversion to the crawling things that
according to manners were his stock
in trade

  i could see that he was appraising me
through those piercing pin points of
pupils that seemed to swim in ink and
in turn i tried to sum up his character

  he had the nose and chin of deter-
mination yet his mouth was weak
there was strength written in his face
as against a certain furtive fear he
had too cunning and stealth and abil-
ity and intelligence

  as to his age though i could not
have hazarded a guess he certainly
was forty yet he might have been
eighty i remember how my thoughts
ran then

  so this is an ophiologist hence-
forth i shall think of an ophiologist as
a man who looks like a snake

  suppose we go in interposed man-
ners the boys are waiting

  runyon bowed his acquiescence and
signified for me to precede him it
impressed me then that even his move-
ments were soft and sinuous like those
of a snake

  manners nodded to an obsequious
flunkey who conducted us to a floor
above that on which the main cafe was
situated and to the door of a private
suite we entered then a reception
room where we were hailed vocifer-
ously by upwards of a dozen men

  they were mostly young men but a
few grayheads were represented and
a more heterogeneous assemblage i
never had seen forgather for a dinner
cobra girl



at once i tried to identify them by
nationality

  there were an irishman two span-
iards a large fat chinese a german

  they were unlike any men i ever
had known-like a horde of buccaneers
attired in hired evening clothes

  while i was still appraising them and
wondering how i might get away with-
out offending them the door of an ad-
joining room opened and a servitor an-
nounced that dinner was served and
i was mighty glad to see that waiter
he seemed at least a link between me
and the safeguards of civilization that
i had left on the floor below

  while oysters were being served i
morbidly counted the diners only to
receive a shock of superstitious dread

  there were thirteen of them

  yes murmured runyon with a
queer snakelike movement of his
hands you are the thirteenth man

  with what devilish form of con-
science had he interpreted my thoughts
i wondered that fact gave me a thrill
of horror the others however
seemed -not to mind if i might be per-
mitted to judge from the babel of merry
voices about me

  and such a conversation or con-
versations i should say that were go-
ing on across the table from me the
irishman was telling how he had scut-
tled a junk in the china sea one of
the spaniards was boasting of the as-
sassination by himself of a polyne-
sian king the german and chinaman
were comparing notes on the massacre
of a band of natives on the gold coast

  what sort of men were these that
manners had brought me among i
wondered surely they were the worst
type of murderers judging them by
their own admissions but were they
actually murderers as they said

  for a moment i suspected manners
of hoaxing me i looked at him from
the side of my eye he was smiling

i was sure then that he was playing
a scurvy trick on me

  he had framed this thing up for my
especial benefit just to give me a scare
well in that case i should play my
part differently i could assume quite
as much bravado as any of the crew
about me

  air farnworth professor said
manners presently has a hobby for
guns and pistols hes one of the best
shots in the country

  the best i boasted keeping my
face straight

  by and by after i had had several
glasses of wine i began to feel more
at ease with my unusual companions
in fact i was rather enjoying the ex-
perience this state of equanimity
however was not to last long

  i had been noticing from time to
time an unaccountable movement in-
side runyons coat on the side next
me and now there was a more violent
agitation

  marveling i watched with fascinated
eyes until to my horror i saw a forked
tongue dart across the edge of the black
table cloth followed by a flat hideous
head i cried out in horror and sprang
from the table knocking my chair over
with a crash

  what is it  runyon asked the ques-
tion while i again was the object of
general attention oh i see he
added and laughed my little pet
tired of her nest and was taking a bit
of exercise she wouldnt hurt you
mr farnworth

  and then runyon gathered the slimy
thing up and laid its nasty head caress-
ingly against his cheek it was a rat-
tler i noted all of four feet long

  the men about the table laughed at
the incident but i remained standing
until the professor had returned the
snake to his pocket i sat down then
not wishing to be accounted altogether
a coward

  several times my glass was refihcd


cobra girl

and i went on with my dinner when
i again looked about the board i saw
that the men were leaving noiselessly
one by one only manners runyon
myself and the irishman remained and
he in a moment went the way of the
others

  and then for the first time i felt a
strange dizziness i was ill at the
stomach too and i wanted air i was
not drunk i knew but i could not ac-
count otherwise for my condition

  fill up your glass said manners
and drink to the success of the mys-
tery club

 his voice seemed hollow and far
away i tried to speak but i had no
command of words i attempted to wave
him away but my efforts were vain i
saw the amber wine flow into my glass
and then i was conscious of the evil
eyes of runyon burning me with their
very blackness

  drink mr famworth to the suc-
cess of the mystery club i heard him
say

feebly unsteadily i raised my glass
-that is i tried to raise it at the
same time i was conscious that man-
ners was leaving the room-leaving me
alone with the awful runyon

  i tried to call to him to implore him
not to leave me but he was gone be-
fore i could utter a word the glass
fell from my fingers and i felt a chill
as the wine wet me to the skin then
came oblivion

chapter ii

the morning after

if you ever have had a hard night with
the boys you will understand how
i felt when the spark of consciousness
again quickened my mind my mouth
and throat were parched my head ach-
ing my eyes smarting my body sore
and tired i pressed my hot heavy
hands to my throbbing temples and
made the usual vow never again

  i tried to think then of where i had
been and what had happened to me i
remembered the golf club and my
meeting with manners those inci-
dents were quite clear i had a vague
recollection of meeting a strange man
at the renaissance cafe and of dining
with a ferocious band of cutthroat ad-
venturers

  it was all very puzzling and i sat
up to think it over i became con-
scious then of a feeling of nausea
also i discovered that i was in bed
and then i became aware that my bed
was moving-undulating from end to
end with an occasional lurch sidewise
or was it the condition of my head that
made me fancy this

  i stepped painfully to the floor-and
shrank backward as the wall seemed
to lurch forward to strike me or per-
haps i lurched toward the wall i was
not quite sure

  i was determined however to
glimpse the outlook from the small
round window at the head of my bunk
-the only window with which the room
was provided four staggering steps
carried me thither and i gasped with
amazement at what i saw

  below beyond all about me spread
the billowing sunkissed reaches of the
pacific i was at sea

  this then accounted for the antics
of my berth and room i was in a
tiny stateroom and judging by its mean
equipment the ship that was bearing me
away was not by any means of the first
rating

  suddenly the vessel lurched and
hurled me violently against the wall
a great shadow swept out across the
water when i got my legs again it
dawned on me that i was on a sailing
vessel the lean of the ship as it went
about on a new tack and the shadow
cast by the mainsail told me that

  it is difficult to describe the emotions
that surged through me at that mo-
ment fright wonderment anger
cobra girl



commingled and threw me into a panic
i had no recollection of coming aboard
this ship i did not want to go to sea

  i wanted to be back in san francisco
-not because i had anything in par-
ticular to do other than to lounge about
the clubs and pay court to elsie vand-
man but because such a life suited my
sybaritic taste much better than the an-
noyances of ocean travel

  yes it was rather important that i
should press my suit with elsie--not
because i bore any great love for her
but because it was high time that i had
married and settled down and as her
family and mine had been friends for
years it was quite safe and sane for us
to form a matrimonial union

  elsie who was near my own age and
had a fortune in her own right felt
much the same way about it so you
see we had arrived at that time when
marriage becomes a convenience rather
than a pleasure

  but now-well i could not figure
why i was on this ship nor where i was
going in any event though whether
i had come aboard in a moment of
mental aberration or had been brought
at the will of another a substantial
check might induce the captain to put
about and return me to san francisco

  that was the most sensible thought
that had entered my distressed mind
i decided to put it into execution at
once but i was in my underclothes
my outer garments had disappeared
and i had a hesitancy about venturing
on deck in my present attire

  can you fancy my mental state
standing there on a strange vessel in
my underclothes going i knew not
where 

  in the midst of my cogitations i
heard a rusty key scrape in the lock
and the next moment the door was
flung open need i tell you that i was
filled with delight when i saw that the
huge figure of chilling manners filled
the aperture

  what ho he cried gayly

  i noticed that he was clad roughly
in coarse trousers and a gray flannel
shirt open at the throat

  what was the idea of locking me
in and making it necessary for me to
yell at all i demanded now that i
had to deal with manners i was afraid
no longer i could afford to assert my-
self i thought

  well say famworth he drawled
and treated me to a queer smile if you
could have seen yourself when you
came in here you would be wondering
why we did not put you in irons and a
straight jacket

  what do you mean

  why my boy you were a bit-er
-violent i may say if i might ven-
ture an opinion you had been drinking
a little too much

  manners tone seemed patronizing
and i did not particularly like it his
full round good-natured face however
was beaming with kindly humor

  how then did i manage to get
aboard this ship

 dont you remember  but of
course you dont well naturally your
friends-professor runyon and i-
carried you aboard you remember of
course joining the mystery club and

after-

  joining the mystery gubi i cried
indignantly i remember nothing of
the sort manners

  but you did old man before you
went under let me show you

 manners drew a wallet from his
back pocket and extracted a sheet of
paper therefrom which he handed to
me you may fancy my horrified
amazement when i read these lines

  agreement entered into this day between
john wagamore runyon party of the first
part and douglas famworth party of the
second part the said party of the second
part hereby becomes a voluntary member of
the mystery club and for a period of six
months from date places his services abso-
lutely at the command of the said party of


cobra girl

the first part in consideration whereof he
shall receive food and lodging and if it be
his good fortune to return to san francisco
the sum of one thousand dollars in cash
this money has been deposited in trust in
his name and should he fail to return for
any reason it will revert to chilling manners

  this strange agreement was dated in
san francisco on the day before and
bore the signatures of runyon and my-
self with that of manners as a witness

  with the document still in my hand
i sank weakly on the side of my bunk
and stared stupidly at manners

chapter iii

into the eastern seas

to state my situation briefly i was
virtually a prisoner on the
schooner bonaventure in company with
these men whom i had met at the mys-
tery club dinner

  i scarcely need describe the succeed-
ing six weeks except to say that the
interval enabled me to establish friend-
ships with several members of the crew
we passed to the south of the hawaiian
group but did not sight land indeed
though i had become almost reconciled
to my lot

  at the end of six weeks i was as
brown as any white man aboard the
ship due to exposure to the tropical
sun and my muscles were as hard as
steel for which fact i had to thank
my voluntary descent to plebeian labor

  in truth i had come to enjoy the
novelty of my experience just as man-
ners had said i might and i thought
no more of taking a bucket and mop
and swabbing the deck than i had about
a game of golf or billiards two months
previously

  also i had taken example from the
other men-went barefoot and allowed
my beard to grow i smiled more than
once when i glanced into the small
mirror that adorned my cabin and won-
dered should a vote be taken if i would
not be adjudged as desperate a looking

adventurer as there was cm the bona-
venture

  during these days too i managed to
filch an automatic pistol from the mas-
ters cabin and acquired a certain tol-
erance for runyon though i still dis-
liked him heartily also i made at
least one firm friendship

  this was with a chinaman who
called himself ling wah a splendid
stalwart fellow was ling who despite
the usual oriental inscrutability and
reserve had traveled the world over
possessed a fund of information an
excellent education and spoke english
quite well i was considerably puzzled
about ling he did not take me fully
into his confidence but from casual
remarks that he made i surmised that
he had descended from the nobility of
china but for some reason was an
exile from his native land

  try as i might i could not even guess
the potential purposes of the mystery
club if manners knew he would not
tell me but always was he agreeable
and tolerant regarding my frequent
questioning

  well i reasoned at length i would
know some time the real object of the
mystery club and the purpose of the
bonaventures cruise into far eastern
waters and really i had grown keen
for the adventure even though at
times my mind did stray to far-off
frisco

  i was worried particularly about
elsie vandman and what she must
think of me the day that we had fixed
tentatively for our wedding had passed
and i had been unable even to get word
to her

  would she think that i was dead or
would she believe that i had willfully
deserted at the brink of the altar
these thoughts gave me many moments
of mental disease however i was
helpless and worry would avail me
nothing

  time passed monotonously and
cobra girl



from the distance that we had covered
without seeming to be any nearer our
destination it began to look to me as
if the strange old ophiologist who was
directing our destinies intended to cir-
cumnavigate the globe

  day piled on day while we plowed
through the south china sea skirted
the philippines and made for the strait
of malacca past singapore and the
peaks of sumatra we raced and on into
the bay of bengal

  one morning i awoke to find india
where the eastern ghats frame the
shore looming before us northward
we continued until we reached yanaon
and the mouth of the godavari and
when the bonaventure swept into the
river i felt that we were approaching
the end of our long cruise

chapter iv

a girl and a fight

je progressed slowly up the goda-
vari and as the river narrowed
i sensed an atmosphere of suppressed
excitement aboard the bonaventure it
seemed to pervade the entire company
and even i though unable to attribute
any real cause suffered from the tense
strain

  i thought perhaps that it might be
due to overstrained nerves the result
of the long trying voyage and the un-
certainty of the outcome

  for the first time since we had left
san francisco old snakes frequented
the deck and made himself agreeable
to the men he ordered liberal por-
tions of whisky for their consumption
and almost at any hour of the day or
night he might be found nervously pac-
ing from the forecastle to after deck
eagerly scanning the shore line

  by the time we had traversed two
hundred miles of the stream i felt that
i was quite well versed in jungle lore

  late one afternoon i was puzzled
by the actions of runyon and manners

they had been standing in the peak for
an hour conversing more or less ex-
citedly and in low tones while they
bent from time to time over a sheet
of paper that the professor held was
this the treasure map i wondered

  there it is i heard manners cry
excitedly pointing shoreward

  the bonaventure now under her
auxiliary power swung around in a
half circle and headed directly for
what appeared to be an abandoned
temple on the bank and then to my
surprise i noticed a small wharf its
timers rotted with age to this we
made the ship fast

  came the swift tropical night and
a huge brilliantly luminous moon trans-
muted the yellow stream into molten
silver runyon had served whisky in
plenty among the men and several al-
ready had become maudlin while
others engaged in bickerings and minor
quarrels over their cards

  to me this seemed almost a dese-
cration of the heavenly night-a foul
blot on the tranquil scene wherein the
spice-laden breezes bore to our ears a
weird medley from the throats of the
jungle creatures

  for this reason perhaps i was
strangely ill at ease or was it a pre-
monition of something that was about
to happen i did not know i was
conscious only of a sense of apprehen-
sion and lonesomeness

  i strolled off alone and leaning
against the rail tried to penetrate the
jungle tangle wondering the while
what lay beyond that had brought the
bonaventure and her men to this far
distance

  what was that was i suffering
from delusion had i seen a ghost or
had my strained nerves merely caused
my fancy to conjure a human form up
there peering over one of the balconies
of the temple

  as surely as i was standing there on
the deck of the bonaventure i had


cobra girl

seen the face and shoulders of a
woman it was but a momentary
glance that i had had of her but the
impression had been vivid the image
lingered

  she was clothed in white and a mass
of black hair tumbled over one of the
most radiantly beautiful faces that it
ever had been my good fortune to be-
hold her eyes black as midnight
seemed to have caught the starlight
and to match even the low-hanging
moon for brilliance

  my impulse was to explore the temple
-to find the girl who had looked at
me she was not a native i knew
and perhaps she needed help i dont
remember ever before of having set
out deliberately to befriend strange
women but there was something so
appealing in this face that i had seen
-an element of pathos that stirred me
to the depths

  at home i know i should not have
bothered but here out in the jungle
wilds a certain spirit of romance
seemed to possess me i was quite mad
i know however i recked not of
consequences when i leaped from the
rail of the bonaventure to the little
wharf by the side of the temple

  first i went to the end of the small
dock and skirted the temple hoping
that i might find an entrance on the
land side there was a door but it
was locked

  a window higher up attracted my
attention it was pandess and by a
flying leap i thought that i might be
able to reach the sill i stepped back
a few paces ran and jumped my
fingers closed on the window sill above
and it was an easy matter to draw my
body through the aperture

  i found myself in a square empty
room on the floor of which reposed the
dust of ages i could feel the dust
soft under my feet and could see it in
the moonlight which poured through a
window opposite

  the light of the moon also disclosed
a flight of steep narrow stairs in one
corner i listened intently there was
no sound save the boisterous laughter
of the men on the bonaventure and the
cries of the jungle habitants

  i confess now that i was possessed
of a strange creepy sensation and that
cold fear clutched at my stomach-a
fear of the unknown and the intangible
however i was determined to see
again the girl who had peered at me on
the deck of the schooner

  there was some sense of safety in
the automatic that i carried-the pistol
that i had filched from the gun room of
the bonaventure i drew it reverentiy
from my pocket examined it and found
that it was ready for service with the
weapon in my hand then i mounted
the stairs

  i crept up cautiously and found my-
self in another room the exact counter-
part of the one below except that it was
smaller it also was empty i went
to the window on the river side and
looked down on the schooner but this
was not the level from which the girl
had gazed down at us

  it required another urge to my cour-
age to mount the next flight of stairs
but i accomplished it both relief and
disappointment mingled when i saw
that the third room also was deserted
it was from the balcony outside the
window of this room however that she
had looked down but she was gone
gone where  i wondered

  i made an examination of the dusty
floor and i was rewarded by the sight
of tiny footprints i followed them
down to the floor on which i had en-
tered there they marked a course to
a staircase that led downward

  i took the stairs which brought me
to the water level and there the trail
ended the moisture of the river had
dispelled the dust and there was no evi-
dence of the girls passage nor was
there anything to indicate her presence
cobra girl



  i went to the door-the one that i
had found locked on the outside-and
thought that it might have a spring lock
which would enable her to have gained
egress but it was bolted on the inside

  this puzzled me sorely how had
the girl escaped from the place had
she leaped from the window by which
i had entered  that must be it i rea-
soned well i should have to leave
by the same means

  i returned to the first room a small
glittering object that had escaped my
notice before now attracted my atten-
tion i seized it eagerly from the floor

  it was a gold heart such as one gives
to a baby and there was a little ring
at the top through which to pass a
chain but more than the heart itself
was the name that was engraved there-
on i read it by the light of the moon-
zadra

  what a strange name i thought
was it the name of the girl whom i had
been seeking in the temple had she
lost this bauble in any event the
name interested me i felt that i should
like to know the one who was called
zadra

  as i had entered the temple so i
departed i turned toward the jungle
and to my amazement discovered a
road that led inland it had become
weed-grown through disuse but there
remained the clearly defined trail of a
corduroy highway

  curiosity impelled me to follow this
road into the dark depths of the jungle
and for some reason i had ceased to
be afraid i had a notion that the girl
had traversed this same road only a few
minutes before and if it were safe for
her it also held no terrors for me

  then too a woman could not proceed
very far through the jungle at night
her home must be near and without
doubt i should find it after a short
walk

  for half an hour i continued on-
ward pausing now and then in the hope

of hearing fleeing footsteps ahead of
me i was mad of course but i did
not realize it at the time

  my reward came presently when i
arrived at a pretentious clearing in the
center of which a gleaming white
palace reared its stately domes and min-
arets i paused in a maze of bewilder-
ment

  my first thought was that i was look-
ing upon a mirage i could not con-
ceive that so magnificent a structure
could actually exist here in the midst of
the jungle a light though flared
suddenly from one of the many win-
dows and convinced me that the man-
sion before me was real

  and then i saw a white apparition
with a mass of black hair that fell about
her shoulders emerge from a smaller
structure at the left and stand silhou-
etted in the moonlight

  zadra

  the name leaped to my lips unbidden
and intuitively i started forward but
at the same moment i heard a slight
commotion in the undergrowth at my
side i turned just in time to avoid
the full force of a blow that had been
aimed at my head with a club

  it struck me glancingly and i reeled
in a daze i raised my pistol swiftly
and fired at my assailant but the same
instant i became conscious that other
dark forms were emerging from the
shadows and pressing close around me

  i realized that i was in for a fight
but i had not rallied from the effect of
the first blow when a cloth was thrown
over my head and i felt the pressure
of many hands i was helpless and
did not know even if my first and
only shot had taken effect

  incidents however were crowding
each other in rapid succession scarcely
had i been made prisoner when i heard
a womans voice she spoke in a
strange tongue but i fancied from her
tone that she was giving a sharp com-
mand to my captors


cobra girl

  and somehow i caught the impres-
sion that it was a friendly voice in
any event the hands of my captors fell
away and the cloth with which i had
been so deftly bound was snatched from
my head i grasped my pistol which
lay undisturbed on the ground and
scrambled to my feet

  come commanded a sweet voice
at my side

  it was she-the girl whom i had seen
in the temple on the godavari

chapter v

the garden of the snakes

ctill in a daze i stood frozen to
the spot all had happened so
swiftly that i scarcely could believe that
it was real and that i prosaic clubman
was the center of such an adventure
i half expected ling to come to my
bunk and give me a shaking and tell me
that it was time for me to take the
watch

  the revolver that i still held in my
hand was genuine enough however and
they were no dream men-those dark
objects that were scampering to cover
in the underbrush

  nor was the girl at my side a mere
figment of morbid imagination i
looked across the moonlit space toward
the palace still it stood there in
stately grandeur no i was not dream-
ing

  come repeated the girl

  she blessed me with a radiant smile
and i took a step toward her mechant
cally slipping the pistol into my pocket
as i did

  anywhere-with you i replied gal-
lantly

  to an observer i fancy that i must
have appeared foolish but to me at
that moment things seemed to be just
as they should be i did not know that
it was moon madness or the spirit of
romance that had taken possession of
me

  and then she stretched out a white
slender hand and took hold of mine
i confess i was thrilled by the soft pres-
sure of her fingers-that my heart be-
gan to pound madly at the contact with
her friend or foe i was prepared to
go wherever she might lead me

  was she friend or foe i asked my-
self she had performed one friendly
act-and yet might she not have dis-
persed my enemies only to find an
easier way of disposing of me who
was she i wondered what was she
doing here what was the secret of
her power over the natives who had
attacked me what indeed was the
secret of her power over me for she
did exercise a strange compelling
power that i could not fathom

  at the moment i would have done
anything that she had commanded i
would have fought for her died for
her i had an insane desire to fall at
her small sandaled feet and kiss the
hem of her flowing white robe

  like a goddess she stood there in
the moonlight head upflung eyes gleam-
ing lips parted hair flowing in a mas
of ringlets over her perfect shoulders

  come she said again and again
she pressed my fingers and started in
the direction of the palace

  i followed by her side without pro-
test i knew not where she was taking
me nor for what purpose but i en-
joyed a thrill of gladness just to be
there with her

  she was tall-only a head shorter
than i-and young i guessed her age
at twenty and in a quick appraisement
took her to be an american

  where are we going i ventured
to ask presently

  to the temple she responded and
the voice of her filled my ears as with
sweet music

  to the temple i gasped but this
is not the direction i just left there
and-

  you do not know the temple to
cobra girl

i

which i am taking you she inter-
rupted

  why do you wish to take me there
i inquired

  because i like you was her frank
avowal

  because you like me her ingenu-
ousness rather startled me and i won-
dered indeed what she could find in
me to admire-a bronzed disheveled
half-dressed specimen of humanity
who might have been a buccaneer from
his appearance-or worse

  because i do not wish you to be
killed she supplemented

 who-who wants to kill me i
gasped

  evidently the naib of nagpur
his men were the ones who attacked
you

  why  i had done nothing to them

  they thought you might i suppose
you had trespassed on the naibs ter-
ritory and-well they probably fancied
that you might be of some service to
me

  i wish that i might be of service
to you i hastened please tell me
how i may serve you

  i shall but hurry now

  i had seen nothing alarming heard
nothing but she seemed to have sensed
a lurking danger and began to cast ap-
prehensive glances over one shoulder

  i grasped my pistol tightly and de-
termined not to be taken again by sur-
prise there were ten shots there-
nine now since i had discharged one
-and with my skill as a marksman i
felt able to cope with half a dozen men
at least-provided i saw them coming

  we shall be quite safe in the tem-
ple she panted she had quickened
her pace almost to a run and was
breathing heavily

  let us go back to my ship i sug-
gested we would be safe there

  oh no no not now they would
be lying in wait for us in the jungle

  we had been skirting the edge of the

clearing and now were passing the pal-
ace but the girl went on until before
us rose a small pagoda on the edge of
the jungle she slackened her pace
then and gave a sigh of relief

  the temple she said we are
safe now

  the building i noticed was sur-
rounded by a small garden she bade
me pause at the outer gate i followed
her instructions of course but i was
puzzled by the appearance of half a
dozen dark objects that lay in the path
to the pagoda in the deceptive light
of the moon they looked like rope ends
but a creepy intuitive sensation told
me that they were not

  what are those things in the walk 
i asked

  snakes-cobras she replied uncon-
cernedly you wait here for a mo-
ment

  i shrank back in alarm since child-
hood i had heard and read stories of
the deadliness of the cobra-di-capello
the sacred snake of india i knew that
thousands every year paid toll with their
lives to the venom of the reptiles bite

  even though i stood twenty feet from
the sluggish crawling monsters and
held a pistol in my hand i was seized
with a thrill of horror the girl stepped
into the garden but i seized her
roughly by the shoulders and drew her
back

  where are you going i gasped
dont you know it is certain death to
enter there

  she laughed lightly and looked at me
with level luminous eyes

  and dont you know that it is more
certain death not to go she retorted
look behind you

  i turned quickly and to my further
alarm saw several skulking forms mak-
ing their way in our direction they
were not more than two hundred yards
distant we were between two fires
but i preferred to risk a battle with the
men than with the snakes


cobra girl

  just then a noise in the garden drew
my attention in that direction

  you vixen cried the girl

  my god i cried and started for-
ward

  the blood seemed to congeal in my
veins for there in the middle of the
path stood the girl she was holding
one of the cobras in her hands by neck
and tail shaking it as she might have
shaken a mischievous puppy and then
she raised the thing above her head
and flung it from her into the bushes

  all the other snakes but one had dis-
appeared and before i could reach her
she had darted at this one with her bare
hands seized it back of the head and
thrown it from the path

 good god i gasped why did
you do that

  so that you might enter in safety
she replied simply

  so that  might enter in safety i
repeated in amazement it was won-
derful of you to take such a desperate
chance for me why should you

  i took no chance

  but suppose you had been bitten
i insisted you would have been

dead-

  i was bitten she interrupted but
i am not going to die my dear friend
see

  to my horror she held up for my
inspection a slender white hand on the
back of which appeared two drops of
blood i was dazed stupefied i had
no idea of an antidote and felt that
this fair creature had sacrificed her life
to do me a service

  but-but i stammered stupidly
the bite of a cobra is certain death

and-

  to you of course but not to me
she interposed look  she put her
dainty mouth over the punctures that
that snake had made then brushed her
other hand lightly across the slight
wound now it is all over she
smiled

  all over i repeated

  quite all over i have been bitten
many times but this is the first in a
long while that fellow was savage
and didnt seem to like being disturbed
but the snakes you see are my friends
-the best fqiends i ever have known
in the world

  as she ceased speaking a dreamy
far-away look came into her eyes and
i fancied that a great tear dropped to
her cheek

  one must have some friends she
went on in a melodious monotone and
the snakes have been my friends-my
preservers

  it seemed uncanny to me that a
woman thus should be bitten by the
most venomous snake that lives and
suffer no ill effect from it

  are you a woman of the flesh or a
goddess i demanded

  they call me the daughter of siva
she laughed but come let us go in-
side do you not see that our enemies
are approaching

  i followed the graceful sweep of her
arm and noted that half a dozen
crouching forms were lurking on the
edge of the jungle only a few yards
distant

  let me lead the way she suggested
to be sure that none of my friends gets
his fangs into you

  i permitted her to go ahead for
myself i preferred to guard our retreat
against a rush from the natives none
was attempted however and a mo-
ment later we entered the temple

chapter vi

the daughter of siva

i scarcely can describe my first
impression of the temple as the
door opened i was struck by the strong
odor of burning sandalwood it was
being offered as incense no doubt but
in the gloom of the ante-chamber in
which i found myself i could not see
cobra girl



where it was being used nor who was
burning it

  from a door on the far side of the
room however came a faint red glow
and i fancied that the smoke was com-
ing from within

  be quiet admonished my charming
guide nana may be at prayer

  nana i interrogated

  my faithful old servant-god bless
her she explained

  in this heathen temple i was sur-
prised to hear the girl mention the name
of god but i ventured no comment on
the anomaly

  you left the door open i reminded
her apprehensively

  yes of course the moonlight will
enable us to see better

  but those fellows will follow us i
said

  not in here she laughed softly
they fear me they respect their gods
-and they both fear and respect
the cobras

  i shuddered at her reference to
the cobras i too feared them though
i did not respect them

  let us see if nana is within she
said

  she walked softly toward the interior
door while i stalked closely at her
heels and what i saw looking over
her shoulder contributed still further
to the uncanny dread that had obsessed
me ever since i had seen what the girl
was pleased to call her friends in
the garden

  before me on a low altar were three
hideous idols-a large one in the cen-
ter and a smaller one on each side
a huge vessel at the base of the altar
belched forth clouds of aromatic smoke
while from the ceiling hung a massive
lamp that shed a spectral red glow
over the place on the floor with head
pressed to a small mat was the form
of a thin old woman

  nana said the girl softly as i
thought she is at prayer

    a thrill

  praying to those horrible images
i remarked scornfully

  no she prays only to vishnu the
preserver on the left but the naib
you see is a reformed brahman he
worships the trinity so in his private
temple he has brahma in the center
with vishnu on one side and siva the
destroyer on the other

  and you are the daughter of siva
i mused

  i said that that was what they called
me she turned away that nanas
worship might not be interrupted and
laughed softly it is well too thafe
the natives so have dubbed me
why i asked vacuously

  because their superstition has beeiv
my preservation you see they are
amazed by the way i handle the
snakes

  ugh the snakes i interrupted
with an involuntary shudder and looked
apprehensively about to see that nme
was crawling at my feet

  the girl paused while i waited for
her to go on with her story

  please continue-zadra i legged
at length

  zadra she flashed and gave me
a queer look

  pardon me i hastened the
name slipped from my lips inadvert-
ently i should have said miss zadra

  no that is not it she returned
i should like you to call me just zadra
but i am curious to know how you
learned my name

  i found a locket in the temple by
the river after you were there to-night
and the name was engraved on it
oh a look of infinite relief
spread over her face while she thanked
me profusely for its return my father
gave it to me when i was a child she
explained and so she added myou
were in the old house too how did
you get in 

  leaped through a window

  and why


cobra girl

  to find you

  why did you wish to find me
because i-oh i dont know why
i faltered i saw you looking over
the balcony and i was lonesome i
guess-and perhaps a bit curious why
were you there

  i  she seemed startled by my
question why i go there often-
always in the hope that i might find
a ship with a kindly master who will
take me away from this terrible place
but always they are afraid of the naib
of nagpur

  im sure the master of the bonaven-
fure will not be afraid of him i as-
sured her

  you think not  oh i hope that you
are right there was eagerness in her
voice and she touched me with one of
her slender hands i noticed then that
she was trembling

  how did you get in and out of the
ow house by the river i inquired ir-
relevantly

  i suppose that is a secret she re-
plied however i dont mind telling
you there is an underground pas-
sage from the palace it was designed
to give the naib a means of escape to
die river in case of attack but it has
fallen into decay and the ground has
caved in just beyond the far side of the
clearing so you see it is easy for me
to reach the river without being ob-
served

  thats splendid i cried well
hike right back there and be safely
aboard the bonaventure within half an
hour

  not to-night she said quietly
come here and look

  she led me to the door being care-
ful to keep out of the stream of moon-
shine that was pouring in and swung
her arm significantly in a graceful semi-
circle a dozen skulking forms only
half concealed by the shadows of tree
and building told me that my foes were
closing in

  but you said they were afraid of
you i reminded her and i can take
care of myself

  its of no use to be foolhardy she
protested and on second thought i
agreed with her

  what shall we do then i asked

  wait until morning and in the
meantime get some sleep

  that indeed was a sensible sugges-
tion  though i did not fancy that i
should do much sleeping my nerves
were too much on edge my surround-
ings too strange my apprehension too
great

  the self-assurance of zadra how-
ever gave me confidence and courage
and queerly enough i had no feeling
of fear despite the enemies who lurked
in the shadows outside

  we strolled back toward the inner
door zadra and i and again i peered
into the weird dimness of the cella
the old woman was rising from her
prayers and delivering herself of a
final incarnation

  the huge censer was emitting now
only a thin spiral of smoke the red
light that swung above had grown more
dim but in the uncertain glow i now
discerned a double row of squat round
baskets ranged alongside one of the
walls

  what are they i asked

 takra

  takra i repeated i dont un-
derstand-

  baskets for the snakes she in-
formed me

  again i shuddered at mention of
those deadly cobras i was not afraid
of human foes but even a thought of
the snakes filled me with dread i won-
dered if the baskets were filled with the
filthy reptiles but did not question
further

  the old woman now was coming for-
ward and at sight of me stopped in
alarm zadra said something to her in
cobra girl



her native tongue however then turned
to me

  you did not tell me your name she
said

 pardon me-douglas farnworth
i hastened

  again she spoke to nana and the
emaciated old hag bent me a grave
curtsy then in a strange jargon she
addressed zadra

 she says zadra informed me
that she can make you comfortable for
the night in one of the upper rooms
she is a dear kindly old soul is nana
-fetches my food from the palace and
always seems to anticipate my wishes

  fetches your food from the pal-
ace i repeated in amazement i
thought that you and the naib were
enemies-

  ah no not exactly enemies she
interrupted he would like to have
me in the palace but he is afraid of
me and it is well he like the others
has the superstitious belief that i am
the daughter of siva but come  nana
is ready to conduct you good night
and pleasant dreams-douglas

  she hesitated but the fraction of a
second over the use of my given name
and i confess that the way she said it
the dainty little twist of pronunciation
that was distinctly her own not only
surprised but delighted me and then
her starlike eyes her full red lips joined
in a smile of rare witchery while her
hand went out to meet mine

  good night zadra i said simply
then turned to follow my aged con-
ductor

 as i made my way up the dark
winding stairs that occupied one comer
of the outer room i could see zadra
still standing in the moonlight following
me with her eyes and the heart of
me seemed to swell and beat faster and
i was filled with a strange intangible
tenderness for the lonely girl below
then i lay down and slept

chapter vii

  the naib makes an attack

i heard the pounding on my door i
leaped from my couch to find the
sun high in the heavens and the wel-
come light of day pouring in at my open
window my visitor was nana with a
tray of steaming native viands which
she proffered for my breakfast

  before i had finished eating there
came another knock at my door and
to my delight the one who sought ad-
mission was zadra

  i hope you spent a comfortable
night was her greeting

  i assured her that i had

  to-day i hope we may be able to
reach your ship she said abruptly

  to-day we shall reach my ship i
assured her emphatically

  i dont know-douglas i fear that
they are on the watch

  suppose they are i demanded
boldly you say that they will not dis-
turb you and i am quite sure that i
can fight my way to the river

  ah no i would not permit you to
do that you do not know the naib
of nagpur

  why are you here apparently so
much in his power i ventured to ask
he took me

 took you how

  i was with my father on a scientific
expedition in india when the naib saw
and seemed to admire me his men ab-
ducted me one night and brought me
to this place the naib wanted me he
said for his wife but i loathed the
creature of course

  and one day in the palace when he
attempted to put his hands on me i
seized a cobra with which a faker was
amusing the household and flung it in
the naibs face it did not bite him but
the commotion that i caused enabled me
to escape

  as i left the palace i conceived an
idea and grabbed a tubri that was ly-
cobra girl

ing in one of the halls doubtless the
property of the faker i-

  a tubri i inquired

  an instrument that they use for
charming the snakes she explained
with this i went into the jungle and
played to the snakes and they came to
me douglas-several of them i knew
that they could not injure me-that i
was immune from their bite-and they
were my only defense my only pro-
tection for the hindu you know has
a reverence for the cobra and a whole-
some fear of its bite

  with three of the snakes in my hand
i came here into the little private temple
of the naib of course his henchmen
sought me with the intent to take me
back to the palace but i threatened
them with the snakes and they re-
treated and then much to my advan-
tage one of the superstitious natives
conceived the notion that i was the
daughter of their god siva because of
my ability to handle their sacred cobras
without injury to myself i suppose it
did startle them she paused and
laughed

  but really there is nothing at all
supernatural about it fortunately for
me though the naib became convinced
that there was and provided me with
nana and permitted me to dwell here
in his temple but i have waited-oh
how i have waited for my deliverance 

  and it has come at last i assured
her

  i know that my heart must have been
in my eyes as i looked across the table
at her and the glance that she gave me
back caused me a strange palpitating
thrill such as i never had known be-
fore

  but tell me i urged how it is tht
you are able to handle those reptiles
and why their venom has no effect on
you

  zadras musical laugh rang out and
charmed me even as the shrill music
of her tubri must have charmed the

crawling creatures that had been her
protectors there was a strange fas-
cination about the girl that i could not
define she was so sweet so innocent
and yet so sophisticated

  i confess to my shame that i had
forgotten elsie vandman and my prom-
ise to wed her zadra had made me
forget all else in the short space of a
dozen brief hours but the moon mad-
ness maybe still had hold of me

  no  dont mean that i was exactly
in love with zadra i had not defined
my feeling for her as such but-well
i did not know i was in too great a
turmoil to know exactly how i did feel
the soft voice of the girl across the
table from me interrupted my thoughts

  i suppose it does seem spooky to
you how i manage to handle the co-
bras she was saying but indeed it
is very simple you see my father-
listen

  stopping her speech abruptly she
arose excitedly and sprang to the win-
dow i turned and watched her and
to my ears came the shrill tones of a
strange musical instrument i got up
and followed her to the window to find
her staring wide-eyed at something
that was happening in the direction of
the palace and then my gaze focused
on an amazing sight

  at the entrance to the small garden
that surrounded the temple three men
were sitting tailor fashion on the
ground one was playing an elongated
fife that from zadras description i
took to be a tubri a second was beat-
ing with his hands on a kind of drum
and a third was attending to half a
dozen low round baskets that the night
before in the cella zadra had desig-
nated as takra

  nor was this all that i saw one by
one a trail of brown-backed cobras was
wriggling in the direction of the music
one by one the man who had charge of
the baskets was making them captive
i could not understand the strange
cobra girl



scene until i heard zadras amazed ex-
pression

  they are stealing my snakes she
cried

  sealing your snakes i repeated
stupidly

  dont you see what they are doing
the naib has got some snake charmers
to imprison my snakes-my weapons of
defense oh if he gets those snakes
we are lost maybe he has awakened
from his belief that i am the daughter
of siva maybe now he is afraid only
of the snakes and he is taking them
away from me so that his men may
storm the temple and make captives of
me and you

  he wont v i said determinedly

  i had made a sudden resolve it
would be quite easy for me to pick the
snake charmers off with my automatic
and preserve all the weapons that would
avail in our prospective fight to gain
our liberty with this intention in view
i drew my pistol

  what are you going to do cried
zadra

  shoot em i said briefly

  oh can you

  i caught eagerly at the note of pleas-
ure in her voice and was encouraged
i had thought at first that she might
not approve of this manner of ridding
ourselves of the snake charmers i
raised my pistol quickly and aimed at
the man with the tubri but idropped
it just as quickly as two scores of other
actors appeared on the scene

  suddenly from the far edge of the
clearing a volley of shots rang out a
body of natives armed with long old-
fashioned guns came into view pur-
sued by a band of white men

  they came from the jungle along
the corduroy road that i had traversed
the night before and evidently the
fight had been a running one with the
natives in retreat but battling stub-
bornly over every inch of ground

even at the distance that separated us
i recognized the pursuers

  the men from the bonaventure
i gasped

  your friends breathed zadra

  yes thank god i said fervently
and i must get out there and help
them

  no

  her tone was commanding and as
i attempted to turn from the window
she laid a firm had on my arm but
the look in her eyes more than her weak
physical restraint caused me to pause

   i must zadra i said quietly

  rut i-i need you she trembled

   another volley followed by scattered
shots came from the warring factions
i hesitated not quite determined where-
in lay my duty and my thoughts
raced quickly here was a girl alone
defenseless outside were my com-
rades  and in my hand was an automatic
pistol that contained nine shots with
my skill as a marksman those nine shots
might turn the tide of battle for them

  as i was thinking thus zadra turned
to the window suddenly i saw her
face go white and her arms with an
impulsive involuntary movement went
out

  praise god it is-it is he she
cried

chapter viii

the battle of the cobras

i admit that i was excited and eager

   to be down there in the clearing in
the midst of the fray for here i rea-
soned must be the treasure that runyon
brought his strange crew across the
long reaches of the pacific to find

  the naib of nagpur no doubt was
the keeper of that treasure and the
naib of nagpur had been the oppres-
sor of the girl who stood by my side
thus if only i could take part in the
fight i might serve a double purpose
but the secondary purpose i realized
had become the first i wanted to


cobra girl

avenge the wrongs that had been done
to zadra

  i had not heard all of her story but
i knew enough to make me ache to
have the naib by the throat or prefer-
ably to plant a bullet in his yellow body

  it is-it is repeated zadra ex-
citedly

  is what i demanded

  my father she breathed

  your father-who i gasped

  the man there with the white hair
oh some one must have told him he
has come to rescue me and last night
i did not know that he was on that
vessel at the dock

 whom do you mean-professor
runyon i questioned amazedly

  yes-professor runyon-he is my
father

  the girls breath was coming in
gasps her face was pale her small fists
were clenched and i confess that i
was in a maze of bewilderment so
zadra was his daughter

  my first realization of the fact left
me rather sick at heart because i had
no great regard for runyon i thought
that he was not trustworthy and i was
quite convinced that he had done me
a great injustice in bringing me to this
far clime in the condition that i was m
that last night in san francisco

  however if zadra were his daughter
i must reconstruct my opinion of him
for zadra i was forced to admit to
myself was a superlative woman

  and then there was another point
to consider doubtless it was due to
the training of the queer old ophiologist
that she was able to handle the deadly
cobras as she did  and the cobras not
only had saved her honor but perhaps
her life as well that indeed was
something for which to thank the old
man

  another thought struck me with the
force of a great revelation runyon
had told us that there would be no
treasure to divide was the treasure

he had in mind this beautiful daughter
was it to rescue her that he had brought
us across the seas if so i decided the
prize was well worth all the trouble

  look cried zadra the natives
have taken shelter behind a corner of
the palace our men are at a disad-
vantage

  i saw at a glance the truth of her
words the natives now were strongly
entrenched behind a wing of the build-
ing in such a manner that they could
command the further approach of the
enemy without exposing themselves to
fire

  and my comrades i noted were in
a quandary i saw runyon and man-
ners hold a brief consultation then lead
their men in a hasty retreat to the
jungle doubtless they had a flank
movement in mind but they were con-
cealed by the undergrowth and i could
not observe their further progress

  i had intended just at that moment
to open fire on the natives from my po-
sition in the hope of driving them from
cover but the fear that my comrades
were leaving and would not back up
my attack in which event the natives
might storm and take the temple de-
terred me i was thinking too of the
protection of zadra

  while i was wondering what next
would happen a side door of the palace
opened and there isued forth a tall
richly-attired native at the head of a
dozen followers they went to join the
others who had repulsed the men from
the bonaventure

  thats the naib informed zadra

  as i looked at the fellow i thought
how easy it would be to plant a bullet
in his heart but i refrained for the
reason that had deterred me before i
noticed however that the snake charm-
ers had deserted their baskets and had
nm to join the native forces at the
palace

  i can help cried zadra suddenly

  how i demanded eagerly
cobra girl



  wait-watch she replied

  she was gone in a moment hastening
down the spiral staircase to the floor
below i cast a final glance from the
window saw that the natives still held
their position found no trace of the
men from the bonaventure and fol-
lowed zadra

  when i reached the lower level i
found nana carrying the takra from
the cella into the front room while
zadra squatting in the doorway was
making weird music on a tubri

  while i sensed her purpose i gained
ocular proof of it when i saw to my
horror a procession of cobras start
from the bushes in the garden and cir-
cle about her with heads erect hoods
flattened bodies swaying to the rythmi-
cal beat of the music

  i drew back with instinctive dread
and stood shivering like a rat in a cor-
ner while zadra grasped the snakes
one by one and thrust them into the
baskets and when a basket was full
of its wriggling contents zadra would
clamp the lid down and nana carry it
to the far end of the room

  i was amazed fascinated by the num-
ber of snakes that came in answer to
the call and the manner in which they
were made captive it was all so star-
tlingly weird so unusual so appallingly
uncanny that i stood like one in a trance
until it had been finished indeed i
like the hundred or more snakes that
had been imprisoned had been charmed
by the shrill incantation of zadras tu-
bri

  she arose finally flushed radiant
smiling and i stood there still like a
stupid fool looking at her with open-
mouthed wonderment

  now i am prepared for them she
said lightly

  you are a witch i murmured

  oh no doifglas she laughed
only i am a very practical person

  and how i inquired are you pre-
pared for them

  i am to them the daughter of
siva she replied enigmatically they
are afraid of me and they have a cer
tain reverence for the cobra and you
shall see wait

  it was a comfort to my overwrought
nerves that we did not have long to wait
for a few minutes later the shooting
was resumed in a desultory way i
could see nothing from the lower door
so hastened to the window above ac-
companied by zadra

  then i saw that the men from the
schooner had planted at least one tell-
ing shot the natives at the direction
of the naib were removing an inert
member of their force from the field of
battle while the others were covering
the operation with an attack on a point
in the jungle to the left of the temple

  i could see nothing of my comrades
however though an occasional report
of a rifle told me that they were attempt-
ing sniping from the concealment of a
grove of blackwood the natives how-
ever merely shifted their position
slightly so that they were protected by
another angle of the wall

  to me though they were in plain
view and open to my fire

  i did not acquaint zadra with my in-
tention but raised my pistol quickly
and took a snapshot at a big native who
was looking for an opening to fire at
my comrades in the jungle to my sat-
isfaction i saw him crumple up like a
limp rag and fall at the feet of his
amazed companions

  fine shot commented zadra non-
chalantly

  i was both pleased and gratified at
her attitude i had feared that she
might be startled and protest against mv
participation in the battle but as she
took the matter so philosophically i
prepared to repeat my performance
the natives however were not intend-
ing that i should

  after their first surprise at being at-
tacked from this new quarter had


cobra girl

passed they took cognizance of my pres-
ence in the temple and a rain of bul-
lets came hurtling through the window
and buried themselves in the ceiling
i had just time to drag zadra to the
floor and to take refuge myself behind
the casement

  when i ventured again to peer forth
i found the natives streaking across the
intervening space in the direction of
the temple only half a dozen still were
within the range of my pistol and by
the time i had got two of them the
others were safe

  and the men from the bonaventure
so far as i could see had not attempted
to come to my rescue had they not
heard my shot but of course they
could not know that it was i it seemed
indeed that i was doomed for the
aroused natives within two minutes
would be pouring into the temple and
overpower me by sheer force of num-
bers i had not reckoned however on
the courage and resourcefulness of
zadra

  wait here she cried let me
take care of them

  though i was in no mood to allow
the girl to fight my battle she beat me
in a race for the door thrust me aside
and bounded down the steps i was
close at her heels though and just in
time to see her halt the first native as
he was about to put foot in the temple

  she pushed him violently and as he
toppled over backward the others of
the party hesitated i could see that
they were in a quandary and one of
the leaders turned to the naib who was
in the rear

  it must have been that he ordered
them to advance as they began to move
forward slowly but with seeming reluc-
tance zadra now was berating them
excitedly in their own tongue which of
course i could not understand again
they came to a halt and engaged in a
brief colloquy

 shall i shoot i asked zadra
breathlessly

  no no no she cried

  then she said something to nana
who stood in the background and the
old woman began bringing the baskets
of snakes forward i had an inkling
now of zadras plan of defense but
if my suspicions were correct i wanted
to be out of the way when she put it
into effect to my own surprise i
found that i had no fear of bullets but
i had a horror of being bitten by one
of those terrible cobras

  while i was speculating thus the
naib of nagpur drew his forces about
him and began to harangue them in a
loud voice pointing in the meantime
in our direction

  i could fancy that he was exhorting
them to make a dash for us irrespec-
tive of the awe in which the ignorant
natives held the girl who guarded the
doorway and in the end he doubt-
less persuaded them to do his bidding
for they turned again toward the tem-
ple and began to advance though with
not any great alacrity

  we were in for it now i thought
and despite zadras caution not to shoot
i was prepared to empty the contents
of my automatic into the horde

  but there came a sudden diversion
that at the moment made it unneces-
sary for me to risk our position by driv-
ing the natives to further fury it was
an attack from the rear by the bona-
ventures men and several of the na-
tives went down at the first fire

  i saw them come pouring out of the
jungle shooting as they ran it was
a surprise to the naibs force and in-
stead of returning the fire in the open
they wheeled in a disorganized mass
and started for the protection of the
temple

  it was my cue then to inject myself
into the fighting which i did to the
best of my ability and i had the sat-
isfaction of seeing that many of my
cobra girl



shots went home and that the natives
halted for a moment undecided what
to do then at command of the naib
they made a stand and fired a volley at
their foes

  it was at this moment that zadra
took a hand in the game but in a man-
ner that was quite unexpected i would
not have been surprised at her method
had she stood in the door and repulsed
the natives when they tried to enter
but to rush forth to engage them was a
move that took me quite off my guard

  i was reloading my pistol when
zadra seizing one of the baskets of
snakes leaped down the garden path
and sprang into the melee i shouted
to her fearing that she might stop a
stray bullet but she gave no heed

  and though i raced after before i
could catch up she had thrown the
cover from her basket and was hurling
live snakes into the midst of the na-
tives at the same time screaming at
them in their own jargon

  before this onslaught the men were
dumfounded many threwr down their
arms and ran howling like frightened
children the naib too took to his
heels after one of the snakes writhed
past his ugly face only one-a big
sour-visaged fellow-ventured to meet
the attack he raised his gun as if to
shoot the girl but a bullet from my own
weapon suddenly altered his plan

  it was incredible indeed the rapid-
ity with which they vanished and with-
in the space of a minute we were in
undisputed possession of the field and
then in another moment we were sur-
rounded by the men from the bona-
venture i found myself the center of
my comrades and the target for a hun-
dred questions while at one side stood
zadra in the arms of her father pro-
fessor runyon

  it was at my suggestion that we re-
tired to the protection of the temple
for i had an idea that the naib might

rally his forces and begin shooting at
us from the protection of the palace

  zadra evidently had sung my praises
without stint to her father for the old
snake man really abashed me by the
thanks he showered on me for the
service that i had been to his daughter
and i must say that then i liked him
better than i had before perhaps this
though was because he was zadras
father

  the men generally were curious
about the girl and manners much to
my annoyance assumed an air of pro-
prietorship over her i suppose i was
jealous but at that time i did not ana-
lyze my feeling as jealousy

  i warned the men to give a wide
berth to the takra in which zadra had
imprisoned the snakes but old runyon
when he learned of the contents went
wild with delight

  fine fine he gloated rubbing his
hands and to my disgust he took one
of the filthy snakes from a basket and
fondled it as though it were a purring
kitten

  well take these beauties with us
he said to manners

  to manners protest the old fellow
reminded him that aside from their
value for experimental purposes the
snakes would bring a goodly sum from
zoological societies and museums in the
united states some of the men
finally volunteered to carry the laskets
when assured that they wrould be in
no danger from their venomous con-
tents

  and now back to the ship runyon
shouted gleefully ah he added in
a lower voice i had forgotten he
came over to zadra who was standing
by my side my dear my dear he
palpitated have you got it have you
got it i was so elated at finding you
that for the moment it slipped my
mind

it is here father she answered
and here also is your first analysis


cobra girl

  as a matter of courtesy i turned
away but meanwhile kept a curious
eye on father and daughter and i
confess i was surprised when i saw
zadra reach into her bosom and with-
draw a small vial half filled with a
colorless liquid a hypodermic syringe
and a slip of paper all of which she
handed to her father

  thank god my treasure my
treasure breathed the old man and
in an excess of joy he pressed the paper
and the vial to his lips

  so this was the treasure at last
but what a curious sort of treasure i
thought and what could it be that
was so valuable did the paper con-
tain a map that would lead to a buried
hoard of gold or jewels

  my cogitations were interrupted by
a command from manners who was
marshaling the men for the return to
the bonaventure

chapter ix

mystery

yye observed extreme caution in
leaving the temple lest the naib
and his men strike at us from an am-
buscade and made a quick dash for
the concealment of the jungle that
fringed the clearing our care seeified
unnecessary however as we saw noth-
ing of our enemies

  zadra when we reached the head of
the corduroy road that ran to the river
suggested that we take the subterranean
passage to avoid a possible clash in the
forest beyond but several of the men
whose love of a fight had not been sat-
isfied protested they were eager to
force the conflict and make an end to
the natives the professor however
ended the disagreement

  weve got what we came for boys
he said firmly and theres no use in
putting our necks in a halter my
chief object now is to get back to the
ship and quay as soon as possible

  those who would have continued the
fighting yielded of course and under
the direction of zadra we took to the
tunnel it was a dark dank place and
at every step i was in fear of treading
on a snake i wanted to walk beside
zadra too and i was raging when man-
ners took hold of her arm and elbowed
me out of the way

  finally we saw daylight ahead and
in a few minutes arrived at the river
and it was with a great deal of satis-
faction that i saw zadra safely aboard
the bonaventure and her baskets of
snakes stowed away in the hold

  i was thankful indeed that we had
escaped so luckily from our adventure
and i looked forward with infinite joy
to the long voyage back home during
which i should have the close compan-
ionship of the girl i had found in the
temple

  for the first few hours of our em-
barkation i was too busy in assisting
to warp the ship out into the channel to
give zadra any of my attention but
after our evening meal when the full
round moon flamed forth to guide us
as we slipped down the river i saw her
standing by the rail a dark statuesque
silhouette gazing pensively into the
jungle that lined our course

  i watched her from afar content to
stand there and admire her fearful to
disturb the privacy of her mind she
was a mystery to me-but there are
some mysteries that one does not like
to fathom they possess greater
charm while they still are mysteries

  i wondered if i should find zadra so
she seemed now to embody all the
witchery of untrammeled wilds-a
primitive woman-yet with the grace
and finish and education of one who
had been intimate with the fine things
of mans hewing

  she was a distinct paradox-cling-
ing yet self-reliant as she had proved
to me womanly to the highest degree
yet with a mans resourcefulness in time
cobra girl



of stress unrestrained as any jungle
creature yet in turn reserved digni-
fied cultured

  a strange spell seemed to come over
me as i watched her admired the
haughty poise of her superb head the
curve of her fine shoulders the con-
tour of the rounded arm that rested
on the rail indeed the body of her
was perfect but the mind of her was
the great problem

  i confess a curiosity concerning her
uncanny power over the cobras her
immunity to the bite of the serpents
i was puzzled by the little vial and the
slip of paper that she had handed to
her father in the temple

  but as i have inferred before to
know these things might destroy the
halo of illusion with which i had in-
vested her-for knowledge oft is a
bitter iconoclast that tears down and
smashes ones apotheosization of an
idol

  i was content then just to stand and
watch her at her thoughts but sud-
denly i was seized with a revulsion for
my own act i seemed to be doing
something that was mean and sneaking
i was prying with vulgar eyes into a
privacy that i had no honest right to
violate

  and then even as i thought of turn-
ing away i became obsessed with a mad
desire to rush forward and clasp the
graceful body in my rough bronzed
arms what was it this crazy impulse 

  it came to me with a start-the real-
ization of the emotion that i had been
trying to analyze i loved the girl
yes i loved her that was it and
i wanted to go to her at once and tell
her so but then with bitter revulsion
i hated myself i was the betrothed of
elsie vandman back in san francisco

  with what poignant heartache did i
comprehend the barrier that lay between
zadra and me it was an insuperable
barrier it seemed the spirit of ro-
mance that had been awakened within

me must die as it came silently without
expression i turned intending to at-
tempt to divert myself by a game of
cards with the men

  douglas oh douglas

  she saw me-was calling to me and
the call was a command that took me
swiftly to her side

  am i to understand that you were
passing me without even so much as
say good evening she demanded
with affected indignation and on
such a night as this

  i was abashed but the smile that she
gave me the frank hand with which
she gripped mine told me that she was
not actually offended

  i-i was passing hurriedly and did
not see you i lied apologetically

 what am i so insignificant
she made a pretty moue and transfixed
me with those wonderful eyes of hers

 n-no-not that i stammered
and i could feel my face flame beneath
the tan

  all right then ill forgive you she
laughed so you may tell me all about
the interesting men on the bonaventure
if i werent reassured by the presence
of you and father i should think i was
coursing the old spanish main with
a crew bent on piracy

  her conceit amused me and i lapsed
into biographical recital going as far
as my knowledge of the men would per-
mit and sometimes i fear a little
further

  we had stood there for half an hour
perhaps charmed with the beauty of
the night enjoying the wilderness of
nature spread about us interested only
in ourselves and the subject of our con-
versation when manners came along
he greeted zadra with unctuous polite-
ness and then turned brusquely to me

  mi think the captain has some work
for you farnworth-up front there
he said

  i dont believe the captain has any


cobra girl

work for me that i care to do i re-
plied just as brusquely

  i did not like manners tone nor did
i relish his intrusion

  i think i would go see if i were
you his voice was icy and his usu-
ady soft jovial face flamed with anger

  i prefer to think that i am not on
this ship in the capacity of a seaman
i flashed and besides i am having
a very pleasant conversation with miss
runyon

  i should like also to say something
to miss runyon began manners but
before he could go further she inter-
rupted

  indeed mr manners she said
freezingly mr famworth and i were
having a very enjoyable talk when you
interrupted

  i beg your pardon clipped man-
ners and swinging on one heel he went
aft

  i was at a loss to understand man-
ners in such a mood usually he was
too urbane too suave too diplomatic
to give the slightest offense

  i had noticed however thaf he had
been extremely cool with me since the
afternoon when we met in the temple
why i wondered what had i done
to offend him  i could think of noth-
ing however i was not worrying i
had become quite hardened by contact
with conditions more or less primitive
and felt perfectly well able to take care
of myself under all circumstances

  the intrusion of manners however
had cast a damper over both zadra and
me and after the conversation had
dragged in a desultory fashion for a
few minutes she bade me good night
i accompanied her to the door of her
stateroom-if the mall quarters that
she occupied might be dignified by such
a name-then filled my pipe and began
to stroll back along the deck about
midship i met ling he pressed a
finger to his lips to enjoin silence and
grasped me by the arm

  come see what old man do he
whispered

  runyon 

  so be say nothing

  i had noticed that a light was stream-
ing through a porthole in the profes-
sors cabin but it had not occurred to
me to spy on him now however my
curiosity having been aroused by ling
i crept up and peered inside

  look sibilated the chinaman
girl she come too

  yes zadra had just stepped through
the door that separated her quarters
from those of her father and more-
over i noticed on the floor half a
dozen of the snake baskets that we had
brought from the temple the old man
had taken these from the hold where
we had stowed them on our arrival

  but what was he doing that caused
you to bring me here i asked ling

  he choke snake when i see him
first

  choking a snake i repeated
why

  dont know maybe we see

  i saw zadra now go to one of the
baskets lift the lid boldly and thrust
a delicate hand inside she brought
forth a huge six-foot cobra and
straightened it out on the table that
her father used for his laboratory work

  the old man in the meantime had
provided himself with a goblet and ad-
vanced to the end of the table toward
which the snakes head lay i watched
them fascinated wondering what they
intended doing now my curiosity had
not long to wait

  zadra then began to prod the ser-
pent driving it into a frenzy of anger
in which it writhed and struggled in a
vain effort to turn on her but her
slender hands were firm and she was
quite the master of the situation

  suddenly professor runyons hand
shot forwardand with the mouth of the
goblet he struck the snake a sharp wow
on the nose zadra at the same in-
cobra girl



stant allowed the cobra to raise its
head under the guidance of her hand
swiftly unerringly it struck the gob-
let with which the old ophiologist was
tormenting it and into the glass spurted
a small portion of a viscid amberish
liquid-the venom of the cobra

  theyre taking the snakes poison
i whispered

  so be agreed my companion
ling no like

  nor do i i said come away
we turned and i saw a dark shadow
flit around a comer of the deck house
i could not make out who it was but
he too doubtless had been watching the
operation within

  i said good night to ling and went
to my berth and i lay for a long while
before sleep came to me wondering
why zadra and her father had ex-
tracted the venom of a cobra wonder-
ing who was the man who over our
shoulders also had watched them at
work wondering why manners had
attempted to pick a quarrel with me

  ah there were many things that puz-
zled me but at that time i could not
know that i was to face a greater
graver problem before matters were to
be explained it was well that i did not
know and that benign nature elected
to lull me into tranquil sleep

chapter x
a snakes venom

a week passed during which i en-
joyed thoroughly the companion-
ship of zadra even while i gained the
further scorn of manners for sev-
eral days he had not spoken to me nor
did i inquire into his coolness

  at first his attitude had vexed me
sorely but i had come to the conclu-
sion that it was caused by jealousy-re-
sentment of the close friendship that
existed between zadra and me

  it seemed strange too for him to
feel that way about a woman for i

never had known him to show interest
in any member of the sex however
that was the only explanation that i
could make to myself

  i was pained too by the uncontrol-
lable ever-growing love that i had for
zadra something about her seemed
verily to hypnotize me i was quite
her slave yet i dared not breathe a
word of love to her for back in san
francisco there was another waiting

  it was hard too-terribly hard to
walk with zadra about the deck to
linger at the rail under the light of the
moon to exchange sweet little confi-
dences with her and not to tell her of
the great consuming passion that
surged within me and i had reason
to believe that zadra would have wel-
comed a declaration of love from me

  i am not necessarily conceited but a
woman however modest may tell 
man of her heart in a thousand little
ways and without a spoken word make
him understand that he is the man it
was thus that i learned that zadra held
for me something more than a feeling
of conventional friendship

  one evening as usual after the eve-
ning meal we went for our stroll about
the deck as was my custom i ex-
tended an arm to zadra but to my
surprise she pretended not to see it
i put her action down as a little whim-
sicality made no comment and lighted
my pipe puffing silently as we made our
rounds twice i saw manners watch-
ing us but presently he joined runyon
in the latters improvised laboratory

  a pale lopsided moon came pres-
ently out of the horizon and zadra and
i took our accustomed place by the star-
board rail she still was silent and in
her great luminous eyes there was a
look of plaintive sadness that i could
not fathom finally when i could
stand it no longer i spoke

  has something gone wrong zadra
i asked softly

  she made no immediate answer but


cobra girl

turned her head slowly and pierced me
with those pained eyes of hers she
was breathing heavily as though under
the stress of some great emotion then

  i love you douglas she cried pas-
sionately i-oh r

  she seized me suddenly by the hands
and buried her face against my shoul-
der

  she was sobbing now and i could
feel her body tremble my first feel-
ing of surprised elation at her volun-
tary impulsive admission gave way
quickly to a dull throbbing ache and
a painful tightening of the heartstrings
for the pity of it all it was enough
for me to suffer but for her-oh it was
horrible

  and i love you too zadra dear
i whispered putting a tender arm

around her shoulder but-

  yes douglas i know she said
gently i shouldnt have spoken be-
cause-because it was unfair to-to the
other woman

  yes there is another woman i ad-
mitted dumbly god help us

  i knew who had told her about the
other woman it was manners there
was no one else aboard the bonaventure
who knew of my betrothal to miss
vandman

  forgive me douglas she
straightened up suddenly and tried to
smile through the tears that filled her
eyes i am bold unwomanly too im-
pulsive you should hate me

  you are nothing that you have
called yourself i protested and i
never could hate you-because i love
you

  and we have made misery for each
other she said but we are brave
people you and i

  yes we are brave people i agreed
but at the same time i wondered just
how brave we were there are those
whom chains cannot bind yet who may
be imprisoned by the slender strands
of loves weaving

  hi go to bed now she said
abruptly good night

  so soon i took her hand gently
and would have detained her

  good night douglas she repeated

  she was gone i watched her flit up
the deck like a gracile moonbeam and
then i saw another darker figure steal
from the shadows of the deck house
and enter the laboratory

  was it runyon or manners i could
not tell- whichever it was however
his object undoubtedly had been to
eavesdrop on zadra and me well it
was of no consequence with a heavy
heart i leaned far over the rail and
watched the harbor lights of singapore
winking in the distance

  i was in a curious fanciful mood-
awake yet dreaming for in every danc-
ing moon-splashed billow i saw the
face of zadra and in the soft soughing
of the breeze through the rigging i
could hear her words i love you
douglas v

  presently i grew weary of my lone-
some occupation and decided to turn
in i was not particularly sleepy but
once down i thought that the motion
of the ship might lull me into slumber
in any event i should try it

  i knocked the ashes from my pipe
and hastened to my cabin i still was
uneasy about the propinquity of the
professors snakes but as they had not
injured me so far i did my best to make
myself believe there yas no danger
however i never failed to look care-
fully under my bunk and into the cor-
ners before retiring

  having assured myself that there
were no snakes in my room i laughed
at my fears and flung myself down on
my bunk an hour probably passed
while i tossed from side to side unable
to sleep

  my mind was too keenly active in
attempting to digest the mysteries that
beset me in worrying over the condi-
tion that had engulfed zadra and me in
cobra girl



wondering what the outcome of it all
might be

  and then suddenly i was startled by
a light tap on my door i sprang from
bed and responded the visitor was
my friend ling

  me heap sick he announced plain-
tively pressing both hands to the pit
of his stomach maybe have a cramp
and besides me think one damn snake
come in my room

  a snake i cried areyou sure
  so be me see him crawl and then

  ling doubled up in another spasm of
pain and i hastened to fix him up a
strong dose of ginger then i led him
to my bunk and told him to sleep there
if he could it was more comfortable
than the one he occupied and from the
way i felt i didnt imagine that it would
be of any service to me in any event
i could crawl into the upper bunk if
i should become sleepy

  my simple remedy helped the patient
and leaving him resting easily i went
up to the deck i had no notion of go-
ing to lings quarters to look for snakes
that was a daylight job and better
suited any way to some one other than
myself

  so i gave lings quarters a wide
berth and went as far into the peak as
i could it was cool there and i would
not be disturbed i made myself com-
fortable on a coil of rope with my back
propped against the capstan and lighted
my pipe

  i will not attempt to conjecture how
long i sat there brooding the fact
remains that lulled by the cool breeze
and the solitude of boundless moonlit
waters i went to sleep nor do i know
how long i slept

  i was startled into awaking by an un-
toward commotion among the men i
saw at once that it wasnt a storm that
had aroused them perhaps the ship
was afire

  i sprang to my feet and hastened aft

to where a group was standing chatter-
ing loudly in half a dozen languages
on my approach a strange cry went up
and i noticed that several of them
shrank away from me as though i
were plague-stricken or a ghost

  whats the matter i demanded

  a man we called the don a wiry
dapper little spaniard began to laugh

  olsen here he said indicating a
giant norwegian just woke us all up
with the story that he had found you
dead in your bunk when he went to call
you for your trick on the watch what
kind of liquor you been drinking he
added turning to the puzzled scandi-
navian

  he laughed again uproariously and
was joined by many of the others

  perhaps he did find a dead man in
my bunk i said quietly naturally
he thought it was i

 what cried the don who

  poor ling he came to me ill a few
hours ago and i put him in my bunk
i wasnt sleepy then but while sitting
up in the bow on a coil of rope i
dropped off unexpectedly

  whats the row here suddenly de-
manded the querulous voice of profes-
sor runyon

  he was wearing pajamas and el-
bowed his way through the group mak-
ing directly for me his white hair
disheveled made him appear almost
ghastly in the moonlight his black
snapping snakelike eyes made him seem
almost a fearsome thing and intui-
tively i shrank backward i should
have felt the same had i been ap-
proached by one of the cobras which
were his playmates

  what is it he repeated authori-
tatively piercing me with those awful
eyes of his

  i explained the situation to him in as
few words as possible

  well he snarle what are you
standing here for maybe the man
isnt dead lets have a look at him


cobra girl

  i led the way eagerly but at the
door of my room i was inclined to hesi-
tate dumb nameless fear seized me
and i had to conquer it by sheer force
of will i could not afford to let the
others see that i was afraid so as
bravely as i was able to pretend i
scratched a match and lighted the lamp
on the wall

  no second glance was needed to as-
sure one that ling had gone to his
last sleep his body was contorted
swollen and his skin of a queer pur-
plish hue

   snake bite i cried in horror

  runyon nodded his head silently
and stepped to the side of the bunk

  theres one of those damned cobras
in the room look out  i warned

  the men scampered but runyon
turned on me with a snarl

  dont be a fool he snapped
come here

   reluctantly i stepped to his side

  look  he commanded the poor
fellow got it in the neck-right in the
jugular but while it was a cobras
venom that did the job it was not a
cobra that did the striking

  what i gasped what do you
mean 

  that if a cobra did strike the beg-
gar he had only one fang and that one
smaller than any i ever have seen in
a snakes mouth my dear fellow this
was done with a hypodermic syringe
what do you know about it

   wtiat do i know about it  i gasped
my god you dont think-

  im not thinking was the curt re-
joinder i am asking you a ques-
tion

  i was staggered at the mans impu-
tation horrified at the terrible fate that
had overtaken ling almost speechless
from the shock of the tragedy for ling
i had accountcd my best friend aboard
the ship however i collected my wits
and simultaneously i was obsessed
with a suspicion of the truth

  well demanded runyon impa-
tiently why dont you answer

  you remarked a moment ago i
replied icily that you were not think-
ing termit me to say that i am i
think that lings colic saved my life
i think that the poison that killed him
was intended for me

  i quite naturally was the center of
interest and many questions were put
to me but i was careful not to let
my exact suspicions be known the
men however became morose and
fearful of the snakes then a delega-
tion demanded that they be cast over-
board  but runyon refused

  the consternation of the crew may be
well imagined when one morning ol-
sen the big norwegian was found
dead in his bunk just as ling had been
found in this instance however there
were two incisions in his throat and it
was agreed that he actually had been
bitten by a cobra

  the same day one of the snakes was
found lying in the sun on the forecas-
tle hatch this gave further credence
to the belief that olsen had been at-
tacked by a snake while he slept and
in retaliation one of the men dis-
patched the reptile with a club

  this act drove the professor into a
frenzy of rage and had it not been for
his fear of arousing hrs discontented
crew to some deed of violence he would
have punished the man severely

  if the ships company were distrait
after the death of olsen it became mad
with fear and anger when the don
a popular spaniard a few days later
went the same way as ling and ol-
sen had died so died the don his
bloated blackened body was found in
his berth in the morning with those
two deadly pin points of scars in his
neck to show where the venom of a
snake had entered his veins

  but an immediate search for the ser-
pent that had struck the deathblow
failed to reveal one that was not con-
cobra girl



fined in the hold or in the professors
laboratory

  as a result of the dons death the
men held a conference in the forecas-
tle and a committee of which i was
chosen the head was named to wait on
the professor once more and ask that
all of the snakes on the ship be thrown
overboard but runyon as i had ex-
pected would not countenance the
proposition all of my arguments-the
disease of the men the possibility of a
mutiny the saving of other lives-were
in vain

  tell them to go to the devil fam-
worth was his parting declaration
and i delivered his message literally

  there were threats you may be sure
on all sides but i managed to stay the
rising storm

  thus we found ourselves in the mid-
pacific whei one morning de cosmos
another spaniard and heisler a
brawny german were found dead in
their berths-killed in the same way as
had been their comrades who had gone
before

  the circumstances were the same-
two tiny holes in their necks and no
evidence on the ship though thorough
search was made that a cobra had
gained its liberty

  i admit that then i had a horrible
suspicion i remembered a hypodermic
syringe that zadra had handed to her
father in the temple in addition to a
vial half filled with a colorless liquid
and a slip of paper and i remembered
the night when ling had called my at-
tention to proceedings in the professors
laboratory and i had seen him with the
assistance of zadra extracting the
venom of a cobra

  and the men had blamed the pro-
fessor for the previous deaths but
why-why  ah no the thing was too
horrible too inhuman to contemplate
for what could be his object 

  there is no doubt in my mind that
the men would have mutinied then
athhii

had it not been for a sudden interrup-
tion imposed by nature-one of those
quick violent brief storms that come
from nowhere but sweep the pacific
with demoniacal fury while they last
it left us a battered hulk our mainmast
gone limping lamely through a white
smother of water

  standing at the head of the compan-
ionway i noiiced that in falling the
mainmast had knocked the deck house
in which the professors quarters were
located askew i heard a scream from
that direction it was a mans cry-a
cry of terror

  the deck was slippery and the ship
still pitching dangerously neverthe-
less i determined to investigate some
one in the professors laboratory
needed assistance gauging well the
slant of the vessel i made a quick dash
along the port rail and gained the lab-
oratory in safety i turned the knob
of the door it was locked

  help for gods sake came a faint
call from within

  i could not recognize the voice but i
thought that it might be runyon in-
jured perhaps by the crashing of the
mast the door was frail and with
one heave of my shoulder i burst the
lock i would have rushed in at once
but a warning from the dim interior
deterred me

  careful there cautioned a man
whom i could not see

  no need to tell me to be careful for
at that moment i saw only too plainly
what had happened the tossing of
the storm-swept vessel had broken open
the cages in which the professor had
kept his cobras and the floor was alive
with the venomous creatures

  i shrank back intuitively but at the
same time whipped out my pistol and
began shooting one after the other
i spattered the hideous heads of the
snakes over the floor until i had emp-
tied my weapon


cobra girl

  that you douglas  came the voice
from within

  yes is that manners

  yes old man

  manners i hesitated in the process
of reloading half inclined to leave him
to his fate

  but my spirit of humanity prevailed
and with my pistol again charged i
began anew to pot snakes from my posi-
tion in the doorway in the midst of
my fusillade however i was startled
by an hysterical shriek

  manners i cried manners

  one of them got me at last came
faintly from within

  what is it douglas

  i turned to find zadra at my elbow

  see i explained the snakes have
escaped f one has bitten manners

  she commanded me to stand aside
and in a flash she was in the room
the next moment i saw a snake go
hurtling over the side of the ship and
into the water to be followed by others
in quick succession until fully a dozen
must have been cast into the sea zadra
certainly was clearing the laboratory
of its dangerous occupants in short
order

  all right douglas she called pres-
ently

  though still apprehensive i ventured
to enter i found zadra bending over
her father who was lying on his table
while manners sitting beside him was
making a tourniquet around one of his
own legs

  as i approached he whipped out a
knife and made a cross cut in the snake
bite that the poisoned blood might
escape more freely but i could see
that he was pale and weak already and
that the leg had begun to swell and
discolor such is the deadliness of the
cobras bite and the speed with which
its venom courses through the body

  the professor too had been bitten
and it puzzled me to know why the
poison did not seem to have the same

effect on him as it had on manners
his ankle was only slightly swollen
where the snakes fangs had entered
and he lay placidly in a semi-comatose
condition while zadra began filling him
with antidotes

  i of course performed the same
service for manners but within fifteen
minutes he was in the throes of a con-
vulsion

  it passed presently then he opened
his eyes over which a glassy film was
drawing rapidly and recognized me
he stretched out one hand imploringly
and i grasped it

  douglas he murmured im going
i am not sorry but-but before i go
theres something i must say to you
dont-dont let me die till then will
you

chapter xi

the secret revealed

nce you will remember i had
liked manners and had regarded
him as a friend and now his pitiable
plight awakened within me all of the
old feeling of attachment even as it
obliterated the rancor that had been
engendered by his strange treatment of
the last few weeks

  already in my mind i was finding
excuses for him perhaps his brain had
been turned by something of which i
knew nothing so with tender hands
i gave him a large drink of whisky
thanks old man he murmured
thats better and then it seemed
manners divined what was passing in
my thoughts no douglas he con-
tinued weakly theres no excuse for
me but you-you are a kind-hearted
chap and maybe you can forgive me
im bad old man-bad understand
there there i soothed dont
exert yourself save your strength
its no use he smiled wanly
no its no use in saving my strength

i want to use it in telling you how
wicked i have been-how i have hurt
cobra girl

i

you you remember that agreement i
showed you after we left frisco well
that was a forgery

  you never knew what a clever
forger i was i drugged you at that
dinner at the renaissance and shang-
haied you you didnt know that-and
you have no idea why i did it ill tell
you you see miss vandman-

  manners stopped and his eyes went
shut

  miss vandman i cried what
of miss vandman 

  but manners made me no answer
he was in the throws of another con-
vulsion again i poured a large dose
of whisky down his throat and pres-
ently he revived he was weaker now
though than he had been before the
poison was telling on him rapidly

  where was i he said suddenly
opening his glassy eyes i marveled at
the mans great vitality

  oh yes i was telling you about
miss vandman i knew of course
that you and she were to be married
and i knew just why you were old
friends but you didnt love each other
and-and then you remember count
lomville who came to frisco six
months ago he really fell in love with
miss vandman

  i think he loved her money too
anyway he made me a proposition
if i could get you out of the way so
that he might marry miss vandman he
would give me twenty-five thousand dol-
lars and i got you out of the way
old man

  but i did more i wrote miss vand-
man a letter purporting to come from
you to the effect that you did not care
to marry her and were leaving with
another woman the writing was like
yours because-well i told you that
i was a clever forger

  i was fairly staggered by the mans
story and the thought that such a vil-
lain had deceived me all these years
but can you blame me loving zadra as

i did when i say that i held no resent-
ment toward the dying man-in fact
was rather glad that he had done as he
did 

  and then i tried to hurt you with
zadra-miss runyon he went on
weakly i loved her myself douglas
-at sight i was furiously jealous of
her preference for you so i told her
that you were engaged to marry miss
vandman and then-then i tried to
kill you

  i am glad that ling was in your
berth that night i got the snakes venom
and the hypodermic from the old mans
laboratory and i-killed all the others
too you dont laugh well i had
arranged with all of these adventurers
when i engaged them for runyons ex-
pedition that if they should not re-
turn the money they were to receive
should revert to me

  so i killed them for that little bit
of money old man you see now what
a desperate person i have been and
that is how i have lived these many
years-by blood and at intervals i
would go to frisco to spend my gains
and to mingle with my intellectual
equals tell me what do you think
now that-

  the poor devil never finished his
body stiffened and his voice trailed
away in a throaty gurgle i stood there
appalled by his confession scarcely
realizing that he would speak no more
hardly knowing what to think and
then zadra came and laid a hand on my
arm

  has he gone she whispered

  i nodded my head and turned away

  and your father i questioned

  i think-i hope he will recover

  with my assistance she made him as
comfortable as possible in his berth
and then i strolled forth on the deck
the men in the meantime had cleared
away the debris that the storm had left
but it was determined not to attempt to
step the broken mainmast nor was it


cobra girl

at all necessary as we were bowling
along merrily under the propulsion of
our single screw

  i made no mention to any one ex-
cept zadra of the confession that man-
ners had made to me but somehow the
men seemed to divine that it had been
he who had caused the deaths of their
comrades

  this belief was strengthened of
course by the fact that there was no
more trouble aboard and that the re-
mainder of our voyage was as tranquil
as any that ever had been made by a
liner

  immediately on our return to san
francisco i telephoned to elsie vand-
man and was informed that she was on
a honeymoon tour around the world
with her husband count lomville

  if i had any regrets i found quick
solace in the arms of zadra and i may
remark that she was pleased by the
news that i brought her

  theres one thing that i am aching
to know i said one afternoon to the
most wonderful wife that a man ever
had  no there are several things dear
i want to know what was the treasure
that we sought in far-off india-you or
the slip of paper and the vial of color-
less liquid that you gave to your father
that day in the temple

  she laughed adorably and then she
bantered

  what do you think

  that you were the treasure-at least
my treasure

  your treasure of course but i
dont know she gazed pensively from
our window out over the bay the
real treasure of intrinsic worth was in
the vial and on the slip of paper the
first contained a serum that immunizes
one against the bite of a cobra-or any
other snake for that matter and the
other held the formula for its compo-
sition

  father got them from an old east
indian mystic and thought that a for-

tune lay in the manufacture and sale of
the serum then while we were at
madras he was compelled to go to cal-
cutta on business i went out into the
country on a visit to some english
friends and it was there that i met the
naib of nagpur

  he abducted me as i told you but
previously i had been immunizing my-
self hypodermically against snake bite
and the naib had his servants pack up
all of my belongings and bring them
with us so i still had what was left
of the serum as well as the formula

  i was lost to father entirely until
mr manners told him one day a story
of an american girl who was held by
the naib of nagpur and who could
handle the cobras without danger he
had not seen me of course but it seems
that the story spread through the coun-
try

  and father was afraid to call the
attention of the authorities to my con-
dition fearing that the naib was
powerful enough to make away with
me and cause them to believe that the
story was a mere fiction so he organ-
ized what mr manners picturesquely
called the mystery club-a band of
fearless adventurers and set out to find
me

  and thank god we did i inter-
posed heartily but tell me i added
how it was that with this wonderful
serum your father was affected at all
by the bite of the cobra

  he had not taken enough of it to
make him entirely immune that is
why he became so ill

  why then did he venture to handle
a cobra  why did he bring those nasty
snakes on board the bonaventure

  he needed them because their ve-
nom is one of the ingredients of the
serum

  so now it all was clear i prefer
to call this a treasure story for i found
my treasure and professor runyon
gained his ergo both of us are happy

speakin of spirits and the angels
at mons and all them kind of
things i dont believe in none of
it the mail carrier said

  no one had mentioned spirits or the
angels at mons and i sat up suddenly
for i was at that minute trying to read
by the flickering light of the one lamp
in the station waiting room an article
on the great revival of interest in
spiritualism that the war has occasioned

  strange that you mentioned that
now the agent said in a husky dis-
gruntled voice for he was suffering
from la grippe that had settled in his
throat and his mental outlook on life

  he was half lying on his desk in the
infter office and without raising his
head from his arms he mumbled one
of the fellows was telling me to-day
that simpson left because this station
is haunted

  tve heard that yam the mail
carrier replied with evident disgust and
he projected a great wfad of tobacco
toward a cuspidor that stood to the
right of the stove surrounded by the
well intentioned but overreaching or
too weak efforts of a careless public
but if it had been haunted id have

  seen somethingof it for ive been here
every night for five years there may
be spirits in the world i dont say there
aint but when a fellow begins to tell
me he has been seein signs and gettin
messages i asks him what hes been
eatin and drinkin its whats inside
i says not outside that is makin the
trouble

  simpson didnt drink too much the
agent mumbled

  naw the mail carrier agreed as he
pushed the mail bags out of his way
with the toe of his boot and tilted his
chair back until he could raise his feet
to the ledge around the center of the
stove simpson was city bred that
was what was the matter with him he
got lonesome he imagined the wind
in the telegraph wires was voices and
just ordinary silence was to him a
terrible hush when there was a bliz-
zard ragin on the prairie the way there
is to-night and the wires got down both
goin and cornin he began to think how
far he was from home and friends and
got panicky and when you get that
way you can see and hear things as
never was

  the agent shoved back his chair and


when wires are down

  it made a screeching sound on the floor
of the inner office he buttoned his
gray sweater around him put on his
coat and fastened it up close to his
throat put on his cap and pulled it down
over his ears and came out into the
general waiting room

  he stopped a minute at the stove
that looked like a tippler who is so far
gone he does not care for his personal
appearance it was dribbled with ashes
all the way down its neglected front
its top and bottom showed some signs
of having once been black but its belly
was a faded gray with a faint reddish
glow in one spot in the back that
showed there was some life within

  the agent extended his hands over
the stove and shivered slightly as those
do affected with la grippe then
he reached for the coal scuttle that was
half full of coal it had a small shovel
in it and with the shovel he opened
the stove door then stooped down to
the scuttle and made a great rattling
among the coal trying to fill the shovel
and carry it full to the stove but much
of it fell back and much dribbled on to
the floor and scattered in all directions
i noticed two pieces that rolled until
they hit a door back of the stove a door
that gave back a hollow sound

  the agent was too ill to gather them
up he slammed the stove door shut
with the shovel and when it did not
catch being clogged with ashes he
kicked it with the sole of his boot until
it did then he went to the door lead-
ing to the platform and opened it care-
fully but the storm that was raging
outside came through with such force
that it knocked him back and took away
his breath

  he tugged at the door to get it closed
after him but it was not until the mail
carrier got up and put his shoulder to
it that the catch finally caught and
stayed

  i was sitting on a bench beside the
wall on the same side as the station

  platform door and i noticed how the
tables and calendars and exhibition an-
nouncements on the walls rattled and
swung backward and forward

  a big calendar of a harvester com-
pany on the back of the door on the op-
posite side of the room from me blew
down and i got up and picked it up and
hung it back on the door

  i noticed as i did so that stripping
had at some time been nailed around
the door to keep out the wind but it
looked dusty and settled like a door
that is not used

  after hanging the calendar back on
its nail i returned to my seat the agent
came in and after another fight with
the wind succeeded in shutting the
door with a bang that sent such a gust
of air through the room that again the
calendars and time-tables rattled and
the light in the one lamp that was in
a bracket near the ticket wicket
bounded out of the top of the chimney
and went out in a burst of smoke

  we were not in complete darkness
for there was a slight glow from the
stove and the ticket wicket and the
door into the inner office were both
open and the light in there while it
danced and flickered did not go out

  the mail carrier got up and reached
for the lamp in the bracket while with
his other hand he struck a match on
the seat of his trousers the agent
went on into the inner office

  any sign of her i asked him
the train was already three hours late
and it was almost midnight

  not a sign he said and its a
terrible night-like hell let loose-i pity
any one who is out to-night

  it was just such a night as this that
a woman out in the country was frozen
to death the mail carrier said

  not desiring to hear any tales of
horror such as are popular among the
people who do the waiting work of the
world i got up and went to the wicket
when wires are down



and asked can you find out where she
is has she left brandon yet

  cant tell you a thing about her
he said the wires are down she
may be canceled

  its a bad time of year to be travel-
ing the mail carrier continued last
week simpson and a traveler like your-
self sir and i waited here until four
oclock in the morning and then the
traveler gave up and went back to the
hotel and didnt she come through at
four-thirty and it was important for
him to get to winnipeg that night too
he waited for me to ask a question
but when i didnt he continued he
was a detective working on the mor-
rison case-that was the one i men-
tioned-it was mrs morrison who was
frozen to death

  oh i said how was that i
found myself sitting up rather straight

  i guess you saw it in the papers-
you did if you belong in these parts
he waited for me to enlighten him but
when i didnt he asked you dont
belong here do you

  no i answered

  just came in at noon didnt you
he continued with the curiosity of one
whose chief interest in life is the casual
traveler who is rather rare at such
little stations as oakhom in the middle
of a northern winter

   yes i said

  ever been here before he asked
with frank curiosity

  no i said never before
morrison was a farmer he con-
tinued returning to his story i lived
on his homestead about ten miles from
here i didnt know him-nobody knew
much about him-he lived pretty much
to himself some people said morrison
wasnt his name he was hidin i dont
know but he disappeared three weeks
ago and nothin has been seen or heard
of him since

  he has likely gone to visit friends

or to see the world i said no doubt
hell turn up before spring

  id say that too if there hadnt been
somethin mysterious about his disap-
pearance he explained

  he was still holding the lamp in his
hand but he turned to put it up in the
bracket and as i watched him i was
conscious of something moving behind
him

  i peered into the shadows with some
surprise for i thought there were only
the three of us in the station waiting
room and i had not seen a cat or dog
or anything else alive and no one could
come in from outside without an accom-
paniment of wind and snow

  the mail carrier returned to his seat
and i saw that it was the calendar i jiad
hung on the door opposite that i had
seen moving it was swaying forward
as if impelled by a gentle but constant
wind

  i recalled that as i had felt up and
down the door to find the nail on which
to hang the calendar i had thought it
seemed more solid than the usual soft-
wood doors in such places

  what is there mysterious about a
man going away for a few weeks in
the middle of the winter i asked
absently my eyes still on the calendar

  morrison did his business and got
his mail at a small town on the other
line the mail carrier continued but
six weeks ago he came over here and
left a sealed envelope with the lawyer
he would not explain anything but he
told the lawyer that he would report
to him every monday and if he missed
a monday the lawyer was to open the
envelope and follow the instructions
given inside the lawyer thought him
a bit queer but promised to do as he
wished

  sounds mysterious i said when
he paused for effect

  he paused so long that i noticed how
the elements were tearing at the little
station house it was like some wild


when wires are dcwn

beast worrying it until it creaked and
groaned in protest-and all the while
the wind was playing some wild dirge
on the frosty wires-something that did
not seem of earth or things human

  a bad night the mail carrier said
as the wind beat against the window
but that night was worse the night she
was frozen to death but i was speak-
ing about morrison he called to see
the lawyer for three mondays then
he missed the lawyer opened the
envelope

  the agent got up and came into the
general waiting room and stood beside
the stove he was a newcomer and
he had evidently not heard the story

  morrison stated that his life was in
danger and that a search was to be
started for him at once he said they
were to look for him and a man who
wore a gold ring with a peculiar crest
on it he gave a rough sketch of the
crest it was heart-shaped with two
crossed keys in the center

  was there no clew to his disappear-
ance 

  no and yes the mail carrier an-
swered ponderously when morrison
came to the farm his wife was with him
-a young bit of a girl who didnt know
any more about a farm than i do about
a machine gun and not as much i
guess the neighbors said she was
much above him-educated and accom-
plished and all that-and he was
ignorant and coarse i dont know why
no one does but he and his wife did
not seem to get along from the first
and it was on a night like this that she
started for a neighbors in her night
clothes she was frozen to death of
course he said she walked in her sleep
-no one will ever know

  i felt my hands twitching-closing
and unclosing spasmodically-it was
such a terrible night for a young bit
of a girl all alone on the prairie

  a strange story i said

  yes he agreed and paused again

like one who has yet more startling
things to tell

  yes and the neighbors say his wife
had a gold ring with a heart-shaped
crest with two crossed keys in the
center

  what is their explanation

  some say they belonged to a secret
society maybe spies hidin some say
she belonged to a titled family and ran
away with him and some say she
wasnt his wife that she was married to
another man but-he paused-its all
gossip nobody knows

  i pulled my cap down over my eyes
and picked up my gloves that were on
the seat beside me and put the one on
my left hand-then i glanced around in
a casual way to see if the others were
watching me

  i suddenly sat bolt upright my eyes
almost popping out of my head for on
the bench on the opposite side of the
room a man evidently a farmer sat
huddled up his legs drawn in under
the seat his arms hanging stiffly down
at his side his whole appearance that
of a man too ill to care for anything

  he wore a sheepskin coat a non-
descript cap of some kind and a muffler
around the upturned collar of his coat
his cap was drawn down over his ears
and forehead until only his eyes were
visible-and there was something
grotesque in his appearance-caused i
decided by a projecting end of his muf-
fler that stuck up back of his head like
a cord to hang a picture or a statue

  the mail carrier was still talking to
me and when i did not answer he
looked at me and then his eyes followed
the direction of mine his feet and his
chair came to the floor suddenly with
a bang

  by gosh how did you get in i
didnt hear you

  the stranger did not answer but
seemed to sag down like one too utterly
weary to bother

  la grippe the mail carrier asked
when wires are down



sympathetically after a pause when
the stranger did not move or speak

  the agent beckoned me to go into
the inner office

  when did he come in he asked
in a low voice when we were beside his
desk

  i dont know i said i had no idea
any one had come in until i saw him
sitting there

  he didnt come through that door
he said and nodded toward the door
leading to the station platform no
one can come in that way to-night with-
out creating a commotion

  he must have come through that
door i said and nodded toward a door
in the inner office

  no he didnt the agent said de-
cidedly i locked that door when i
brought in the coal tramps might
get in and set fire to the place

  he evidently wanted me to believe
that it was not fear that made him
lock the door

  there is another door into the wait-
ing room i said and looked toward
the door on which i had hung the cal-
endar

  he must have come in that way
the agent agreed ill see that it is
locked no one else will come through
there while im here

  he went out and tried the door

  it resisted

  there was a key in the lock and he
tried to turn it he looked over at
em and said it is locked

  he came back into the inner office
he must have locked it when he came
in but hell get out before i leave to-
night this is not going to be a hotel
for tramps

  i could see that the stranger was get-
ting on his nerves for no one would
turn a man out on such a night

  the mail carrier had been watching
us but when i returned to my seat in
the outer office he turned to the
stranger again and said la grippe

  the man appeared to nod in affirma-
tion but the mail carrier had not fitted
the lamp properly into the bracket and
the flame was turned against the side
of the chimney which was already
black and smoked and i could not be
sure that the stranger had moved

  i know what la grippe is the mail
carrier continued and then paused

  everything was suddenly as still as
on the calmest summer day prairie
dwellers all know those pauses that
come in even the worst storms when
the elements seem to take a second or
two to get their breath only to come
back in renewed fury

  wre waited to hear again the whistle
and scream of the wind but instead we
heard the soft distant tones of a pipe
organ it was on the other side of the
door opposite me-the door on which i
had hung the calendar-at first low
then gaining in power and volume as
it seemed to approach until it seemed
that we were beside it and we recog-
nized the grand but solemn music of the
dead march

  the agent who was still in the inner
office came to the wicket and looked
out at us the mail carrier sat up very
straight with a plug of black tobacco
from which he had been taking chews
all night halfway to his mouth and i
rose to my feet but the man in the cor-
ner did not move i looked to see if
he had noticed it and i felt suddenly
that there was something familiar
about him

  by gosh it sounded like an organ
the mail carrier said when the wind
came again in a rush and tore at the
building snarling as a dog snarls
when it shakes a rat

  it sounded like the dead march to
me the agent said and returned to his
chair

  there isnt a pipe organ within two
hundred miles and not an organ of any
kind nearer than the village and thats


when wires are down

half a mile away and you couldnt hear
it fifty yards the mail carrier declared

  something made me look again to-
ward the calendar i had hung on the
door opposite it was doubtless the
fact that it was still blowing forward

  what is on the other side of that
door i asked the mail carrier

  that is a freight shed but it has
never been used it has never been
needed so it was nailed up

  it must be a drafty place i said
look at the way that calendar is blow-
ing

  he looked at it for a few seconds
steadily-then looked away-like one
who distrusts his eyes then back again

  i noticed that the calendar made a
still greater angle with the door

  the mail carrier got up deliberately
and went to the door opposite and felt
under and around the calendar he
felt up and down the cracks where the
stripping had been nailed and then he
shook his head

  he pushed the calendar back against
the door with his hand but wheri he re-
leased it it returned to its former posi-
tion

  by gosh he said and he stood
back and looked at it

  something in his tone brought the
agent to his feet he came to the door
of his office which was quite near the
door on which the calendar hung

  what is it he asked

  look at that calendar

  there must be a terrific wind
through that place the agent said
after looking at it

  come and feel the mail carrier
suggested

  the agent reached out and felt under
the calendar and up and down and
around it-then he looked at the mail
carrier-and then they both turned and
looked at me

i went over and felt around the door
as they had done but as i expected

i could not feel the slightest draft the
door seemed singularly solid

  i swan the agent ejaculated

  by gosh the mail carrier said
again

  i did not say anything but nodded
toward the calendar that had again de-
fied all laws of gravity-and was hang-
ing in a horizontal position making two
right angles with the door

  i went to it put my two hands on it
and pushed it down

  it yielded as a feather bed yields
but returned to its horizontal position
when i removed my hands

  the place is haunted the agent
said and glanced toward the huddled
figure in the corner but the man ap-
peared to be too ill to care even for
ghosts

  i could see his eyes and they were
fixed and starey like the eyes of one
who is very ill or asleep with but half-
shut eyes i wondered what it was
about him that made him seem vaguely
familiar

  ive been here every night for five
years the mail carrier said skeptically
and if this place is haunted id know
something about it

  he went to the door took the cal-
endar from the nail and put it on the
floor it lay where it was put like an
ordinary calendar

  the agent took a calendar from the
door leading into his office and hung
it on the door of the freight shed it
remained still a second then began to
rise

  its electricity the mail carrier
said its electricity and there is-

  he stopped suddenly for again there
was the peculiar hush that had pre-
ceded the organ music it may have
been that our nerves were unstrung
but it seemed to me to be a more in-
tense hush than the usual lull in a storm
arid also that there was something ex-
pectant and ominous about it

  instinctively i stepped forward and
when wires are down



stood between the agent and the mail
carrier and closer to them

  we stood facing the door leading into
the freight shed and i shivered when i
saw the calendar sink slowly back into
a normal position and icy fingers
seemed to play up and down my spine

  again it began at a distance on the
other side of the door on the far side
of the unused freight shed

  it sounded at first like some one
shoveling coal but the coal scuttle
was still beside the stove with the
shovel in it

  soon it seemed that some one was
dumping a whole load of coal on the
other side of the door-and we could
hear the odd pieces rolling quite up to
the other side of the door until it
seemed that the ones the agent had
dropped on our side had just come
through

  then there was a great crash as if
a whole carload of coal had suddenly
been backed up against the shed and
was all being dumped at once on the
other side of the door

  we shrank back at the onrush of the
great mass that we knew the door
could not withstand on it came like
thunder and hurled itself against the
freight-shed door

  the door did not yield-the calendar
did not even tremble-we felt no phys-
ical shock from the impact and the
wind was again whistling and sighing
and tearing at the desolate little station
house

  my god what is it i asked i
am not a coward but it was getting on
my nerves i could see that the other
two men were also badly shaken up

  the huddled figure in the corner had
not moved but instead of being a com-
fort to us for there is always comfort
in numbers at such a time the man
with the grotesque handle at the back
of his neck his queer starey eyes and
general air of illness and remoteness
added to our discomfort

  they say these things go in threes
the agent said and i could see even in
the wavering light that he was very
pale

  i dont believe it the mail carrier
said but his tone did not carry conr
viction

  it is the third day of the third
month of the third year of the war
i said thinking out all the threes i
could as i went along

  it is the third day of this storm
the third train that has been so late
and the third time three of us have
waited here nearly all night the mail
carrier said then added with a zest
for the gruesome the third month
since morrisons wife was frozen to
death and the third week since he dis-
appeared

  i glanced toward the huddled figure
in the corner when he spoke of three
of us waiting for the train

  he might as well not be there for
all the good he is he said in an un-
dertone he seems half asleep all the
time

  we stood around the stove a few
minutes in silence it was the mail
carrier who spoke

  i am going to open that door he
said some one has been dumping a
carload of coal

  but there is no coal here the agent
said i would know if there was
any coal at this station

  it must have been here before you
came or just came in to-night or some-
thing the mail carrier insisted and
went toward the door

  i instinctively put out my hand to
stop him and i saw the agent do the
same but we did not care to be thought
cowards so we said nothing

  he went to the door

  it seemed to me that he stepped more
firmly and heavily than necessary

  he did not hesitate but turned the
knob and pulled

  i confess that every separate hair on


when wires are down

my head and body seemed to have come
to life and was standing at attention
and i was not sorry when the door re-
sisted

  the key was in the lock and the mail
carrier turned it the lock went back
with a dull thud i shivered and i no-
ticed that the agent was standing very
tense

  the mail carrier pulled on the door
again-he jerked it-but it still re-
sisted

  it is nailed up on the other side
he said and looked back over his shoul-
der at us

  there was a queer hollow chuckle-
not human-not like anything we had
ever heard-we all looked toward the
man in the corner but he had not
moved again i felt the irritation of
something familiar about him that i
could not account for

   what are you chuckling about  the
mail carrier demanded and advanced
toward him why dont you get up
and help find out what is making the
trouble if you know so much about it

  the mail carriers nerves were begin-
ning to feel the strain

  i do not know what he would have
done to the huddled figure in the cor-
ner if at that second the terrible hush
had not come upon us a third time

  if you have ever waited at a death-
bed in the stillness of the night-alone
with the soul that is getting ready for
flight-you know something of how we
felt our bodies were tense our faces
white and strained and i recalled after-
ward how the eyes of the mail carrier
and the agent stood almost out of their
sockets

  the silence lasted so long that i
thought i would scream-that i must
do something to break the spell-when
on the far side of the shed on the other
side of the door we heard footsteps

  there could be no doubt about it-
they were stealthy stealing menacing

steps and they were coming toward the
door behind which we stood

  we were held like people in a night-
mare who feel the approach of some-
thing more than human intelligence can
bear

  the steps stopped-we listened-
they came stealing on again nearer and
nearer

  across the big freight shed we heard
them approaching closer and closer
until they were just on the other side
of the door-and then they stopped

  the hush continued and then  saw
the knob of the door turn i made a
queer sound in my throat

  the door began to open as stealthily
as the knob had been turned-slowly
and silently

  i sprang toward it

  hold it hold it i screamed or
i think i screamed the others said i
made no sound but they sprang with
me

  wre put all our strength against it
we pushed and strained

   it opened as resistlessly as the raging
storm outside we were shoved back
slowly steadily silently

  inch by inch the door opened and
inch by inch we yielded

   at last it was open and we saw thick
dust undisturbed on the floor-cobwebs
hanging from rafters and walls noth-
ing human had crossed the threshold
of that door for months possibly years

  it was the mail carrier who went
into the inner office and brought out a
trainmans lantern one with a strong
reflector that threw a clear light ahead

   i stood at his right the agent at his
left as he turned the light of the lan-
tern into the freight shed

  i do not know who made a queer
gurgling sound or groaned or gasped
but all those sounds were made as the
light of the lantern fell on a queer hud-
dled-up figure in a sheepskin coat with
its legs bent under it its arms hanging
down stiffly at its sides its cap drawn
when wires are down



down over its ears and forehead until
only its eyes starey and fixed were
visible and the projecting end of some-
thing stuck up back of its head like a
cord to hang a picture or statue

  my eyes followed the projecting end
of the cord up and up and from the
low rafter above there dangled the
other end of a cord

  as one man we turned and looked
into the comer where the stranger was
sitting

  he was not there

  we looked around the room there
was no one in the waiting room but the
mail carrier the station agent and my-
self

  it was the agent who with a panting
sound caught the door and slammed it
shut

  it was the mail carrier who fumbled
at the key until he turned it and the
lock went back into place with a dull
thud

  i saw that their faces looked like the
faces of men who have seen things for
which men have no words

  i do not know how long we stood
there the wind tearing at the building
the snow beating against the windows
the telegraph wires shrieking and
moaning and groaning in protest against
something they did not understand-it
seemed an eternity but it was not yet
one oclock when there was a shuffling
sound on the station platform the door
was opened and a man in a long coon-
skin coat entered

  he struggled with the door and
finally succeeded in getting it shut then
he looked at us

  why whats the matter  has
anything happened he asked

  no one answered him

  you all look as if you had seen a
ghost he said

  we have weve been spending the
night with one the mail carrier said

  you talking about ghosts the man

laughed well begin to think the
place is haunted if you talk like that
dont laugh doctor the mail car-
rier said solemnly its in there
he nodded toward the shed but it
spent the night on that bench and he
pointed to the corner where it had been

  what are you talking about the
man called the doctor asked

  look in there and see the mail
carrier answered and handed him the
lantern

  we all stood back of him-we did
not wish to look in again-but we knew
we would

  the doctor took the lantern and
opened the door which yielded readily
to him and looked into the freight
shed

  my god he gasped when his eyes
fell on the thing its a man

  he looked intently at it without
stepping over the threshold of the door
for a long time then he turned toward
us and said its morrison thats
who it is its morrison

  he looked again still without step-
ping over the threshold of the door
and twisted the lantern to get different
views he turned toward us again

  yes its morrison looks like a
case of suicide i guess the poor devil
was a bit off his balance the loss of
his wife and all that that letter about
being threatened by a person with a
peculiar ring sounded queer no one
with a crest has been in these parts

  he closed the door carefully locked
it and put the key in his pocket fll
get the coroner in the morning

  that doesnt explain how he came
to be sitting in that corner all night
the mail carrier said and pointed to-
ward the corner

  youve been eating something that
disagreed with you the doctor an-
swered good-naturedly

  we havent all been eatin some-
thin that disagreed with us the mail
when wires are down

carrier insisted and we all saw it
didnt we

  we corroborated his statement but
the agent was new to the place and i
was a stranger just there for a day

  then i guess youve all been drink-
ing the same thing the doctor said
skeptically he looked at me sharply
and asked you were asking for mor-
rison to-day

  yes i came out to see him on busi-
ness i replied

  didnt you recognize him to-night
he asked

  no it is some years since i saw
him and he had changed

   yes he had the doctor said remin-
iscently i remember him when he
came he looked a lot younger did
he owe you anything

  no i owed him something but i
and he has canceled the debt

  at that minute we heard the long-
delayed train

   i took my grip and got on board

   fortunately i had reserved a berth in
the pullman-but i got on the day
coach and sat there until the train
started

  then i took my grips and started
back through the train but when i
reached the platform of the day coach
i put down my grips and removed my
gloves

  from the little finger of my left
hand i drew a ring which i took be-
tween the finger and thumb of my right
hand and threw as far as i could out
into the ice and snow-somewhere be-
tween oakhom and winnipeg

  it was a gold ring with a heart-
shaped crest and crossed keys in the
center

  i went into the pullman and put my
grips in my berth but i did not feel
like sleep so i went to the smoking
room to my surprise i found it occu-
pied by a soldier

  he told me that he had been at the
front for two years

  what do you think of that story
about the angels at mons i asked

   i cant exactly say he replied with
a tightening up of reserve although
i was in that battle

  were there angels there

   i didnt see any

   i am particularly interested i ex-
plained because i had a peculiar ex-
perience to-day i went out to oak-
hom to find a man who did me a great
injury wrhen i got there i heard he
had disappeared in a mysterious way
i did not pay any attention to the mys-
terious part of it for i thought he had
heard i was on the way and knew it
was safer for him to get out i felt
certain that he would not return until i
was at a safe distance so after making
arrangements with the lawyer to let me
know if they heard anything about him
i went to the station to wait for the
train

  i paused and the soldier said
well

  i told him what had happened he
listened without comment

   when i finished we sat in silence for
a while the train had stopped the
light flickered in the one lamp in the
smoking room and we could hear the
storm beating and tearing at the train

   i have lived on these prairies twenty
years he said and things i couldnt
explain have happened but i dont
think there is any mystery about what
happened to you to-night

  how would you explain it i
asked

  farmers all look pretty much alike

when wearing those sheepskin coats
with their caps pulled down over their
eyes there is an epidemic of la grippe
in the district and i think that was a
farmer who was too sick to be bothered
talking

  how did he get in

  he could have come in during a
pause in the storm-you know it is
perfectly calm at such times-and your
when wires are down



attention was concentrated on the mail
carriers story and doubtless he went
out in disgust while you were watching
that door

  but the music the coal and the
stealthy steps

  listen he said

  i listened

  it seemed that i could hear queer

sounds almost like human moans
around the train

  a fellow imagines a lot the sol-
dier said

  yes i agreed perhaps you are
right

 what is your explanation he
asked

  i havent any i said

he got away with it

by e b whiting

for years he had been doing it

for years he had been bringing home rocks and stones in his pockets
he could not afford an auto how else can i get them home he always
answered when chaffed or chided by his wife for his self-styled hypochondriacal
hobby

    the sea is washing away my land why should i not do what lies in
my power to stop the sea

    his wife tried every means to reason him out of his to her ridiculous
hobby yet with the passing of the years it had become a fixed habit of his to
search eagerly along the jath or even along the sidewalk or street for silicon
dioxide as he persisted in calling the pebbles of any size up to the limit of his
pockets furtively he stooped to pick them up and furtively he slipped them
into the pocket where they would attract the least attention

    night after night he would greet his wife with a kiss and the inevitable
remark see what lovely quartz i have brought you and once in a long while
he would add it will last long years after we are both gone and forgotten
in his own mind he was satisfied that he was doing his bit however puny and
ineffective to hold the sea at bay

    years passed the age-long conflict became for this man a draw the
erosion and the rebuilding of the land just about kept pace with each other
pebbles persistently purloined from the citys streets came in handy as filling
among the larger rocks the man could bring by boat now and then of a calm
summer sunday afternoon

     but the sea was patient

    the wife often shuddered in secret better let the sea wash the land all
away than to become a confirmed hypochondriac for the sake of a few miserable
pebbles and then came the night when she waited in vain

    a crowded trolley car a broken brake bar an open drawbridge a
waiting wife a few escaped through broken windows and swam the icy waters
to safety her husband was a good strong swimmer but the pebbles the heavy
pebbles in his pockets for the moment she forgot them--

    the sea had won
tod elobbiivs

i am sitting before the window sum-
mer is dead and nature has buried
her with leaves the trees stretch
out their naked limbs like beggar chil-
dren asking alms the pale moon sur-
rounded by clouds resembles the face
of a man who has perished in the snow
now a cold breeze comes moaning
through the forest there is no warmth
left in the bosom of the sea

  the white silence of frost rests over
the face of the sleeping earth except
for the melancholy murmur of the
wind there is nothing to be heard the
moonlight is flowing steadily like a pale
silver river through a rift in the clouds
beneath the trees fantastic shadows
move about keeping time to the solemn
swaying of the branches overhead

  there is a little clearing in the center
of the forest and in the middle of this
clearing stands a house for many
years it has been deserted now it is
crumbling into decay it is aging fast
bke an old man who has no one left to
lovfe the country people fear to pass
it after nightfall they think it is
haunted by the ghost of a man who was
murdered there years ago

  once two brothers lived in this house

one winter night they quarreled a
week later when some of their neigh-
bors broke down the door a headless
corpse was found lying near the fire-
place    the murderer was never
found

  i think that i shall visit the house by
moonlight there is something about
this deserted ruin which attracts me
even in the broad daylight its broken
windows have what might be called a
strange expression there is something
odd about its thatched roof yes i
must certainly see it by moonlight

  last night i visited the haunted
house rising i dressed quietly so as
not to disturb my host and walked out
into the night

  stealing across the lawn where the
frost lay like a fine white veil i soon
found myself in the shadowy forest
above my head through interlacing
branches the moon peered at me from
the corner of a cloud beneath my feet
the fallen leaves were wet and sparkling
with tiny drops of water

  following a winding path i soon
reached the outskirts of a little clear-
ing there stood the deserted house
like a creature at bay surrounded by
fragments

an army of dark silent tree trunks as
i stepped out of the wood the moon
shook off her veil of clouds and ap-
peared in all her wonted brilliancy

  the haunted house looked even more
dilapidated than when i had seen it
last the roof had partly fallen in as
though beneath the weight of a heavy
blow the door stood ajar resembling
a sagging lower lip and the windows
were like black empty eye sockets

  as i stood in the clearing looking at
the haunted house suddenly a light
flashed up in one of the deserted rooms
a light which made the hovel resemble
a gigantic moldy pumpkin cut in the
likeness of a human head it was as
though a skull had suddenly regained
its eyes

  mastering up all my courage i ap-
proached the house cautiously the
dying grass made no sound beneath my

feet the wind from the sea had died
away and the moon as though in fright
had darted behind a cloud soon i
reached one of the windows i peered
in and this is what i saw

 the room was small and bare
faded paper like strips of dead dis-
colored skin hung from the walls in
one place a large piece of plaster had
fallen to the floor there was a small
wooden table in the center of the room
sitting in a dilapidated chair before this
table was an old man his head rested
on his arms his arms rested on the
table near him two candles flickered
in their sockets they threw their
light over the white hair the bent back
the wrinkled hands the shoulders of
the old man shook convulsively bright
drops glistened on his beard like hail
on frozen snow he was weeping bit-
terly

 lifes last song

by arnold tyson

yjthat would you do if i made love to you

      would you make me a slave to bow before
the shadow that i found beyond the door
where each love stood a while and then passed
through 

would you be weary when at last you knew
that all loves have their day and not one more
would you beat at my window when the roar
of loves flame settled to a sickly hue

would we find in the sunshine food for tears
and in the sunset of that splendid day
build up a sorrow that would haunt the years
till lifes last song forever passed away

and have you strength to know how life appears
when loves cup emptied must be thrown away

drayton is borne outward upon a wide white sea

chapter vi

a matter of buttons

when drayton and his friends
walked through the ulithian
moon they were none of
them either quite unconscious nor en-
tirely devoid of sense drayton for in-
stance knew that viola extended her

hand to him that he took it and that
her other hand was held by some one
else an indistinct personality whose
identity was of not the slightest interest
or importance

  they all knew that with the dizzy-
ing fragrance of a million blossoms in
their nostrils with blinding radiance
before them with behind them only si-
the heads of cerberus



lence and the silver plain they three
joined hands and so passed beneath the
black arch which had seemed a moon

  this dim apprehension however
was wholly dreamlike and unmingled
with thought or foreboding they pos-
sessed no faint curiosity even as to
what might lie beyond that normally in-
credible archway

  active consciousness returned like
the shock of a thunderbolt

  they had emerged upon the sidewalk
of a wide paved street they were but
three of a jostling hurrying throng of
very ordinary and solid-looking mor-
tals

  for several rpoments they experi-
enced a bewilderment even greater than
had come upon them in passing from a
prosaic house on walnut street into the
uncanny romance land which they knew
as ulithia the roar and rattle
which now assailed their ears deafened
and dazed them ulithia had been so
silent so unhuman and divorced from
all familiar associations that in this
abrupt escape from it they felt helpless
unpoised as countryfolk who have
never seen a city and to whom its
crowds are confusing and vaguely hos-
tile

  in this new place there was none of
that bright dazzling mist which had
filled the archway instead it was well
and more satisfactorily illuminated by
numerous arc lamps with a thunder-
ing clatter an electric train rushed past
almost directly overhead

  before them the street was a tangle
of dodging pedestrians heavy motor
trucks loaded with freight and baggage
arriving and departing autos and des-
perately clanging street cars above
iron pillars and girders supported an
elevated railway system close to
where they stood a narrow moving
stairway carried upward its perpetual
stream of passengers bound for that
upper level of traffic where the electric
train had passed

  turning the dazed wanderers saw
behind them not any vast expanse of
silver light but the wall of a long low
building pierced with many windows
and several doors from one of those
doors they had apparently just
emerged

  with some difficulty the three extri-
cated themselves from the throng of
hurrying foot passengers finding a
comparatively quiet spot by the wall of
the building they stood there very close
together

  suddenly viola gave a sharp excla-
mation

  but this-this is philadelphia
this is the entrance to the market
street ferry in philadelphia

  her brother slapped his thigh

  and to think i did not recognize a
place ive been at myself at least three
times but who would have thought
wed get home so easy-or at the other
end of the city from where we
started 

  suddenly the melancholy ex-lawyer
chuckled aloud

  i never thought he said that
philadelphia city of homes or not
would seem homelike to me by
george i realize now what a charming
old place it is terry couldnt you re-
sign wandering and settle down here
for the rest of your life-right on this
spot if necessary

  the irishman grinned cheerfully

  i could that so be there were not
a few better spots to be got at viola
im fair dead of hunger and so must
you both be is there a cafe in this
elegant station building or shall we
go home and trust martfri heaven
bless the boy i never thought to see
him again-trust martin to throw us
together some sort of sustaining meal v

  im hungry confessed viola
frankly but it seems to me we should
go straight to cousin jims house
rather than to a restaurant you know
that gray powder was left there-


the heads of cerberus

  trenmore gave a great start and his
smile faded

  that devil dust he burst forth
and all this time its been laying open
and unguarded faith after all we may
not find poor martin to welcome us
home

 my fault again said drayton
grimly if anything has happened to
martin i am entirely to blame in
common justice i shall have to follow
him-

 trenmore turned with a growl
you will not follow him is it an
endless chain you would establish be-
tween this world and that heathenish
outland weve escaped from you
after martin and myself after you and
viola after me i suppose-and there
well all be again with nothing to eat
and no one but spooks to converse with
no if martin is in ulithia this minute
may his wits and his luck bring him out
of it at least hes the same chance
we had

  call a taxi suggested viola prac-
tically its just possible that martin
hasnt yet fallen into the trap

  a very sensible suggestion my
dear commended her brother

  by the curb stood an empty motor
cab its driver loafing near by the
latter was a thin underfed-looking fel-
low clad in a rather startlingly bril-
liant liveiy of pale blue and lemon yel-
low with a small gilt insignia on the
sleeve a languid cigarette drooped
from his lips beside his gaudy attire
he wore that air of infinite leisure com-
bined with an eye scornfully alert
which all true taxi drivers are bom
with

  seventeen walnut street my man
directed trenmore and get up what
speed youre able

  drayton had made to open the cab
door since the chauffeur made no move
to do so to his surprise however
the latter sprang forward and pushed
his hand aside

  you wait a minute gentlemen

  is this cab engaged you have
the empty sign out

  no we aint engaged but wait a
minute

  the fellow was eying them with a
curiosity oddly like suspicion surely
aside from the fact that trenmore and
drayton were hatless there was little
out of the way in their appearance
violas attire was the picture of mod-
em propriety in crossing that ghostly
plain nothing had occurred to destroy
the respectable appearance with which
they had all begun the journey

 wait ejaculated trenmore
and what for isnt this a public
cab

  yes its a public cab right enough
there aint nothing the matter with
me ner my cab either the troubles
with you why aint you wearin your
buttons 

  wearing-our buttons

  terence glanced frantically down
over himself had the rapid transition
from one world to another actually re-
moved those necessary adornments
from his garments everything
looked in order he glanced up an-
grily

  not wearing our buttons is it
and what in the devil do you mean by
that you fool  is it fuddled with
drink you are

  the chauffeurs alert eye measured
the irishman its owner shrank back
against the cab

  dont you he cried dont you
hit me i dont care who you are you
havent any right to go about that way
you hit me and youll go to the pit for
it ive drove more than one of the
service itself and they wont stand fer
nobody beatin me up

  drayton caught the half-raised arm
of his friend

  dont terry he cautioned softly
why start a row with a lunatic
trenmore shook him off he was
the heads of cerberus



doubly annoyed by draytons assump-
tion that he would attack a man of less
than half his weight for an instant he
felt inclined to quarrel with his friend
on the spot then the petty childish-
ness of his irritation struck him and
catching violas appealing and aston-
ished glance he laughed shamefacedly

  i left my temper behind the moon
bobby he grinned as the three
started off down the sidewalk in search
of another vehicle somewhere along
here theres a bit of an office booth of
the taxicab companys isnt that it be-
yond the escalator 

  yes contributed viola i remem-
ber theres a sign over it quaker

city- why but theyve changed it

to penn service last week it was
the quaker city company

  whether penn service however
meant taxi service or something differ-
ent they were not to learn just then
ere ever they reached the wooden
booth beneath that white-lettered sign-
board a heavy hand had grasped dray-
tons arm from behind whirling him
about the two others also turned and
found themselves confronted by a po-
lice officer at a safe distance in the
rear their eccentric acquaintance the
chauffeur looked on with a satisfied
grin

  and what is this demanded tren-
more sternly

  drayton said nothing at all with
the policemans hand clutching his arm
fear had him in a yet firmer grip was
this another phase of the persecution to
which he had been recently subjected
was he about to suffer arrest here in
the presence of viola trenmore upon
some such trumped-up charge as had
sent his partner to prison and death

  in the bitter grasp of this thought
it was a moment before he compre-
hended what the officer was replying to
trenmores question

  -and if youve lost your buttons

for why have you not reported your-

selves at the proper quarters sure
tis me duty to run ye in without fur-
ther argument but tis a fair-spoken
soft-hearted man i am if youve a
raison give it me quick now

  drayton grasped the fact that it was
not himself alone who was involved
equally it seemed trenmore and his
sister were objects of the mans absurd
though apparently official attention
the lawyer in him leaped to the fore
here might be some curious local civic
ruling of which he a stranger to the
city had heard nothing

  what about the buttons officer he
queried do you mean that we should
be wearing some sort of button as an
insignia

  is it crazy ye are all after being
what buttons dye say why what
should i be meaning savin yer iden-
tification buttons what are yer num-
bers now  at least ye can tell me that
or are ye the connictions of a family

  there was a moments silence then
trenmore said heavily as if in some
deep discouragement faith i myself
was bom m county kerry but till this
living minute i never knew the mean-
ing of the words a crazy irishman
micky or pat or whatever your name
may be we are connected with families
so good that your ignorance never
heard tell of them

  and as for numbers i do not doubt
that you yourself have a number i do
not doubt that the driver of the poor
little jitney bus yonder has a number
in jails men have numbers and perhaps
in the lunatic asylum you both came
from they have numbers and wear but-
tons with those same numbers on them 
but myself and my friend here and my
sister we have no numbers

  we have names my lad names
and tis my own name ill send in to
the poor unfortunate chief that has
charge of yon and youll find that it is
not needful for terence trenmore to
be given a number in order to have such


the heads of cerberus

as you discharged from the force your
low intelligence is now disgracing

  as trenmore delivered this harangue
his voice gradually grew in volume as
his sentences grew longer until it
boomed out like the blast of a foghorn
the two or three idlers who had al-
ready gathered were reinforced by a
rapidly increasing crowd his last
words were delivered to an exceed-
ingly curious and numerous audience

  the policeman a man of no very
powerful physique quailed before
trenmores just wrath much as had the
taxi driver he too however had an-
other resource than his unaided
strength his only reply to the threat
was a sharp blast on his whistle

 youve done it now terry
groaned drayton never mind me
get your sister away from here if you
can-quick

  the young ladv mentioned set her
lips

  terry shall do not such thing mr
drayton officer surely you wont ar-
rest three harmless people because of
some foolish little misunderstanding
that could be set right in the twinkle of
an eye

  the policeman eyed her admiringly
-too admiringly in draytons estima-
tion

  sure miss he declared  tis my-
self is most reluctant to place incon-
venience on so pretty a lass but what
can i do ye know the regulations

  but indeed we do not protested
the girl truthfully

  before more could be said on either
side there came an eddy and swirl in
the crowd and two more policemen
burst into view one of them a ser-
geant by the stripes on his sleeve came
bustling forward with an air of petty
arrogance which drayton prayed might
not collide with his huge friends ris-
ing temper

  whats this  whats all this forty-
seven what have these people been

up to  what  no buttons  what do
you mean by going about without your
buttons this is a very serious and
peculiar offense forty-seven the
lirst ive ever met in this ward i am
glad to say under arrest certainly
you are under arrest the wagon will
be here directly what did you expect
what are your numbers what have
you done with your buttons anyway 

  how long the sergeant could have
continued this interlocutory monologue
which he delivered at extraordinary
speed and without pause for answer or
comment it is impossible to say he
was interrupted by a clanging gong and
again the crowd swirled and broke a
motor patrol drew up three more
officers leaped down and stood at atten-
tion

  the accession of numbers drove
from draytons brain any lingering
hope that trenmore might pick his sis-
ter up under his arm and bear her bod-
ily from the shadow of this open dis-
grace

  that the exasperated irishman had
not acted was due partly to reluctance
to leave his friend in the clutches of
the law partly to a rapidly increasing
bewilderment he could now observe
that every person in the front ranks
of the staring crowd did indeed wear
a large yellow button pinned below the
left shoulder and each bearing a per-
fectly legible number in black

  he could also see that these numbers
ran mostly into five six and even seven
figures but what those figures repre-
sented or why the wearers should be so
adorned or what bearing the ornamen-
tation might have upon their own lib-
erty was a puzzle before which the
recent mysteries of ulithia faded

  button button whos got the but-
ton he muttered faith tis a wild
and barbarous land this philadelphia
sergeant are you really going to run
us in just for not knowing what you
and the rest are talking of
the heads of cerberus

  the sergeant looked him up and
down appreciatively

  you know very well that i must
but lord man youve nothing to
worry over with the contests coming off
in a couple of days or havent you
any muscle back of that size of yours

  distractedly trenmore clutched at
his black wild hair

  take us to the station man  he
snarled and be quick as you value
your poor worthless life i muscle
ive the muscle to pull you to bits and
by all the powers it be driven to that
act if you do not take me to speak with
some sane man this living minute

chapter vii

a few small changes

tthe ensuing patrol ride while com-
monplace and uneventful from
the viewpoint of one accustomed to
such jaunts produced in the bosom of
hi least one of the prisoners emotions
of the most painful and poignant na-
ture it was not for himself that
drayton suffered

  in the recent past he had been too
thoroughly seared by the fires of unde-
served disgrace to be hurt by so trifling
a touch of the flame as this but that
viola trenmore-viola of the clear
blue eyes and innocent white brow-
that she should be forced to enter a
common patrol wagon and be carried
openly like any pickpocket through the
city streets was an intolerable agony
in whose endurance he alternately
flushed red with shame and paled with
ineffective rage

  trenmore the mighty also sat quies-
cent  but his was the quiescence of a
white-hot anger held in check for a
worthy occasion and object a pity to
waste all that on mere underlings

  having slowly ascended the short
steep incline where market street de-
scended to the ferry the patrol drove
on with increased sped a mile

ahead at the end of a long straight
brilliantly lighted perspective reared
the huge bulk of city hall the im-
mense buildings lower part was
sketched in lines of light its tower
gleamed gray and pale against the black
sky

  high upon that uttermost pinnacle
there brooded a ghostly figure it was
the enormous statue of william penn
set there to bless the children of his
city with outstretched benevolent hand

  are you taking us to city hall
queried drayton turning to the officer
on his left

  the man nodded your offense is
too serious of course for a branch
temple

 a-what r

  a branch said the man impa-
tiently headquarters will want to
handle this eh sergeant 

  they will but no more conversa-
tion please everything you say my
man will be used against you

  one would think we were murder-
ers reflected drayton bitterly of
what real offense could they have been
guilty beneath surface absurdity he
had begun to sense something secret
and dangerous something upon which
his mind could as yet lay no hold but
which might be revealed to them at city
hall

  the night was fine the hour eight-
thirty by the clock in city hall tower
the streets well filled most of the
stores seemed to be open and inumer-
able movie theaters saloons and
shooting galleries each drew in and ex-
pelled its quota of people like so many
lungs breathing prosperity for the own-
ers

 there was a new york bowery
touch to the amusements and the
crowds which drayton did not remem-
ber as characteristic of market street
the thought however was passing and
only half-formed

  the patrol clanged its way over the


the heads of cerberus

smooth pavement attracting the usual
number of stares and fortunately un-
heard comments and presently swung
off market street into juniper they
had approached city hall from the
east the patrol entrance being on the
estem side it was necessary for them
to pass half around the great building
to reach it

  as they passed the broad street en-
trance drayton chanced to glance up-
ward above the arch hung an emblem
done in colored lights it seemed to be
a sword crossing a bell above the
emblem itself glowed a number con-
sisting of four figures done in red
white and blue electric bulbs-

  the bell thought drayton might rep-
resent the old liberty bell philadel-
phias most cherished possession the
numerals however conveyed to him no
more significance than had those on the
yellow buttons these police so harped
on

  again turning the patrol reached
market street on the western side
shortly afterward it was rolling slowly
beneath the portico of city hall

  the public buildings to use the more
ancient name for philadelphias proud
edifice of administration and justice
are built in the form of an irregular
hollow square the large inner court
may be entered by means of any one of
four short tunnels placed at the four
cardinal points of the compass and
passing beneath the walls of the build-
ing proper

  as the three prisoners recalled it
that inner court was squarish in shape
paved with gray cement and of no
very beautiful or imposing appearance
several old cannon relics of past wars
adorned the corners and stood at either
side of the northward entrance in the
northeast corner there was a sort of
pavilion where various free civic ex-
hibits were perennially on view

  a patrol wagon or a black maria
generally waited near the southern side

of this court as the center of the
place was actually the intersection of
those two main arteries of the city
broad street and market two continu-
ous streams of pedestrians passed
through there all day long

  such was the interior of city hall as
the three prisoners remembered it and
into which they now expected to be
carried

  while yet in the short dark entrance
tunnel however the patrol halted
rising from their seats the officers
hustled their prisoners from the wagon
a moment later and they all stood to-
gether halted just within the rim of the
inner arch

  and there the three received another
of those wildly disturbing shocks of
which they had suffered so many in the
past few hours

  instead of a bare gray courtyard
open to the sky there stood revealed
an interior which might have been
lifted bodily from an arabian nights
entertainment

  above rounding to a level with the
roofs of the fourth story curved the
golden hollow of a shallow but glorious
dome it seemed to have been carved
solid from the yellow metal itself the
entire under surface was without a
seam or trace of ornament and was
polished to almost blinding brilliance

  striking upward upon it from invisi-
ble sources at the sides light was re-
flected downward in a diffused glow
yellow as sunshine and giving a curious
almost shadowless appearance to the
great chamber below from the center
of the dome swung at the end of a
twenty-foot chain depended a huge
bell this bell had either been enam-
eled smoothly or was cast of some
strange metal

  the color of it was a briliant scar-
let so that it hung like an enormous
exotic blossom some change or re-
pairs to the thing seemed to be in
progress for out to it from the south-
the heads of cerberus



ern wall extended a narrow suspension
bridge of rough planking that termi-
nated in a partial scaffolding about one
side of the bell no tongue or clapper
was within the bell nor was there any
visible means of ringing it

  as for the floor beneath it was of
common gray cement no longer an
exquisite pavement gleamed there made
of white porcelain or some similar sub-
stance seamless and polished in it
the blood-red bell and certain colored
panels of the golden walls were re-
flected as in a pool of milk near the
northern wall a design appeared in this
floor set in as a mosaic of varicolored
marbles

  where had been the southern and
eastern entrances short flights of green
marble stairs led up to carved golden
doors gothic in style and all closed
the windowless walls also of gold
were carved in heavy bas-relief at
regular intervals appeared panels done
in bright enamels representing various
weird figures resembling chinese gods
and heroes the entire color scheme
of red gold green and white had a
peculiarly barbaric effect itself entirely
out of keeping with the formerly staid
and dignified old public buildings

  trenmore as he gazed forgot even
his anger and stared open-mouthed
they all had time to stare for the ser-
geant having pressed an electric buz-
zer near the door stood at ease obvi-
ously waiting for something or some
one to answer the summons

  and is this the place they have for a
courthouse trenmore murmured
ftve seen the taj mahal and ive seen
the inside of westminster abbey and
st pauls but never never-

  i cant understand itl broke in
drayton desperately amazement had
given place to distress as the enormity
of the change came home to him
why but this is incredible its pre-
posterous  i-

  here here broke in the sergeants

brusque voice none of that what
were you muttering there never
mind be silent here comes a gentle-
man who will dispose of your case in
quick order

  at the south a golden door had
opened and a man was seen descending
the short flight of green marble steps
before it even at a distance he
seemed an impressive figure over a
largely checked vest he wore an exqui-
sitely cut frock coat his trousers were
of a delicate parl-gray hue and a pair
of white spats surmounted immaculate
patent-leather pumps on his head
gleamed a shining silk hat

  had the gentleman but carried a flag
gasoline torch or roman candle he
might have creditably adorned a politi-
cal parade a large bouquet would
have passed him well at a bowery wed-
ding amid the barbaric splendor
which actually surrounded him he
seemed out of place but happily uncon-
scious of that fact

  slowly and with dignity he advanced
while in the gleaming porcelain beneath
an inverted silk-hatted replica of him
followed every step at last his ma-
jestic progress ceased he had halted
some six paces from the group of pris-
oners and policemen without speak-
ing he surveyed them with a slow
long insolent gaze

  he was a small man handsome in a
weak dissipated way old with the age
of self-indulgence rather than years
his greenish-hazel eyes were close-set
and cunning he possessed a little
pointed mustache and in the opinion
of the prisoners an unjustifiably imper-
tinent manner

  out of the tail of his eye drayton
saw that his irish friend was bristling
anew well if the outbreak had to
come he wished it would burst now and
annihilate this silk-hatted monstrosity
no man could eye viola in just the
manner of this stranger and deserve
continued life


the heads of cerberus

  the high-hatted one deigned to speak

  well fifty-three he drawled lan-
guidly addressing the sergeant and
why have you brought them here the
chief is in attendance on his suprem-
ity and theres no one else about who
cares to be bothered i myself camc
over to warn you that penn service is
tired of having these trivial cases
brought to the temple lately you
police chaps seem to consider the tem-
ple a sort of petty court for pick-
pockets i

  t renmore pased the sergeant in one
stride

   you miserable insolent little whip-
persnapper he thundered in a voice
that was amazingly reechoed from the
golden dome above

  instantly as if sprung by a single
trigger the six policemen had hurled
themselves upon him high-hat
skipped back nimbly out of the way
drayton seeing no alternative with
honor flung himself into the combat
and was promptly knocked out by the
blow of a policemans billy

chapter viii

legal procedure expedited

yhen his senses returned dray-
ton found himself sitting on the
polished white floor his back propped
against a golden pillar he became
aware that his head ached horribly
that his wrists were handcuffed be-
hind him and that his tempestuous
irish ally was no better off than him-
self trenmore in fact lay stretched
at full length close by tears stream-
ing down her face viola was wiping
ineffectively at his bloody countenance
with her pathetic mite of a handker-
chief

  two of the six policemen stood
looking on with no evident sympathy
the other four lay or sat about in at-
titudes of either profound repose or ex-
treme discomfort though terence

trenmore had gone down he had taken
his wounded with him

  get an ambulance one of you
chaps it was the voice of silk-hatted
authority you think we want the
temple cluttered up like an accident
ward and bring those crazy prison-
ers of yours to the court of common
pleas mr virtue is there now and
one court will do as well as another for
this sort look sharp now

  saluting reverently the two unin-
jured officers proceeded to execute
high hats various behests as best they
could they were forced however to
leave the wounded while they bore
trenmore across to the southern door
viola started to follow then looked
back anxiously toward drayton high
hat following her glance beckoned im-
peratively

  with some difficulty drayton gained
his feet and staggered toward the girl
he felt anything but fit and he was
keenly disappointed all that shindy
had been wasted the insufferable one
yet lived--had not even suffered the
knocking off of his intolerable hat

  lean on me mr drayton he
heard v iolas voice curiously far away
and indistinct the absurdity of such
a request moved him even to laughter
but he certainly did lean on some one
or he could never have crossed that
heaving rocking slippery floor without
falling a dozen times

  presently blackness descended again
and he knew no more till the strong
taste and odor of brandy half-strangled
and thoroughly aroused him

  a policeman was holding a tumbler
to draytons lips and seemed bent on
pouring the entire contents down his
throat twisting his head away the
prisoner sat up the officer eyed him
wonderingly then drained the glass
himself and set it down

  feel better he queried

  a little muttered drayton he
was seated on a leather-covered couch
the heads of cerberus



in a small room and his only compan-
ion was the policeman i suppose
he added disconsolately that tren-
more was badly hurt where are they
now 

  the officer laughed if trenmore is
your big friend he came around sooner
than you did lord i wisht we had
that guy on the force can you walk
yet 

  drayton rose unsteadily i guess
so have you put the others in cells

  hardly  the officer stared at
him they dont keep a case like this
waiting your friend wont go in no
cell nor you either and as for the girl
- he broke off with a shrug

  and the girl  drayton repeated
sharply

  i dunno mr mercy was looking
her over i doubt hell let that beauty
go to the pit but come along or well
keep mr virtue waiting

  mr virtue what a very odd
name thought drayton as he walked
to the door leaning heavily on his
jailor and mr mercy too had he
fallen into a chapter of pilgrims prog-
dess what had they fallen into any-
way  had the whole world gone mad
while they wandered in ulithia and
what of this amazing temple that
had usurped the interior of city hall

  on the streets outside everything
had appeared normal-except for those
infernal buttons surely this was
philadelphia that they had returned to
who that had ever visited the city
could doubt its identity it was dis-
tinctive as new york though in a dif-
ferent way and all the familiar de-
tails-the market street ferry the
outer architecture of city hall broad
street-oh and above all that benev-
olent unforgettable statue of william
penn-

  the door opened upon a long low-
ceilinged windowless room illuminated
by hidden lights behind the cornice
the ceiling was a delicate rose-pink

and like the golden dome shed its color
downward upon a scene of oriental
splendor unlike the white-paved
court however this chamber was far
from bare

  the dark polished floor was strewn
with silken rugs of extravagant value
and beauty the many chairs and
small tables scattered here and there
were of ebony carved in the chinese
fashion their cushions and covers of
rose-pink velvet and silks gleaming
richly against the dark austerity of
black wood

  here and there the prevailing rosy
tinge was relieved by a touch of dull
blue or by a bit of yellow ivory carved
work several excellent paintings uni-
formly framed in dull black showed
well against the unpatterned matt-gold
of the walls

  rather than a courtroom indeed this
might have been the drawing-room of
some wealthy woman with a penchant
for the outre in decorative effects at
the chambers upper end however was
a sort of dais or platform there en-
throned on a wonderfully carved ivory
chair a man was seated

  he wore a black gown and a huge
white wig like that of an english jus-
tice he was hawknosed fat-jowled
coarse-featured and repellant if this
was-and drayton assumed it must be
-mr virtue then his appearance sin-
gularly belied his name

  before the dais were gathered a group
consisting of draytons fellow-prison-
ers a single policeman and akso the
little man in the silk hat and frock coat
from above them mr virtue stared
down with an insolent disdain beside
which the high-hatted ones languid
contempt seemed almost courtesy

  come whispered draytons guar-
dian walk up there and bow to his
honor theyve begun the trial

  the trial thought drayton there
were present neither witnesses jury
nor counsel


the heads of cerberus

  having no alternative however he
obeyed ranging himself beside viola
and bowing as gracefully as his man-
acled condition would permit as a
lawyer though disbarred he still re-
spected the forms of law however
strangely administered his own de-
meanor should be beyond reproach

  glancing at trenmore he saw that
the irishman had suffered no great
damage in the recent unpleasantness
and also that he was eying the en-
throned judge in anything but a peni-
tent spirit

  as for viola she stood with hands
folded eyes meekly downcast an ideal
picture of maidenhood in distress
drayton however caught a sidelong
blue flash from beneath her long lashes
which hinted that the trenmores were
yet one in spirit

  there was a further naounent of awe-
inspiring silence then the judge or
magistrate or whatever he might be
cleared his throat portentously

  mr mercy he said i believe
there need be no delay here from
your account and that of sergeant
fifty-three-by the way where is
fifty-three 

  in the hospital your honor having
his wrist set

  i see he should have waited until
conclusion of trial his presence how-
ever is not essential as i was saying
from his account and yours there can
be no question of either verdict or sen-
tence in view of the prisoners con-
duct within these sacred precincts
there will be no need to appoint counsel
or investigate the case further

  to conform however to the letter
as well as spirit of the law and in the
ipterests of purely abstract justice i
now ask you mr mercy as sole re-
sponsible witness of the worser outrage
if you can bring forward any extenu-
ating circumstances tending to mitigate
their obvious culpability and modify the
severity of their sentence

  drayton wondered if the policemans
billy had addled what sense ulithia
had left him had he really under-
stood that speech  he seemed to catch
a phrase here and there stamped with
the true legal verbosity as a whole
the speech was incomprehensible and
nowr mr mercy was replying

  your honor in the case of the male
prisoners i know of no excuse not
only have they appeared in public but-
tonless but beneath the very dome of
justice with their eyes so to speak
fixed on the scarlet threat of penn
they have assaulted and wounded the
emissaries of sacred penn service
for the third criminal however-for
this mere girl-child-i do desire the
mercy for which i am named sepa-
rate her from her evil companions and
who knows she may become as in-
nocent in fact as in appearance

  mr mercy ottered this plea solemnly
enough but at the conclusion he de-
hberately and languidly winked at the
judge and smiled upon the girl pris-
oner in a way which made draytons
blood surge to his wounded head

  were these proceedings in any de-
gree serious or was this all part of
some elaborate and vicious joke one
hypothesis seemed as impossible as the
other once more drayton bowed

  your honor he said surely even
at this preliminary hearing you will
permit us-

  but the judge interrupted him pre-
liminary hearing v he repeated scorn-
fully no man within the jurisdiction
of perm service can be so ignorant of
law as your words would indicate
were there any shadow of doubt as
to your guilt we in our perfect justice
might grant you a public trial we
might even permit you an appeal to mr
justice supreme himself but in so
obvious and flagrant a case of law-
breaking as yours the servants of
penn must decline to be further
troubled
the heads of cerberus



  i now therefore condemn you sir
and you the big fellow there-my soul
mercy did you ever see such an enor-
mous brute-i condemn you both to
be immediately dropped into the pit of
the past and may penn have mercy
on your probably worthless souls
having delivered himself of this re-
markable and abrupt sentence his
honor arose with a yawn tossed aside
the black robe and removed his wig
beneath the robe he was dressed in a
costume similar to that of their ear-
lier acquaintance mr mercy de-
scending from the dais virtue paused
to wave an insolent hand toward viola
trenmore

  you saw the girl first mercy he
addressed his silk-hatted associate
so i suppose shes yours you al-
ways were a devilish lucky dog

chapter ix

the pit of the past

deneath the golden dome of jus-
tice directly under the blood-red
bell where looking downward they saw
the latters crimson reflection as in a
pool of milk stood the three prisoners
that viola was there had been the
result of pleadings so passionate that
even mercy the pitiless and virtue the
gross were moved to grant them

  as to why any of them were there
however or what the queer sentence
of that still queerer judge flight actu-
ally imply they were yet ignorant

  this was their own world to which
the white moon gate of ulithia had re-
turned them and yet in some dreadful
manner they had been betrayed some
mighty change had taken place during
their brief absence how brief had
that absence beent

  beneath the bell drayton and his
companions had at least a few moments
alone together their isolation offered
no chance of escape the threedoors
of the great chamber were shut and

locked while across the old patrol en-
trance at the west a grate of heavy
golden bars had been lowered

  viola my dear said trenmore
my heart aches for you whatever
this pit of theirs may be theyve not
condemned you to it along with us i
fear tis for an ill reason that they
have spared you my own folly and
violence have brought me where i can
no longer protect you little sister but
for all youre so young and-and lit-
tle-youre a trenmore viola you
know what to do when pm gone oh
must i tear out my very heart to be
telling you 

  viola shook her head smiling
bravely

  pll never shame you terry when
you go dear life will be a small thing
that ill not mind to be losing and
terry ive a thought that this orld
weve come back to is our world no
longer weve no more place here than
we had in ulithia

  drayton started slightly

  then you believe-

  you must end this now broke in a
languid voice mr mercy had come
up behind them unawares back of
him appeared the figures of four other
men apparently convicts they were
dressed in loose ill-fitting costumes
yellow in color and barred with broad
black stripes their ugly heads were
close cropped their faces stupid and
bestially cruel

  awfully sorry to interrupt con-
tinued mercy fanning himself lazily
with a folded newspaper he carried
but we cant keep the pit guard wait-
ing forever you know dont cry lit-
tle one ill look after you

  viola turned upon him with flashing
tearless eyes w hen roused her temper
was as tempestuous as her brothers

  you insignificant rat of a man she
stormed fiercely do you believe i
would have endured the sight of you
even this long were it not for my


the heads of cerberus

brother here and mr drayton do
you believe ill remain alive one hour
after they are gone

  mercy looked a trifle surprised

  do you know my dear he drawled
i think youre devilish ungrateful if
virtue and i were not so soft-hearted
you wouldnt be here now oh well i
like a girl with a spark of temper about
her youll get over it if you really
wish to see the last of your heavy-
weight brother and his pal come
along

  turning he strolled off toward that
mosaic emblem set in the northward
pavement the four convicts closed
about the prisoners a moment later
having escorted them a short distance
in mercys wake the guard drew aside
the handcuffed prisoners now found
themselves standing at the very edge of
the mosaic

  the colored marbles beautifully in-
laid represented a huge chained eagle
pierced with arrows and reaching
vainly writh open beak after a flying
dove in whose bill appeared the con-
ventional olive branch on a scroll be-
neath three words were inscribed in
scarlet letters

  sic semper tyrannis

  they were the words of booth when
he bestowed the martyrs crown upon
lincoln so ever to tyrants inci-
dentally they were also the motto of a
state but the state was virginia not
pennsylvania what could be their
meaning here and where was this
pit of the past into which the prison-
ers were to be thrown

  the last question was immediately
answered on the far side of the em-
blem virtue mercy and their attend-
ant bluecoats had grouped themselves
now virtue stooped clumsily because
of his fat and pressed a spatulate
thumb upon the round eye of the mo-
saic dove

  instantly the whole emblem began to
sink it seemed hinged on the base of

the scroll a moment later and there
was just a hole in the pavement shaped
like the emblem and up from which
struck a strange reddish glare

  edging cautiously closer drayton
peered downward viola and her
brother joined him they stood mo-
tionless the ruddy light striking up-
ward upon their shocked fascinated
faces

  what they saw was a straight-sided
pit some thirty-five feet in depth
from top to  bottom the walls were
lined with tiny ruby-colored electric
globes at the very bottom sat a squat
gigantic thing

  with shoulders and head thrown
back the face of it glared up at them
the mouth distended to an opening of
some six feet across was lined with
sharp steel spikes slanting upward
the tongue was a keen curved edge of
steel in its taloned hands the monster
held two spears upright a tail also
spiked reared itself at one side and the
narrow forehead bore two needle-
pointed horns of steel

  so the space at the bottom of the
pit was filled anything falling there
must of necessity be impaled-if not
fatally so much the worse for the thing

  trenmore growled in his throat

   for sure said he at last you mur-
derers have gone to needless trouble
why do you not cut our throats with
your own hands the deed would be
fit for your natures

  virtue and mercy only smiled com-
placently

  sorry you arent amused drawled
the latter gentleman this little joke
was not invented for your special bene-
fit do you know who that is down
there 

  the statue of the devil you wor-
ship hazarded trenmore viciously

  oh no indeed quite the contrary
the statue of the devil you worship
my bellicose friend that is the god of
war and as he can no longer stride
the heads of cerberus



loose about the world we have made it
convenient for his devotees to drop in
on him in other words break the
peace of penn and youll get more of
war than you like sic semper tyran-
nusf any man who assaults another
is a tyrant by intent at least so down

you go-

  it was your police who attacked
me accused trenmore hotly

  mercys brows lifted

  was it i had rather forgotten
that does spoil my parable eh but
we shant let it interfere with your in-
valuable opportunity to worship the
god of war

  do you actually throw people-liv-
ing people-into that vile trap
draytons voice was incredulous so
theatrical so tawdry seemed this pit
of theirs like a stage dragon at which
one may shudder but not sincerely
we most assuredly do smiled vir-
tue he continued speaking but his
words were drowned and rendered in-
distinguishable by a great rattling roar
which seemed to rise from the open
pit itself the prisoners instinctively
sprang back from the edge

  there was nothing vocal in the noise
but if a bronze demon like that below
should start into hungry life just such
a mechanical reverberating roar might
issue from its resounding throat

  the sound died away what was
that demanded trenmore sharply
mercy laughed

  the subway of course the trains
pass under the temple foundations
you are the most curiously ignorant
crooks that were ever brought in here
where have you been living 

  virtue glanced at his watch mr
mercy if you are interested in their
histories would you mind obtaining
them from the young lady later on
im due at a banquet in half an hour
and im not dressed

  go ahead shrugged mercy we
can finish without you

  frowning the judge shook his head
his supremity demands regularity in
these affairs and you know very well
that the presence of the condemning
judge is required here then he
added in a lower tone which neverthe-
less carried across the pit i tell you
frankly mercy that he didnt like that
business last week you are growing
too careless of his opinion my dear fel-
low

  oh hes an old- hello there

comes lovely now we shall have to
hold the execution till she has looked
the prisoners over if we dont shell
be deeply offended

  a lot i care muttered virtue
nevertheless he lowered his hand
raised as if in direction to the guard

  a woman was approaching from the
doorway beyond the open pit tall
slender a striking blonde in hair and
complexion she was dressed in an eve-
ning gown of soft droopy lines sea-
green and deeply slitted to show slender
limbs clad in pale gold

  at first glance and a distance dray
ton fancied that lovely well deserved
her name but as she neared two facts
became painfully apparent the color
in her cheeks was not the kind lim-
ited by nature and her golden hair
waved back under a jade-green net
was of that suspicious straw gold eas-
ily bought but very seldom grown her
features however were regular and
clean-cut and her eyes really beautiful
they were large well-shaped and al-
most the very green of her gown

  smiling sweetly upon mr virtue the
lady extended her hand to mr mercy
and afterward swept the prisoners
across the pit with a cold indifferent
gaze when it rested upon trenmore
however her expression changed a
sudden light leaped into the sea-green
eyes the pupils expanded darkly

  what a perfectly gorgeous giant
virty she exclaimed turning to the
judge where on earth did you get
o

the heads of cerberus

him surely you were not about to
waste that on the pit

  why not his honor bestowed
another covert annoyed glance upon
his watch

  he has already beaten up four of
our blue boys laughed mercy
indeed how so

  mercy related the incident briefly
giving trenmore full credit and even
exaggerating his feats for narrative ef-
fect the lady laughed a silvery peal
of light-hearted merriment

  and you meant to throw all that
away in the pit how extravagant you
boys are its fortunate i came out
here now what i should like to know
is this why hasnt at least that one
she pointed at trenmore taken con-
demned right and entered for the con-
tests day after to-morrow why didnt
you number-number whatever your
number may be 

  trenmore eyed her frowning
madam i cant so much as guess
at your meaning if theres some way
out of this murderous business for my
sister my friend and myself wed take
it more than kindly if youll explain
lovely virtue protested snapping
shut his watch i really must leave
here immediately

  just a minute she flung him and
called across to trenmore you must
know the laws

  believing that their fate hung in a
delicate balance drayton intervened

  we are strangers here they
havent allowed us to speak or defend
ourselves but we certainly do not un-
derstand the laws and we have not
offended intentionally

  strangers strangers in philadel-
phia

  certainly this gentleman only re-
cently arrived from ireland his sister
has spent the last few years in the west
and  myself am from cincinnati

  the woman shook her head looking
more puzzled than before

  those names mean nothing if you
are really from outside the boun-
daries how did you get in 

  drayton hesitated a diplomatic an-
swer to that was under the circum-
stances difficult before he could
frame a sentence sufficiently noncom-
mittal a new figure had thrust its way
through the police guard and walked to
the womans side

  he was a man of about thirty-five
sharp-featured cunning-eyed and with
a thin-lipped mouth which closed tight
as a trap unlike virtue and mercy
the newcomer was attired in full eve-
ning dress a light cloak black and
lined with flame-colored silk was flung
across one arm in his hand he car-
ried a crush hat

  without troubling to salute her com-
panions and without the slightest evi-
dence of interest in the meaning of the
scene in general he addressed the
green-clad woman

  lovely he demanded in barely re-
pressed impatience are you intending
to go out this evening or not if you
dont wish to dance for heavens sake
say so i can take some one else

  she turned upon him a glance of in-
dolent scorn

  do that if you think best all my
life ive been looking for a full-grown
man to share my responsibility under
penn service now that i have found
one do you think i will let him be lost
in the pit 

  at this speech mr virtue gave a
sharp exclamation and mercy laughed
outright

  so thats what youre up to lovely
cleverest im sorry for you good-
night 

  the thin lips of cleverest parted in
an unpleasant smile

  i always knew youd throw me over
if you found a chance lovely you
mean to enter your protege for strong-
est i suppose

  certainly
the heads of cerberus



  and you believe he will be able to
supplant the present incumbent

  i know he will 

  ah well i shant despair you
may close the pit now but it can also
be opened again-after the contests
and what of these other prisoners 

  the woman laughed defiantly

  they shall have their chance too
virty i dont often question your deci-
sions do i but this time i wish you
to close your ugly old pit and with a
glance of disdain no oblige clever by
reopening it

  mr virtue glanced very dubiously
toward the thin-lipped man he ao-
peared not at all enthusiastic mercy
scowled

  dont forget me please virty ive
a very personal interest in this execu-
tion and even lovely shant do me out
of it

  oh shut up mercy broke in the
woman impatiently i can imagine
what your interest is youre afraid
this girls brother wont let you have
her but the law is the law and they
have their contest-right you never
think of any one but yourself virty
turn these people loose and  be re-
sponsible for their appearance wednes-
day

  cleverest are you going to stand for
this demanded mercy angrily

  but cleverest who had himself been
eying viola now smiled a strange fox-
like tight-lipped smile

  why not he asked simply if
lovely prefers the fellows strength to
my brains what can i do bat gracefully
withdraw

  the woman looked at him with a
trace of suspicion

  such amiability is really touching
clever but  take you up on it that
thin chap can go in for swiftest i

think and as for the girl- she

frowned at viola with a look of min-
gled dislike and reluctant admiration
oh well she finished the girl can
enter the contest for domestic excel-
lence

  slapping his fat thigh virtue burst
into a sudden roar of laughter

  splendid lovely you have it all
arranged eh mercy you and clever-
est are down and out take em-take
your charming proteges lovely my
child and shut up the pit old war
must go hungry to-night and now
youll excuse me lovely youve al-
ready made me miss at least one full
course v

  it would do you no harm to miss
more than that she retorted with a
disparaging glance at his waist-line but
virtue only chuckled without taking of-
fense and hurried away

to be continued

do you plan to go ahead

if you are out of gear repair your own machinery dont go crying to some
one else for help unless you need it talk with men higher up- study every
conceivable way of improving your standard of work efficiency

    get off somewhere mentally and look back over your days toil what
are you doing with it  continually plan new lines of advance every opening
higher up must find you prepared to fill it

    dont be afraid that by working so hard in your present position you will
be held there

    you cant work too hard if you work intelligently change your living
habits if they need it such a move might increase your capacity a hundred
per cent

robert barbee attorney at law
and representative to the state
legislature from one of the up-
state counties perched his feet on the
top of his flat-top desk and cast out
puffsof smoke from a strong and ill-
smelling cigar the legislature had
just adjourned and bob was well satis-
fied with his record as a member

  he had crowded through much legis-
lation some of it good some bad per-
haps-the future workings of it would
undoubtedly show-and among that
which he himself considered the good-
est of the good to use his own way of
putting it was a law for the compensa-
tion of those persons wrongfully con-
fined in the state prison as afterward
appeared

  the inception of this law in bobs
brain was directly due to a case he had
had at bar wherein a man duly con-
victed by a jury of his peers of the
crime of murder with recommendation
for mercy had been sentenced to life
imprisonment had served twenty-odd
years and was then released when an-
other on his deathbed confessed to
the crime and completely exonerated
the convict whom circumstantial evi-
dence had placed behind prison bars
bob had got him loose-which was

an easy matter after the others con-
fession

 but the man who had served the
prime of his life in jail came out broken
in body and spirit penniless a wreck
fit only for the poorhouse where he
eventually gravitated some weeks be-
fore his death

  at the time barbee had thought what
it would have meant to the wrongfully
convicted man had he been paid com-
pensation for each day of wrongful
confinement

  and the matter had buzzed in his
head for several years

  at last sent to the legislature he
drew a bill and got it enacted cover-
ing just such cases briefly the law
read that for each day any man was
wrongfully confined by a sentence of
any court in the state he should re-
ceive the sum of fifty dollars the ac-
crued total of which should be paid to
him by the state upon the establishment
of his innocence and his release

  the law was a good one and much
of it was made in the papers which ex-
plained it at great length

  and then nobody thought any more
about it-nobody that is save bartolio
kammenti and his friend stefe gat-
unexpected

suras who were nowhere near as for-
eign-looking as their names

  kammenti was a crook he would
perhaps have denied that allegation for
lie had not as yet let his crooked incli-
nations wander into the bypaths which
leadeth unto ruin yet behind his
scheming- brain lay the dormant germ
of a peculiar crookedness he would
not have taken your watch nor have
stolen funds intrusted to his care he
would not have committed murder nor
many other crimes he made a dis-
tinction between injuring an individual
and dipping into the public funds

  nor was he a petty crook all his
life he had been waiting for an oppor-
tunity to do something really worth
while

  he laid aside the newspaper account
of the convicts compensation law
as it had already been popularly dubbed
and sighed with firm conviction
plainly he was turning something in his
brain

  an hour later he gained admittance
to the home of stefe gatsuras

  stefe wasnt a crook himself he
didnt have nerve enough to be a crook
he was greedy oyerly fond of the ma-
terial things money would buy a man
who discounted his bills because he
hated to see the other fellow get the
money penurious in the extreme yet
vainglorious and paradoxically extrav-
agant when it concerned himself

  he was known as a tightwad
likewise he was known as a friend of
bartolios just why they ever hooked
up together no one knew nor did any
one know why that friendship appar-
ently parted-though a lot of people
thought they did

  kammenti laid the paper he had been
reading in front of the others eyes
see that article he said

  gatsuras nodded i was just read-
ing it before you came in sounds
like easy money making fifty bones a
day for doing nothing

 nothing is right kammenti
laughed all you got to do is bust
rock march in lockstep be kind to the
warden and any other little trifles you
may think of but say bo-its easy
money after its earned

  there was a peculiar inflection in
his voice that made the other look up
quickly what mean you he asked
scanning kammentis features closely

 silence came down between them
for an instant while kammenti re-
turned the gaze seeming to study his
man once for all at the last and then
he spoke

 would you like to make some
money stefe 

  would i say does a duck swim
is the earth round  does a babv nurse 
whats the idea

  kammentis gaze lowered to the pa-
per on the table

  again silence came down between
them broken after a time by stefe
i get what you mean-but i dont
im not incarcerated for a crime i

didnt commit-and besides-

 you said something about easy
money the other reminded

  lord yes-for the other fellow i
-i-well what do you mean anyway
out with it youve ot something on
your mind lets hear it

  it were easy to commit a crime

and afterward be guiltless of it-

 you mean you want me to knock
some one on the head with the hope
that afterward ill be able to prove i
didnt do it

  no you chump-i thought you had
some brains

  gatsuras sank lower in his chair
with a shrug  very well he an-
swered lets hear what you propose
-seeing youre the brains of this or-
ganization

  thanks for the compliment im
not asking you to be on the inside look-
ing out im willing to do the lock-


unexpected

step and stand the gaff just so youll
help me put it over there wont be
a single element of danger in what i
propose to do im tired of working
for two hundred a month when i can
lift that much in little more than half
a week and then its taken care of for
you you get it in a bunch where itll
do some good you can live on the in-
terest after you get out

  i can-i thought you said i could
be on the outside looking in

  oh piffle maybe i made a mistake
coming here-only  thought youd
jump at the chance since theres-say
-twenty thousand in it for you if you
help me

  at the mention of money the eyes
of the other glittered with an avaricious
light  and-i dont have-to be the
goat 

  no

  well-lets hear what youve got to
say

  kammenti took a cigar from his
pocket and bit off one end you see
ive doped out how we can beat that
law its quite simple ill steal five

hundred from you-

  the hell you will

  easy easy warned bartolio hand
lifted just wait till i explain ill
steal five hundred from you according
to your say so ill go out and spend
it-only itll be my own money ill be
spending but before i do all that ill
go around pulling a poor mouth and
trying to borrow from all my friends
hi play im plumb busted

  then all of a sudden ill go down
the line painting the town a deep ver-
million-and ill spend-just exactly-
five-hundred-dollars do you get
me stefe ill blow in five hundred
little iron men-or rather its equivalent
m bills then ill subside with the info
to a bunch of hangers-on that ive gone
dry

  see how itll all check out when you

set the laws machinery on my track

saying you had drawn from the bank
five hundred in bills had brought it
home intending to use it as first pay-
ment on some real estate you intend
buying had laid it on the table pending
the arrival of the seller of this land and
that when your back was turned 
horned in on the pile

  you dont discover its gone until
after im gone then youre tearing
your hair and raving like a madman
when this prospective seller arrives
hut before he arrives youve ditched
that five hundred where in four or five
years from now you can discover it
and be filled with horror and remorse
at what you have done that lets you
out on any charge of perjury that
might otherwise be brought up against
you

  you see absent-mindedly you slipped
that packet of bills into an envelope
with some other papers-and when you
tell this to the authorities in four or
five years from now ill be turned
loose youll get your rake-off and-
well what do you think of the scheme

  iatsuras nodded as in agreement
some scheme he averred  take no
risk you have all the inconvenience
i get twenty thousand for helping you
put it over and you want to stay in
there five years-

  depends on what the sentence is
kammenti cut in im not fond of
staying there too long ill know about
what my copperll be and we can both
figure it out to spring the innocence
stuff a month or two before id be nor-
mally turned loose

  ill demand a new trial as provided
under this law and in support of my
petition will file an affidavit from you
to the effect that you have made a mis-
take and falsely accused me then all
ill have to do will be to prove my in-
nocence as the state before had to
prove me guilty and-gadzooks
wbat is simpler you get your ait i
live in luxury the remainder of my life
unexpected



and everything is lovely and the goose

hangs high

  listens good sounds simple is
there any way you could fail have
von overlooked anything

   not a thing-and besides you
should worry youre not the one do-
ing time

  well that being the case-youre
cm but tell me of your plan in detail
i dont want to make a slip myself
and so it fell out that one crook had
made two crooks and some weeks later
bartolio kammenti was duly convicted
despite his desperate fighting of steal-
ing five hundred dollars in bills from
his friend stefe gatsuras

  time passed it was irksome to
kammenti-yet he contented himself
each night with the mental assurance
that another fifty dollars less stefes
irit were added to his fast-accumulating
pile

  and then when little more than three
years had elapsed he decided hed had
enough of prison life it wasnt worth
fifty dollars a day to be a convict it
was getting on his nerves his face
showed prison pallor his bearing lost
that assurance it had held prior to his
loss of freedom ambition was gone
and what in the beginning had been a
money making lark developed into a
nightmare

  his mental attitude was not helped
by the fact that a guard to whom he
had taken a personal dislike goaded
him by harsh treatment into an infrac-
tion of the rules that resulted in soli-
tary confinement for some days here
he had plenty of chance to meditate
and in the darkness of his cell he
decided it was time to get out

  so at the first chance he wrote a
letter to robert rarbee attorney at law
asking that he come to the prison and
see him it would be such a joke-
even though only he and stefe could
laugh-to have barbee the father of

this law unconsciously assist in mor-
ally perverting its intent

  he smiled as he thought of the joke
was the joke on barbee-or the state
perhaps on both he had earned a
snug sum it would be constantly ac-
cumulating pending the trial of his pe-
tition for rehabilitation it was not as
much as he had intended to earn by
serving but it was enough again he
smiled cest dr ole as the french
would say-it is droll

  barbee came kammenti swore with
much vehemence that he was innocent
he averred with all the impassioned ap-
peal that lay in his name that he could
prove his innocence-that barbee of
all men would dig up the evidence that
would free him he had not stolen the
money-and therefore some explana-
tion must be forthcoming-or gatsuras
were a crook but why should gat-
suras be a crook he argued he had
not profited by sending a man to
prison

  yet you had a fair trial and were
convicted barbee pointed out

  yet am i innocent kammenti
swore see i will prove it to you
may i have your pen and a piece of
paper 

  the other wonderingly complied

  then kammenti drew an order on a
bank in another state paying to robert
barbee an even thousand dollars it
practically closes my account he said
in explanation so it is all you will get
unless you prove me innocent-when i
will pay you another thousand

  the lawyer went away he saw
every person who had been interested in
the trial-or endeavored to he
worked for a solid week striving to
discover some additional evidence that
would enable him to entertain for his
client a petition for a new trial with-
out such new evidence a new trial
could not be given and it were useless
to make application

  then he returned to see his client


unexpected

  kammenti i have petitioned the
district court for a new trial but un-
less i can file some supporting affida-
vits at least five days prior to the hear-
ing on the petition as provided in the
law your petition will be denied and
no new trial given i have raked this
town with a fine-toothed comb and i
havent been able to dig up anything
new can you make any further sug-
gestions that might give me a new
start so i can run down something
to help your case

  as he spoke and the import of his
words percolated through the others
brain the convicted man turned paler
than his natural prison color he
seemed to be dazed had something
happened to upset their plans

  he had arranged with gatsuras that
when he was ready to get out he would
hire a lawyer have him file a petition
with the court and among others inci-
dentally call upon stefe-which would
be the signal for stefe to get busy or
maybe stefe would get busy gat-
suras had promised however that he
would arrange to discover the hidden
money within a few days after the
lawyer visited him

  and he would have a very good rea-
son for discovering it at that time
with a lawyer coming insisting that
kammenti was claiming innocence
stefe in the eyes of others might be
pardoned for doubting to the extent
of making a search of his premises to
allay the aroused suspicion that some-
thing might have happened to that
money besides having it stolen

  yet that had been more than a week
now surely stefe wouldnt wait that
long before making the discovery and
notifying barbee he could picture
how they had planned stefe should
make that discovery a few friends
would call as they were in the habit
of doing quite regularly the subject of

kammentis conviction would be
brought about in a natural manner-
perhaps by the relation of the lawyers
visit stefe would talk about it show
them just where he had laid the money
describe in detail all about the case

  and then he would suddenly stand
aghast-he had practiced simulating it
until he had it down to a seemingly
natural degree-they would ask him
what was the matter-he would sud-
denly remember he had laid some pa-
pers down there beside the money-
or was it on the money-and had
picked them up later and put them in a
telescoping envelope and had filed them
away where he kept papers of no great
value maybe-he would scarce dare
to voice the newly aroused suspicion-
maybe he had picked up the money
along with the papers not noticing
he would look he had not looked at
those papers since

  and then accompanied by those who
were present he would go to this old
box and search the papers stored
therein and would find the money-
would find it had never been stolen-
that he had sent his friend to prison
for a crime he did not commit

  kammenti pictured it all in his minds
eye he had coached stefe had re-
hearsed him for many days until he
felt stefe would do the thing just right

  and now-perhaps stefe hadnt yet
had time to make the find perhaps
even the lawyer hadnt seen him
though he had promised to do so as
well as to see every one else who knew
anything about the case

  and then bartolio kammenti quite
reeled and sank back to a seat at the
words the lawyer next spoke for they
condemned him to serve out his term
and without pay what the lawyer
said was

  t called on stefe gatsuras-he died
two months ago

the dull shadows of a january
sky came bleakly through the
cobweb-covered skylight dark-
ening the corridor as though long after

sunset

  in my haste to leave the gloomy hall-
way i opened the wrong door and
found myself in the dissection labora-
tary a gruesome room on the fourth
floor covering the whole width of that
end of the anatomy building

  a class of medical students were
working diligently on several cadavers
which lay on marble slabs or were
chained up in grotesque positions i
stood there shuddering unable to turn
my eyes from these dead bodies which
were wrapped and bound like egyptian
mummies

  a sudden jar caused the corpse of a
large negro to slip from its awkward
position and plop face downward on the
table sliding forward all the while as
he stiffened out his only arm straight-
ened over the edge of the table and
pointed directly at me ten seconds
i stood still never looking away from
the accusing hand that reached toward
me a tortured soul mocking me for my
morbidness

  the students in the laboratory con-
tinued their work with the cold deliber-
ation of a science harsh and unsenti-

mental i stepped back into the hall-
way and closed the door unnoticed-
except by two pointing black fingers
the only ones on the hand

  when i was once more in the dusky
corridor i saw a few paces away the
door i had overlooked on it was a
plate with gilt letters bearing the name
herbert graham phd professor of
anatomy i knocked and without
waiting stepped into the anteroom of
professor grahams office suite a
moment later the inner door opened
and an erect middle-aged man entered
smiling with warm hospitality as he
came forward

  say doc but fm glad youre in i
exclaimed as i enthusiastically gripped
his hand ive had an awful time get-
ting here

  just like your dad arent you
wild and impulsive graham re-
marked as he gave me a friendly slap
on the shoulder i shouldnt tell tales
but i was well enough acquainted with
him when we were in college so i know
what fm talking about guess he
hasnt changed has he and youre
here this semester to begin the law
course

  im going to try it i said grimly
anyway i know definitely that i was
never intended for a doctor


a mystery downstairs

  then much to the professors amuse-
ment i related my trying experiences in
the laboratory concluding with a melo-
dramatic recital of the negros pointing
arm

  youd soon get over that-its like
stage fright the boys work in there
with as little concern as in a kinder-
garten in fact they play some quite
unconventional tricks on one another
right now im investigating a prank
that went a bit too far-in fact a very
serious offense

  graham rubbed a hand over his
vandyke as he concluded his statement
and an intent expression came into his
eyes he noticed my curiosity and as
we sat down in the office he began to
explain what had happened

  quite often i work here very late
last night it was after midnight when
i was startled by a succession of
screams coming from the direction of
the janitors rooms downstairs he has
a couple of rooms in the basement di-
rectly under the south end of the
laboratory-in fact the inner room
comes almost under my office i ran
to the window and looked down but the
screams had stopped a light was shin-
ing into the alley from the window of
the inside room and dim though it was
i thought i saw a man sneak around the
comer of the building i hastened
downstairs to the janitors door where
i was joined by a policeman who had
been attracted by the cries we thought
we heard some one moaning we tried
to force open the door but it was
locked securely then we ran around
to the window from which the light
was shining it was open and together
we leaped into the lighted room re-
volvers in hand

  here the professor jumped to his feet
and slammed a fist on the table indig-
nantly

  what would you think of a gang of
fellows who sought amusement by ter-
rorizing children he exclaimed in a

loud voice in one comer of the
room trembling and sobbing was the
janitors child a lad not over thirteen
or fourteen next to the door that
opens into a hallway within the base-
ment there was a corpse seated on a
chair chained in a position facing the
bed in the middle of the top quilt was
the huge black arm of a negro recently
amputated its the most inhuman
thing ive ever seen i cant imagine
college men doing such work i be-
lieve that not thinking of the subse-
quent possibilities the miscreants
planned it as a spooky trick on the
janitor

  we tried to calm the boy but he was
too frightened to be readily assured and
as he and his parents who are sicilians
havent been in this country long i
dont imagine he understood much of
what was said we got him fairly
quiet and turned to the door that leads
to the other room we pushed it open
and switched on the lights but the room
was empty and there were no signs
of its having been recently occupied
there is an inside door in this room as
in the other that opens into the hallway
within the basement we opened it
and called loudly but received no an-
swer other than echoes across the
hall is the door to the cold-storage room
where the cadavers are kept but we
knew the janitor would not be in such
a ghastly place at that time of night
we closed the door and returned to the
room we had first entered but the boy
had disappeared its all very strange
i reported the occurrences to the dean
of course as well as the police i un-
derstand the janitor and his wife and
child have not been seen to-day i trust
that now some of our humorists are
well satisfied

  graham shook his head disgustedly
while m awe i gripped the arms of my
chair the telephone rang and as he
stepped to the waiting room to answer
it i relaxed in my chair observing
a mystery downstairs



the furniture and decorations of the

office

  it was an unusually cheerful place in
that ancient nightmare of a building
comfortable morris chairs were in the
corners there was an overstuffed
davenport near a glowing fireplace in
the middle of the room was a library
table strewn with magazines in home-
like untidiness shelves and bookcases
hid the walls and though the long rows
of medical and scientific treatises did
not interest me i was pleased to see
several sets of detective stories

  i observe you are fond of arsene
lupin and sherlock holmes i re-
marked as graham returned

  yes i read them a great deal he
answered i am somewhat of an ama-
teur detective myself-a very poor one
to speak truthfully but its my only
hobby and keeps dull hours away al-
though it isnt generally known  work
with the secret service quite often
my specialties are finger prints identi-
fication and handwriting rather a co-
incidence that it was streeter chief of
the service who just called rather
peculiar circumstances-may be con-
nected with the occurrences of last
night if you care for a bit of excite-
ment ill share the downstairs mystery
with you

  do i i exclaimed jumping to my
feet if you let me in on your adven-
ture this time youll wonder how you
ever got along without me

  streeter will be here soon so if
youll pardon me ill step over to the
laboratory and run out the stragglers--
its after class time for saturday after-
noon anyway we cant allow anybody
else in the building when we begin our
work

  the professor was not gone long and
when he returned he tossed a pair of
black fingers on the table

  the room is forsaken now he said
i found these little souvenirs over by
one of the wash basins some practical

joker cut them off your black friends
hand

  ugh i i shuddered and turned
away

  dont let it bother you graham
remarked you will see worse things
if you associate long with detectives
some queer cases we have

  a few minutes later streeter arrived
with several policemen the chief of
the secret service was a young man
shrp and erratic observing every de-
tail in spite of his restlessness

  tell you what he exclaimed jerk-
ily this is certainly peculiar know
rudolph hoffman used to be in the
supreme court he left in his car for
delmonte last night-suddenly called
away important business never got
there-found his deserted machine in
the park this morning colored chauf-
feur gone and this janitors kid that
got scared last night and ran away-
hes been working for the hoffmans
for a couple of weeks the servants
said he was terribly afraid of the chauf-
feur strange what do you say
graham sat down looked steadily
into the fireplace constantly running
his fingers through his hair after
some minutes he slowly arose pulled
out a table drawer and brought forth
two automatic revolvers and a pocket
flash light

  i believe he said slowly that we
will learn more beginning right in this
building have a couple of men guard
the laboratory door in the hallway
streeter-throw a cordon of police
around the building and the three of us
with an extra officer or two will search
the janitors rooms

  as you say streeter answered
snappily for whatever his own proce-
dure might have been he regarded gra-
ham highly enough to try the profes-
sors method first

  graham handed me one of the auto-
matics at the same time slipping the


a mystery downstairs

other and the flash light into his coat
pocket we were soon downstairs

  no one answered our hammering on
the janitors door and our skeleton key
was useless for the door was bolted or
blocked from the inside iron rods
formed a protective grating over the
windows of the front room and we
could not enter that way so we tried
the window of the rear room-from
which graham had seen the light shin-
ing early that morning

  the window was down but unlocked
and i had no trouble raising it i
raised the blind and graham flashed
his light in the room which was devoid
of occupants i jumped down into the
room and turned on the lights then
i tried the door which connected with
the front room but found it locked i
looked around but saw no evidence of
disorder or recent habitation all
trace of the terrible scene of a few
hours previous was gone

  perhaps the men that played that
trick got frightened after what hap-
pened and returned to remove the
corpse i suggested

 but i saw only one man-
and a man alone does not do
such things for amusement though
it is possible there were others i
did not see replied graham stay
in there and wait till we break in the
front door maybe we will find some-
thing you can have an officer for com-
pany if you like

  i dont need any help-ill take care
of myself i answered gamely and i
smiled grimly as i fingered my auto-
matic never imagining how a few min-
utes later i would regret my boastful
words

  graham and the others left as i sat
in the chair that had been the resting
place of the dead man grasping my
revolver i faced the door opposite the
window through which i had entered
the door that opened into the hall be-
yond which was the refrigerator room

where the cadavers were kept then i
observed that graham had closed the
window after first pulling down the
blind

  how slowly my friends worked sec-
onds seemed like minutes and in that
solitude each minute dragged like an
hour my watch ticked louder and
louder-louder and louder until i was
sure the sound would reverberate and
echo around the room nervously i
scraped a foot across the floor there
was a shriek i leaped up holding my
revolver tightly-my eyes were fixed
on the white knob of the door that
opened into the interior of the base-
ment it began to turn slowly around
and up chills ran down my back
another creak on the floor some one
was moving in the hallway no it was
the latch of the door i heard the
doorknob kept turning my heart
pounded like a riveting machine now
was the time-the latch was unfas-
tened the door would open and i would
face that dead negro back after his
arm click i was in darkness-the
light was out then i saw him in front
of me grinning relentlessly through his
dirty yellow teeth mechanically i
gripped the butt of the automatic and
pressed the trigger

  bang bang bang

  suddenly the light came on in front
of me was the closed door marked by
three bullet holes near the top the
doorknob still turned faster and faster
until it was whizzing around i
reached forward and touched it it
was not moving the reflection of the
light combined with my imagination
had been too much then when i saw
that the door was firmly bolted i was
disgusted

  i went to the window and raised the
blind at least there would be no repe-
tition of my childish fear if the elec-
tricity were again shut off

  i felt ashamed but i would be a man 
i deliberately turned out the light and
a mystery downstairs

ql

stepped over to the door i clutched
my automatic then quickly snapped
back the bolt and stealthily turned the
knob there was pressure from the in-
side and the door was pushed open
before i could shove back a man was
upon me a ghost but he harm-
lessly crumpled at my feet a corpse
again my nerves were terribly shocked
but i slowly recovered my self-posses-
sion the cadaver placed in that room
the night before had been leaned
against the door ready to fall on the
first one who opened it somebody
was playing the joke too well

  but i did not have time to philoso-
phize a puff of cold air like the
breeze off an iceberg fanned my face a
moment and was gone lingering after
was the nauseating odor of a carbolic
formal in solution this time i was
not the victim of hallucination i had
felt the presence of an invisible being
and to confirm that warning there had
come the chilling puff of foul air
some one in that black hallway had
opened and closed a door and i knew
well it was not the janitor

  there was no mistaking the source
from which that icy draft had come-
the refrigerating room but where in
all that dark passage was the door
and who thought i but some madman
would wander back and forth in and
out of that dismal catacomb

  i pushed back the corpse opening the
door far enough to slip through into the
hallway there was a murky blackness
all around and the melancholy silence
appalled me i dared not hunt the
madman but i took a step down the
hall to get out of the little light that
came through the partly opened door
as i did so i neglected to hold it
open and it shut with a click the
oppressive stillness in that dark solitude
was terrifying desperately i tried to
open the door it had latched securely
and the doorknob was missing

  i was alone in a stygian darkness

from which there was no escape i
had not even a match my automatic
what use was it when that nocturnal
monster could reach through the black-
ness and crush my throat with his skel-
eton hands before i could press the
trigger a revolver was no defense
against the chimeras and apparitions
that were conjured up in my disordered
mind

  in that tomblike stillness the sound
of my pounding heart would betray me
as it drummed against my chest my
throat was so dry i could scarcely
breathe those first agonizing mo-
ments were hours i wanted to faint
to scream to shoot the revolver crazily
to plunge madly down the hall but i
had not even the trembling strength to
move had i dared in my paralysis of
fear i remembered a maniac in a for-
eign country who had murdered people
and sold their bodies perhaps some
brutal moron was doing that very thing
in san francisco then my body
would be worth as much to him as any
other but if it were an insane fiend
with whom i had to deal he at least was
flesh and blood i had protection if i
used it quickly enough then i heard
a low humming sound as of a huge
machine muffled by many walls
through my tortured brain there
flashed a vision of the terrible pendu-
lum in poes story perhaps this was
even a more horrible instrument

  then a light came on at the western
end of the hall and i saw that no one
else was there in the north wall was
the door which led to the refrigerating
room and almost opposite was another
door which i knew opened into the
front room of the janitors apartment

  the peculiar murmur of the machin-
ery ceased and instantly the light went
out my revolver encouraged me as i
crept toward the west feeling my way
along the wall at last i found the
door to the front room which was un-
locked and i opened it slowly my cau-


a mystery downstairs

tion was unnecessary-there was no
one there

  my friends were smashing in the
outer door and had nearly broken
through when i pushed back the bolt
and opened k

  what has happened man cried
graham we were worried we
heard shots in this room and thought
you were in trouble

  you heard me shooting i ex-
plained but it was in the next room
instead of tins and i only imagined i
was in trouble

  they listened intently while i told of
finding the cadaver and about some one
in the hall just a moment before myself
graham showed great satisfaction
when i spoke of the sound of machin-
ery and described the mysterious ac-
tion of the lights

  that helps a lot he said as it is
weve made a lot of noise and have
alarmed no one in the building but well
search the room and be as quiet as we
can

  graham stationed an officer at the
outer door the rest of us began a hur-
ried examination of the room soon
the professor showed us a sheet of
paper lying among other foreign news-
papers on a table on this paper were
two large reddish-brown finger prints
and below them a small cross that
was marked in the same color

  heres something muttered gra-
ham two finger prints and a sign
marked in blood-the seal of some un-
derworld organization it was evi-
dently placed here for the janitor and
his wife to see before they entered the
next room and found the cadaver and
arm the tnore emphatic warning
graham turned to me saying go up
to the top floor and learn what the
guards have seen or heard take one
of the men in with you and see if any-
thing unusual has happened

  i was not enthusiastic over visiting
die laboratory but determined to carry

through my part i did as the profes-
sor requested and ten minutes later was
reporting back

  the guards are certain they heard
some one in the laboratory i said
and that niggers moved he was far-
ther back on the table and hes got both
arms now-both of them pointed right
at me and hes still stretched out the
southwest window was the only one
open and one of the faucets was turned
ort but there wasnt any one there
we searched every place even the
door to the elevator shaft was fastened
some way so we couldnt open it

 while you were gone streeter
called tip the hoffman home graham
informed me and i learned that two
fingers of the chauffeurs right hand
were missing also that he had been em-
ployed there less than a month now
what conclusion do yon draw from
these facts

  thats the chauffeurs body up
there some one sold it to the uni-
versity the judge was killed at the
same time and his body disposed of
probably the same way

  no no that negro has been there
a week the chauffeur and hoffman
have been missing since last night
only

  then the murderers cleverly substi-
tuted his body for the one that was
there

  no its the same body besides we
do not know that these men have been
murdered your imagination is get-
ting away with you

  then von think there wasnt some
one in the hallway or that i didnt hear
peculiar murmuring noises beyond
that part is plain enough the
noise is the sound of the elevator run-
ning between the refrigerating room
and the laboratory it opens on those
two floors only the strange action of
the lights was caused by a circuit being
made as the elevator stopped probably
upstairs it is run by an electric motor
a mystery downstairs



and a short circuit occurred because
of defective wiring of course there
is some one beyond the hall and he has
an idea of what we are doing your
three shots disturbed him in the hall-
way after he had placed the corpse
against the door he went upstairs
with the negros arm and put it back
on the cadaver it had not been cut
off when i was there yesterday nor the
fingers when he reached the labora-
tory and replaced the arm he looked
from the window and probably saw a
policeman or two near the outer door
then he went to get a drink and left the
water running well go after him
now

  streeter called in three officers and
posted one in each room and detailed
one to go with us then i borrowed a
flash light and we cautiously entered
the hall from the inside room through
the door which i had opened before in
a more daring way to my surprise
the corpse which had fallen on me was
gone graham took this fact as a mat-
ter of course however telling us that
the person who had taken the arm away
had also disposed of the body removing
it while we were in the front room

  we flashed our lights in the hall as
we tiptoed toward the door that opened
into the refrigerating room we
turned off the lights as the professor
opened the door and we slipped into
a vestibule graham slowly pushed
open a door in front of us the room
beyond was dimly lighted and very
cold a familiar sickening odor burned
my nostrils

  we heard the murmur of the eleva-
tor which became fainter and fainter
as it rose upward i wanted to push for-
ward but graham warned me that we
might have to deal with more than one
person

  so we entered the room slowly and
quietly but there were no signs of life
instead everything in that gruesome
chamber was suggestive of death a

row of ghostlike bodies in morbid
shrouds hung along each wall of the
sepulcher i had felt dejected and
gloomy when i entered the dissecting
room upstairs but in this cold tomb i
was afflicted with a depression infinitely
worse-a feeling of despondency crept
over all of us even the professor who
was so accustomed to this grim form
of death the heavy stillness so op-
pressed me that i could no longer re-
main quiet i shoved graham and
streeter aside and strode into the mid-
dle of that grisly cavern where i stood
peering through the pale light at the si-
lent victims of bloodthirsty science
the odor of the preserving fluid was
nauseating it cut into the membrane
of my nose my eyes smarted i felt
weak and very sick the lights danced
up and down and the cadavers whirled
around my dizzy head

  gradually my nerves became a little
steadier and at the whispered com-
mand of graham i joined in an ex-
amination of the catacomb i was close
beside him near the north wall when he
uttered a quiet exclamation on a
shelf almost concealed by the bodies
hanging in front he had discovered a
kit of dissecting tools evidently stolen
by the man for whom we searched

  look at this said graham point-
ing to the side of the kit

  i looked and saw two fingers marks
daubed in blood i shuddered as i re-
membered that same sign on a piece of
paper and i thought of those black fin-
gers graham had so carelessly dropped
on his library table we motioned for
streeter and the policeman it seemed
a little safer when the four of us were
close together who could tell when
those dead men would step down from
where they hung these thoughts con-
stantly flashed through my mind
then i would curse myself for a fool
and temporarily regain my nerve

  i could remain quiet only a few min-
utes my nerves were taut and ready-


a mystery downstairs

to snap suddenly i walked away
from my companions and stood alone
in the middle of the room my friends
were separated from me by a row of
cadavers as they continued to search
the shelf the dim electric light cast
faint shadows around me as i looked
toward a massive steel door barred and
locked securely it was the entrance
to the cadaver pond where the bodies
were thrown into a solution to remain
until the ghouls of science claimed
them

  thank god i muttered we dont
have to look in there

  then as i turned toward the door
of the elevator shaft the light went out
leaving the room coldly dark the sud-
denness was a warning i did not use
my flash light nor did the others flash
theirs in silence we waited

  once more i heard the murmur of
the elevator machinery and i faced the
shaft entrance fearfully the door
clicked and i heard the heavy step of
some one entering the room my heart
pounded erratically in my paralyzed
throat my knees trembled an in-
stant then my body became rigid and
cold

  suddenly the light came on and i
faced a huge negro he was startled only
an instant then crouching viciously like
a gorilla he came toward me quickly
traversing the twenty feet between us
i could not move and in my terror i
forgot my friends though i could not
have cried out had i tried

  the giant negro raised a hand to-
ward me just as the cadaver had done
in the laboratory one fact zigzagged
through my disordered brain two fin-
gers on that hand were missing

  it was this realization that brought
back my senses as the monster
reached for my throat i leaped aside
and with astonishing coolness pointed
my automatic with a panthers quick-
ness he was upon me grabbing at my
wrist but too late as he pressed

against me my weapon began to spit its
little lead pellets together we fell on
the damp floor my companions
reached my side as i crawled from un-
der the brute i arose unsteadily-but
he was there to stay

  you finished him said graham
quietly as he bent over the body
streeter look in the elevator

  i was so dazed that i stood by
dumbly hands in pockets and shivering
all over

  good work said graham as he
gripped my shoulder things will be
easier now

  then an exclamation from streeter
drew our attention we huried to the
elevator where he was bending over
two bodies graham stepped in but
i had seen enough and could not help
them remove the bodies

  just as i thought graham said
here is the cadaver that was in the
janitors room last night the other is
hoffman a blow on the head did it
now well go upstairs and search the
laboratory

  the elevator with its sinister hum
rose with us to the laboratory forsaken
except for ourselves the guards en-
tered from the hall and we searched the
room we looked in closets under
tables on shelves and in every possible
hiding place but found nothing

  i give up said graham in loud
tones of disgust this is all for me-
now weve got to get some of the labo-
ratory assistants up here to remove the
cadavers the boys were studying when i
ran them out if you menll wait a
minute ill finish the work on this one
myself

  he picked up a knife and placed it
firmly against a body that lay shrouded
in gray cloth there was a scream of
pain and rage as it jumped up i stood
aghast there seemed no end to the
terrible things that were crowded into
that last hour
a mystery downstairs



  the cloth dropped down revealing
a veritable derelict of a man whose
bloodshot eyes looked into a row of re-
volvers

  uh-huh exclaimed graham tri-
umphantly another murderer a
friend of the janitors arent you
the captive nodded his head dumbly
the murderer of the judge arent
you youre a murderer out with
it do you want to be hanged in the
catacombs  speak up

  no no stammered the prisoner
no murder-no murder the nigger
-he done it

  graham was now a different person
harsh cruel and merciless-sweating
the truth from this criminal

  you lie you are not the janitors
friend-you threatened him where
is he where is his wife wheres
his boy  dont lie to me ill let your
chimpanzee comrade choke you nor-
wood take the elevator down and bring
him up-get the chauffeur hes told
us everything this man is lying-
when that nigger finds hes being dou-
ble-crossed hell pull him to pieces
no no no-the nigger killed the
judge i wasnt there he was going
to rob him-hit him too hard i wasnt
there i scared the janitor away we
wanted to hide the tody

  graham cross-examined him rapidly
with the cleverness of a great psychol-
ogist

  our police arent fools we know
your game weve got you you
threatened the janitor didnt you and
made the boy work for the judge-
made him spy through the house--kept

him terrified by the nigger you
couldnt rob the place-so you faked an
outside message and got the judge
started for delmonte and the chauffeur
murdered him talk up has nor-
wood started down yet-yes just going
-wait till he brings that orang utan
up here then youll talk

  no no i didnt kill-i didnt kill
the nerve-wracked man was trem-
bling and his eyes bulged out as he
spoke i didnt know till after we
were to rob i wasnt there-he found
me we ran the janitor out and left a
warning-the boy came back and saw
wed cut a couple of fingers off the
hand he remembered the nigger and
it kept him scared there was only two
of us the janitors all right-they
went to his brothers i didnt kill
grahams manner suddenly changed
now that he had the whole story i
knew he disliked the mental browbeat-
ing that was so necessary under these
circumstances and i was relieved to see
him smile streeter stepped forward to
slip on the handcuffs and i moved to-
ward the hall door

  there was a cry of warning as
something whizzed past my head and a
quivering sthetto struck the wall in
front of me i turned and saw the
prisoner dash past the officers and run
toward the open door of the elevator
shaft without hesitating he jumped
for one of the cables-and missed

  when i looked down there was only
a dim light shining through the top
grating of the elevator now at the bot-
tom of the shaft but it was sufficient to
show the outline of a lifeless body

accomplishment

it is not length but quality that counts in the game of life take this lesson
to heart it isnt the number of years you live that matters but what you
accomplish during that time

from behind drawn shades in the
library alcove homer judson
watched three persistent callers
striving to gain admittance the fact
that one was knowlton his legal ad-
viser and another peter bosworth air-
craft millionaire gave him no comfort
the third man was wardell of the dis-
trict attorneys office and the latters
presence argued for vigilant silence

  occasional glimpses of an officers
helmet far down the driveway added to
his uneasiness nor was that all-other
helmets he knew would also be found
at each entrance to the judson estate

  he shook his head grimly the chalky
whiteness of his haggard features ac-
centuated by the dark background of
curtains it was the age-old game of
fox and hounds and he the quarry-
winded outgeneraled exhausted-stood
hopelessly at bay in his own home

  two avenues of escape lay open to
his choice by risking an all-day wait
hidden in his lair as it were evening
would augment opportunity for a suc-
cessful dash to his private hangar
then under cover of darkness he could
outdistance the blue-clothed hounds by
flight in his eaglet

  or there was one surer way

  the three callers gave up their at-
tempts to force an entrance and drove
rapidly away in an open car judson
watched the machine out of sight the
intensity of his emotions evidenced by
twitching throat and jaw muscles

  when the car was no longer visible
he hurried to his desk from which he
secured a large-calibered revolver re-
moving two empty and four loaded
shells from the cylinder he pulled the
trigger several times in quick succession
satisfied that the action was flawless
he slipped six loaded shells into the
chambers and pocketed the weapon

  without seating himself he wrote a
brief message on a sheet of note paper
pondered over it a moment or twu
scratched out four words added an-
other line then signed his name this
done he surveyed the room from where
he stood

  at length he crossed to the fireplace
and attached his note conspicuously to
the mantelpiece next he stepped to
the alcove for a final inspection of the
now deserted portico after which he
seated himself by the hearth and drew
the revolver from his pxrket
burnt bridges



  there was nothing theatrical about
his actions no smile softened the grim-
ness of his features each movement
was performed in the precise manner of
one whose purpose is both desperate
and definite

  lifting his eyes to the deep-framed
portrait above the mantel he studied
its beauty intently constance bos-
worth had been a wonderful girl he
thought-even more wonderful than the
great artist had portrayed her

  his absorbing hope had been that
some day she would reign as queen of
his home for her he had forced the
money markets to do his bidding had
gripped and held the financial world by
its throat that constance might have
riches no other man could bestow upon
her

 and then-

  uncertainty shadowed judsons coun-
tenance for the first time the grave
pensive eyes of that canvas likeness
seemed to regard him with a reproving
look some finer hidden chord within
him was stirred scarcely perceptible
beads of moisture gathered on his brow 
he appeared to shrink in his chair

  long minutes ticked by before his
gaze finally lowered to the quaint bronze
clock beneath the portrait then to his
farewell message below his breast
swelled from a deep indrawn breath as
he elevated the weapons muzzle till it
pointed toward his right temple

  vaguely conscious that it was then
less than two minutes of eleven he
centered his eyes on the clock dial while
his finger slowly contracted against the
revolver trigger his lips tightened at
the same time his entire body grew
rigid in expectancy

  noisy quarreling sparrows alighted
upon a near-by window sill only to van-
ish in terror when an instant later the
concussion of a pistol shot jarred the
window pane

  almost on the echo of the shot jud-
son caught the sound of a door being

  athriil

opened of swishing skirts and swiftly
running feet his right hand descended
with extreme slowness and pungent
grayish smoke floated from the revolver
muzzle in an irregular spiral a dis-
torted smile of triumph not unmixed
with amazement warped his face when
the runner a living counterpart of the
portrait paused breathless before him
homer oh h-o-m-e-r 

  ah-constance i thought you were
--how did you get here he whispered
if you imagined you could save me

youre too late-

  too-late

  her eyes dilated in horror a look
which quickly changed to haughty dis-
belief

  what hideous joke have you chosen
to perpetrate this time not satisfied
with trying to kill herby and me you
would frighten me with you savagery
for reply judson pointed to the
threadlike stream of blood trickling
down his right cheek

  constance saw and horror again re-
turned to her eyes

  oh homer how could you she
moaned had i the least inkling that
your rashness would lead to tragedy
i would never have crossed your de-
sire

  wtiy waste such verbal salve upon
me he asked leeringly

 are you even unkind enough to
doubt me

  no but im not convinced

  then what proof can i give you
wearily

  die with me now

  he held forth the still smoking
weapon

  that i cannot do she cried draw-
ing back in fear my life is not mine
to forfeit

  rot

  do you honestly think so know-
ing that you are now dying by your
own hand what do you imagine your
self-murder has brocfght you


burnt bridges

   nothing else than the oblivion i

crave

  and why do you crave it

  wtiy when lifes bereft of riches
love happiness whats left its a
nightmare-a shell of mockery like

your own fickle heart-

  you are unkind homer yet be-
cause of your delirium i can forgive
you have chosen to escape those things
which are but the refining test of life
blinded by your self-pity you are un-
able to foresee vast realms of anguish
and woe of which earth holds no store
it is the cowards way

  coward  faugh it takes nerve to
do what ive done it takes grit to face
the end when you feel yourself grow-
ing weaker to see the shadows settling
for the last time soon everything will
be shut out for all time-even you
and you feel no regret 

  no sneered judson

  youre not even sorry when ive
hurried back to tell you my heart is
yours entirely

  humph your penchant for hon-
eyed sayings shows no sign of abating

  but homer its true-

  yes no doubt its true-after ive
killed young romaine whom you would
have in preference to me

  how spiteful your egoism i felt no
love for herby he was sympathetic and
considerate while you were selfishly un-
kind-but have you not been told 
your shot merely stunned him his

wound is slight-

  some more of your chaff eh i
tell you i aimed straight at his snivel-
ing heart-small difference it makes
however-youll go to him anyway he
has riches mine are gone had you
stood firm id have made you the rich-
est woman in the world i was putting
them all underfoot that you might be
supreme-and at the most crucial hour
i find you hobnobbing with that fop of
a romaine scheming to break my
power eloping under my very nose

you can thank the luck of fools that
my shots did not get you bothl

  now observe the results of your
treachery to-morrow profane hands
will despoil the home i created for you
-that wonderful picture of you up
there will be stripped from its place
i can see you gloating over my down-
fall  others will gloat with you my
fickle beauty but little i care now
another hour and-pouf then you
can bury me in the potters field and
be-

  but homer wont you listen it is
evident youve not heard the good news
youre not ruined as you imagine the
market changed at the very last mo-
ment-youre richer now than ever be-
fore 

  what shouted judson are you
telling the truth  dont lie to me con-
stance 

  her hurt look maddened rather than
shamed him his sneering manner
slipped from him like a cloak animal
fear and utter selfishness blinded him
to all but his own danger

  im rich you say-in spite of them
all god what then have i done
a fool for haste-he fell to cursing
-repeat your words constance the
truth-i must have it

  if you do not believe me why not
telephone -coldly

  to be sure the very thing-but no
another of your tricks to trap me eh
he cried

  his harshness brought tears to her
eyes repressed sobs prevented her from
answering he tried to rise but a
weakness he had not yet noticed checked
his effort

  dont stand there staring-do some-
thing-bring me a doctor-call the
servants youre not going to let me
die are you he muttered cringing
then rage took possession of him til
live if only to spite you he cried his
voice hoarse ill not die-i must not
die-
burnt bridges



  by supreme effort he gained his feet
cursing wantonly as he cast the revolver
from him like a maniac he brushed
constance aside and staggered to where
he could view his face in the pier glass

  ah he said slowly his face almost
pressed against the mirror in his at-
tempt to examine the self-inflicted
wound after all an unsteady hand
has paid me well-im only scratched
im safe

  constance remained by the hearth
her awe-filled eyes following his every
movement he wheeled and strode to
her side a grin made ghastly by his
pallor bared his teeth constance
watched as if fascinated

  now  find out whether youre in
earnest or not repeat that promise

i say-

  you must calm yourself homer
im only too willing to keep my word
but youre running a grave risk by be-
coming so excited

  excited not at all my beauty
the risk is in delay- he glided un-
steadily in the direction of the telephone

the bishop shall--

  sounds of terrific pounding at the
outer doors interrupted him he
halted surprised at first then a gleam
of cunning crept into his eyes the
dormant savage writhin him was mani-
fest as he whirled upon constance

  and youve been telling me the
truth eh he cried and fool that
i am i almost believed the police are
again at the door-hear them

  are you sure she breathed you
have not looked it may be some one
bearing the good news i told you of
he darted to his post of observation
staggering back after one brief peek
through the curtains

  come he commanded beckoning
her to the alcove see his whispered
monosyllable sounded harsh and indis-
tinct theyre after me a minute
more and your betrayal would have

got me wratch me outwit the clumsy

fools

  seizing her hand he half led half
dragged her through the house to the
breakfast room there helmeted sil-
houettes outlined against the curtained
french windows sent him scurrying
to the hallway and-to the kitchen but
as a means of escape the kitchen door
was impassable and to his angry dis-
appointment the conservatory entrance
was equally as well guarded from with-
out

  though the noise of attack increased
he neither halted nor relinquished his
grasp of constances hand craftily he
reconnoitered the situation by stealing
from window to window at last in-
spiration came to his aid-the coal chute
was unguarded expressing his elation
by a sharp oath he rushed constance
down the basement stairs

  the chute was only large enough to
permit one person to crawl through at
a time he entered first dragging con-
stance roughly after him both
emerged in open air unnoticed by the
cordon of officers

  an expanse of lawn lay between them
and the rose garden with very little
shrubbery to screen his flight even the
rose garden itself would afford slight
protection against vigilant eyes once
in the maple grove beyond however
his chances would be bettered except at
the high rubble wall which separated
the grove from the hangar field

  with a muttered command for con-
stance to run he sped for the rose
garden she clung to his hand vfrith
listless obedience though her speed
failed to equal his own

  midway of the garden judson heard
shouting at the house without looking
back he knew it to be the cry of their
discovery he redoubled his speed but
was soon hampered by constance now
hysterical and stumbling at the edge
of the maple grove she fainted and fell

  almost without halting he cast a look
ioo

burnt bridges

over his shoulder then cursed wantonly
foremost among the rabble of blue-
coated police and morbid citizens was a
familiar bandaged head

  the addle-pated fool himself he
muttered and i thought i killed the
puppy

  constance stirred slightly he swept
her up in his arms and went speeding
on through the grove through the
low-hanging interlaced maple branches
he could see the roof lines of the hangar
if he could reach it with just a half-
minute margin to spare he could outwit
them all-no speed was yet known that
could equal the eaglet once in full
flight their capture would be impossible

  clear of the maple grove he was con-
fronted by the rubble wall unburdened
with constance it would have been no
obstacle at all deciding quickly he put
forth all his strength and tossed her limp
form to the top of the wall swinging
up after her with fear-born agility

  back in the grove the pursuing offi-
cers were brandishing weapons but
were not shooting young romaine
was within a stones throw when jud-
son dropped into the hangar field and
pulled constance down after him

  to reach the hangar would expose
him to gunfire should his pursuers
choose to shoot yet he struck out across
the intervening space unhesitatingly
half the distance was covered before
the first officer topped the wall albeit
this lead was lessened dangerously by
the time he entered the hangar and
bolted the rear door behind him

  he deposited his still unconscious
burden in the rear cockpit without
strapping her to the seat time was
too precious to waste in ceremony and
adjusting the spark he hastened to open
the huge sliding doors

  the hue and cry of pursuit was close
when he whirled the propeller back
one revolution the motor caught with
a snapping roar and almost before he
reached and climbed under the cow

the machine went skimming from the
hangar

  at the same instant the rear door was
smashed from its hinges yells of rage
rose from the throats of his pursuers
though he failed to hear them above the
roar of the motor a flush of puerile
exultation swept over him but as the
car began to elevate realization that
neither he nor constance was clad for
the cooler altitudes damped his joy

  and too the rush of air began to
bother his injured head he laughed
however a derisive laugh as recklessly
he circled above the heads of his
thwarted pursuers after a dozen spi-
rals which carried him higher with each
turn he bore away southward

  constance now conscious shivered
and moaned in her seat judson looked
back at her crouching figure then
passed her the audiphone motioning
for her to adjust it

  now do you see what it means to
try and corner me he questioned
through the transmitter a triumphant
smile accompanying his words tve
not only beaten those thick-witted
sleuths at their own game but ive got
you in the bargain

  where-where are you taking me
she asked tearfully

  anywhere thatll prevent your run-
ning away from me again-well live
in a paradise of our own he answered
with an unnatural buoyancy of tone

  but why did you not get my things
and say good-by to mamma-

  he interrupted with an inane chuckle

  where we go you will soon forget
all thats left behind neither care nor
want will ever trouble you-my riches
will buy every pleasure he cried

  but i have no wraps and fm so

cold-and-afraid- her words

trailed away in a sob

  judson gave little heed he was look-
ing down upon the broken country be-
low chancing to look backward he
yelled blasphemously far to the rear
burnt bridges



was another machine and there was
no mistaking the fact that it was in full
pursuit

 high peaks loomed ahead he
mounted higher to clear them the cold
becoming more intense as he rose his
teeth chattered behind blue lips and the
fiery pain in his head increased to agony

  another backward glance informed
him that his pursuer was approaching
at a speed greater than his own other
machines seemed to be joining in the
chase

  clouds drifted in fleecy banks above
by rising he could benefit by their ob-
scurity yet the additional height would
be a hazardous risk considering his
light apparel and weakened condition
but with no other alternative and with-
out thought of constances comfort he
sent the machine soaring upward

  he regretted the move before he
reached the desired height for a numb-
ness began to creep over him al-
though he realized that he was losing
both mental and physical power to guide
the machine he fought doggedly to re-
tain control of himself

  for safety he began a rapid descent
at the same time exerting every ounce
of will to keep from being overcome by
dizziness below the cloud strata he
nearly came to grief against a series
of cloud-screened ridges tilting the
elevator he shot up again avoiding
disaster by the barest fraction of time
and space

  with each successive escape how-
ever danger beset him in greater pro-
portions puzzled to note that dark-
ness was coming on at such an early
hour he gazed at the sky-and gasped

  directly above so close that recog-
nition was easy he espied romaines
machine with the latter peering down
upon him he fairly choked from curs-
ing raving because the revolver had
been left behind wondering what sort
of craft romaine possessed to have
overtaken the eaglet so soon

  the lust for battle revived his wan-
ing strength momentarily he ad-
vanced the throttle to its limit yet both
machines drove into the gathering dusk
their speed equal and terrific

  suddenly to judsons amazement
romaine dropped a rope ladder from
the upper machine and began to climb
down it fascinated by the utter daring
of the act judson could do no more
than stare for a moment then schemes
of treachery grew in his mind

  he prepared for a sharp sweep to
the right but his hands stiff and numb
from the intense cold refused to obey
his will abject fear gripped his heart
he tried to concentrate his thought that
he might break the spell which held
him his sensation was one of freezing

  even the effort to turn his head was
futile a slight jar apprised him that
his pursuer had set foot on the eaglets
fuselage and he steeled himself for his
enemys attack

  none came a fact which filled him
with hope he wished that romaine
would come forward or that constance
would say something to know that
help was only an arms length behind
and yet to lack the power to call or
reach for it was an agony in itself

  he endeavored to speak into the au-
diphone three times he shaped his lips
to utter an appeal for help-then the
stupefying truth dawned upon him-
he was paralyzed

  a tremor passed through the eaglet
after which the machine began to tip
a splintering crunching noise sound-
ing above the roar of the motor deaf-
ened judsons ears and the flying car
collapsed

  during the fleet instant of time that
his nerveless body poised in space his
mind quickened above he could see
romaine steadily mounting the rope
ladder with constance strapped to his
back then his last breath went out in
a sigh as he began to fall

  the massive front door of the judson


burnt bridges

home burst inward with a crash under
the onslaught of two brawny police-
men wardell entered first followed
by knowlton and a quartet of reporters
without speaking they gathered around
the chair from which two death-glazed
eyes stared straight into the painted
one that looked down from the portrait

  well gentlemen-the district at-
torney bent forward to better view the
blue-edged powder-burnt hole by jud-
sons right ear-you may call the coro-

ner homer judsons victims will sur-
vive but his last shot went truer

  the lifeless bundle in the chair
seemed to greet the announcement with
a shuddering sigh then the last twitch-
ing nerve relaxed the revolver hand
slipped from its resting place on the
chair arm the weapon dropped to the
hearth

  and in the silence that followed
eleven deep-toned strokes tolled the
hour from the mantel clock

  among the stars

 by albert owens

 there as i talked to you across the wire

the night drew close around us like a veil

 for i had found a single singing trail
 oer which you came to me like living fire

 then all the things that you and i aspire
 to win from fate like some romantic tale
 fresh from a dreamers pen seemed dull and frail
 beside the beauty of a great desire

 and i who met you weeping once among

    the stars your hair in darkened strands of light
 that round your face like gentle fingers clung

   paused for a single moment in the night
 to wonder if the songs that i had sung

found you with faith to dare the splendid flight

disentombed
to wed

    being a transcript of william grays verbal version of a most remarkable
development in his mystic transcontinental metempsychosis with the body and
soul of his other self arthur wadleigh of cape town british south africa
-editor

 william gray have gazed
upon the dead body of my other
self arthur wadleigh in a cape
town burial-ground mausoleum

  for the better understanding of this
startling statement by those who may
read this and might not have read the
preceding three tales published in the
thrill book let me briefly rehearse
the circumstances which led up to this
denouement in my strange two-bodied
two-souled existence

  when arthur wadleigh died and was
placed unembalmed in a burial vault it
was believed by the scientists studying
my double-ego problem that the occult
link between myself and wadleigh had
been severed but as i still experi-
enced a mystic urge which sent my soul
across the eight-thousand-mile interval
between new york city and cape
town in vain efforts to enter and ani-
mate the body of my dual self science
became convinced that it was on the
threshold of a still more startling series
of phenomena in my ease

 every phase was reviewed and
studied especially with reference to the
first symptoms of my plurality when i
as william gray a wall street stock-
broker would fall asleep and immedi-
ately awake in cape town as wad-
leigh or as wadleigh would fall
asleep in cape town and immediately
awake in new york as myself william
gray

  a learned thesis on my case was read
before the american psychological
foundation by doctor mordaunt p
dale eminent psychic expert and fel-
low of the international academy of
scientific and supernatural research

  the scientists there gathered were
asked to make suggestions the only
one adopted was made by doctor ver-
non l barris that i be taken to cape
town his argument was soundly
logical

  when mr gray is in the same city
with his other self he at least may be
able to sleep both will be subject to
the same daylight and night hours


tales of the double man

besides both men being there-at least
one i mean wadleigh presumably be-
ing dead-science can study these phe-
nomena the easier and better than with
eight thousand miles separating the two
physical bodies of the double man 

  consequently urged by doctor dale
and my own family physician doctor
marvin porter i arranged all my af-
fairs and gave charge of my brokerage
office at no  wall street to my
chief clerk in my absence then in the
company of doctor porter doctor
dale and several other scientists inter-
ested in my case i set sail for cape
town crossing the united states to
san francisco for the pacific route

  arrived in cape town i expressed
atr intense curiosity to see my other
self and was taken to the vault where
arthur wadleigh lay in his casket
this casket it will be remembered was
sieved with holes to admit air and the
lid also was left unfastened so that
wadleigh if he really were alive could
rise from the coffin without struggling

  i never shall forget the sensations
that thrilled me as i raised this lid and
peered at the face of wadleigh it was
my own face-every feature of it even
to the mole on the right cheek near the
ear his dark-brown hair slightly
wavy his blue eyes his height and
build all duplicated my own i lifted
his left hand for the purpose of veri-
fying a statement he had sent me in a
letter replying to mine in the first days
tof our inter-transmigrations sure
enough the wart on my left thumb
near the nail exactly corresponded with
the wart on his thumb near the nail

  his body showed no signs of de-
composition in fact he had every ap-
pearance of a mutual living man i
could not believe him dead although
there was no respiration no pulse and
no slightest sign of life in the cold day
before me

  beyond the scientific world no one
knew of my arrival in cape town

i dreaded notoriety and willingly con-
sented to disguise my features other-
wise as on a previous visit when wad-
leigh and i crossed each others paths
in mutual determination to see each
other but without achieving that result
because mutual impulses on each occa-
sion set his face west and mine east
going and mine west and his east com-
ing wadleighs friends and acquaint-
ances would be certain to recognize me
and my stay in cape town would be
marred by many unpleasant if not ac-
tually awkward occurrences

  such an eerie feeling haunted me
having seen myself as i actually would
look dead that i became delirious and
ill for a week i lay in a semi-con-
scious condition in the home of doctor
philip spaulding who had attended
wadleigh over me watched doctors
porter spaulding and dale together
with that renowned french genius
doctor lucien trebaux master of oc-
cult lore and psychic manifestations
who also had studied wadleighs and
my case in conjunction with doctor
dale

  when i recovered one week later i
was warned to prepare for a shock i
braced myself i had need to do so

  mr gray said doctor dale deep
sympathy in his voice miss elaine
brandon has become insane from grief
at the death of mr wadleigh her
fiance

  i could feel the color leave my face
elaine-insane  the girl i loved-had
learned to love-when as wadleigh i
courted her in the arbor of her home
great heavens had i not suffered
enough already without this fell blow
at my happiness

  tell me more doctor i cried

 miss brandon went to mr wad-
leighs mausoleum to lay a floral wreath
on his casket explained doctor dale
her heart was breaking because she
felt she had done him an injustice in
disbelieving his story that he and you
tales of the double man

 were one man even though eight thou-
 sand miles apart i hardly can credit
 the story she told especially since she
 immediately became mentally unbal-
 anced after telling it

  what did she say doctor i asked
  it is so unbelievable he hesitated

and yet-

   tell me 

  she placed the wreath on wad-
leighs casket at the foot said doctor
dale then she went to its head to
gaze through the glass-windowed lid at
the man she loved he seemed so life-
like that she was not frightened but
as she stared she says his eyes
opened

   and then  i cried as the physician
 paused

  he raised the lid and took her in
 his arms

  wadleigh i asked incredulous
  so she says

  what then

  she fainted

 and-

  recovered wadleigh she said
was lying in his casket lid down just
as before i cant believe it

  any other details i asked
 y-yes doctor dale seemed em-
 barrassed

  tell me all i urged pm the
party most interested you know

  so you are mr gray he agreed
 you may remember that especially
 constructed thermos bottles filled with
 liquid food were placed in the vault 

  i nodded

  well-theyre empty

  wadleigh lives  i yelled pve
 told you hundreds of times i never be-
 lieved he was dead

  but he is dead mr gray it is
inconceivable that science should be
mistaken i believe miss brandon in
her insane frame of mind ate the food
it is impossible to get anything coher-
ent from her now

  my mind thus reverted to elaine i

 experienced deepest grief for the sweet
 girl whom i had won by a semiproxy
 wooing she had written that with
 wadleigh dead she never would marry
 any other man but i had vague hopes
 that i might win her being such an
 exact counterpart of wadleigh that she
 could not detect the difference

  wras my hope to be destroyed by her
insanity was there no method by
which she might be restored to rea-
son  i discussed the subject with doc-
tor dale and doctor trebaux they
both agreed that the only chance for
miss brandons recovery was for her to
believe wadleigh still lived

  to this end and for this purpose i
doffed my disguise and took up my
residence in wadleighs house the rear
of which faced the rear of miss bran-
dons home i recalled the many morn-
ings when as wadleigh i had leaped
the boxwood bounding our respective
grounds and kissed elaine before go-
ing to the office of the london ivory
company perhaps her mind might be
restored by such a morning event re-
peated

  elaine consequently was brought
home from the private sanitarium
where she had been taken and was
given her former room which faced to
ward mine

  with beating heart next morning i
went to my window as i had done so
many times before in the person of
wadleigh and gazed toward the bran-
don homestead at her window stood
elaine staring toward my window
waved my hand to her the distance
was not more than one hundred and
fifty feet i could see her features-
every dear detail of the loveliest face
i ever have seen unless i except that
of my own lost fiancee erla kingsley
far away in new york who likewise
had rejected me when i told her my
strange story

  at first elaine evinced doubt then
interest then eager yearning succeeded
io

tales of the double man

by an ineffably wondrous brightening
of eyes and sudden startled compre-
hension the look of insanity fled and
gave place to a perfectly normal ex-
pression

  i waved again

  this time elaine responded with a
joyous salute blowing me a kiss as
well just as she had been wont to do
before tragedy blighted her life across
the gardens i shouted

  meet me at the boxwood fence
elaine

  back came her happy cry ill be
there

  happily i turned away from the win-
dow rushed into the room i had al-
lotted to doctor dale and told him the
joyful news

  shes sane i cried sane
watch doctor ive told you as i
promised so that you can study her

  ndition

  without waiting to hear his reply i
hastened out and down the stairs
through the hall and into the garden i
literally ran to the boxwood border
elaine was just leaving her home and
was walking toward me her step
sprightly her face wreathed in smiles

  elaine i called the yearning of
my heart concentrated in my voice

  arthur came her glad cry-al-
though i was william gray

  across the low-cut shrubbery i held
out my arms elaine leaned toward me
we kissed i can remember the thrill
of that kiss now-shall rerfiember it
until i die

  you were ill elaine i said ten-
derly i was quite worried are you
better now

  quite well arthur she said
isnt it nearly time for you to go to
the office 

  i evaded her question

  im on vacation i said truthfully
enough may i breakfast with you
this bachelor dining is getting tire-
some

  she rippled a laugh

  youre always so ridiculous ar-
thur she replied but youre per-
fectly welcome mother will be glad
to see you im sure

  i bounded over the boxwood and
strolled with her into the brandon
home mrs brandon who had been
informed of our little conspiracy to win
elaine back to reason met me with a
motherly kiss

  im so glad to see you arthur she
cried i guess you were eating your
heart out while elaine was sick she
was quite delirious-spanish influenza
has that effect you know

  and is she entirely out of danger
now  i asked my voice tender

  so doctor trebaux says-oh heres
doctor trebaux now

  i turned to greet the eminent french
scientist he was a wrinkled genius to
say the least his forehead was seamed
with deep lines it was quite low his
hair came close down toward his eye-
brows and covered much of his tem-
ples but his eyes were the sharpest i
ever have seen with these he gave me
a knowing look as i bowed to him
acknowledging the introduction
spoken by mrs brandon although i
had met the doctor before as i have
stated

  so-our little girl is better eh he
murmured turning to elaine let me
see your eyes closely mademoiselle-
so

  he placed a thin wiry hand to
elaines chin and tilted her head so
that her eyes were on a level with his
own he being slightly the taller the
most piercing glance i ever have seen
he gave elaine telling her to gaze
steadily into his own eyes

  what he saw evidently satisfied him
for he smiled reassuringly at mrs
brandon and myself

  entirely cured mme brandon he
said i neednt attend mademoiselle
any longer i shall give similar treat-
tales of the double man



ment to other patients-it worked so
well in your daughters case

  thank god-and you doctor
breathed mrs brandon while i echoed
her remark

  the wedding need be delayed no
longer he said slyly and elaine
blushed rosily squeezing my hand in
returning my own pressure upon hers

  was i ill very long mother  she
asked

  several weeks elaine but its all
over now youd better rest now eh
doctor

  it would be well-er-er-yes
hesitated the savant

  are you in doubt  asked mrs
brandon suddenly terrified isnt she
well-really well

  what i really would like to see he
said slowly would be for mademoi-
selle brandon to take a vacation-go
somewhere-he grinned affably-
say on a wedding trip-for a few
weeks

  i understood his object he wished
to prevent elaine from learning that
wadleigh actually lay dead in his tomb
she could not wed a dead man i was
the dead mans counterpart he knew i
loved her she would love me thinking
me wadleigh no harm would be
done the plan suited me-more than
suited me i glanced toward mrs
brandon she seemed dubious

  it is best for mademoiselle argued

doctor trebaux otherwise- he

shrugged significantly mrs brandons
dubious expression vanished in a sud-
den surge of motherly solicitude for
her daughter who again might be
stricken were the specialists advice not
taken

  well she murmured if elaine
has no objections-of course i havent
i merely hesitated as any mother will
to lose my daughter so soon

  you gain a son madame quoth
doctor trebaux his reputation is
unblemished-as you know

  ive had such strange dreams
sighed elaine i thought you were
dead arthur

i gazed at her with tender reproach
i have too much to live for-win-
ning you-to die i chided and re-
joiced at the sudden surge of color in
elaines cheeks

  how soon shall they marry doc-
tor interrupted mrs brandon break-
ing in on my fond nonsense

  right away-to-morrow he said
firmly else i shall not be responsi-
ble for a possible relapse

  but objected elaine i cant
marry-to-morrow

  why he queried frowning

  i havent sent out invitations-

havent prepared-

 tut tut he scoffed you
couldnt stand the excitement of a big
wedding you must have a quiet home
affair with only family members and
a few friends present mademoiselle
is it to be or do you wish to relapse
again into a sickness from which i can-
not expect a second recovery v

  elaine stared at him with wide eyes
was i so ill as that doctor she
asked

  indeed yes

  and i may relapse-if i dont
marry at once

  yes mademoiselle

  then-can you marry me-to-mor-
row arthur she asked turning to
me are you ready-do you care if it
is only a little home wedding you
have so many friends you know

  was i ready to marry this sweet
blushing wonder woman my eyes
told her even before i spoke

  now-if you wish it i said ecs-
tatically

  and so our wedding date was set
for the following evening at eight
oclock

my sleep the night before my wed-
ding day was fitful and disturbed by
sensations hardly possible of descrip-
io

tales of the double man

tion once when i awoke to semi-
consciousness or i might term it a
vague awakefulness i can swear that
i felt the lid of a coffin as my hands
spasmodically reached out  it was
quite gruesome i can recall dimly
wondering if i actually were animating
the corpse of arthur wadleigh in his
tomb who can say that i did not do
so or that wadleigh and i again
had not become subject to that strange
link of destiny which had caused our
former marvelous metempsychosis

  daylight came as a welcome harbin-
ger of my joy that was to be ere the
moon waned on this days evening i
should have elaine as my bride was
ever man happier than i i hummed
gayly as i dressed my face was fairly
beaming with smiles of joy i mar-
veled at the change in my countenance
when i beheld it in the mirror as i
brushed my hair and adjusted my neck-
tie it was a transfiguration compared
to that unhappy day when i first
noticed the streaks of gray at my tem-
ples caused by the horrors of my dou-
bled-up estate so also had wadleigh
been unhappy in the hour he also found
himself growing gray we were both
young men-thirty-two years old only
but that sorrow was in the dead past i
told myself swerving the channel of
my thoughts toward the girl i was to
wed this night immediately the night-
mares of sleep were forgotten

  i rushed to my window elaine al-
ready was at hers waiting to greet me
i weaved my hand and blew a kiss to
her across the garden greens and she
reciprocated in kind then with light
heart i turned away to go downstairs
for my breakfast usually set out by
wadleighs housekeeper on the dining-
room table

  seated at the table facing me as i
entered the room was my second self
arthur wadleigh-risen from the
dead

  my nightmare had been no chimera

  after all i actually had reanimated
my kindred self lying stark and cold
in death within an entombed casket a
thousand thoughts flashed upon me as i
stared in open-eyed wonder at my du-
plicated human entity wadleigh like-
wise stared at me

  he had been insane when he died
but his eyes now held no slightest sign
of mental aberration but he was pal-
lid and i know that i also was waxen
in color the strange thing about this
encounter was that i felt no horror
but merely amazement and wonder 
did not shiver with dread neither did
wadleigh

  we faced one another for fully two
minutes without speaking-two men
exactly alike drawn thus mysteriously
together from the ends of the earth
an antipodal distance of eight thousand
miles

  his soul had been incarnate in my
body my soul had been incarnate in his
body we both loved the same girl-
elaine brandon-who was to be my
bride this night at eight oclock-the
girl whom i just had saluted a few mo-
ments ago across the garden space or
had it been aeons since i greeted elaine

  my bridal night  great heavens-
no it was wadleighs wedding night
-not mine i was an interloper only

  mr wadleigh i questioned feel-
ing such a query banal

  yes-you are mr gray came his
reply-in my voice

  i am mr gray may i explain my
presence in your home

  i can surmise he replied slowlv
and sadly but you are welcome tell
me about it please we are in the
hands of some sinister fate i had just
entered and sat when you arrived
martha-my housekeeper-seems to
have taken as good care of you as she
did of me f was hungry and was
about to eat when you walked in just
to think-only a few minutes ago-
ugh-h wadleigh shuddered
tales of the double man



  i know i said soothingly i
knew you were not dead how did you
waken 

  you woke me he exclaimed
then your soul having stirred my
soul into active being again you bed
the tomb-probably to fall asleep here
am i right

  i told wadleigh of my weird night-
mare and how my hands had touched a
coffin lid

  unhappy men that we are he ex-
claimed bitterly why are we such
toys of destiny you lost your reason
i lost mine you lost your sweetheart

i lost mine-

  no mr wadleighli interrupted
quickly you shall marry elaine-
to-night

  amazed wadleigh stared at me
marry-elaine-to-night he re-
peated impossible

  but you shall wradleigh i cried
in supreme renunciation of my own
happiness if you wont- shall
you

  yes otherwise elaine may become
insane-again i was particular to
emphasize the last word he was quick
to notice the emphasis

  again  he asked

  yes i explained she became in-
sane after a visit to your tomb she
went to lay a wreath on your casket
she told a wild story of your rising and
clasping her in your arms she fainted
when she revived and returned home
she told her story then she lost her
mental poise the scientists studying
our case were called in they decided
the only plan to restore her to reason
was by having her believe i was you
we tried it the plan worked elaine
was told that for several weeks she had
been ill-spanish influenza you know-
and that she had been delirious she
believed it she mistook me for you
then for fear she should learn the
dread truth again and become insane at
the knowledge you actually were dead

it was arranged that i should marry
her to-night as yourself arthur wad-
leigh and go off with her on a pro
longed honeymoon i entered into the
plan-for your sake wadleigh-and
hers and youre a lucky man to be
alive-to wed such a girl think man
to-night your wedding night

  wadleigh shook himself as though to
arouse from some dream

  that was mighty generous gray
he said but-you won her-its your
wedding

  yours old man i cried heartily
i shall leave cape town if the sci-
entists permit but say  im starved i
lets eat

  i sat opposite wadleigh surely
never on earth before had there been
such a strange beginning of a wedding
day

  footsteps sounded  the stairs in
a few moments doctor dale the sci-
entific genius who had been studying
our case peered in at the door to greet
me-and saw me in duplicate

  he started rubbed his eyes as
though to get the sleep out of them
then stared with unbelieving orbs at
wadleigh and myself

  i rose quickly and introduced wad-
leigh to the savant volubly explaining
everything that had transpired

  then-this-this-means that you
-you-you wont marry-to-night
his statement was more a question

  mr wadleigh marries elaine to-
night i said smilingly although my
heart was leaden

  then mr gray said dr dale
you must stay in cape town never
while you and wadleigh live in this un-
canny plural estate should you sepa-
rate for any distance that will mean day
for one and night for the other
otherwise- he winked signifi-
cantly as he paused but neither wad-
leigh nor i could get his drift

  otherwise i asked

  mrs w adleigh-to-be will have two
no

tales of the double man

husbands-and that wouldnt be quite
proper would it 

  i stared then realized so did wad-
leigh

  doc is right said wadleigh wear-
ily but how can i expect mr gray
to be so generous

  deprived of elaine my heart was
yearning for good old new york this
city of cape town suddenly had be-
come hateful to me but-wadleigh
had been cruelly dealt with i could
not resist the urge of his sorrow-
stricken eyes

  ill stay here-until the link of
destiny is broken i said slowly god
grant it be broken soon or we shall
both go mad-again

  well interrupted doctor dale on
the sudden silence which had fallen
upon us after my fervent prayer now
that this is settled-let us eat

  despite his long burial wadleigh
was not voracious doctor dale was
quite curious concerning the emptying
of the thermos bottles left filled with
food in wadleighs tomb

  did you eat that liquid food we left
for you he asked or dont you
remember 

  i have a hazy recollection only of
having left my casket gone to the
thermos bottles and eaten the food
said wadleigh

  why return to the casket

  some force beyond my control
seemed to urge me back into it

  very strange-strange indeed 
exclaimed doctor dale what was
the sensation like

  as though something or some one
were pulling me it seemed as though
i were subconsciously informed that un-
less i did lie in the casket i actually
would die

  auto-suggestion most probably
imittered doctor dale

  wadleigh glanced at the clock on his
mantle

  i must go gendemen he said
rising

  go where i asked

  to the london ivory company
 

  sit down mr wadleigh said doc-
tor dale kindly do you know how
long you were unconscious

  wadleigh shook his head

  nine weeks exclaimed the scien-
tist plenty of time then for the of-
fice-after your honeymoon run over
and see elaine gray and i are going
-to doctor spauldings house again
gray must disguise elaine must not
know-until you both are out of this
occult bondage and actually are your-
selves again good-by wadleigh-a
happy honeymoon

  and i wish the same added i
with hand outstretched

  wadleigh clasped it tightly it was
the first time our physical beings had
come into actual contact both of us
thrilled weirdly actually it seemed
we were shaking hands with ourselves
rather than with one another

  god bless you gray said wad-
leigh fervently

  doctor dale and i had risen all
our effects were in the home of doctor
spaulding save a few odds and ends
which we could take away later we
moved toward the door wadleigh fol-
lowing my head was in a whirl it
was as though my physical shadow
were following me a fleshful shadow
exact in color height stride and voice
to myself

  on the veranda i turned to wad-
leigh

  good-by i said and walked with
doctor dale down the broad steps

  arthur wadleigh was married that
night he and his bride still are enjoy-
ing their honeymoon somewhere in
natal

  w ill elaine ever leam the weird cir-
cumstances that brought her a husband
from the tomb of death  i wonder

chapter iii

thornton was awakened from
troubled disturbing dreams next
morning by a chinese boy at his
bedside with tea which was so the lad
informed him sweet as a sparrows
tongue he noted that the porcelain
had a painting of the god of longevity
on it so that he was able to drink to
his own long life never before had
this compliment been made him

when he went later into the hotel
lobby he was instantly aware of the

changed attitude of the management
where had been of late suspicion and
inattention to his modest wants was
now a servile readiness to do his bid-
ding

  thornton knew perfectly well that it
was mr wangs money which had
brought about the grateful change but
what was it done for how could he
john thornton of new york help mr
wang of peking and why had
wang spoken of others thornton
shrugged his shoulders sufficient to


the terror of the rats

the day was the evil thereof two
nights hence at the inn of tatung he
would know

  meanwhile he was far more inter-
ested in trying to meet the pretty amer-
ican girl why had he not obtained
her business and home address as he
waited for a long procession of tiled
carts rickshas and stout gentlemen
astride of small donkeys to pass by he
thought how strange it was that a girl of
his own race should be here among the
mysteries of this ancient walled city
what had an american girl in common
with these subtle secretive yellow peo-
ple  he looked up to see a caravan of
camels swinging by with long slow
stately strides tall heavy-coated cam-
els newly come from the wastes of
mongolia and manchuria he was con-
scious that he and this girl he had saved
from robbers were of another nation
and civilization sandgate had spoken
once in his detached slow manner of
the awakening of china to her own
great destinies and the growing impa-
tience at the presence of the despised
foreigners sandgate had told thorn-
ton that every uprising insurrection or
rebellion aimed at the foreigner had
sprung into being without any warning
the europeans or british could sense
beforehand diplomats and consuls
were and always would be unable to
know what was really going on around
them

  thornton found himself constantly
thinking of pretty joan carrington he
had never been so obsessed with
thoughts of a girl before he was pop-
ular with women and had passed
through the many flirtations insepara-
ble from the college life of a good-lbok-
ing american with no haunting memo-
ries this was different there was a
protective sense aroused in him when
he thought how she had lain pale and
trembling in his arms when the robbers
had been put to rout and she had
pluck too instead of fainting as

many might she told him only that she
was angry

  he remembered she said she was
working for a firm which was german
that was nothing in the east where
british influence had always welcomed
them and even helped them to estab-
lish their markets peking was sure to
be full of german concessionaires
from the american consulate he might
find word of the girl if he could satisfy
the official he was a reputable citizen
there was the rub the official might
look on him coldly

  in the end jack thornton determined
to put off investigations until he had
met wang and wangs friends at ta-
tung and learned what they needed of
him he could not help being uneasy
at the thought of their possible de-
mands he was not fool enough to
suppose they wanted to meet him so-
cially it had been at considerable ex-
pense that they imported him

  it was while he was wandering about
the city pondering on the problem of
the suave wang that he was brought
to realize the importance of the man
by this time the american was accus-
tomed to the street sights of peking
he knew for example that when man-
darins went about they no longer used
the sedan chair of other days man-
darins had taken instead to riding in
english carriages of the brougham or
victoria type glass inclosed and re-
moved from the rabble of the streets
but no mandarin would be content to
be accompanied merely by his coach-
man each man of position must have
his mounted escorts in their pictur-
esque long riding garments round hats
and trailing scarlet feathers

  it was in such a carriage attended
by such an escort that thornton sud-
denly came face to face with the man
he had first met in the lobby of a new
york theater the dress in which mr
wang made his nocturnal visit to the
hotel de pekin was that of an affluent
the terror of the rats



man to-day wang wore gorgeous rai-
ment and was borne through the streets
looking neither to the left nor right
for the first time thornton was assured
that wang was of the powerful

  it was dusk when the american en-
tered the inn of tatung the propri-
etor welcomed him courteously hoping
that he might be full as a peony
thornton had never before been so far
from peking and looked with interest
on the room into which he was shown
and the curious scribblings on the wall
the longest of these screeds had been
written by some previous occupant
enter your name here said the joc-
ular traveler for the competition as
to which guest has risen with the most
flea or bug bites

  it was quite dark when the host led
him to a big bare room in it were
three chinese gentlemen mr wang
no longer gorgeous in mandarin robes
but clad as he had been when he called
at the hotel de pekin bowed gravely

  this is what you must do mr
wang began

  must do thornton repeated
frowning a little

  must do said wang again you
cannot fail to realize that you have
taken our money when you were at the
gate of lost hope as an honorable
gentleman the son of an honorable
father you understand well what you
did to take money and offer no re-
turn for it is not the act of one whose
ancestors are distinguished it is the
act of those who will kou luri and hold
out empty hands for gifts i found
you when you had nothing i exact
a task of you when it is accomplished
you may return to your land and glad-
den your fathers heart

  you dont know my father thorn-
ton said frowning

  i know the heart of all fathers
wang assured him impressively i
know that when you return and show
sathrill

him you are worthy to be his son he
will embrace you

  that may be muttered thornton
gazing at wangs impressive and silent
countrymen but how is it to be done 
when you do as we bid the way
will be clear listen well to me mr
thornton i brought you here not by
chance i have made diligent inquiry
into your life history i know wherein
you are weak and where you are strong
it is through your weakness we are
able to benefit by your strength you
fell from a high position because plans
of the railroad to be built from peking
to lanchow were stolen from your cus-
tody

  i wish i knew who did it said
thornton gloomily

  he is here in peking wang said
solemnly be calm without me you
cannot clear yourself

  ill do anything short of murder to
get the chance thornton cried eagerly
who is it

   there are some  wang said di-
dactically  so bad that their sins pickle
and confirm them in evil instead of rot-
ting them 

  he turned to his two countrymen
and spoke they made regal graceful
gestures and spoke in their melodious
pekingese phrases then wang turned
to the american and began his expla-
nations perhaps he consumed an hour
in the recital in the beginning he told
the younger man something of the con-
ditions of modern china

  it was the first time since thornton
had known wang that he saw him
moved out of his calm smileless ways
foreign concession hunters whether
german british or americans he de-
clared were the curse of china more
than anything such men kept her back
when it was the national will to pro-
gress

  taking advantage of the rottenness
of the administration these concession
hunters bribed mandarins to introduce


the terror of the rats

them to ministers of state and thus
force on an unwilling people loans
grants and monopolies

  this railroad scheme was a case in
point a german-american syndicate
was determined to build it when china
was perfectly well able to do so herself
wang pointed out the recently opened
road between peking and nankou
this road was built by chinese capital
and labor and the two head engineers
chinese both were graduates of yale
and london

  i was attorney for that proposed
road thornton said dryly

  that is why you are here wang
said significantly before i tell you
any more you must swear by what you
hold sacred that you will not betray us
i will tell you first that we only want
for our country what your fathers won
for america-liberty

  am i betraying my own people
thornton demanded

  you will be asked to aid in the pun-
ishment of an american citizen he
was told but it will help to cleanse
your conscience more than that it
will help to redeem your own good
name

  as he listened thornton learned
what few foreigners ever do he lis-
tened to a man high in the councils of
a great secret society whose only aim
was to give china back to the chinese
he was told of the society in tientsin
which foreigners know as the society
of the red door but whose real name
is the society which meets injury
with retaliations it was this society
which had determined to drive out the
accursed blood-sucking concessionaires

  wang was the head of the most
powerful branches of the new china
party he had at his command re-
sources almost limitless entranced
the american listened to those great
societies of resolute men of which the
west rarely learns

  he was told of the sam hop hui

and the master of the red stick who
rules them and the dread powers of
the society of the sword

  sometimes these societies like the
american ku-klux-klan pursued pri-
vate enmities but in the main they ex-
isted for that distant day when china
would be free from foreigners and re-
spected of the world

  where do i come in thornton
asked when the other had done

  from to-night wang said rapidly
you are george fallon you gradu-
ated from the law school of columbia
university in  you are an unmar-
ried orphan born in east boston your
training in boston and new york has
been with politicians mainly you have
handled corruption funds with such
skill that you have nothing to fear from
the police you have come to peking
to be confidential secretary to adolf
jaeckels you were engaged by wil-
liam jaeckels at the request of his
brother

  fine gasped thornton but as
there is a real george i suppose where
is he

  wang shook his head there was
sympathy in his voice

   as typhoons sweep the bamboos
sprays so death blew up his sleeve 

  it was plain to the american that
this george fallon had not been re-
moved idly he was by this time thor-
oughly impressed by the organization
which had mapped this one of myriad
details with such freedom from failure
it was an uncomforting thought that
unless he did what he was bidden some
swift noiseless fate might deal as ruth-
lessly with him as with fallon

  after all he was here alone and un-
heralded in a strange and unfriendly
land in america none knew of his
coming and none cared

  if adolf jaeckels who isnt a fool
i assume engaged this man he had ref-
erences and something to go by

  you will find george fallons bag-
the terror of the rats

us

gage and references awaiting you in
the house of a respectable scotch
widow where rooms have been re-
served for you copies of the corre-
spondence between the brothers jaeck-
els relative to you your ability and the
like are there too

  suppose i fall down thornton de-
manded i dont know a thing about
east boston

  you must not make any mistake
wang said suavely you will make
nightly reports to me and receive every
aid

  it seems very strange to me
thornton commented that a lawyer in
politics in new york should want to
take a job out here you say the police
had nothing on him

  wang understood the american id-
iom perfectly

  george fallon was mixed up in an
unsavory case which concerned a
wdman in a year or so he planned to
return when the matter was forgotten
it was at the suggestion of his friends
he accepted this opportunity

  im understudying a scoundrel
then 

  a scoundrel working for a greater
one wang admitted we know that
jaeckels is bribing certain of our coun-
trymen here he keeps no memoranda
of such corruption we know for we
have searched his office it is too vast
a business for one man

  he needed such a one as fallon who
was greedy for money skilled in dou-
ble-dealing and anxious to be away
from his countrys jurisdiction it will
be your part to tell us with whom this

jaeckels deals when we know all-

he made an eloquently expressive ges-
tute thornton remembered the simile
of the typhoon and the bamboo sprays

  but his spirits rose it was work he
could do without feeling ashamed and
wang had hinted there was a reward
in sight which might again allow him
to stand before his fellows as an up-

right man he felt however it was
not politic to ask further

  its better than i thought thorn-
ton exclaimed brightly im ready to
begin at once where shall i see you
to make my report

  that you will never know wang
told him perhaps in your office per-
haps as you walk the city streets per-
haps as you awake from sleep and think
yourself alone make no confidants
play your part with skill forget you
ever were named thornton

chapter iv

rs hamilton in whose home
thornton was to spend many
months was not inquisitive he often
suspected her house had been chosen
for just such a reason when he ar-
rived he was conducted to a room in
which george fallons baggage was
neatly arranged

  for long hours that first night he
read through the private memoranda of
that adroit schemer that death had
blown up his sleeves seemed an equi-
table action and there were some let-
ters from a dead wofhan which would
have brought bitter shame to any man
but they had been flippantly penciled
by the one who had thought to escape

  thornton read william jaeckels
comments on george fallon with
amusement and eagerness

  this fellow is about as slick as they
make them wrote william a good
mixer a hard drinker and almost as
selfish as you are i have told him
that you may want things done in 
manner which would be outside the law
here but is all right in that god-for-
saken land where hes going

  he says if any yellow man can put
over anything on him hell take out his
papers and sprout a pigtail we can
use this fellow adolf but see he com-
promises himself hell have to read
up international and company law when
ii

the terror of the rats

you get him all hes done of late is
to get thugs acquitted and get bail for
crooks his use to us is the knowledge
of human nature he knows when and
how to buy a man its his job and
irom what you say we need to buy
yellow and white help if were going
to get that concession

  undoubtedly john thornton mem-
ber of an honorable family and decent
beliefs was engaged to understudy a
very undesirable citizen ordinarily he
would by this time have been worrying
as to when and how he was to get to
jaeckels office but he was learning
that his moves were mapped by other
wills than his own

  he had been two days at the widow
hamiltons house during which he had
learned a great deal of fallons past
when a letter was brought in it was
only an unsigned note to say that he
was expected at the jaeckels office
near the ketteler monument in ha-ta
men street at ten-thirty next day

  thornton had never kept an appoint-
ment with such vivid eagerness as this
the more he thought over the thing the
more he liked the prospect of outwit-
ting the monopoly-grabbing jaeckels
he was shown into a big office there
was a large table evidently jdeckels
and a smaller one which was later his

  an immensely fat florid man in
white drill was dictating to a slim dark
girl also in white as the american
stood in the doorway either unheard or
unheeded jaeckels put a fat hot hand
on the girls arm the american could
see a shiver of disgust at the contact
but she kept on filling her notebook

  then the fat man looked up

  come in fallon what sort of a
trip did you have and what do you
think of this cursed place

  thornton could not get a glance at
the girl who hurried off but the fig-
ure was so like that of the one who
had filled his thoughts that he started
to follow her he was brought to his

senses by the tug at his sleeve the
big fat man was chuckling he had
a curious thick way of talking and he
licked his lips a great deal

  now now he admonished mirth-
fully not so fast shes mine you
can spend your evenings at the circus
barowsky or the arcade but leave my
little plum blossom to me jaeckels
was still amiable but the threat in his
voice was unmistakable t should
have thought youd had enough of em
after your little experiences

  it seems so strange to see an amer-
ican girl here thornton answered
he was confused and irritated at the
thought that here in his private office
with a man like adolf jaeckels a de-
cent-minded american girl might have
to pass her days

  it was joan carrington

  when he went to her side after a
long talk with their common employer
he saw the sweet face that had haunted
him she was vexed with herself later
for showing him so obviously that she
was glad to see him but she could
not help it

  life pressed on her very hardly and
the passage back to her own country
was difficult to save her little hoard
had been expended a few months be-
fore when she had been operated on
for appendicitis

  her every working moment was filled
with dread of jaeckels although he
was an american citizen he openly
sneered at his adopted country and
lauded that of his birth to the skies
that had been bad enough but of late
he had taken to touching her hand and
arm as she took his dictation

  it seemed like the coming of new
life and hope to know that her rescuer
was to sit in the big room and share
her labors surely the presence of a
man such as this mr fallon must keep
jaeckels within bounds for a time
at any rate it did

  jaeckels was above all a business
the terror of the rats

ii 

man at last he was able to talk openly
frankly cynically about his schemes to

as complete a crook as himself or his
brother he needed to be advised of
american law at this thornton was
infinitely the superior of the man he
understudied he had been for a year
in the office of the district attorney and
the cases of get-rich-quick swindlers
had given him a deep knowledge of
their methods jaeckels listened with
rapt attention

  but we can do better here in asia
he repeated again and again stick
to me george and be loyal and youll
make more than the big fellows ever
would give you in manhattan my
brother williams a british subject
he left london because new york
offered him better pickings let me
tell you this hes leaving new york
for peking thats what he thinks of
our prospects

 when the other demanded
quickly it would not be a happy meet-
mg

  in a couple of months adolf said

  ive not seen any pickings thorn-
ton said after a pause of sheer relief

  ive been trying you out jaeckels
confided in him i cant afford to
make any mistakes my god man
you dont know whats here for us
when i first came here i read some-
thing sir robert hart head of the cus-
toms said about the land tax he said
it yielded twenty-five million when it
should bring in if it were properly
managed four hundred million

  jaeckels made the motion of one
squeezing something dry we mut
squeeze them scientifically you and
i cant do it alone we must stand in
with some of the officials they get
it principally by entering payments
twice and padding the pay roll but ive
got something up my sleeve that beats
it all

  listen i know a minister of the
nung kung shang pu-thats the min-

istry of agriculture industry and trade
-and that ought to be worth five mil-
lions in concessions if its worked right
now im not popular here although
im an american citizen theyve got
nothing against me that could be put
in writing but-

 there was an eloquent pause
thornton said nothing

  youre a newcomer jaeckels went
on and not mixed up in pekingese
affairs what you have to do is to float
around and spend money at the peking
club and get favorably known ill put
up the money ill see that you are
introduced as the son of a rich friend
who is sending you out here to get the
edges rubbed off dont talk about
business the social end of it for you
above all do as i say if you dont
back you go

  that sounds like a threat thorn-
ton observed without smiling

  thats just what it is jaeckels
smiled lets understand each other
fallon you think just because i weigh
three hundred pounds and look soft
physically im soft mentally im not
im hard im unforgiving i never
forget an injury im a bad man to
cross then he smiled engagingly
on the other hand if a mans faithful
and loyal i see he is rewarded you
understand 

  absolutely said thornton briskly
you want me to piay the social end
of the game so i can lead them to your
web all right when do i begin

  it was hard work fr a decent man
to play his part with so complete a vil-
lain as adolf jaeckels hardly an
hour of the day or night went by but
jack thornton was tempted to throw
up the position but he held himself
in for the reason that so much depended
on it

  some time during the twenty-four
hours he made his report to wang it
seemed he was doing well for the man-
x

the terror op the rats

darin praised his activity and promised
bim ere long the possession of facts
which would clear him

  what made life bearable was the
companionship of joan carrington
often when jaeckels believed him to
be watching the ballet at the circus
barowsky or wooing fickle chance at
one of the gambling houses in tele-
graph lane thornton was with her

  he knew without any possibility of
mistake that this was the great passion
of his life and because he wanted to
offer himself freed from all shadows
of suspicion he did not tell her how
much he loved her had she but known
it this hesitation was his sincerest trib-
ute it was because she loved him un-
reservedly and with a strength of devo-
tion that almost frightened her that she
found it incomprehensible that he
looked so much and said so little

  jaeckels was growing more offensive
every day it would have been so sim-
ple to tell him she and george fallon
were engaged one day her employer
casting discretion to the winds poured
out his passion for her

  i love you i love you he cried
thickly

  thats nonsense she said spring-
ing to her feet you mustnt say that

  why not  he demanded is there
any other man

  her crimsoned cheek gave him an-
swer his evil eyes glittered like beads
of blue glass instantly he suspected
this handsome young american

  george he--called loudly come
here

  thornton strolled in leisurely he
could see something had happened to
distress the girl he loved what is
it he asked

  have you been making love to miss
carrington if you have youd better
cut it out this is a business organiza-
tion and i wont have it

  joan carringtons heart beat quickly
if she knew the high spirit and genuine

nature of the man she loved this was
the moment for him to put jaeckels in
hrs place

  for the moment thornton could
scarcely contain himself he could see
what had happened the jealous intui-
tion of the lover told him that but he
dared not risk a quarrel yet not an
hour before his employer had outlined
a scheme at once so boldly criminal that
its complete possession would enable
him to tell wang all that the high-born
chinaman wanted to know

  it was now a matter of hours in
a day or two at the most he would be
able to shake himself free from bond-
age and get back to his own country
with joan and honor it was damnable
that this thing should have happened
at such a moment to run with the
hare and hunt with the hounds has ever
been a difficult proceeding he wished
he had dared take the girl into his con-
fidence but wang had been adamant
when he spoke he felt his voice ring
false

  what fool idea have you got in your
head  he demanded lightly

  pm telling you retorted jaeckels
venomously to keep your hands off
joan carrington

  forget it said thornton i want
to talk to you further about that matter
we discussed earlier

  his heart seemed to turn to water
as he saw the pale girl shrink back as
from a blow he knew she must feel
as csesar did when wounded by the
dagger of brutus

  i wont forget it jaeckels ex-
claimed before i talk business to you
or allow you to be here do you under-
stand what i mean if you dont ill
repeat it you are not to have any-
thing to do with this girl except in a
purely business manner you go your
way when youre through here and
shell go hers if you either of you
disobey me you can get out do you
agree to that mr george fallon
the terror of the rats

u

  thornton dared not look at joan he
knew if he did his resolve would
weaken if only she could understand
that this seeming treachery was being
enacted for her benefit as well as his
own

  the girl was young friendless and
inexperienced she saw only that the
man she had idealized was after all
a poor creature trembling before the
wrath of his employer wrhen love
should have lent him strength he be-
trayed only weakness she turned her
head away so that none should see the
tears which forced themselves past the
gates of her eyes

  all right said thornton briefly
i see

  and youll do as i say

  yes he said sullenly

  adolf jaeckels turned his attention
to the girl

  your heros got a bright yellow
streak where his backbone ought to be
he sneered i wouldnt worry about
him any more

  by a supreme effort she forced her
voice to be firm

  i wont she replied and walked
from the room

  jaeckels was still sneering when he
spoke to the other man

  i understand the temptation all
right he observed but this is where
you keep off the grass i never warn
a subordinate twice

  before she went home that night
jaeckels threw a newspaper clipping on
the desk it was from a sensational
new york yellow journal and shrieked
unsavory details at her concerning one
george fallon

  when youve read that youll be
grateful to me said adolf

  later she gave it back to him she
looked very white and broken all the
happy youth blotted from her face in
a few hours of a working day

  i am grateful she said huskily

  outside the office on ha-ta men

street thornton despite his resolve to
wait until all was cleared up came to
her side

  all i ask he whispered is that
you suspend judgment dont condemn
me-yet

  i hate you she said flushing i
shall never cease to be ashamed at hav-
ing known you i shall never cease
praying to forget you utterly

  from his window adolf jaeckels ob-
served what happened he chuckled
there had been many opportunities in
his life to study feminine psychology
he was more amiable to thornton now
he had witnessed his rebuff he even
offered the younger man one of his best
cigars as he talked over the secret mat-
ter concerning the bribing of a high
official

  if we dont get it some one else
will jaeckels said when the scheme
was outlined its up to us white men
to make hay before the japs get into
the game when they do we wont get
a look-in

  it was less than a wreek after thorn-
tons humiliation that his employer
came to him in high good humor his
brother william had placed to his credit
at the peking branch of the anglo-
japanese bank a half million of dollars
with this sum as a bait the brothers
jaeckels hoped to make themselves fab-
ulously wealthy

  the first move in the game was a
visit one night to the house of a china-
man of position where would be gath-
ered other native notables jack
thornton noted that although the misty
night made recognition of streets diffi-
cult jaeckels deliberately mystified him
by crossing his tracks and recrossing
them

  spare yourself the trouble thorn-
ton said ive no idea where we are
i couldnt identify anything

  its not for you im doing this


the terror of the rats

the other whispered its because
others may be interested too

  it was a rich mans house that they
presently entered there was the
chapel for ancestral tablets and the spa-
ciousness of the cleanly bare rooms was
impressive in the great hall four chi-
nese gentlemen were sitting at the teak
guest table under a long confucian
motto through an opening thornton
could see the central court with its pond
for brilliant fish

  he looked at the impassive faces of
the men with interest

  they made none of the courteous
gestures of welcome which such men
would do to those of their own rank
or guests whom they considered worthy
of honor perhaps jaeckels saw that
his assistant noted this

  they think about as much of us
as they do of actors he whispered
thornton knew that the brothers of
the pear tree as thespians are termed
rank with keepers of opium dens and
are denied social recognition he felt
humiliated at being associated with the
perspiring blond man

  it is almost impossible to hurry chi-
nese of rank only one admitted know-
ing english and his translations took
an enormous time three hours were
consumed in learning that for the con-
sideration of a sum yet to be decided
the concession jaeckels sought would
be his it was complete victory

  money was waiting at the bank
george fallon was at hand to distribute
it with craft and his brother william
would shortly be with him william
who was his superior even in ways of
guile

  that night thornton could not go to
sleep for thinking of the information
he had for wang on his way back
to jaeckels home he had tnemorized
the names and positions of the four
officials they were all of importance
and none had been suspected by the
vcw china party

  when wang heard the last name of
the four mentioned his bands so long
and motionless were suddenly turned
into clenched fists thornton would
not know that one of the guilty on
whom the seal of death was now irrev-
ocably set was his own brother

  you have done well said wang
you have accomplished that for which
we brought you

  thornton looked at him with the deep
interest he ever felt toward this re-
markable inflexible passionless man
he would like to have asked more of
the methods by which the corrupt offi-
cials were to be punished

  shall i have to appear in a court
of justice to give my testimony

   litigation  quoted wang  is
suing a flea and getting a bite for jus-
tice no we shall deal with them
more swiftly than that to-morrow
night i shall be here again

  silently he slipped from the bedroom
mysterious in his comings and his go-
ings

  jaeckels was very busy next day
for the greater part of the time thorn-
ton was obliged to remain in the outer
office with joan half a dozen times
he made an effort to talk to her but
her haughty way of holding her head
made him desist

  presently her attitude ceased to hurt
him after all this was the way a
decent girl ought to behave to a man
with fallons record how was she to
know the substitution

  he paused by the side of her desk
im going to marry you he as-
serted and youre going to be per-
fectly happy

  smilelessly she pointed to the inner
office

  if he hears you she sneered he
may come out and box your ears

  so he might thornton agreed still
smiling but then again he might not
listen to me joan carrington be-
fore i marry you pm going to offer
the terror of the rats



you the spectacle of seeing him soundly
whipped

  whom will you hire to do it she
demanded

  ive engaged myself in the star
role

  she turned her head away and went
on typewriting she had been sobbing
herself to sleep for a week now with
a heart that she thought was breaking
she could never be happy again she
told herself

  jaeckels had a big roomy house near
the chien men gate men who were
willing to meet him at poker were wel-
comed and the stakes were high
there too were dancing girls from
barowskys and champagne suppers on
great occasions jaeckels had often
talked of this place to his assistant but
so far had never invited him there

  youd better see it before i have to
give it up he remarked my brother
is higher-toned than i am he wouldnt
stand for this place he wants to make
a splash in society i like my house
because no european or american ever
comes near it unless invited id like
you to come to-night fallon

  some other night said thornton
im tired

  jaeckels winked ponderously

  its business he said significantly
ive had a message from one of the
bunch and terms are to be discussed
youve got to be on hand its mighty
important you have to get there early
remember when its all settled your
place in the game is to be taken into
consideration youve got to collect for
me just as you did for your political
boss at home only youve got to be a
dashed sight slicker if they get on
to you ill have to get another helper
you wont need one said thorn-
ton in a tone that jaeckels did not like
if they get me they get you

  do they said the elder man and
instantly set about wondering where a
new assistant might be obtained

  he knew there was more danger in
the undertaking than there used to be
the mighty nation had been used to
systematic graft for a score of centu-
ries but was now suddenly awaking to
a new consciousness

chapter v

qeated at her desk late that eve-
ning joan carrington was startled
by a knock upon the sliding door open-
ing from the corridor before she
could rise it had been pushed back and
a man slipped in furtively

  he was above middle height broad
and bullet-headed and joan thought
that never had she looked into such a
hateful face

  quickly she took from the drawer of
her desk a revolver that had been her
fathers and hid it in a pocket

  what do you want she asked
sharply

  mr jaeckels he said he spoke
with a common intonation and his
small dark eyes roved from comer to
corner as though fearing detection

  mr jaeckels has gone home she
said he wont be here until ten to-
morrow morning he lives on chien
men street

  the man was evidently a sailor on
some american ship at tientsin
jaeckels often bought things from such
men stolen goods perhaps but always
at a bargain but no sailor had ever
made so free with mr jaeckels office
the man sat himself down in the vast
chair and took from his pocket a flask
and held it to his lips

  samschu isnt so bad when theres
nothing else he observed he looked
about him with interest you the
stenographer

  im mr jaeckels secretary she an-
swered

  well get along fine said the sailor
i didnt know i was going to be so
luckv 


the terror of the rats

  this office is closed she said
firmly and will not be open till to-
morrow

  you evidently dont know who i
am he said faintly amused why
little one fm george fallon if that
means anything to you

  you are certainly not george fal-
lon she cried

  thought i was killed i suppose
he said smiling well little one they
had a tougher proposition on hand than
they thought when i got to hong-
kong i was invited to go out and sit
in a friendly game over at kowloon
city it was a friendly game all right
over the entrance it said auspicious
welcome 

  the man who styled himself george
fallon suddenly woke to ferocious an-
ger my god when i think of what
i suffered after i was left for dead i
feel like killing every chink on sight
some day ill tell you about it he
looked at her curiously why did you
say i wasnt george fallon

  because mr fallon is working here
and has been for two months or more
hes at mr jaeckels house now i
heard mr jaeckels ask him to go

   so startled was the girl at his flaming
face when he heard this that she
jumped up with a scream and the re-
volver fell to the floor in a second
he had pounced on it

   i needed that he said writh an oath
so theres some man here masquerad-
ing as me eh if there is its the man
who tried to have me put out of the
way i see it now he broke the re-
volver and looked eagerly to see if
it was fully loaded six of em he
muttered he stands a swell chance
of being able to pull that game again
so dazed was the girl with the be-
wildering emotions of the moment that
at first she could not comprehend her
changed situation if this coarse-faced
man were indeed george fallon then
the man she loved must bear another

name and another past those loath-
some revelations in the paper were not
true of him she had condemned him
for anothers fault fallon watching
her alert for trickery and suspicious
of every one could not understand

  take me to jaeckels house he
commanded

  i will not she said what treach-
ery could be baser than to lead this
armed violent creature to attack his
fellow countryman

  you will he said or fll raise such
hell that youll be sorry whats it to
be

  she looked at the clock and saw that
it was yet early it might be that the
man she loved had not yet started from
mrs hamiltons house if only she
could take this new fallon to chien
men street and then warn the other
she did not trouble to seek explanations
the newcomer was plainly puzzled by
her readiness to what a moment before
she had refused

  i dont trust you he said frown-
ing and i serve notice on you im
sore with everything in this damn coun-
try dont try any tricks

  i wont she said quickly i prom-
ise to take you to mr jaeckels

  all right he returned more amia-
bly thats all i want to begin with
if any one has been double-crossing me
its this fellow who calls himself by
my name and i cant find him too
quickly

  it was the first time joan had ever
been to her employers residence he
had often hinted that he would like her
to come but she had never shown any
eagerness reports were rife of the
type of gathering that met there when
the real george fallon entered she
slipped back into the street and made
her way to mrs hamiltons home hop-
ing to see the tall straight figure of
the man she had wronged

  she did not relish this visit because
the scots lady had rigid ideas about
the terror of the rats



the proprieties and it was now ten
oclock and the place in darkness
looking up joan saw there was one
light left in a room and as she looked
a mans form passed between the lamp
and shade

  it could be none other than the man
she had come to see it was not difficult
for one as slight and wiry as she to
pull herself up to the balcony beneath
the lighted window as she did so the
lamp was extinguished she rapped
gently against the shutter but no one
came to investigate the sound then
nerved by the necessity of seeing him
joan pushed the window open and
stepped down into the room

  as she stood there hesitating some-
thing passed silently behind her and
closed the shutters then the lamp was
turned up and she found herself look-
ing into the impassive face of a chinese
gentleman in his less obvious way he
seemed as much surprised as she was

  dont scream he said in english
as correct as her own i shall do you
no harm

  wheres mr fallon  she cried i
must see him

  i too am awaiting him the un-
known returned

  how long have you been here she
asked

  when he told her he had waited more
than an hour she groaned

  its too late she wailed theyve
got him now

  the chinaman woke to vivid inter-
est

  you must tell me what you mean
at once

  directly he had heard of the coming
of the real george fallon and the meet-
ing at jaeckels house he made for the
window first he extinguished the
lamp the girl had determined that he
was a man to be trusted he had given
her the impression of strength and
courage with the certainty that in

obeying him she was attempting to aid
her fellow countryman she followed
wang

chapter vi

hen thornton left mrs hamil-
f tons he thought he had memo-
rized the way to jaeckels house accu-
rately but it was night and he lost
his way and wandered in strange by-
ways for an hour before he turned into
chien men street and paused before
his employers home

  he was instantly admitted and
found himself very soon facing the chi-
namen in a luxurious gorgeously fur-
nished room it was a miracle of bad
taste in a country of exquisite furnish-
ings-exactly like jaeckels he com-
mented

  jaeckels looked at him curiously
there was an expression of triumph
thornton thought evidently things
were breaking right with him

  youre late jaeckels said

  lost my way thornton responded
and looked at the four men of high de-
gree

  they had cruel faces he thought
hard impassive masks that concealed
god knew what immemorial vices and
they were content to betray their coun-
trymen for filthy lucre it was done
everywhere he supposed in west and
east but thornton was essentially hon-
est and hated graft

  the next move on jaeckels part as-
tounded him the huge fat man took
an automatic pistol from his pocket and
handled it lovingly

  i cannot run said jaeckels but i
can shoot with any man in china

  for the first time thornton awoke to
danger in the almond eyes of these
silent pekingese magnates he sensed bit-
ter hate there was a tenseness in the
situation that spoke of imminent peril
as the door was shut and he was cov-
ered by a loaded pistol and outnum-
bered five to one any attempt at es-


the terror of the rats

cape was impossible he tried to pass
it off easily

  i cannot shoot worth a damn he
answered carelessely but i can run
against any man in china

  youll never get a chance to prove
it sneered jaeckels youve run your
last race mr george fallon and
youve lost

  what the devil are you talking
about  thornton demanded he
wanted to know instantly this fenc-
ing got on his nerves

  in answer a fierce-eyed man dressed
like a sailor came into the room if
the others showed their dislike of
thornton this mans glance shouted it
he clenched his fists and made as
though to spring at him

  not yet jaeckels said sharply

  if hes spoiling for a fight said
thornton his spirits rising at the pros-
pects of action let him have it turn
that damned gun away and let him see
what he can do

  you keep where you are the fat
man commanded meanwhile let me
introduce you to mr george fallon
thornton looked at him with interest
those watching him were disappointed
to see no sign of fear on his face

  so youre the real fallon he com-
mented from your press notices i
can believe it

  he hoped the real fallon would make
a rush at him in a rough and tumble
there might be a chance at escape
which this hungry gun muzzle pre-
vented

  not very careful of his personal
appearance is he thornton ex-
claimed pleasantly has an air of the
salt sea about him i dont think hell
be a credit to the old firm hes hun-
gry adolf look at him licking his
lips feed the brute

  wait a minute jaeckels cried as
the stranger tried to make a lunge at
his impersonator right now we
want to know how he did it

  did what thornton asked
changed places with this man and
had him almost killed in a kowloon
city gambling hell

  they probably caught him cheat-
ing thornton explained look at
his blushing face he admits it
cut that out jaeckels exclaimed
angrily havent you enough sense
to see that youre up against it if i
were willing to let you go fallon here
would want to get at you

  hell never forget me when im
through said fallon

 and if fallon were merciful-
which he isnt-youve got to reckon
with that bunch there he indicated
the chinamen of rank they can see
through your game you are not as
happy as you seem

  suddenly the chinaman who knew
english spoke it was inevitably a
mongolian maxim  antics are not
always vivacity as the fish on the hook
can say this man must tell every-
thing he knows unless he does we
leave here writh a poised sword over
our necks there are methods which
we know he permitted himself to
smile faintly methods which will
make him open his heart as a sick child
talks to his mother

  that means torture said fallon
vindictively torture that will break
down any mans nerves youve heard
of chinese torture havent you well
youre going to experience it tell me
how you trimmed me in kowloon

  if i knew i probably shouldnt tell
thornton returned and as i dont
know i cant tell

  he will tell you all the chinaman
said with conviction perhaps not at
first as he is strong and young but
later when the sinews stretch and the
nerves are plucked as one plucks the
strings of the lute he will answer your
every question

  still thornton said no word and gave
evidence of none of the creeping terror
the terror of the rats

that came to him they would torture
him to make him tell of what he did
not know there was such certainty
in the chinamans statement that he
would make a complete confession it
was built on countless centuries of ex-
perience with men just as strong of
muscle and stout of heart as he him-
self

  this then was the end to come
to shameful death in a far country his
relatives would believe him guilty
they would cease to talk of him and
think of him only with resentment
and little joan carrington would never
know that the love he offered her was
clean and fine and worthy of her

  these men were determined on his
death he could see that even if he
told them of wang they would not
believe that he did not know his real
name and that of his companions he
was as one already dead

  youd better beginv he said ive
nothing to say

  they bound him very tightly hand
and foot so cunningly were the bonds
fastened that agonizing cramps seized
him so that he could hardly keep from
calling out and this was not even
the beginning of the tortures that would
soon commence

  he heard them arguing as to what
place would be most secret and con-
venient jaeckels it seemed had little
appetite for watching the punishment
he proposed to leave it to the chinese
and george fallon it would upset his
stomach he explained the sight of
blood invariably destroyed his digestive
powers but he pointed out that there
was a vast cellar beneath the thick-
walled house from which all noise of
the outer world was shut off it was
full of rats

  the chinaman who spoke english
turned his slanting eyes on the bound
man

  that is well he said smoothly
we shall use them you have per-

haps he said to thornton read an
english book which spoke of the use
to which we put rats in our punish-
ments the writer knew so little if
you were to live you would be able
to teach him so much

  it was indeed a vast and horrid
chamber this dark and dreadful space
beneath the house they placed him
on a long table and he was only able
to look at the damp ceiling around
him he could hear the squealing of
frightened rats

  theyre catching em fallon ex-
plained coming to thorntons side
and putting em in a sack the chink
with the purple robe said he was glad
they were half starved

  fallon paused a moment im not
great on this torturing stuff but when
i think what you made me go through
down there in hongkong when you
tried to have me killed im not going
to waste any pity on you id rather
have beaten you up first but theyre
afraid fd kill you

  thornton even in that moment
could laugh but there was little genuine
mirth in it it was rather a last at-
tempt to provoke a fight wherein he
had a chance to escape

  oh no he explained they were
afraid you would get killed they
know very well you wouldnt last two
rounds with me youre wise to have
me tied up

  it was jaeckels who pulled fallon
away cursing and mouthing

  dont be a fool he counseled
watch your step here those chinks
can make or break us it depends what
this faker tells keep your temper
youre not in new york remember
im going before they begin

  before they began thornton heard
jaeckels retreating steps it must be
very near now he supposed

  a moment later he heard jaeckels-
from the top of the steps leaing to the


the terror of the rats

main floor he surmised-utter a furi-
ous oath then there was the sound
of many voices rising high in anger
or fear and the cellar was full of men
chinese all

  not a thing could he see but all about
him were wrestling fighting figures
now and again he heard the harsh
cough and indrawn breath which told
him that a life had gone out as cold
steel ran the body through above the
din he heard george fallons voice
then the harsh voice was stilled in the
cough and indrawn breath

  it was wang who cut his bonds

  when he stepped down from the
table there was a dreadful stillness in
the gloomy chamber fallon lay with
the four chinamen in the sprawling ug-
liness of violent death and two of
wangs men were dead it was a fear-
ful sight but it meant safety for him
half hysterically he told wang what
had happened of the torture threats of
jaeckels who could not bear to witness
the punishment in which he had con-
curred he wondered why it was mr
wang allowed himself that fleeting
smile

  he pointed to the sack in which a
score of hungry rats were fighting and
squealing

  it will perhaps appeal to mr
jaeckels sense of humor that they will
be his own rats who force the truth
from him

  so adolf jaeckels was to fail in the
pit he had digged for another thorn-
ton was wearied of this cruelty of the
mysteries of this old land to which he
was bound by no tie of race tongue
or tradition he longed to be among
a people he could understand

  my fathers house sounds pretty
good to me now he said

  it is well mr wang returned with
a smile of commendation you may
now go to him proudly as a son un-
ashamed and filial already he has
proofs of your innocence go and

may you be as wide as a chrysanthe-
mum border

  its not so easy to go he reminded
the mandarin

  that is provided for wang said
suavely the train to tientsin leaves
in one hour your ticket is already
purchased you will stay at the astor
house there until the boat leaves on
the next day you will be wise never
again to set foot in peking

  ui never will thornton assured
him am i to go back to my rooms
no said wang it will not be nec-
essary furthermore you will travel
to tientsin in native dress i have such
a costume here thereyou will be safe
if you keep within the astor house
also you will be wise to speak to none
wang handed a package to the ameri-
can here are your tickets booked
through to new york and money
which you have earned i shall never
see you again years fly like arrows
one eager to pass the other to the mark
you will be happy

  thats awfully good of you said
thornton but id like to see a friend
before i go

  miss carrington will be guarded
carefully said the amazing wang
she will be sent suitably protected to
her native land you must not for her
sake and your own venture near any
place where you are known now that
is why you are to wear this dress
everything went as wrang had said
rooms were reserved at tientsins best
hotel and he had in his possession
tickets for the mail steamer but what
puzzled thornton was to find on open-
ing the packet that there were three
passages booked an expensive way
of hiding his track if it were done for
that purpose

  after the breakfast taken in his
rooms next morning there was a
knock upon the door a soft timid
knock he had in his pocket the auto-
matic which had been jaeckels and he
the terror of the rats

gripped it although wang had said
little he knew that there might be dan-
ger still

  it was joan who came in

  you  he cried oh joan  then
he took her in his arms i said you
were going to marry me and be happy
ever afterward

  she told him that in an adjoining
room was old mrs hamilton engaged
by wang to chaperon her to new york
at a moments notice everything had
been arranged wang had power and
his name was magical he had bought
the scotchwomans home and she was
going back to her childhood home in
inverness

  its magical he confessed this
wang as he calls himself moves us like
pieces on a board and we dont know
yet what his real purpose is or what his
name is i wish i did

  you do joan said and whispered
in his ear the name of the greatest
power in all china

  its an honor to have been work-
ing for him he exclaimed but as its
finished with i have other important
things to do im not supposed to leave
this hotel till i make my run for the
steamer but you are a free agent
now sweetheart you must do some-
thing for me im anxious to have a
heart-to-heart talk with an american
preacher i have grave doctrinal
doubts which only a minister of religion
can solve

  she looked at him in amazement
his tone was grave and his face smile-
less had the horrors of which he
had just told her affected him mentally

 yes he went on i wish for
priestly consolation

  youre not ill she exclaimed

  he took her in his arms again and
covered her sweet face with kisses
all i want to know he whispered is
if theres anything in chinese law
against our being married before the
ship sails

the end

outside in the wind and the
rain and the darkness a man
looked through a window into
the light and warmth of a glowing
wood fire near which a woman was
getting supper his eyes followed her
about the plain bare little room and
not a movement escaped him

  a startling knock on the rough door
brought the woman at once she hesi-
tated a moment taking in the details
then stepped aside for him to enter
without a word he went to the fire
slipped off his wet coat and spread it
across a chair to dry

  its a wild night missus he said
as he seated himself on a low stool
before the blaze tough on a man
who has no home

  the wind is high she replied go-
ing on with her work

 the man appeared to be deep in
thought as he looked into the cheerful
fire he saw her cut the bread go to

the cupboard for a dish of cake patur
ing to rearrange a set of platters
against the rough back f the dresser
he heard a curious sound above the
rain and the wind a cry like that of
an animal in distress he saw her
listen hesitate then slip a coat around
her shoulders and go out into the dark-
ness

  when she returned he noticed that
the coat was gone she itood by the
fire and shaking the raindrops from
her dress explained that the wind had
torn it from her shculders

  husband coming soon the man
questioned

  the storm may detain him
pretty lonesome up here among the
hills

  yes

  live here all the time

  she gave him a searching look and
muttered something under her breath
as she turned to scald the tea
the kiss of the silver flask

  will you have some supper she
asked when the table was arranged to
her satisfaction

  the mans eyes sought and held hers
-his shrewd from long experience
hers defiant

  aint you afraid missus fm a
rough man

  why should i fear you  she asked
in a voice like steel i am prepared
to protect myself and her eyes fell
for a moment to the folds of her waist

  he made a mental note of it

  if you will give me a cup of tea
ill drink it here by the fire

  she did as requested and the tea
was so unusually good that he com-
mented upon it

  myour tea is good missus very
good

  how long have you been on the
road she asked

  a considerable time missus some-
times it pays and sometimes it dont

  why such a doubtful profession

  he put a question why do you
live up here among the hills

   i like it

  and i like the road

  which leads to prison

  i take a chance missus same as
you do in this lonely place

  how did you chance to find this
detached bungalow

  i have a liking for the hills it
began to rain and grow dark and your
light guided me to shelter

  she bent over to stir the fire and
he saw something slip from the folds
of her waist and hang suspended from
a thin chain she concealed it quickly
her eyes searching his face as she did
so

  going to the table she made an at-
tempt to eat but the food with the
exception of a cup of tea remained
untouched

   its good tea missus he said with
 his eyes on the pot

dathrih

  she poured him another cup stand-
ing beside him as he sipped it

  thank you missus he said hand-
ing her the empty cup it takes the
chill out of my bones

  she put the cups and saucers into
a small pan and carefully washed and
dried them as she replaced them in
the cupboard she touched a platter
which fell to the floor she imme-
diately moved another in its place be-
fore she gathered up the bits

  having disposed of the dishes she
pulled a blanket from a box and laid
it beside him his eyes asked a ques-
tion which she answered

  i would not turn out a dog that
sought shelter to-night you may go
to sleep there by the fire you need
not hesitate i have no designs upon
you

  you are brave to ask a tramp to
stay all night

  i am almost as poor as you if you
see anything you desire you are free
to take it

  seating herself beside the table she
opened a book but he felt that her eyes
were continually upon him

  outside the rain beat furiously upon
the small bungalow while the wind
swept the trees with wild sounds ter-
rifying to the usual woman but she
sat unmoved through it all throwing
wood from time to time upon the fire
then returning to her book

  toward morning he went to sleep
when he awoke the wornn had left
the room and the door of the cup-
board was open hearing no sound
he crossed the floor and pushed aside
the largest platter slipping his fingers
over the rough boards he forced a
small opening and saw a box firmly
secured against a panel

  it was empty except that in one
comer gleamed a wonderful diamond
lodged in a crevice as if caught there
when rudely wrenched from a neck-
lace he put it in his pocket his eyes
the kiss of the silver flask

glittering as he pushed both the board
and platter in place and reseated him-
self before the fire

  the woman returned after a short
time and moving quietly laid aside
a muddy dripping cloak she made
no explanation and he asked no ques-
tions she returned to her book and
thus the remainder of the night passed
and with it the storm

  the man accepted the cup of coffee
which she presently handed him and
gruffly thanked her for her hospitality
he then went down the steep crooked
trail the woman watching him until
he was lost among the hills

  mrs temple was receiving guests
when her nephew george field ar-
rived with a new man

  good evening aunt amelia let
me introduce my friend gillis dyson
i took the liberty of bringing him along
without a formal invitation to either
of us gill went to college with me
and helped your unfortunate nephew
out of a good many scrapes

  mrs temple held out her hand to
the stranger

  i thank you for saving the honor
of the family george is noted for
his blunders at home as well as at col-
lege

  i hope you do not mean that i have
blundered in coming to-night without
the usual note george said wickedly

  do not mind him mr dyson he
likes to spar with his old aunt now
george you are acquainted with all
my guests see that your friend enjoys
himself

  i see aunt crete here and she
looks stunning for a widow not yet
four months old her grief has neither
affected her looks nor her dress
dropped her mourning rather soon
didnt she uncle george would be
flattered to see how soon his loving
wife recovered from her great grief

will you forget me so soon auntie
when i pass on

  ill hold your tricks in memory
-you can always depend on that if it
be any consolation to you

  even a bad deed may erect a mon-
ument to a fellow

  his aunt laughed

  mr dyson do not let him demor-
alize you

  i must pay my respects to aunt
crete i wonder if there might be a
chance for me you see i have the
money she sold herself to obtain and
lost

  george his aunt reproved i
have no fault to find with crete
except that she did not keep her
mourning on long enough but that
black and blue and silver thing is
mighty becoming and covers a multi-
tude of broken conventions

  his aunt had turned to a new guest
and his words were lost

  come on dyson and meet the
charming widow if it wasnt against
my training id take a chance myself
handsome isnt she

  mr dyson was watching her with
a perplexed face he rubbed his hand
across his brow as if trying to recall
something

  aunt crete i am glad to see you
looking well after a sad occasion you
look stunning in that new creation
this is my friend mr dyson will
you kindly take him off my hands while
i go talk to some of the pretty girls
for an instant mr dyson and mrs
field looked into each others eyes
then she said lightly my nephew
is incorrigible mr dyson when you
know him better you will cease to won-
der at anything he does or says

  my experience has been rather full
i went to college with him

  again came the searching look in
her dark eyes

  will you show me the conservatory
mrs field george has told me that
the kiss of the silver flask

mrs temple has a number of rare

orchids

  i shall be pleased to do it are
you fond of flowers mrs temple
has a superb collection of rare plants

  how beautiful he exclaimed as
they entered among the mass of plants
and vines it is like another world

  i am glad you are able to appreciate
such beauty george calls them weeds
i wish george was more like you-
well-balanced-he embarrasses me at
times

 he is a good fellow-true as

steel dyson said in defense of his
friend

  but not master of himself as you
are i quarrel disgracefully with
george but i cannot imagine myself
quarreling with or being bored by yon
you would keep my intellect at its
highest tension and even a reaction
would fail to lessen my interest in you

  you flatter me

  i am merely stating a fact do
you read faces easily i am sure you
do now george doesnt know a vain
woman from a modest one

  they were among the orchids as she
spoke and she gave him the names and
histories of a few rare ones bending
over to bring a small blossom into a
better light a thin chain she was wear-
ing caught in a branch and a tiny sil-
ver flask slipped from the folds of her
waist and rested against his hand

  what a beautiful flask he ex-
claimed in admiration so minute in
design yet so perfect

  it is very old

  is it a perfume bottle may i open
it

  she shook her head and held out
her hand

  it contains a powerful headache po-
tion and so precious that i rarely use
it it was given me in india by a man
who distilled it from a flower little
known

  she was watching his face as she

spoke but he seemed to have lost his
interest in the trinket she slipped it
back among the folds of her waist

  be careful she warned you will
strike that rare one over your head
you are a tall man remember not
too tall however i like tall men

 i am glad you approve of my
height i sometimes depreciate it my-
self

  i see you and the merry widow have
formed a mutual admiration society
george said to his friend when they
were alone in his room let me give
you a piece of advice dont
why

  she isnt the real thing

  i thought her complexion quite nat-
ural

  her skin is o k and she does
not invest in hair goods but she is a
mere butterfly sipping only from the
richest plants she is greatly inter-
ested in you wanted to know where
you came from and how long i had
known you

 and you said-

  that she need not waste her smiles
on you that you were a poor devil of
a lawyer struggling to keep a decent
suit for important occasions

  you were discreet by the way
who was she before her marriage to
your uncle

  i know but little about her and i
judge he knew less he met her at
palm beach among the gay crowrd her
unusual style helped her in the game
and they married two months later
much to her satisfaction but it proved
a losing game for her uncle died in
less than a year and had little money
to leave her it was entailed she
saw it all handed over to me but she
was game never a look or word be-
trayed her

  she looks a cool one

  aunt amelias home is open to her
and uncle left her enough to keep up


the kiss of the silver flask

appearances she will soon find an-
other fool to buy her dresses and dia-
mond rattles

  i find her interesting i intend to
cultivate her

  do not blame me if you get
scorched

  she knows more than you give her
credit for my friend

  wise or otherwise

  does your aunt amelia like her
she flatters aunt amelia and gets
well paid for the service

  for three weeks dyson remained
with george field much of the time
was spent at mrs temples where he
always found a welcome from both
women

  one evening he and george called
and found mrs temple alone the
widow had gone to her room with a
headache much to the relief of his
friend instead of leaving by the front
way they went through the garden to
make a short cut to a certain street
just as george was about to open a
gate in the wall dyson put his hand
on his arm and pointed toward the
house

  they saw a woman in a dark coat
and long automobile veil wound around
her face and head stealing through the
garden she passed swiftly through
the gate and closed it after her

  we will follow her gillis dyson
said

  you do not think-

  no matter what i think let tis
shadow her be careful see and
hear all you can without arousing sus-
picion

  they dodged her up one street and
down another until they finally arrived
at the depot where she was joined by
a man who drew her into the shadow
then left her while he went inside to
buy a ticket dyson motioned george
to follow him

  in a moment the man returned and
slipped a ticket into her hand
nine-thirty he said

  dyson caught the words distinctly
then they separated and the woman
after a few turns went inside to wait
for the train

  george stepped beside his friend
he bought a ticket for new york
city-nine-thirty

  remain here while i phone you
can watch her through the window do
not allow her to slip from you

   he returned in a short time and said
go home george and be dumb it
is very important i phoned to bar-
tin keep ready for a phone call but
answer no questions concerning this
incident if i need you the password
is diamonds 

  you do not mean-

   fll explain later

  they separated dyson shadowed
the woman-followed her into the nine-
thirty train-but lost her just as they
pulled out he was baffled and furi-
ous he went to the conductor and
explained matters however and the
train was flagged at the first station
he then hired an automobile and re-
turned to the depot he had just left
there he learned that an express for
upstate had just left and that the man
who had purchased a ticket for the
nine-thirty half an hour earlier had
bought one for a little way-station in
the mountains

  dyson jumped into his car and put
on all speed possible arriving at the
little wayside depot to find that the
train had been flagged a short time be-
fore he reached it

  with the aid of an electric torch
he made his way up the rough wind-
ing path of the hills after a weary
climb he came to an opening and saw
a little bungalow clinging to the side
of the mountain he went slowly cau-
tiously now in the darkness a light
shone through the window and he saw
the kiss of the silver flask



a woman take a small hatchct from a
wood box then open die door shad-
ing her eyes with her hand as she
peered into the darkness straining her
ears to catch the slightest sound hav-
ing satisfied herself that she was alone
she did not enter but closed the door
and passed around the corner of the
bungalow

  dyson crept around the opposite cor-
ner and concealed himself among the
low-growing firs he saw her stoop
and heard a sound like that of boards
being tom loose then a flash of many
diamonds strung together holding an
electric torch close against a board she
nailed it in place she then examined
her work and being satisfied with the
job dropped the torch into her coat
pocket and went inside the bungalow

  he again returned to the window and
saw a magnificent diamond necklace in
two sections in her hands she dropped
it quickly into a common brown-paper
bag then taking a bag oi cakes from
her coat pocket she dumped them
upon the necklace and twisting the
ends carefully together slipped it into
her pocket blew out the light and
went forth into the night

  dyson waited until she had got some
distance away before he investigated
he pried off the board she had so care-
fully nailed on and found a space
within moving his fingers skillfully
he found that the top opened disclos-
ing a small boxlike compartment he
then went inside the bungalow moved
the largest platter which stood against
the wall of the closet and found that
it opened into it

  satisfied he followed the woman
down the steep path like a winged
thing she flew on before him he
could locate her by means of the torch
which she was using he saw the
flash light of the down train which
pulled out before he could descend

  as he was about to enter his car a
hand was laid upon his shoulder and

hough chief of the detective force
stood there smiling

  its all right dyson i arrested
the man just after he left the depot
and knowing you were on the down
train i boarded the up train so as not
to miss the woman either way bartin is
on the train and another of the force
is waiting at the depot i will return
with you and you can explain all to
me i have shadowed the couple for
a long time but have never been able
to find the goods when mrs temple
lost her diamond necklace i put up a
new game and you have worked it
out fine now lets rush

  when the train pulled in the sus-
pected woman stepped from it and
withdrew into the shadow as she did
so hough brushed against her and
secured the paper bag in her coat
pocket

  i have the bag with the diamonds
he informed dyson as he joined him
now we will ride to mrs temples
and meet the others

  the suspected woman glided through
the darkness until she came to the lit-
tle gate in the wall of mrs temples
garden as she slipped the key into
the lock bartin laid his hand heavily
upon her shoulder

  what are you doing he asked

  i am about to enter a little private
gate of which i have the key

  i arrest you on a serious chargev
he said slipping the handcuffs on he
wrists as he spoke

  you are making a serious mistake
i am mrs field mrs temples sister-
in-law

  we will enter by the front way

bartin said will you lend me a
hand he called to an assistant mrs
field refuses to go in by the front
door

  seeing the uselessness of resisting
she went quietly

  they rang the bell and asked for mrs
temple who came down a little dis-


the kiss of the silver flask

turbed at being called from her bed
in the small hours of the morning

  what is the meaning of this un-
usual visit she asked on seeing the
three detectives mr dyson and her
nephew

  sorry to disturb you mrs temple
but i think we have at last found a
clew to your diamond necklace which
disappeared so mysteriously

  then mrs temples eyes fell upon
her sister-in-laws wrists

  crete she gasped surely you
are not suspected

  the phone rang after i had gone
to my room and i was called up to
visit a dying friend up the state i
used the key to the little private gate
in the wall so as not to disturb you
these gentlemen found me returning
and mistook me for a thief

  t have some convincing evidence
hough replied drawing out a paper
bag which he emptied on the table

  it was his turn to be surprised it
contained only a few broken cakes

  dyson you saw her put the jewels
in this bag

  i am not ready to accept your evi-
dence gentlemen mrs temple said
coldly you seem to have made a
serious blunder

  dyson with his eyes on the sus-
pected woman was thinking rapidly
suddenly he looked down at her shoes
to which the mud still clung they
were fine up-to-date walking shoes
but the heels were unusual-not in-
keeping with the general style

  bartin i should like to examine
mrs fields shoes the heels impress
me as being unusual

  bartin raised her foot and dyson
tapped it with a small instrument
as i thought it is hollow

  he inserted a knife pried a spring
and half of mrs temples necklace
dropped to the floor the other heel
was opened and found to contain the
other half

  crete her sister-in-law gasped

  it means that mrs field is one of
the keenest professional thieves in this
country-she and a man whom we ar-
rested last night

  for the first time the trapped wom-
ans eyes met those of mr dyson
they were like a dagger and ready to
kill him in their intense hatred

  i suspected you that night you
sought shelter in the little bungalow
i was not fool enough to mistake you
for a tramp when i left the room
the first time i warned my brother
the second time i removed the dia-
monds to a more secure place when
you came here with george i recog-
nized you at once knowing that you
would finally track me down do you
remember that i told you on that wild
night when you asked me if i was
afraid that i was prepared 

  with a swift movement of the hand
they had released she drew out a lit-
tle silver flask and held it against her
tongue then it fell the length of its
silver chain and dangled against her
dress

  your prey has escaped you mr
dyson but you won the game i bid
you all good night

  her head dropped against the chair
the powerful poison had done its work

    the author monsieur j joseph-renaud who j fiw sory  a tnyj-
fmtfwj du happens to be the champion fencer of france and of the world-
amateurs and professionals included

am going to tell you of an adven-
ture which happened to me and
which always makes me feel creepy
as soon as i think of it

  my parry and thrust after a parry of
quarte with which in a duel i
wounded the italian fencing master
carlotti you remember ah how the
crowd talked of my calmness the sci-
ence i showed my rapidity of action
the accuracy of my thrust the way in
which i seized my opportunity and so
on i let them talk for no one would
have believed me had i told them that
in reality my merit was very slight

  well the day before this duel-a
most serious one-my own old fencing
master lamotte had been very ill for
several months past what was the
matter no one knew exactly but he
had never properly recovered from an
attack of inflammation of the lungs
which affected his heart and then he
had diabetes on top of it all

  this was my seventeenth duel and
the poor man had not missed one of
the preceding sixteen his enforced ab-

sence this time must have been a grief
to him for he was very fond of me
it was he who gave me my first fenc-
ing lessons at school it is to him that
i owe my rapid parry and thrust i
had never joined any fencing school but
his ah he was not the white-livered
peace-loving sort of fencing master of
to-day who is terrified at the mention
of a duel his favorite pupils were
the quarrelsome bad-tempered ones

  i went to see him in his little house
at bois-colombes i had not seen him
for some weeks and  found him ter-
ribly changed grown thinner than ever
with haggard eyes in a yellow face
and a hollow voice

  evidently it was only a question of
days with him now poor fellow yet
he still got up and went for little walks
in his garden he had read the an-
nouncement of the duel in the papers
the duel i mortiere was to fight with
carlotti and he was deeply distressed
to think that he could not witness it

  i know my boy that you are not
a bad fencer and you are very quick
i

mortiers duel

to parry and thrust but it always

seemed to me as though i brought you
good luck no matter if i did not come
near you if i only looked on from a
distance i felt that my very presence
brought you success

  how are you going to manage to-
morrow against the italian they say
that the wretch is a first-rate swords-
man ah i shall eat my heart out
if to-morrow by any lucky chance i
happened to be a little stronger how
glad i should be to come and see you
fight once more

  when i am dead you will have to
get on without me but it vexes me that
while i am still alive you should stand
up without my being there

  i assured the good old man that
thanks to his excellent lessons i felt
certain of wounding carlotti and i
forbade him to make the smallest effort
to come and see the duel though i knew
all the time that he was much too ill
to do so

  well the next day a little before
noon-noon is always my hour-i ar-
rived quite calmly at the parc des
princes with my witnesses and a doc-
tor

  it was ideal weather for a duel
warm fine and springlike with a few
fleecy clbuds passing over the sun the
trees were covered with new little
shoots daisies whitened the grass
around the bicycle track and crowds
of sparrows rising from every bush
flew in the air like black specks against
the light

  about forty french and italian fenc-
ers were present i undressed in the
dressing room used by the cyclists rid-
ing in the races i was smoking a de-
licious cigarette and when you find a
cigarette good just before a duel you
are certain to wound your adversary
my witnesses won the toss so all was
going in my favor

  carlotti is a shriveled-up little man
of an olive complexion he was per-

fectly calm and this made some im-
pression on me with his sword bound
to his wrist with a strap like all italian
fencers he fell into a horizontal guard
and at the word go he immediately
began to attack

  his blade was always faultlessly in
line and he made quick and persistent
attacks till i felt as i did at my first
lessons when i could not find a spot
to get in a thrust i parried well but
my thrusts never reached their mark
and he immediately gave a counter
parry and thrust at the same time
pressing me back

  i was forced to fall back farther and
farther till at the end of the bout i
was only six feet from my boundary
line

  my witnesses did not think it a joke
i assure you during our short rest i
tried to think out a plan of attack but
my ideas were all mixed

   we were told to fall into guard again
i immediately attacked hoping to press
carlotti back and thus regain some of
my lost ground but not only did he
parry but each time i nearly received
his thrust as for trying to rid my-
self of him by wounding him at the
hand or the arm that was impossible
his hand and arm were faultlessly cov-
ered by the bell of his sword

  he returned to his terrible attacks
i parried better than during the first
bout but i still found it impossible to
get in a thrust i knew there was some-
thing i ought to do but what was it
i wanted to pull myself together and
calculate but my adversary gave me
not a moments respite by the time
the second bout ended i was almost
done

  i could see by the faces of the spec-
tators that they thought it was all up
with me my friends were grave the
italians were exultant

  and what could i do i had en-
tirely lost my composure i did not even
try to calculate
mortiers duel



  the duel began again there was
now not the eighth of an inch for me
to fall back in i should have to parry
every attack without stirring i with-
stood the first few but my thrusts re-
mained without effect and the counter-
thrusts of carlotti came thick and fast

  i was gasping my sword was a dead
weight at the end of ray worn-out arm
my left hand was hanging limp beside
me stars began to dance before my
eyes

  by his repeated feints by the way
in which he seemed to be gathering up
his strength by a peculiar expression
of his mouth by the catlike stillness of
his blade which seemed to be slowly
but surely driving home i saw that
carlotti was going to attack and that
he meant to finish me i felt that all
was over

  just at that moment a neighboring
clock struck twelve with dramatic ef-
fect-the hour of my death

  pictures of my childhood began to
rise before me-the house where i was
born the old market town with its
gables and posterns built high above
the violet-hued valley the wrinkled
faces of my parents bending over me
when i was ill

  yet i made a supreme effort and
tried to get round -carlotti but in
vain for he barred the way both to the
right and the left my attempt how-
ever prevented him from attacking

  at that moment far away behind
my adversary i saw old father la-
motte

  i only caught sight of him for a mo-
ment of course for i was kept busy
defending myself but i saw him quite
distinctly his face was frightfully pale
and he was leaning heavily on his stick
with his right hand he hastily imitated
a quarte parry followed by a disengag-
ing thrust

  it was a revelation to me to be
sure if my thrusts had been without
effect it was because as soon as i had

parried carlotti followed automatically
along the same line and as i gave a
straight thrust all my rapidity was use-
less and not only did i not hit my ad-
versary but i exposed myself to the
counter-thrust at last i understood

  to a very evident feint of my ad-
versary i replied by a quarte parry and
then thrust home in disengaging

  halt

  on the italians shirt in the middle
of his chest a red spot appeared

  perhaps this advice given by panto-
mime was not strictly according to
rule but carlottis seconds were two
fencing masters who gave him useful
advice between the bouts it was tit
for tat

  while i was dressing i asked a friend
to go and fetch lamotte but he was
nowhere to be found

 as you may imagine i told my
coachman to drive round by bois-co-
lombes for i was anxious to thank my
good friend at once

  but the appearance of the little house
as soon as i caught sight of it through
the trees filled me with surprise and
a terrible presentiment

  why were the shutters closed

  i hurried up the path lamottes old
servant her eyes red with weeping
opened the door and began sobbing as
soon as she saw me

  to cut my story short he had not left
the house

  on the stroke of twelve a fatal syn-
cope caused by embolism carried him
off as be was taking a little walk in
his garden and speaking of my duel

  well whom do you suppose i saw

  who was it who gave me the advice
which saved me when i was already
done for defending myself blindly
a being of my imagination  i am very
healthy-minded and besides a being
whom i had invented would not have
been cleverer or cooler-headed than i
and i have never been subject to hal-
lucinations then who was it
she has always controlled me even
when i was so young that i wore
my hair upon my shoulders in
long golden curls-even then was i
under her influence there are some
people i take an instant dislike to and
she was one of these for there was cer-
tainly no other real reason for my de-
testation in the beginning

  no other person in paris did i so
dread and to-day there is no person or
thing in the whole world of which i am
so afraid she has but to express a
wish and i hasten to gratify it should
i hesitatingly suggest a course of action
and should she disapprove i instantly
obey her whim her will is mine

  she is ugly as the bastile and always
has been so i think hers is an ugli-
ness so grotesque that it fascinates me
like the head of a gargoyle on the
towers of notre dame but it was
not her ugliness that terrified and re-
pulsed me at first it was her right eye
-an oblong green organ in which the
pupil is vertical like a snakes

  i say her right eye because she in-
variably wears a black patch where
the other should be later i came to

dream about that other eye-weird
dreams of an eyeless socket black as
the pit from which a flame tongue
forked like a vipers has darted out at
me like a flash of evil she needs but
one eye for the passion in that green
orb leaps out upon one like lightning
from a black sky i have known her to
fix my father-a man of daring and
resolute character-with that eye of
hers and make his will a flexible thing
under her influence

  i really believe the old woman loves
me passionately and has never done
anything deliberately to injure me in-
deed everyone who knows us deems
me insufficiently grateful for her guar-
dianship but i digress to my story

  the first time i saw madame la
gourmande i was about five years old
until then my life had been the dream
of a happy child i lived with my
parents in a private house set back a
little from the rue de roche and not
far from la college chaptal where i
attended the lower school for the little
ones i remember it all as if it hap-
pened twenty hours instead of more
than twenty years ago-
green eye



  there i was then as bright a young-
ster as any in paris and it is easy to
imagine me with my slate pencil box
and a childs book or two strapped to
my shoulders as a soldier carries his
knapsack a little red soldier cap cocked
jauntily upon my curly pate my hands
in the pockets of the black apron all we
schoolboys wore and my red lips
pursed in a merry whistle as i tripped
down the avenue one sunshiny morn-
ing-on my way to school ma bonne
-my nurse that is-did not accom-
pany me because the school was so
near

  madame la gourmande came grunt-
ing around the corner with all the grace
of an elderly hippopotamus we col-
lided and i rolled in the gutter

  oh le pauvre petit

  she said it in a bass voice as she
came lumbering toward me her huge
arms oust retched and her one eye with
its serpents pupil glittering greenly

  oh le pauvre petit f and she had
picked me up and crushed me in to
her saggy bosom which smelled of
musk and mildew she kissed me and
her kiss tasted of onions and eau de
vie and her rough beard scraped my
tender face i struggled violently in
the suffocating softness of her arms
and breast i kicked i screamed
finally she put me down and i danced
away from her furious

  you-you-you i cried unable to
word my rage my bare knees had
been bruised by my fall and as i
rubbed them i grimaced at her i was
not more than five or six years old
you see and as i was the only child i
had been spoiled

  my poor little one she said in
that grating voice of hers my poor
child i am so sad you have scratched
your pretty pink knees come hither
and i shall give you bonbons seel

  she advanced fumbling in the capa-
cious pockets of her black silk gown
she was a huge creature broad as she

was tall this female cyclops and how
old it cannot be said she seemed to
have no particular shape for she
bulged here and she bulged there and
in the most unexpected places too
her feet were surprisingly small and
even daintily shod but her hands could
have throttled a horse

  and her face-it was a nightmare of
the damned all i can do is strive to
give a vague impression of her coun-
tenance her one glittering eye and
the patch of black over the other would
have made her hideous in any case and
in addition she had a pair of mus-
tachios which if she had let them
sprout would have made the fiercest-
looking gendarme in paris thrill with
envy

  her mouth was a weird thing of tre-
mendous elastic possibilities and she
was as snaggle-toothed as a witch and
bearded like a pard perched on her
head was an absolutely ridiculous little
black bonnet tied with black ribbons
under a chin as grim as the prow of a
battleship

  see she coaxed and held out a
double handful of candies i eyed them
greedily for mine was an unusually
sweet tooth but such was my revulsion
to the old woman that i shrank instead
of approaching

  naughty child she rumbled

  i stuck out my tongue at her and
was horrified petrified at what hap-
pened

  out ran her own tongue and it
wagged itself at me its tip fully six
inches from her mouth her one re-
markably expressive eye gleamed with
a green and venomous sense of humor
and i stared and stared as i saw the
comers of her mouth slowly stretch
until her face looked as if some one had
severed the lower part of her coun-
tenance

  with a shriek of terror mingled with
hysterical merriment i fled i did no
work in school that day i drew pic-


green eye

tures on my slate of an indescribable
face split by a terrible grin out of
which rolled a gargantuan tongue hat
wagged and quivered with astonish-
ment at its own size

  and so ended my first meeting with
madame la gourmande the old woman
destined to twist my life all awry

  the next day was thursday a day
hailed by all french schoolboys with
delight for school does not keep that
day the americans and the english
give a whole or a half holiday on sat-
urday and thus their little ones rest
and play saturday and sunday to-
gether but we french liberate our
children from the prison of the school-
room on thursday instead of satur-
day for we believe it breaks the monot-
ony of the week anything to escape
monotony we say

  thus it was i sat that bright spring
morning in the little garden in front
of my home wishing that i had some
other little boy or girl to play with
a messenger lad whose uniform and
cap with the gilt lettering bon marche
declared he came from one of the larg-
est department stores in paris ap-
peared at the garden gate

  he carried a huge thin cardboard
box my curosity was piqued for i
knew from the shape of the box it
could not be another hat or a dress
for my mother and he was such a
merry messenger boy he winked at
me as he asked if monsieur jacques
renan lived here jacques renan
that was my own name my father
was monsieur charles renan

  mats cest moi i cried running
to open the gate for him but he would
not give me the mysterious package
he wanted some older member of the
household to sign for it and so i took
his hand and skipping in my eager-
ness pulled him to the house

  one of the domestics signed his
book and not until then did i get my

package father and mother were out
and so i shared the joy of opening the
strange box with the servants it con-
tained a fine big hoop and a beautiful
stick with which to roll it it was just
what i had longed for not until i
grasped the stick did i notice a little
piece of paper wound tightly about the
handle i slipped it off and found it a
note but as i could barely read at that
age one of the servants told me what it
said

  for jacques from his fairy god-
mother

  the whole affair was assuredly most
exciting but i did not remain long
wondering who was my fairy god-
mother it was enough that i had a
hoop and stick and that the day was
beautiful i paid not the slightest at-
tention to the domestics advice to stay
in the garden-i have already said i
was a spoiled child in two minutes i
had slipped the catch of the garden
gate and was out in the street

  how wonderfully that hoop bounded
and rolled i guided it as if the stick
i held were a magic wand on and
on i rolled the hoop down one street
and up another farther and farther
from home of a sudden the hoop
rolling a few feet in advance of me
wobbled and fell on the sidewalk in
front of a squat dingy house oddly
out of place in that splendid residential
section

  a chill of fear shook me as i halted
abruptly as if compelled by some
necromancers power my head slowly
turned to the residence and i found
myself looking up at the old woman
who was leaning from a window on the
second story of her dwelling she was
smiling at me and i thought her smile
the hungry leer of some ogress

  ah little jacques she rumbled i
see that my hoop and stick have brought
you to your fairy godmother eh

  so it was she who had given me
the toy i might have known it
green eye

  it is not polite jacques to stand
there silently like some mannerless
peasant lad you might say bon jour
madame la gourmande i thank you
very much for your nice present all
well-born little french boys are polite
my little jacques i see that i shall
have to take you in hand and teach you
to be gracious

  anger drove fear and wonder out of
me i hated this old woman with a
hate certainly not born of reason it
was a thing purely of instinct

 you do not answer my little
jacques how do you think i knew
your name and where you lived heinf

  in silence i stared at her

 ah she said it in the most
knowing manner in the world and she
laid one tremendous forefinger along-
side her shapeless nose ahl and
her mouth began to stretch

  i did not wait to see it distend- i
was too afraid that horrifying tongue
would pop out and wag itself at me and
besides her one green eye cleft with
a streak of vertical light made me
tremble

  again i fled straight across the
street i ran wildly not seeing the taxi-
cab spinning around the comer on two
wheels and pure luck driven recklessly
as all cabs are driven in paris espe-
cially in those days when taxis were
comparatively novel vehicles

  there was a bellow from the old
woman in the window an oath from
the driver of the cab a scream from
some passer-by and down i went under
the wheels of the machine

  i regained consciousness in a hos-
pital my legs were broken and both
collar bones smashed and it would be a
long time before i could move i was
told i have walked with a limp ever
since that day for when my limbs
mended one leg was shorter than the
other

  father and mother were at my bed-
side when i came to my senses it

seems madame la gourmande had
taken charge of me the moment the taxi
struck me down she had picked me
up for the second time in my life and
had commandeered the cab driving like
fury to the hospital where she had en-
gaged a private room a nurse and had
done everything to make me comfort-
able

  she insisted on paying all the bills
too and browbeat my father in the
matter for he objected strongly to a
stranger making any outlay for one of
his family the moment that she had
placed me in the hospital madame la
gourmande went to my home and noti-
fied my parents from that moment
commenced her influence with my peo-
ple which was surprising for my
father had been a military man and
his sweeping whiskers ramrod bearing
officers frown and commanding man-
nerisms imposed on most people

  my parents always respected mad-
ame la gourmande and although they
grew to like her as a sincere friend
of the family they were always a little
in awe of her it was her hypnotic eye
i suppose

  all my whisperings to my mother
had no effect

  hush jacques she would say
it is wrong to dislike and distrust
people because they are not beautiful
madame la gourmande loves you like
a son almost at times i your
mother am a little jealous of her love
she is very rich and can give you
wonderful toys and she has no rela-
tives who knows jacques-your
father cannot leave you wealthy as he
would wish and madame la gour-
mande- try to love her a little

mon enfant 

  gradually in addition to my fear and
hatred of this old woman there grew
up in me a violent superstition that
every action of hers touching my life in
the least was bound to result in harm
for me no matter how kindly her in-
i

green eye

tention the result was sure to be the
same indeed every thing that
madame la gourmande did for me bore
out that superstition and the episode
of the hoop the taxicab and the hos-
pital is but one illustration

  i remember cutting my left
hand badly while playing in the garden
of our home i ran inside frightened
at the blood and crying with the pain

  madame la gourmande was in the
room with my mother and instantly
both women were sympathy at once
but my childs mind blamed the family
friend for the accident i felt sure
that if she had not been visiting us i
would never have wounded myself

  out of her huge pockets that seemed
to contain everything one needed
madame la gourmande drew a phial
containing some colored liquid it was
good for cuts and bruises she said and
despite my loud objections my mother
made me hold out my hand while the
old woman poured a few drops of the
fluid on the hurt

  immediately the pain stopped i
stared at her with round frightened
eyes while the tears dried on my face
that to me was but another proof of
her witchcraft or her dealings with the
devil

  that night my injury began liurting
more than ever it throbbed like a
wounded bird one holds in the hands
the pain of it kept me from sleeping
i got out of bed and pushing open the
long glass windows that led to a little
balcony stepped outside

  moonlight bathed everything in a
cool white mystery i looked up at
the moon which looked like the head
of a huge silver nail driven up through
the flooring of heaven her light broke
softly upon my face some of it falling
upon my hand seeming to do it good

  i unwound the bandage and held up
the swollen member to the moon wav-
ing it slowly as if to wash it in her
light the pain abated i walked to

the end of the little balcony where i
might watch the moon without craning
my neck uncomfortably

  i shuddered as i thought madame la
gourmande might be watching the
moon at that very moment and even
as i thought the balcony gave way be-
neath me and i fell headlong to the
pebbled garden walk many feet be-
low

  this time i broke but one leg and did
not pass into troconsdousness my
cries soon brought help and in a few
minutes i was back in my little bed
the center of an anxious group yes
madame la gourmande was there my
mother telephoned her and she had
come instantly late as it was

  she said she had been sitting up
watching the moon

  there and then i resolved to be as
polite to her as i knew how it was
fear-icy fear-you see pr i child-
ishly believed her to be a sorceress of
some sort no one knew how old she
was and to-day she looks just as she
did that fateful morning i bumped into
her on my way to school

  the servants all feared and obeyed
her for with that all-seeing eye upon
them there was little deceit and no petty
thievery about the home over which
she wielded an extraordinary power i
have heard the domestics whispering
that madame la gourmande was
widowed during the franco-prussian
war and so it is really frightening if
one stops to consider her age

  like the night she never changes
always is she gowned in her antique
black silk always is that ridiculous
little bonnet tied upon her head al-
ways does she smell of musk and mil-
dew and always does her eye glitter
like a live green thing while eternally
does she wear that sinister black patch
concealing a sightless socket

  and so as i grew up with the dread
of this old woman hovering like an
evil dream over my life the time came
green eye



for me to decide upon the profession i
would follow my lame leg exempted
me from military service and i had not
the slightest inclination for business

   i wanted to be an artist and as my in-
cessant drawing had demonstrated my
bent and as my parents were quite
well-to-do they were willing that i
should follow my inclination but
madame la gourmande said that ar-
tists led disreputable lives and that
they seldom became substantial citi-
zens she decided the matter

  i want the boy to be a doctor she
said

  but once again after that did i try
to stem her will

  i will not be a doctor i cried i
am going to be an artist

  there was a scene my mother left
the room weeping i stormed with a
rage that surprised myself and my
father walked the floor tugging nerv-
ously at his waxed military mustache

  very well finally said madame la
gourmande let us give this colt his
head let him try to win a scholarship
at lacadcmie des artistes and if he
fails at the end of the year he shall
study medicine

  agreed i shouted i shall win
  she held me with her eye

  you will not succeed said she i
will it that you become a physician
but you shall have your chance for the
scholarship

  she kept her word madame la gour-
mande she arranged everything and
in a few weeks i was happy with char-
coal and pencil at the art school my
work was sufficiently advanced to ad-
mit me to the life class and there i
seemed to make rapid progress

  some whimsical old patron of the
arts had endowed the school making
the odd provision that the examina-
tions for the scholarships should con-
sist of a few hours work in class at the
end of the year the students were
to sketch from a life grouping

  the day for the examination came
i had made fast progress in my work
and the household was excited regard-
ing the possibility of my receiving the
palm mine was a typical parisian
family-father mother child and one
or two close family friends the in-
terests of the circle were turned in upon
itself it knew little other life there
is something intensely provincial and
narrow in the life of such french
families even in paris the liveliest
metropolis in the world

  i set out that morning my face
bright with hope at the gate of our
home i met madame la gourmande

  ah little jacques you think you will
win 

  i am sure of it rna tante 

  you forget i have willed that you
become a doctor it is for your own
good jacques

  i	replaced my cap which i had
doffed and fidgeted in my eagerness to
be off

  suddenly her one eye flashed its
power into me

  you will become a doctor jacques
she said quietly her glaace still froze
me some seconds after she had wad-
dled into my home

  a feeling of the futility of everything
settled like a fog upon my soul i
dragged myself to the classroom and
hardly looked at the models i knew it
was useless to try and draw them of
its own accord it seemed my hand
began outlining a lumpy face with a
startlingly powerful jaw my pencil
filled in a loose shapeless mouth-the
coarse lips rolled back in a grimace that
disclosed stumpy discolored teeth like
snags in some foul crooked stream
the nose was a bulbous thing that
spread itself indescribably and the eye-
brows were shaggy and black running
obliquely across a streak of a forehead
until they met over the bridge of the
nose the right eye glared like a cats
in the dark there was a black patch


green eye

over the other a well-defined mus-
tache crouched upon her upper lip and
upon her chin there were clumps of
coarse whisker a few gray hairs
straggled about her head on which
perched a ridiculous little black bonnet

  i drew another picture i sketched a
bulging massive figure with small al-
most dainty feet riding furiously on a
broomstick above the rooftops of paris
she wore a tall conical hat and her
face was an evil profile black against
a sickly bright moon

  the bell rang the examination was
over i signed my name boldly to my
drawings and left the room

  i had determined to run away

  without returning home i set out it
was my intention to reach marseilles
and then smuggle myself aboard some
ship for america there were a few
francs in my pocket and i was not
afraid although but a schoolboy
hardly well into his teens

  that night with the roar of paris
miles and miles behind me it seemed i
slept by the side of a broad highway
which a peasant had told me was the
road to marseilles it was nearly sum-
mer and the night was delicious

  the sky made a beautiful velvet
counterpane and my couch of mother
earth seemed gentle and kind to my
tired young limbs the cool soft kiss
of the night wind closed my eyelids
i regretted neither my parents nor my
home and i fell asleep smiling up at
the golden fleurs de lis of my coverlet

  the sun had been up hours before
i awoke stiff and sore from my night
in the open i was strangely dizzy too
but there was a buoyancy in my bosom
that was unwonted and i had not
walked far before i was singing a pop-
ular chanson of paris

  ii wa jamais besoin dun parapluit
    quanb le temps il fait beau

  mats quand il tombe de la pluie

	est trompi avec de veau f

  as the sun climbed its rays grew
fiercer and my head began to ache
the dizziness increased i left the road
to wander in a meadow fair with flow-
ers and there i met a farm girl with a
huge yolk across her shoulders sustain-
ing two frothy pails of milk for it was
still early morning

  of her own accord she gave me to
drink and drink i did long and deeply
i left her staring at me as i again took
the road an old peasant twisted and
warped with the years like an ancient
tree passed me with his team of oxen
dragging a creaking wagon filled with
garden truck i was interested in his
withered bearded old face his blue
smock and coarse baggy trousers and
huge sabots filled with straw and i
would have liked to have handled the
long iron-tipped goad with which he
prodded on his oxen i walked by his
side until he turned down a side path
and i watched him until a bend in the
road hid him

  as i walked on an impulse for
greater flight came upon me and i
quickened my pace continually turn-
ing my head to survey the highway
i had traversed i lengthened my
stride then i began to run and i
ran and ran spurred on by nameless
fright until i fell senseless by the road-
side

  there he is the poor dear child

  how that hoarse rumbling voice
penetrated nay unconsciousness some
one forced something hard between my
lips and a fiery liquid scorched my
throat i opened my eyes and found
myself staring into the face of madame
la gourmande

  it seems that when i failed to return
from school my people notified the po-
lice and devoted themselves to search-
ing all paris for me madame la
gourmande with her uncanny divina-
tion took the road to marseilles and
had overtaken me in an automobile she
had hired it was inevitable
green eye



  the doctors later said i was suffer-
ing from brain fever brought on by
overwork and excessive nervousness
but i slowly regaining health in my
little white cot in the rue de roche
knew far bettor

  the years went by swiftly enough
i gave up my dream of becoming an ar-
tist and gradually came to take a care-
less sort of interest in my medical
studies eventually graduating com-
fortably at the bottom of my class be-
fore i was twenty-six  had become
an interne at the paris hospital

  there i met clemence brecourt a
nurse she was a quiet girl with a
calm strong face and clear fearless
blue eyes in her for the first time i
found a human being with the sympa-
thy necessary for me to bare my heart
never did she laugh at my terror of
madame la gourmande she listened
very seriously when i told her my
tale one delicate hand frankly seeking
my own

  we grew to love each other very
tenderjy indeed and i frail limping
willess came more and more to lean
upon her and wonder at her quiet
strength of character she regarded
my fear of the old woman in the light
of an obsession and encouraged me to
plan some bold undertaking which
would rid me forever of the old crone

  alas poor clemence

  when my mother informed me that
madame la gourmande had fallen ill
and insisted on being taken to the paris
hospital where she could be attended by
myself it was as if a chill hand had
closed about my heart then the next
instant my bosom thrilled with a new
and terrible thought

  courage jacques i told myself
one bold stroke and you will be a free
man

  never before had i been so attentive
to madame la gourmande i showered
the old lady with little kindnesses and
she was so elated with joy that i feared

  lftathrill

she would get well it was i who ar-
ranged her transportation and it was

i who selected her private room i
made one mistake clemence requested
permission to nurse the old woman
and i consented stupidly enough

  madame la gourmande was in bed
looking up at me from under her
shaggy brows when for the first time
she saw clemence and myself together
one swift glance from her one green
eye and she had read our secret she
called me to her bedside as my sweet-
heart left the room

  jacques quoth the old beldame
jacques mon enfant all thy life i have
been good to thee now i am old very
old i ask of thee my first favor
jacques forget this pale-faced nurse
of thine she has neither birth nor
social position assuredly she can
bring thee no dot

  now for some time i have had my
eye on the girl who will make thee a
proper wife mon fils i know thy
papa and mama will approve my choice
and i feel certain that thou jacques
will obey the wish of thy old god-
mother i shall say no more for the
present

  i did not answer i stood smiling
down upon her but there was no smile
in my heart

 two days did madame la gour-
mande toss in illness two days and
nights did she torture clemence for
even in sickness the old womans mind
was cold and keen as ever she in-
sisted on the girl waiting upon her in
the most menial capacities never did
she lose an opportunity for an insult
always did she insist on the closest at-
tendance

  the poor dear girl fell under the
spell of the sick woman just as my
father had done-clemence who was
so strong and self-reliant under the
wicked eye of the older woman she be-
came like some frightened little bird
i

green eye

hypnotized by a laey old snake who
held her paralyzed a while before the
swift death blow

  on the third night i asserted myself
for once and demanded that madame
la gourmande release clemence for
rest to my surprise the old woman
gave way to my will and watched me
with a cryptic smile as i placed two
powders on the table by her bed

  one powder contained fifteen-grains
of strychnine the other fifteen grains
of aspirin

  your headache will return to-night
undoubtedly ma tante  said i smiling
like a guileless boy take one of these
powders i hope you will not need
two

  why i left two powders one deadly
the other harmless i cannot say un-
less it was from some desire to let the
old womans own hand unconsciously
dice with life against death

  did i feel any remorse as i sought
my home that night  my breast sang
hke a robin hopping on the grass of the
champs ely see

  clemence who was supposed to rest
that night obeyed some impulse she
could not define and returned to the
hospital taking up her duties at ma-
dame la gourmandes bedside some
power stronger than her own will
drew her to her work she told a sister
nurse

  with her own fair hand she gave
madame la gourmande one of the
powders and watched the old woman
fall quietly asleep

  worn by her vigil my beloveds own
head ached she took the second
powder

  she was found dead on the floor
while madame la gourmande slept the
quiet sleep of one whose illness is
broken

  and i i care not whether i live
or die my always feeble will is hope-
lessly shattered i have given up my
practice of medicine all my days i
spend listlessly at home i understand
that madame la gourmande is arrang-
ing to present me to my fiancee she has
chosen no doubt i shall marry her

out of the night

                        by philip kennedy

      vour voice was like the echo of a song
       that floated to me from that wondrous hour
      out from the night from loves far lonely tower
      beyond the pulse and beat of all the throng

       such dreams as these make singing spirits strong
       and mighty gods grow conscious of their power
       or touch with glory some dejected flower
       beneath the blind steps of a sightless wrong

       love comes in calico or satin gown

            out of the night with dainty tripping feet
       and meets one in the shadows of the town
       amid the tinsel music of the street

      i only know i dared not trample down
        a dream that was at once so strange and sweet
ehemiah morgan until
some five months before his
death was my closest friend
he was a man of rare genius his
books as all know who have read them
dealt with subjects far too abstract and
deep for the lay mind to comprehend
he was a gteat thinker his brain
had that faculty for plowing into the
depths of philosophy and of life and
from the nature of the malady it is
only logical that it should have chosen
him as its first subject

  about five months before his death
we happened to attend together a dem-
onstration given by a certain newi
gomiu of india the evening was full
of interest as the man professed to be
an expert in the tricks of the hindu
magicians nehemiah morgan ap-
peared to be in good spirits and studied
the man with that impersonal scholarly
gaze of his which he always assumed
at any such affair

  at the conclusion of the performance
we went forward to meet the magician

and nehemiah morgan questioned him
in regard to his belief in foretelling
the future he offered a demonstra-
tion and my friend submitted newi
gomiu seated himself at a table took
a pencil in his hand went into a trance
and proceeded to write when he had
finished nehemiah morgan picked up
the paper read it and handed it to
me without any comment it read

  you are afflicted with a terrible disease
it is the first case of its kind on this planet
you will die on january th of next year
the cause will be unknown

  then it trailed off into unintelligible
characters

  that was the last time i saw my
friend it chanced the next day i was
called out of town to attend to some
business in chicago before leaving
i rang him up on the telephone to say
good-by and after we had exchanged
a few commonplace remarks he com-
plained of hearing a buzzing in his
ears thinking it due to the telephone
i paid no more attention to it but


the fear

when i returned two weeks later and
rang up his home his housekeeper in-
formed me that he was ill and had
taken a run up to the adirondacks for
a change

  at that time i did not connect the
buzzing in any way with his illness in
fact the remark had entirely gone from
ply mind and was completely forgot-
ten until as i was getting up from
breakfast a few days later the tele-
phone rang and my friends voice
sounded over the wire he had just
returned from the mountains and in-
stead of regaining his health as he had
hoped he complained of nervous indi-
gestion and the ever-increasing buzz-
ing sensation in his ears we talked
for some minutes and at the end of
the conversation he mentioned for the
first time the fear he did not ex-
plain what it was but made me prom-
ise i would not attempt to see him
and that i would have all letters and
documents he sent me fumigated be-
fore i touched them

  that was the last i heard of him
three days later i passed his brown-
stone residence on my way home from
the office it had the appearance of
being uninhabited the shades were
drawn and on the porch were a num-
ber of sun-browned newspapers won-
dering i lifted the great brass knocker
on the massive door and releasing it
it gave forth a heavy hollow sound
no one answered and after repeating
the performance several times without
result i left in dazed bewilderment to
return home after several fruitless
attempts to reach him by phone i
came to the conclusion that he had
left the city and closed his home in-
definitely

  it was just four months and eight
days later that i received word of his
death on january twenty-seventh to-
gether with the following document ex-
plaining the nature of the strange mal-
ady and describing the tortures he suf-

fered while afflicted with the fear
the letter bore the postmark of a back-
woods town in maine further than
that i have been unable to trace it

  in giving this statement written in
his own handwriting i have had it
carefully copied and forwarded to the
printers in exactly the form i received
it except that in one or two instances
i have condensed long descriptions of
the repeated attacks of the fear how-
ever if thereare any medical men who
want to go into the case more thor-
oughly i will be glad to let them ex-
amine the original manuscripts in my
office the document is as follows

  november   my dear friend
norman humphrys you perhaps
have wondered are wondering even
now at my leaving town without bid-
ding you good-by but at the time of
my departure i was not myself in
fact since this strange disease has
come upon me it is only in occasional
flashes that my old self returns to its
body and i can think of my friends
and of my relations to society without
being oppressed by that awful fore-
boding

  to-night i am myself and while it
lasts i am taking advantage of this
state to prepare for you this document
telling of the symptoms and effects of
this singular malady the document
you will receive after my death and
i direct that you use it in whatever
way seems best to help prevent the
spread of this unknown disease which
attacks only the best and leaves the
ignorant untouched

  you will remember our visiting the
demonstration of the hindu magician
known as newi gomiu on the eve-
ning of the twenty-fourth of last aug-
ust and you will probably remember
his curious forecast of my future

  up to that time i had felt no symp-
toms of the strange malady save an
occasional buzzing in my ears which
i laid to a slight bilious attack that
the fear



night after returning home as i was
sitting in my study reading-you know
it was always my custom to read for
an hour before going to bed-i felt
a repetition of the buzzing coupled with
a peculiar nausea for a moment i
seemed to rouse as from a dream and
my senses became keenly alert then
it passed and i felt all right again
however before going to bed i took
a dose of podophyllum and a hot bath

  in the morning i felt much better
with only an occasional spell of the
buzzing in my ears yet when you
telephoned just before leaving for chi-
cago i was surprised to find that the
buzzing sensation almost doubled in
intensity when i listened through the
receiver you will remember that i
remarked about it at the time that
afternoon i went for a drive along by
the river and in the evening i was
able to do some work on my paper on
the pluralistic universe

  for the next few days i felt no rep-
etition of the attack and the affair en-
tirely left my mind i continued with
my work as usual and enjoyed the best
of health

  about a week afterward however
i was afflicted with a terrible night-
mare visions of horrible forms and
the impression of vainly trying to
escape from their vivid clutches cross-
ing fathomless abysses on slender sup-
ports scaling perpendicular cliffs-
only to slip down down with that sick-
ening falling sensation-all these i ex-
perienced with rapid succession when
i awoke in a state of nervous perspira-
tion there was a severe pain in the
top of my head and i ielt the return
of that buzzing sensation in my ears
in the morning the pain had left and
was replaced with a nausea but the
buzzing sensation still remained

  then came the fear

  i had just arisen from the breakfast
table and was seated in the library bay-
window overlooking the park on this

first attack it came slowly i felt a
certain numbness creep into my limbs
gradually rising from my feet like each
succeeding wave of an incoming tide
at first i thought it was the beginning
of a malaria chill but i did not feel
that chattering coldness which comes
with malaria instead it was more the
sensation one experiences when ones
foot has gone to sleep it climbed
higher and higher up to my knees my
waist and slowly i could feel the numb-
ness creeping into my heart

  strange to say i did not ring for
a servant neither did i move nor shift
my position in any way i had per-
fect use of my limbs although to move
them was a wearisome exertion the
only part of me that seemed paralyzed
was my brain i could think clearly
yet i could not bring myself to act
upon the thought i was almost like
a brain without a body to move my
muscles required the most powerful ex-
ertion on the part of my intellect

  i was that way for some minutes
then with a rush a super-conscious-
ness came over me my hearing was
so acute that the buzzing of a fly on
the windowpane roared in my ears like
the thundering of an express train and
jarred my whole nervous system i
had never realized the amount of noise
around me before the traffic in the
street below the roaring and thunder-
ing of the city the servants moving in
the rear of the house were all magni-
fied a hundred times until the world
seemed to be made up of only a va-
riety of noises then the consciousness
seized my eyesight colors became
more evident until everything i looked
at was a riot of intense reds or greens
or blues the yellow colors strangely
enough were of their normal intensity

  i closed my eyes and as i did so i
could distinctly feel the movements of
the lids as they descended over my
eyeballs it was uncanny i opened
them again


the fear

  as i sat there in the library bay win-
dow under the spell of that strange
superconsciousness feeling seeing
hearing the new-old familiar universe
about me-my sense of taste and smell
did not become intensified during this
first part of the attack-i felt a cer-
tain masterful exultation

  for the moment i was lifted above
the life of mortals but it was only
for a moment and during the subse-
quent attacks i never felt it again

  sitting there with my eyes opened i
experienced the sensation of beautiful
colors glittering jewels soft plays of
light and shadow purples lavenders
magnificent temples the hard flash of
diamonds the warm yellow of gold
now i was in the center of an exqui-
site garden then as by magic i was
transported into the very paths of the
sunset i walked in rome in egypt
in assyria i climbed marble stairways
up to quaint japanese temples made
out of some effervescent substance i
trod the inlaid floors of great arched
chambers and then dropped to the bot-
tom of the sea and wandered among
delicate marine gardens

  during the time of this hallucina-
tion i was keenly aware of everything
going on around me a servant en-
tered and removed some old newspa-
pers littering my study table i
watched the people passing on the
street below and the automobiles as they
spun along the gravel drive in the park
opposite yet i could see somewhere
in the back of my consciousness those
beautiful visions it was a delight
which in my moments of normality i
like to reflect upon by my descrip-
tion you will not feel what they were
like the scenes were too glorious for
me to give you any adequate idea of
how they impressed me

  my brain was still luxuriating upon
the last of these visions-a gorgeous
scene of tropical splendor with snow-
capped mountains in the distance and

a riot of colored foliage and beautiful
birds in the foreground-when with
the swiftness of a descending curtain
the scene was blotted out

  for a moment my senses swirled
then i was plunged into my first ex-
perience of the awful fear the
superconsciousness which i had felt
before was as a grain of sand to a
mountain in comparison with that
which surged upon me in that first mo-
ment my senses which had become
so keenly awakened before broke all
bounds my eardrums throbbed and
vibrated from the roar around me un-
til i could feel their very tissues
tighten under the strain i was aware
of a thousand different noises-shrill
sharp dull heavy the crunching of
gravel under the auto wheels the gur-
gling surging intake of my own breath
each one seemed louder than the other
the vision before me was of outrageous
colors bright repulsive to the eye in-
termingled together in a juxtaposition
of blinding glaring rays of light as
before the yellow kept its normal in-
tensity but the reds and blues were
so strong that to look at them nause-
ated me

  then it was that i became aware of
the sense of taste and smell

  i could taste the saliva in my mouth
and it sickened me to my nostrils
came a variety of odors and scents
which i had never before believed to
exist the smell of the carpet on the
floor was distinctly heavy and odious
the painty smell of the furniture the
strong pungent odor of the leather
chair in which i sat even the smell
of hard substances such as iron and
glass-all these penetrated to the deli-
cate nerve centers in my brain and set
my senses in a whirl of vulgar impres-
sions

  the old world in which i had lived
in partial consciousness became a mass
of hurtling confusion noises colors
odors tastes impressions whirled to-
the fear

gether in conglomeration my brain
was overwhelmed i could feel my
own heart beat could sense the ex-
panding and contracting of my lungs
for a time it fascinated me and i put
my hands over my ears and closed my
eyes so as to be better able to expe-
rience the sensation it was like watch-
ing the slow rhythmical motion of a
giant bellows amid the roar and din
of a huge blacksmith shop the thump
thump of my heart reminded me of
the pound of a pile driver it was like
some uncanny machine

 then the thought flashed through
my mind what if the machine should
stop

 with a new terror i strained my
senses to catch the single beats of my
heart as it pumped the blood through
my veins a large motor truck went
by on the street below and the terri-
ble roar of it completely drowned out
the noise of the thump of my heart
then it was that i felt the fear

  it seemed an hour before the truck
passed and i could again catch the
rhythmical beats i knew that if they
stopped i would be dead and at the
thought of death my imagination
which like the rest of my impressions
was in an abnormal state of acuteness
pictured before my mind black hor-
rible forms which surged about me
like an enveloping swarm of gnats
i opened my eyes only to have my
senses shattered with the blinding rays
of light and the glaring repulsive col-
ors the fear of death returned and
i closed them again and listened with
cold intensity for the rhythmical beats
which denoted my existence

  what if they should stop the idea
crept through nfy brain like a fearful
canker i could feel a cold numbness
stealing through my bones and my
senses swirled into blackness

  i fainted

 when i came to from my faint i
was in my own room jenkins stood

by my bed and doctor horace was
giving me a hypodermic my sensa-
tions at first were as if a current of
warm air had struck my body strik-
ing my head first and gradually en-
veloping me in its warmness until it
reached my feet then the buzzing
sensation returned to my ears but th
a few moments left and i was myself
again-all except for the fear

  from that timejon i have never been
entirely free from that awful grip-
ing fear which overwhelms me dur-
ing the attacks of the strange malady
even as i write this it takes all the
power of my will to force from my
brain that terrible consciousness of the
action of my lungs and of the beating
of my heart in my normal mind i
do not fear death yet when the strange
malady grips me the imminence of
death appears to me like a huge dragon
and chills me to the very bones i have
found that this fear of death is one
of the more acute signs of the disease

  this first attack was on thursday
and on saturday night i left for the
adirondacks taking with me jenkins
and one of the male servants doctor
horace had diagnosed my case as nerv-
ous indigestion coupled with a bilious
attack and brought on by overwork
and advised the trip up into the moun-
tains for a few days poor old doctor
little did he realize the danger of the
strange malady

  that trip to the mountains somewhat
revived me the sharp mornings of
the oncoming autumn the stinging
bracing air the outdoor life all brought
me back to somewhat near my normal
physical health during my stay i
suffered only once from a violent at-
tack of the curious disease and this
spell lasted only a few minutes and
was mild in comparison with those i
experienced later however there al-
ways remained over me that imminent
apprehension of death often i would
find myself unconsciously drop into a


the fear

listening attitude counting the expan-
sions and contractions of my lungs
sometimes i would awaken in the night
with a start cold perspiration on my
forehead terror in my brain and put
in a half hour battling with my will to
drive from my mind the terrible ap-
prehension

  after a week and a half i returned
to the city the only physical symp-
tom of the malady that remained was
an occasional buzzing in my ears
true my digestion was not in the
best working order but i suffered com-
paratively little from it when i called
you up on the phone i was in fairly
good physical health but always seeth-
ing in my brain was that terrible fear
that i would stop breathing or that
the thumping of my heart would cease
it became a mania with me

  i consulted physicians nerve special-
ists metaphysicians new-thought heal-
ers psychotherapists and biochem-
ists but none could give me any re-
lief in fact i even had an examina-
tion by an insanity expert when he
had given me various tests he shook
his head and pronounced me above nor-
mal the thought of the helplessness
of the situation appalled me

  the first indication i bad of the con-
tagious qualities of the disease was
shortly before i returned from the
mountains i received a letter from
doctor horace it was written in a
despondent mood and he complained of
feeling tired and partially losing his
sense of hearing he also mentioned
the buzzing in his ears and the slight
nausea he inquired after my health
and prescribed a change in my diet
the next time i heard from him was
exactly three hours after i had been
talking with you on the phone he
had shot himself in his office leaving
a note stating that he felt his mind
gradually slipping away

  the shock of it brought on one of
those strange spells jenkins told me

afterward that i lay as in a stupor
for two days answered all questions
carried on a conversation and appar-
ently seemed to retain all my normal
faculties of thought yet during that
time i can remember nothing save the
inky fear and a swirling memory of
colors tastes odors sounds and sen-
sations mixed together in confusion
and dominated by a periodic beat-
beat-beat unseen forces seemed to
be struggling against my will to cause
the cessation of that beat and it was
only with the most tremendous rally-
ing of my thought powers that i could
will my heart to continue the inter-
vals between my heartbeats were life-
times in which i experienced all the
terror and unnamed horror of a grip-
ping nightmare no wonder that when
i awakened i was in a dazed condition
weak and exhausted

  i determined then and there to leave
the city and to go into seclusion jen-
kins volunteered to go with me and we
left the next morning on the portland
express for the backwoods of maine

  we have a little cabin here on the
side of the mountain and sufficient pro-
visions to last until spring i have my
library and the reference books to con-
tinue my work on the pluralistic
universe and hope to finish the pa-
per in the intervals between the severe
attacks of the strange malady always
hangs over me the fear-horrible
gruesome chilling even now i feel
it and dare not write more to-night
for already the buzzing io my ears
roars like the surf my feet grow
numb i can feel the coldness creep-
ing to my waist my senses are be-
coming more acute i must stop

  december   it is morning
the cabin is banked with snow and we
are isolated from all the world for
the first time in many days i am able
to think clearly and concisely it is
for that reason i write now jenkins
has caught the malady but as yet he
the fear

i

has suffered only two short spells of
the superconsciousness

  during these i had an opportunity to
watch him the only change in his
physical appearance when he is under
the spell is a slight heightened color
just above the eyes the rest of his
face is pale curiously enough none
of the other servants who were with
me caught the malady from experi-
ments and observations i have con-
cluded it affects only those with a well-
developed brain and especially those
whose memory can carry over a wealth
of small details- it must be caused
by some kind of a micro-organism
which reacts upon the thought centers
themselves

  december   i had a repeti-
tion of the terrible dream last night
the falling sensation this time was
more distinct and vivid than before
when i awakened i was at a loss to
recognize my surroundings the fear
still hangs over me it grips my vitals

  december   it is midnight
and i feel approaching another of those
terrible spells i cannot sleep the
buzzing in my ears racks my whole
system the crackling of the fire jars
my eardrums and its brightness hurts
my eyes as i write i feel conscious
of no other portion of my body save
my hand and forearm the scratching
of the pencil is becoming unbearable

  january   jenkins is worse
last night he experienced the beauti-
ful color sensations which i mentioned
at some length in a previous descrip-
tion these were followed by the fear
in all its terrible super consciousness
he is still in bed weak and exhausted

  myself-the fear has so racked my
soul that i continually count the in-

takes of my breath imagine having to
exert every tissue of your brain will-
ing yourself to breathe to walk to
speak and to perform all the ordinary
functions of life even when i swal-
low a morsel of food i am aware of
its every movement from the time it
leaves my mouth until it reaches the
pit of my stomach and at times the
fear that i will forget to breathe so
grips me that i am shaken with terror
until i faint

  january   i am getting
weaker my spells of normality be-
come fewer and fewer and farther and
farther apart for ten days i have
suffered that icy fear-cold gripping
terrible last night i had a repetition
of the horrible dream with the falling
sensation continually i count the rise
and fall of my chest my work will
remain unfinished i am doomed

  january   it is evening the
sunlight has been so strong to-day that
i have been forced to cover the win-
dows with blankets even then the
light has so racked my eyeballs i could
keep my eyes open only for a few
moments i fear the darkness and its
horrible mystery a sickening riot of
colors plays before my eyes and the
saliva in my mouth tastes bitter and
acid

  january   i am blind i
cannot see the darkness falls about
me like a velvet curtain and i feel it
creeping into my very soul

  the noise of the world is terrible
the fear clutches my heart my
breath comes and goes with conscious
pangs i feel the numbness creeping
into my limbs i cannot survive an-
other spell i fear i will forget to
breathe- good-by
do you want to earn ten dollars
by writing a letter

thrilling experiences

a new department

     we will award ten dollars with each issue to the reader writing
us the best letter about some thrilling experience read the following
announcement carefully before writing your letter

we read in the papers every day
about thrilling experiences
which people have had but we
seldom have an opportunity to obtain
any side lights on the personal sides
there is no use in our repeating the
old phrase truth is stranger than
fiction we all know that it is but
wouldnt it be an interesting thing if
we could read the actual intimate ac-
counts of those who have undergone
some unusual experience that might
have been harrowing occult mysteri-
ous or unexplained  there are stories
told of men and women whose hair
turned white as byron wrote in a
single night do you know any one
who has had such a thing happen to
him such events become far more
enthralling when we can hear the actual
account told by the one involved

  the world is so large a place so
much a matter of sharp contrasts and
unknown things that it is certainly pos-
sible for almost anything to happen
rather than get these things second-
hand we are going to establish a de-
partment in the thrill book where
you or any other reader of the maga-
zien can unburden to the public any
startling experience which has occurred
to you personally or to one of your

friends we are forced through space
conditions to limit these accounts to
five hundred words but we are going
to throw open our pages to all who
can give us something extraordinary

  sit down now and think over your
life it certainly hasnt been as hum-
drum as your neighbors claim it is
there has at some time in your exist-
ence been some experience the un-
usual quality of which has perplexed
you continually for example did you
ever spend a night in a deserted house
we did once and believe us it has been
a burning memory ever since were
you ever in a hotel when it caught afire
did you ever witness some famous or
terrible crime have you ever been
ina terrific storm aboard a ship did
you ever take a trip through some trop-
ical country where few white men had
ever been before did you ever par-
ticipate in some free-for-all fight
have you passed through any occult
or mysterious experience that defied
every known explanation did you
ever see strange faces at night looking
through a windowpane have you
felt clammy hands touch your face as
you walked along some gloomy road
did you ever go through some nerve-
racking hour that aged you ten years
thrilling experiences

or so did you ever have some event
in your life that convinced you that
there was something in the belief that
men do not pass out of the world when
they die have you ever received any
direct word from dead relatives or
friends did you ever know any mo-
ment when something or other hap-
pened that convinced you instantly
what a small atom in the universe the
human soul is

  these and thousands of other ques-
tions have been interesting us ever since
we inaugurated such an unusual ven-
ture as the thrill book-the first
magazine in america to print stories
of occultism mystery and adventure
where the reader has an opportunity to
share in the great ideas that have per-
plexed mankind since the days of adam
and eve it has seemed preposterous
to us that no one has taken seriously
the gripping subjects of occultism and
mysticism which to-day are filling the
minds of men like sir arthur conan-
doyle and sir oliver lodge never-
theless it remained for the thrill
book to tackle a field without any
rivals

  for the first time a large periodical
has come out candidly and admitted
that the american public has a mind
all its own it recognized the new ten-
dencies toward the study of things un-
seen and unheard it realized that peo-
ple are everywhere to-day wondering
about the thousands of men who gave
up their lives in the great war are
they lost forever they are asking them-
selves 

  it will help materially in the under-
standing of these matters if the
thrill book opens its pages to an in-
telligent discussion of thrilling experi-
ences which have come to our readers
thus opening the way to a clearer un-
derstanding of the tragic forces that
control life and death we want them
to be truthful straightforward and in-
telligently done we will either print

them over the writers name or with-
out any hint of the author

  it is all part of the broad policy of
the thrill book-to stand behind
the attitude of those who venerate ed-
gar allan poe ambrose bierce and
many others who have seen clearly that
all does not lie on the surface and that
there are things which transcend mere
logical explanation

  the human spirit is an eternity in
itself life is so stupendous as to defy
the rules of small minds or the under-
standing of the ignorant we are here
to print the sort of fiction that realizes
this in its plots we are the friend of
those who want to be a little broader
than the circle in which they live

  as a reader and believer in the ideals
of what the thrill book has stood
for in the past year and what it plans
to do we ask you to write to us and tell
us of those things that you do not un-
derstand or of adventures in your lives
of which there is no explanation or
which is of so startling a nature as to-
produce a real thrill

  from the letters printed in each issue
we will select the best-written account
of some thrilling experience and award
the writer a prize of ten dollars it
is not necessary to use the typewriter
make your communication brief pre-
ferably not over three hundred and
fifty words the experience must be
a truthful one and have happened to
you or to some one whom you can
trust to give an honest account state
in your letter whether you want it
printed over your own signature or
anonymously we will not consider
any unsigned letters but will gladly
follow your instructions as to the use
of your name in print the check for
ten dollars will go to the prize winner
promptly after the publication of the
number containing the letter the
name of the lucky writer will be given
in each case in the succeeding issue

dreams

the japanese believe it is danger-
ous to awaken a sleeper in case
the soul should be absent we
have often heard dreams discussed but
we must admit that so far we have not
been convinced about the truth concern-
ing their importance in our lives

  nobody yet knows exactly what does
happen when we are asleep doctors
talk about blood pressure but cannot
tell why a lessened pressure should
cause sleep or what happens to our
consciousness during that mysterious
period-nearly one-third of our lives

  some people have been known to in-
telligently answer questions in their
sleep but some authorities assert that
sleep talkers and sleep walkers do not
recollect what they have done after they
are awake- the great burbach states
that children under seven do not re-
collect their dreams though every one
children and animals included all

dream among grown-up people quite
one-third cannot recall their dreams

  there are dreams and dreams not
all are reliable as omens indeed the
only real difficulty is to decide whether
your dream is a bona-fide message or
is due to some ordinary physical cause
and quite without meaning

  no early dream is reliable t ef no
dream that occurs soon after we go to
bed as the bodily processes such as
digestion repair of tissue et cetera are
still in process an uncomfortable po-
sition in bed will cause a valueless
dream a crease in the bedclothes or
in our night attire a ray of light on
the face and many other similar inci-
dents

  we must also remember that a mere
jumble of odd adventure has no mean-
ing and also that some people are never
reliable something in their tempera-
ment preventing a true dream from
manifesting itself it is well known
cross-trails



that watches vary according to the per-
son who wears them a watch appears
often to be quite useless to its owner
but will keep perfect time when worn
by some other person it is the same
with dreams those with whom watches
are thus erratic are quite useless for
true omens

  dreams that come to us near day-
break are the most valuable as omens
and it is generally held that if the
sleeper is lying on the right side the
dream will relate to the past but if
on the left side then the omen refers
to the present and future

  for our part we have read much
about dreams in general listened to
many personal accounts of curious ex-
periences in this line which other peo-
ple have had and also had strange
dreams that perplexed and remained
unexplained

  for instance we have heard it said
that it is most unfortunate to yawn in
a dream you will search in vain for
health and success to jump or break
your way through a wall indicates some
ultimate success to walk on the top
of a wail in a dream is also a fortunate
omen

  there are hundreds of things of this
nature purely and simply omens that
occur in our dreams the question is
do these omens mean anything in a
practical way

  we have all read of great generals
who dreamed of victory or failure on
the night before a battle and awakened
to find it all too true

  there can hardly be any doubt that
the future is often revealed by dreams
there have of course been many ex-
travagant fictions palmed off as facts
relative to dreams but yet enough cred-
ible evidence exists of their importance
to make any singular dream the subject
of reflection and examination

  the subject is a vast one many opin-
ions to the contrary but we feel sure

that many readers of the thrill
book will be able to throw light on
the subject we will publish any let-
ters not over five hundred words in
length and which are serious attempts
to bare the hidden meanings of dreams
such communications will be read with
interest by all who are seeking the truth
about occult and not easily explained
things of life

     the true devotion
dehind everything of value there
must be a reason cause for exist-
ence purpose otherwise only failures
will result this is an age of intensive-
ness sincere effort close competition
success requires conscientious applica-
tion knowledge of what others are do-
ing and how they do it

  corporations exist because of certain
individuals and combinations of indi-
viduals who have worked to a common
end with amazing devotion

  to succeed greatly demands a great
devotion

  in addition to our first element in this
essay regarding work as a pleasure-in
fact demanding it to be so-we move
a step higher we are going to add de-
votion

  if we looked upon our work purely
and simply as pleasure we might suffer
thereby as i have already pointed out
pleasure carries no responsibility but
serious effort does

  just because a man has an ax in his
hand it doesnt mean that he must com-
mit murder he might just as well cut
wood and so with our opinion that
work must be looked upon as a joyful
undertaking

  i leave the rest to you

  devotion is an emotion shared by
beast and man alike it is therefore one
of the fundamental things devotion
wrongly considered is often the means
to a mans failure in life

  the clerk for example may have
doglike devotion to a minor position
i

cross-trails

but i certainly dont respect him for
it if he intends sticking there

  the coldest sight imaginable is that
of the shiny-sleeved clerk devoted to
petty tasks whenever i enter a busi-
ness office and look upon these fellows
i feel sick at heart devotion to a false
ideal is unworthy of any man to be
a narrow-chested idolater of  sham
ideals is a blow at mankind

  the clerk who idolizes his employer
even though he is a crook surely de-
serves to be classed in the same cate-
gory on the same plane is the clerk
who knows nothing of the bright side
of the business and merely is devoted
to his job because he is afraid to lose it

  however devotion to ones own
ideals is another matter once we un-
dertake a line of work and are sure it
fits our capabilities then our devotion
to it counts greatly in the result and
facts

  devotion to my mind is the whole-
hearted sincere up predation of a truth
and the ability to follow it through any
situation or chain of events

  when a man has decided upon the
kind of work he intends following he
must exert himself to the limit to at-
tain his ends it entails sacrifices
struggles and the going without many
superficial things that fill up the lone-
some hours

  to the man or woman alone in the
great city or the farmer compelled to
remain in the sparsely located section
of the country it is frequently hard to
stick to a thing and carry it through to
a fighting finish

  many employees in the city are com-
pelled to live in rooming houses where
the evenings are dreary and long and
sunday arrives with no hope of relief
from the monotony as we said a few
lines back this is an age of intensive-
ness could we ask for a more pitiful
example than this of the reason why
so many fail to succeed

  think of the evenings going to waste

year after year while youth speeds by
leaving them facing old age and no in-
dependent income they do not know
the meaning of intensity their lives
are thin vacuous idle

  imagine that one of those people was
given an opportunity to do the work he
loved what a change there would be
alas the average man dies without
knowing half the possibilities that lurk
in the human mind and will power

  devotion of a sort exists for any
work that we perform because personal
pride enters in and provides all energy
that compels us to move forward even
the clerk wrongly placed knows devo-
tion to his task odious though it may
seem his fellowman is with him in
the office he tries simply because he
would hate to fail after a time he is
deluded into falling into a rut by this
same splendid emotion gone astray

  dont spend your devotion hpon work
that does not fit you drop it my
friend and put your affection on the
right track dont waste any respect
on things of a lower caliber than your
own idea of yourself

  dont be afraid of looking upon your-
self with a favorable eye this doesnt
mean to go to a silly extreme it means
a common-sense appraisal of yourself
as a marketable proposition

  if you were a storekeeper and con-
tinually apologized for the quality of
your goods do you imagine you would
have many purchasers it requires
some publicity to put anything across
properly if you sit back in your chair
chewing your thumb some one else is
going to get away with the cake

  devotion to youq ideals and the can-
did fearless carrying of them into ef-
fect is therefore a prima-facie fact
you might have many ideas but if you
let them lie around idle they would
serve no good purpose

  i	once knew a clever man who had
the worlds knowledge seemingly at his
finger tips he could quote from the
cross-trails

i

greatest writers glibly he was a hard
worker a good family man an extraor-
dinary personality but at the age of
forty he was only getting a salary of
sixteen hundred dollars a year his
brain was like a lumber yard piled high
with uncut wood he had never built
anything with his knowledge he was
the sport of chance the plaything of
fate

  devotion to your ideals in conse-
quence is a working proposition it
means doing something for the things
that you love it means getting some-
where

  the cow is devotion personified but
it produces milk for others to drink
butter for others to eat and calves for
the butchers what does it get for its
devotion

  capitalize some part of your devo-
tion in the cause of self look out for
pure selfishness the open-handed
man generates electricity friends op-
portunities

  the giver is the one who gets to
him who goes through life open-
handed life responds with open hands

  devotion going a step farther means
devotion to something worth while in
the eyes of your fellow men it is the
conscious paying of our debts to indi-
vidual effort

  we cannot get away from another
salient fact at this juncture devotion
is the right state of mind to produce
results it is the generous expression
of self in working terms with two
things in our minds work considered
as joy and devotion to that pleasurable
conception of toil we are well on the
road to the third element health

american fiction

if we were to belive the average mag-
azine we would grow to think that
the world consists mainly of superficial
people who come and go across an un-
real earth the writer of fiction seems

to think that all the mysterious ele-
ments have been explained away so
thoroughly that there is no use in tack
ling them

  this attitude is not only a silly one
but it is leading us into bypaths o
thought and feeling which are curi-
ously enough neither true nor interest-
ing if we believe that the world ia
a simple easily understood thing and
prefer to remain ignorant all well and
good the fact is that the most of u
do not relish the idea of living in the
dark

  when you get right down to facts
even he who runs as well as he who
is too lazy to use his mind comes finally
to the realization that the universe is
big enough to keep us wondering all
our days what lies on the surface is
only a minor element in the big scale
before birth and after death-what of
these questions

  this is proven in the fiction field by
the enormous popularity of such men
as poe bierce and other writers of
occult and strange stories perhaps the
man who is most widely read in amer-
ica to-day-that is among the immor-
tals-is edgar allan poe why
surely not because he was a master of
english there have been plenty of
masters of english who couldnt have
held our interest for as much as ten
minutes in succession it is because
he had the courage to deal with the
unseen the unknown

  to all those who read the narra-
tive of a gordon pym this fact stands
out with refreshing singularity the
hero of that thrilling tale went so far
into the mysteries of another world that
even the mastery of poe could not ex-
tricate him from his adventure so he
left him there he refused to bow to
any so-called popular taste and clear
up the business by a false ending

  we meet this time and again in his
short tales the fall of the house
of usher the pit and the pendulum
io

cross-trails

william wilson ligeia and so on
down the list

  we have been interested therefore
in the fact that no other magazine be-
sides the thrill book has seriously
considered this attitude of mind on the
part of the public the many stories
which we have already published by
unknown writers has convinced us that
there are hundreds more whose work
has been continually jettisoned by the
periodicals we want to see this work

  for example in this number you will
find a tale by lillian beynon thomas
called when wires are down we
can say honestly that for suspense and
mystery it is without an equal and
yet it had gone the rounds and could
find no one willing to publish it

  the silver menace by murray
leinster unexpected by junius b
smith a mystery downstairs
by francisco curtiss and burnt
bridges by clarence l andrews-
stories you ill find in this number-
are all out of the ordinary entirely di-
vorced from the average trend of pres-
ent-day fiction and powerfully written

  as one reader said in a letter re-
cently thank the lucky fates that
we have the thrill book at last
an opportunity for the extraordinary
and occult to find the light of day

thrilling experiences

ront fail to read the announcement
in this issue of a new department
which we are about to establish it
will be called thrilling ex-
periences and will be devoted to
the personal accounts of those who
have had exciting curious and not eas-
ily explained adventures

  we have been receiving so many let-
ters containing bits of personal history
along these lines that we thought it was
about time to collect the material and
ask for more

soldiers sailors and marines

a lthough we have discontinued
the department devoted to sol-
diers sailors and marines we wish
to say that the officer who conducted
it is always ready to offer his advice
to any one who requests it we will
even print any letter that warrants gen-
eral consideration the officer in ques-
tion has had quite a few years experi-
ence in the army and he has made a
study of paper work courts-martial
law and the customs of the service
dont hesitate to make use of this op-
portunity to straighten out any tangle
that may be worrying you
