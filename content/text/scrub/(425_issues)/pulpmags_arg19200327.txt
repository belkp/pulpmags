how would u like to earn
     next week

         col s w wilke did it in one day and in  years
         jumped to almost  a year s e gibson
         jumped his earnings from  to  a month o b

          sheppard says it was worth more than  to him

         let me send you my secret of earning more money
         to try  days free all you risk is a -cent stamp 

                by a l pelton

 my name is pelton-albert l pelton four
 years ago i was as poor as a church mouse
 i was out of a job  in debt and my
 wife and two children were living on starvation ra-
 tions yes ive know the bitterest kind of want

 today i have money and all that money will buy
 i have my own home i have no worries about high
 prices of food or clothing or rent

 even if i never make another nickel i dont think
 i will ever have to worry about money matters

 during the past three years i have been making on
 an average of over a thousand dollars a week

 thats quite a change from the time i was  on my
 uppers isnt it

 now let me tell you how i did it

 you will probably think im funny when i tell you
 that for twelve years i held in my hand the secret
 that at last won me riches

 but its true

 for twelve years i struggled-with gold right in
 my hand

 it was this way

 i used to sell books-from door to door-eking out
 a poor mans living

 one of the books i sold was written by dr frank
 channing haddock

 i never thought much about the book-although i
 sold a few from week to week

 for twelve years i never even took the trouble to
 read it

 it was called  power of will

 i didnt know anything about will-power

 whats more i didnt care

 i thought it might be a good book for fellows who
 had to read it

 but i was too busy earning a living to bother about
 will-power

 probably i thought then as tens of thousands think

 to-day whove heard and read about this great book

 that  will-power  was some myth or impractical
 thing for dreamers

 you see-i hadnt analyzed the lives of the worlds
 greatest men then and discovered that will-power is
 the mightiest force men have ever known

 i was fooling myself-cheating myself fearfully as
 i found out later

 one day i ran across a man who had purchased the
 book from me a few months back

 he stopped me on the street and said  hello pel-
 ton  say i d like to have another copy of that had-
 dock book can you send it up right away

 i told him i would then i asked him casually if
 he liked it

 what he told me made me go home and read the
 book myself-for the first time since i began to sell it
 twelve years before

 that same evening i borrowed 

 the next day i was in new york

 i secured the exclusive selling rights to the book

 then  spent  for a page  ad  in the review
 of reviews magazine

 it brought me about  in cash

 as fast as the money came in i shot it back into
 advertising

 when i got  in cash i bought a half-page
  ad  in the saturday evening post

 the first year i spent  in advertising

 the next year i spent nearly a hundred thousand

 i guess ive spent over half a million dollars since
 my first   ad and already  men and
 women-including great executives international dip-
 lomats famous authors etc also have taken up this
 study

 at first some people said i was crazy to advertise
 that book

 when they found that the book was selling-and

in answering this advertisement it is desirable that you mention this magazine
advertising section

 that i was spending as high as  a month tell-
 ing people about it they said i had more nerve than
 sense

  but my friend all this time i was simply taking
my own medicine

  i was telling people that the will was the motive
power of the brain-that a strong will could batter
down every obstacle to success-that weak will-power
could be made strong as easily as the muscles of the
arm could be made strong-and that most people had
weak wills simply because they didnt use their will-
power

  i had strengthened my own will and was using it
when people were calling me  crazy and it was
my will-power that people called  nerve

  anyway it was the secret of my success without
it i might still be plodding-still canvassing

  or even if i had gotten up enough courage to ad-
vertise i might have made only a pikers success

  it was my will-power that got me the  loan

  it was my will-power that got me exclusive sale of
dr haddocks book

  it was my will-power that made me plunge into
advertising instead of going slowly

  and finally it was my will-power that made me
say to the public- send no money-read  power of
will  five days free pay me if you decide to keep
it send it back if you dont want it

  that was a new sort of proposition to most people
they had nothing to lose-and a lot to gain if the
book was worth while

  so the orders came in by the hundreds and then by
the thousands

  at times i was  orders behind-just couldnt
print books fast enough

  and letters from readers came pouring in so fast i
simply couldnt read them all col s w wilke of
roscoe s d wrote that one days study of  power
of will  netted him  cash and that four years
later by using the methods haddock formulated his
earnings had risen to nearly  a year v p
coffin of rochester n y wrote about one month
after getting the book   power of will  already has
produced an increase of  a year in my income
j e gibson of san diego cal said that since read-
ing  power of will  his salary jumped from  to
 a month

  men like judge ben lindsey supreme court jus-
tice parker assistant postmaster-general britt gov-
ernor mckelvie of nebraska senator capper of kan-
sas secretary of agriculture meredith governor fer-
ris of michigan-and a host of other big men show

the class of leaders who have studied haddocks
methods

  surely there must be something in  power of will 
for you my reader

  it helped me it has helped half a million others
i could send you a circular filled with hundreds of
letters from readers but better still see the book
and read it five days free

  all you lose if you dont think  power of will 
will increase your earnings is a two-cent stamp

  it may make  for you next week-it might
carry you upwards to  or  in a few
years-i dont know i do know it has made a lot
of money for its readers

  i do know too that if you pass this offer by-if
you are a scoffer and a doubter-i will lose only the
small profit on the sale of a book but you-you may
lose the difference between peanut money and real
money

  it costs only a two-cent stamp to mail the coupon

  dont wait twelve years-as i did you may have
gold within your reach and not know it send for
power of will now youve seen my ads before
-now answer this one and see if this masterful vol-
ume doesnt contain the one little push you may need
to make your life rosy-red begin training your will

the ultona

the tone amplifier

 two great advancements in
 phonographic art

  the nation-wide success of brunswick
phonographs is due largely to the ultona
and the brunswick tone amplifier-two
features of the brunswick method of
reproduction

  these came out at a time when better-
ments seemed impossible the ultona
distinguished the brunswick as an all-
record phonograph-an idea now practi-
cally universal

  but no one can duplicate the ultona
for it is a brunswick patent at the turn
of a hand it presents to each make of
record the proper diaphragm the proper
needle it brings out tones hitherto lost
each record is heard at its best

  the brunswick tone amplifier brought
better tone it is made entirely of wood
we abandoned the old-time idea of a
metal throat thus by adopting the violin
principle tone waves are given proper
acoustic staging

  brunswick tone brings fullness richness
clarity we avoid harsh and strident
notes

  there is only one way to fully appre-
ciate the brunswick that is to hear
it and then hear others your own ear
will immediately appreciate brunswick
superiority this is the unfailing test
which has put thousands and thousands
of brunswicks in homes the nation over

the brunsyvick-balke-collender company
general offices - south wabash ave chicago
branch houses in principal cities of united states mexico and canada
canadian distributors musical merchandise sales co  yonge street toronto

now a triumph in records

  the time has come after years of preparation when bruns-
wick records are now on sale again we create new standards
we offer interpretations by noted directors thus we unite
the talent of the artist with the genius of the composer
it brings the final link in authoritative renditions again
let us suggest that your own ear decide upon the merit of
brunswick records

chapter i

 the jailbird

leaning forward against the steering-
wheel of his wicked-looking roadster
tony fane heard the mysterious let-
ter from the scarlet rider crackle in his
pocket an unneeded reminder of his pres-
ence on fifth avenue at this time in the
morning by straining his eyes he could
just see that the hands of the big clock
outside the golden trust company pointed
to six minutes after eleven

  but it did not need any straining at all
to see that there was a man standing be-
neath the clock straight as a sentinel silent
as the sphinx if only his patience would
hold out for a minute longer tony thought
to give him time to get there

  he glanced with unconcealed irritation
at the traffic-cop so needlessly keeping him
on the curb and suddenly seeing a path
made in the line of vehicles by a machine
that turned at the corner he decided to
dash for it

  there was a shout yells from the by-
standers and tony knew that the chase

had begun but he didnt care he could
see the man beneath the clock moving
away and there were still four blocks to
go if the scarlet rider was lost in the
crowd there might never be another chance
to find him and not for all the fines in
the world would tony miss him with a
sudden spurt he passed the clock which
had been the place of rendezvous and drew
up with a flourish just behind the slim
figure of the man who had sauntered off at
seven minutes after the hour

   say he called in a friendly voice
 wait a minute wont you im late but
just as soon as ivefinished with the cop-
he turned with a grin toward the kate
officer of the law

  few could look into tony fanes eyes
when he was laughing and not laugh too
but the policeman had his dignity to main-
tain in the face of the curious crowd and
he stiffened rigidly tonys hand went
toward his pocket he brought out a visit-
ing-card reading it the policeman unbent
a trifle he waved the crowd away it
was in a comparatively clear region that
tony made his explanation

 akoosy




the argosy

   im really awfully sorry officer he
said  but the matter was urgent you
know practically life or death might be
anyway i had an appointment to meet a
man outside the golden trust company
at eleven got held up by the traffic every
place never had such a time in my life
pon my honor then just as i came in sight
of the place and found he was still there
though it was six minutes after the time-
well i got desperate and made a dash
for it of course anything i can do -
he made a disarming gesture toward his
pocket

   well your explanation is certainly
all right sir no i couldnt think of it --
waving away the hand that now swooped
toward him from the pocket with a free
and generous gesture- it was my duty
and of course order must be maintained
but if you ever want anything from clegg
-thats my name-you call on me mr
fane i hope you didnt lose your friend

   i may take you at your word you
know tony laughed taking out his
pocketbook and making a note in it with a
small ivory pencil  awfully dangerous
thing to promise me help im so often
in hot water where are you stationed
clegg what about my coming to see you
when you arent fenced in by duty

  the rubicund countenance of the officer
took on a deeper hue he chuckled  well
now mr fane if you feel that way sir
heres my address and im sure im much
obliged i think your friends waiting
too

  not staying for more he hurried back
to his post but if he had waited he might
have been curious for tony turning to
confront a total stranger cried out in
amazement grasping with a mighty grip the
hand outstretched to him

   hello david where on earth did you
spring from

  for the moment he forgot everything ex-
cept his pleasure in the unexpected sight
of his old friend then as david answered
his question he looked beyond him anxi-
ously  say you didnt frighten that fel-
low off did you awfully shy bird i guess
he was waiting for me under the golden
trust clock i chased him on up here-

  no one appeared in the surrounding
group of passers-by in the least like the
slender figure tony remembered following
up the avenue for four blocks he turned
back to david with a little frown between
his brows then suddenly as he looked
an expression of amazement spread over
his features his eyes deep-blue eyes that
were changeful as the sea gazed into
davids gray ones he took his hand again
and wrung it silently

   old man he said quietly all the usual
exuberance gone from voice and manner
 i didnt recognize you at first

  i knew your voice tony the minute
you called out its mighty fine to hear
it again after-

  whatever he had been going to say tony
interrupted  five years he said he
turned to the car and opened the door
 guess you wont mind riding with me
he said  though i did nearly get arrested
just now fine thing for me clegg hap-
pened to be a good sort last time i was
in the speeders court the judge said next
time he wouldnt fine me hed send me to
jail they call this car  the blue devil
one of the policemen told me shes a
pretty good goer at that

  david settled back in the seat next the
driver laughing it seemed to be sufficient
answer and tony flashed a swift glance
at him they had come now to a busy
section of the avenue and speech was su-
perfluous also the minds of both men
were busy what exactly was the situa-
tion

  red glowed in tonys face for an in-
stant he cursed himself silently for a
blundering fool why overcome suddenly
by the realization that david cortland his
old college chum was an ex-convict brought
to desperate straights too since leaving
prison could he have hit on no pleasanter
subject for conversation than his own prom-
ised term in jail

  his mind was in a whirl he had gone
to meet a stranger a man who had ap-
pealed to him and to others according to
his letter and thus to meet-david it was
enough to make any one bewildered be-
sides-then he left off wondering an old
seven minutes after



axiom of his fathers occurred to him
 when in doubt -old abraham fane had
often thundered- dont

  it was a pretty good hint to work on
tony was in doubt what to say how to
ask anything hed let david do the talk-
ing and if david didnt know how to talk
or wished to be silent that was enough for
tony fane he wasnt supposed to be
brainy or anything like that but by jingo
he could be loyal to his friends and a friend
down and out-his jaw set grimly hed
show them by  them  he meant the
world that had treated david badly

  taking a sudden turn to the right after
they left washington square tony drove
rapidly through a side street to david it
looked unutterably dreary and drab bits
of paper were lying about unwashed chil-
dren ran shrieking across the street play-
ing tag apparently with the low blue car
driven with such reckless ease- and as if
he read his thought tony turned to him
with a grin

   its fashionable to have a studio or
something in this region he said two
years ago i was bitten by the greenwich
village bug and came down here then
i got used to it and never moved out
foo chah lives here all the time i only
come now and again but it has its merits
as a place to chum in at the club you are
everlastingly interrupted since dear old
dad died i havent opened the house much
the old place doesnt seem like home with-
out him

   i wrote to you-when i heard said
david  but it was months after in an old
paper before the news came to me we
didnt get much at first

   i guess not said tony  well here
we are

  he drew the car up before a high brick
house with square windows picked out in
vivid green and whistled the door opened
almost at once and foo chah his emaci-
ated chinese body clad in the decorous
black silk garment of the oriental house-
man ambled swiftly down the irregular
pathway to the sidewalk

   foo chah you remember mr david
said fane  hes back again you see
now hurry to the garage with the car and

then get us breakfast im ravenous i
could eat you almost

  foo chah grinned  bleakfast all
leady he said and climbing into the blue
devil he headed away down the street
looking after him the two friends laughed
there was something anomalous in the
sight of the oriental seated at the wheel
of that up-to-the-minute racing car tooling
her with the surety of a professional chauf-
feur	

   see my tree said tony as they stood
on the door-step while he searched for his
latch-key  they charge me fifty dollars
a month extra for that unofficially of
course

  he nodded at the struggling smoking
maple that grew in the pocket-handkerchief
of green before the house and threw open
the door david stepped into a high nar-
row hallway from which shut off by solid
oak doors the living rooms opened they
walked into the studio

  david stopped on the threshold and
laughed

   whew  said he drawing a long breath
 you certainly got em bad

   everything said tony delightedly
 futuristic stuff cabalistic erotic all the
fads sure i got em what else makes
them think me an artist id like to know
youve got to bluff the commercial public
he drew forward an easy chair uphol-
stered in vivid orange velvet and patted
the back invitingly  horrible to look at
i know but deuced comfortable to sit in
try it

  david sank back with a sigh of relief
for an instant he closed his eyes then
he opened them again-those wide gray
eyes that somehow reminded tony of rob-
inetta davids little sister-and sat up
 theres one thing i want to ask you
tony old man-

  you cant-until after breakfast tony
said positively  im a bear until ive
eaten foo chah will tell you if it hadnt
been for my friendship for you-old-time
stuff and all that kind of thing dont you
know-i never should have got out so early
this morning

  david interpolated ironically  but i
thought you were surprised to see me


the argosy

   i was but thats another of the things
well talk about after breakfast dave i
heard foo chah come back i think ex-
cuse me for a minute

  left alone david considered the situa-
tion his appearance of extreme youth was
not borne out when one looked closer
there were fine lines beneath the eyes
marks of pain at the corners of the nostrils
and the temples it was still the face of a
young man because david cortland had
something of the old indomitable fighting
spirit that never ages but it was not es-
sentially a young mans face still the
lines of humor were strongly marked and
as david considered the situation he re-
laxed until even his eyes were smiling

   must have been something of a knock-
out for tony he said to himself  but he
certainly is a sportsman what a time
robin  have over it when i tell her
whew if i had left that stand under the
clock just one minute sooner none of this
would have happened and i should have
felt sore and as if nobody cared for long
enough poor old tony expecting to find
a stranger a down-and-out desperate vil-
lain i never shall forget how he looked
when he understood i was the man if
there is any way on earth for me to make
it up to him-

  his soliloquy was interrupted by the
breezy entrance of his host

  lord david he said foo chah
must have known you were coming he
has mushrooms and lamb cutlets for break-
fast if you cant eat a whale of a meal
when foo chah cooks cutlets and mush-
rooms theres something wrong with you
believe me

  david laughed  i can but ill call it
lunch i ate my breakfast at seven-
robinetta is very severe with me now that
she has me back again -an expression that
tony could not decipher flitted across his
face- she makes me keep early hours at
each end of the day

   makes said tony  that baby
makes you doanything

   baby well dont let robin hear you
thats all she was twenty last birthday
i bet you a box of cigars tony fane that
robin could make you or any other rea-

sonable man do anything she made up her
mind to and whats more youd enjoy
doing it

chapter ii

an amazing disclosure

dreakfast had been over for an hour
when at last tony turned in his chair
and looked at david with a direct alert
gaze

   well out with it old man ive made
you swallow your story long enough
david cortland took a long pull at his
cigar watched the cloud of smoke disap-
pear and looked at his friend his expres-
sion was keen and searching but his eyes
smiled  have you found em yet he
countered

   found what

  the marks of the jail-bird

   rot tony stood up impulsively  i
dont care what you were imprisoned for
david because i know you never did a
thing in your life to be ashamed of but
i want you to know that i am going to
earth out the dirty scoundrels who made
you suffer and beat em up ill do that
if its the last thing i do on earth so help
me god he changed to a lighter tone
 and dont tell me anything you dont
want to i merely mention it because in
your letter-

   what letter have you it with you
 certainly tony laughed uncomfor-
tably  it gave me a bit of a jolt you
know finding it came from you was
there any need to tell me in such a round-
about way if youd sent me word where
you were these last five years do you think
it would have taken me long to get to you
has every one turned you down so that you
distrusted the whole world even me
tony fane forgetting the dictum of old
abraham stood with his back to the fire
and said what was in his mind his color
was high his blue eyes flamed he re-
minded david of the boy who had won
the college marathon seven years before
who cheered and lauded by the crowd had
stood so and yelled for the university turn-
ing the cheers away from himself
seven minutes after



  he had never been very much famed
for his intellect jogging along through his
classes -with a fair average only but he
had been a sportsman and an athlete and
now with the keenness engendered by years
of life in the old world battling against
evils unseen and monstrous david realized
that tonys brain was a fine weapon too
since he had discovered who had been
under the clock that morning hed been
doing some thinking with a vengeance

  tie held out his hand for the letter

   let me read it first tony

   wait a minute fane turned the en-
velope so that his friend could see it  i
know this isnt your handwriting you dis-
guised it on purpose i suppose or got some
one else to address it and then you typed
the rest that isnt what im complaining
about dave its the way you sent it why
did you let it go to willard i tell you
i felt like a skunk when he gave me the
thing

   did willard fane bring you that

   yes gave it to me last night came over
to the club on purpose found me on the
point of going home  say he said-you
know that nasty sneering way he has- i
imagine i have inadvertently opened a let-
ter intended for you cousin but it was
brought to my chambers -the bally idiot
always speaks of his place as  chambers
some ridiculous word he brought back from
london- and naturally -he cocked up
his eyebrows in that affected way he has
that always makes me want to punch his
head and handed me your letter i opened
it while he was there too and let him watch
me read it he gave me some free advice
when id done said id better turn the
thing over to the police

   instead-

  tony fidgeted uncomfortably  oh
im not a charitable institution i thought
of it of course anonymous letters never
made a big hit with dad they dont with
me either but that letter had something
aboutit that touched me when i had read
it i said to myself that whoever the per-
son was who wrote it he was in trouble
and on the verge of something desperate-
if i could help him- fane broke off in
embarrassment  so i drove down here

and made foo chah get me up early id
have been at the clock in time but for the
jam in the traffic

 david nodded  when i caught sight
of you racing past every one and defying
all rules i didnt know who it was of course
but i had the feeling that the driver of
that blue car was headed for me i watched
you for a minute then i thought id bet-
ter get out of the way im not very fond
of the police	

 he bent over the letter it was badly
typed on cheap paper but it had the ring
of sincerity

 to mr antony fane

    my dear sir

      i just come out of prison i done four and
  a half years and that was six months off for
  good conduct i come out with a new suit of
  clothes and a little money what i earned but
  they wont let me go away from new york til
  i am off parole i got to report to the judge
  every month for three months more i swear
  before god that what i was in for was a plant
  and i never done it some of the police high
  up knows this and wont leave me go if i
  start to get a job they are after me i cant get
  no wort and i aint a city man i dont know
  the ways the gang of a man i was in prison
  with is the only friends i gat

    i learnt a lot while i was in prison and five
  of the best criminals there-i mean the clever-
  est crooks-told me their dream jobs thats
  what they call them it means the big crime
  they want to do more than anything the big
  sure-fire scheme they have brooded over and
  thought out and thought out until there isnt
  any place it can go wrong when they come
  out they are going to pull them off

    the gang got a scheme to have me tell them
  about each job then theyll pull em off and
  make me master of the gang the men what
  thought em up will hav half the money
  they wont have no need to tramp the city
  looking for work with ail the bulls against
  them when they get out of jail

    that influences me some because its a hard
  thing to do

    i came from out west right near where you
  mines are out at shepherd mr fane and i
  knowd you when you was a kid i sure would
  like to get back to that country it is out open
  and a fellow can breathe some without auto-
  mobiles swallowing up the air also there aint
  no police only the sheriff his name is bill
  ponce and he knows me real well if id been
  jailed there i could of come out and gone to
  work for him right away if id a mind to

    folks is built different away from the cities
  mr fane i will not take up with the gang
  and be master which is a compliment after all


the argosy

  and i like that part of it fine-if i can go back
  to the shepherd country if you spoke a word
  to the judge he would let me go maybe and i
  could report to him by letter which is a better
  plan for the bulls would not know it

   to-morrow i shall stand under the clock
 outside the golden trust company on fifth
 avenue i shall be there at eleven oclock ex-
 actly and i shall stand straight and silent un-
 der the figure twelve ill be there until five
 minutes after the hour im afraid of standing
 long because of the police spotting me then
 if you are going to help me you will meet me
 there and if you speak to the judge for me i
 can leave the city i dont want any money
 from you but it seems like you might be able
 to use your influence and i will hand over
 to you a paper i wrote out the dream jobs on

 i carry it next me all the time

   i	believe you will come to help me mr
 fane you or some of the others im writing
 to six other influential gentlemen what must
 know the right thing but id like it best to be
 some one what knows shepherd god but i
 love that country-seems as if only your fa-
 ther what is dead and gone luiowed what i
 feel about it he was a powerful fine man

                  your respectful friend

                      the scarlet rides

 david read the letter through slowly and
 laid it aside with a sigh tony had been
 standing with his back to him wthile he
 perused it looking out of the window but
 now he turned impatiently

  one thing he said  i simply have to
 ask why did you disguise yourself that
 way bad english all the rest of it were
 you afraid of the gang if you had said

  tony im just out of jail im david cort-
 land from shepherd mines who played
 with you when you were a kid and went to
 college with you that would have been all
 that was necessary id have gone to the
 ends of the earth to meet you and youd
 never need to have told me another thing
 if it had not been for his earnestness
 david would have laughed but instead
 something caught him by the throat and
 he had to swallow hard before he could
 speak he rose impulsively from his chair
 and put a hand on his friends shoulder

    tony you dear old simpleton he said
  ill tell you why i never wrote that let-
 ter i was never in prison in my life

   then-

  i know it all fitted in so nicely you
 saw me five and a half years ago and i

vowed vengeance then on my fathers
memory you knew how he had been
served how as chief of police he had been
disgraced and dishonored so that he died
of a broken heart as truly as any one ever
did you know that when the funeral was
over i found papers which seemed to point
to malone-who succeeded him-as the
culprit

   and then i disappeared i had been
your great chum and not a iftord out of
me for five years except that letter-so
long delayed-i sent you when your father
died and suddenly you see me in the
place of the man who wrote you that letter
and it leaps to- your mind that id been
wrongfully accused of a crime and that the
 police high up  know this and are onto
me

   of course you thought of malone and
with your usual generous methodof pro-
cedure you identified me with the man who
needed your help tony youre a brick
and the most loyal friend in the world but
you certainly do butt your head against
a stone wall or two at times you used
to you remember when you played foot-
ball its a useful trick

  tony was desperately embarrassed his
fair skin was dyed crimson has collar sud-
denly seemed to choke him he squirmed
under davids lialf-ironical wholly amused
gaze then unable to resist the impulse
he sank down in a chair and laughed

   great jehoshaphat  he yelled  then
it was not you i saw under the clock at all
i just jumped at the whole darned thing

  no you saw me there all right i
stepped in and stood there at six minutes
after eleven to see if anything would hap-
pen you see i was one of the six men
besides yourself who had one of those let-
ters i got there by ten forty-five i swear
no one made even the slightest attempt to
stand there under the clock and as far as
i could see we were the only two who made
any attempt to answer them i should
think it was all a hoax or something worse
but for one thing

  he took a bundle of letters from his
pocket and sorting out one laid it on the
table

   here you see is the facsimile of the
seven minutes after



letter you received but there is one thing
different tony the thing that makes me
feel it is real on the back page there
are seven names penciled and yours and
mine are among them i think thats the
list the poor fellow used you see he wrote
to van haven winter smith bellamy tom
pedley and to us

    i thought at first the thing was a plant
to get us to the clock and- oh whats
the use of talking about it he broke off
abruptly  it isnt any real help but with
these others in on it-you and i chosen be-
cause we know the shepherd country-
though if you didnt youd belong in that list
simply because youre a multimillionaire
and the others because they are interna-
tional names of importance-why that
doesnt seem possible besides the letter
rings true no one could be quite as in-
genuous as that merely by trying tony
i wonder if you know how sick at heart
i should have been if you hadnt come to
keep that appointment 

  tony laughed  the only reason i
mightnt would have been because i was
out of town and hadnt received the let-
ter he said  even as a kid i was a soft-
hearted sort of sucker i guess dear old dad
always felt it was against me i know

   i knew you were in town though be-
cause robin saw you we were driving
up from the station yesterday when you
slid by in that blue devil of yours robin
called to you but you had gone like a puff
of smoke we tried to get you on the
phone later but they didnt know when
you would be in at the club i left a mes-
sage for you to call the primalto but didnt
give my name i wanted to surprise you

   you did that all right

  laughter broke out afresh they tramped
the long room together for a moment in a
paroxysm of mirth just as they had so
often done in the past but then it had
been david who steadied first now it was
tony

   i wonder he said quietly  what has
become of that poor chap why didnt
he get to the rendezvous do you think
the gang he speaks of stopped him or the
police and why didnt somebody else
make an attempt to help him out take

pedley now hes just the sort to take up
a matter like that why wasnt he in on it
hes in town

   he probably wouldnt get the letter
until to-day at the earliest it would go
through his secretarys hands you know
how long it is before requests for money
reach the eyes of a great financier the
slush has all to be weeded out first that
is what a secretarys for isnt it

  with a mutual comprehension of the
overburdened life of the very rich they
smiled at each other then tony stopped
suddenly and caught up the telephone

   say he said  i have an idea lets
phone the other six and get them after this
thing we shall at least have their ideas
on the mystery

  with his hand on the receiver he
stopped voices were heard in the hall
with a gesture of resignation he whispered
a name

    lord its araminta  he said

  david gave one despairing glance
around but the way of escape was closed
the last thing he wanted to do at this mo-
ment was to meet an unknown woman
foo chah was heard explaining that mr
fane was engaged and in return a wo-
mans voice a rather high metallic but
withal languidly sweet voice-made the as-
sertion that mr fane was never too much
engaged to see her he had said so foo
chahs expostulations were useless

  as the door opened david made one
swoop for the letters on the table turned
his back on the incoming visitors and
placed them safely in his pocket why he
did so he had no idea for in another
moment he turned to face the most ra-
diantly beautiful woman he had ever seen
while foo ghah announced decorously in
his high sing-song voice

   missee alaminta lellerby

chapter iii

the  stupid  miss lethejrby

 jhich means said the radiant vision
to whom tony had just presented
him araminta letherby you dont re-
member me mr cortland i can see have


the argosy

i changed in every other way as well as
changing my name

   if id ever met you before miss leth-
erby i shouldnt have forgotten it said
david simply

   delightful doesnt he say nice
things tony and just as if he was swear-
ing on the bible or something quite
european isnt it most american men
mr cortland are so crude

   crudity is necessary sometimes ara-
minta sweet one said tony  and cort-
land is all american youll find and proud
of it ive known him cruder than you
would ever countenance do you remem-
iber when he boxed your ears out at shep-
herd for tormenting that goat
aramintas eyes smiled languidly the
dark fringes drooped over them for an in-
stant lifting again as she met davids
amazed stare  what a little fiend i was
now you remember dont you david

   minta he cried amazedly  little
minta crane the child who used to stay
down at the cabin and came up to play
with us why its impossible

   but delightful isnt it araminta
drawled  just think if id been com-
pelled to stay minta crane with that
fiendish temper and no clothes or any-
thing i had a rich uncle david who left
me his money on condition i became a
letherby its a much nicer name than
crane anyhow dont you agree with me
and clothes do make a difference

  she looked down complacently at the
suit of wistaria-colored velvet she wore
and allowed the deep cape of chinchilla to
fall from her shoulders as david recov-
ered it she let it remain in his hands for a
second longer than necessary impalpably
fragrant elusive delicate and lovely as its
owner and once again her eyes met his
and david smiled with the vivid boyishness
that wiped away all appearance of care
from his face he drew a long breath

   i should say that everything around
you added to your loveliness miss lether-
by he said  but as for needing clothes
in the way you mean -he hesitated fin-
ishing with a crudity that he felt no one
could have equaled- if you wore rags you
would be beautiful

  piffle tony laughed  thats a fal-
lacy no artist believes it makes all the
difference how a lovely woman dresses
araminta is known as the most beautiful
woman in new york and the stupidest
tony

  araminta laughed delightedly

    its true david you neednt look so
shocked im used to it i found i couldnt
contend -with the brainy women so i de-
cided to be just as stupid a i felt and
told a few of my best friends so

   it went round new york in a jiffy
they speak of me as stupid araminta
letherby it saves me lots of fuss and i
can work at being a beauty i really enjoy
that

   she shifted her gaze to tony as if chal-
lenging his opinion it was a glance of un-
concealed coquetry tony met it gallantly

   and as david has declared you make
quite a success at it sweetness araminta
im not in a painting mood to-day im not
going on with your portrait besides you
hadnt a sitting you know

  she nodded  i should say not with
david just back her kindling look
showed appreciation of the fact that david
was tonys greatest friend  i didnt come
for that willard fane told me youd had
an extraordinary letter from a crook or
something and what he said made me so
curious i simply had to look you up he
thinks its some new scheme for extorting
money from the gentle philanthropist hes
an odd person that cousin of yours tony
 i wish hed let me alone said tony
 he must be just dippy about you xra-
minta the way he tells you things 

    he is said the girl calmly  and he
amuses me hes coming to dinner to-
night-and thats why i wanted to hear
about this letter what did you do tony
go to the meeting place and all that i
bet you did any crook would have a soft
time who tried to take you in

  the little laugh with which she ended
and the affectionate pat she gave to tonys
sleeve took all malice away from the words

  but something stirred uncomfortably in
davids mind was there any intent in
the words was the implication quite as
innocuous as it pretended over tonys
seven minutes after



shoulder his eyes met aramintas and the
luminous clearness of her gaze the gentle
almost simple expression around her per-
fect mouth reassured and made him
ashamed of his doubt

  araminta was just a charmingly beauti-
ful brainless doll she uttered her words
thoughtlessly but at heart she was sound
he smiled at her as one smiles at a charm-
ing child

   guess ill have to let you see that let-
ter -tony felt in the pockets of his coat-
 doesnt seem to be here what did i do
with it david did you-

   put it in my pocket by mistake have
you looked on the floor stooping david
dexterously dropped the letter to the
ground ascertained that it was the copy
that had been sent to tony and gave it to
him with a smile

  for a second he saw an expression of
amazement cross tonys face for he had
been standing where his friends little ma-
neuver was perfectly plain to him but it
was instantly replaced by a good-humored
smile as he gave the letter to araminta

  the girl handled it daintily her face
wrinkled into a little moue of disdain at the
torn cheap paper but as she read on that
expression of disdain vanished and when
she laid the letter upon the table at last
david saw with a thrill thather eyes were
full of tears she had a heart then to
match her lovely face what did brains
matter in a woman as beautiful and tender

  araminta stood up  oh tony i hope
you did something for the poor fellow
she said eagerly and with an impulsive
gesture she turned the contents of her purse
out on the table

   give him this she said  it is little
enough but it may help him to get a start
ive been so terribly extravagant lately i
cant let you have any more im ashamed
now that i come across need like his
once more she indicated the letter lying
between them

   bless your generous heart said tony
making a handful of the bills and money
and sweeping it back into her purse rais-
ing his eyebrows at some of the denomina-
tions as he did so  theres enough there
to start him in a farm almost but run

along araminta and forget it the scar-
let rider didnt turn up this morning per-
haps he had help through some one else

   perhaps he has been found by the po-
lice or something she stood in perplex-
ity drawing her cloak around her slowly
then her face brightened  i know she
cried  willard can help after all isnt
he assistant to the commissioner of police
oh i know youve always said he didnt
do anything tony thathe was more of a
loafer than any of the rest of that crowd
but dont you see here is a chance for him
to prove himself to show that he really
can be of use after all hed do anything
for me

   that doesnt make him unusual tony
responded  any of us would and you
know it look at david now hes your
abject slave we all were even back in
the days when you had a fiendish temper
and teased my goat but dont try willard
too far he isnt like the rest of us exactly
and as for helping out on this poor devils
case hes already counseled me to put it
into the hands of the police that doesnt
sound exactly sympathetic

   brute he wasnt a bit like that when
he spoke to me this morning though
tony he couldnt remember bits of the
letter-that was what made me curious-
but he thought there might be something
true in it of course he wouldnt have the
interest in it we all have because he wasnt
a child out at shepherd

   its incredible you were david broke

in

   it is to myself sometimes- the eyes
araminta turned on him were very wistful
 other girls could put into words what it
makes them feel the change the difference
it has all made but im so stupid i cant
but david i feel that youd always un-
derstand

  she dropped her voice though tony
stood close beside them david felt for an
instant as if he were alone with araminta
tony turned aside to hide a smile though
he was slightly unaccountably irritated
araminta could try her wiles with success
on all the rest of mankind but somehow
he wanted david to be free from them
david took things so hard another fel-


the argosy

low wouldnt think much of being taken up
by araminta and dropped as she always
dropped every one in the end but david
wouldnt understand it he stepped brisk-
ly forward

   as for willard- he said again
araminta appeared to bring herself back
to the remembrance of his presence with
an effort david was holding her hand as
she said good-by  and you will come
and see me she was saying  tony will
tell you where i live in my uncles old
house on sixty-fifth street

  then she replied to tonys remark

   willard she laughed  hed slipped
from my mind ill be absolutely con-
scienceless and forget that he was to dine
with me ill make anita call him when i
get home and tell him i have a headache
or something and cant see him then
you boys come to dinner instead wont
you please

  she stood back holding her big muff be-
fore her face her two beseeching lovely
eyes brimful of mischief if she had been
beautiful before she was radiant now all
the artist in antony fane recognized it
mentally he groaned what man could
resist such allure he knew araminta
through and through for instance but he
could not

  he glanced at david expectantly his
ready grin already in evidence a mere
formal acknowledgment from himself -would
be all that was necessary david if he
knew the symptoms would jump at the
chance of seeing araminta again that day
and in the intimacy of a family dinner in
her own home

  but david hesitated  thank you he
said you are more than kind but im
afraid i cant you see my little sister
she has been separated from me so long
i cant leave her very well we only re-
turned to new york yesterday

    how stupid of me said araminta
 of course i remember robinetta she
was a toddling baby when i was about-
well lets leave the matter of age out of it
wouldnt she come without a formal call
from me first if i wrote her a note or-
i might call on her this afternoon

  david laughed  robins the most un-

ceremonious creature in the world he said
 if i may bring her with me i know shell
be charmed shes the most astonishing
memory too shell probably know exactly
what you looked like as minta crane and
unless i warn her she will be sure to blurt
out that little matter of age

   gracious said araminta stepping
away in pretended alarm

   even if she does sweetness you should
worry tony said slangilyand as he
walked with her down the narrow pathway
to the waiting car his laugh came back to
david merrily

   holy smoke araminta id give some-
thing to see willards face when anita
phones him he knows you never have a
headache arent you afraid of losing an
adorer

  she shook her head laughing  even
for stupid araminta letherby there are
plenty more she said and her eyes turned
as if against her will back to the window
where david cortland stood

chapter iv

lot 

thrive to the primalto hotel ara-
minta told the chauffeur as the car
turned out of washington square for a
moment she watched the man manipulating
his way through the traffic then with a
half-smile that somehow altered the ex-
pression of her face adding a subtlety to
its beauty that had not been there when
she talked with tony and cortland she
took the paper from her loose-sleeved cape
and opening it proceeded to read again
calmly the letter that had been the cause
of her visit to tonys studio-the letter
from the scarlet rider

  long before the primalto was reached
she had folded it again and placed it in her
hand-bag and when she swept across the
curb and into the palm-shaded lobby of the
hotel famous for its exclusive patronage
and the suavity of its service all hint f
frowning thought had gone from her ex-
pression and she was again only the beau-
tiful araminta letherby new york had
labeled stupid
seven minutes after



  she walked swiftly through the lobby to
the alcove where the telephone operator
sat at the switchboard  chelsea a
if you please she said quietly taking no
notice of the tall unobtrusively dressed
man who had followed her in and now
leaned over the board talking to the curly
haired operator when she received a sig-
nal to enter one of the booths she was ap-
parently careless as to who heard her con-
versation for she left the door open and
said only a few words

   poo chah this is miss letherby put
your master on the wire please and
again after a pause  hello tony this is
araminta  im speaking from the prim-
alto had to come here for a stupid lunch-
eon engagement what oh thats mean
from you it neednt necessarily be stupid
because im there you know i called up
to tell you that i took away the letter you
had-you know from the man who signed
himself the scarlet rider - i must have
swept it off into my bag with my sleeve or
something i hope you hadnt missed it
tony cant you send foo chah for it
im phoning anita to meet me here she
can sit in the lounge and wait for him
no i cant tony i dont like having the
thing about it depresses me all right
good boy thank you very much anita
will be here right away ill tell her to look
out for you yes in about half an hour
good-by

  thoughtfully she hung up the receiver
paid the fee and left the alcove with a
glance at the jeweled watch on her wrist
one oclock lunch was at one thirty
there would be time for what she had
planned she walked up to the mezzanine
floor sought out the homeliest looking of
the stenographers and sat down to dictate

   you take letters straight on the ma-
chine she asked

  the girl nodded she thought she had
never seen any one more beautiful than the
woman before her and her clothes were
perfect enough to make any one gasp even
in that hotel of beautifully gowned women
she fitted a sheet of paper into the ma-
chine without looking at it  you wish a
carbon copy

    it wont be necessary these are merely

a few extracts from a letter i wanted them
typed so that i shouldnt have to copy
them by hand do you want me to talk
slowly

    i think i can take it just as you speak

   araminta dictated from the letter in her
hand then she glanced over the sheet of
typed matter the girl handed to her laid
a five-dollar bill on the machine and rose

   change will not be necessary buy
yourself some candy witli it

   but madame your fee is only thirty-
five cents the stenographer stammered
her brain was hot working as rapidly as
usual she was dazzled by aramintas
beauty and gentleness yet she thought
back rapidly what was it she had taken
down nothing of real value was it no
it had evidently been a personal matter
only something that had been written to
this beauteous person by a dependent of
some sort probably for the grammar had
been poor nothing it was necessary to
report to the house detective she drew a
long breath pushing the five-dollar bill
away from -her

   but i want you to take it-please
araminta looked like a child about to cry
the other girl was sure her lower lip trem-
bled ever so slightly she looked up hesi-
tantly  i have more money than i can
ever spend and once i was a poor girl too

i knew then what a few extra pennies
meant wont you let me- the gentle
deprecating voice trailed off into a wistful
silence

  araminta turned away leaving the girl
at the machine lost in a haze of golden fan-
cies once-she had it from her own lips
-this wonderful person had also been a
poor girl perhaps a stenographer even
and she seemed to know exactly how a
working girl felt anyway

  how wonderful to be rich and to wear
beautiful clothes and be able to be kind
always perhaps her chance too would
come the unfortunates who dictated to
her for the rest of the day wondered what
could have gotten into the usually capable
head

  araminta had miscalculated she had
made a deeper impression than she knew
aiming to bewilder she had stimulated


the argosy

memory not one word of what she had
taken down on the machine escaped the
girls mind and as die fell asleep that
night one name was on her lips she won-
dered drowsily who could be the scarlet
rider it was as attractive romantic name

  anita ferndale was aramintas compan-
ion she did all the things araminta didnt
want to do and stood as a buffer between
that young woman and a kind and indul-
gent world too urgent in pressing its claims
she had one pride her capability say
for an instant that she was not the perfect
social secretary and anita was up in arms
she knew that she could not be bettered
in this capacity and she adored araminta
letherby because she admitted it it
didnt matter whether araminta was in a
good temper or bad she never made the
mistake of depreciating anitas qualities

  in return miss ferndale gave unstinted
good measure for her generous salary and
reserved the right to be as sulky-or saucy
-to the beautiful miss letherby as she
pleased she made one mistake only she
took araminta at the valuation she had set
upon herself she thought her stupid

   i had a message from peters minta
she said coming across the crowded lounge
a few minutes later her trim figure clad in
a nondescript suit of gray the furs about
her shoulders giving the impression of be-
ing unbecoming somehow although ara-
minta herself had chosen them  he said
you needed me here at one twenty-five it
is now exactly that she added

   punctual as usual how do you do it
child there was lazy admiration in
aramintas voice and anita flushed she
sat down on the seat next to her employer
and looked over the crowd

   what are we doing she asked
 something new

   i am araminta drawled  take my
hand-bag like a good girl and find a fold-
ed letter-crumpled paper dirty horrid
thing to touch-yes thats it now i want
you to wait here for mr fane hes coming
in with a friend on their way somewhere
and he wants that letter hes expecting
to see you here comes my escort im
lunching in the gold room ill be home
by four oclock

  she rose from her seat nodded smilingly
across her shoulder at her and left anita
sitting contemplatively with aramintas
hand-bag on her lap and a folded crum-
pled bit of paper clasped in with it but
anita did not mind she had for a won-
der no idea as to who aramintas escort
might be he was tall and thin and aris-
tocratic looking but miss ferndale made
a mental comment as she looked after him

   bet hes the devil of a temper she
told herself inelegantly philosophically
she searched in the hand-bag left in her
care-one of aramintas stupidities she
knew-for bonbons it was late she had
not had luncheon and she knew aramintas
propensity for candy-

  she was rewarded by finding some cakes
of chocolate but they were warm and
sticky to the touch she was annoyed to
be found sucking off the remnants that
had adhered to her fingers when antony
fane stopped beside her for if anita had
a fancy for any man it was for the young
giant before her he was so good-tem-
pered so wholesome so virile she smiled
comically now making a little face of dis-
may

   what a mess to find me in she said
 and you look as if youd come out of a
bandbox as usual miss letherby wanted
me to give you this mr fane

  she handed him the folded paper

  tony thanked her and presented david
cortland both men  were exceedingly
spick and span and anita rose eying them
with sparkling eyes in which mischief
gleamed

   youre evidently going somewhere to
conquer she remarked  and i must go
home dont let me detain you there are
all kinds of beautiful girls waiting

  tony laughed  were going to call on
one-mr cortlands little sister at least
she seems little to me i havent seen her
since she grew up were all dining with
miss letherby to-night you know so well
meet again

   i didnt know glad you told me
anita retorted grimly  araminta expects
me to have second sight about her guests
what sort of a dinner is it to be mr fane
any idea
seven minutes after



   strictly a family affair no need to
worry let the chef have hysterics if he
wants to

   he may hes temperamental anita
laughed with a gay little nod she watched
them walk away two exceedingly smart-
looking men briskly she was turning to-
ward the ladies entrance when she was
aware that the man who had taken ara-
minta to lunch stood at her side

   miss ferndale he interrogated
 yes then if you please miss lether-
by wants her hand-bag she says she left
it with you

  anita gripped it more firmly  i think
ill go with you to give it to her if you
dont mind she said coolly ive no
doubt whatever that miss letherby sent
for it but you see if she had not by any
chance and there always is a chance-then
im responsible and theres more money
in that bag than i could afford to lose im
sure miss letherby is awfully careless
about money

  the man frowned in perplexity  i see
your point he admitted  but er-the
fact is-miss letherby is transacting a
matter of private business and she doesnt
want any one in on it if you will let me
bring her to you-

  anita looked him over coolly he was
evidently a gentleman well-groomed and
distinguished-looking but there was some-
thing about him she did not like more-
over he was new to her and she had not
heard his name his tone too when he
first spoke had been distinctly supercilious
and that was something he was to suffer
for miss ferndale lifted her chin

   certainly not she said icily  miss
letherby cannot be dragged about to search
for her own hand-bags her tone implied
that she was speaking of a queen  be-
sides she is used to me in her private busi-
ness you see that man over there the tall
one leaning over the desk talking to the in-
formation clerk well he telephoned me
to come here and meet miss letherby this
morning his name is peters he is never
far away when miss letherby is in a pub-
lic place she gives him messages and
sends him on errands without ever speak-
ing to him by code of course he knows

me would you prefer me to give this bag
to him

  her companion laughed  you are an
ideal secretary miss ferndale he said
pleasantly  suppose you tell me -that you
are willing to accept the responsibility of
accompanying me and then come along
it wont do to keep miss letherby waiting
she cant do business very well without
that bag

 	m

  stanchly anita followed him but as
she turned the bend in the lounge and
headed for the elevators she turned her
head and made a hurried signal to the tall
lanky man she had indicated as peters
but she had no opportunity of knowing
whether he followed her or not for her es-
cort hurried her into a descending elevator

   down he said sharply

  they found themselves in a concrete
passageway and passed on into a large
room almost blocked with people but
they were not the- people -who filled the cor-
ridors up-stairs this was a crowd of com-
mercial men of one sort and another hawk-
eyed jews down-at-heel women one cr
two quiet matrons who kept together in a
select group and a few who seemed to be
onlookers merely better dressed than the
others less noisy -surveying the rest of the
crowd with appraising eyes

  through all a constant stream of porters
passed and repassed with baggage and a
voice was heard uplifted in exhortation

   what is it asked miss ferndale she
was surprised but not in the least bewil-
dered her companion looked down at
her with twinkling eyes not without their
gleam of malice and the dislike anita had
felt at first suddenly developed into large
proportions she had difficulty in hearing
his reply above the shouting but as she
followed him through the worst of the
wedging pushing mass of humanity the
sound of his words-as sounds will-made
sense to her consciousness  sale of held
baggage he said

   what on earth could araminta want
with other persons luggage she asked
herself for now she sav miss letherby
sitting on a tall black-leather trunk and
eying the scene with bored amusement
she looked more beautiful than usual and


the argosy

more out of place than anita had ever seen
her for she had the faculty that so few
really lovely women have of seeming to
become a part of whatever portion of the
landscape was her temporary setting as
anita approached she looked up with an
expression of astonishment

    willard she said fretfully  i asked
 you to bring the thing s

   she took the purse from anitas hand
 without glancing at -her and the girl smiled
 grimly it was evident she had not pleased
 araminta by coming but at least she had
 satisfied herself that the demand for the
 purse was genuine she didnt wait for the
 man to answer but spoke firmly as one
 speaks to a fractious child

    you had over a thousand dollars in the
 bag when you started off this morning and
 i didnt know this gentleman i insisted
 on bringing it myself if you need any-
 thing of the kind another time write it
 down i know your signature

    but you know said araminta plain-
 tively for the first time letting her lovely
 eyes rest on anitas face how long it
 takes for me to do that i can never ex-
 press myself properly

    asking for a simple hand-bag anita
 almost snorted  you cant make me think
 you as stupid as that any common school-
 child could write enough for that

    if they chose added araminta spite-
 fully and made the nvords a dismissal
 turning her back on her secretary and smil-
 ing up at her companion she had not pre-
 sented him to miss ferndale but anita
 knew who he was now

   willard fane had figured in the papers
 enough for her to chide herself for not hav-
 ing recognized him instantly but the fact
 was he was a bigger man physically than
 his portraits had led her to believe

   as she wended her way alone through
 the crowd she thought out the reason seiz-
 ing upon it with the rapidity with which
 she did everything it was because his
 features were small and refined not as large
 as is usually the case with a tall man it
 gave him a curiously indefinite look she
 reflected and yet from all accounts wil-
 lard fane was anything but that his
 record in the police department lone

 proved him to be aggressive and politic
 both now anita felt him to be unscru-
 pulous

    why hadnt he told her his name she
 asked angrily  and prevented her from
 making such a play for annoyance on
 anitas part she turned to glare at him
 balefully

   but he had disappeared it was only a
 moment since she had seen him standing
 by araminta laughing down at her while
 she coquetted with him there was no
 place they could reasonably have gone for
 the room ended in a concrete wall against
 which the black trunk on which araminta
 had -been sitting now stood out with clear-
 ness and they had certainly not followed
 her back through the crowd

   in her amazement miss ferndale al-
 lowed herself to stop and scan the place
 anxiously araminta could not be lost
 she was too beautiful and too conspicuous
 -but it would be just as well if peters had
 seen her signal and followed her down con-
 sidering willard fanes reputation

    here she heard his voice say softly
 the tall thin man was leaning over the
 edge of a trunk staring up the room at the
 auctioneer apparently he had not moved
 his lips and he certainly had not glanced
 in -her direction he was the same picture
 of awkward ease that he had been in the-
 lobby up-stairs earlier in the day in the
 telephone alcove and as he had been on
 the score of times only that anita had seen
 him

   he -had always amused her rather and
 to araminta she spoke of him as  the
 yank always he was not unlike the
 usual picturized ideas of uncle sam but
 without the goatee yet in one gesture he
 had always seemed to anita to be pulling
 at that imaginary beard

   he did not seem to be looking at her
 and yet anita knew that he had spoken to
 her she edged her way through the crowd
 and stood beside him following the direc-
 tion of his glance without speaking

 the auctioneer was disposing of his
 wares rapidly it was evident that he had
 another appointment and did not mean to
 waste more time than necessary on this
 one it was unusual to hold an auction on
seven minutes after



the hotel premises and he did not approve
of it he had told the management that
if a hall was hired as usual the baggage
would fetch more money he meant to
act so that his words would prove true and
on the next occasion he could work in a
hall from the rent of which he could graft
a nice little sum but he had to be guard-
ed about it or the hotel officials would get
on to his game

   he glanced perfunctorily at the small
trunk and old grip labeled  lot  that
now was placed before him and began his
offer for bids his hammer already poised
to knock it down for a few dollars then
to his surprise a cultured drawling voice
said  twenty dollars

   miss ferndale recognized the voice but
she could not understand it what could
willard fane want with an old battered
trunk that looked as if it came off the prai-
ries it was evidently home-made on the
end nearest her the initials s t r had
been painted by some one who knew little
about the art of lettering also the trunk
was small and the grip that accompanied
it was of the old collapsible pattern that
had followed the still more ancient carpet-
bag it was wrinkled and dusty and alto-
gether undesirable at the most it might
be worth ten dollars yet he had bidden
twenty she turned to peters whispering
a question

    is miss letherby there too

  peters nodded he was smiling as one
smiles at a spoilt child miss ferndale
smiled back understanding the cause of -his
mirth she had felt that way about ara-
minta often when some whim seized her to
possess something bizarre and unsatisfac-
tory-a whim that she would move heaven
and earth to satisfy her quick brain rea-
soned it out something like this which was
surprisingly near the truth too as peters
informed her later

   in some way araminta had heard of this
auction of baggage held by the hotel in lieu
of unpaid accounts and insisted on attend-
ing it then whimsical as ever she had
set her heart on this absurd small trunk
with the hall-marks of western origin and
willard fane had undertaken to get it for
her

   it was a perverse desire t hide her child-
ish wish from her secretary that had made
her sulky just now

  with her lips curving in a smile anita
stayed until the wily auctioneer getting
somewhere near the truth had run the
price up to fifty dollars doing it so swiftly
too that the rest of the crowd had very little
interest in it

  the bag and trunk became the property
of miss letherby with a suddenness that
surprised the watchers unsuspected in the
background peters once more made that
gesture of pulling at his beard and miss
ferndale moved away quietly it did not
surprise her that the man followed and
stood with her waiting for the elevator
even though in the six months since he had
become an unacknowledged member of ara-
mintas staff he had never talked with miss
ferndale face to face

  but there had been something in the
small incident to draw them together ara-
minta had done something so senseless so
supremely foolish these employees of hers
could scarcely refrain from comment

  however miss ferndale always a trifle
curious about this secret body-guard of
aramintas found peters a  silent com-
panion he accompanied her to the stage
walking over to fifth avenue from the
primalto and scarcely speaking as they
crossed the park except to tell the secretary
about the conversation which had led to
the desire araminta had just gratified to
attend the auction but as they waited for
the bus he asked a question looking down
into her face with eyes that anita found
could be very searching

 what do you think of willard fane
 i only saw him to-day for the first time

i dont think-i like him

   hes a damned crook said peters be-
tween his teeth

chapter v

diana-and her weapon

jm r cortland is wanted on the
     telephone madam

 that must be my sister said david
xcusing himself a sigh of relief went


the argosy

round the little group in aramintas draw-
ing-room even the most informal of
dinner parties is not improved by unpunc-
tuality on the part of one of the guests and
for fifteen minutes now every one had been
waiting for robinetta cortland to appear

  even the arrival of the cocktails had not
saved the situation for tony had still re-
mained gloomy and david had been dis-
tressed at his sisters absence begging his
hostess not to wait dinner

   i cant think what has come to robin
he had said  she promised to meet me
here she is the most punctual person too
uncomfortably so almost

   arent you afraid something has hap-
pened to her tony had roused himself
from gloom to ask he had fallen a ready
prey to robins charm during his call upon
her that afternoon and had come into
aramintas house absurdly early with an
eager expression in his eyes that miss
letherby had at once noticed she laughed
at him openly now

   tony as if a modern girl couldnt take
care of herself

   robinetta can said david with a
laugh  out west she had to you know
she was all alone

   of course you were in-- the slight
pause was evidently an invitation for infor-
mation david took advantage of the op-
portunity it gave him to address his hostess
directly by answering as he crossed the room
to a seat at her side

   in europe

   and your sister was alone out west
the accent was almost anxiously concerned
david thought it another mark of tender-
ness in this adorable woman that she should
be concerned about the lonesome life of a
scarcely remembered girl  of course she
was at school most of the time he smiled

    still said tony interrupting pessimis-
tically on the main issue new york is
new york you know its a bit different
from the west i wouldnt let a sister of
mine go around alone in this city

   dont say that to robinetta

   is your sister so militant asked ara-
minta her eyes were soft as velvet to-
night david thought as he answered her
evening gown was simple in his masculine

innocence he thought that an ingenue might
have worn it not recognizing the art of the
swirling golden draperies and the big sash
of dull gray velvet caught with an opal pin

  the opal earnings she wore gleamed rosy
and blue and gray as they caught the color
of cheeks and eyes and girdle david
thought but not even the gleam of deepest
blue in any jewel could match the depth of
aramintas eyes	

  his voice breathed his admiration and
araminta half smiled she had seen that
expression too often in mens eyes not to
know its meaning

  in a corner anita watched the little scene
without criticism she had sometimes won-
dered why it was that men preferred beauty
to brains but it seemed to be an irrefutable
fact

  the announcement of the phone-call
came as a relief tony grinned catching
aramintas eye as david returned all
looked at him eagerly tony because he
could scarcely wait to hear news of his new
divinity anita because having missed her
luncheon she was desperately hungry ara-
minta out of real curiosity to see this young
girl whom her brother adored and tony-
an artist after all - considered lovely
enough to admire she might be stupid but
araminta had a very certain belief in
tonys artistic sense

   it was robin she telephoned to say
that she had a breakdown with the car and
could not possibly get here for twenty
minutes if she stayed to dress i took the
liberty of telling her to come as she is i
hope you dont mind miss letherby

   im delighted said araminta with a
sincerity that brought a little cynical smile
to her secretarys lips

  almost as she spoke the butler opened
the door and announced  miss cortland
a slender girl entered swiftly her eyes
searching for her hostess she seemed to
be dazzled a little by the brilliant lights of
the room-araminta insisted upon bright-
ness always she had no need of a subdued
light-and paused on the threshold

  david took her hand presenting her to
miss letherby  why robin said he
you came on the wings of the wind i
had only just come back from the phonfe


seven minutes after	

  robinetta her hand still in aramintas
soft cordial clasp laughed softly  i tele-
phoned from next door she explained  i
made a mistake in the house they were
having a dinner-party and i caught sight
of the women trailing out to the dining-
room it made me remember that i was
not dressed so i asked the man if  might
telephone i must ask your pardon for
coming like this she added directlyto her
hostess

  even araminta laughed thre was some-
thing so naive in getting as far as  next
door and then remembering her lack of
suitable clothing tony grinned his wide
infectious grin

  youre giving your brother away e
everything miss cortland he announced
 he made a pretty apology for himself
permitting you to come this way

  it was a merry party by the time dinner
was announced  we havent enough men
to go round said miss letherby  im
afraid youre left anita she smilingly
took davids arm tony so happy that
he was now grinning foolishly took robi-
netta on his right and anita at the left
somehow with the coming of this slender
bright-eyed girl in street garb an air of
gaiety had invaded the party

   im hungry enough to- robin paused
suddenly as they crossed the hall catching
sight of herself in the mirror that ran from
floor to ceiling in one corner  why i
havent taken off my coat she said the
color rising in her cheeks  and-oh i am
afraid miss letherby will think me too
informal altogether she confided to anita
across tonys broad chest  i only have
riding clothes underneath this

  she touched the coat of covert cloth that
buttoned smartly to her throat

   no indeed said miss ferndale kindly
 miss letherby is too happy to have you
here let us drop the coat here in the
hall simmons

  a young footman came forward and took
the coat robin stood revealed in a fawn-
colored habit that spoke eloquently of the
west the coat came down to her knees
and the smartly cut breeches fastened below
it around the slender rounded knees rid-
ing boots that were ridiculously small cov-

    	ahgosy

ered the dainty feet and ankles and little
golden spurs clinked as she moved

  it was not an eastern riding outfit but
it was an eastern tailors dream of what a
western habit should be anitas trained
eyes saw and it was perfect no need for
robin to apologize for her apparel she
seemed in her slim feminine boyishness
to have been poured into the clothes she
wore and as she moved toward the dining-
room her grace struck mis ferndale dumb

  how many new york girls could have
appeared in such attire without being con-
scious of it she wondered she was a young
diana without dianas sternness

  at the door to the dining-room however
she paused again  oh please when i
have done everything else stupid ive one
more to add to my list ive left something
-something really important in the pocket
of my coat if the footman feels it he will
b scared may i-

   let me get it for you said tony
eagerly

   thanks in the right-hand pocket you
wont miss it she waved anita on into
the dining-room with an airy gesture and
waited for tony with thinly veiled amuse-
ment then her sight was caught and held
by something that was happening in the
back hall she could see it all in the mirror

  a grip-old and wrinkled and worn-was
being taken up the back stairs on the top
of a trunk a little hand-made trunk with
something familiar about it the man hold-
ing the back end stopped a moment to
adjust his hold and turning slightly dis-
played the initials painted in primitive
fashion on the end

s t r

                                              

  robin read impulsively she ran forward
and spoke to the servants in an authorita-
tive tone

  whose trunk is that she said im-
periously

  one of the men laughed  it dont be-
long to no one miss its a new buy of miss
letherbys thats all sheve a fancy for
old junk sometimes

  he hoisted the trunk again displaying
the three letters to her closer sight as he
did so robinetta nodded and turned away
the argosy

all the gaiety gone from her eyes though
she forced her lips into a smile as she saw
tony fane standing waiting in his hand
was a small automatic pistol with a mur-
mured word of thanks robinetta took it
from him and slipped it into her pocket

   its loaded said tony as if he could
not help the comment

  robinettas clear eyes met his was it
fancy or did he see a troubled mist back
of their seriousness he could not be sure
but all through dinner her reply echoed
in hfs consciousness giving a thrill of added
adventure to the adventure of falling in love
with another beautiful girl

   it has to be she said

chapter vi

robin the reckless

rvwid cortland had an appoint-
ment that took him away from ara-
mintas side shortly after nine oclock tony
had promised him to see robinetta home
but the girl turned to him laughing

   i can drop you anywhere you wish mr
fane i have the car and shall be glad to
but im quite capable of going home alone
 my dear said miss letherby her fine
brows raised in amazement  you couldnt
drive yourself alone at night in new york
 but of course-said robinetta com-
posedly

  araminta shuddered  you might be
sandbagged murdered anything she ex-
claimed  i should be scared to death
she gave an unmistakable shudder

  tony was looking at robinetta-he had
done little else the whole evening-and he
saw an expression of amazed inquiry come
into robins face  but i thought-david
told me you were a western girl she ex-
claimed  after the prairies what is there
to be afraid of in the city an old man i
used to know told me there was nothing in
the world big enough to be afraid of and
he guessed there was nothing outside of it
either he was a very wise old man hed
seen a lot of life hed been a convict

   good gracious how did you ever meet
him miss ferndale said

  robinetta considered  i think it was

at a chicken supper at the church she said
and smiled at the laughter following the
announcement  he was a very good old
man too and quite religious those things
dont always go together of course but
they did with old scart

  her eyes were upon araminta as she said
the name and the most beautiful woman
in new york raised a white hand and care-
fully covered a yawn  my dear she
said  you really mustnt talk about persons
of that kind in the city people wont
understand

   oh as to that robinetta chuckled  i
think they would you see scart was very
rich he could have come into new york
any day and broken up a few millionaires
he made all his money after he left sing
sing people here would have said that
he was quaint after they knew how much
money he had

  she faced araminta roguishly laughing
at her own cynicism

   i was at school in the east miss
letherby i understand more than you
think

  ive forgotten where you were edu-
cated said araminta there was a gleam
of malice in her eyes like most beauties
she did not care to see a younger and less
lovely woman win admiration that she had
enjoyed robinetta was interesting to her
because she was davids sister but now
that david had gone she did not relish
seeing tony fane worshiping at her feet

  it had been a nice game to flirt with
him it was always worth while because it
made the other women so wild tony was
the wealthiest and most attractive bachelor
in town

  she was not without forethought when
she asked this question tony was demo-
cratic but he could make distinctions he
must know that this girl was quite impossi-
ble in his heart of hearts to hear that she
had been educated in a little two-by-four
school would cure him of his infatuation
for her absurd naturalness

   did david tell you asked robinetta
surprised  i was at miss seldens of
course

  anita ferndale made a sudden coughing
sound and buried her face in her handker-
seven minutes after



chief araminta had been unable to conceal
her surprise and the situation was amusing
miss seldens seminary was the most exclu-
sive school in new york araminta herself
had never graced its doors probably miss
selden would not have considered her appli-
cation despite her beauty and wealth so
many things had to be taken into considera-
tion before one was admitted to that edu-
cational holy of holies

  she sat up eying robinetta with a new
respect however simple and outspoken
this girl seemed she must be all right since
she had been a pupil at miss seldens

   and you were all alone there for years
she said  while your brother was in
europe

  conflicting emotions showed in miss
cortlands vivid little face she dropped
the sprightliness that she had shown since
davids departure and allowed her real
mood to emerge

   yes she said  if you can ever be
alone in a girls school you see i had
lost my father and david ha gone off to
seek vengeance it was terrible at first

  miss ferndale drew her chair a little
nearer tony wished she wouldnt some-
how this seemed to him a time that they
three-robin araminta in her unexpect-
edly sympathetic mood and himself-might
have had without the addition of the secre-
tary he saw tears in robinettas eyes
held back steadily by force of will

   you remember tony -she called him
by the name david always used without
appearing to notice that she was doing it-
 how hard david took fathers death he
-miss letherby he was commissioner here
head of the best and most efficient police
force new york ever had they say he
was ousted from office and killed-killed
by what they said about him

   some one was responsible for his dis-
grace in the eyes of the world and david
went away vowing to find out and punish
him whoever it was it couldnt have been
more than one or two men at the most
david suspected one he left me in board-
ing-school he thought i was too young to
knowsmuch about it but-at night i used
to think and think you see david didnt
send me many letters

   she lifted her eyes still tear-filled with a
pathetic appeal the more pathetic in that it
was unconscious-for understanding

   of course i was very little she said
 but i vowed vengeance too i used to
spend all my holidays out at shepherd in
idaho roaming over the hills and learning
things from all kinds of people a mexi-
can greaser taught me how to use a stiletto
a few of our own cowboys taught me how
to rope and throw a lariat i can shoot
like a man through my pocket if ever i
meet the hypocrite and thief who broke
papas heart i know what to do to him

   i think youre wonderful said tony
 isnt she aramintas white hand
caught and held the little cold one that had
clenched with the vigor of its owners
speech  but now little girl you mustnt
spend your time thinking thoughts like
these youre due for a happy time laugh-
ter and gaiety love perhaps all the things
we women crave i am stupid i cant
express my thoughts very well but i know
that you can gain more by being womanly
and sweet and gentle than by using-a gun
cant she anita

   i dont exactly know miss ferndale
said  id rather shoot my enemy than
scheme and cajole to catch him

   but i was forgetting about the enemy
miss cortland must do the same if she can
aramintas eyes sought tonys  so young
and lovely and all this bottled up inside
the pretty head

   by jove you know i think miss leth-
erbys right said tony fane he looked
deep into the gray eyes that had recently
been full of tears they were hopeless with
grief for a flash then blazing with fire into
his and suddenly this girl of many moods
western eastern whatever she called her-
self but different-different a thousand
times from any girl he had ever met smiled
at him softly

  you advise me to forget-this she
said

  there on her palm lay that little auto-
matic araminta drew a long breath
anita ferndale uttered a sharp exclamation
and bent over looking at it  loaded
she asked

   loaded always  robinetta affirmed


the argosy

her slender brown hand closed over it and
rising with a little swaggeriag effect of
throwing off a weight she dropped the
revolver in her pocket again and laughed
gaily

   its getting awfully late she said  for
a girl who was up at six oclock and ive
talked more than i ever do thank you so
much miss letherby for letting me and
for-everything now if mr fane is going
to see me home- she flashed a smile at
him

  but out in the street she seemed a differ-
ent person she was grave absorbed it
was dark and across in the park the
shadows were deeply purple except where
the lamps threw long arms of light into the
depths behind them the big house that
miss letherbys uncle had left -her was
darkened suddenly

  tony had the feeling of being all alone
in the world with robin cortland the
roar of new york came to them muffled
subdued

   i wish said tony quietly  that you
were going to ride with me in the blue
devil

  the girl looked at him steadily  per-
haps i am she said in a voice that trem-
bled a little  tony i have to trust you
there is no one else i left too little time to
change my plans while we were in there
some one tampered with this car i cant
get her to start is there any way that i
can get to the golden trust company
quietly and without a fuss by eleven be
careful speak quietly we may be watched
from the house the lights are out see

  tonys nerves steadied themselves he
was as cool as this girl from the west as
he answered

   yes of course but arc you sure about
your car isnt there something i can do
im a pretty fair mechanic

  no im sure i half suspected it at
the last but weve got to see that they
know we dont use it will you go back
to miss letherbys and have one of the
men come and watch the car until we can
send for it miss letherby hasnt a garage
on the place and will you say please that
you are taking me right back to the hotel
through the park its a glorious night

for a walk that ought to be sufficient rea-
son

   i think youd better come with me i
can lie if i have to but im afraid of slip-
ping up on this im with you heart and
soul but i havent much of a brain-piece
dont you know im better at action it
is all a bit bewildering miss robin but
you can trust me-to the death

   all right said the girl she walked
beside him to the great front door her
slender figure erect and graceful and
laughed and chatted with him for the mo-
ment before the door swung back at their
ring a surprised-looking man-servant
opened the door

   its mr fane roberts tony said

 i want one of you men to go out there and
keep an eye on miss cortlands car some-
thing is wrong with it again she had trouble
earlier in the day it isnt necessary to dis-
turb miss letherby we are going to walk
back to the hotel through the park and i
will send some one to tow it into the
garage he turned to robinetta  how
long will it take you to walk he asked

   she laughed  its right across from the 
park isnt it about ten minutes then
really it isnt necessary for any one to
watch the car it has been out in the street
all evening

   but its late now said tony  ten
thirty anyhow you never know what
crooks may come by perhaps some me-
chanical genius could make that car run
after all far enough to steal it anyhow
laughing they nodded at the man who
followed them down to the car and made
off at a rapid pace along the street as
they turned the corner robin said quietly

 splendid now is there any chance of a
taxi

   we might have to wait said tony
 they dont run much here so far up the
avenue i thought i could get a friend of
mine to lend me his runabout it wont
take a minute he lives right here

    ill wait said robin briefly it seemed
the only thing to do time was of moment
robin could not accompany him to young
pedleys home at this hour of the night
while he asked for the loan qf a motor-car
it was not until tony had rung the bell
seven minutes after



that he remembered that the man he was
going to see must have received one of the
letters from the scarlet rider this is if
davids surmise had been true he dis-
missed the remembrance hurriedly wonder-
ing what had brought it to his mind ah
robin had spoken of the golden trust
building suddenly a light flashed on his
consciousness eleven oclock - golden
trust-this must have something to do with
the letter

   tom old man he said breathlessly
announcing himself to his astonished friend
the moment afterthe door opened  had a
breakdown important appointment and all
that can i borrow your runabout

   surest thing you know said tom ped-
ley  ill send james out to the garage
now have a cigar wont you

   nothing thanks tonycalled over his
shoulder following the amazed man-servant
along the hall to the back entrance and
nearly falling over him in his haste  see
you in the morning old top so long
robin climbed into her seat beside him
without a word for a moment tony al-
lowed himself the bliss of tooling the car
along the broad perfectly kept stretch of
avenue with this wonderful girl at his side
then he bent toward her speaking quietly

   robin you said something about trust-
ing me do you want to talk

   i must the girl sid in a low dis-
tressed voice  but first i want to ask
you a question i was all strung up i may
have imagined it but back there when i
was talking did you or did you not see
araminta look frightened

   yes he said quietly  when you
showed her that automatic and once be-
fore i think when you were talking about
that old convict i thought it was because
she-well-was annoyed at hearing a man
of that kind mentioned in her home ara-
minta always was a bit of a snob you know
but thinking it over im pretty sure it was
fright not disgust

  robin drew a long breath of relief
 that makes it certain thanks

   i know im butting in tony waited
a minute trying to focus his ideas  but
the fact is theres a chance of you making
a mistake i see of course that for some

reason you are suspecting araminta lether-
by of something-something that you think
is serious anyhow  still you only met her
to-night didnt you and ive known her a
long time araminta is all kinds of a fraud
in her affectation of refinement and delicacy
but shes really only a beautiful doll you
know she couldnt plot and scheme if she
tried honest i think youve gone off on
the wrong track there

   its like you to tell nlte just what you
would have done when we were playing
together out at shepherd all of us but
tony im making no mistake i met miss
letherby for the first time to-night actu-
ally yes but ive known about her for a
long time araminta letherby isnt one
bit stupid shes a very clever and danger-
ous person think how could she grow
stupid all at once wasnt she awfully
shrewd and clever when she was minta
crane that little ragged girl out west

   you cant remember her though you
were just a baby

   you all thought so it used to make me
wild but i was seven i hated and feared
minta i had reason oh wont you believe
at least that i have reason now for what i
am saying her voice broke in a little
pathetic appeal

   id believe you if you told me the moon
was made of cheese the young man an-
swered without intending to be ridiculous

  but quickly robinettas clear laugh rang
out  thank you she chuckled  excuse
me but really youre awfully funny

   im glad you find me so said tony
stiffly

  he looked straight ahead unable to hide
his annoyance he had put his heart into
his words and told himself grimly that it
was his own fault for using the first that
came to hand but in the midst of a serious
conversation with a young lady to whom
you had vowed fealty in your heart-to
have her laugh at your expression of it-
tony was not used to being laughed at by
women

  he set his eyes steadily on the hotel
lights now drawing very near when robin
glanced up at his face she saw that his
profile was cold and set timidly she
touched his arm


the argosy

   mr fane youre going to help me
 certainly said tony melting inward-
ly although his voice was crisply business-
like

   then please listen it is twenty min-
utes to eleven now i must go into the
hotel and up to my rooms araminta will
telephone i am sure to make certain that
i am there you go to the garage and
send a man back for my car then meet me
at the side entrance in ten minutes what-
ever happens i must be at the golden
trust at eleven that will leave time wont
it

   plenty we ought to make it in five

   then good-by mr fane and thank
you the girl held out her hand as she
stepped from the car almost before it drew
up at the hotel entrance and ran lightly
up the steps and into the lobby it did
not take her an instant to reach the ele-
vators and her smile at the starter made
him send her up rapidly in an empty car
she burst into her bedroom just as the
telephone rang

    answer it ellen she said to her maid
 ill talk to any one

  in another moment she took the receiver
the woman laid down

   yes miss letherby she said  just
got in im certainly sorry we have dis-
turbed you mr fane told the man not to
tell you anything about it no i couldnt
say he went to the hotel garage to send
a man back for the car no i dont care
its only a hired one anyway i had to
have something to drive guess ill buy
myself one to-morrow thank you so much
for calling good night

  robin replaced the receiver gently and
then faced her maid like a whirlwind
 ellen miss letherby will call again i
fancy in a few minutes im going out
but she mustnt know that pretend im in
the bathtub and after a minute ill come
to the telephone-in your person of course
-and explain that giggle and laugh into
the phone just as i do sometimes say
youre going to take a beauty steep and have
a massage be sure and make it plain that
you are undressed and going to stay right
here i think you can put that over cant
you

  the woman eyed her soberly  i think
so miss robin but i hope you arent
running into any danger miss

   no i dont think so elleri you dear
old thing it is to help-some one in des-
perate trouble anyway against that dan-
ger doesnt count but if-if i dont come
back in an hour or two at the most tell
mr david that the key to all is a trunk
with  s t r on it he can trace that
up all right and they wont really harm
me im sure of that

  like a laughing shadow she was gone
ellen heard the descending elevator carry-
ing her away and sighed then she hur-
ried to the window and raising the shade
looked out only the darkness of the park
was visible with here and there a gleaming
light of an automobile flew through the
gloom

  raising the window she listened to jhe
roar of the city frowningly who knew
what dangers adventurous dare-devil rob-
inetta cortland was about to face in this
strange place

  it was darker in the street near the ladies
entrance tony did not see robin until she
stood close beside him she settled down
in her seat nodding at him to proceed
out of the dinginess of sixth avenue they
sped into the splendor of fifth the traffic
was-small for the theaters had not yet dis-
gorged their crowds robin nestled back
in her seat with a sigh of content

   if it must be a city she said  then
let me see fifth avenue and replying to
tonys laugh  mr fane will you wait for
me round the corner from the golden
trust i must walk alone past the clock
there at exactly eleven im afraid-if
we were together-we might frighten off
that poor scarlet rider

   so it was-that tony said

  she nodded  yes why you and david
should have jumped to the conclusion that
it was eleven in the morning i cannot
think for a man harried by the police
and just out of prison think what a relief
it must be to do anything at night in the
dark but he never thought naturally how
he was courting disaster by sending out ail
those letters at once with a whole day in-
tervening oh -a sharp edge of anxiety
seven minutes after



was on her voice-how i hope we put
them off back there that araminta thinks
i am in the hotel

   you dont mean- said tony incredu-
lously

  robin shivered  but i do that and a
great deal more david doesnt dream he
hasnt an idea except her beauty i saw
that to-night and when i got to the house
i knew no more than you do except that i
had made up my mind to be at the golden
trust at eleven but before dinner some-
thing happened-i knew then that there
was a plot to prevent the poor fellow from
getting away i dont pretend to know
what it is-but anything that araminta
letherby has her hand in is always-inter-
esting she gave a faint smile

   david ought to be here said tony
uncomfortably  he will blame me if you
get into danger

    hes off on a still hunt himself some-
thing to do with that letter im sure we
may find him there before us you see
hes half in love with miss letherby and
he wouldnt have left her house early other-
wise but as for blaming you-that was
what you meant wasnt it-i am perfect-
ly responsible for myself and he certainly
knows it

    tony lets draw up over there close
to that hotel then if i find that any one
is watching us and im pretty sure they
will be watching the clock at the golden
trust i can help that poor fellow escape
into the hotel perhaps

   silently tony did as she asked he gave
one look at the slender beautiful little fig-
ure standing on the sidewalk and inwardly
he was consumed by fear

    miss cortland he begged  let me go
instead of you i have the right that poor
chap wrote to me i-

  robin smiled into his eyes with her
steady gray ones

   but you see she explained  he
knows me that makes a difference

   and swiftly she turned the corner in the
direction of the golden trust

  her destination was only a few doors
away but on the other side of the street
an automobile going at top speed dashed

over the crossing delaying her for a sec-
ond robin with her heart beating loudly
saw a tall figure with a queer loping gait
pass toward the golden trust on the other
side of the street and take up his stand
beneath the clock in the distance she
heard chimes somewhere a church clock
was striking the hour

  she walked quietly up to the man who
waited and spoke softly

   scarlett i am robinetta cortland from
shepherd we had your letter my brother
and i please come home with me

  something much like a sob answered her
the man whom she addressed caught her
hand and wrung it until she could have
screamed with the pain she looked up into
the long lean handsome face she remem-
bered laughing

   scarlett arent you ashamed of your-
self she said  hiding away from your old
friends like this why we were all so
anxious to help you and you had to sign
a name like that what did you mean
by using the name of scarlet rider instead
of scarlett t rider i should like to
know

  they were walking as she talked toward
the corner where tony waited out of sight
no one seemd to be watching but she was
taking no chances scarlett replied to her
eagerly

   why miss cortland i knewed it ud
take in nobody that knowed me not you
folkses nor mr fane while if the police
got a hand on it see he looked at her
secure of understanding

   but you were wrong scarlett i was the
only one who got  onto  it mr fane and
my brother knew nothing of whom it could
be perhaps thats because they havent
been back home for a long time either of
them ive kept in touch more both the
boys looked for you this morning you
know

   gee is that the truth now scarlett
stood still and looked back at the clock

 i never gave a thought to that didnt i
say eleven oclock at night in my letter
miss cortland i would no more a dared
to come out in the daytime not on a thing
like that thn nothin and believe me

i was some fiustrated when i sawed that i


the argosy

were late to-night gosh thinks i none
of the folkses will a waited i dont know
how it happened neither fur my watch said
one minute of eleven when i crossed the
street

   what do you mean said robin sharp-
ly  you were on time all right scarlett
she lifted her arm and beneath the light
of a street lamp bent to see the dial of
her wrist-watch  it is only two minutes
past the hour now and you promised to

wait until five minutes past you remember
that

   sure but that clock back there said
seven minutes after

  there are impressions that are more
vivid than any words they crowd on the
consciousness faster than explanations
robin needed no further words she tugged
at scarletts arm just a minute she
said  lets go back and make sure it
may be important

to be continued next week

reanne my jeanne they are try-
ing to kill you  etienne dubois held
out trembling hands to the girl-hands
that trembled as his whole body trem-
bled beneath its earth-stained shirt and
woolen trousers of a quarry workman
 better to marry any man rather than
jacques bolduc who is as hard as a steel
drill and as pitiless

  the lips of jeanne patry moved but he
could not hear the ghosts of words that
came looking into her widened eyes he
knew that a fear as great as his own pos-
sessed her he read it there in the gray
depths out of which had welled so many
smiles for him so many smiles that had
spoken love even before the words had been
said by her lips

  they stood together in the shelter of
some trees on the plateau that overlooks the
little village of visitation below them the
blue and silver st lawrence went out to sea
and above in the distance the misty lau-

rentians were banked against the sky a
few stolen dangerous moments at the end
of his days work was all that dubois had of
jeanne now that her family looked coldly
upon him and this meeting had brought the
news that a marriage was planned between
her and the quarry boss jacques bolduc

  she took the shaking hands held out to
her swayed toward him a moment and then
held herself erect something of determina-
tion struggled with the fear that had nearly
mastered her

   i will do all that i have strength to
do she said  but they bear me down-
they are all against me he has money he
will own a quarry they say and-

  mon dieu interrupted etienne
 they count love nothing because i am
a workman they commit this sacrilege
jeanne broke away from the grasp of his
tight fingers and covered her face he tried
to take her in his arms but she held him off
gently with a palm against his breast
stronger than iron



   i must not my etienne if i am
forced to this marriage i must go to it as i
would go to you but pray and i will
pray

    you will not be  he cried with a sud-
den stiffness in his slender but well muscled
body  ill take you away-well elope
a swift brightness swept into her face as
she lifted it to be half obliterated imme-
diately by doubt after all she was hardly
yet a woman thought dubois ctfuld he
raise her to his fierce rebellion to his
defiance of the customs of their people and
the opinion of the parish

    would it be right etienne

    more right than for you to marry with-
out love 

    eh bien her eyes searched the deli-
cate clouds of the horizon as though for
wisdom i will ask le bon dieu about
that and we will talk about it to-morrow
she touched his hand with a movement
light as air and walked swiftly away toward
the road that went twisting down to the vil-
lage he watched until her black head dis-
appeared over the edge of the cliff

   but there was no to-morrow for etienne
dubois-no to-morrow for his hope or his
happiness the next evening at sunset
jeanne was not there nor any evening after
that for a week she was not seen in the
streets of the village and none of the frantic
although discreet efforts that he made to
learn something of her availed only an
indefinable gleam in the eyes of jacques
bolduc gave any message to dubois-and
that he could not read

   mile jeanne patry was seen again by the
people of visitation at the end of the week
when she rode to the church to be married
to bolduc the hard unalterable fact that
she came out of that sacred place bound
to jacques bolduc until death struck
etienne as simply and as horribly as though
one of the rocks that he handled every day
had risen up of its own volition and crushed
him he noted the absence of the boss at
the quarry heard rumors and was in time
to see her bent head as she stepped into a
carriage-mme bolduc

   without coat or hat or so much as a piece
of cold pork in his pocket dubois set out for
the shelter of the mountains driven by an

instinct that made him hide the utter misery
of his grief even from his own family he
went on that night until he fell-to get up
again and go on when a sudden madness of
rage against fate gave him the strength
through the night and the day following he
walked and fell prayed and cursed and
shook his fists at the world

   it was late the third day when he entered
his own house but when he did go back
his head was held erect his gaze met the
questioning glances of his people without
faltering and the only weakness that was in
him was that of the body he had put the
thought of jeanne far away he kept it
within his mental vision still but it was like
a gleaming white shrine seen across inter-
minable fields

  so he moved through life for weeks
grave and self-possessed and immeasurably
older than the boy who had gone into the
mountains each day he met a flash of tri-
umph in the face of jacques bolduc and
each day he looked calmly on that broad
square-jawed countenance with indifference

  he had gone into the mountains hating
bolduc-now he pitied him the foreman
was now good natured-enough but he drove
-drove the men to a greater production of
the quarried stone of visitation and thus
drove on toward the success which he now
boasted would be his he meant to be-
come an owner within a year

  not until well toward the end of that
summer did etienne again meet jeanne face
to face it happened without warning when
he turned a corner on his way home from
work he was very tired and this was the
great test of his power over himself the test
that he had been dreading and trying to
prepare for

  her eyes flashed up from the boards of
the narrow sidewalk and met his squarely
for a second they looked at each other
within an arms length and read what had
been written in eye and face then they
went on without speaking and dubois
found himself walking very straight now
indeed w he sure that he was master of
himself

  he was certain of this notwithstanding
what he had seen in the eyes of jeanne bol-
duc deeper than any pain or surprise that


the argosy

she might have felt at the sight of him was
the impress of horror-such a look as one
might wear after having touched something
unclean

  etienne dubois knew what that look of
horror meant he had read the too-full lips
and the narrow eyes of buldoc when first
they met he knew and as his imagina-
tion took hold of his knowledge and turned
it over and showed him the infinite misery
of the thing he knew his soul again wrent
down into the deep places

  this time he was obsessed with the de-
sire to kill he pictured his fingers sinking
into the throat of the foreman-pictured his
boots beating against the hated face

  but even as those days and nights in the
mountains had brought him back to his
normal life-brought him back and given
him strength to meet jeanne face to face
once more-so now the thing that had been
done to him asserted itself when dawn
came haggard and gray as the look with
which he met it he was able to put the
tragedy outside of himself he could be
calm he could swing the hammer and
hold a drill and gaze into the eyes of bolduc
without breaking -

  it was something almost like peace that
filled him with self-confidence as he went to
work that day something akin to peace and
victory that had given him a new semblance
to the eye of the beholder-as though a
kindly hand had wiped away from his face
the ravages of his passions and remolded it
with a gentle touch it was like this that
he met bolduc just after the whistle blew

  triumph had filtered away from the fore-
man etienne did not know whether this
had happened overnight or whether he him-
self had just that day been given eyes to
see however that might be he was as sure
of the lack of triumph as he was of the
hatred that seemed to come like a hot sick-
ening wave from bolduc

  before that day was ended the intuition
of dubois was proven sound he had
come out from behind an angle of rock after
a blast when hobnails grated beside him and
he turned to find jacques bolduc so close to
him that their arms almost touched

  im going to give her a grave to think
about instead of a man

  the words were spoken in a tone so low
that they barely carried to the ear of du-
bois but in them was all the ferocity of
which the tremendous will of the boss was
capable etienne halted and looked into
his enemys eyes almost with indifference
and yet with readiness to protect himself
he looked steadily until bolduc decided to
go on

  now dubois knew definitely that he
had to guard his life every hoifr of every
day for it was inevitable that sooner or
later some accident of the work they did
would give the boss a chance to bring about
his death with the appearance of innocence
he had speculated as to whetherbolduc
might develop such a hatred for him and he
was glad of the warning

  but the cause how did jacques know
she was thinking of him or was it imagi-
nation he had no way of telling

  nor were they to be answered for a long
time to dubois after the threat weeks
and months passed uneventfully for him and
spring came again to visitation the vil-
lage with the intimacy of a french-cana-
dian hamlet had settled to the conviction
that jeanne bolduc was unhappy that her
husband was getting richer every day and
that etienne dubois was a fine fellow

  dubois went to work again in the quarry
as soon as the melting of the snow permitted
it to open but he had begun to wonder
whether it would not be well to change his
occupation the malignity of the now all-
powerful bolduc cut him off from hope of
rising above the grade of workmen and the
constant strain of guarding himself had be-
gun to tell but before the slow moving
life of the country would permit him to put
this thought into action the consummation
of bolducs hatred came

  seven charges had been fired almost to-
gether the whole great pit of the quarry
which was shaped as though a giants por-
ride spoon had scraped a hole in the earths
surface was filled with smoke and the clat-
ter of still bounding fragments as the men
came out from their hiding places as
usual the foreman was in the lead of the
scattered groups and this time it happened
that etienne was within a few feet of him

  the force of the explosion had ripped off
stronger than iron



a layer from half the face of the cliff into
which they were boring and it had heaped
up the debris in a wilderness of strange
shapes one mass of broken rock rose up
like a slovenly built wall tiny slivers and
pieces as big as a mans trunk had gone into
the making and it towered unsteadily fully
twenty feet high even as the smoke began
to clear it wavered and settled a little with
a hint of complete collapse instinctively
the men halted waiting for the crash

  the crash did not come jacques bolduc
turned his head slowly and his eyes fell
upon etienne-they went to the pile of
jagged rocks again and back to the man he
hated suddenly he leaped to where a
couple of crowbars leaned against a neigh-
boring block of stone and seized one in each
hand

    here dubois he cried holding out a
bar  help me tip that pile over you
others stand clear 

  mechanically etienne took the bar and
went forward with the boss but even as he
did so he realized that he had read purpose
in the glance of bolduc should he turn
back not that-the others would call him
a coward his fingers took a tighter hold
upon the iron he would see it through-
jacques could not harm him now that he
was forewarned

   loosen that big chunk in the middle-
at the bottom ordered bolduc  thats
the keystone ill work at the ends so that
itll all go together 

  dubois scrambled to the big stone to
which the foreman had pointed and labored
to get the point of his bar under one comer
of it he heard shouts of warning from the
other men and he knew that they realized
his apparent danger but-he knew also that
the rock upon which he was spending his
strength uselessly would have little or noth-
ing to do with the fall of the mass above it
he had not worked with stone all his life
without profiting in knowledge of its ways
and he knew as well as bolduc knew that
this particular fantastic pile would collapse
under leverage from the rear the weight
leaned forward and the place in which
etienne dubois stood would be a place of
death

  nevertheless dubois remained where he

was for the moment grunting and making a
great pretense of labor he heard the clink
of bolducs bar at one end of the pile then
the sound ceased and at length from the op-
posite side and above his head came a
shout  are you ready dubois whats
the matter with you

    another minute he replied to the in-
visible voice  one minute more and ill
be ready to get out of the way

  with the words he dropped his bar and
leaped for his life going cat-footed from
rock to rock in spite of thick shoes and a
strong desire to laugh he reasoned thus
bolduc was ready to spring his trap and
had wanted to make sure that he was still
in front of the pile an ominous grating
and the sound of falling fragments con-
firmed his belief-he knew as certainly as
though he had looked behind that the rocks
were teethering forward

   only at the corner where bolduc had first
pretended to work did etienne stop there
he swung around breathless just as a cry
that was half shout half groan came from
the watchers he saw tons of rock in a slow
movement that gained velocity each frac-
tion of a second-saw that jacques bolduc
had fallen and was being carried forward
with one leg twisted down into the grinding
wave of stone which would break in a mo-
ment with a shower of dust and splinters

   etienne gathered himself hesitated and
sprang straight up the side of the totering
prison of bolduc he had no hope either
for himself or the foreman until he had
actually laid hold upon the shirt of the
latter-and then just as he began to think
that the long delayed crash would delay a
little longer it came he flung himself
backward as they fell partially freeing
jacques and saw the world become a black-
ness shot with streaming fire

  etienne dubois awoke in his own bed
with the face of an amateur nurse whom he
knew very well bending over him she
called him  un brave and told him to go
to sleep which he promptly refused to do
without some idea of what had happened
thus he learned that he himself was sound
except for some injuries about the face as to
which the nurse would not be explicit

  the foreman he lay at home very


the argosy

badly injured and no one could say what
might happen but that in any event m
dubois was the hero of the village at which
information etienne felt so much surprise
that he forgot to ask any more questions

  but while dubois was lying in compara-
tive comfort and with a feeling of rest that
he had not known for long jacques bolduc
dwelt in a deep dark region of agony where
his first thought was bitterness and his first
hope that he had at least drawn dubois to
a fate equaling his own for he himself as
he knew with his return to consciousness
was a stricken man it did not do any good
for his wife and the others to lie about it

  so they told him at last after days dur-
ing which he suffered countless bandagings
and proddings at the hands of doctor and
nurses one of -his legs was too twisted
and broken by the rocks ever to be of any
use again he could walk on crutches of
course after his other injuries had healed
and he ought to thank god and etienne du-
bois that he was alive if it had not been
for that backward pull at the hands of du-
bois he would have been buried literally
under at least a tons weight

  this was the bitterest of the medicine
that fate had placed upon his tongue-that
he should owe his life to his enemy for
some latent almost stifled element of mag-
nanimity stirred in him and told him that
his hand was forever restrained - never
again could it be lifted against dubois he
hated this restraint this intangible some-
thing that balked his will hated it all the
more because he knew that it was something
that the strength of his will could not over-
tome

   the root of the matter lay in the fact that
his god had failed him to the driving force
of will power he had given all homage all
worship and in return for the soul he had
placed upon that gods altar he had been
given only half favors he had driven his
way to affluence and he had won the body
and control of jeanne-enough he had
thought at one time to make him forever
satisfied but greater things than these
had dripped like water through his thick-
fingered clutch

  that long-past threat against dubois had
been made after jeanne had cried  eti-

enne in her sleep-to awaken trembling
with uncontrolled sobs then bolduc knew
that this woman in his possession was no
more his than the wind that drove against
his face what the eye could see was his
to have and to hold to beat and caress but
the woman herself belonged to etienne du-
bois and no pounding of bolducs will to
own her love could break that other bond

  after that for the first time he caught
the look of horror which her yes un-
guarded held for him more-one day he
saw her gazing after the form of etienne
and read what was written in her face in
that moment was born an insane desire to
kill dubois and to bind the woman he
had tried to kill and the effort had struck
him down in such a manner that what good
still struggled for life within him forbade
another trial as to binding what of jeanne
was visible forever to him he was deter-
mined in purpose but uncertain as to means

  even good -french-canadian women had
been known to err-to run away from their
husbands he thought of this constantly
permitting himself to degrade her in his
thoughts and in the very act of giving him-
self a thousandfold more mental agony he
could not kill etienne-he could not watch
his wife all the time oftentimes between
sleeping and waking strange ideas came to
him at first to be put away and then grad-
ually to be entertained thus he lay and
brooded and held back his recovery so that
it was the end of summer before he was
able to walk down to the quarry awkwardly
enough on his new crutches but driven by
determination to look upon dubois

  he found etienne and stood face to face
with him grating out a few hard words of
thanks hard by reason of the smile that
was on the lips of dubois and harder still
because of the long red hideous scar that
ran blotched and tinged with purple from
brow to neck of the man who had saved
him it spread over nearly all of the cheek
yet dubois could smile without malice or
contempt or any other emotion

  bolduc hated him more than ever but he
knew that the man who held his wifes heart
was safe-the last doubt of this passed from
his mind even if his hand lifted to strike
the sight of that scar would stay it more-
stronger than iron



over there was a quality in this steel-
hard slender workman that awed him-
made him feel that etienne was watching
over jeanne and protecting her

  that feeling of the watchfulness of du-
bois followed jacques bolduc and annoyed
himlike a thousand devils yet he managed
to attend to his affairs and they prospered
as always as the days went on however
less and less of his mind was given to the
quarry and to business and more went to
turning over and over the problem of
jeanne it was in essence this how to
conquer her he thought of it constantly
and his face grew black and set

  in her unguarded moments jeannes eyes
now showed fear mingled with horror and
this began to give bolduc a curious kind of
satisfaction once or twice he found him-
self chuckling over it hed teach her where
the heart of a wife belonged he did not
know just how at the time but hed be able
to beat this womans game sooner or later

  one day when he was in the tool-house
at the quarry the idea came to him in
looking half indifferently to the condi-
tion of the drills his hand came in contact
with a light bar of iron such as is used
about a forge his fingers closed around
it two or three feet long and reasonably
stout-it would bend a little under sufficient
pressure but it would not break not to
the touch of unaided human strength into
the twisted channels of his mind came an
analogy between the metal and his will he
was iron they could not break him

  he set a hand to each end of the bar and
bent it half double behold it was not
broken and the picture of what he would
do to hold his wife forever came to him as
clearly in all its details as any conception
he had ever formed he laughed so that
the sound filled the little building-and
went out with the bar swinging in his grasp

  after that bolduc was neither at his
house nor at the quarry through the after-
noons of an unbroken week he had been
so erratic in his movements that no one ex-
cept his wife noticed that he disappeared
from the village she saw that he went off
along the main highway making good prog-
ress now that the autumn frosts had hard-
ened the ground and believed that he was

walking for exercise to clear his mind of the
miasmas which she had seen gathering there
as the week passed his looks were still dark
and he still kept his habit of laughing
silently tohimself but she thought that the
relaxation had done him good and some of
her fear went away

   she began to believe that he was going to
recover also she had more than once seen
etienne duboise following after jacques
keeping himself well out of sight and she
had the belief that etienne was watching to
see that no harm came to her

   in this double feeling of security she slept
with the depth of exhaustion on the night
that ended the week of her husbands ap-
parent improvement-so soundly that when
she began to awake with a vague fear in her
heart and a sense of physical distress it took
what seemed an age to come back to con-
sciousness at last her eyes opened and
her vision groped in the dimly-lighted bed-
room

   she saw jacques standing fully dressed
beside the bed he leaned upon his crutches
balancing himself with his thick arms hang-
ing loose and his fingers drawing in and out
he laughed she had heard such a laugh
once when she visited the great asylum for
the insane at mastai she tried to spring
up and found that bonds held her wrists
and ankles she tried to scream but there
was something bound into her mouth that
held her tongue down and choked her ut-
terance

  bolduc bent and flung her over his
shoulder as he would have carried a sack of
flour and passed a long leather strap under
his arm and over her body so that she would
not fall while his hands were attending to
the crutches then he stumped out of the
room and the house and started purpose-
fully through the village it was near dawn
-she knew that by the feeling and the hint
in the sky-but visitation had not yet
awakened and no help would come forth to
her from those dark and silent houses
where was etienne whose watchfulness she
had believed in surely he would come-
it must be that god would send him she
closed her eyes and prayed and mercifully
she went from prayer into temporary ob-
livion


the argosy

  this time she returned to physical suffer-
ing-and to the terror of what seemed at
first an impossible nightmare but she
knew that it was real because of the chill
that struck through her and because of a
terrible strain that racked her body with a
pain greater than any she had felt before

  the twisted grinning face of jacques
bolduc was the central point of the night-
mare he stood swaying on his crutches as
a caged animal sometimes stands and sways
--with the same loose-muscled power to
strike light from half a dozen candles re-
vealed also oozing rock walls to which clung
wet grass and clots of slime walls all
around except for the hint of a gray open-
ing behind jacques and a roof of rock
dark pools treacherous looking as to depth
dotted the floor

  she realized that she was neither standing
nor sitting nor lying down and that the
almost unendurable pull came from her right
arm she twisted her body and looked up
her wrist was clasped by a tight iron ring
that ran through the bolt set into the un-
even sloping wall against which she lay
she saw where a dark stream had run down
her naked arm from the ring and dried
with a whimper of cold and pain she set her
naked feet more firmly on the slippery floor
and nearly but not quite succeeded in
standing the ring and bolt had been cun-
ningly placed

  ive got you now the laughter of
the maniac rang back and forth in the cav-
ern he came nearer chuckling with his
mad eyes gloating close to hers  ive got
you now where you cant look at etienne
dubois youre down in a cave at the edge
of the river-and nobody in the world but
me knows where it is ive got you now
where you cant run off youll stay here
forever and ever with the tide coming in up
to your feet and out again ive got you
where you cant get away

  his laughter rose to a screech he
rocked with it as a tree bends to strong
wind his crutches slipped away unnoticed
and he stood perilously balanced on his
sound leg with his glaring eyes upon her
and his mouth emitting those sounds of
hideous mirth

  ive got you now he shrieked and

as the words left his lips he swayed toward
her-swayed until his body lost its equili-
brium and his foot slipped from its place on
the firm rock down into one of those still
dark pools that were scattered over the bot-
tom of the cavern

  he pitched forward with arms outfhmg
and his head struck on the edge of the pool
as he disappeared from the sight of jeanne
the black water heaved and settled again
the ripples gradually died away  the pool
became as still as it had been and there was
no sound in the cave but the occasional tiny
splash of a drop from the seeping walls
jacques bolduc had left the world his will
had not been able to shape

  the tide came in creeping and stopped
its welcome menace at her feet the can-
dles that jacques had set to light her suf-
ferings had burned to stumps toward him
now she had no feeling but forgiveness--
she had little feeling of any kind save that
and her thirst for etienne

  through the stillness a cry reverberated
jeanne heard her name in a voice she knew
as the one that spoke to her soul-the voice
of etienne she saw the yellow brightness
of a lantern flinging back her shadows and
summoned her life forces in a great effort to
speak

   the pools etienne she whispered as
he bent over her  jacques died in one of
them-take care-

  she glimpsed an iron bar above her head
and saw his face half hidden by straining
arms iron grated on stone a fearful pam
seared her wrist and then she sank down
upon the dank floor free etienne lifted
her with the clinking ring and bolt still on
her wrist and drew a blanket close over her
shoulders

   god forgive me  he panted  i went
to sleep as i watched your house last night
-for a week i-ve known what he was domg
down here and every night ive stood guard
to stop him and he did it in the vary
hour when my strength failed me 

   your strength fail she murmured as
he bore her out into the sunlit morning
 do you call it failure after a week without
sleep my etienne the strength of your
soul is stronger than iron

small man with watery blue eyes and a
ragged beard he looked about him for
help but the crowd although they all suf-
fered from the exactions of the viceroy
were not unwilling to see some one else
suffer najob azoura put his rugs in a
neat pile and turned them one at a time as
a man might turn the leaves of a book

    rubbish  exclaimed ali hassan as the
rugs fell one by one  made of filth and
colored with mud show me thy best

   they are my best pleaded najob
azoura  my wares are for poor men
the mounted man reached out and
touched the merchant with his staff

    not so fast he said  there was one
thou didst not show me

  the merchant spread out his hands and
said  that one i have not showed thee
because it is sold

 show it to me said the implacable ali
najob azoura shrugged his stooped
shoulders took a bit of sacking from his
rugs turned them up and showed the one
on the very bottom

    spread it out to the full said ms tor-
mentor

   ah but the sun whined his victim
 the sun will fade it such are for indoors
and thou knowest wise one that one hairs-
breadth change in the color will ruin all
the staff cut the air and fell upon the
dusty shoulders of the merchant

   do as i say or there will be no more
sunlight for thee 

  najob azoura wept a few tears spread
the rug out to the full and squatted on his
heels beside it

   where didst thou get this rug said
ali hassan and why has no one robbed
thee of it

   najob azoura lifted his head to say  it
is the true bokhara the blue is the light
afghanistan blue there are full four hun-
dred knots to the inch

  ali hassan looked long upon the shim-
mering fabric before him

    and it is sold

   aye said najob

   then shalt thou unsell it find the
buyer and give him back his price

  the merchant looked piteously about
among the crowd

   he is not here excellency he said
the crowd raised a hoot of laughter at
the way in which the merchant had been
caught

   nor is he anywhere old fool  said
ali  five minutes will i give thee to find
him for none can say that i am not just
then if i find that thou hast lied to me
will i have thy feet whipped

  najob azoura raised his voice in a long
wail

   allah he crifed  thou hast forgot-
ten me

  a tall figure stepped from the crowd and
bowed low to ali hassan

   i am the buyer he said  i did but
now chaffer with this man for his rug and
i paid him a part of the purchase price

   only a tenth cried the rug merchant
springing tm his feet  it was but a
tenth and i shall give him but what he
gave me

   beware young man said ali  how
thou dealest with me i am not a coast
dweller who lives by laws and courts and
decrees no man hath lied to me with
impunity

   nor do i lie now said the young man
looking fearlessly at ali  what i have
said is truth

   it maketh little difference to me said
the viceroy shrugging his shoulders  thou
hast saved him from a beating pay him
najob azoura

  the rug merchant opened his pouch and
counted out two gold pieces

   two pounds in english gold he said
 one-twentieth of the purchase price
one-tenth dog cried ali hassan
 why wilt thou lie therefore thy rug
is worth but twenty pounds in english gold
i will give thee five for it and it is only
the favor of allah that giveth thee that
najob azoura wailed again

   forty pounds in good english gold it
cost me at constantinople he wept
 thou wilt ruin me

   ruin thee thou gold-stuffed coast
dweller scoffed his opponent it is a
favor to take some of thy wealth before the
bedouin do come to the coffee-house of
mustufa and thou shalt have thy gold
there batata take the rug
alis revenge-and allahs



  one of ali hassans retinue rolled the
rug up and put it on his shoulder najob
azoura made no sound fate was against
him he wrapped his cloak about his head
and sat down on his heels the other mer-
chants chaffed him he lighted his pipe and
hid himself in a cloud of smoke

  ali hassan touched his donkey with his
stick and the beast trotted gingerly among
the piles of merchandise and into a narrow
street the black ran ahead of him and
chanted way for ali hassan the
cobbler at the sound picked up his leather
and moved closer to the wall the letter
writer hid his fair parchment under his
robes even the dogs at the door-steps
lowered their heads and stood quiet as the
little procession trotted past

  the street opened suddenly into a square
bounded on the one side by a minaretted
mosque on the others by shops and the
colonnaded front of a caravansary the
donkey tapped smoothly across the square
and stopped before the blue front of a
coffee-house ali hassan slid out of his
saddle and walked in

  welcome ali hassan cried the pro-
prietor preceding him to the corner near
the fountain  welcome to my poor shop
there is a youth here to see thee

  he wiped a table dry arranged the
cushions in the corner and clapped his
hands

   coffee he shouted  coffee arfd a
pipe for ali hassan

  a servant brought the coffee mill the
charcoal-lamp the dish of green berries
he roasted the berries until they crackled
ground them in the stone mill and boiled
the grains in the long-snouted pot he
poured the thick liquid into a cup thin as
egg shell and stood waiting until the great
man should have approved his work

  ali sipped grunted and the servant
glided back to his corner mustufa the
proprietor filled the pipe with fine persian
tobacco and held a coal to it until it was
well alight ali sighed a deep breath and
lay back among the cushions

   you spoke oj a youth my mustufa
he said  who wished to see me

   aye my ali replied mustufa  he is
just come on a long journey from across

    	argosy

the desert for he sat here watching the jet
of water as though it flowed from heaven
shall i bring him to thee

  ali waved his hand and mustufa said
 i hassan will speak with thee 
striker

  the young man arose the same who had
saved najob azoura in the bazaar and
stood before the sultans viceroy he was
a tall young man lithe almost to thinness
and his face showed th dean outline of
thorough blood he wore a burnoose or
desert cloak and the white turban ended
in a flowing tail to keep the sun from his
neck he put his hands to his forehead
and bent his head in greeting

   what wouldst thou with me said ali
looking at him from under heavy lids  i
thought i had seen the last of thee this
morning

   rumor hath made thee known over
all arabia said the young man  fame
runneth before a man like a trumpet note
it is said of thee that thou hast a pearl of
price in thy possession called ayeshas mir-
ror and that by looking into this pearl one
can find lost treasure it is said that this
pearl hath never failed and on it thou hast
reared thy great fortune on that he
added seeing the shade of displeasure in
the great mans face and thy great
talents

   and thou hast come to me to find a
lost treasure

   aye ali hassan

  what is thy name

   kahleel son of kahleel

   thou art a coast dweller said ali
hassan  thou canst not fool me young
man

   i have no wish to fool thee great one
said kahleel  it is of the pearl that i
wish to speak

   one born and bred in the oasis of nejed
as i have been said ali hassan  can tell
the speech of the men of the coast and
thou hast not been long from the desert i
car tell by the way in which thine eyes
follow the water trickling there

   thou art right heaven hath given
thee wit with fortune

   be plain with me youth said ali
putting a fresh coal to his pipe  and i will


the argosy

be kind to thee what is it that thou hast
lost be sure the pearl will find it

   is that true said the youth eagerly
 as true as that allah ruleth in heaven
and his prophet on earth the parl which
i have mohammed gave to ayesha when
he took her to wife at his death her holy
tears fell upon it since then it hath had
the marvelous power of which thou speak-
est and so it is called ayeshas mirror
no less than a week ago the chief of the
beni lam came to me to find a herd of
camels which had strayed

   he looked in my pearl and saw the
pillar of basalt by which they were then
grazing he went and found them he
would not have paid me saying that that
pillar was in his mind when he looked but
no man hath ever kept from me my just
reward so i took a half of his herd
 the treasure that i seek is not of the
animal kind said kahleel

   money then

   not money

   jewels

   nor jewels

 mayhap a rug said ali smiling
kahleel shook his head and ali said
 what in the devils name can it be then
there be no other treasures than those
 must i tell thee

   yes else the charm will not work

   what is the best treasure that a man
may have said kahleel

   i know not said ali good-humoredly
 leaving out camels money and jewels
 and what of a womans heart

  hot said ali rasing his heavy eye-
brows almost to his cap  tee caravan
marcheth in that quarter young man
let me advise thee thou art a fool to set
a womans heart above real treasure what
woman is there who is not bought and sold
even as a camel wouldst thou have the
creature for a slave well enough but thy
face sayeth you would wed her and a wife
is worse than a tooth-ache

   i would have her to wife said kahl-
eel  and know ali hassan great as thou
art i will not stand here talking with thee
if i may see the gem i will look and de-
part if not farewell and may allah pros-
per thee

   nay said ali still in good humor
 every merchant doth business in his own
way i am twice thine age o kahleel i
could have had any woman to wife yet i
remain a bachelor do thou likewise and
be happy

   but what of the wife said kahleel
earnestly  who reigneth gently in her
house what of her that hath the voice of
the nightingale the grace of a deer and the
eyes of a dove she bringeth aman strong
sons ali hassan thou dost ill to speak so
of love for had not ayesha loved the
prophet and she him thy pearl had been
but a pearl and naught else

   knowest thou one who would be all
this said ali shooting a quick glance at
his visitor

   that  ali is the treasure i seek

   thy wife left thee then

   i said not the woman was my wife
said the youth patiently  i would have
her so

   nor is she the wife of another

   no

   a maid then mused the sultans
friend sitting up among his cushions  and
she is here in nejed

   else i had not come to see thee ali
hassan are there wits within that head
 every man worketh in his own way
said ali  thou shalt look in my pearl
but eloquence my youth hath cost thee
dear forty pounds in english gold shalt
thou pay for thy look

  kahleel put his hands to his forehead
bent his head and said  then we part
ali hassan

   nay said the owner of the pearl
 then this is not such a treasure after all
thou couldst buy a blond georgian for
twenty pounds english

   there are treasures which are above
price said kahleel  i will pay what a
poor student in the mosque at medina can
pay-ten pounds in gold but let me look
in the peail quickly

   twenty said the older man  and
thou shalt look

   the devil fly away with thee ejacu-
lated kahleel  thou wilt drive me mad
many a man hath died for being as ugly
as thou art
alis revenge-and allahs



   and many a man said ali hassan
 hath died for being as quick with his
tongue as thou art hark ye ali hassan
ruleth in the fair oasis of nejed and thou
hadst best keep a cool tongue between thy
teeth a poet could not have spoken more
eloquence of love than thou and there was
something in thy talk of medina the holy
therefore shalt thou see at thy price but
not now for here cometh the old man with
his rugs

chapter ii

his hearts desire

majob azoura limped across the dusty
square bearing on his own shoulders his
bale of rugs he came to the door of the
coffee-house peered in then salaamed al-
most to the ground the viceroy of the
sultan shook with silent laughter

   old man he said as i see thee
standing there i can think of nothing but
an old jerboa rat-the kind that lurk in the
holes at the desert edge come in and my
mustufa will give thee coffee and a pipe
 i have no heart for a pipe groaned
the merchant  but coffee might lift these
drooping spirits of mine i will thank
thee for that

  he shuffled in threw down his rugs and
sat upon them

   coffee of the best cried ali hassan
 with a touch of cinnamon in it

  the old man drank silently while ali
looked at him with delight najob azoura
set down his cup spread out his hands and
said even the strongest must bow to
fate and i am but a poor man

   thou wilt know better next time said
his tormentor  no merchant doth busi-
ness here without the protection of ali
hassan

   thou wilt pay me said the old man
 the five pounds in gold

   aye said ali  thou shalt have it
old miser he opened his pouch and
counted out five gold pieces najob azoura
watched them fall upon the table one by
one weighed each one upon his finger tips
and put them in his own greasy pouch he
arose and salaamed deeply to the great man

   and now he said  i have thy leave
to depart

   aye said ali  with a bit of advice
from me take thy mind from thy money
bags najob azoura and the next time thou
art here remember the sultans viceroy
the merchant wagged his head sorrow-
fully without a word took his rugs upon
his back and shuffled out and across the
square

   now then my kahlael he continued
 it is thy turn but pay me first half the
money and if thou seest thy wish pay me
the other half

  kahleel counted out five gold pieces into
the palm of ali the latter clapped his
hands and a slave glided in

   watch at the door said the viceroy
 and send some of thy fellows to watch at
the back

  when the slave had gone he opened his
pouch and took out a small leather case

   there was never the woman he said
 who could match this pearl in beauty
he opened the case and showed a large
somewhat irregular pearl lying in a bed of
black velvet it was pear-shaped slightly
flattened and kahleel caught his breath at
the rush of color that played over its mir-
rorlike surface at the slightest movement
of ali hassans hand most pearls are a
bit dull as though a gem originally violet
in color were overlaid with a powdering of
some fine white substance but alis pearl
had all the smoothness polish and fiery
play of color that goes with the opal

   it is a marvel said kahleel after he
had looked at the pearl for a moment  and
a holy thing since it hath been washed by
the tears of ayesha yet i know a greater
treasure

   take it thou poet said ali  in the
palm of thy hand and hold it to the morn-
ing light think of thy treasure and thou
shalt see where it lieth

  kahleel took the pearl in his hand and
held it so that a beam of light struck full
upon it he saw a tiny but faithful pic-
ture of the square-the mosque across the
way the open front of the caravansary a
towered house upon a small hill wave
after wave of color rolled across the mirror-
like surface of the gem and so faithful was


the argosy

the reproduction that he saw even the tiny
picture of the dog who dozed in the sunny
square

    ayesha  said the young man  as
thou livest in bliss show me where my
treasure lieth

  he looked long at the pearl and said
 o mohammed if ever thou hadst com-
passion on young lovers show me the way
to my treasure

  for a long moment he looked then took
a deep breath and gave the gem back to its
owner

   thou hast had thy wish said ali
  thou hast seen where thy treasure is

   aye said kahleel  i have seen he
counted out the other five gold pieces

   and was it as thou didst say eyes of
the gazelle grace of the nightingale and
the rest of it

   yes

   and is the treasure near to thee now
 there was nothing in the contract to
make me tell thee that said kahleel

   as thou wilt said ali pocketing the
pearl and the gold pieces  but be sure
that i can see in the pearl as well as thou
 so be it said kahleel

   i would not have thee go so soon said
ali  i could listen to thy talk of love for
all the morning thou hast fired my heart
with all this poetry i too would have a
wife such as thou hast described

   allah will bring thee that as he hath
brought all other things said kahleel he
put his hands to his forehead bowed and
departed

  ali hassan shifted in his seat to watch
the young man cross the square the youth
went straight to the caravansary

   where any fool would have gone to find
a traveller said the owner of the pearl
 ali hassan it is the foolishness of men as
much as thine own with that maketh thee
what thou art

  but the young man went straight through
the caravansary without stopping the
keeper of it ran out to him and cried  a
camel sir i have here a young camel of
the true oman breed as fleet as any horse
he pointed to a flea-bitten beast so old
that her hump had almost disappeared
kahleel shook his head and passed

through the ankle-deep dust of the square
and out into the lane over the tops of
the mud walls that lined it leaned date
fronds and he could hear the plash and
gurgle of water within the walled gardens
ahead of him lay a slight rise of ground-
on top of it stood the towered house which
he had seen in the pearl a heavy gate
iron-clad and barred stood in a deep recess
in the wall and over it jutted the carved
work of the second story a beggar sat in
the shade by the gate and held out a
skinny hand to kahleel

  alms young man alms for the love
of allah

  kahleel paused before him

   how long hast thou been here o fa-
vored of god he asked

   longer than thou hast lived youth
said the beggar  and naught but pain for
me all that time

   knowest thou said kahleel balanc-
ing a coin on the tip of his finger  knowest
thou if any woman hath entered this house
within the last week

   one came two days ago said the beg-
gar  in a train of four camels a man
rode one-two carried baggage-there was
a litter on the fourth and i heard a woman
weeping it was a gray oman camel and i
have not seen the like of it for grace there
were four bales of rugs in the baggage and
such pots and pans as a man might take on
a long journey

   what manner of a man was it

   an old man small with eyes like a
kittens

   knowest thou his name

   najob azoura 

  kahleel struck his palms together

   how came she to be with him

  i am not allah said the beggar  to
see into all things

   i am content said kahleel  here
is thy fee he dropped the coin into the
beggars lap and let a second follow it

   remember he said  thou hast never
seen me nor dost thou see what i do now
he looked up and down the lane save
for himself and the beggar it was empty
a young date palm grew by a rill of water
that trickled through the lane he climbed
it and rocked it until the sap oozed from
alps revenge-and allahs



the trunk as it leaned toward the wall
opposite to the house he jumped quickly
and landed light as a cat on the wall he
ran softly along it until he was opposite the
carved window of the chamber over the
gate and there dropped flat under the pro-
tection of a branch of foliage

  across from him spread the dark carving
of the window-a screen covered the lower
half of it above it he could see the dim
interior-rugs a tabouret and near it a girl
sitting with her head bowed and her hands
lying unclasped in her lap

  kahleel looked long upon her and said
 ali hassan thou shalt go to paradise yet
for this boon thy pearl hath brought me
he heard a camel grunting down the
lane ran lightly back to his date palm slid
down it quickly and took his place beside
the beggar with his cloak wrapped about his
head a caravan trailed past bound for the
sea and in the trail of it limped najob
xzoura the tracks of tears still showed
on the old mans cheeks and when kahleel
arose before him he-said thou too
misfortune on misfortune it was not
enough that the fat turk took my best rug
but thou must step in and claim two
pounds 

   not so said kahleel smiling  i
saved thee from a whipping and perhaps
worse i saw that thou wert an old man
and a coast dweller and i stepped in to
save thee now i have come to give thee
back the two pounds in english gold

   young man said najob azoura turn-
ing his watery eyes upon the youth  it is
impiety to jest with thy elders no man
parteth with what treasure he hath

   i have not come to jest with thee said
kahleel here are thy two pieces of gold
he held them out to the old man who
took them weighed them on his finger-tip
and pocketed them he picked up his rugs
without a word struck three times upon
the gate and it swung open to him kahleel
made as if to follow him but the old man
said quickly nay i allow no strangers
within my gates

  k the house is thine said kahleel
shrugging his shoulders  but there is other
business that i would talk with thee

   then shall it be done here said the

merchant dropping his bundle  what
wouldst thou with me

  kahleel was silent for a time and then
he said  najob azoura hast thou ever
been a lover

  the old man arose

   this is not business he said

  kahleel seized his wrist and pulled him
down to his seat

   but that is what i would talk to thee
of

   i put such foolishness out of my head
years ago said najob

   then why answered the young man
 do you keep a girl mewed up within your
house

  the old man made as if to rise again
but kahleel clung to his wrist

   thou shalt hear me he said  or i
will tell ali hassan that thou art a kid-
naper how came that girl to be with
thee  

   i found her in the desert said najob
azoura  she was in a caravan that was
raided she alone escaped and fell into the
hands of a chief oi the beni lam she
told me her tale and i bought her for three
camels her father will pay me well to
bring her back to him

  kahleel listened intently

   that is where i lost -track of her he
said  i followed her caravan which was
bound from howeit to maskat but i lost
it and came hither

   and what is the maid to thee said
the old merchant

   she is my beloved said kahleel sim-
ply  and thou shalt give her to me

   her father shall give her to thee said
the rug merchant  my task is to take
her to him

   that is the point of the whole matter
said kahleel looking upon the ground  her
father will not give her to me because i am
poor he sent her away thinking that she
would have fled with me

   she hath said that her father will give
me a hundred pounds in english gold and
pay me for the camels i gave for her is
that true

   aye said kahleel  the maid speaks
truth

   but what canst thou give  lover


the argosy

   i did thee a good turn in the market
place this morning not knowing that we
should meet again said kahleel  i have
naught else to offer

   then shalt thou chaffer with her
father said najob azoura

   it is hard said the young man  for
a lover to speak to one who hath not been
a lover but as thou wishest for joy in
paradise give her to me

   nay said the old man rising  i have
had loss enough be patient my kahleel
there are other maids in the world and
fathers not so hard of heart how didst
thou know she was here

   i  saw a vision from heaven which
marked this house

   where sawest thou that vision

   where but in ali hassans pearl

   body of allah groaned the merchant
 shall i never be done with him

  he shuffled through the gate and slammed
it shut leaving kahleel and the beggar
alone in the lane the youth arose walked
a few irresolute steps but dropped into
place again for ali hassans slave ran down
the road shouting  make way for ali

chapter iii

dice-and a drug

the quick patter of the donkeys hoofs
sounded against the walls and ali
hassan followed by his retinue rode up to
the gate the slave struck at the gate with
his stick and it opened sloly to him ali
hassan rode through kahleel slipped in
with the last of his train and dropped out of
sight behind a huge water-jar the sultans
viceroy urged his beast across the court-
yard and stopped before najobs door

  najob azoura he bellowed here
is ali hassan come to do business with
thee

  the old man put his bare head out of an
upper window and said  thou hast done
but too much business with me already ali
hassan

   come down merchant said his guest
laughing broadly  mayhap i did do you
some wrong this morning and mayhap i
have come to set it right

  najob azoura stared down at him for a
moment then set the dusty turban on his
head and came into the courtyard

   here i am he said spreading out his
hands  allahs plaything and thine

   i did thee some wrong this morning
said ali hassan generously  but my con-
science hath reproached me and i have
come to right it but first thou shalt show
me all thy treasures great and small
najob pointed to the rugs that still lay
in the courtyard-opened them painfully
and turned them one by one while ali
stood with his hands in his girdle and
watched him

   and is that all he said when his
host had finished

   yes i swear it by the beard of the
prophet

  nonsense scoffed ali an old rat
like thee hath more than this in his burrow
come if thou wilt not show me thy treas-
ure i must find it for myself

  he walked into the house and najob
cried  have i not sworn there is nothing
there

   why should an old man like thee take
a house instead of going to the caravan-
sary said ali  there must be some-
thing of price about thee somewhere

  he strode into the house laughing silent-
ly and the merchant followed with his
fingers in his beard ali padded through
the corridorr looked into the long coffee-
room and set his foot upon the stair

   allah save us screeched the old man
 art thou a christian to walk so into wo-
mens quarters

   hear ye old najob said ali turning
to him  knowest thou of a woman in
this city who is the most beautiful of her
kind

   i keep not with houris said the mer-
chant

  ali shot a keen glance at his host

   is it thy wife old rat

   no said the merchant looking into
the courtyard  there is no woman here

   then said ali  there can be no harm
in my walking above

  najob azoura spread out his hands and
said  art thou god to see into mees
hearts so
alis revenge-and allahs



  not god cried his guest  but ali
hassan who hath the pearl which telleth
all i will be plain with thee najob a
young poet came to me this morning-the
same youth who saved thee in the bazaar
he spoke so eloquently of his love that he
moved me to seek the most beautiful of her
sex in this city i looked into my pearl but
i saw naught but an old rat and i read that
to mean that she was with thee thy face
telleth me that i am right

  najob azoura shrugged his shoulders and
said  i bought her at a great price from
the bedouin she hath been an expense to
me from beginning to end

  ali hassan struck him a blow across his
shoulders that almost threw him off his feet

   there is sense in thy talk now he
said  but to get anything out of najob
azoura is like getting moisture out of a
desert rock why do we stand here talking
like two dry camels grunting for water
thou shalt have coffee such as hath never
passed thy lips before

  he led the way-into the long room
clapped his hands and said l coffee-the
best thou hast ever made

  the slave ran to the donkey and brought
the coffee mill the pot and the charcoal-
lamp he blew up the spark of fire in the
lamp and brewed a pot of thick brown
coffee flavored with cinnamon and citron

   now then said the great man after
his pipe was alight and he was settled
among the cushions  now we may talk
business mind you i would not take the
young mans maid unless necessary butmy
pearl hath not told me that this was his
maid wilt thou give her to me

   all treasure hath price said the mer-
chant  even a womans beauty

  even a womans beauty exclaimed
ali  especially a womans beauty old
bag of bones letme see her

   no said his host a bit fearfully
 thou wilt run away with her all thy
men are armed

   i give thee my word said ali  that
i will not take her without just recom-
pense

  just recompense whined the mer-
chant  thine ideas of just payment
jump not with mine

  body of allah ejaculated ali sud-
denly  thinkest thou i have no pleas-
ure in life but to sit here and gabble with

thee

  najob arose went to the foot of the
stairs and called  mirza

  a voice answered  i come and ali
said touching one of his fingers  voice
of the nightingale

   thy face must be covered said the
merchant a faint footfall sounded on the
stairs and the girl stood in the door she
hesitated and najob azoura said  sit
thou here beside me the girl crossed to
him quickly and dropped to the floor at
his side

   my child said the merchant  here
is a man-the great ali hassan of the
oasis of nejed he ruleth here for the
sultan he hath heard of thy beauty and
hath come to see thee

   the girl was silent and ali said

   dressed in green as a daughter of the
faithful should be small but ripely
formed fingers long and taper thou hast
naught to fear from me let me see thy
face

  she was silent and motionless until ali
stirred among his cushions and then najob
azoura said  there is no help child
the horse goeth where the curb moveth
him so must we

  the girl put up her veil and when ali
had looked long upon the small oval face
he touched another finger and said

   eyes of the gazelle what is thy price
najob azoura

   thou canst not sell me said the girl
quickly  i-am not thine to sell my
father will pay thee richly for me

   but thy father said the merchant
 is far away and ali is here there is no
help that i can see and since i was at
some expense about thee thou wilt not
grudge that i make it good and remem-
ber that ali hassan is rich and can make
thee happy i can face thy father with a
clear conscience for i shall have done what
i can

   thy father will thank him said ali
hassan  i came to buy thee for a slave
but i will make thee my wife

  he paused and threw out his arm to


the argosy

emphasize the honor of his offer but the
girl said

   how can a wife be a true wife when
her heart is elsewhere

   and is thy heart elsewhere

   yes  ali it is- the merchant
touched her arm and she finished  it is
in my howeit by the sea

   but then said ali rubbing his fat
palms together  once thou hast forgotten
the sea thou wilt be happy men call the
nejed the paradise of arabia and i will
make it doubly a paradise for thee the
girl was silent and ali said  what is thy
price najob

    first said the old man  there is the
matter of the rug in which thou owest me
thirty-five pounds then there is the price
of the camels which i gave for her and
those come to some forty more she hath
told me that her father would give me a
hundred more for her and there has been
the expense of food and transport count-
ing the reward that i miss the total is one
hundred and ninety pounds ali hassan
 i will give thee a hundred and fifty
said ali  for it is likely that her father
would have thee jailed instead of reward-
ing thee thou shalt have an order on the
goldsmith with whom my money is lodged
najob azoura drew up his shoulders and
said  allah send that i profit by this
bargain but i fear not thou seest girl i
am not to blame

    stop i said the girl throwing back her
veil  art thou a gambler ali hassan
 aye said ali  as all arabs are i
am one too that is used to winning
then said the girl  i will gamble
with thee ali hassan for myself we
will cast the dice and the one that turneth
up the fifth ace is winner if i win thou
wilt set me free if thou art winner then
will i go with thee without more ado

   beard of the prophet exclaimed ali
in delight  what a spirit is in that small
body but thou wilt keep thy bargain
my dove

   yes ali i will leave the house and go
with thee

   allah save us cried ali  to gam-
ble for thee never was there such a
stake maid i would follow thee across

the desert even hating it as i do come

 i have dice here in my girdle

  no said the girl  we will not gamble
 with dice of thine

  as wise chuckled ali  as thou art
 clever but dost thou think that i would
 stake all on dice of thine

  nay cut in najob azoura  since
 you will gamble i have dice within my
 pack which i will sell at two drachmas a
 pair

  old rat  laughed ali  thy poor life
 is bound up in money-bags

 najob azoura brought a handful of dice
 and the girl said  pick thou one and i
 will pick one then there can be no ques-
 tion

 she arose brought her cushion to alis
 feet and sat herself there

 ali touched his third finger  the
 grace of the dove he said

  first she said  we must throw to see
 who hath first cast

 she took the dice in her small palm and
 threw a five and a four rolled up

 nine shouted ali picking up the
 cubes  mohammed and the angels be
 with me now he cast and turned up
 four

 it is thy chance first he said
  the heavens are with thee

 she rubbed the cubes together in her
 palm spun them and turned up an ace

  one shouted ali

 she cast again but no ones came up
 and ali swooped upon the dice he rolled
 two aces in succession-then a blank the
 next cast was a blank and the next

 then the girl threw two aces but after
 that a blank

  now said ali with his eyes gleaming
  watch 

 even najob azoura craned his thin neck
 as the dice fell but no aces came up the
 girl took the ivory cubes in her hand and
 smiled at ali

  ali hassan she taunted  after all
 there is a womans heart in that great body
 of thine see how thy hand trembled and
 mine is as steady as a rock for all that i
 am gambling for my freedom thou wilt
 keep the bargain

  aye said ali
alis revenge-and allahs



   i will haunt thee if thou dost not
said the girl  be sure that i will die
before i will be thy wife if thou keepest
not to the promise and mayhap thou
wilt die with me

   and what if i do laughed ali
how better could i go to paradise than
with thee

  the girl put her hand down without
throwing the dice

    no said ali  i trust thee not they
must roll

  she took them up and with her eyes
fixed on him dropped them on the floor
they rolled-a four came up and an ace

    there said the girl as the tears came
into her eyes  i have cast the fifth ace
thou wilt let me go now

   women may talk large said najob
azoura  but they come to tears in the
end come child

   no roared ali springing to his feet
 by allah she shall not go

   thou wilt  not break thy bargain
said the girl faintly  thou wilt rue it
there is a liell for perjurers 

  i love thee said ali i will not
give thee up dice or no dice thou art
mine i will make thee happy for thou
shalt rule my house and me and all that i
have

   rule thy house and thee echoed the
girl  i would see thee dead first

   a slow flush crept over hassans face

    thou shalt rue that my bird he said
slowly  when i have caged thee

   nay child expostulated najob
 calmness bringeth more than haste

  the girl turned and sped from the room
but the white figure of kahleel met her in
the dark corridor he touched her arm
and whispered  i am here beloved and
have heard go back

  she wrapped her veil about her head and
returned to the room

   i thought so said ali  there are
those outside to turn thee back and not
too gently he clapped his hands and
when the slave glided in said  a donkey
litter from the caravansary

   the girl took her place by the side of the
old merchant

    najob said ali  bring me the parch-

ment and ink and i will make an order
upon the goldsmith when this was done
the three sat in silence until the litter came
to the door

   come my bird said ali  we will go
home together like the loving pair that we
will become

  she went quietly into the courtyard and
mounted into the litter without touching
the hand that ali put out to her

    farewell little onei said the old mer-
chant-  have patience i looked into alis
pearl this morning and i saw that which
maketh me believe that heaven will save
the innocent

  as the procession crossed the square
ali hassan cast a longing glance at the
coffee-house he said to his slave  ba-
tuta take this maid home and if she escape
god help thee i will leave the others with
thee to help guard her

  alone he trotted across to the coffee-
house left his donkey and walked in he
did not go to his usual comer instead he
walked on through to a smaller and more
private room

   mustufa he said to the proprietor
 coffee of course and-mustufa hast
thou anything else that a good moham-
medan like myself might drink

  mustufa looked knowingly at him and
said i have no wine  ali but an
excellent bottle of arrak

   there can be no harm in my taking a
drop said ali hassan  since this is one
of the great days of my life of course
my mustufa it should not be known that
so stanch a follower of the prophet as
myself should drink liquors but thou know-
est that some exception may be made in
the case of rulers and the like

  mustufa brought a wicker-bound bottle
and a cup and the great man drained one
cup and then another of the liquor he
lighted his long pipe and sat in the little
room with a smile upon his heavy features
and his hands clasped across his girdle
a flush came upon his face as the liquor
stirred his sluggish blood

  across the square he saw the tall figure
of the youth kahleel he arose put his
head out of the small window and roared

 kahleel youth poet come hither


the argosy

  the young man stopped looked for a
moment and then walked quickly across
the square ali hassan leaped up and
put both hands on the youths shoulders as
lie entered the room

   ho young poet he roared  fortune
is with me to-day i have to thank thee
for two things-first it was thou who put
into my head the idea of getting a wife
second thou art here to let me thank thee
mustufa another cup

   nay said the young man looking at
the wicker-bound flask  the koran for-
biddeth that

   as thou wilt said ali hassan  and
perhaps thou art right i doubt if thy
young head could stand it

  mustufa came in with the second cup
and said  ali hassan art thou not
afraid to be here without thy retinue no
man hath more friends than thou and no
man hath more enemies

  no scoffed ali what man dare
touch me and this youth is here who is
my friend

   aye said kahleel  i will take good
care that no harm cometh to him

  mustufa shrugged his shoulders and
went out and kahleel filled alis cup and
said

   thou wilt let me say a verse over
the drink

   yes young poet and let it be some-
thing about love eyes of the nightingale
voice of the gazelle and the rest of the bird
talk

   i will put a charm on this cup 
ali said the young man  so that thou
shalt have such dreams of love and poetry
as never thou hadst before

   nay no dreams said the big man
good-naturedly  but give it a blessing

    i will give thee a blessing of flowers
said kahleel raising the cup  what of
her that is straight as a young palm-shoot
hath a breath like that of the rose and
eyes like the black poppy that bringeth
sleep

   good cried ali would that thou
and i might match beauties youth hast
thou found thy treasure yet

   no said kahleel  but the night is
not done

    thou wilt find her said ali when he
had finished the drink  the pearl never
faiteth another blessing

   kahleel filled the cup again and said
 what of the good man the good man
walketh in the straight path to paradise
but the man of evil heart walketh in the
maze which leadeth only to death

   ali was silent for a long time and then
hiccuped i liked the other blessing
better kahleel what was ii that bot-
tle

    arrak naught else

   body of allah said the great man
with a long sigh  it worketh as no arrak
ever worked before i am sleepy youth
 then sleep o am hassan

    nay said ali shaking his shoulders
 i will arouse me for i have other business
in hand yet i will have one more draft
of this fill the cup for it escapeth my
hand somehow the blessing of the flow-
ers what of her that is as straight as
young palm-shoot-hath a breath like the
rose-and what was the rest

    is as soothing as the black poppy that
bringeth sleep said the young man

   aye the black poppy that bringeth
sleep murmured ali he staggered to
his feet and said  i must rouse me
mustufa 

   the proprietor glided in and ali said

 knowest thou what i have brought to
my house this day

    i have heard said mustufa  that a
mule litter hath gone thither

   aye old fox but this time i take a
wife

    a wife said mustufa  i have heard
thee say that that was worse than tooth-
ache

   and so i thought until i saw this
maid what a mother she will make for
my sons

    one can never be sure said mustufa

 she may have another man in her head 
and be sure she will make thee pay for
it

   another man in her head exclaimed
ali hazily  but i have a way to find out

	mustufa thou knowest not the advan-
tage of being in the confidence of heaven
if she have another man in her head i
alis revenge-and allahs



shall know it and she shall pay for it
not i

   he dragged at his pouch with fumbling
fingers and took out the pearl a ray
of the western sun struck in through the
window and he held the pearl up to it

   tell me o lovely jewel what other
man there is in this maids head

   he stood swaying with the heavy eye-
lids scarce open watching the shifting pisy
of color in the gem suddenly the eyes
opened wide and his hands fell to his
sides

    mustufa he said  that arrak of
thine is queer stuff he looked again and
said clearly  youth i see thy face in the
jewel

   kahleel rose and stood close to the
door

    i cannot help what thy jewel shows
thee he said evenly  if thou wilt be
a fool ali hassan no man can stop thee

    she was thy treasure

   he lunged unsteadily at kahleel tried
vainly to bring his wits together then the
drug which kahleel had put in his drink
overcame him and he fell among the ta-
bles mustufa spread out his hands and
smiled

   the arrak hath been too much for
him

    keep him here out of sight said
kahleel  it will not do to let any one
see the sultans viceroy thus i will send
his slaves to him

chapter iv

pursuit

at dawn ali hassan awoke batuta
crouched at his feet looking at him
with mingled devotion and fear the great
man rolled over sat up and put his hands
to his head

    i have had such dreams he said
 mustufa what do i here

   mustufa rose from the ground where he
was brewing coffee and said  the youth
and ali hassan sat here last night

    i remember he said  i had some
of thy villainous arrak

   he arose walked to the jet of water and

drank deep mustufa placed the coffee
before him and when he had tasted that
his head began to clear

   it was like no arrak that ever i tasted
he said  there was a girl

  aye said mustufa i saw the
donkey litter cross the square

   so said ali  i must be gone i
have kept her waiting too long

  he arose but the slave threw himself
at his feet and clasped him about the
knees  mercy master he cried do
not whip me for bringing evil news

  ali looked down upon him and said
 thou evil son of an evil mother what
tidings hast thou

   thou wilt not have me whipped

   no said ali hassan  but tell thy
news quickly

  lie walked to the fountain plunged his
arms into it and bathed his face then
he sat down in the corner and said  i
will listen

    yesterday at sundown said the slave
 we took a maid to the house ali has-
san no sooner had we arrived there than
a youth came the same that was with thee
in the morning and said that thou wert
in danger here

   we came to thee but the youth had
said that thou wert not to be disturbed and
we let thee lie one only stayed behind

    at midnight he dragged himself hither
wounded and told his tale the young
man after we were gone forced his way
into the house-wounded the lone guard
with a knife bound him and took the maid
in the litter after some hours he got him-
self free from his bonds and came hither
and told us allah knoweth ali hassan
that i am blameless and thou hast prom-
ised not to have me whipped

   the flush spread over the masters face
and the veins inhis forehead swelled

   tho shalt not be whipped he said
 but where are the others 

   at that evil news master they fled
from fear of thee 

  ali hassan sprang to his feet and his
fingers curled

  i could kill thee he choked

 thou raven but there is other work to
be done


the argosy

 his donkey stood outside the coffee-
 house with his patient nose almost to the
 ground ali leaped upon him and galloped
 across to the caravansary the caravan
 provider squatted over a tiny fire

ali galloped up to him and said
 hast thou seen anything of a rat-eaten
merchant called najob azoura

  aye said the keeper of camels  he
 left in the night for mecca

  alone

  aye

  knowest thou of a young man tall and
 dark kahleel

 yes he came but yesterday

  and hath gone away

  i saw him not but one hath told me
 that he went away toward the sea last
 night

  alone

  no there were two riding upon one
 camel-a gray oman

 ali hassan leaped from his donkey

  thou shalt give me a horse he said
  i must overtake them

  a horse said the provider of cara-
 vans  i have but one and what knowest
 thou of horses

  enough thick wit choked his cus-
 tomer  to ride it

  but thou wilt not go into the desert
 ali hassan expostulated the other  the
 desert is worse than the sea and thou art
 a townsman born and bred

  fear not for me said ali taking a
 pistol from the donkeys saddle and put-
 ting it in his girdle but give me a
 horse

  thou knowest i have but one said
 the man stubbornly  and she is of pure
 desert breed if she be lost i cannot re-
 place her

  allah knoweth said ali hassan in a
 low voice  i try to be patient with thee

 i	will give thee an order on the goldsmith
 and thou shalt fill in what figures thou
 wilt if she come not back to thee thou
 wilt have enough to buy a dozen

 the caravan keeper shrugged his shoul-
 ders and led the way to a stable which
 formed a part of his own dwelling a
 neigh greeted him and he said  it is i
 beloved

  he dropped the bars and a round-
bellied slim-legged mare stepped out into
the square

   is she swifter asked ali hassan
 than the gray oman

   can the falcon outfly the buzzard
said the caravan keeper scornfully

   saddle her quickly cried ali  here
is thy order on the goldsmith

    what seekest thou asked the keeper
of camels  another pearl

   speak not to me of what i seek said
ali hassan the mare now bore her sad-
dle and he leaped into it

   thou wilt ride her without a bridle
and water-skins and forage and food said
the owner of the horse scornfully  ali
hassan i think- he did not finish but
touched his forehead bound a bundle of
forage and a water-skin on the saddle and
touched the mare on the flank

   ride her gently he said  thou art
a heavy man she can do forty hours
marching without water but that is in the
coolest weather and at her own pace

  the rider touched her with his staff and
she trotted smoothly from the square and
into that lane called the sea road there
ali put her to the gallop and came quickly
to the edge of the oasis there the verdure
ended and the desert rolled up to it like a
great sea behind him lay the oasis with
its low walls and cloudy palm tops ahead
a shimmering stretch of sand and bare sun-
burnt rock

  a broad camel track stretched ahead of
him he turned into it the sound of the
horses feet ceased the sand came above
her fetlocks at every step she fell into
the desert pace-a gentle canter-but ali
hassan struck her with his staff and she
threw up her head and broke into a swift
gallop

  the sun was up and strong ali put his
hand to his head for he wore only the fez
still he wrapped his cloak about his head
and let his hands rest on the pommel of the
saddle

until well past noon the horse did not
falter in her swift pace then she stum-
bled ali struck her with his staff she
picked up speed again but at the end of a
quarter of an hour she fell again to a
alis revenge-and allahs



walk ali steruck her again and again about
the head

   thou art a dog he screamed  and
no horse

  she threw up her head and galloped
wildly while he kept the staff drumming
on her flanks the broad camel track had
dwindled by now it split in two and the
rider pulled up the mare dropped her
head to her knees and stood with her fore
feet wide apart the sun had passed the
meridian it was that hour in the desert
when man and beast take rest in whatever
shade there is at hand

  ali looked at the two paths took the
pearl from his pouch and said thou
hast never failed me yet he held it so
that the blinding sun fell on it and saw
for a time nothing but the opalescent rush
of color

   show me where he whimpered-
 show me where they are

  a tiny picture formed itself under his
eyes-a black dot first and then from it
came a faithful picture very small and very
dim of a camel and two figures upon it

   aye groaned ali  but where

  still holding the pearl to the sun he
turned into that path which led to the
right the picture shifted into the pearl
until it was almost lost he turned back
into the path which led to the left and
the tiny camel stood full in the middle of
the gem

  allah hath spoken cried the man
and struck the horse again she struggled
to keep the swift gallop but faltered more
and more frequently while her rider beat
her until his arm was numb the fine
nostrils showed a touch of red her eyes
rolled from side to side and the chestnut
sides grew black with sweat ali cursed

  at sundown she stumbled to her knees
and did not rise ali rolled from the sad-
dle to the ground lay for a time inert then
staggered dizzily to his feet the mare
turned her head to him and groaned ali
tried to mount again his hand touched the
water-skin he tore it from the saddle and
drank deeply at the touch of water hot
as it was his brain cleared

  softly he said no horse no re-
venge

  he filled his cap with water and held
it for the horse to drink she sucked up
the water and he filled his cap again the
faithful beast struggled to her feet and
plodded through the sand ah tried to
walk by her side but the sand burned
through his shoes and the rocks cut his
feet

  the stars came out and a small moon
a shadow followed alongside the two-the
slim-legged horse and the bulky man on her
back close to midnight the mare put up
her head whinnied and broke into a trot
ahead of them a star burned upon the sur-
face of the desert-a dim star shining in
a pool of water scarcely larger than the
saddle a patch so foul that it stank man
and horse drank ali dropped the bundle
of forage before the horse she nibbled
at it stretched herself out on the sand and
drew long breaths

  ali could not rest long always the fed
vision of his revenge danced before his eyes
walking about the mare he was suddenly
aware of a single camel track that stretched
ahead of him he did not doubt that it
was the track of his prey he kicked the
mare in the side and she struggled to her
feet lie mounted and the two pushed
on through the sand

  an hour past dawn he came upon them
he topped a small rise and almost at his
feet saw the two sitting with their bag-
gage made ready for the day at sight of
the horse the gray oman camel threw up
its head and ambled a few steps but kah-
leel and mirza sitting with their backs
to him did not see ali hassan as he slid
from his horse and crept up to them

chapter v

the rat dines

 a nd what shalt thou call me said
     the girl  when i am thy wife

   i shall call thee alls pearl laughed
kahleel  for it was by means of that
that i came to thee

  the girl shuddered

   what a pig sawest thou ever such
a fat one

 i never saw such a fat-witted one
	the argosy

said kahleel and the rocks echoed the girls
laughter

  ali hassan had crept so close that he
could have touched them he took the
pistol from his belt it was a muzzle-loader
with one charge he could fire but that
would leave him without protection on his
return journey he clubbed the pistol and
struck once

  kalileel pitched forward with a groan
the girl screamed and whirled about

  ali hassan

   aye said their pursuer  the fat pig
with the thick wits

  he put out his hand toward her but
she fled away from him among the rocks

   one at a time said ali  catch one
of a pair and the mate will come

  he touched the man with his foot kah-
leel stirred and groaned ali raised his
pistol but lowered it again instead of
firing he cut-the cord which bound their
luggage and tied kahleel hand and foot

  kahleel opened his eyes and gazed up
at the face above ehimr-a face in which
the eyes were shot with blood and the lips
black and swollen almost to the size of
ripe figs he turned his head and saw
mirza crouching among the rocks

   why dost thou not kill me he said
 thou canst not frighten me by looking
at me i am no child to be frightened at
goblins

  i am studying how to kill thee said
ali hassan

   take me said mirza  and let him
go

   and why exulted the pursuer
 should i not kill him and take thee
too

  the girl said nothing but moved closer
to her lover and put out her hand as if to
touch him but ali seized her by the wrist

   i have a heart said kahleel  as oth-
ers have put the point of thy knife under
my fifth rib and thy revenge will be done

   that were too much kindness said
ali musingly  if we were but in the city
now i would know how to deal with thee
i could give thee such a drug as would
make thee an idiot the rest of thy days or
have thee garroted or killed in a hundred
wrays but i am no desert dweller and

know not how men may best revenge them-
selves in this waste

  the sun was fully up now and a beam
struck across the rock

   move him out of the sun said the
girl  if there is any pity in thee

  ali looked at her a moment and
laughed wildly

   maid he cried  i have to thank
thee his blood will not be upon my head
but upon thine 	

  still holding the girl by the wrist he
fumbled among the baggage and found the
tent pegs he drove four of them deep into
the sand with a bit of rock he let the
girls hand go and said  if thou art
quiet i may have mercy on him

  she sank to the ground and wept bit-
terly while ali rolled his helpless victim
between the tent pegs and bound him hand
and foot to them kahleel lay stretched
upon the burning sand like a man on a
cross

   ali hassan said the young man
 thou shalt- be kind to the girl or i will
haunt thee

  ali laughed again

   thy spirit will see things that will
please thee he said  if it comes to my
harem

  he sat down threw out his arms and
said

   body of allah i am hungry for the
first time what hast thou here for a fam-
ished man nejed dates samh and clot-
ted cheese

  when he had devoured as much of their
food as he could he said  now this is
the mercy i will show him maid i will
leave the rest of the food in his sight
so that if he should escape from his bonds
he shall not starve thou and i will ride
the camel

  he walked toward the camel but the
oman threw up its head and trotted away
a few steps he tried again but it evaded
him and he went back to his horse mount-
ed it and tried to catch the camel the
horse was too weary to go beyond a shuf-
fling trot no matter how much he beat it

   the devil rot thy bones he cried in a
fury pulled his pistol from his girdle and
shot at the beast it broke into a long
alps revenge-and allahs



gallop and disappeared in the shimmering
heat waves

  ali rode back to his victims and dis-
mounted

   the gray oman hath settled thy fate 
maid he- said  i would have saved
thee but the horse can carry but one
thou shalt lie here by him

  kahleel groaned and said  it will
break my heart ali hassan to see her
wither-

   hadst thou shown any care for my
broken heart said ali hassan  things
would not have been as they are

  mirza laid herself down willingly beside
her lover while the sultans viceroy drova
two more tent pegs into the sand he
bound her side by side with her lover
there was not enough of the rope to tie
her he took a leather thong from his
saddle and tied one wrist with it

   kahleel said mirza suddenly

  kahleel did not answer and the-girl con-
tinued the koran sayeth that the true
wife can have no greater pleasure than to
die with her husband thou shalt not
mourn for me for i shall be happy in
dying with thee- we shall cross the long
bridge that leadeth into paradise hand and
hand death cannot be painful to us for
i shall sing to thee and tell thee the long
tales which the queen told to ilaroun-al-
raschid art thou listening

   tell him the tale of the pearl cut in
ali  the pearl which the prophet gave to
ayesha and which hath come to ali has-
san tell him that tale for it was the pearl
that brought me to you

   i heard no one speak said the girl

 nor shalt thou hear any voice but mine
she looked up at the sky with wide-open
eyes  i will tell thee the tale of the
cobbler-how he made shoes for the
queen

   i am sorry cut in ali hassan  that
i cannot stay to hear thee but thy tale
might charm me from my purpose here
is audience enough for thee -a rat - a
long-whiskered desert rat that looketh like
nothing so much as najob azoura

  a jerboa rat had hopped from his bur-
row in the rocks and stood up on his strong
hind legs and watched these invaders of his

peace ali hassan walked up to his horse
and mounted he looked about again for
the gray oman camel but it was nowhere
in sight

   fare thee well ali hassan said mir-
za as he put his heels to the horse  and
in thy death remember me

   fare thee well witch answered ali
 and when thy end cometh think of my
garden with the three jets of water and
the cucumber vines 

  he pushed his horse up the little slope
and back along his track the red flecks
that had danced before his eyes were gone
his head was clear and he looked oarefully
at the mount under him there was no
question of galloping now she shuffled
along with her head down and her loins
drawn up he felt the water-skin it
scarcely bulged under his- hand the bun-
dle of forage was thin he had left most of
it at the pool where they had halted at
midnight

  at the end of the second hour he wetted
his own lips and gave the mare the restof
what water there was in the skin gave her
also the rest of the forage

  all morning she kept up her shuffling
pace a little past midday he came sud-
denly upon the place where the pool had
been a broad track cut across his own
trail there the water was gone drunk up
by some thirsty bedouin band who had
crossed there already the bottom of the
pool had baked aid curled into dry chips
under the fierce sun

  the mare turned her head and looked
at her rider ali climbed painfully down

   softly ali hassan he said  no
horse no life

  ahead of him lay eighteen hours of stiff
marching how much his horse could do
he did not know being a city dweller born
and bred neither did he know enough to
give the horse her head and let her go to
some haven to which her instinct led her
instead he stood by her with the reins over
his arm about him lay the confused track
of the caravan he turned and looked at
his horse decided that she could not make
the long march into nejed neither could
he without water

  half fearfully he laid his hand upon his


the argosy

pouch hitherto the pearl had helped him
in matters not of life and death if it should
fail him now it was a question only of
hours before he would be curling under
that sun

  he took the pearl from his pouch and
held it up to the sun the play of light
in it was so fierce that it almost blinded
him he muttered his wish and looked long
in the pearl before the wavering color set-
tled into the tiny picture then he saw-
not some oasis to which he might go-not
some friendly camp of desert dwellers-
but the face of mirza as he had last seen
the girl looking straight to heaven with
wide-open eyes for a moment the heavy
pounding of his heart ceased horse and
desert melted into a whirling maelstrom

   curse thee he screamed traitor
but look ashe might all that he could
see was that small upturned face then
his reason shaken by his physical suffer-
ings in the desert and what he had done
tottered ali hassan rubbed his hands and
babbled like a child

   at least i shall see them die

  he climbed into the saddle and turned
the unwilling horse upon the long return
journey-back to where he had left kah-
leel and mirza exposed to the sun he
rolled in the saddle singing cursing repeat-
ing stray bits of conversations long past
they went on through the terrific heat of
the rest hour-just past noon-went on as
the sun went down and a moon came up

  when ali saw the little rise ahead of
him behind which he had left his victims
his head cleared somewhat he tumbled
out of the saddle and stood listening for
a groan-weeping-even screaming stoop-
ing so as not to be seen and laughing si-
lently to himself he stole up to the brow
of the ridge and-looked over

  the place below was empty kahleel
and mirza were gone the tent pegs were
there and the ropes and the prints of their
bodies showed clear in the strong moon-
light in the little hollow there was but
one living thing-an old jerboa rat who sat
on his strong hind legs and nibbled at a
piece of leather thong

  true to its carrion instinct the jerboa rat

the 

had gnawed the leather thong which had
bound one of the girls wrists and so had
set them free if ali hassan had been a
desert dweller he would have known that
the nature of the jerboa rat is to gnaw
dead flesh or anything like dead flesh even
now it was some time before ali saw what
had liberated his victims

  when the truth did penetrate through
the whirling maze of his mind he ran upon
the rat and screamed  so it wathou that
set them free

  but the rat dodged between his hands
into the inky shadows of the rock he
could see its eyes shining like two points
of green fire and tore at the rock until
his fingers bled but the rodent drew deeper
within to safety

  ali raged up and down threw sand upon
his head and beat his breast his passion
cleared a bit after a time he went to the
top of the ridge his horse was gone she
had shuffled away in the night to some
refuge to which her keen nostrils guided
her

  once more the pearl came out of his
pouch the silver and violet of the night
played along its smooth sides but there
was nothing in the pearl but the face of
mirza as ali had last seen her-wide-open
eyes upturned face

  he dashed the pearl to the groand and
put his heel upon it chattering with rage
then he saw the old rat nibbling again
at the bit of leather he threw himself
upon it but it slid between his feet and
back into its burrow ali hassan sat down
outside the little hole in the rock to wait

  close to dawn he awoke-something
tugged at his foot he raised his head and
looked down to see the rat nibbling at the
soft leather shoes a touch of foam came
to his lips and his voice broke into a
falsetto wail as he threw himself upon-his
enemy

  again it escaped him and again he sat
down and smiled craftily as he settled him-
self down to wait

   but in such a duel of patience there could
be but one victor the next dawn saw the
rat making his meal off the soft leather
shoes in peace

what has already happened

a simple british sailor or so he thought himself arthur lake son to tobit lake cobbler
was in reality of noble blood-the son of prince charles of viana and eleanor of durham

    tobit knew the secret but it died with him when in a fit of rage he was strangled by
don juan de seseca count of sansito private secretary to ferdinand of aragon tobit had
stubbornly refused to part with the parchment attesting the youths identity

    finding tobit dead young lake as we must call him discovered the parchment and a store
of gold then visiting his sweetheart judith merton daughter of the diplomat sir thomas who
finding the two together waxed wroth arthur returned to his lodgings to find a yokel whom
he had left in charge vanished-and the money and parchment stolen ali that he now possessed
were a few gold pieces and a miniature of his mother whose name he did not know

    hearing a movement within the room arthur pursued an unseen intruder through the window
cutting off one of his fingers ere he could escape-and later was accepted as a common sailor
on the ship hopeful in which seseca and sir thomas and his daughter were sailing

    but little did the young man suspect the sea of intrigue upon which he was embarking
mertons interview with seseca-who wore his hand bandaged-might have told him much
could he have overheard it he would have learned that he was indeed noble-royal even but
aboard the ship when he had sought audience with seseca or sansito the latter talking to sir
thomas said  i will excuse you

     i would rather be present the old man objected

    you will go sansito made no effort to soften his insolent command

chapter x

seseca lost

a t that moment arthur lake came into
f the cabin

  sir thomas merton did not stir

 i thank you for this privilege the
sailor bowed to sansito

the spaniard acknowledged the speech
with a slight nod while he looked first at
sir thomas and then at the door but
the old courtier refused to take the hint
he feared for arthurs safety if left alone
in the power of this man

 i thought you were on watch san-
sito nervously began for the youth had
surprised his look at sir thomas  how
comes it that you are allowed to pay visits
ha

 i asked leave

 the spaniard eagerly demanded  of
 whom

  the captain

  he then knows you are with me

  he saw me come arthur replied

 sansito looked baffled

  i would talk with you alone arthur
 announced glancing meaningly at the old
 nobleman

 sansito pretended to misunderstand

 leave us luis the jew departed

  am i to speak before him arthur
 asked pointing to sir thomas

  why not the crafty spaniard de-
 manded his interest in getting sir thomas
 away had vanished since discovering that
 arthurs whereabouts were known to the
 ships captain now he had another
 scheme

 at the young mans direct insistence sir

this story began in the argosy for march 

 argosy	


the argosy

 thomas had risen and with dignity pro-
 ceeded toward the door

 stay sansitos cry was an impera-
 tive order

  what i want arthur announced sim-
 ply  concerns myself intimately so may i
 be permitted to make my request to you in
 private

  i have no secrets from my old friend
 sir thomas merton sansito said ingeni-
 ously

 arthur wasted no more words but asked
 abruptly  you are a spaniard

  yes and may one ask how you an
 englishman come to speak so easily my
 mother tongue

  i learned at sea i sailed for years
 on spanish and portuguese ships

  but you are an englishman

  yes

  how comes it that you after so many
 years at sea are still but a seaman

  i came upon this trip at the last mo-
 ment glad of any chance to work my way
 across to spain

 arthur was unaware that the interview
 was turning into a close examination of
 himself

 and what are you to do in spain
 sansito inquired

  it is of that i wish to speak i am-
 could you tell me anything concerning one
 -seseca arthur came close to his man
 and looked into his eyes

 the spaniard did not flinch but he at-
 tempted to bury his bandaged hand still
 more deeply beneath his cloak

   seseca  the count repeated   sese-
 ca is that spanish it sounds- he
 broke off and turning upon sir thpmas
 inquired did you ever hear the name
 seseca perhaps you know seseca

 the old diplomat was caught

  no he lied  i do not

 the spaniard indolently inquired of
 arthur  what do you want with this
 seseca

 i must find him the young sailor
 cried vehemently

  what for

  i-but since you cannot aid me you
 will pardon me for withholding my con-
 fidences	i

  arthur bowed low and in the following
silence hastened to depart

  as the door closed sansito whispered
admiringly  such a manner his old
grandfather could not have bettered it
he must be put out of the way-he
might-

  sir thomas started forward

   if you harm him- he began

  sansito smiled hypocritically  you
have my promise

  and so sir thomas was obliged to let
the matter rest but he thought a great
deal about it during the following days

  the weather was overcast and penetrat-
ingly cold but the wind was favorable and
the ship made good headway

  the old nobleman remained most of the
time in the cabin close beside mistress
judith who was still too ill to rise he
feared that she was suffering more from
the absence of arthur than from the rough-
ness of the sea

  he had not told her that her lover was
aboard indeed tanner acting under his
instructions had answered her questions
with the information that arthur was not
on the ship

  sir thomas who had feared this love-
match when he believed arthur too lowly
now feared it infinitely more because the
youth was so far above them

  he wished there was something he could
do for the young sailor but as yet he saw
no safe course he must get to the king
with all speed on his own account and as
far as possible keep judith out of every-
thing this was as much as he could plan

  the tenth day out was decidedly squally
and the little ship was buffeted by wind and
waves but the next morning all was calm
judith seemed better and declared that on
the following day she intended to go on
deck but that night a terrible storm came
upon them

  judith awoke suddenly and called to her
father sir thomas lit a candle and almost
at once was beside her the boat was
tossing blindly and judith on her shifting
pallet trembled to hear the confusion of
the storm and the constant running to and
fro on the deck below
the great discovery



  sir thomas clinging for support to the
stationary table strove to quiet his sick
daughter but he was himself much alarmed

  suddenly the door was flung open and
with the gust that entered the candle was
extinguished in the darkness the door was
slammed and outside a great wave was
heard sweeping the ship

   this is no safe place the voice of
arthur lake came from the ensuing mo-
mentary peace  we must make for the
cabin below this may be blown off at
any minute

  judith merton made no sound after her
single glad cry arthur weak from
lack of food and dazed with fever it seemed
right to her that her beloved should come
for her in the hour of peril

   take care sir thomas arthur
warned  the sea breaks over the deck
frequently you must watch your chance
and attempt between waves to gain en-
trance to the spaniards cabin

   but- the old man began

   there are no  buts its your only
ehance three sailors have been washed
overboard already the rudder is broken
and-

  the ominous noise of an overrushing
wave almost drowned his voice

   cling all the time to the stair-rail if
you are caught by a wave hold until it
passes then rush for the door

  as arthur spoke he lovingly lifted judith
pallet and all in his arms  ill take care
that this lady comes to no harm he an-
nounced proudly

  sir thomas opened the cabin door and
went out into the storm arthur followed

  judith nestled closer as the blast beat
upon her from the fury of the storm with-
out it seemed to her that the boat must
certainly go to the bottom beneath them it
groaned and creaked staggering in the boil-
ing blackness of spray and cloud and wind
but the girl did not care for the first time
in days she was content and happy

  sir thomas gained the lower cabin in
safety but before arthur burdened by his
precious freight could follow the little boat
was almost swamped in a mighty onslaught
of the sea

   cling to me dearest he said gently

as he let judith slip to her feet and catch-
ing her tightly about the waist he locked
his other arm through one of the rungs of
the stairs

  the water descended upon them the
ship shivered the stairs trembled like reeds
but they held to their moorings-the man
clung to them and the girl to him

  there wa a terrific wrench as the wave
subsided and in the blare of light that
came almost simultaneously with a peal of
thunder arthur saw the little turretlike
cabin formerly accupied by the mertons
torn completely from its pinnings and car-
ried away on the black hissing waves

  during the next moments he had de-
scended the few steps gained the door
opened it and deposited his charge in the
arms of her father

  after the most approved romantic fash-
ion sir thomas was beginning  i owe
my daughters life and my own to you
i can never repay-

  arthur cut him short  the only pay
i want or will take is this- he bent
and kissed the girls white lips then turned
away

   where are you going she cried

   out on deck there is work for us
every one up there 

  the door opened and closed arthur lake
was gone

chapter xi

seseca found

yhe little ship hopeful weathered the
storm but when the fury was passed
the unhappy vessel was in a sad plight
if a clear sky and gentle favorable wind
had not come with the morning it would
never have been possible in that heavy sea
to patch things together sufficiently to drag
into the iittle port where captain knee felt
it needful for them to hasten for adequate
repairs

  the nearest harbor being la coruna they
put into this little town on the coast of
galicia

  the second day of their stay there arthur
discovered that the spaniard and his man
in company with sir thomas his daughter


the argosy

 and tanner had abandoned the ship their
 departure had taken place while he was
 away on an errand for captain knee at
 the shipwrights

 the captain could tell him nothing of
 the plans of his former passengers they
 had told him they were going and they
 had gone he surmised that they had got
 enough of the sea and would make the
 remainder of their journey on land

 arthur begged to be permitted to follow
 them

  what give up another man after all
 that have been drowned and-

 arthur interrupted  you can surely get
 more men here-

  what sort pray what sort foreign-
 ers look what theyve brought upon us
 -just having them as passengers-they are
 ill luck these heathen

  spaniards are not heathen arthur ob-
 jected

  they are so mixed up with moslems
 i cant tell em apart there isnt much
 difference that i can see anyway i have
 one left aboard-

  who

  the cook-banny-

  is he spanish with that name

  yes his name is esteban but what
 could i do with such a name its no
 god-fearing name-now is it

  suppose i jump the ship arthur
 threatened

 you do and ill kill you captain
 knee exclaimed

 at this they both laughed

 the young man finally asked  may i
 have leave to go ashore this afternoon and
 see what i can-

  you may not the captain thundered

  we sail on this tide without fail and
 you sail with us

 and it turned out as the captain said
 perhaps it would not have had not the wise
 old man of the sea put arthur below os-
 tensibly to help banny in the galley but
 really where he would be safely watched

 shortly after the vessel was under way
 the young man was ordered on deck and
 assigned his usual duties

 it seemed as though there might have
 been some truth in the captains assertion

 that the spaniards were trouble-bringers
 for from now on the voyage was as easy
 as it had before been arduous arthur
 had more free time and this he spent with
 will harris to whom he spoke of judith
 merton and his plans to find her he was
 carem to avoid any mention of the locket
 that still reposed safely beside the ring and
 nine gold pieces next his skin

   he did not tell will the stoiy of the pic-
 ture and treasure it was too improbable
 will would find it hard to believe and
 arthur was too fond of this simple loyal
 friend to put such a strain upon his cre-
 dence so he kept his own counsel but he
 pondered his offairs a great deal and one
 day he asked esteban if he had ever heard
 of  seseca

   of course the cook cried every
spaniard knows that name

   arthur was almost dumfounded

    who is it he demanded

    that is the name of the great count de
sansito-secretary to- his majesty king
ferdinand of aragon hes the greatest
man in spain some say he can do any-
thing even with the king himself

    are you sure thats who seseca is

   of course im sure i never saw him
but i know he has other titles-lots of
them but first he was just plain don juan
de seseca a nobody employed by the old
king of aragon-the father of the present
king and the prince of viana him as died
so young-some say poisoned by his own
father-

    how did you hear all this

   it s no more than everybody knows
that was born and raised in spain

   funny that grandee who was our pas-
senger did not know who seseca was nor sir
thomas merton either-he was often at
the spanish court

   arthur was thinking aloud esteban in-
terposed by demanding  did you ask
them

    yes and they both said  no 

    then esteban announced with sol-
emnity  they both lied

   arthur was silent he knew that this
fellow spoke the truth but why had sir
thomas deceived him why had the
giandee lied where had they gone-and
the great discovery



why had judith willingly left with no
word for him was she angry no he
knew this could not be true she loved
him

  she had been so gentle so frail and help-
less the night of the storm that was the
last time he had seen her was all well
with her now where had they taken her
he must find her

  but first he must go where the court
was for there would be the secretary-
seseca-and from him he would learn all
that now was so mysterious

  when they arrived in the blue bay of
cadiz arthur escaped from the ship the
first night by slipping quietly down the
boats side and swimming ashore his
preparations had consisted of penning a
scrawl to will telling that he had gone to
find her

  he landed dripping in the little low-
lying white-housed town where he got food
and dried out before the stingy fire in a
cheap posada here he made inquiries
about the location of the court and learned
that it was now at granada a city some
distance inland and to the northeast

  arthur lake slept that night at this same
inn where he had eaten and the next morn-
ing beneath a brilliant blue sky departed
on foot soon he had left the little town
with its whitewashed houses streaked with
vermillion glistening and gleaming beside
the sunlit sea and entered upon the flat
sandy shadowless country of arid dunes
flies and mosquitoes and pitiless sun

  he spent eight days on his way unex-
citing but happy days often traversing a
hilly dusty country where he frequently
had to ask his way but where the customs
seemed strangely familiar and satisfying
sometimes he had company but more often
he went forward alone his evident prowess
protected him from much his shabby
clothes from more and his beauty and
charmingly simple friendliness brought to
him still more that was very delightful

  the land abounded in surprising con-
trasts hours of heat and dust and bar-
renness would be succeeded by yineyards
and grain-fields-now nearing harvest in
this tropic clime or silvery-green olive-
orchards and orange-groves where the yel-

low balls were still green and the glossy
aromatic foliage sent up a sweet smell in
the golden air would be followed by rocky
sunburnt plains and desolate dry rivers

  as he proceeded the ground became more
and more rolling and the snowy peaks of
the sierra nevada came into view

  on the eighth day his eyes were glad-
dened by the sight of granada backed by
the snow-capped mountains resplendent-
upon its hills while above among the dark
cypresses towered the beautiful ruddy
fortress of the alhambra

  at noon he arrived within this old city
of the moors which they had but recently
surrendered and with little difficulty he
learned the whereabouts of the dwelling-
place of the kings secretary for the
count of sansito had a palace of his own

  arthur went to it but after making cer-
tain that it was the right place he dared
not knock and demand entrance

  instead he walked around it several times
and then went to a posada where he bathed
put on fresh linen which he had bought in
the town with part of the last but four
of his gold pieces and as a final touch of
elegance placed the magnificent jeweled
ring on his forefinger and how it glit-
tered strangely at odds with the strong
well-worn hands of the usual sailor-boy

  thus arrayed he wended his way to the
prisonlike palace of the kings secretary

  he marched up to the door and bravely
grasped the magnificent wrought-iron
knocker he raised it and let it fall with a
loud thud

  he waited in sore anxiety what was
he about to discover or was he about
to discover anything he might be turned
away no matter-he would come again
again and again until he learned the secret
then to find judith and then-

  the door opened a marvelously liv-
eried servant looked insolently at the big
fair-haired sailor

   the count de sansito arthur raised
his deep voice to interrogate

  the servant did- not budge from where
he blocked the entrance

   i would see don juan de seseca
arthur cried imperiously for all that he felt
most insecure


the argosy

  as he spoke he moved his hand in a
brave attempt to wave this lackey aside

  suddenly the servants whole manner
changed he almost groveled as he bowing-
ly besought the shabby youth to come
within

   the count de sansito will see you
instantly

  in the greatest bewilderment arthur
lake entered the tapestry-hung hall the
strange moorish lamps suspended from the
richly ornamented ceiling made little light
when suddenly the glare of the sunny
street was shut out-the iron-studded door
behind him had closed noiselessly

chapter xii

the interview

the magnificent corridor brought him to
a more magnificent loggia that ran
around all four sides of a large courtyard
over this enclosure billowed a gorgeous
tawny-pink canopy in wide stripes of alter-
nate thick and thin silk

  into the mysterious rosy gloom of this
flower-planted court the lackey hastened
and arthur followed the center of the
courtyard toward which they advanced
was occupied by a small marble pool from
which rose a single thin jet of crystalline
water flashing like a keen rapier toward
the silken roof and then returning upon
itself with a sleepy tinkle

  beside the fountain was a richly sculp-
tured bench of green semitransparent stone
upon which lolled a man elegantly dressed
in black velvet with touches of gold he
looked up from watching the water circles
of the fountain

  he was the spanish grandee former pas-
senger of the hopeful

  before arthur could recover from his sur-
prise the servant spoke

   your grace of sansito a messenger
from his majesty the king

  the grandee started to his feet and then
his astonishment overcofning him at sight of
the young englishman he fell back upon
the bench

  as arthur stepping past the lackey came
rapidly forward sansitos hand flew to his

belt a look of dismay came into his eyes
as he realized that he was unarmed

  arthur saw both the movement and the
look in amazement he asked himself
why does this man fear me

  aloud he inquired  are you don juan
de seseca count of sansito

  the spaniard jerked his head in affirma-
tion while with his hand he motioned to
the servant the lackey movfi promptly
backward until he was beyond range of
their voices but still within view

   you come from the king sansito al-
most whispered

   i do not arthur rapped out

   but my servant said-

  arthur interrupted  i was as much sur-
prised by that as you i-

  he got no further for sansito had spied
the ring he sprang upon it and catch-
ing the hand attempted to tear the jewel
from it

  but the brawny sailor was too quick
with little apparent effort he forced the
count back upon the bench and held him
there

   now whats all this whats the mat-
ter he asked

  sansito calmed suddenly  will you be
seated he inquired graciously

  arthur hesitated for a moment and then
sat down

   the ring you wear the count pointed
 is the property of his majesty the king
of aragon

 holy saints above arthur cried  i
found it on the floor of the cobblers room
that sounds probable sansito sar-
castically remarked and then he laughed

  as the young man eyed his mysterious
trinket with growing awe he remarked
simply  its true

   the ring is the property of my master
the king give it to me i will see that
it reaches him i-

  arthur interrupted  i will not give it
to you why should i

  i could take it from you sansito
quietly addressed a dark-red carnation that
he was caressing

 it is not so easy to take things from
me as your grace has just discovered
the spaniard smiled cruelly  my ser-
the great discovery



vants are within call and he trailed the
heavy-scented flower across his thin lips

   they would find it no easy matter to
despoil me i am no weakling

  sansito interposed  my boastful young
man dont you realize that i can do with
you as i choose you are alone in my
palace

  then suddenly he discarded his insolent-
ly threatening manner  i ask you in all
courtesy to give me that ring his words
were like the fountains music

   and in all courtesy arthurs deep
voice declared  i refuse your gentle re-
quests move me no more than your threats
sansito made a sharp movement his
eyes glinted ominously  young man you
may go too far dont you know i could
-kill-you for that matter

  at last the realization of his danger
yawned before arthur he thought quickly
and to good purpose a lie might save
him  if you harmed me what do you
suppose my friends would do

   your friends sansito echoed in alarm
 they know you are here

  arthur smiled and nodded wondering
just who his friends were and why sansito
feared them  i have taken other precau-
tions than this simple one of bringing my
dagger he tapped his side

   what do you want why are you
here the count demanded flatly

   to- the young man interrupted
himself  why did you deceive me on the
hopeful you said you did not know
seseca you yourself are he

  a crooked smile twitched the diplomat-
ists face  i have that honor

   then why did you lie

  the spaniard flushed  your words are
blunt sir sailor

   i am an englishman arthur respond-
ed  my tongue knows no latin tricks

  a slight silence came and then sansito
recited calmly  in that brief interview on
the boat which you cut short you will re-
member you only said you must find
seseca i was in england on a secret and
most perilous mission for his majesty king
ferdinand i feared discovery

   was that why arthur cried in a dazed
way

  sansito quickly took advantage of his
position  i dared make no admission
besides sir thomas merton knew who i
was why did he not tell you-

   sir thomas knew that you were the
seseca for whom i was looking he-
sansito interrupted i do not know
what seseca you are seeking but he cer-
tainly knew that i was juan de seseca
count of sansito

    then you can tell me everything the
youth cried radiantly

   i dont know what you mean by every-
thing the count feigned mystification
 what can i tell you he coldly inquired

   about myself-who i am and what my
secret is- arthur paused

   go on the other prompted

  then impetuously the handsome sailor
told of finding the locket and treasure arid
of his loss of everything except the picture
and a remembrance of the parchment direc-
tions-to find and question seseca

    and this locket the spaniard inquired
quietly  where is it

   as the significant question floated on the
warm air arthur recalled old tobits warn-
ing to be  ticklish  of this man

   it is safe the youth responded enig-
matically

  the count was watching him narrowly
 upon your person he inquired

   arthur did not answer

    i would like to see it

    what for the youth showed suspicion
 if you can tell me everything what good
would it do you to look at this miniature
there is nothing written upon it except
the words-your mother-and on the out-
side for-

   for whom seseca cried

   that is entirely worn away arthur
responded  now i have answered many
questions-you talk

  the handsome face had flushed with
happy anticipation it now paled as sansito
declared  there is nothing i can tell

   why arthurs voice was harsh

    because the count confided  i know
nothing

   incredulously the big sailor burst forth
 know nothing

    exactly


the argosy

   what do you mean

  slowly the spaniard remarked  seseca
is a common name in spain there are
many of us i know nothing about you
my dear young giant except what you your-
self have just confided to me his tone
wras too perfect in its sincerity

  but arthur lake believed him

   these words settled upon him like mighty
stones he had counted upon this inter-
view never suspecting that it might all end
in nothing he seemed to sink dejectedly
in upon himself

  the spaniard watched in silence when
he thought the youths despondency had
reached the proper stage for his evil pur-
pose he asked whats the matter

  arthur looked up  everything i-
he paused

   sansito came to the rescue

   there are other sesecas you must
hunt them out sooner or later you will
succeed in finding your man i am sure
you will you are the kind who does not
fail he flattered

  then the spaniard smiled as he said
 it will take time and money but you are
young

   yes arthur admitted  im young
but money- he shrugged

  many thoughts-questioning miserable
thoughts-whirled about in his confused
brain

  in the silence seseca watched him the
fountain trickled dreamily the flowers gave
out their blessed perfume and the sunlight
forsook the ruddy awning

   finally arthur arose  im intruding
he began  i must beg you to forgive me
and-

  the count of sansito put his hand gen-
tly upon the unhappy man

    stay he solicited  i would talk fur-
ther with you

chapter xiii

the ring and the letter

i e drew arthur down beside him  i
would like to help you sansito said
kindly

  the hand which he had placed upon the

sailors arm still remained there and he
gazed graciously upon his victim

  touched by sesecas evident interest but
remembering the warning arthur forced
himself to demand  why do you wish to
aid me

   why why sansito hesitated

  perhaps its your youth-perhaps-well
-sometimes there is a heart left somewhere
in the depths of even so hardened a courtier
as i the secretary of his majesty the
king of spain is after all just a man
he paused and waited vainly for arthur
to respond

  the fragrant languor of the voluptuous
garden seemed to encompass them more
closely the blue and orange tiles decorat-
ing the facades of the house seemed to
glisten more tenderly and the rosy twilight
of that old moorish courtyard to sanctify
with its security and peace

  sansito was the first to speak

   i can instruct you in the whereabouts
of all the sesecas i know and so send you
forth upon your quest but i wish to do
more i-

   you can arthur cried  tell me of
sir thomas merton and his daughter

   what of them the count parried

   where are they

  sansito lied promptly  they have re-
turned to england

   already

  the count confirmed his lie and con-
tinued gloomily as soon as we left the
ship we hastened to seville where the
court was sir thomas quickly despatched
his business and with his daughter started
at once for home

  when the silence following this was brok-
en it was by the spaniard speaking as if
half asleep your interest sets in the di-
rection of the daughter-yes

  the sailor did not reply and sansito
resumed she is very desirable - that
young lady very beautiful and very
good-

  indeed-yes arthur agreed happily

   it is because of her that you wish to
learn the secret of your birth and regain
your precious gold and-

  arthur sighed deeply and made a sign of
affirmation
the great discovery



   i would i could help you sansito
thought aloud

   another silence followed

   would you take money the secre-
tary barely breathed the words

   arthur asked sharply  from you

   why not-from me the question
was as musical as a song

    i see no reason why i should arthur
spoke stiffly then more gently added i
thank you noble count for the offer
unabashed sansito inquired you be-
lieve in this secret that your parchment
hinted

   his companion nodded

    i think i understand juan de seseca
did not look at the youth his eyes wan-
dered over the beautiful garden and his
voice came slowly and softly

    you feel within yourself that you have
the right to claim your loved ladys hand
the spaniards voice quickened  that in
your veins pulses good true noble blood
something fine stirs within you-you feel
yourself-almost-a king you-

   yes yes arthur cried  that is
just it how did you know-how-
sansito interrupted  it is a way of
youth he smiled benignantly  i too
was young you-you might almost be my
son he added sadly  i have no son
arthur was impressed the schemer saw
his advantage and hastened to his goal by
slowly suggesting  let me give you
money boy it will make your search
easier you need better attire-and-

   the englishman shook his head positive-
ly  thank you my lord thank you-
but no

    then my son let me buy that ring of
you it really belongs to the king of spain
it was stolen from me on my last mission
to england how i know not nor can i
guess how it came to be found by you
in dover it was while i was in london
that i was robbed king ferdinand does
not yet know of the loss give me the ring
it will save me chagrin and you will re-
ceive its full value you need gold-
arthur asked greedily howmuch
the count of sansito clapped his hand
sharply upon the bench the lackey sprang
to attention

    bring me the toledo coffer the master
called

   this coffer a box of marvelous moorish
inlay-gold on steel-was brought san-
sito opened it by a hidden spring and took
out three bags

   it was now that arthur noticed that the
count did not use his left hand and that
both were encased in fine black gloves that
opened down the back after the italian
style

    one bag is for you seseca announced
 one is for you to remember me by and
the third is a momento of mistress judith
he smiled charmingly

    each contains one hundred pieces of
gold-is it a bargain-

   he got no further for arthur jerked the
ring from his hand

    it is yours he cried eagerly

   sansito dropped the jeweled ring into the
casket he closed this strong box with a
sharp snap then indicated that the lackey
who was kneeling with it on his outstretched
arms should take it away

   arthur was profuse in his thanks

    that money is nothing the spaniard
cried  it will get you nowhere with your
beloved and thats what counts-eh

   the youth blushed

  sir thomas is an ambitious man
sansito announced regretfully  there is
talk here in spain of an almost royal match
which he could effect if his daughter so
chose you must get a fortune my friend
and quickly too or better still get fame
now i think of it there may be another
way to help you

   arthur was attentive

   sansito spoke with growing enthusiasm

 there is an italian christopher colum-
bus who is about to sail from palos on an
expedition of discovery the spanish
sovereigns have fitted him out with three
caravels he promises to find lands in the
west

   the count did not add that his had al-
ways been one of the strongest voices raised
in doubts concerning columbuss undertak-
ing instead he assured arthur he will find
that for which he seeks and great fame and
riches too

    you my son know and love the sea


the argosy

sansito spoke appreciatively  who could
be better fitted to serve under this new
 admiral of the ocean seas as he has been
christened by queen isabella-who i ask
you should share in his triumphs

  the nobleman seeing that arthurs inter-
est was kindled hastened to add this offer
to the blaze  i can give you a letter that
will insure your place in this glorious under-
taking

  arthur demanded  mien does he sail

   shortly

   but his crews are already complete

   no doubt they are sansito agreed
 but with my letters you will be given
place

  he did not explain that columbus had
encountered such extreme difficulty in secur-
ing mariners that an extra seaman would be
most welcome an order from king ferdi-
nand forcing men to embark had not been
sufficient so condemned criminals had to
be freed to swell the list of those hopeless
venturers upon the sea of darkness

   and you will do this for me arthur
cried

   indeed yes

  the youth turned and looked searchingly
at the overly enthusiastic nobleman

  sansito pretended not to notice but has-
tened on  when you return as one of a
richly successful voyage of discovery you
will find sir thomas merton more ready
to listen to your prayers and mistress
judith-

  arthur interposed  i will go

   it is well the count remarked and
added subtly  and i pray it will be well
he did not mention to whom the benefit
should come

   now sir voyager i will hasten to pre-
pare the letter and- sanisto hesitated
 shall i send don luis to you with his
assistance you can be properly habited be-
fore you depart-

  you mean you wish to give me better
clothes

   why not those are far from-new
and-

   i thank your grace these will answer
until i buy some for myself in accepting
your letter im obligating myself far more
than is my custom

  the count shrugged  so be it he re-
plied calmly but in his heart was disap-
pointment for he had not discovered the
hiding-place of the miniature he suspected
it to be upon the youths person but he had
observed that no chain encircled the sailors
throat

  arthur was left in the beautiful garden
now ash-color in the fading light

  within a short time sansitp returned
with a document which don luis had writ-
ten but which he himself had signed and
sealed with his arms

  arthur took the missive which bore the
inscription

don cristobal colon

adisinl of tke ocean seal
la the pert  pale

   by the haid of tajlarte de lajet

  he smiled at this grotesque spanish ren-
dition of his own name- tallarte de
lajes  arthur lake little did he sus-
pect that this garbling was deliberate and
a precaution which sansito had taken to
protect himself

  after expressing his heartfelt thanks for
what had been done for him arthur left

  the secretary stood and smiled after him
he had given his word not to harm this
youth and in a way he had kept that word
all the same he had arranged to do away
with him as surely as if he had followed
any one of numerous impulses to have him
murdered for from this western voyage
sansito was firmly convinced no one would
ever return

  but before the sailor left granada that
telltale miniature must be taken from him

chapter xiv

prison

when the young englishman was clear
of the sansito palace he was trailed
through the gathering dusk by don luis
and three of the counts stalwart servants
the great discovery



  before sending the jewish doctor upon
this errand sansito had admonished him
 you are not to take this young mans
life except as a last resort under no circum-
stances are you to permit yourself to be
recognized and guard carefully against
these  friends  of his do you under-
stand

  don luis assured his master that he did
and departed

  in a narrow street behind the cathedral
the lackeys set upon arthur

  they were armed with stout sticks and
had the advantages of number and surprise
however the first assault failed and in
some trepidation don luis watching from
the shadow of a deep doorway saw that
arthur with his back to a blank wall
looked ready for anything and was calling
lustily for help

  the ruffians disconcerted by the amazing
strength of their prey hesitated no one
would venture to attack alone but finally
they decided to rush forward in a body

  arthurs continued cries awakened noth-
ing but echoes in the deserted street the
iron-latticed bird-cage windows projecting
from near-by houses might as well have
been openings into houses of the dead

  as the men came upon him the sailor
sprang forward and caught the nearest fel-
low a stunning blow under the chin the
stricken man gave a gurgling cry staggered
back and falling up against the wall closed
his eyes but arthur narrowly escaped the
descending club of his next companion the
club crashed to the surprised lackeys side
he had been certain of hitting his man

  arthur sprang upon this momentarily
useless club and by sheer weight tore it
from the wielders hand at the same time
before the third knave realized what was
taking place the sailor had drawn his poig-
nard and was upon him he struck two
deep blows over the fellows heart the
unfortunate creature shrieked and fell
headlong into his own blood

  by this time the second man whose blow
the youth had so narrowly escaped was
rearmed he succeeded in striking the
poignard from arthurs hand and at-
tempted to clinch with him but the
sailors feet were not idle he cleverly

tripped this adversary and during the brief
moments that he was down possessed him-
self of the dying lackeys club and gave two
resounding whacks on the struggling brutes
defenseless pate then this second man
rolled senseless into the gutter

  arthurs frequent cries for help seemed
about to be answered noise of people run-
ning was heard

  the remaining lackgy just recovered
from the blow under his chin seeing the
fate of his companions and hearing people
approaching decided to trust to his heels
as he fled another man joined in his flight

  arthur noticed him and wondered who
this could be and then the watch was upon
him

  he attempted to explain his predicament
but these officers of the law recognizing one
of the fallen men as a lackey of the great
secretary would listen to nothing pro-
testing arthur was taken before ah ignorant
petty official and charged with breaking the
peace killing the icings loyal law-abiding
subjects-in broad daylight-in the open
street these last clauses seemed in the
eyes of the official to be his most heinous
offenses

  arthur was allowed to say nothing in
defense but was roughly led away to prison
his letter to columbus and the bags of
gold for which he had sold the ring were
taken from him and he was thrust into a
little dark cell here the hot air stank
with a nauseatingly fetid odor while rats
and worse vermin disputed his possession
of water in a handleless pitcher and a small
hunk of hard bread

  without in the rough guard-room ar-
thurs two jailers gossiped he could hear
their mumblings but not the words they
were cooking their meager supper over a
sickly fire burning upon the hearth-a big
flat stone in the center of the room

   the yellow-head for all his gentle man-
ners killed one of the count de sansitos
own men the big tall bristly hollow-
jawed fellow named tomasso announced
he spoke with gloomy awe as he pointed to
arthurs cell he moved out of the blinding
smoke licking his fingers and munching
then sat down

   i heard it was two his little com-


the argosy

panion sebastian a copper-colored bald
man complained disappointedly

  no-one tomasso corrected noisily
his manner was haughty despite his rags
 the fellow with the broken head will
recover he continued  i know juan
told me he it was that helped carry him
and the dead one to the sansito palace

   the yellow-head had papers upon him
too did you know that sebastian
blinked

  the smoky torch-light flared in the hot
breeze fitfully revealing and obscuring the
dirt and squalor of this prison lounging-
room

   papers tomasso snorted  worse
than that-a letter to the fiend incarnate
the italian magician cristobal colon
who-

   is he a magician as well sebastian
cried in horror  i thought he was but a
madman who sailed other folks ships
and-

  tomasso loudly interrupted  if he
were not a magician how else could he
bewitch our men into sailing with him to
their deaths

   is it to their deaths holy mother
i thought it was to find new land sebas-
tian was in a sad muddle

    you are a heretic and fit for hell s fire
or worse the fires of the holy inquisition
tomasso thundered

   shuz be quiet sebastian pleaded in
terror  say not that god defend me
from the holy office im a true son of the
church

   i have my suspicions tomasso mut-
tered as he luxuriated in his little com-
panions alarm  especially when you say
this pilot can find new lands beyond the
great ocean

   thats what he claims i-

  poor sebastian got no further  you
infidel tomasso cried do you know
that this colon preaches that the earth is
round that folks walk on tother side with
their heads down like flies on a ceiling
that-

  holy saints in god sebastian moaned
he repeatedly crossed himself and began
mumbling a protecting prayer

   do you suppose the yellow-head is like

that he finally ventured to inquire sus-
piciously eying the door of arthurs cell

   like what the fierce-looking tomasso
demanded

   wanting to make us all walk on our
heads like flies

  tomasso spat in disgust  you are a
fool

  sebastian cowered but at last his lo-
quacity overcame his fears and he timidly
remarked  and he looks so gold-pure
and mannered like a prince he might be
born royal as a trastamara you dont
think he might be the poisoned prince
he had yellow hair and-

   now interrupted tomasso  you are
fit for the inquisition and ill declare
against you he got to his feet

  oh st lawrence defend me the
little man prayed  what have i said
theres surely nothing against god in
that-

   worse tomasso pronounced awfully
 you spoke against the holy trinity

   hows that sebastian besought his
austere judge  i did but say-

   know you of what the blessed trinity
is composed

  sebastian looked doubtful

  tomasso informed him  tis god--
hes first and then the blessed king ferdi-
nand and then the thrice blessed queen
isabella now the instructor in dogma
lowered ominously above his companion
when you suggest this fellow is of the
royal line you blaspheme against the
blessed trinity and hence are fit subject
for the holy office

  sebastian was in a sad state  ill re-
cant ill swear to anything i meant no
harm ill-

  his companion emitted a filthy word and
showed him aside fool he cried
 pray god to lead you no more into
temptation

  little sebastian fell upon his knees and
began his prayers beating his breast and
calling aloud upon the divine mercy of ail
the saints in the calendar

  the tall tomasso looked on approvingly
until a brilliant idea came to him then he
interrupted his fellow jailers devotions

   since yellow-head was rich enough to
the great discovery



carry bags erf gold upon him maybe he
might be worth helping to escape he an-
nounced

   the little bald man looked up stupidly

    you go in and talk to him tomasso
 proposed  see what he will give us to
 look aside while he gets out

   you come too sebastian suggested
  he might knife me-alone-in the dark

   how can he knife you without any
knife tomasso was indignant at his com-
panions stupidity besides if we both
go and are caught conniving in this escape
two heads would pay the penalty one is
enough for us to risk what say you-
yes-yes-yes he advanced upon his
thicker-witted companion at each question
insisting upon a response

    yes sebastian hastened to confirm

   tomasso turned away to unlock the door
 of arthurs cell

   sebastian advanced scratching his bald
 head  if i had not you to think for me
 tomasso where would i be he demanded

   the tall jailer did not answer but turned
 away from the unlocked door and stepping
 quickly across the room pretended to be
 interested in something outside the barred
 window

   sebastian understood this trick and
 noiselessly opening the cell door he slipped
 into the dark little hole where arthur not
 daring to sit down stood shoe-deeo in the
 filth

   would you be free sebastian idioti-
 cally queried after he had closed the door
 and heard his accomplice lock it on the
 other side

   these words suggesting a happy promis
 seemed like light breaking through the black
 clouds of arthurs thoughts

  yes-why who are you he in-
quired

  whisper sebastian warned what
would you give

   all i have arthur responded promptly

  the jailer demanded  how much is
that

    four doubloons and some silver

   have you no more sebastian was
greedy although this amount was beyond
the poor underpaid creatures wildest
dreams of wealth

  no was the prisoners gloomy re-
 sponse

  outside you have more eh sebastian
 suggested

 i am a stranger in granada i have
 nothing more

  will you give it to me-all-if i let
 you slip through the guard-room

  and beyond that arthur demanded

  is one sentry you can wait your
 chance and slip by him maybe ill tell
 him not to look

 smiling at the discipline of this prison
 the young englishman cried  its a bar-
 gain already he was extracting his gold
 from its hiding-place

  wait till i ask tomasso if its enough
 sebastian whispered  how much did you
 say

  four doubloons

 sebastian prompted and some silver
 -yes

  yes the young man admitted ruefully
  but i had thought you would let me keep
 that

  what for the jailer was suddenly
 suspicious

  for traveling money arthur an-
 nounced with a wry smile

  you go on a journey sebastian
 showed a gossips quick interest

  yes the youth responded  to the
 south of spain perhaps farther

  oh then you must keep the silver
 sebastian graciously conceded then ap-
 prehensively he added

  but ill ask tomasso

chapter xv

the threat

 hon luis returned to the sansito palace
 humiliated and fearful he had failed
 in a most important mission the fact that
 he usually succeeded would weigh little with
 the count against this present failure

 the jew knew that for years he had
 been allowed to live on in spain and enjoy
 safety only through the good offices of his
 master the inquisitor-general torque-
 mada had just obtained a royal edict for-
 bidding a jew even to hold intercourse with


the argosy

a christian all the race were now obliged
to accept baptism or exile don luis had
long since officially placed himself within
the law but he understood only too well
that his considerable wealth made him
envied and his surgical ability rendered
him a suspicious person for necromancy
and medical science were almost synony-
mous to many sansito alone stood be-
tween him and the torture and how would
he accept the return of his emissary empty-
handed

  the jew was relieved to learn that his
master was away having been summoned
to the presence of his still greater master
king ferdinand indeed the count did not
return until late that night -

  but immediately upon seeing don luis
early the next morning sansito cried
 give it to me quick

  the jew stammered  but i have not
got it

  not got it sansito was astonished
 then he did not have it upon him
suddenly the frightened doctor saw a
chance of escape and hastened to lie  i
searched but it was not on him he killed
our martin and broke diegos head and-
his recital was interrupted by the en-
trance of a bold lackey wtho announced
 the prisoner has escaped the-

   what prisoner the count cried in
angry bewilderment

  don luis went pale but did not speak
the master demanded  what pris-
oner

  the lackey spoke up  the one as killed
martin and almost murdered diego

   that englishman in the clutches of the
law  sansito was thinking of all that
arthur might reveal turning upon the
trembling doctor he demanded sternly
 why did you not tell me this

   i did not know the jew began

  sansito interrupted angrily  you knew
that he had been taken into custody

   yes

   why did you not inform me last
night

  don luis cringed

   answer 

   he has escaped now the jew at-
tempted to mitigate his masters wrath

   escaped sansito derided  yes but
how with whose help what may he
have told what--this must be

  he paused to glare at an intruding
servant

   what do you want sirrah he snarled
the servant stood rigid and announced
solemnly  his most catholic majesty
king ferdinand of aragon commands the
immediate presence of his grace of san-
sito	

  the count looked perturbed his own
position at court was just now most pre-
carious he must respond at once to this
royal command but this other matter was
also most serious

  hurriedly he dismissed the two servants
then catching don luis fiercely by the arm
he cried  go and find this young english-
man it makes no matter where he is
find him i say find him and bring him
here to me go it makes no difference
nothing makes any difference i must have
him here-safe with me

  don luis was about to ask some neces-
sary question but his master thinking that
he was going to make objection concerning
his orders cried fiercely do you know
what happened at court yesterday

  the jew made no response a sickening
fear came upon him

  sansito hastened to recount  two of
the richest members of your race attempt-
ing to avert their doom had presented
enormous sums to his majesty yesterday
while king ferdinand was considering this
offer torquemada himself appeared sud-
denly in the royal presence holding up
a crucifix he cried lo here is the
crucified whom judas sold for thirty pieces
of silver will you sell him again for thirty
thousand

   king ferdinand feebly expostulated

   but the raging inquisitor interposed
passionately  i at any rate will have no
part in the transaction

   he threw down the crucifix and left
the room

   this sansito smiled cruelly  to his
majesty now you see where you stand
white with fear and trembling don luis
looked beseechingly at his master

   go to the prison sansito commanded
the great discovery



 find out everything you can then find
him if you do not bring him here-well
the spaniard extended his open hands with
a graphic gesture  do you understand

    yes

  for a few moments sansito gloated over
the abject misery of his doctor cruelty
shone in the counts eyes and the fire of
fanatical religious zeal seared his heart no
one better than he appreciated that this
cringing creature was a rich and talented
man forced by necessity to call him master

  when the count of sansitos hideous
passion was satiated he turned on his heel
hastening to obey the summons of the king

chapter xvi

sansito entrapped

what can king ferdinand want at
this ungodly hour the secretary
muttered as he dismounted at the gate of
the alhambra he dismissed all but two
of his attendants and walked haughtily past
the saluting guard

  although it was late july the morning
air was chill here on the hilltop and the
count drew his light cloak more closely
about him the beautiful palace was be-
fore him and he was thinking regretfully
how it might have been his if the queen
had not overcome her fear that witchcraft
lurked in its painted stones

   for at first the pious isabella had been
repelled by the regal abode of the van-
quished moors now she had become
reconciled to the heathenish beauty of its
colorful bejeweled halls and in this orien-
tal dream-palace of many courts sculptured
fountains vistaed pools and lovely gardens
the most magnificent sovereigns of christen-
dom held sway

  the count of sansito traversed various
beautiful apartments encountering few ex-
cept the sentinels until he arrived at the
royal antecourt here was the usual crowd
he spoke gravely to some flippantly to
others and ignored the deep bows of still
more

   hastening to the door of the inner room
where their majesties held state he opened
it and entered unannounced exercising a

privilege the ceremonious sovereigns allowed
to few

  at the far end of this beautifully carved
and painted apartment which was further
embellished by rich tapestry hangings sat
the sole occupant of the room-king ferdi-
nand of aragon

   his great chair was upon a slightly raised
platform a long table before him and im-
mediately by his side an empty chair
intended for his wife the queen of castile
over all was draped a magnificent ruby-
velvet canopy which bore the golden arms
of the united kingdoms

  the king was superbly dressed in maroon
and red-brown with slashings of pale blue
he was rather a handsome man and de-
cidedly kingly in appearance his abun-
dant fair hair was bobbed square except
for a curved line that ran from the straight
bangs on the temple to below the ear and
his strong-featured face was beardless

  the cold calculating eyes looked up
sharply at the intrusion but his majesty
spoke very deliberately  you are late i
have waited long

  he pushed the shining straight hair back
from his shrewd somewhat sensual face
and then placing his beautiful hands on
the table gazed proudly upon them

   how can i serve your majesty san-
sito placated

   by telling me why and for what that
old fossil from the barbarian king keeps
annoying me

  the courtier smiled  by which you
mean sir thomas merton envoy from the
king of england

   ferdinand sniffed luxuriously as with sar-
casm he remarked brilliantly guessed
now what does he want tell me that

   as your majesty knows it is about this
marriage of your daughter dona catherine
and the prince-

  ferdinand interrupted its more ive
been pestered for an interview about that
for days but this is something new he
clamored at dawn to-day for immediate
audience

  the secretary filled with vague alarm
cried  have you seen him

   no the king replied and shifted his
velvet-shod feet to another place on the


the argosy

warm wide rim of the great copper and
brass brazier beneath the table at which he
was sitting

   i wanted to speak first with you fer-
dinand drawled  you have always advised
on these english matters more or less to my
satisfaction

  sansito feeling apprehensive of this
smooth beginning smiled and bowed

  the king looked a trifle surprised by this
nervousness of his secretary  what is it
all about he inquired

   i do not know sansito soothed  but
i will soon learn he is without i saw-

  while speaking the count had started
toward the outer door but the king cried
 that will not do i must see the old fool
england must be treated with respect i
have held off perhaps too long but other
things were more pressing-catherine is a
baby still and-- he paused and looked
searchingly at sansito

   there is nothing you can tell me to
illumine my way in this interview his
majesty astutely demanded

  the secretary grew uncomfortable be-
neath the scrutiny of those clear eyes
much was going on in his brain first he
was wondering what the king suspected
and next what ailed the english envoy he
knew that sir thomas had a right to be
impatient he had promised to support
him in this marriage business and had done
what he could but king ferdinand was
slow and cautious after the official recep-
tion of the envoy no progress had been
made

  could it be possible that sir thomas had
learned of the attack upon arthur and
construing this in the light of the kings
indifference decided that the secretary had
played false was the old man about to
reveal everything to king ferdinand no
-no that was impossible sansito vehem-
ently told himself

  but all the same this was very close
to the truth for the trusty tanner dis-
covering about the fight had reported to
his master the account of this cowardly
onslaught had roused the ire of the old
englishman to a great heat his sense of
justice was so outraged that he forgot all
diplomacy the necessity for immediately

employing every possible means to preserve
arthur had urged him to apply at the kings
door at dawn

  a change in regard to the young sailor
had been growing upon sir thomas these
last weeks after closely observing judith
and talking repeatedly and earnestly with
her he had been forced to understand that
his daughters future happiness was irre-
vocably intertwined with the life of arthur
lake

  as the count of sansito remained pen-
sively unresponsive the icy voice of king
ferdinand broke through the troubled si-
lence call in the english envoy he
commanded

   i will talk with him first the count
announced with dignified assurance  i
might save your majesty-

  he got no further  do as you are bid
the royal master snapped within a few
minutes sir thomas merton entered the
chamber

  without acknowledging the bow of san-
sito whose presence at this interview both
surprised and annoyed him the old english-
man almost ran to king ferdinand and
threw himself on his knees before the
sovereign

  when commanded to arise sir thomas
cried  i come to your majesty as a sup-
pliant in the name of justice and humanity

i-

   what have you to say old man rise
and speak ferdinand was as usual cour-
teous cold observant and superlatively
regal

   last night sir thomas began as he
arose  a young man was set upon by
servants of his he pointed angrily at
the secretary

  the king did not even look interested
although he had noted that sansito changed
color

  their intent was murderous sir
thomas announced witheringly  the
youth routed them-god be thanked but
he is now in prison i pray your majesty
to protect him

  the king did not reply but looked in-
quiringly at sansito who also remained
silent although a cruel smile threatesed t
appear upon his face
the great discovery



  the count was overjoyed to learn that
sir thomas did not know of arthurs
escape hence had probably had no hand
in it

  he was thinking there is no one then
to deal with but the sailor himself and
don luis will soon overtake him and once
again in my power the trouble-maker shall
cease to cause anxiety

  the old englishman ran on  and all
this in spite of the fact that he -again
he pointed his shaking finger at the count-
 he had promised me faithfully not to
harm him

   and who is this sorely pressed youth
ferdinand sneered

   one whom i thought to be english but
who now i have reason to suspect is un-
comfortably close to the spanish royal
house sir thomas responded with angry
dignity

   meaning by that just what the kings
tone was unbelievably insolent

sir thomas was angry and lost his head
 it is just possible he cried  that he
is the son of that prince of viana who was
the older half-brother of your majesty
ferdinand announced wearily  my
brother of viana was never married

   that your majesty i must deny sir
thomas spoke more gently he was still
angry but also he was beginning to appre-
ciate that he had gone too far and was
looking for an opportunity to retreat  i
was present at the wedding he added half
apologetically 

   when was this the king demanded

   just before king john ii of aragon-
his and your majestys father-imprisoned
the prince for the last time

  at first ferdinand did not speak when
he did it was to query  and the wife
was eleanor of durham a young en-
glish girl who had previously forsaken home
and family for love of him

   and this eleanor of durham i suppose
was a close relation of yours the king
inquired meaningly

   no sir thomas drew himself up
haughtily  she was the only child of the
english ambassador to the court of naples
after the fathers death she and her old
mother lived on in the same city it was
 argosy

there she saw and loved don charles of
viana for that unhappy prince found it
expedient to live in italy-

  ferdinand interrupted to ask  what
do you mean by expedient

  sir thomas attempted diplomacy
 king john his father he began  felt
the kingdom of navarre more easy to gov-
ern with his son to whom it was said to
belong living in distant naples

  the king narrowed his eyes as he cried
angrily  and i suppose next you will
tell me that my father abetted by my dear
mother had the prince of viana my half-
brother poisoned while in prison so that the
crown should come to me the younger but
more favored-eh

  sir thomas merton understood that he
was treading on the edge of his own grave
but he did not show the least fear he knew
that to quail before ferdinand now would
mean immediate disaster he spoke braz-
enly

    i had no intention of repeating that old
and terrible tale although i have heard it
more than once and there are those greater
than i who do believe it

  before this attack the king quickly re-
gained his usual calm he spoke slowly
weighing each word  and you say there
is a son of this prince of viana

   no your majesty sir thomas inter-
posed  i did not say there was a son-
although this youth is so like eleanor of
durham that it is surprising i did not sus-
pect it before-

  you have known him long the king
pursued

   he grew up in dover sir thomas ex-
plained  but i knew nothing of his pre-
tentions until just before i sailed this time
for spain i at once told the count of san-
sito what i suspected and he swore me to
secrecy-

   where was this the suspicious mon-
arch was now hot on a scent

  in dover last month sir thomas
announced as he did so sansito who had
been tortured by this interview which he
dared not interrupt darted toward the eng-
lishman a look of undying hatred

   in dover king ferdinand yawned
 i dont seem to remember this english trip


the argosy

of yours to dover i was told my secretary
was in portugal explain he snapped at
the count

chapter xvii

revenge

oansito came forward in silence and
stood before the king he seemed to
be attempting to usurp the very spot occu-
pied by the old englishman

   your majesty he began  i am being
forced into an ugly comer

  sir thomas would like to have inter-
rupted to say  you are about to force me
off my feet but he dared not

   you recall the beautiful jewelled ring
that was mysteriously stolen from you some
weeks agothe count asked

  king ferdinand narrowed his thick lips
and slightly inclined his head

   that ring sansito resumed  i deter-
mined to regain for your majesty because
when you took it from your finger that last
time i was the only person you could re-
member as being present had i been-well
-other than myself-i should certainly
have been accused of theft

  the king tapped the table with the pol-
ished nails of his forefingers this recital
evidently bored him and he made no effort
to disguise the fact

  undismayed the secretary continued  i
asked for leave urging portugal and my es-
tates there as an excuse i did go to por-
tugal then a clue led me to dover where
i encountered sir thomas about to sail on
the same vessel with me he spoke of this
supposed son of the prince of viana i im-
mediately discovered that there were no
adequate proofs upon which to base the fel-
lows pretentions however i besought sir
thomas merton to forget the whole matter
and never to speak of it again to any one i
even agreed to repay his discretion by aiding
his suit to your majesty that suit is the
urging of the spanish-english marriage
sansito darted a swift venomous look at
the old diplomat

  a scowl of displeasure was settling upon
the kings face but he refrained from inter-
rupting

   i also promised sir thomas to make no
attempt to put this youth out of the world

a silly promise i will admit

  sansito paused awaiting some response
from the king but only a calm bored look
met his inquiring gaze and he was obliged
to continue

   the boy is a common sailor he ac-
companied us on our return voyage the
daughter of sir thomass-your majesty
was pleased to comment upon her beauty
yesterday when you passed her in the com-
pany with dona de torres-was on the
same vessel the sailor has his eyes upon
her sansitos look was insinuating

  sir thomas made an angry movement but
dared not interrupt

  the count drew himself up proudly as he
began his final revelation

   yesterday he began slowly  this
sailor called upon me he offered to sell
me the ring-

  ferdinand interrupted  what my
ring

   the same and-

   where had he gotten it the king de-
manded

   i am coming to that your majesty
sansito propitiated  i bought the ring

   why why did you bargain with-
king ferdinand did not finish

  to cover the awkward pause the count
quickly cried  i will reveal all that in
time i beseech your majestys patience

   proceed at your own pace ferdinand
decreed

   i was not ready to accuse this youth of
treason the secretary explained  i was
not ready to reveal the deep plot upon which
i chanced to stumble i am not now
he looked reproachfully at the king  i
would feign have had more proofs but
my hand was forced by this gentleman
he glared at sir thomas merton

   proceed 

   for a large sum i bought the ring i
have it here sansito opened his embroid-
ered pouch but did not immediately display
the jewel

   my lackeys saw the considerable
amount of gold pass to the sailor it proved
too much for their cupidity they followed 
and set upon the youth intending to rob
the great discovery



him he killed one and wounded the other
but was himself taken in charge by the
watch and imprisoned

  sansito drew forth the jewelled ring and
was about to pass it to the king

 your majesty is unaware the secre-
tary began  that this ring was originally
the property of the last prince of viana-
 no ferdinand corrected  the jewel
was my fathers he gave it to me

   pardon your majesty sansito inter-
posed  your father first received the ring
as a gift from his son-the prince of viana
at the time when he liberated and conferred
upon the prince the title of lieutenant of
the realm

  sir thomas peered at the jewel which
sansito had placed upon the table

   that ring was the property of charles
of viana he corroborated

  king ferdinand crossed himself and
gazed with aversion at the one-time treas-
ured trinket

    i will never touch it again he declared

    i think your majesty can see everything
now  however the count hastened to ex-
plain  that ring was stolen for one who
gave it to the pretended son of its original
owner-such possession strengthened the
youths claims--you see and the one for
whom it was stolen is he who aspired to
have his daughter called  princess of viana
-queen of navarre-queen of aragon 
 good god  sir thomas gasped and
raised his old hands to his turbid brain

 but why did the pretender sell the ring
to you sansito king ferdinands cold
suspicious voicetirojietne pstesionate silence
the count was ready for the question

   because he responded  the youth is
not the ambitious one of the conspiracy
he was temporarily separated from the di-
rector of the enterprise he wanted money
and i offered a goodly sum the fellow did
not understand the full significance of the
ring everything is not always explained to
ones tools again that poisonous look
was darted at the old englishman

   sir thomas merton king ferdinand
drawled  until this most serious matter is
properly investigated i must ask that you
take the utmost care of yourself the air
outside the alhambra i am sure would not

agree with either your health or that of your
fair daughter

  suddenly the old diplomat was aroused
to action  surely you do not believe this
pack of lies you cannot i do not see
my way-all is a haze of deceptions and
diabolic tamperings with the truth i must
think-

    exactly the king interrupted  that is
just what i wish you to do i suspect noth-
ing sir thomas the envoy of england is
above conspiring against the crown of
spain i only ask that you be cautious
until the matter is thoroughly sifted i am
certain that -with your valuable assistance
all can be unraveled

   now will you leave us i have much
to discuss with my secretary and remem-
ber the walls of the alhambra are a sure de-
fense for you against everything avail
yourself of their security-remain within
there was nothing for the old man to do
but withdraw he did so in angry bewild-
erment knowing full well that all king fer-
dinands courtesy meant nothing he and
judith were as much prisoners as if they
were in the deepest dungeons of the king-
dom

  the moment they were alone the king
demanded of sansito-  how long have you
known that there was a possible heir to
charles of viana

   not until i discovered it from the lips
of sir thomas merton at dover last
month sansito lied convincingly

   what does this boy know-what proofs
has he-do you believe his tale

  tiour majesty overwhelms me the
count cried  the last question needs no
answer i believe nothing that would in any
way harm you but there is no test put
upon my loyalty in this case the boy knows
nothing has no tale to tell he possesses
a miniature of eleanor of durham upon
which is scratched  your mother he found
this locket upon the neck of his dead father
a cobbler of dover sir thomas merton has
dene the rest-

ferdinand interrupted him you are
strangely revengeful upon that old man
take care or you will make me suspect that
there is something yet to be revealed
sansito bowed low to hide his chagrin


the argosy

 the king remarked  you say this youth
is imprisoned i would see him-have him
brought-

   your majesty the count began timid-
ly  he has escaped

   escaped

  yes the secretary nodded desperately
 sir thomas does not know this i did
not until just as i wras summoned to appear
before you

   he is at large the kings voice
showed genuine feeling

   yes your majesty but i have already
taken precautions he will be found i
have sent one to search-

   sent one-send ten-send twenty the
king cried  no-send no more arouse
no alarm go yourself immediately re-
port to me to-night

  the secretary started toward the door

   here - take this keep it it is
yours the king pointed to the beautiful
ring of the some time prince of viana

  sansito hastened back to accept the gift
 i thank your majesty the count cried

  ferdinand responded  and i trust
you

  the count of sansito smiled delightedly
he felt himself secure in his lords good
graces and departed in high spirits little
dreaming that the wily king was having him
followed by a spy

chapter xviii

illness

the kings secretary returned to his
own palace it was near noon and
the weather by one of those violent changes
characteristic of spain had become almost
tropic worn by the anxieties of the
morning he felt ill and dared not venture
again into the hot sun

  dejectedly he thought of the kings dis-
covery of the existence of arthur lake
his majestys determination to interview the
youth was very alarming arthur would
surely speak of the lost parchment and then
would ensue the fatal revelation of the
name  seseca and spain contained no
other of that name beside himself

  arthurs recital of his discovery of the

hidden gold its robbery and the mysterious
stranger would be of little consequence
 but the severed finger  sansito moaned
with apprehension

  his majesty had long since discovered the
mutilated condition of his secretarys hand
seseca had explained that it was the result
of blood-poison and that his doctor had de
creed the amputation

  but king ferdinand was astute he
would put all the evidence together and ar-
rive somewhere near the truth

   no the king must not see arthur
lake the secretary murmured but
also i must conduct myself with the utmost
circumspection all will be saved if don
luis discovers the sailor and apprehends
him

  but the da wore on and still the jew
did not return and the unhappy count wor-
ried more and more

  in the cool of the afternoon although
feeling very ill sansito sallied forth in
search of news and was trailed by the kings
spy but he did not suspect it

  the count discovered nothing of conse-
quence but several times he heard of don
luiss activities in the same quarters

   i have trained him well the master
commented to himself  he is proceeding
in this investigation as i myself would do
but i want results i hope he has already
finished his man or at least brought him a
prisoner to the palace

  hopefully the secretary returned home
but don luis was not there anger fear
and disappointment struggled for mastery
but outwardly there was no evidence of the
mental conflict until suddenly a fit of diz-
ziness overcame sansito and he staggered
blindly into the beautiful rosy courtyard
there he was seized by violent attacks of
vomiting and was led away to bed after
a time in the cool of his monastically bare
bedchamberhe felt better and set himself
to think over his situation

  after all would he be so pleased if arthur
lake were destroyed he had the proofs
that this youth was the royal heir and in
case anything went wrong with the present
regime and arthur still lived here was the
new king

  it is due sansito to say that never did the
the great discovery



prospect of si at personal advantage accru-
ing to the one who places a monarch on his
throne influence his actions he loved
spain and her interests far more than he did
himself

   it was to insure a ruler for his dear coun-
try that he had aided old tobit then a
young retainer faithful unto death to elea-
nor of durham to escape with the baby
prince this he had done immediately upon
discovering that the inhuman grandfather
was planning to destroy both parents

   as long as the old grandfather lived san-
sito had preserved the helpless little heir
and when ferdinand came to the throne
still he had preserved the young hope while
he watched and waited to see how fair and
just to spain this new monarch would be
and the king of aragon had ruled better
and more wisely than any prince that the
peninsula had even had

   sansito then seeing useless danger in the
existence of the little prince whose dead
father had been the peoples hero decided
upon the secret trip to dover where lie ex-
pected to buy tobits silence and all the
proofs of the youths identity

   to establish himself in the old servants
eyes he had taken the dead prince of
vianas ring it was a token agreed upon
when the baby was spirited away for little
could any one have foreseen that this jewel
would become a valued possession of the old
king who had poisoned its owner but king
john had always refused to part with the
ring and had ultimately left it to ferdi-
nand after deciding to go to dover san-
sito had to wait for months vainly seeking
an opportunity to steal this ring king fer-
dinand was as tenacious of it as his father
had been and the jewel always adorned his
hand finally the count had secured it
and then hastily departed supposedly for
portugal really for dover

  never had he calculated upon the stub-
born refusal of tobit to be a party to the
obliterating of the princes identity

    if he hadnt angered me sansito mut-
tered  i should never have murdered the
old fellow and then all these other events
would not have come crowding upon me-
so fast-so fast that i cannot think what
am i to do what will happen next

  the sick man tossed helplessly a cold
sweat broke out upon him

   if ferdinand discovered that for years
i fostered this son of charles of viana
sansito shuddered  but can he ever dis-
cover this

  the power to reason was slipping from
his fevered brain flis head seemed to ex-
pand and contract with painful persistence
the count moaned aloud and the blackness
that had seemed to be creeping upon him
now engulfed him and juan de seseca sank
into a stupor

  the night passed and from daybreak on
the sick man grew steadily worse his doc-
tor did not return and the servants became
panic-stricken in vain they tried to get
another doctor but physicians were very
scarce for the two races moors and jews
representing almost the entire medical skill
of the day were being expelled in droves
from the kingdom

  news of the secretarys illness was taken
to the palace and king ferdinand seemed
as deeply concerned as he ever was by an-
others affairs and learning that sansito
was without medical care he sent his own
doctor

  this man of science returned to his mas-
ter with the report that in his estimation
the count of sansito would never recover

 six days passed and the patients condi-
tion continued desperate but on the seventh
day he showed signs of mending

  all this time nothing had been heard of
don luis levy and the reason was that
the jew had made no effort to return
indeed he had made every endeavor to dis-
guise his whereabouts from the sansito
household

  on the morning that his master had been
summoned to the interview with the king
and sir thomas merton don luis had gone
to visit the prison as instructed by the
count he had discovered nothing from the
jailors except that arthur in what seemed
to be a miraculous fashion had escaped
through locked doors

  don luis was presented with the confis-
cated letter addressed to columbus but no
mention was made of the three bags of gold

   the little doctor had departed in despair
and spent the remainer of the day in fren-


the argosy

zied efforts to find some trace of the fugitive
his search was vain

  in the late afternoon the jews terror
somewhat subsided or rather he was
calmed by the prospect of immediately put-
ting into action a plan which he had con-
ceived

  it was a desperate chance he was about to
take but the case was worse than desperate

  he procured a mule and quitted granada
taking the road to the west

  on this road arthur lake afoot had pre-
ceded him by some twelve hours

  don luis passed him on the second night
at loja where the almost penniless sailor
was sleeping in the open field but neither
suspected the presence of the other and
don luis continued his journey

chapter xix

tallarte de lajes

por several days following this arthurs
way led along the same road he had
traversed on his journey to granada but
now he was obliged to go more slowly
stopping from time to time to labor for
necessary food

  the enthusiastic expositions of sansito
concerning the glory to be won by adventur-
ing with columbus had deeply impressed
the young sailor there was nothing now
to hold him in spain judith had left so he
had determined to attempt even without an
introduction to join the admiral

  he arrived at palos late in the afternoon
of the second day of august and hastened
through the little town to the bar of saltes
where the three vessels comprising the fleet
of columbus were anchored

  with some difficulty the penniless eng-
lishman got some one to row him out to
the flag-ship and with not oversanguine
hopes the young sailor presented himself to
an officer aboard the santa maria and blus-
teringly demanded speech with the admiral

  the supercilious individual to whom he
addressed this request said that such a thing
was impossible columbus was far too busy
 he sails for the unknown to-morrow an
hour before dawn

  arthur was overjoyed to have arrived in

time  i did not allow myself much mar-
gin did i he remarked laughing

  the officer made no comment and ar-
thur feeling that he must propitiate this
person continued affably  but im lucky
to be here at all and i must speak with
the admiral

   you can not

   but i must arthur persisted

  the officer sniffed and walked away

  arthur followed him and boldly ven-
tured tell don cristobal that i come
from the count of sansito secretary to his
majesty king ferdinand

  the haughty officer looked surprised but
went to deliver this message and arthur
lake waited wondering if he had been a
fool to send such an announcement-he a
fugitive from justice-a beggar ragged and
stained from a long tramp across spain

  it was a daring thing to demand an au-
dience with a great navigator on the busy
eve of his departure upon the greatest voy-
age man had ever conceived a daring
thing to do even if ones credentials were all
right and arthur had no credentials

  the officer returned and bade this ragged
sailor follow him

  radiantly arthur entered the captains
cabin and was ushered into the presence of
christopher columbus

  the great man sat silent before his table
on which were many charts nautical instru-
ments and piles of papers closely written
he was not a large man his white bushy
hair that had long since receded from
his noble brow and his heavily seamed
weather-beaten face declared him to be past
mid-life but arthur felt that he had never
approached any one so alive it was as
though a tremendous fire of energy burned
within the man vivifying the air about him

  his great eyes of italian softness turned
inpiringly upon the visitor but arthur
could not speak this man eloquent in his
silence disconcerted him

  columbuss eyes keen for all their soft-
ness noted how ill this youths costume be-
fitted the emissary of a great noble but
such discrepancy did not arouse any doubts
he had himself served princes and worn
rags of necessity at the same time the
world was a strange place


the great discovery



  he rather liked this youth because of his
garments-they reminded him of himself
if only he had not come from the expedi-
tions arch enemy-sansito

  the admiral suddenly appreciated that he
must be on his guard no matter how much
his instinct declared in favor of this young
man	

   what is your business the genoese
finally asked

   i must go with you on this great
voyage arthur cried he spoke eagerly
and words flowed eloquently from him al-
most without his knowing what he said he
realized that by his prayful rhapsody he
must work a miracle columbus must see
how determined he was to be a part of this
glorious adventure and must even at this
last minute add another to his crew

  first his listener regarded him with sur-
prise then for a moment with quick sus-
picion for the admiral had the true italian
fear of being laughed at but the youths
enthusiasm was too sincere to be doubted
and upon the stern face of columbus settled
an expression of amused interest

  he was recalling how he had despairingly
sought to gain his fellow-voyagers-how it
had been a triumph after hours of persua-
sion to win a reluctant  yes  from some
hard-pressed sailor-and here was a splen-
did seaman begging to be taken

  the admiral smiled with admiration
and pleasure and then across his happy
thoughts came a memory of the narrow
conceited self-satisfied sansito who had
opposed him at every turn with the crafty
conservatism of fanatical bigotry and iron-
clad ignorance

  columbus interrupted the youth  why
is your master so desirous of having you go
along there are surely spies enough with
me-the cautious groom of the kings cham-
ber jealously and coldly overlooking my
every move and always striving to curb me
sansito already has sent one-last week i
took him hes a good surgeon and ill
take you if you are willing to do a seamans
work-

  s willing and able too arthur cried
 i have sailed the sea before

   i have many that have not columbus

to be continu

rejoined bitterly  but are you not afraid
the admiral seemed incredulous

   i am not arthur declared stoutly

  there ensued a short silence broken by
the older man  are you a good catholic
columbuss concern was genuine

   i try to be arthur responded

   then get you into town and confess and
receive the blessed sacrament i take none
with me declared the pious admiral  but
those lately shrived by hy church

   i will enter you on the lists columbus
decreed  and keep you on this ship and
he added acidly  you can then watch me
better-

   i am no spy the young sailor cried
 i but used the name of the count of- san
si to to gain your presence it was refused
me at first

   i ask no questions the admiral spoke
haughtily  i take you no matter whose
man you are return before midnight
and your name the italian opened his
record book

   arthur lake the youth replied

   an englishman

   yes

  columbus was surprised and his suspi-
cions were being quieted but he paused
quill in hand and remarked conversation-
ally  sansitos man was styled  tallarte
de lajes -do you know him he brought
letters of recommendation

   that letter was mine  arthur cried in-
dignantly  it was taken from me and-

  columbus looked narrowly at his new
sailor a letter from the count of san-
sito he asked quietly

   yes

  so the admiral exclaimed sadly
 you do come from his grace i feared as
much

   where is this man he is an impostor
i must find him arthur lake was ex-
cited

   calm yourself my youth the admiral
spoke sternly  i will have no quarrels or
fights on the eve of my departure-i take
you both so what matter go now
and be shriven he motioned toward the
door and returned to his study of the
strange-looking chart

 samuel gcamp

its a sure-enough fact we won it-the
big series-and now theyre all calling
me names like the  miracle man and
the  napoleon of baseball and the like
and i guess if i didnt have a pretty level
head in a way and if it wasnt for
 spike  mcginnis id begin to think i
was somebody as it is-you know theres
a saying that no man is a hero to his valet
well i dont know about that i never
had one but ill say this ive got spike
mcginnis and no doubt in this instance it
amounts to about the same thing i mean
that if im a hero youve surely got to show
spike

  as for me of course im not going round
doing a lot of ballyhooing for myself but
just the same when forced to it im will-
ing to admit that when a fellow cops the
championship of everywhere his first sea-
son as a big-league manager its quite a
little stunt-its stepping some and so no
doubt its a good thing for me that ive
got spike mcginnis handy instead of one
of these valet things because otherwise i
might start swelling up and theres no tell-
ing where it would end

  you understand a valet would probably
keep his opinions to himself if he valued
his job but spike doesnt make any bones
about telling me right to my face what he
thinks of me

  and then too that aint the worst of
it if i didnt handle him with gloves hed
tell the world and if spike mcginnis
ever starts in advertising what he knows-

to say the least ill have to do a lot of ex-
plaining

  anyway according to spike mcginnis
if im the napoleon of baseball-oh boy
-he can sing better than caruso trim
hoppe at billiards and show this chap
rickenbacker how to fly and as for the
miracle man stuff-  a healthy looking
miracle man you are dont make me
laugh says spike but spike doesnt
stop there he doesnt ring off when he gets
through telling me what im not oh no
he goes right ahead and audibly tells me
what i am

   you says he  a lucky stiff thats
what you are a lucky stiff-and thats
all

  so thats the way it is the papers are
all calling me a miracle man and so forth
and spike mcginnis says-but you know
what spike says and ina-the wife you
know-ina admits that ive certainly gone
and done something-and takes most of
the credit to herself and as for me-well
of course it wouldnt look right for a fellow
in my position to do a whole lot of talking
and so i guess youll have to write your
own ticket

  now as a matter of fact this is not the
story of how i-we-won the worlds
championship i-we-won it and the
facts speak for themselves its the story
of how i got my start as a big-league man-
ager the whole thing hinges on that-
how i got my start and the things that
led up to it go back to some little time ago

 
he who hesitates is bossed



   the blow fell shortly after ina and i
were married it was a lucky thing for
ina that i didnt know it was going to hap-
pen if id known it i wouldnt a dared
take the chance you see but i thought
my future was assured for quite a few
years anyway and so i went ahead and
married her and then - of course you
might know - the crash came the old
salary-wing went dead on me about fif-
teen specialists all said the same thing-
and nicked me for a young fortune for say-
ing it id never be any good any more
id pitched my last game of baseball

   and me just married

   but ive got to hand it to dave mcbur-
ney mcbumey was manager of the pink
sox thenand he certainly treated me white
at that when youve given a team the best
thats in you for seven years no doubt
youve got something coming anyway i
stayed with the club

   it was ina that put the bee in my bon-
net-the managership bee of course wed
been doing a lot of worrying about where
we were going from here-and somehow i
couldnt make up my mind what to do all
i knew was that it was certainly a tough
old world and that the future surely looked
black-blacker than jack johnson

  then we heard that mcbumey was go-
ing to quit the club at the end of the sea-
son-and ina was off to a good start she
said that i knew as much baseball as the
best of em and that i had all the neces-
sary qualifications for a first-class manager
and it was up to me to take my foot in my
hand and whirl in and land that manager
job well i agreed with her-partly
when it came to knowledge of the old pas-
time i wouldnt concede an inch to any-
body but-well to tell the truth i didnt
know theres a lot of things that a fel-
lows got to have to make a good baseball
manager and i wasnt sure that i had em
and even if i did have em i wasnt sure
that i wanted the job of managing the
pink sox-provided i could get it look-
ing at it some ways i thought maybe id
like the job and then again looking at it
other ways i thought maybe i wouldnt
i wasnt sure and i couldnt seem to
make up my mind

  but i might just as well a saved my-
self a lot of wear and tear on the old brain
about whether to try for that manager job
or not because ina was strong for it in the
first place and she kept getting stronger
for it right along and so in the end of
course that settled it a little while after
the close of that season i went to the mag-
nate-alonzo j brown owner of the club
you understand-and spoke my little piece

  i told him id heard that mcbumey
was quitting and so of course hed be look-
ing for another manager and if it was all
the same to him id like the job and be-
lieve me id positively guarantee satisfac-
tion-you understand ina had told me to
make it strong and i told him how he
knew id been giving the team the very
best i had for seven years and-and well
how about it

  well alonzo seemed to have some kind
of throat trouble that morning because
anyway he had to clear it several times
before he was able to speak-and then he
asked me to have a cigar while i was
lighting it something in the street seemed
to attract his attention and he spent a
minute or two on the inside looking out-
saying nothing then he went to his desk
and sat down and

    listen jim says he  its like this
the club owes you something-i admit that
-and im not the sort of man to side-step
a debt of that kind but about giving you
the managership-well frankly i cant
say not at this time anyway but get
this dont you worry youve got it com-
ing and ill see that youre taken care of
and thats the best i can say now

  and thats all the satisfaction i got
alonzo j brown threw the whote thing up
in the air and left it there-except of
course that i knew now that i was going
to be taken care of as the magnate said
and that helped some

  when i told ina what alonzo had said
she was dead sure that lwas going to land
the job i told her not to go and get her
hopes set too high because if she did she
was liable to be disappointed but of
course what i said didnt make any differ-
ence she went right ahead seeing me as
manager of the pink sox and all covered


the argosy

with bells and everything and so when we
got the news ill say the wife was a mighty
sore woman-and for that matter i didnt
go rushing round the streets giving any
three long cheers for everybody and every-
thing myself but compared to the wife
i was a happy man she surely took it
hard

  the first we knew about it was when we
read it in the papers the well-known base-
ball magnate alonzo j brown announced
that george a simmons who had been
managing a team in the international
would pilot the pink sox the coming sea-
son and mr brown also announced that
jim vanxess the veteran pink sox south-
paw would be the clubs official coach
working with the young pitchers and so
on

  official coach and he hadnt even asked
me if id accept the position well no
doubt he wanted to save himself the trou-
ble of handing me a lot of alibis for mak-
ing this fellow george a simmons man-
ager and throwing me down and he knew
id accept the position anyway what
else could i do and so that was what
alonzo meant when he said id be taken
care of hed had that official coach thing
up his sleev all the time he hadnt con-
sidered me for the manager job for one lit-
tle minute well at that i guessed i
didnt have any kick coming suppose id
been let out entirely

  thats the way i looked at it but ina
-but ive told you how it struck her

  simmons she hissed who is he
anyway did you ever hear of him jim

   i never did i says  hes one on
me

   then will you tell me why she de-
manded  will you tell me why mr brown
throws down a man like you and goes to
work and gives the job to somebody no-
body ever heard of-a bush-leaguer like
this man simmons

  ina can talk quite a little baseball talk
herself

   you can search me i says  but
there must be something or-

   yes snapped ina  there must be
something-and im going to find out what
it is

  this was shortly after the first of the
year and it wasnt until the last of july
that ina found out what it was-the rea-
son why i had been turned down and
though i didnt know what the reason was
myself its a kind of curious thing but its
the truth she got the answer from me

  you know the wife and i own our own
bungalow well one morning ina says to
me

   well jim have you made up your
mind about the new heating system

  the old heater was pretty well burned
out and we were going to put in a new one
of some kind

   no i says  i havent some ways
steam looks best to me and then again
theres a lot of pretty good arguments for
hot air then theres this one-pipe sys-
tem too and-well i cant seem to quite
make up my mind

   well says ina  i wish youd hurry
up and decide one way or another pretty
soon the fall rush  come on and the
plumbers will all be busy and we may
have to go through the winter with the old
one-and you know it uses twice too much
coal

   yes i says  i know ill see if i
cant make a decision one way or another
pretty soon

   i wish you would says the wife
and how about the car are you going
to sell it and buy a new one like you were
talking of the other day or-what

   i havent made up my mind i says
 the old boats in pretty good shape yet
and what with prices the way they are
nowadays-well i dont know sometimes
i think i will and then i think i wont
ill see

   well says ina  youd better not
take too much time about it if you wait
too long it  fee coming along winter and
you wont be able to get anywhere near
what the car is worth and listen jim
did you order that new suit of clothes
like i asked you to

   no says i  i didnt you see i
cant make up my mind whether to get a
blue serge or one of these palm beach out-
fits the palm beach things are fine for
hot weather but id probably get more ser-
he who hesitates is bossed



vice out of a blue serge suit and so-well
i dont know i cant seem to quite make
up my-

     help  says ina and left the room as
 if she was out of patience or something
 about something or other

    she came back in about ten minutes

     oh says she  you still here jim
 i thought youd gone

     it looks kind of like rain i says  i
  was trying to make up my mind whether
  to take an umbrella or not

   when i got back from the ball game
 that afternoon ina necked me the minute
 i stuck my head inside the door and told
 me to sit down and listen to her-we were
 going to have a little talk

     whats the idea i asked

     this says she  listen jim ive
 got it

     you dont mean the flu says i

    the reason why mr brown turned
 you down for manager of the pink sox
 says she

   you dont tell me i says what
 was the reason

     yourself she says

    me says i  how do you mean
 me

     i mean this she says  listen jim
 you take too long about making up your
 mind about things youre always too-
 uncertain you never can quite make up
 your mind about anything big things or
 little things it never makes any difference
 -youve always got to think it over
 youll  see youll have to have time to
  consider it and you keep right on  con-
 sidering it  until honestly jim sometimes
 it would drive a person crazy

    and so thats the reason mr brown
 turned you down says she  hes known
 you for a long time jim and what i say is
 true-and he cant help knowing it thats
 your trouble jim you cant make up
 your mind and thats the reason george
 simmons is manager of the pink sox in-
 stead of you you always hesitate jim-
 and he who hesitates is bossed

    i asked her where she got that line about
 he who hesitates it didnt sound quite like
 ina

     read that says she id been won-

 dering if there was something in that mag-
 azine that she was going to spring on me
 because she was holding it in her hand
 when i came in and had kept hanging
 right onto it as if she was waiting for the
 proper time to pull the sensation-or what-
 ever it was

  it turned out to be a full-page ad about
a book it was a book written by a fellow
by the name of professor aloysius x bee-
croft and the name of it was  i will i
thought it was a pretty good title it sound-
ed so sort of determined like and every-
thing the ad started off in big type like
this he who hesitates is bossed-
and so that was where ina got it from
then it went on to tell you to  increase
your will-power stop putting things
off learn how to do it now stop
hesitating learn how to be firm de-
cisive determined stop arguing with
yourself learn the power of quick
decision learn how to decide about
things instantly

  and so forth and so on ina made me
read the advertisement all through and i
seemed to get the idea that if you read the
book once you surely couldnt help turning
out to be at least a united states senator
unless you broke a leg or something if
you read it through twice youd have the
president worrying about his job and if
you read it through three times youd be
able to hold down an information hut in
the grand central station and neve- turn
a hair and it only cost four dollars and
fifty-six cents postpaid

   well asked ina  what do you
think about it jim

   why i says  i dont know i cant
seem to quite make up my mind
whether-

  there you go says she but it
doesnt make any difference anyway
youre going to get that book artdjybre
going right through it from the first page
to the last and youre going to learn how
to do everything it says im going to
make you do it

  so you see i never had a chance the
same day we got the book the team started
on a western tour-and ina tagged along
and nights when id a lot rather been with


the argosy

the gang or take in a show or something
ina would drag me off to our room and sic
me onto professor aloysius x beecroft
we tackled it together-though goodness
knows the wife didnt need the course ill
say she didnt and before we got back
home id done just what ina had said i
was going to do-id been through profes-
sor aloysius x beecrofts book from the
first page to the last and it was a big
book too

  before we reached the end-honestly i
could fairly hear the old brain creak but
i stuck to it-with ina right there at my
elbow why wouldnt i-and i won out
and i know opinions vary but i want to
say that as far as im concerned the finest
two words in the english language are
 the  and  end

  i asked ina if she noted any improve-
ment in my condition and she said that
she didnt seem to make up her mind
whether i had improved any or not but
if it turned out that i hadnt id have to
read the book again so about then i
made up my mind that it was up to me to
be decisive-instantly i had a hunch that
what id read was going to do me a lot of
good-when ina was around anyway

  then it came-the chance on the
morning of the second day after we got
back from the western trip i got a hurry
call on the phone from the club secretary
telling me to report at headquarters on the
jump well here was one time when i
didnt need professor aloysius x beecroft
to help me make up my mind i went
and when i came away from there i was
manager of the pink sox-temporarily
george simmons had taken the count from
the flu and the magnate had turned over
the management of the team to me-until
simmons was able to get around again
ibgstekold man didnt say much-i mean
aioqjpsf course but somehow i man-
aged to  the idea that it was up to me
if i had anything now was my time to
show it

  and when i told ina what had hap-
pened-

   jim says she  its your chance go
in and win and whatever else you do-
dont hesitate

   me says i  hesitate when ive
got to read that book again if i do i
should say not 

  as for its being my chance i knew that
simmons had only signed on for a year
and that he and alonzo didnt hitch very
well and so--well maybe it did look like
something of the sort

  now the situation was like this that
year the whales had made a runaway race
of it and we were having it out hammer
and tongs with the white caps for the sec-
ond position i had the white caps to
beat and if i came through the fans would
be satisfied and so would alonzo j brown
-which was the main point until mc-
burney took hold the year before the team
had always been a second division outfit
the season had only a little over a month
to go and alonzo had said that there
wasnt a chance of simmonss getting back
into harness

  so you see that after all there wasnt
much to it all i had to do was beat the
white caps and-not hesitate

  well i had it put right up to me the
first day i took hold we were playing
the comets a heavy-hitting crew but a
leavitt was on the mound for us and a
was going great guns the game rocked
along until the last half of the seventh
without either side scoring we went to
bat with one out we got a man on third

  then i saw it coming the comet
pitcher had the batter in a hole two strikes
and one ball he was a weak hitter and
it was a cinch hed fan a leavitt was
next up and if a ever hit a ball hed be so
astonished that he couldnt run to first
anyway a thinks that baseball bats are
made for the same purpose as indian clubs
-to swing with and that would make
the third out

  so would i stick in a pinch-hitter for
a leavitt and take a chance on finishing
out the game with another pitcher or
wouldnt i would i or wouldnt i yes
or no if i put in a pinch-hitter for a he
might land that run and the run might
win the game and it might not and what
would happen to the new pitcher and
then too-but never mind all that now
would i or wouldnt i yes or no
he who hesitates is bossed



  well sir im going to tell the dead
straight truth in spite of the wife in spite
of aloysius x beecroft-in spite of blazes
-i couldnt quite seem to make up my
mind and in a minute-

  i dodged into a door that led under the
grand stand

  i was out again in just a jiffy as i
came out i heard the umps sing out  bat-
ter out that fellow had whiffed just
like id known he would

  then spike mcginnis tackled me leav-
itt was walking toward the plate and i
hadnt said a word

   see here jim spike fired at me
 aint you going to put in platt to pinch
a hit for leavitt believe me we need that
run

   nix i says  leavitt stays in the
game

   some manager snarled spike  some
manager zip there goes the ball
game

  leavitt took a strike two balls and-
poked one out of the lot and yet youll
hear em say that the day of miracles is
past

   well what do you know about that
says spike he was certainly disgusted
 here you go to work and pull a prize
bone and darned if you dont get away
with it you lucky stiff-how dyou do
it

   judgment spike says i  judg-
ment

   judgment nothing he says and took
his grouch somewhere else

  just a word about spike mcginnis you
understand spike was an old-timer and a
privileged character or else i wouldnt
have allowed him to talk to me that way-
not right out in public anyhow and be-
sides as it happened spike was out of
luck-or thought he was-and so he was
pretty well down on the world in general

  you see spike was superstitious and-
well it was like this after the game the
day before when we were walking out of
the ball lot spike had offered to spin me
for a couple of nut sundaes or something

i said all right and spike tossed the coin
when it came down he muffed it and it hit
the ground and rolled we must have

looked for it for at least half an hour but
we couldnt find it and so that was
spikes trouble the coin was what spike
called his  lucky piece and now hed lost
it and believe him he was in for trouble--
hed bet a cooky he was going to get the
rheumatism in his throwing arm again and
he had a hunch-right then that his wifes
mother was planning another visit and so
forth and so on

  and so you see there was some excuse
for spikes feeling the way he did seeing
he was superstitious like that

   ill cover the next few weeks by sim-
ply saying that i didnt hesitate maybe
id better add a little something to that
at any rate i didnt get caught at it ina
was certainly one pleased woman-and
every little while shed mention how much
good that book had done me and of
course i agreed with her anyway when
any little question came up at the house i
decided about it right off the bat i had
a picture of myself wading through pro-
fessor aloysius x beecroft again

   as for the rest we stayed right up thery
with the white caps holding second place
turn and turn about only a few percentage
points separating the two teams at any
time of course in order to do that i had
to get the breaks at least some of the time
as to whether i got them or not-all you
had to do was ask spike mcginnis hed
say i did and in the big pinches when
it was up to me to come through with a
decision-i came and if i hesitated-
well anyway nobody noticed it at least
i thought-but never mind that just now

  and as regards the magnate-well
alonzo had picked up a few measly mil-
lions by never tipping off his hand and so
he had come to the conclusion that it was
a pretty good policy and he kept it right
up in my case he didnt throw any brick-
bats at me-or any bouquets all he did
was to keep me guessing was i making
good with him you could search me

  then according to the schedule the
white caps came to town for a five-game
series that would close the season as it
happened we were in second place then
and to hold the position it was up to us to
win at least three out of the five set-tos


the argosy

the fans were wild even alonzo j brown
appeared to be worried about something
or other and for me-i can remember a
lot of times when ive felt a whole lot easier
in my mind than i did then

  and ina was the worst of the lot you
see ina had got an idea into her head that
this series was a make-or-break thing with
jim vanness-and maybe it was

  it would be hard to find two teams more
evenly matched than the pink sox and the
white caps for instance we split the
first four games of that series fifty-fifty-
two and two

  we locked horns for the fifth battle
cutting it short when the white caps
went to bat in the first half of the seventh
--the lucky or unlucky seventh-the score
was two to nothing-in our favor so far
so good a leavitt the king pin of the
pink sox twirling squad was dealing em
for us and he was never in trouble-until
that same seventh inning

  then before you could say jack robin-
son the bases were filled the first three
men up had hit safely three on and none
down the white caps were rattling bats
yelling their heads off and all that and
the grand stand and bleachers were full of
maniacs yelling  take him out

  well would i or wouldnt i would i
pull leavitt or not yes or no

  to save my life i couldnt quite seem to
make up my mind i tried to remember
what professor aloysius x beecroft ad-
vised you to do when a feather-headed fil-
bert went up in the air and started blow-
ing a ball game-and so far as i could
recollect he hadnt covered the situation at
all and there iwas

  i happened to be standing by that little
door that led under the grand stand-and
i dodged into it

  it wasnt ten seconds when i turned to
go out again-and ran plump into spike
mcginnis he had followed me under
the grand stand and had been standing
right behind me all the time

   give it here said spike

  i gave it to him

  then spike shot out one word-putting
as much scorn and sarcasm into it as if
hed made a half-hour speech

   judgment

  now of course there wasnt any time to
settle it then-and so well let the expla-
nation go till the proper moment

  just the instant spike and i stepped out
from underneath the stand the fourth man
up for the white caps met leavitts first
delivery squarely on the nose-and a run
came in two to one none down and the
bases still choked hod wheeler the pink
sox backstop straightened up took off his
mask and strolled down to the mound to
pass the time of day with leavitt and
the whole pink sox ball club including the
kid that looked after the bats-and spike
mcginnis-the whole pack were after me
like wolves to pull leavitt and save the
game

  would i or wouldnt i

  leavitt turned and looked toward the
bench

  i signaled to him to stick and then i
made a little speech to the bunch of es-
caped lunatics that were dancing around
me and trying to tell me how to run a ball
club

  nothing stirring i says leavitt
stays in

   holy hope sobbed spike mcginnis
 and thats what you call judgment
good-by ball game farewell to you

  leavitt knelt down and fussed with a
shoe-string then he straightened up-
and fanned two men hand-running the
next hitter zipped one straight down the
first-base line and the first-sacker made
the play without taking his foot off the bag
and as it turned out the game was won
and of course i dont know but it surely
looked to me as if everybody was happy
except perhaps the white caps-and
spike mcginnis

  at any rate i knew that spike wasnt
satisfied

  right after the game i went looking for
spike and no doubt spike was looking for
me but alonzo j brown the magnate
saw me first he shook me by the hand
and congratulated me i thanked him
then he said

   and just a word jim when i make
a mistake im willing to acknowledge it
and i want to say that ive had you wrong
he who hesitates is bossed



ive always thought you were one of these
-these waverers you know what i mean
one of these fellows that take a couple of
weeks to make up their minds about some-
thing-and then they arent quite sure
so ina was right yes on the whole
shes a pretty bright young woman

    but i take it all back went on alon-
zo  take this afternoon for instance
you came through with a decision and you
came through with it quick and -right
ill say it was mighty good judgment leav-
ing leavitt in and so now jim about
this manager thing simmons is through
and if you want the job its yours

    youve hired a manager says i

   and i never hesitated

   spike mcginnis and i got together right
away afterward in a quiet corner of the
clubhouse

    well spike says i trying to be very
careless about it  looks like maybe youve
got a little something on me

    ill say i have says spike

    what do you know i asked trying
to draw him out

    what do i know says be ill tell
you what i know ive had my eye on you
for some time and this afternoon i got the
goods on you and i know that every time
its been up to you to make some kindof
a decision and make it in a hurry-like
whether to pull a pitcher or stick in a
pinch-hitter or something-youve been
sneaking around a comer or under the
grand stand or somewhere and tossiivg a
coin to see what youd do

    righto says i putting all the brass
into it i could

    and whats more youve been doing ii
with my kicky-piece you robber says
spike

    right again says i  but msten
spike heres how it was you remember
i was with you when you lost it and just
before the game next day the day i took
hold of the team i stumbled onto it right
where it got away from you it was right
in plain sight all the time the way things
generally are when you cant find em
and i stuck it in the pocket of my shirt-

i had on my uniform-meaning to hand it
to you of course

   well i got into a pinch that day-
couldnt make up my mind what to do
about something-and i happened to re-
member that i had that coin in my shirt
pocket and so i dodged under the stand
and tossed the coin heads or tails to see
what id do

   can you beat it says spike  judg-
ment

   things came my way i went on
 and so i got to thinking that maybe this
was a sort of  lucky-piece  after all-
though of course you know im not super-
stitious or anything like that-and so
well i hung onto it meaning to give it
back to you some time of course and
afterwards whenever i got into a jam and
couldnt quite seem to make up my
mind-

   dont i know it says spike  oh
yeh meaning to give it back to me some
time yeh some time and of course
you aint superstitious or nothing-oh no
but how about me how about me lis-
ten didnt the wifes mother come to
visit us just like i said she would and
aint i been on the bench for two weeks
with old john j rheumatism in the money
arm just like i said i would and-but
let it go i want to ask you something
heads or tails eh for instance how did
you frame up that proposition about leav-
ig leavitt in this afternoon

   why says i not getting what hes
driving at  a proposition like that would
naturally frame up this way heads yes
tails no heads i pull him tails i leave
him in why

   i guess you never took a good look at
this little piece of change did you asked
spike  here look it over--good

   as it happened i never had looked at it
very carefully id simply used it when i
had to and then-tried to forget it but
i took a good long look at it then it was
a fifty-cent piece as i knew already of
course and thats as far as id got

  and so help me john roger it was a
trick coin both sides were tails

   must be you thought tails was having
an awful ran jeered spike

   i never noticed i says  you see

i only used the coin eight or ten or maybe


the argosy

a dozen times all told and generally there-
was two or three days in between times
and so-i never noticed

   well-says spike  in case you never
noticed something else the next time you
shave yourself take a look in the glass and
youll notice the luckiest stiff in the world 
and ill admit frankly that i almost be-
lieved him

  well taking it by and large its a kind
of complicated thing when you consider
the possibilities and ill let you figure it
out yourself if you can but anyway ill
say this the contrary-mindeds certainly
had everything their own way and well
let the rest of that little heart-to-heart talk
between spike and me go too ill merely
say that to me it shapes up a good deal
like this as long as im manager of the

pink sox spike mcginnis will never have
to go looking for a job not that theres
any regular understanding between us but
-well maybe a sort- of understanding you
know

  and so thats the story of how i got my
start this year-how i won the worlds
championship-thats another story so
ill pass it up except to say that spike mc-
ginnis says - but you know what spike
says ina splits the credit about eighty-
twenty between herself and professor aloy-
sius x beecroft and me of course im
on the little end as for me im not say-
ing a word-more than this ive learned-
and ill leave it to you to guess where-
that the big idea is to decide-and dont
hesitate and if you go wrong- its a
poor boss that has no alibi

dreamland

 bleak the winter night without
 cold the hearth within

 loud the gale with roar and rout
 doleful clash and din

 swirling clouds are scurrying by-
 restless spirits they

 melting merging still they fly
 doom comes with the day

 though the tempests towering arua
 rock the flaming skies

 there be places hidden calm

 where his fury dies

 so my spirit void of will

 restless ever flies

 round a center that is still

 wherein dreamland lies

 raging storms of passion cease
 on this hallowed shore

 tempest wrath is stilled and peace
 bideth evermore

 wraiths of many another scene-
 scenes i hold full dear

 and the dearer might-have-been-
 these in dreams appear

 so i counting storm and strife
 as but things that seem

 find a richersweeter life
 in the land of dreams

what has already happened

the first inkling of a conspiracy to ruin him came to kane lawler of the circle l when
gary warden buyer for a cattle company at willets repudiated lawlers oral contract with
wardens predecessor lefingwell lawlers meeting with simmons freight agent further
strengthened this belief warden had stated that he could have all the cars he wanted-simmons
had said there were none prior to his trip to town lawler who had inherited his fathers
prowess with a gun thrashed the son of have singleton for attacking ruth hamlin whom
lawler loved and whose father had been encouraged to rustle lawlers stock by singleton but
at simmonss suggestion that lawler would make it hot for them-in the matter of the refusal
of cars for the shipment of his stock-warden sneered

    lawler went immediately to the willets hotel where in a conversation with several ranch
owners they appointed him spokesman to visit the capitak-for they were all in the same boat
meantime following wardens talk with singleton in which the latter had spoken of a certain
blondy antrim and kinneys canon and ms encouragement of the latters hatred for lawler
warden yielding to his passion for ruth attacked her at her cabin in her fathers absence lawler
however coming on the scene spared warden at ruths plea later dispatching hamlin-whom
he had given a job at the circle l-on a mysterious mission prior to his futile visit to the
capital and his interviews with hatfield railroad commissioner and governor haughton

    lawler was now convinced that the invisible power was widespread hatfield was a part
oi it-as well as haughton after giving the story o the governors refusal to help him to
metcalf of the news lawler returning to willets met with an added proof if such were
necessary of the far-reaching conspiracy against him a new ordinance bad been passed abrogating
the old  vent  law by which owners registering their cattle had been protected against rustlers
then after leaving three thousand head at home at blackburn the foremans suggestion lawler
with his men took the tom long trail to red rock five hundred miles away

    but of the hazards which confronted them warden knew and singleton knew the latter
snarled bestially showed yellow at the last minute he whispered to warden only drivin
about half of them well well take care of them hes leavin before the winters over

chapter xii

obligation

after the departure of lawler on the
night of gary wardens visit to the
hamlin cabin silence vast and deep
reigned inside the last golden shadows
from the sinking sun yielded to the somber
shades of twilight as ruth came to the door
and peered outward to see lawler riding
away

  for a long time the girl watched lawler
her face burning with shame over what had
happened her senses revolting from the
realization of the things lawler knew con-
cerning her father then she seated her-
self on the threshold of the doorway watch-
ing the long shadows steal over the plains

  she loved lawler she had never at-
tempted to deny it not even to herself
and she had found it hard to restrain herself
when he had stood outside the door of her
room gravely pleading with her pride only
had kept her from yielding-the humiliat-
ing conviction that she was not good enough
for him-or rather that her fathers crimes
had made it impossible for her to accept
lawyer upon a basis of equality

  she felt that lawler would take her upon
any terms-indeed his maimer while in the
cabin shortly before convinced her of that
but she did not want to go to him under
those conditions she would have felt al-
ways as though pity for her had influ-
enced him she felt that she would al-
ways be searching his eyes probing them

this story began in the argosy for  arch 

 argosy	


the argosy

for signs which would indicate that he was
thinking of her father

  and he was certain to think of him-
thog thoughts would come in spite of his
efforts to forget they would be back of
every glance he threw at her they would be
lurking always near to humiliate her the
conviction sent a shudder over her

  the girls mental processes were not in-
volved they went directly unwaveringly
to the truth-the truth as her heart re-
vealed it as she knew it must be if there
wras any subconscious emotion in her heart
or mind from which might spring chaotic
impulses that would cloud her mental vision
she was not aware of it her thoughts ran
straight and true to the one outstanding
vivid and overwhelming fact that she could
not marry kane lawler because to marry
him would mean added humiliation

  greatness ruth knew was hedged
about by simplicity lawler was as direct
inhis attitude toward life-and to herself
-as she there was about him no waver-
ing no indecision no mulling over in his
mind the tangled threads of thought that
would bring confusion the steel fiber of
his being was unelastic he met the big
questions of life with an eagerness to solve
them instantly

  he wanted her-she knew but she as-
sured herself that she could not bring upon
him the shame and ignominy of a relation-
ship with a cattle thief no matter how in-
tensely he wanted her that would be do-
ing him an injustice and she would never
agree to it

  but it hurt this knowledge that she could
not marrylawler that she must put away
from her the happiness that might be hers
for the taking that she must crush the
eager impulses that flashed through her
that she must repulse the one man who
could make her heart beat faster the man
for whom she longed with an intensity that
sometimes appalled her

  she got up after a while and lighted an
oil lamp placing it upon the table in the big
room she closed the door and then
dropped listlessly into a chair beside the
table her eyes glistening her lips quivering

  the future was somber in aspect almost
hopeless it seemed and yet into her mind

as she sat there crept a determination-a
resolution to tell her father what she knew
to tell him that she could no longer endure
the disgrace of his crimes

  that meant of course that she would
have to leave him for she knew he was
weak and that he had been drawn into
crime and had not the moral strength to
redeem himself

  when about midnight she heard the beat-
ing of hoofs near the cabin jie sat very
quiet rigid still determined her eyes
flashing

  she was standing near the door of her
room when her father entered and as he
stood for an instant blinking at the light
trying to accustom himself to it after rid-
ing for some time through the darkness
she watched him noting-at she had noted
many times before-the weakness of his
mouth and the furtive gleam of his eyes

  he had not always been like that be-
fore the death of her mother she had always
admired him aware of the sturdiness of his
character of his rugged manliness and of
his devotion to her mother

  adversity had changed him had weak-
ened him and now watching him not-
ing the glow in his eyes when he saw her-
the pathetic worship in them-her heart
protested the decision that her cold judg-
ment had made and she ran to him with a
little quavering pitying cry and buried
her face on his shoulder shuddering mur-
muring sobbingly

   oh daddy oh daddy what have you
done

  he stood rigid his eyes wide with aston-
ishment looking down at her as -she clung
to him as though wondering over a sud-
den miracle for heunew she was not an
emotional girl and this evidence almost
stunned him

   why honey  he patted her hair and
her cheeks and hugged her tightly to him
and presently he gently disengaged him-
self and held her at arms length peering
into her face

  and then when her clear eyes met his
-her gaze direct and searching even
through her tears-he paled his gaze
drooped and his arms fell to his sides

   ive dene enough ruth he said
the trail horde



   why daddy-why did you do it oh
you have made it so hard for me

   there there honey he consoled
reaching out and patting her shoulders
again  ive been a heap ornery but it
aint goin to happen again his eyes
shone through a mist that had come into
them

   ive been talkin with kane lawler an
he opened my eyes ive been blind ruth-
blind to what it all meant to you an from
now on im goin straight-straight as a
die

   ruth he went on when he saw in-
credulity in her gaze  i wasnt to tell you
i reckon lawler would half kill me if he
knowed i was tellin you but there aint
no use ive got-

   did you give your word to lawler
daddy

   i sure did but ive got to tell you
ruth mebbe you knowin will sort of help
me to go through with it

   kane lawler was here this mornin-
he come here to see me about a circle l
cow that i was runnin my brand on the
night before he talked mighty plain to
me-an earnest he offered me a job over
to the circle l an i took it

   i rode over there this afternoon an
lawlers straw-boss put me to work then
to-night lawler rode in an took me out
by the corral he gave it to me straight
there hes goin to restock my place an
give me a chance to get on my feet hes
goin to put his shoulder behind me he
says an make me run a straight trail-
talcin a mortgage on the place to secure
him

   he give me a letter to his mother
say in i was to hase what stock i wanted
an im to repay him when i get around to
it honey ive got a chance an im
never goin to slip again

  ruth walked to the door and threw it
open standing on the threshold and gazing
out into the dull moonlight across the vast
sweep of plain from which came the low
moaning of the night wiijd laden with mys-
tery

  for a long time as she stood there pride
fought a savage battle with duty her
face was pallid her lips tight-clenched and

shame unutterable gripped her to be
sure lawler had enjoined her father to si-
lence and it was evident that she was not to
know still she did know and lawler had
added an obligation a debt to the already
high barrier that was between them

  yet she dared not evade the obligation
for that would be robbing her father of a
chance over which he seemed to exult a
chance which promised his redemption-
for which she had prayed

  her heart was like lead within her-a
dull weight that threatened to drag her
down and yet it throbbed with gratitude
with hope and with thankfulness for if
her father really meant to try-if he should
succeed in redeeming himself in lawlers
eyes and in her own she might one day be
able to go to lawler with no shame in her
heart with the comforting assurance that
her father had earned the right to hold his
head up among men to be sure there
would always be the shadow of the past
mistake lurking behind but it would be the
shadow of a mistake corrected of a black
gulf bridged

  her father was waiting when she finally
turned to him-waiting his chin on his
chest his face crimson with shame

   ruth girl-you aint goin to judge me
too harsh are you he begged

  again she could not resist the pathetic
appeal in his eyes she ran to him again
holding him tightly to her a cool gust
swept in through the open doorway-the
night wind laden with mystery but the
girl laughed and snuggled closer to the
man and the man laughed hoarsely vi-
brantly in a voice that threatened to break

chapter xiii

kinneys canon

at the close of the second day the big
trail herd halted at the edge of the vast
level over which it had come the herd
had been driven forty miles cattle men
and horses had passed through a country
which was familiar to them  a country fea-
tured by long grama-grass greasewood and
cactus plants

there was no timber on the level the


the argosy

gray of the grama-grass and the bare
stretches of alkali were brightened by the
silvery glare of a sun that swam in a cloud-
less sky of deepest azure except for the
men the cattle the horses and the two
slow-moving awkward-looking canvas-cov-
ered wagons there had been no evidence of
life on the great plain in a silence un-
broken save by the clashing of horns the
bleating and bawling of the cattle the
ceaseless creaking of the wagons and the
low voices of the men the cavalcade moved
eastward

  the wind that swept over the plains was
chill it carried a tang that penetrated
that caused the men especially in the early
morning to turn up the collars of their
woolen shirts as they rode a chill that
brought a profane protest from the tawny-
haired giant who had disclosed to lawler
the whereabouts of joe hamlin that night
in the circle l bunk-house

  the first camp had been made on the
wolf-at a shallow about five miles north
of the two bar hamlins ranch and
with the clear sparkling icy water of the
river on his face and glistening beads of
it on his colorless eyelashes the giant had
growled to several of his brother cowboys
who were likewise performing their ablu-
tions at the river

   this damn wind is worse n a kansas
regular you lean agin it an it freezes
you you turn your back to it an youve
got to go clawin icicles out of your back
why in hell cant they have a wind thats
got some sense to it

  it aint c-cold shorty jibed a slen-
der puncher with a saturnine eye and a
large mobile mouth

   kells grinned the giant  your voice
is froze right now

  and yet the men enjoyed the cold air it
had a tonic effect upon them they were
energetic eager and always ravenously
hungry the cook offered testimony on
that subject unsolicited

   i never seen a bunch of mavericks that
gobbled more grub than this here outfit
he stated on the second morning  or that
swilled more coffee he added  seems
like all they come on this drive for is to
eat

  toward the close of the second day cor-
rugations began to appear in the level lit-
tle ridges and valleys broke the monotony
of travel rocks began to dot the earth the
gray grass disappeared the barren stretches
grew larger and more frequent and the
yucca and the lancelike ocotilla began to
appear here and there

  the trend of the trail had been upward
all afternoon-gradual at first hardly
noticeable but as the day drew to a close
the cattle mounted a slope progressing more
slowly and the horses hitched to the wagons
began to strain the harness

  the rise seemed to be endless-to have
no visible terminus for it went up and up
until it melted into the horizon like the
brow of a hill against the sky but when
after hours of difficult travel herd and men
gained the summit a broad green-brown
mesa lay before them

  the mesa was miles wide and ran an
interminable distance eastward looking
back over the way they had come the men
could see that the level over which they
had ridden for the past two days was in
reality the floor of a mighty valley far
away into the west they could see a break in
the mesa-where it sloped down to merge
into the plains near willets the men
knew that beyond that break ran the steel
rails that connected the town with red
rock their destination

  but it was plain to them that the rails
must make a gigantic curve somewhere in
the invisible distance or that they ran
straight into a range of low mountains that
fringed the northern edge of the mesa

  lawler enlightened the men at the camp-
fire that night

   the railroad runs almost straight from
willets he said  theres a tunnel
through one of the mountains and other
tunnels east of it and theres a mountain
gorge with plenty of water in it where the
railroad runs on a shelving level blasted
out of the wall the mountains form a bar-
rier that keeps willets and the wolf river
section blocked in that direction its the
same south of here the only difference be-
ing that in the south there is no railroad
until you strike the southern pacific and
thats a long distance to drive cattle
the trail horde	

  when the herd began to move the fol-
lowing morning blackburn sent them over
the mesa for several miles and then began
to head them down a gradual slope leav-
ing the mesa behind there was a faint
trail narrow over which in other days cat-
tle had been driven for the grass had been
trampled and cut to pieces and in some
places- there were still prints of hoofs in the
baked soil

  the slope grew sharper narrowing as it
descended and the cattle moved down it in
a sinuous living line until the leaders were
out of sight far around a bend at least a
mile distant

  blackburn was at the head of the herd
with three men riding some little distance
in front of the cattle inspecting the trail
lawler and the others were holding the
stragglers at the top of the mesa endeavor-
ing to prevent the crowding and confusion
which always results when massed cattle are
being held at an outlet

  it was like a crowd of eager humans at-
tempting to move through an open doorway
at the same instant the cattle were plung-
ing jostling the concerted impulse
brought the inevitable confusion-a jam
that threatened frenzy

  at lawiers orders the men drew off and
the cattle relieved of th menace which al-
ways drives them to panic in such a situa-
tion began to filter through and to follow
their leaders down the narrow trail

  down always down the trail led grow-
ing narrower gradually until at last cattle
and men were moving slowly on a rocky
floor with the sheer wall of the mesa on one
side and a craggy towering butte on the
other

  the clatter of hoofs the clashing of
horns the bellowing the rumble of the
wagons over the rocks and the ring of iron-
shod hoofs created a bedlam of sound
which echoed and reechoed from the tower-
ing walls until the uproar was deafening

  shorty the tawny-haired giant was rid-
ing close to lawler

  he had never ridden the trail though he
had heard of it he leaned over and
shouted to lawler

   kinneys canon aint it

  lawler nodded

    well shouted shorty  its a lulu
 aint it

   for a short time the trail led downward
 then there came a level stretch smooth
 damp the day was hours old and the sun
 was directly overhead but down in the
 depths of the canon it was cool and a
 steady wiad- blew into the faces of the men

   the herd was perhaps an hour passing
 through the canon and when lawler and
 shorty riding side by side emerged from
 the cool gloom they saw the cattle descend-
 ing a  shallow gorge going toward a wide
 slope which dipped into a basin of mam-
 moth size

   lawler knew the place- he had ridden
 this trail many times in the years before the
 coming of the railroad and when he
 reached the crest of the slope and looked
 out into the hazy slumbering distance he
 was- not surprised though his eyes quick-
 ened with appreciation for its beauty

   thirty miles of virgin land lay before
 him basking in the white sunlight-a green-
 brown bowl through which flowed a river
 that shimmered like silver the dark bases
 of mountains loomed above the basin at the
 eastern ridge-a serrated range with lofty
 peaks that glowed white in the blue of the
 sky south and north were other moun-
 tains-somber purple giants with pine-clad
 slopes and gleaming peaks-majestic im-
 mutable

   looking down from where he sat on red
 king lawler could see the head of the
 herd far down the ever-broadening trail
 tlte leaders were so far away that they
 seemed to be mere dots-black dots moving
  in an emerald lake

   the cattle too had glimpsed the alluring 
 green that spread before them and at a
 little distance from lawler and several of
 the other men they were running eager for
 the descent

    shes a whopper aint she said
 shortys voice at lawlers side  ive seen
 a heap of this mans country but never
 nothin like that i reckon if the lord
 had spread her out a little mite further shed
 have took in mighty near the whole earth
 its mighty plain he wasnt skimpin
 things none anyway when he made this
 here little hollow


the argosy

  he grinned as he rode and then waved
a sarcastic hand toward the cattle

  look at em runnin youd think
havin projected around this here country
for a year or so theyd be better judges
theyre thinkin theyll be buryin their
mugs in that right pretty grass in about
fifteen seconds judgin from the way theyre
hittin the breeze toward it an itll take
them half a day to get down there

  shorty was a better judge of distance
than the cattle for it was after noon when
the fast of the herd reached the level floor
of the basin they spread out to graze in-
dustriously the men not caring knowing
they would not stray far from such grass

  by the time the chuck wagon had come to
a halt and the cook had clambered stiffly
from his seat to prepare the noonday meal
lawler and the others saw the horse
wrangler and his assistant descending the
long slope with the remnda the horses
had fallen far behind and lawler rode to
meet them curious to know what had hap-
pened

  when he rode up the horse wrangler a
man named garvin-a stocky individual
with keen inquiring eyes-advanced to
meet him

   boss he said shortly  theres some-
thin mighty wrong goin on behind us me
an ed-my helper-has been kind of hang-
in back bein sort of curious theys a
bunch of ornery-lookin guys trailin us i
first saw em after wed struck the bottom
of that canon they was just cornin
around that big bend an i saw em they
lit out turnin tail-mebbe figurin i hadnt
seen em but pretty soon i seen em again
sort of sneakin behind us i reckon if they
was square guys they wouldnt be sneakin
like that-eh

chapter xiv

blondy antrim

yjhen lawler spoke to blackburn re-
garding the news that had been com-
municated to him by the horse wrangler
blackburn suggested that himself and sev-
eral of the circle l men ride back to ascer-
tain the object of the trailers

   wrell ride back an make em talk  he
declared heatedly

  lawler however would not agree tell-
ing blackburn that the trail was free and
that until the men made some hostile move
there was no reason why they should be ap-
proached

  so the men ate selected new mounts
from their  strings  in the remnda and
again started the big herd forward

  lawler rode for a time wth garvin
keeping an alert eye on the back trail but
though he could see far up the canon where
the trail-white with dust from the passing
of the herd-wound its sinuous way upward
into the dark recesses between the towering
mesa walls he could see no sign of life or
movement

  the non-appearance of the mysterious
riders was suspicious for if their intentions
were friendly they would have come boldly
on in fact if they were abroad upon an
honest errand they must have found the
slowness of the herd ahead of them irk-
some and they would have passed it as
soon as possible merely to escape the dust
cloud raised by the cattle

  when the afternoon began to wane the
herd was far out in the basin traveling
steadily toward a point where the little river
doubled where blackburn intended to camp
for the night and though both blackburn
and lawler scanned the back trail intently
at intervals there was still no sign of the
riders garvin had mentioned

  nor did the riders pass the herd in the
night blackburn threw an extra guard
around the cattle making the shifts shorter
and more frequent and when daylight came
a short conference among the circle l men
disclosed the news that no riders had
passed if any riders had passed the cow-
boys must have seen them for there had
been a moon and the basin in the vicinity of
the herd was clear and unobstructed

  enraged at the suspicious nature of the
incident blackburn took half a dozen
cowboys and rode back while the remainder
of the trail crew sent the herd eastward
it was late in the afternoon when black-
burn returned disappointed  grim and
wrathful

   theres a bunch trailin us all right
the trail horde	

he told lawler  about a dozen we seen
where theyd stopped back in the canon
a ways-where garvin said hed seen em
sneakin back we lost their tracks there
for they merged with ours am we couldnt
make nothin of em

  but at the foot of the slope we picked
em up again looks like they separated
some of them went north an some went
south i reckon that during the night
they sneaked around the edge of the basin
its likely theyre hidin in the timber some-
where watchin us if you say the word
ill take some of the boys an rout em out
well find what theyre up to damn em

   as long as they dont bother us we
wont bother them said lawks  its
likely they wont bother us

  again that nightthe men worked in ex-
tra shifts and the fallowing morning the
herd climbed out of the basin and strag-
gled up a narrow trail through some foot-
hills at noon they passed through a defile
between two mighty mountains and when
twilight came they had descended some low
hihs on the other side and went to camp
for the night on a big grass level near the
river they had followed for three days

  the level upon which they camped was
much lower than the floor of the big biij
for the water from the river came tumbling
out of a narrow gorge between the hills
through which the herd had passed

  they were in a wild section picturesque
rugged there was plenty of water and
blackburn and lawler both knew that there
would be water enough for the herd all the
way to red rock there was a section
of desert before -them which they would
strike before many days but they would
cross the desert in one day barring delay
and there seemed to be no reason why the
long drive should not prove successful de-
spite the mountain trails-most of them
hazardous-through which they still must
pass

  and yet the men were restless the con-
tinued presence of an invisible menace near
by disturbed them they had not seen the
mysterious riders again but there was not a
man in the outfit who did not feel them-
not a man but was convinced that the
riders were still trailing them

  long ago the younger men had ceased
to laugh and joke during the day they
kept gazing steadily into the gulf of space
that surrounded them carefully scrutinizing
the timber and the virgin brush which might
form a covert and at night they were sul-
len expectant every man wearing his gun
when he rolled himself in his blanket

  it was not fear that had seized them
they were rugged hardy courageous men
who had looked death jfi the face many
times defying it mocking it and no visible
danger could have disturbed them

  but this danger was not visible it was
stealthy secret lurking near always
threatening always expected it might
stalk behind them it might be flanking
them as they rode or it might creep upon
them in the night

  blackburn had fallen into a vicious mood
his eyes glowed with the terrible futile rage
that surged in his veins it was a reflection
of a wrath that grew more and more in-
tolerant as the days passed and the danger
a at portended did not materialize

   boss he said to lawler on the tenth
day following that on which garvin had
reported the presence of the riders behind
them  the boys is gettin jumpy theyre
givin one another short answers an theyre
growlin about little things that they never
noticed before

   im gettin fed up on this thing too
its a cinch them riders is following us i
seen em dustin north of us this mornin i
aint said anything to the boys but its
likely theyve seen em too-for theyve got
their eyes peeled its gettin under mjr
skin an if they dont come out into the
open pretty soon and give us an idea of
what game theyre playin me an some of
the boys is goin to drag em out 

  yet blackburn did not carry out his
threat he knew pursuit of the riders
would be futile for there were no further
signs of them for several days and black-
burn knew the pursuers would have no
trouble in eluding them in the vast wilder-
ness through which the herd had been pass-
ing for a week

  they had been on the trafl twenty days
when at dusk one night they moved slowly
down a wide gradual slope toward a desert


the argosy

at the foot of the slope was a water hole
filled with a dark brackish fluid with a
green scum fringing its edges

  the slope merged gently into the floor
of the desert like an ocean beach stretch-
ing out into the water and for a distance
out into the floor of the desert there was
bunch-grass mesquite and greasewood
where the cattle might find grazing for the
night beyond the stretch of grass spread
the dead gray dust somber and desolate in
the filmy mystic haze that was slowly de-
scending

  the cattle came down eagerly for they
had grazed little during the day in the
mountainous region through which they had
passed they were showing the effects of
the drive they had been sleek and fat
when they started from the circle l they
were growing lean wild and they were al-
ways ravenously hungry

  but where they could feed they required
little attention and the cowboys after halt-
ing them helped garvin establish the lines
of a rope corral into which they drove the
remuda then they built a fire and squat-
ted wearily around it-at a respectful dis-
tance-to watch the cook-and to listen to
him as he complainingly prepared supper

  the men had finished and the long
shadows of the dusk were stealing out over
the desert when lawler-sitting on the
chuck box-heard blackburn exclaim
sharply

   hells fire here they come

  blackburn had sprung to his feet his
eyes blazing with the pent-up wrath that
had been in them for many days he was
tense his muscles straining and his fin-
gers wrere moving restlessly near the butt of
the huge pistol that swung at his hip the
fingers were closing and unclosing betray-
ing the mans passion

  lawler got to his feet following the di-
rection of blackburns flaming eyes he saw
perhaps a mile away a large body of horse-
men they were descending the long- slope
over which the herd had been driven

  lawler counted them-thirty-nine but
the menace was no longer invisible it was
now a material thing which could be met on
such terms as might be with the whims of
chance to govern the outcome

  lawler did not doubt that the oncoming
riders were hostile he had felt that when
he had first been made aware of their pres-
ence behind the herd he saw too that the
men of his outfit felt as he did for they
were all on their feet their faces grim their
eyes glowing with the rage that had gripped
them over the presence of the unseen men-
ace their muscles were tensed and their
lips were in the sullen pout which presages
the imminence of action 

  shorty the tawny giant was a terrible
figure he seemed to be outwardly cool
and there was not a sign of passion in his
manner his hands swung limply at his
sides not a muscle in his body seeming to
move unlike the other men he was calm
seemingly unperturbed

  so striking was the contrast between him
and the other men that lawler looked twice
at him and the second time he saw
shortys eyes-they were gleaming pools of
passion cold repressed

   easy boys lawler called to the men
 dont let them suspect you know theyve
been trailing us theyve got us two to one
almost-if they mean trouble well have to
work easy 

  he saw the men relax and several of
them resumed their former positions at the
fire

  the strange riders were coming steadily
onward they were not more than a hundred
yards distant when blackburn exclaimed
hoarsely

   lawler its blondy antrim an his
gang damn his hide were in for it

  for the first time since garvin had told
him about the presence of the men on the
trail behind the herd lawlers face be-
trayed passion-the glow in his eyes rivaled
that in the giants

  during the past year or so word had
reached him-rumor unfounded but insis-
tent-that more than once singleton and
blondy antrim the outlaw had been seen
together he had placed no credence in
the rumors ascribing them to the imagina-
tions of mischievous brains prejudiced
against singleton because of his bluff domi-
nant manner

  he had first suspected there might be
truth in them when joe hamlin had told
the trail horde



him that he had rustled cattle for singleton
he now believed that singleton had dis-
posed of the stolen cattle through antrim
and the conviction that singleton was be-
hind the action of the outlaw in trailing the
herd through the country seized him

  in an instant-following blackburns ex-
clamation-he was aroused to the danger
that confronted himself and his men as
though by previous arrangement the men
looked at him noted the tenseness that had
come over him listened attentively when
he spoke

   boys dont offer to throw a gun i
know antrim hes a killer and his men
are like him take it easy-keep cool
the man who loses his temper will be guilty
of the wholesale murder that will follow
when antrim rides up send him after me

  he had not unsadded red king he
strode to the horse swung into the saddle
and rode eastward away from the advanc-
ing riders

  blank astonishment puzzled bewilder-
ment shone in the eyes of the circle l men
as they watched him and into the hearts of
some of them crept the conviction that law-
ler had deserted them that he was afraid
of the outlaw chief

  blackburn saw what they thought and
his burning eyes bored into them with sar-
casm unutterable he laughed hoarsely
with a grim mirth that startled them

   dont you worry about lawlers nerve
boys hes got more of it than the bunch of
us put together hes got some scheme in
mind you guys just set tight until you
find out what it is do as he told you
dont let that scurvy gang know that youre
flabbergasted 

  when lawler rode away there was a
noticeable commotion in the group of ad-
vancing horsemen one of them left the
group spurring his horse in the direction
taken by lawler he must have been called
back for he wheeled his mount after he had
ridden a dozen paces or so and rejoined
his companions who came on as before

  when the horsemen came to a halt near
the fire they were spread in a semicircle
about the circle l men and in their bronzed
immobile faces was no answer to the ques-
tion that agitated blackburn and the others

they had halted at a little distance from
the fire and one of them a tall slender
keen-eyed thin-lipped man urged his horse
out of the circle and insolently inspected
blackburn and his cowboys

  there was a sinister light in his eyes a
lurking threat in his manner

   what outfit is this he demanded

   circle l from wolf river answered
blackburn

   where you headin

   to red rock

   railroad out of business jeered the
outlaw

   far as the circle l is concerned it is
antrim smiled blackburn  we had a
fuss an quit em

  the outlaw peered intently at the other
then he grinned

  its andy blackburn he said glad
to meet you blackburn this seems like
old times-before the railroad went
through when old luke lawler used to
jam em to red rock-sometimes-when
he didnt pick up too many strays on the
way he laughed as though pleased over
the recollection  got this stock vented
blackburn

  nary a vent antrim the inspector
wasnt feelin in the humor

  ha exclaimed antrim so you
didnt get no vent well were aimin to
look through your herd weve been miss-
in cattle all summer-from my ranch the
circle bar about three thousand head
weve traced em as far as kinneys canon
an lost em but weve been thinkin
blackburn that it aint ho hard job to make
a passable circle l out of a circle bar
thats why we aim to look your cattle
over

  he grinned slightly at blackburns scowl
aware of the impotent rage the latter felt
over the greatest insult that could be offered
an honest cattleman for an instant he
watched blackburn keenly his lips sneer-
ing and then he said sharply

   who was that guy that rode away as
we come up

   lawler said blackburn  hes fig-
gerin on seein you alone looks like he
left word that when you come i was to tell
you he wanted to see you


the argosy

  the outlaws eyes glowed with swift sus-
picion

   he knowed me eh he said he
glanced keenly over the level floor of the
desert dimly in the dusk he could see
lawler riding near the herd for an instant
antrim hesitated plainly debating the
wisdom of leaving his men then he smiled
with whimsical recklessness and his move-
ments became rapid jerky

   slade he said addressing a rider near
him  youre running things till i get back

  he wheeled his horse and sent him into
the dusk toward the herd riding cautiously
evidently not entirely convinced of the
peaceableness of lawlers intentions

  he rode a quarter of a mile before he
came upon lawler and though the light
was fading he could plainly see lawyers
face set expressionless

  the outlaw brought his horse to a halt
within three or four paces of red king
antrims manner exuded the insolent toler-
ance of the master who has the confidence
that comes from thoughts of overwhelming
advantage

  he knew lawler knew him as perhaps
no other man in the section knew him for
he had seen lawler using his gun it had
been some years before when lawler had
been proving himself-proving that he had
a right to the respect and consideration of
his fellowmen proving that no man could
trifle with him

  antrim had been a witness to the shoot-
ing he had marked lawlers coolness the
evenness of his temper and had noted the
deadly swiftness and precision of his move-
ments when he had drawn his pistol law-
ler had not been the aggressor-a dozen
other men had testified to that

  antrim had not seen lawler since until
now and as he looked at him he saw that
the years had brought a change in the man
he had been a tall bold reckless-looking
youth then with a certain wild wayward-
ness in his manner that might have de-
stroyed him had he yielded to it now
he was cold calm deliberate imperturbable
the recklessness had disappeared from his
eyes they were now aglow with quiet deter-
mination the waywardness had gone-
ironlike resolution marked his manner

  and yet behind it all antrim could see
the threat of those youthful passions the
lurking eagerness for violent action the hint
of preparedness of readiness

  antrim was startled uneasy he saw
now that he should not have left his men
that he had made a mistake in coming alone
to meet lawler

  he was certain of it when he heard law-
lers voice saw the cold smiling light in
his eyes	

   youre wanting my cattle antrim
your men have been trailing me for two
weeks you dont get them youve got
thirty-nine men and there are only twenty-
three circle l men over there im not get-
ting any of them killed this thing is be-
tween you and myself get your hand
away from your gun or ill bore you

  he moved his hand where it had been-
seemingly-lying on red kings neck un-
der the mane and antrim saw the dark
muzzle of a pistol showing in the hand

   im not taking any chances antrim-
you can see that im not going to take
any if you do anything to attract the at-
tention of your men ill kill you drop
your guns using your thumbs and fore-
fingers

  he waited watching keenly until the out-
law had complied with the demand the two
big pistols thudding dully into the sand be-
side his horse

  then lawler resumed his voice low and
even as before

   now were riding back to the fire an-
trim listen hard for this means life or
death to you

   were going back to the fire youtre
going to act as though nothing had hap-
pened and you are to tell your men that
you have changed your mind about the cat-
tle-you are to tell them that you are going
with me to red rock and you are sending
them back to where you came from to wait
for you

  antrim stiffened and his face bloated
poisonously but he did not answer for
there was that in lawlers eyes that con-
vinced him of the futility of attempting re-
sistance

   youre going to red rock with me
went on lawler  im going to be per-
the trail horde



sonally responsible for you im going to
watch you youre going to ride ahead of
me if you talk or make any motion that
brings any of your men back youll die
so quick you wont know it happened do
you understand

   damn you lawler youll pay for
this muttered the outlaw ill go on
your trail and ill never let up till i get
you 

  lawler laughed lowly  just be careful
not to get any of that poison in your voice
when you tell your men what i told you
antrim or youll never go on anybodys
trail get going now and be careful
antrim wheeled his horse and lawler
spurred red king beside him

   ill be watching you antrim he
warned  if your men show they suspect
anything wrong you go down mighty rapid
you dont get off your horse until your men
go and there is to be no playing for time
you talk fast and earnest and carefully
go ahead

  riding slightly in antrims rear lawler
followed the outlaw to the fire there had
come no change in the positions of the out-
laws or of the circle l men and when an-
trim and lawler rode up there was a si-
lence during which the men of both factions
looked interrogatively at their leaders

  antrims face was pale and his voice was
vibrant with emotion but he did not hesi-
tate

   slade he said to the man he had left in
charge  ive changed my mind about these
cattle lawler has given me proof that
none of our stock is with them im hittin
the trail to red rock with lawler you
take the boys back to the ranch an wait
for me

  slades eyes widened he flushed and
peered keenly at antrim  you-why
hells fire antrim we-

   slade do as i tell you said antrim
coldly  are you runnin my affairs you
hit the breeze right now-you hear me 
slade grinned venomously and waved a
violent hand around the circle  you hear
your boss boys  he said  slope 

  the men hesitated an instant sending
sharp incredulous glances at their leader
but antrim pale knowing that if he be-

trayed the slightest sign of insincerity his
men would suspect met their looks steadily
the men wheeled their horses muttering
profanely and rode slowly westward into
the growing darkness

  when they had disappeared lawler
smiled faintly at the outlaw chief

   you can get down now antrim he
drew the pistol from red kings mane
where it had been concealed during antrims
talk with his men and heathed it and
then blackburn who had been a silent
amazed witness to what had occurred whis-
tled softly covertly poking shorty in the
ribs

   theres one thing thats as good as a
vent aint there shorty he said  thats
a gun in the hand of a man whos got plenty
of nerve

chapter xv

 medium mournful

u arly in the afternoon of the first day
of december the sky darkened and a
cold raw wind began to shriek through
willets the company corral was empty
and again as on the day before kane law-
ler had visited him gary warden stood at
one of the windows of his office smiling
warden was almost satisfied

  only one disturbing thought persistently
recurred lawler had got his cattle through
to red rock

  a crimson stain appeared in wardens
cheeks as his thoughts reverted to lawlers
return to willets after disposing of his cat-
tle to the red rock buyer and wardens
shoulders sagged a little the smile faded
and he glared malignantly at the bleak
gray clouds that sailed over town on the
chill bitter wind

  oddly at the instant wardens memory
was dwelling upon the incident of lawlers
return to willets lafe corwin the store-
keeper was mentally reviewing the incident

  willets was a cow-town and for that
season its period of activity was over all
the beef cattle in the section with the ex-
ception of three thousand head still held
by lawler at the circle l had been shipped
eastward and willets would now descend


the argosy

to supine indifference to considerations of
gain

  lafe corwin was tilted back in a big
wooden chair near the big roaring-hot stove
in the lounging-room of the willets hotel
his clerk could attend the store until
spring came corwin would spend much of
his leisure near the big stove in the hotel
talking politics and cattle-two subjects of
paramount importance 

  but just at this instant corwin was think-
ing of lawlers return to willets little
wrinkles gathered around his eyes-which
were twinkling and he chuckled lowly as
his gaze roved from one to the other of the
men who like himself were enjoying the
warmth of the stove and listening between
words to the howling and moaning of the
wind

  three or four times during silences cor-
win chuckled and when at last he saw
dave rankin the blacksmith watching him
curiously he guffawed aloud

   i dont reckon i ever seen no mourn-
fuller sight than that he declared

  meanin which asked the blacksmith
his eyes alight with truculent inquiry the
others sat erect attentively

   meanin that mornin when kane law-
ler hopped off the train with his bunch of
cow-hands-an blondy antrim snickered
corwin  dave singleton an gary war-
den an jordan an simmons an that pony-
built girl which is stayin over to the two
diamond with that ossified woman she calls
 aunt hannah was on the platform wait-
in for the six oclock train from the east
it appears that pony-built-della wharton
her name is-was expectin some gimcracks
an warden an her was waitin for them
anyways they was there it sure was
medium mournful declared corwin

  he appeared to hesitate and rankin
grinned

   weve heard it before but i reckon we
can stand listenin agin tell it corwin

   as i was sayin when you interrupted
me-it was medium mournful resumed
corwin  shorty-who was with lawler
on the drive-has told me since but at that
time i didnt know-that jordan had re-
fused to vent lawlers cattle

   well id come down to see the train

come in too we was all standin there
when she come a steamin up an stopped
an who dumb off but lawler an his trail
crew-twenty-three of em an blondy
antrim in the midst of em lookin like a
sheep-killin dog

   well gentlemen they was a scene
wrarden got his face all screwed up an
couldnt get it unscrewed agin he looked
like hed swallered a hot brandin iron an
it didnt lay easy on his stummjck single-
ton was a standin there with his mouth
open an his eyes a poppin out an jordan
was plumb flabbergasted simmons was
leanin agin the side of the station buildin
lookin like he was expectin to be shot the
next minute

   that della wharton girl was the only
one that seemed to have any wits at all i
seen her grin eloquent at lawler an look
him straight in the eye like she was tellin
him somethin intimate

   well as i was sayin lawler an his
boys got off--an blondy antrim antrim
looks wild an flighty-like youve seen a
locoed steer on the prod his eyes was a
glarin an he was mutterin cusses by the
mouthful all of which didnt seem to
feaze lawler none

   lawler was as cool as an iceberg which
had just arrove from the north pole an
then some an he got a mean mild grin
on his face when he saw the reception com-
mittee that had come to meet him they
was a twinkle in his eyes when he looked at
della wharton but when warden blows
into his line of vision he looked mighty
wicked

   lawler an his gang had brought their
hosses from red rock in two cars-theyd
sold some of the remuda in red rock not
earin to ship em home anyways the
gang didnt appear in no hurry to unload
the hosses an a trainman yells to them
sayin theyd have to hurry

   but the boys was too interested just
then  unload em yourself you sufferin
yap yells shorty if you pull out of
here with them hosses ill blow your
damned railroad over into the next county 
shorty sure does love the railroad 

   as i was sayin when you interrupted

ward warden

   warden didnt say nothin-hed lost

   but antrim didnt seem to be none
tickled now that hed got the gun he
stood lookin at it like it was somethin
strange an unusual an he was wonderin
whether he ought to hang onto it or drop
it finally he grins sorta sheepishlike an
hands it back to lawler butt first

as you all seen them boys had divided

regrets i aint never seen no mournfuller
sight than them folks sneakin away from
the station all but della wharton she
was a grinnin sorta slylike as though some-
thin pleased her

chapter xvi

the wire-cutters

then lawler returned to the circle l
ranch-house he found that his sister
mary had gone east to school she had
left for willets on the second day following
lawlers departure and mrs lawler had
already received two letters from her

  mrs lawler watched her son keenly when
she told him that joe hamlin had brought
a letter stating that hamlin was to be per-
mitted to take a number of mixed cattle
from the circle l-and that he had driven
away one hundred she smiled gently when
she told lawler that on the day before her
departure mary had visited ruth hamlin
-had spent the whole day with her and
had come home mysteriously delighted
ruth had given up the school

   mary loves her kane said mrs law-
ler and she smiled again when she saw a
flush reach lawlers face

  lawler intended to ride to the hamlin
cabin this morning it was the third day
following his return to the ranch and until
now he had had no time for anything ex-
cept to attend to the many details of work
that had been neglected during his absence

  there were still three thousand head of
cattle on the circle l range-the men had
held them in the valley for a time during
his absence on the trail but the grass had
grown sparse and the herd was now grazing
on the big plain beyond the northern slope
of the valley

  during the two days that he had been
home the outfit had been busy the circle
l had a dozen line camps-little adobe


the argosy

cabins scattered over the range occupied
during the winter by circle l cowboys
whose duty it was to guard the cattle
against the aggressions of timber wolves
and from rustlers cold and starvation

  for two days the chuck-wagon had been
sent rattling to the various line camps
stocking them with supplies against the
winter as the weather was threatening
the hoodlum wagon had been pressed into
service this morning and all the men with
the exception of the blacksmith-who was
working diligently in his shop near the cor-
ral and two punchers-davies and har-
ris who had been assigned to number one
camp-were away with the two wagons

  davies and harris had not been able to
resist the lure of  town the prosperity
that had descended upon them had made
them restless and the night before they
had importuned lawler to permit them to
spend  one more night in towtn before
holin up for the winter

  lawler had consented and now he was
wishing that he hadnt for when he
emerged from the ranch-house this morning
he saw a dark cloud bank far in the north
moving southward on the chill wind

  the herd he knew was somewhere on
the big level beyond the crest of the valley
in the vicinity of number one line camp
it was an isolated section off the trail that
led to town-a section of featureless level
near a big break in the valley

  the break opened upon another big level
that stretched southward for a hundred
miles in other days luke lawler had lost
many cattle there they had drifted through
the break by hundreds with a blizzard be-
hind them and had been swallowed by the
great waste

  two years before-aware of the previous
losses-lawler had erected a wire- fence
across the big break extending from a
craggy mountain wall on the western end
to a sheer butte that marked the end of
the break eastward

  lawler had sent red king to the crest
of the valley on his way to the hamlin
cabin when he noted that the cloud bank
in the north had grown denser nearer the
wind had increased in velocity and he had
to lean against it as he rode and it was so

cold and raw that he drew his heavy cap
down ovej his eyes to shield them and
drew over his mouth the heavy woolen scarf
he wore around his neck

  he rode on a short distance casting
troubled glances into the north he found
himself wondering if davies and harris had
gone to the line camp if they hadnt and
a storm broke the herd on the big level
was in danger

  he brought red king to ahalt the
big horse pranced whistling eagerly he
champed on the bit tossed his head raising
it finally and staring straight into the north

   you see it too eh king said lawler
well we cant take that chance well
have to go to the camp

  he headed red king down into the val-
ley again where the bitter wind did not
strike them riding westward rapidly

  it was noon before lawler and red king
had traveled half the distance to the line
camp a dull gray haze was sweeping
southward it mingled with the southern
light and threw a ghostly glare into the
valley making distance deceptive giving a
strange appearance to the landmarks with
which lawler and the horse were familiar

  lawler increased red kings pace he
saw that the storm was nearer than he had
thought and that he would have to work
fast to get the cattle headed into the valley
before it broke

  the distance from the circle l ranch-
house to the big plain near the line cabin
was about fifteen miles and the trail led
upward in a long tiresome rise yet red
king struck the level with a reserve strength
that was betrayed by the way he fought
for his head as he saw the level stretch be-
fore him he was warmed up-he wanted
to run

  but lawler drew him down in an effort
to locate the herd before he started to-
ward it

  man and horse made a mere blot on the
yawning expanse of land that stretched
away from them in all directions a lone
eagle in the sky or a mariner adrift on a
deserted sea could not have seemed more
isolated than lawler and red king in
this limitless expanse of waste land horse
and rider were dwarfed to the proportions
the trail horde



of atoms the yawning aching stretching
miles of level seemed to have no end

  several miles into the north lawler saw
the herd directly westward at a distance
of about a mile he saw the line cabin no
smoke was issuing from the chimney and
so far as he could discern there were no
men with the cattle

  harris and davies had overstayed that
knowledge might have been responsible for
the grim humor in lawlers eyes but the
rigidness of his body and the aggressive
thrust to his chin were caused by knowl-
edge of a different character the storm
was about to break

  the sun was casting a dull red glow
through the gray haze it was blotted out
as he looked southward from the horizon
ends extended a broad sea of shimmering
glittering sky that contrasted brilliantly
with the black wind-whipped clouds that
had gathered in the north fleecy gray
wisps detached from the heavy spreading
mass northward were scurrying southward
streaking the shimmering brilliance and
telling of the force of the wind that drove
them

  a wailing note came from the north a
sighing vague with a portent of force a
whisper of unrest a promise of fury far
in the north its blackness deepening with
distance stretched the menace arousing
awe with its magnitude

  nature seemed to know what impended
for on the vast level where the storm would
have a clear sweep the dried grass bronzed
by the searing autumn sun was rustling as
it bent far southward the hardy sage bowed
reluctantly to the fitful blasts and the
scraggly ugly yucca resentfully yielded to
the unseen force

  a wide shallow gully ran northwestward
from a point near red king almost in a
straight line toward the herd lawler urged
the big horse into the gully and rode hard
the distance was several miles but when
red king came to the gully end he flashed
out of it like a streak of red flame he
was drawn down instantly however snort-
ing and pawing impatiently while lawler
shielded his eyes with his hands and again
scanned the country

  he saw the herd and as he watched it

began to move there were no men near
the cattle

  they started slowly seeming reluctant
to leave the level they moved sullenly
closely massed their heads lowered their
tails drooping the wind now beginning
to carry a vicious note with its whine drove
a heavy dust cloud against them warning
them

  the wind was icy giving the cattle a
foretaste of what was ts come and min-
gling with the dust were fine flinty snow
particles that came almost horizontally
against their rumps stinging them worry-
ing them they increased their pace and
soon were running with a swinging awk-
ward stride straight toward the wire fence
several miles distant

  if they saw lawler they gave no sign
for they went lumbering ori snorting and
bawling their apprehension

  lawler was about to start red king to-
ward them when he noted movement on
the level a little northwestward from the
cattle peering intently he saw two horse-
men racing southward a little distance
ahead of the cattle paralleling them

  at first lawler was certain the men were
davies and harris and he smiled appre-
ciating their devotion to duty but when
he saw them race past the cattle not even
halting to head them in the right direction
-which would have been slightly eastward
so that they would enter the valley before
reaching the fence-he frowned wheeled
red king sharply and sent him back into
the gully from which he had emerged

   theyre strangers king he said
shortly to the horse as the latter fled head-
long down the gully toward the point from
which he had started  davies and harris
wouldnt leave the herd with that norther
coming on

  the big horse made fast time down the
gully he brought lawler to a point near
the fence where it crossed the gully at about
the instant the two riders were dismounting
some distance away

  lawler rode out of the gully and brought
red king to a halt there was no danger
that the two men would discover him for
all objects in the vicinity were rapidly being
blotted out by the dancing smother of dust


the argosy

that was riding the north wind lawler was
to the north of the men slightly eastward
and they could not have faced the smother
of dust to look toward him

  lawler could dimly see the herd movkg
toward the fence he could see the men
plainly and as he watched them his eyes
narrowed the big horse leaped with the
word he caught from his riders lips racing
lightly with the wind toward the fence
where the men were working

  lawlers approach was noiseless for all
sound was engulfed in the steady roaring
whine of the storm neither of the two
men working at the fence heard lawler
as he brought the big horse to a halt within
half a dozen paces of them

  the taller of the two plying a pair of
wire-nippers completed his work at a fence
post and turned to leap toward another
the movement brought him against the
muzzle of lawlers horse he halted jerkily
retreated a step and looked up to see law-
ler looking at him from behind the muzzle
of the big pistol that had leaped into his
hand

  there was no word spoken-none could
be heard at the moment what followed
was grim pantomime with tragedy lurking
near

  the tall man held his position he had
tentatively extended his right hand the
fingers spread clawlike now the hand was
going upward accompanied by the other

  when the man had stepped backward to
escape a collision with lawlers horse the
wind had whipped his hat from his head
he now stood there his hair waving to the
vicious whims of the gale veiling his eyes
and he not daring to lower his hands to
brush it away

  the shorter man too had assumed a
statuesque pose he had turned when he
had noted his companions startled move-
ment and he too had seen an apparition
that had sent his hands swiftly upward

  the big horse stood motionless his back
to the wind he did not move as lawler
leaped from his back-smoothly quickly
his eyes alert his muscles tensed for violent
action

  the men stood rigid while lawler jerked
their pistols from their holsters and tossed

them into the dust waves that danced and
swirled around them the short man was
catapulted against the tall one with a vi-
ciousness that staggered both and then
they heard lawlers voice sharp and pene-
trating above the shrieking of the wind

    those cattle will be here in five min-
 utes if you dont have that fence repaired
 before then you drift with them hoofing
 it

   in the allotted time they repaired the
 fence working with breathless energy
 while lawler stood near the menacing gun
 in hand a saturnine smile wreathing his
 face

   when the herd reached the fence there
 was no break in it more-where the break
 had been were three men on horses who
 took instant charge easing the cattle down
  along the fence heading them eastward to-
 ward the shelter they were sure to find if
 they kept going

   the three men followed the cattle for a
 mile-until they were going straight and
 fast toward the home ranch then lawler
 smiling with bitter humor motioned the
 men toward the back trail

  they seemed to know what was de-
manded of them they wheeled their
horses sending them into the billowy white
smother that was now coming in a gigantic
wave toward them

   the southern light had gone a dense
 blackness out of which roared a gale that
 robbed them of their breath descended
 the snow was hurled against them like a
 sand blast biting deep stinging their faces
 and blinding them

   it took them more than an hour to travel
 the distance that lay between the point at
 which they had cut the fence and the line
 cabin and when they reached a wind-
 break near the structure the two men rode
 behind it silent thankful

   lawler had ridden forth prepared for
 bad weather his face was now muffled in
 f huge scarf that encircled his neck and his
 eyes were shielded by the peak of the fur
 cap he wore he dismounted waved the
 men toward a dugout and watched them
 as they dismounted and led their horses
 through a narrow door when the men
 emerged lawler led the big red horse in
the trail horde



leaving the men to stand in the white gale
that enveloped them

  the wind was now roaring steadily and
with such force that no man could have
turned toward it with uncovered face it
came over the vast emptiness of the north-
ern spaces with a fury that sent into one
the consciousness that here was an element
with which man could not cope

  lawler emerged from the dugout and
closed the door behind him he barred it
turned and motioned the two men toward
the cabin he followed them as they opened
the door and entered then after closing
the door and barring it he lifted the peak
of his cap removed the scarf from his neck
glanced around the interior of the cabin
and looked coldly at the men

   well he said  theres a heap of ex-
plaining to be done you can begin now-
one at a time

chapter xvii

the inquisition

the two men had walked to a point near
the big fireplace that occupied the great-
er part of one end of the cabin the hat-
less one big assertive belligerent grinned
defiantly saying nothing in answer to law-
lers words

  the other man slighter and plainly ap-
prehensive glanced swiftly at his compan-
ion then lowered his eyes and gazed at the
floor

  you skunks bunked here last night
charged lawler sharply  when i was
here yesterday these bunks were made up
look at them now talk fast were you
here last night

  the smaller man nodded

   why didnt you cut the fence iasi
night

  the smaller man grinned  we wasnt
aimin to get caught

   expected thered be line riders here
eh 

  the other did not answer

   then when you saw no one was here
and that it was likely the norther would
keep any one from coming you cut the
fence thats it eh

    	argosy

  the two men did not answer regarding
him sullenly

  lawler smiled this time there was a
cold mirth in his smile that caused the two
men to look quickly at each other they
paled and scowled at what they saw in
lawlers eyes

  half a dozen bunks ranged the side walls
of the cabin four on one side two on the
other arranged in tiers upper and lower
a rough square table st near the center
of the room with a low bench on one side
of it and several low chairs on the other a
big chuck-box stood in a corner near the
fireplace its top half open revealing the
supplies with which the receptacle was
filled some shelves on the other side of the
fireplace were piled high with canned goods
and bulging packages the bunks were
filled with bed clothing  and an oil-lamp
stood on a triangular shelf in a corner near
the door the walls were bare with the ex-
ception of some highly-colored lithographs
that evidently had been  placed there by
some one in whom the love of art still
flourished

  it was cold in the cabin a window in
the north wall with four small panes of
glass in it was slowly whitening with the
frost that was stealing over it in the cor-
ners of the mullions were fine snow drifts
and through a small crevice in the roof a
white spray filtered ballooning around the
room

  during the silence which followed law-
lers words and while the two fence-cutters
watched each other and lawler all caught
the voice of the storm raging furious in-
cessant

  with his free hand lawler unbuttoned
his coat tossed his cap into a bunk and
ran a hand through his hair shoving it back
from his forehead his movements were
deliberate it was as though catching fence
cutters was an occupation of every-day oc-
currence

  yet something in his eyes-the thing
the two men had seen-gave the lie to the
atmosphere of deliberate ease that radiated
from him in his eyes was something that
warned that hinted of passion

as the men watched him noting his mus-
cular neck and shoulders the slim waist of


the argosy

him the set of his head-which had that
hint of conscious strength both mental and
physical which clearly marks the intelligent
fighter-they shrank a little glowering sul-
lenly

  lawler stood close to the door the pistol
danglihg from his right hand he had
hooked the thumb of the left hand into his
cartridge belt and his eyes were gleaming
with feline humor

   theres a heap to be told he said
 im listening

  a silence followed his words both men
moistened their lips neither spoke

  get going commanded lawler

   we was headin south said the small
man  we cut the fence to git through

  lawlers eyelids flickered slightly the
heavy pistol swung upward until the dark
tube gaped somberly into the small mans
eyes

   ive got loads of time but i dont feel
like wasting it said lawler  youve got
one minute to come clean keep your traps
shut for that time and i bore you-both-
and chuck you outside

  his smile might have misled some men
but the small man had correctly valued
lawler

   gary warden hired us to cut the
fence

  the mans voice was a placative whine
his furtive eyes swept lawlers face for
signs of emotion

  there were no signs lawlers face
might have been an expressionless mask
not a muscle of his body moved the of-
fense was a monstrous one in the ethics of
the cow-country and the fence-cutter had
a right to expect lawler to exhibit passion
of some kind

   gary warden eh lawler laughed
quietly  if youre lying-

  the man protested that he was telling the
truth

  at this point the tall man sneered

   hell he said  quit your damn blab-
bin 

   yes grinned lawler speaking to the
small man  youre quitting your talk
from now on your friend is going to do it
im asking questions a heap rapid and the
answers are going to jump right onto the

  tails of the questions if they dont im
going to see how near i can come to boring
a hole in the place where youve got your
brains cached

  the man glared malignantly at lawler
but when the first question came it was an-
swered instantly

   how much did warden pay you

   a hundred dollars

   when were you to cut the fence

   when the norther struck 

   you saw us cache grub in the cabin
  the man nodded

   what if you had found a couple of
line riders here what were you told to do
if you found line riders here im wanting
the truth-all of it

  the man hesitated lawlers pistol
roared the concussion rocking the air of the
cabin the man staggered back clapping
a hand to his head where it seemed to
him the bullet from the pistol had been
aimed

  the man brought up against the rear wall
of the cabin beside the fireplace and he
leaned against it his face ghastly with
fright his lips working soundlessly the
little man cowered plainly expecting law-
ler would shoot him too and lawlers
gun did swing up again menacingly but
the voice of the tall man came blurting
out the reply

   warden told us to knife any men we
found here

  lawlers lips straightened and his eyes
glowed with a passion so intense that the
men shrank gibbering in the grip of a
mighty paralysis

  lawler walked to the table and sat be-
side it placing the gun near his right hand
the men watched him fascinated noting
his swift movements as he plunged a hand
into a pocket and drew out a small pad of
paper and a pencil he wrote rapidly upon
a leaf of the pad then got up stepped back
and ordered the tall man to approach the
table

   write your name below what i have
written-and date it

  when both men had signed the paper
lawler folded it stuck it between some
leaves of the pad and replaced pad and
pencil in the pocket
the trail horde



   thats all he said  youll hang out
here until the norther blows itself out
then youll hit the trail to town and tell
your story to the sheriff ill be doing the
honors

  he sheathed his gun and flung open the
door stepping back as a white avalanche
rushed in grinning broadly as he saw the
men shrink from it he divined that the
men though he was going to force them out
into the storm immediately and he grinned
coldly

  you can be tickled that im not sending
you out into it to drift with the cattle you
tried to kill he said  youd deserve that
plenty youll find wood beside the dug-
out get some of it in here and start a fire
move and dont try any monkey busi-
ness

  he closed the door as the men went out
he had no fear that they would try to
escape - even a threat of instant death
could not have forced them to leave the
cabin now

  when they came in they kindled a fire in
the big fireplace hovering close to it after
the blaze sprang up enjoyjng its warmth
for the interior of the cabin had become
frigid

  lawler however did not permit the men
to enjoy the fire he sent them out for
more wood and when they had piled a
goodly supply in a corner and had filled a
tin water-pail from a water hole situated
about a hundred feet straight out from the
door of the cabin he sent them again on a
message to the dugout to get their ropes

  with the ropes despite the sullen objec-
tions of the men he bound their hands and
feet tightly afterward picking the men up
and tossing them ungently into upper bunks
on opposite sides of the room

  he stood after watching them for a
time grinning coldly

   thats just so you wont get to thinking
you are company he said  were holed
up for a long time maybe and i dont want
you to bother me a heap if you get to
bothering me-disturbing my sleep trying
to untangle yourselves from those ropes
why-

  he significantly tapped his pistol then
he pulled a chair close to the fire dropped

into it rolled a cigarette and calmly
smoked watching the white fleece trail up
the chimney

chapter xviii

the knocking at the door

jr an hour there was no sound in the
cabin lawler smoked several cigarettes
once he got up and threw more wood upon
the fire standing in front of the blaze for
several minutes stretching his long legs
watching the licking tongues as they were
sucked up the chimney by the shrieking
wind

   then for a time he lounged in the chair
gazing meditatively at the north window
noting how the fine frozen snow meal clung
to the glass watching the light fade listen-
ing to the howling white terror that had
seized the world in its icy grip

  at the end of an hour it grew dark in
the cabin lawler got up lighted the kero-
sene-lamp placed it on the table seated
himself on a bench and again resumed
meditatively watching the leaping flames in
the fireplace

  satisfaction glowed in his eyes as he
thought of what would have happened had
he not decided to substitute for davies and
harris undoubtedly by this time the two
men were on their way to the camp they
would certainly have noticed the warning
black northern sky and other indications
of the coming storm and undoubtedly if
they had started toward the camp they
were by this time being punished for their
dereliction

  they would make the camp though he
was sure for they had the wind at their
backs and they knew the trail he ex-
pected any minute to hear them at the
door

  he grinned his face a trifle grim as
he anticipated their astonishment at finding
him there with the two fence-cutters oc-
cupying the bunks

  he had not followed the herd to the cir-
cle l shelters because he had had small hope
of keeping close to the fence-cutters in the
storm and he had brought them back to
the cabin to make sure of them as he sat


the argosy

at the table he drew out the paper the men
had signed and read their names

   lay givens

   ben link

  their confession would convict gary
warden of a crime that-if it did not open
the doors of the penitentiary to him-would
bring upon him the condemnation of every
honest man in the state in his anxiety to
inflict damage upon lawler warden had
overstepped himself

  lawler had betrayed no passion that day
when he had got off the train at willets
with his men and blondy antrim he had
not permitted any of them to suspect that
the incident of the attempted theft of a por-
tion of the trail herd had affected him

  but it had affected him it had aroused
him as he had never been aroused before
it had filled him with a passionate hatred
of gary warden so intense that when his
thoughts dwelt upon the man he felt a lust
to destroy him not even lafe corwin
watching him that day at willets knew how
he had fought to overcome the driving de-
sire to kill warden singleton and antrim
as they had stood there on the platform

  his eyes chilled now as he thought of
warden and the others he got up his
blood pulsing heavily and started toward
the fire he had reached it and was stand-
ing before it when he heard a sound at the
door-a faint knocking and a voice

  davies and harris were coming now
they were cold he supposed had seen the
light in the window-perhaps had tried the
door the wind drowning the noise so that
he had not heard it before they were in
a hurry to get in to the warmth the cabin
afforded

  he was in no hurry to let them in and
he walked deliberately to the table and
stood beside it his back to the fire smiling

  he heard no further sound and he sup-
posed the men had gone to the dugout to
turn their horses into its shelter before
again trying the door

  he was in a grimly humorous mood now
and he stooped blew out the light and
stepped toward the door standing back of
it where it would swing against him when
the men opened it

  he loosened the fastenings stealthily
he wanted them to come in and find the
two fence-cutters there

  he stood for a long time at the door
listening waiting no sound reached his
ears and he scowled puzzled then above
the wailing voice of the storm came the
shrill piercing neigh of a horse

  several times in his life had lawler heard
that sound-once when a cow-pony which
had been bogged down in quicksand had
neighed when she had been drawn under
and again when a horse which he had been
riding had stepped into a gopher hole and
had broken a leg he had been forced to
shoot the animal for which he had formed
a sincere attachment and it had seemed to
him that when he drew the pistol the horse
knew what impended-for its shrill neigh
had been almost human in its terrible ap-
peal

  it was such a sound that now reached his
ears above the roar of the storm

  davies and harris were in trouble

  with a bound lawler tore the door open
and stood leaning against the terrific wind
trying to peer out into the white smother
that shrieked around him when he made
out the outlines of a horse not more than
half a dozen feet from the open doorway-
the animal so encrusted with snow that he
looked like a pallid ghost-and a shapeless
bundle on his back that was seemingly
ready to pitch into a huge drift that had
formed in front of the cabin-he leaped
outward a groan of sympathy breaking
from him

  in an instant he was inside again carry-
ing the shapeless bundle his lips stiff and
white as he peered close at it as he tenderly
laid it on the floor of the cabin

  with swift movements he lighted the
lamp again and then returning to the bun-
dle leaned over it pulling away a scarf
that covered its head and disclosing a white
drawn face-the face of the woman he had
met in willets at the foot of the stairs
leading to gary wardens office 

  lawler wheeled swiftly leaping to first
one and then to the other of the bunks
where the fence-cutters lay tearing the
ropes from them

  the tall man tumbled out first urged by
the trail horde



what he had seen and by the low tense
voice of his captor he seized a tin-pan
and dove out of the open doorway return-
ing instantly the pan heaped high with
snow the other man following the first
quickly dove through the snow-drifts to
the dugout where he fumbled in the slicker
on lawlers saddle until he found a flask

  by the time the little man returned- the
woman was in one of the lower bunks a
pair of bare feet small and shapely were
sticking out over the edge of the bunk and
the tall fence-cutter was vigorously rubbing
snow over them a pair of small high-top
riding boots of soft pliable leather was
lying beside the bunk near some pitiably
thin stockings

  at the other end of the bunk lawler was
bathing with ineffable tenderness and care
a face that had been swathed in the scarf
he had previously removed the long
glistening black hair had been brushed back
from its owners forehead by lawler and
a corner of a blanket had been modestly
folded over a patch of white breast ex-
posed when lawler had ruthlessly torn
away the flimsy fluffy waist

   it was the scarf that saved her face
said lawler after he had worked over the
unconscious form for a quarter of an hour
the face was flushed now-which was a
good sign and the feet and ankles were
beginning to show signs of restored circula-
tion also-though more reluctantly

   how she ever got through it im not
pretending to say declared lawler grimly
 but she did it and the frost didnt get
her much shell be fresh as a daisy in a
couple erf hours

  the tall man - link--had ceased ms
labors with the woman and was standing
near lawler he grinned at lawlers words

  his face was flushed his eyes were glow-
ing with passion as he watched the inert
form on the bunk

   shes a peach he said thickly law-
ler was not looking at him he was giving
all his attention to the woman

   della wharton continued link ive
seen her at the two diamond - runnin
around with warden wardens took a
shine to her dont blame him

did not hear for lawler was paying no at-
tention to him

  lawler held the flask to the womans
half-open mouth aad smiled when several
drops of the strong spirits trickled over her
tongue then he walked to the wood-pile
and replenished the fire returning he
saw link standing close to the bunk smil-
ing bestially at the upturned face when
lawler caught sight of him he was finger-
ing the disordered hair effing it and letting
it filter through his fingers

  without a word lawler leaped and
struck with bitter malignance not a sound
escaped link as he fell lawler lifted him
bodily threw him upon the pile of wood in
the comer whore he lay huddled up un-
conscious

  wheeling swiftly his eyes ablaze with the
terrible passion that had seized him law-
ler faced the bunk the womans head
was moving slowly from side to side as
though she were making an effort to eft it
her eyelid were fluttering and her hands
were straying over the bed clothing the
fingers closing and unclosing

  lawler made a horrible grimace at
givens

   get out of here damn you  he said
 go out and take care of her horse-any-
thing if you are in here when she wakes
up ill kill you and take that other skunk
out of here too-take him to the dugout
and dont come back here for an hour

  he watched impatiently while givens
seized his companion and dragged him out-
side then lawler fastened the door and
standing near it watched the woman

  her eyes were open he could see them
even though he stood seghtly behind her
she moved her head lifted it and gazed
around the roan seemingly bewildered at
what die saw then she twisted her body
around saw her bare feet and quickly
drew an end of the bunk blanket over them

  and then she saw lawler her eyes
opened wide filling with satisfaction and
she sat up holding one hand to her throat
tight against the flesh covering it with the
other

   oh  she said thinly  i-i got here
didnt i but i didnt expect to find you
here 

 he muttered something else that lawler

the sharp trill of the telephone startled
howard selfridge out of his vacuous
lethargy for long minutes he had
gazed emptily rather wearily into nothing-
ness at intervals his face was screwed up
with pain and he pressed his two hands
against his head to still the hammering in
his temples soft white hands they were
and they trembled dissipatedly the bell
broke in on one of these periods of groan-
ing torpor and selfridges eyes opened
again and he looked round at each of the
luxurious furnishings of his room in turn
with an expression of peevish bitterness on
his face

  it might have been a fine face under
other circumstances the eyes were wide
apart and intelligent-in spite of their pres-
ent bleariness the nose was finely chis-
eled the lips were full and firm and the
whole showed the possibility of an imagina-
tion which might have accomplished things
but it was a soft face and bloodless and
the lines which seamed it were lines of dis-
sipation and disillusionment and of weary
cynicism

  again the bell reminded him he grum-
bled discontent and without rising from his
deep chair he reached out a shaky hand
to a decanter on the table beside him to
pour himself a bracer for the necessary

energy to answer it he turned the de-
canter upside down over a tumbler and for
long seconds he watched the last amber
drops trickle from the thin neck with a
twisted smile of satirical introspection

  then suddenly he gripped the bottle in
a spasm of passion as a convulsion of rage
flushed his pale face he leaped to his
feet and crashed the costly glass into the
empty fireplace

  damn dickie anyhow he swore vi-
ciously  i knew he was a fool sure tip
hell any stock that he boosted was bound
to slump curse it id never have in-
vested only margie giggled and said i was
no sport and i was pickled to the gills
once again the bell jarred imperiously
on his jangled nerves this time he stag-
gered painfully to the instrument and lis-
tened at the receiver an appreciable time
elapsed before he seemed to understand the
message the operator had to repeat then
he groaned

   oh thunder tell her im not in
there followed an awkward pause then
he distinguished the cautious buzzing of the
wire-or was it his head

   standin right heah suh she done
heard me talkin to you suh

  selfridge hung over the instrument help-
lessly all he could think of was

   oh lord tell her that-oh hell

   then the voice again

 

if gordon mac creak
the high flier



   she cornin right up suh

  selfridge was standing by the mantle-
shelf when the girl burst into the room with
eager impulsiveness then she stopped
rigid in her gesture of greeting his half-
formed name frozen on her lips

  she had never seen him this way before
she had heard of his prodigal gaieties and
she had seen him  sick but not like this
her eyes opened slowly wide and the level
brows above them corrugated in an expres-
sion of incredulous surprise and sorrow
rather than reproach fine eyes they were
wide-set and thoughtful with a wistfulness
in them which came of much grieving and
wondering-and waiting silent suppressed
emotions which inevitably mold softness
yet the lips when they closed with a tremu-
lous intake of the breath were firmly curved
and the rounded chin was full of decision

  she wore  something in a russet-brown
which matched her hair selfridge never
knew what these things were made of or
how he was conscious only that it looked
well and quiet and wonderfully appropriate

  it was abundantly clear that this girl was
not never could be by the most distorted
fancy mixed up with the margie who had
giggled when he was pickled to the gills
selfridge stood leaning weakly against the
mantle looking at her in dull silence in
which humiliation was evenly balanced with
irritation the girl was the first to find
her voice instead of bursting into re-
proachful reference to his appearance she
faltered stammered and managed to ar-
ticulate 

   howard i-i heard that you had-had
been unfortunate again so i-well i
came

  self ridges reply was irrelevant

  you shouldnt have come grace-not
here

  instantly the rounded chin was ready for
battle

   why not she demanded defensively
knowing full well the answer in advance

  selfridge subsided wearily into a chair
and told her the conventional law in a dis-
passione voice

   if anybody were to see you it might he
unpleasant-for you

  the girl was wilfully defiant

   i dont care i-i heard that you had
-that you were cleaned out and i knew
that you needed m- she was about to
say me but she bit her lip on her impulsive-
ness and altered the sentence lamely to

 you needed somebody to help

  selfridge winced but said nothing he
sat hunched in the chair staring dully
ahead the girl came swiftly into the room
and stood by his side her feeling of awk-
wardness in the situation evinced by the 
helpless littfe movement of her fingers play-
ing with her dress it was difficult to know
just what to say so poor howard
she murmured

  there was the sheer woman of it all
his present plight all his past criminal fool-
ishness all his neglect were glossed over
the only emotion she was aware of was
sympathy

   poor howard what do you propose
to do now

  howard proposed nothing he had been
in no condition to think of anything he
just shrugged at the outlook therefore the
girl offered a hopeless suggestion

   couldnt you go back to your uncle
stanley-just for a while till you could get
something to do

  at last selfridge spoke he laughed
rather a laugh of the ultimate ridicule

   pshaw uncle stanley you know
what my uncle thinks of me grace and
you can just imagine what hed say if i
went to him looking for room and board 

-his face turned stubborn- not in a mil-
lion years i wouldnt darn him hed read
the bible at me

  the girl nodded she had listened to
that stout methodists views on his scape-
grace nephew on more than one occasion
when she had dropped in while howard
was still at home and found the old man
alone-always alone

   well then what about your friends
she suggested

  howards sudden cackle was satanic v
 ha-aa-a that bunch you know
those boys-you dont though and thats
your good luck i could borrow just about
ten dollars from one of them and then
theyd stake me to dinners-as long as my
clothes lasted


the argosy

   well what are you going to do then
howard she was insistent and he felt
that she was driving him into some definite
blind alley but he was too utterly soul-
weary and heavy-headed to conjecture
about it

   oh good lord grace how should i
knew what im going to do ill get some
one to sell all this stuff for me i suppose-
my private cellarette ought to letch some-
thing these days and then-well i sup-
pose ill get a job of some sort

   what kind of a job howard what
can you do she fenced him yet closer

  selfridge had a very clear-cut picture of
just what he could do it was an easy
picture to visualize the keen imagination
betokened in his forehead and eyes showed
him a long vista of grim grayness stretching
ahead of him drab days during which the
crease in his coats and pants gradually dis-
solved into dissolute bagginess and pro-
gressed thence to hard-worn shininess and
finally disintegrated to the ultimate frayed
thread hideous days to contemplate and
colorless nights of unbroken monotony in
which the only laughter would be that of
people who passed in automobiles and the
only lights would be the white arcs gleam-
ing coldly on park benches his laugh
was the fulfilment of the twisted bitter-
tasting smile

   what can i do might have got a
sweet job mixing drinks-a little while ago
but now-oh ive never thought about it
but i suppose i can do something

  the girl pressed her concerted plan yet
further

   what is something howard you
know you have no training

  howard was silent he knew his limita-
tions better than she did he shuddered
suddenly and put his hands over his face
that was to shut out the grim prospect
which his malicious imagination conjured
up he was afraid of it the competing
with other men for work the battle for
existence appalled him he had never had
to develop self-reliance the only asser-
tion he had ever known had been his readi-
ness to order-and pay the bill

  that keen imagination of his showed him
in hideous pictures how he would shrink in

the competition with men in an open field
the only competition he had met hitherto
had been a riotous rivalry with vacuous
young men to be known as the wildest high-
est flier of them all in that sort of com-
petition he had succeeded gloriously he
had flown high-and he had crashed and
now he was afraid deadly afraid he sat
therefore with his hands before his eyes
and there was no smile on his face

  the girl swayed over him yearning to do
something she did not know what but
just hungering to comfort and help it was
the instinctive mother yearning over the
weakness which is the weakness of a child
a phenomenon which leaves strong men in
amaze and indignant fury her fingers
touched his hair ever so lightly

  poor howard she murmured again
and then-she had driven him now against
the final wall-diffidently yet with set de-
termination she made her final point
 howard you know that i have a little-
seme negotiable securities so i -the rest
came with a rush- wont you take them to
carry yourself with till you can make some
connections

  the startling suddenness of this offer
from this direction struck howard with gal-
vanic effect he lurched almost reeled
from under the girls protective influence

   good heavens grace dont talk that
way he muttered almost fearfully  of
course i couldnt its--its awfully decent
of you of course but-good lord i
havent got there yet 

  he strode several times up and down the
room plucking nervously at his fingers
locked behind his back then

   grace you ought to be going now if
some one were to come you know-really
you mustnt stay

  the girl made another effort to reason
with him or rather to urge the age-old
argument of why not but he almost ran
from her with a hunted expression in his
eyes she saw that she would have to re-
linquish her plan for the present at any
rate she sighed then but she was only
postponing matters till a more auspicious
occasion when his need might be more im-
minent and his nerves less shaken he
must communicate with her of course as
the high flier



soon as he had made any other arrange-
ments for a less exorbitant scale of living
with feminine practical economy she urged
that he lose no time

   of course he said and  sure he
would and he piloted her to the door
once more she gave him implicit directions
of just how he should proceed once more
her eyes softened with yearning and then
she went looking back and waving bravely
as the elevator shot down

  selfridge sat down weakly and dabbed
with a handkerchief at his brow

   phe-ew he murmured  gee whizz
that was a bad one nearly a knockout
by golly when they begin to assume that
air of proprietorship its time to slide from
under

   he remained supine for a long time his
hands in his pockets and his long legs trail-
ing out in front his expression was
thoughtfully serious half frightened still
an expression of long and sober review of
the past and of shuddering forecast of the
future finally he gathered his legs stiffly
under him rose painfully to his feet and
dabbed a shaky key at the lock of a ma-
hogany sideboard

  gosh he murmured and gee
whizz again as he poured a stiff bracer
for himself  grace is a bully fellow and
an awfully good girl and all that but-
thunder-who wants to be tied to a good
girl for life

  one of the inexplicable enigmas of ex-
istence is why a good girl should so often
want to be tied to a worthless man for life

ii

  exactly twenty-eight days had passed
and selfridges keen imagination had proved
itself to be a prophet of horrid accuracy
gray days they had been from the first
for selfridge had moved out of his luxuri-
ous home at once not so much from a
sense of economy as from a sense of pride
he was afraid that some of his friends
might look in while the memory of joyous
nights was yet new and he shrank from
the attendant humiliation he was quite
sure too that the girl would come again
and he was afraid of her-and of himself

if his prophetic imagination had erred

at all it was in defining just how black
a gray day might be when it had been
preceded by seven others or by fourteen
or by twenty-one selfridge had never be-
fore thought of days in periods of sevens
but three times already a drab woman as
gray and monotonous as the days she count-
ed with such dull avarice had appeared
before him and demanded money for his
privilege of occupying a thin coffin of a
room at the head of a cfmgy flight of stairs
which were as dark by day as they were
by night to-day selfridge knew that she
would appear again and demand more
money for a further lease of the malignant
number seven-and he had been afraid to
meet even her this morning he had got
up early therefore earlier even than the
woman whose practise it was to emulate the
early bird and he stood now in a line
with other men who wore overalls and car-
ried tin pails or some of them packages
under their arms greasy packages sugges-
tive of food

  it conveyed the impression that these
men hoped to go to work the same day it
was a comforting impression that did much
to counterbalance the repugnance with
which he had forced himself to consider
this new type of advertisement hitherto
he had haunted offices which advertised
 see mr smith after  am this other
which said tersely  bring your tools was
a grievous come-down but selfridge had
acquired a new and very definite concep-
tion of the potence of the mystic number
seven

   in due time selfridge having filled out-
or rather made empty dashes in-an appli-
cation form in an outer office found himself
standing before a wiry little man who sat
at a desk and scribbled his name on slips
of paper which bore printed captions such
as sub-assembly dope wiring he looked
selfridge over with quick ferrety eyes
twenty-eight days ago he would have said

 nothing doing brother youre in the
wrong shop but to-day selfridge looked
quite a lot different from the wreck of three
weeks ago his face for one thing was a
lot browner-even the sparse sunlight of
city streets will have some effect if one ven-
tures into them by day  and his hand was


the argosy

steadier and to-day oddly enough under
the spell of the impending seven his atti-
tude was not quite so diffidently apologetic

  the man grunted there and snapped
f ever done anything in aircraft before
it was quite evident that he had never
looked at the application-blank what he
looked at was men

   no said selfridge without following
up with his usual  but et cetera et
cetera two days ago he would have pro-
duced his well-worn diploma-and would
have immediately killed his chance em-
ployers have a nasty habit of insisting that
 theres a reason  for broken-down college
men the alert little man surprised him

   good most of em claim that -theyre
expert mechanics at least with an army
training-and i fire em in this shop we
work what can you do

   anyth- selfridge began and then he
caught the look that  was starting into the
others eyes and altered his reply to i
have no experience in manufacture

  the man looked at him sharply and
grunted  huh i dont like that high-brow
accent of yours for two cents but the na-
tional will give anybody a chance could
you -he looked at selfridge and grinned
shrewdly- do you know how to use
dope

   no said selfridge quite innocently
the man grinned again  h-m i guess
youre telling the truth if dope had been
your trouble youd have fallen for that
all right he scribbled on a slip  re-
port to scudder dope section hell show
you how to use it twenty a week

  that was all there was no inquiry as
to whether the figure would suit the
quick-eyed psychologist at the desk sized
up his applicants as he spoke to them-and
he always knew to an exact nicety just how
badly they needed employment

  selfridge took his slip to scudder feeling
an elation which he had not known since
his misfortune as a matter of fact he
had never felt such a real satisfaction in
his life before he had never known the
need of success

  scudder looked him over with scant ap-
proval he took the slip which consigned
selfridge to his care and growled

   h-m another of mitchells experi-
ments i suppose and he set selfridge to
painting wings this was not a compli-
ment for it meant that selfridge in his
opinion did not have sense enough to apply
dope to fabric

  selfridge then at last had what he had
never hoped to have in his life-a job

  for torturing ages thereafter it seemed
to him-that he toiled with a breaking back
and raw hands directing a fine spray of
liquid color through an air pressure  paint
gun  against acres and miles of wing sur-
faces yet he dared not stop or slack down
for he saw men older than himself mostly
and even more anaemic shirking now and
then and presently they did not come any
more the thought of not coming any
more to this loathed occupation filled sel-
fridge with cold horror for the insistent wo-
man and the alternative fear of the outer
dark were very present menaces

  he toiled with feverish steadiness then
and his life was a hazy mist tof gray paint
and acres of gray wings and ages of gray
days though as a matter of fact he saw
the grim woman who reckoned days by
sevens but twice during that time and
presently his back ached less and he began
to feel the airbrush nozzle as something
other than a piece of red-hot metal and he
found himself doing almost as well as some
of the girls who worked by his side in
overalls and just about then he was sud-
denly transferred to the dope-room

  selfridge did not recognize the compli-
ment he worked in the forced draft of
the dope-room for nearly half a day and
then he went out and deathly sick-and
then he quit two weeks ago he would
have toiled on in terror and would have
died but two weeks of  experience  at a
definite profession gave him a wonderful
confidence he went to scudder and told
him flatly that the fumes of that acetate
were too much for him and that was
straight goods

  scudder looked at him searchingly for a
minute then he said  all right knock
off and call it a day ill see mitchell about
shifting you

  this in itself was amazing as a shrill-
voiced girl remarked pithily to another be-
the high flier



tween rapid mastications of gum  holy
jiminy t id have fallen down on me
job thataway id a bin fired that quick
but to mitchell scudder said  i dont
quite make that guy he aint got a hell
of a lot of steam to him but then he dont
waste no extra time fooling around with the
janes

  which was true for one thing sel-
fridge had not dared to steal time for sur-
reptitious horse-play with the by no means
frail sharers of his labor and for another--
well he had acquired during his years of
affluence a certain very definitely developed
taste and these girls were neither in speech
nor in manner nor in looks anything like
margie nor were they by any means any-
thing at all like grace he thought in
passing comparison of grace and he
thought of his promise to write and com-
municate his whereabouts but that
thought too was no more than passing
and hastily dismissed as quite obviously
not to be considered

   mitchell smiled thinly at scudder and
agreed  i dont quite make him myself
but he looked like a man who wanted a
job bad enough to stick you say hes not
as thick as some well ill put him in sub-
assembly on fabric

   selfridge then instead of being fired
was promoted he went to a department
vhere the thin skeletons of wings came in
all their nakedness and he learned to
stretch fine linen over them acres of linen
he stretched and tacked down with infinite
care and he shuddered as he regarded the
frail structures which he covered his im-
agination freed-or perhaps rather jaded-
from visualizing for him scenes of his own
unpleasant prospects turned with a mys-
terious fascination to picturing gruesome
collapses of these spidery compositions of
wood and cloth and paint in every conceiv-
able sort of circumstance in their naked-
ness he could see-his mechanical training
helped him-just where the weaknesses lay
and he pictured them suddenly doubling
up thousands of feet in the air and whirling
down to spectacular destruction his im-
agination dwelt with morbid fascination on
the emotions of the occupants during the
appreciable interval of hopeless certitude

   but it was a cheerfully impersonal sort of
picture show this time it was no affair of
his he would never have to trust his
life to his own skill and care and to the
care of his fellows the very thought oc-
casioned a derisive and at the same time a
fearsome smile

  yet he worked carefully and fast not
that he liked the thought of work any more
-or rather hated it less but because his
imagination still found tiftie every now and
then to remind him of a cold park bench
and though his promotion meant more pay
he never saved anything it meant only
that he ate that much the more suitably
to his taste but he did not drink for
one thing drink was difficult and not very
satisfying and for another he did not dare
if he were to revert to his old condition of
uselessness he would be fired and the con-
sequent picture was unthinkable

  this is no story of a man who has seen
the error of his ways and has resolutely
set himself to conquer the demon rum and
thereafter to raise himself by sheer grit and
determination-spurred by the inspiration
of the pure working-girl who believes in
him-to affluence and respectability sel-
fridge frankly did not see the error of his
ways he worked solely because work
meant better food and a room less soul-
destroying

   as for the demon rum it had never been
for him more than a pleasant accessory to
pleasant company he felt no urge to drink
in company with his fellow workers anv
more than to talk to them the honest-
and sometimes pure-working-girl who held
down her end of the fabric with a lump of
chewing-gum while she skilfully tacked
down the edge afforded him no inspiration
whatever not one of the nobler emotions
fired him he worked because he had com-
mon sense and he could visualize the inevi-
table result of two and two-or of two
minus two and-since man is a creature
of habit-because work came not nearly so
difficult now

  since he had sense however which so
many of his fellow slaves had not he forged
ahead that was the plain result of two
and two in the fabric department he hap-
pened to detect an internal brace wire which


the argosy

was too loose that meant that he had
observation as well as sense he was gradu-
ated to the wire section

  wire work meant more pay-and as a
natural sequence more of the luxuries of
life selfridge smiled to himself that thin
cynical smile he was able to see humor
in the thing that a man entirely un-
worthy as he confessed himself to be who
had no interest in his work and who worked
solely that he might not starve should be
pushed ahead through sheer force of cir-
cumstance was a most pleasing satire on
life

  and then as he chuckled over the thing
the beginnings of a great truth began to
take shape in his mind this tremendous
fact was that a man of educated intelligence
having once acquired the necessary tech-
nique of any manual craft is -bound to rise
by reason of his quicker thinking aparatus

  let some of our forlorn college graduates
whose finest prospect is a  position in busi-
ness apply this axiom to let us say the
plumbing trade and watch themselves be-
come leaders of men

  selfridge realized another and more
patent truth and that was that since the
direct result of work was more pay and
therefore food more suited to his taste and
even cigarsr-not so well suited real ap-
plication might lead once more to the flesh-
pots of egypt that was the beginning of
ambition

  one of the first things that selfridge
did was to move away from the nightmare
of the seventh day advent so imminently
respectable was his new domicil that he
thought for a moment of redeeming his
promise to communicate his whereabouts
to grace grace used to be awfully good
companionship and human companionship
was what he could not find among his
fellow workers but he thought immediate-
ly of his last meeting with grace and he
put the impulse from him with a shiver

  less than a month in the wire department
found selfridge an expert in making loops
in hard wires and soldering eyes into non-
flexible cables and splicing flexible controls
and taking gages and even in applying the
tinius-olsen test he was put into  field

  not long after on the field he was re-

newing a flying wire on a plane and listen-
ing to two mechanicians swear because the
engine would not start they had tried all
the -orthodox tests they had tested spark-
plugs for  juice sweatingly turning the
propeller the while they had poked screw-
drivers into the distributor terminals they
had opened up the breaker-box and ex-
amined minutely the platinum connection
points and they had found nofault yet
there was no current therefore they stood
and blasphemed to high heaven in their
wrath

  selfridge finished his job and gathered
up his tools he was always diffident about
thrusting himself forward among those
rough-spoken men but he made a sugges-
tion over his shoulder

   hows the betting for a cracked bush-
ing in your magneto causing internal
ground

   huh  snorted one of the mechanicians
 whadda you know lineman spose you
show us

  selfridge shrank from their antagonism

   not i he said  i wouldnt know
the inside of one of those things if i saw
it but theoretically that would be the next
step

  the mechanicians looked after him and
swore some more including him in their
objurgations this time

  yet it mas a cracked bushing selfridge
was transferred to  motor he had to
smile quizzically to himself again but he
was beginning to realize that there was
after all some value to his college training
and in motors his inherited aptitude at last
found an interest here was something in
which his fathers spirit was evident in
him he took a real joy in toying with
oily things that revolved and noting how
exactly they fitted and understanding just
why they worked and even theorizing in
a half-formed way how they might be im-
proved

  in motors at last he had found something
in which he did not have to force himself
reluctantly to work he did not by any
means plunge into an orgy of interested ac-
tivity he did not even particularly apply
himself no more than he had done at col-
lege but since he knew the theory already
the high flier



the application of it came easy intelli-
gent application of the two put him once
more into the field force

  only the best motor mechanics get to
field work but selfridge was not entirely
elated over his promotion field men are
sometimes called upon to go up the idea
was unthinkable selfridge had never at
any time been called upon to develop per-
sonal courage his life had been too shel-
tered and now like many factory men
who have seen the apparent frailty of in-
ternal construction and who have a knowl-
edge of aerodynamics to show them just
with what force and where the strains in-
cidental to flying are applied the thought
of trusting his life to one of those things
was a chill of horror

  that diabolical imagination of his treated
him all over again to a vivid picture show
of collapses from vast heights and added
this time the grim  close-up  of himself
as one of the occupants selfridge deter-
mined to apply some real energy and work
out of the field force to motor-tester in the
shop yet in that very application his fate
overtook him

  a military model spad had been con-
verted to the more useful pursuit of mail-
carrying the liberty motor had been re-
placed with a powerful and appallingly
noisy hispano-suiza the observers seat
in front had been ripped out and replaced
with an aluminum grille for holding mail-
bags flying wires and landing wires had
been sounded like banjo-strings to test their
tautness innumerable crown nuts and cot-
ter-pins and safety wires had been ex-
amined and now the great machine stood
ready for its test

  the flight-tester stevens a youth of sub-
lime recklessness as is befitting in one who
takes machines into the air to determine
ahether they are fit to fly sat in the pilots
seat and jerked his controls sharply to try
out their tension selfridge hopped down
from the foot-board of the lower plane and
reported

   all o k with the engine

  stevens looked toward the field superin-
tendent who nodded

   all right the boy called  spin the
stick over shes on

  an assistant of selfridges took the great
propeller in both hands and jerked it down-
ward and to the left it was a compliment
to the engine force that the ignition caught
on at once and the propeller roared its readi-
ness the pilot immediately shut down on
the gas-control and let the motor  idle 
while he settled himself and tested his  joy-
stick  again once or twice for a few
seconds at a time he  gave her the gun 
and let the engine race while he watched
his instruments suddenly he threw up his
hand

   hey the tachometer dont register

  the tachometer is an instrument which
is connected with the cam-shaft of the en-
gine and registers the revolutions per minute
of the propeller selfridge jumped up
abashed to the dash-board and examined
the instrument in a moment he found that
it had been rattled loose by the vibration of
the motor adjustment was easy

   all right i can fix this while she idles
he called and his nimble fingers set to work
with quick skill in a few moments he
muttered  thats all right i guess and
he climbed into the forward well it seemed
to him that perhaps the leader-hose might
be stretched a little too taut the pilot
tested out the new connection by gradually
opening out the throttle to its limit then
he choked down again and hung over the
edge of his seat

   seems all right now he shouted to the
field boss

   well give her a jump that individual
shouted back  youve got just about a
decent balance with that man forward

  selfridge doubled up in the well half
over and half under the grating with the
motor drumming in his ears heard nothin
of all this stevens opened up wide again
but selfridge was blissfully content sud-
denly stevens waved his hand the men
who leaned against the wings in front let
go and dived under the great machine
slowly gathered way and raced off across
the field

  it was then that selfridge knew in a
frenzy of terror he extricated himself from
his position and sprang to his feet-and
was instantly hurled against the rear of
the well by the blast that roared past him


the argosy

his cap disappeared from his head like
a conjuring trick and he gagged for breath
the machine was skimming the grass tops
now and must have been making about
sixty miles an hour in another moment
the pilot drew gently back on the control-
stick and climbed into the sky at a steep
angle

  sheer choking for breath forced selfridge
to duck his head under the well-coaming
and then the wilting of his knees let him
down in a huddled heap for several min-
utes he was too paralyzed to think

  blessed minutes of respite for when his
reasoning faculties returned to him he was
beset with the most hideous picture dis-
play of his life each separate one of his
previously imagined accidents flashed be-
fore him in vivid detail and with the climax
of each his breath ceased and his heart rose
to his choking throat with the immediate
expectancy of feeling the machine suddenly
lurch and wabble and then-his heart
ceased-plunged to the long shrieking dive

  but no lurch came yet no sickening
plunge his long reel of preimagined pic-
tures came to an end at last and his par-
alyzed mind was quite incapable of making
up any new ones in the ensuing blankness
he found himself vaguely conscious of all
the conglomerate voices of his engine there
was-a despairing sort of pride in the-droning
hum which the trained ear picks up asan
-undertone below the pervading racket al-
mosua sense of security in the strong steady
rear of the exhaust

  the motor was running beautifully and
on the grounclselfridge would have thrilled
to its music but here he cowered and
clutched with despairing strength at the
grating as though to hold the machine off
from thes expected crash by the sheer pull
of his arms

  there is a definite limit to every human
emotion having arrived at the extremity
of terror the mental reflexes presently tire
and are unable to hold their high pitch
they subside with slow palpitations and
leave a dull numbness behind through
which other emotions am able to register
again selfridge began to be aware of
another such emotion it was a queer ting-
ling of the nerves a racing shouting circu-

lation of the blood it was the exhilaration
of extreme speed he found for himself
what this unusual sensation might be-and
then the dive came

  the machine nosed over selfridge
gasped and clutched at the rear rods of the
grille over it went till it was almost per-
pendicular and then with engine going full
blast it roared down to earth selfridge
shrieked shut his eyes and choked on his
pent-up breath every nerve jringed be-
fore the expectant crash then suddenly
the engine stopped dead and a few mo-
ments later the landing-gear bumped gent-
ly another few seconds and it came to a
stop within a few feet of its take-off

   good landing boy  a voice congratu-
lated

   yep shes a bird responded stevens
easily pushing his goggles from his face

  selfridge climbed down from the forward
well and vomited his soul out before the
group somebody supported him with an
arm around his shoulders somebody else
patted his back the voice came again
with matter-of-fact confidence

  ive seen them that way before the
firsttime hell be all right in a minute

iii

  of course he was all right but it was
many minutes before- he could control the
trembling of his limbs it was anger at the
rough chaffing of the others that gave him
the impetus to climb up to the engine and
fumble among its cylinders as though feel-
ing for possible overheating the action
called for all the will power he had it
surprised him as a matter of fact that he
was able to do it at all for he had con-
ceived an almost physical fear of the brute
machine as though it might suddenly turn
andsnap at him

  during the rest of that week selfridge
was undergoing a peculiar sort of transition
machines of course were tested every day
and as field expert his was the responsibility
for the condition of the engine it was with
an almost ludicrous alacrity that he stepped
clear of every possible entanglement before
he gave the word announcing his  k
then he would stand and watch the power h
ful mechanisms scud away and roar up into
the high flier



the air with a strange feeling of mingled
nausea and interest

  they seemed amazingly steady up there
they dipped and turned with such perfect
grace that they carried an impression of
being calmly sure  of themselves as he
watched he imagined himself seated again
behind a humming engine whose giant
power he knew to the last revolution and
his imagination played tricks with him it
projected pictures of himself sitting calmly
confident toying with gas and ignition lev-
ers-he always contended that stevens was
too rough with those little polished knobs
which needed a delicate touch-and he felt
a faint echo of that tingling and racing of
the blood then when stevens would nose
the machine down for its long dive to earth
he would feel the same old sinking in the
stomach and would clutch spasmodically at
whatever tools he happened to have in his
hand and yet it never looked anything
like the fearsome fall he had experienced

  he felt impelled to talk about the planes
and their habits to stevens and since his
was the last word on the engines on which
stevens had to rely the superman would
unbend a little of his aloofness selfridge
was amazed to find that he couldnt tell
him much the boy had a certain tech-
nical jargon of pancakes and whip-stalls
and flip-flops and wing slips but as for
explaining just what stress was set up by
a pancake and where why he was scarcely
able to decide

  he tried to bluff through on his flying
patter but selfridge as a wire man and a
rigger knew much more than he did about
engines stevens was discreetly silent till
one afternoon in a burst of ingenuous
frankness cornered by the insatiable ques-
tions of selfridge he quoted the jealous
taunt of the ground force

   any fool can be a flier

  selfridge had been supplementing his
questions with a little private exploration
in a book entitled  theory of flight and
aerodynamics he grinned understand-
ingly at stevens then he made an extraor-
dinary statement

   id like to go up again-only im
scared

  stevens laughed like a delighted school-

boy he had found the one touch of na-
ture

   so was i he admitted cheerfully
 scared green but i just had to some-
thing -he shifted his gaze diffidently-
 something called me

   yes said selfridge  i know some-
thing up there

  and right on the heels of his tremulous
decision the fruit of his previous efforts be-
came apparent he was promoted to motor
tester immediately he saw a splendid pa-
geant of the bright lights of his own broad-
way stretching before him for a motor
tester is a man who makes money he is
a man who must know all the idiosyncracies
and moods of an airplane motor which is
the most temperamental piece of mechan-
ism in the world a cloudy day crabs
its disposition as surely as a sunny day
brightens it a few thousand feet of alti-
tude above what it likes gives it a cough
a humid day in summer will as likely as
not cause it to sulk and refuse to work

  a motor tester then is a man who is
worthy of the money he makes and he
makes quite enough to take a whirl now and
then among the bright lights

  selfridge patted himself and smiled wide-
ly the flesh-pots of egypt which had been
his goal were at last at hand yet he re-
fused the offer of promotion and said that
he preferred to remain chief field mechani-
cian for a while yet he explained it to
himself

   i guess i can hang that up for a little
while ive waited so long a little longer
wont hurt ill get this flying thing
through first and then-oh boy

  yet in making that decision selfridge
though he did not know it was admitting
that something had come into his life which
was more important than the flesh-pots
nor did he know that his method of ex-
pressing his decision was decidedly different
to what it would have been some months
ago yet less did he know that his own
broadway would have looked at him with
a hazy sort of recollection as though trying
to recall a vaguely familiar face

  for the face was a healthy brown-with
a smear of grease across one cheek just now
-and the lines that seamed it were lines of


the argosy

thought and of worried guessing at the next
mood of an engine and wrinkles of long
staring at a circling dot against the sun
and the hands those white blue-veined
hands of old were brown paws criss-
crossed with small cuts and scars and
steady enough to time the tappet clearance
of a valve to the prescribed decimal  of
an inch

  so selfridge remained on the field force
and stevens took him joy-riding it was a
fearful sort of joy at first yet in spite of
his tremors and the leaping of his bowels
into his throat with each dip of the ma-
chine the novice experienced  again that
racing of the blood which caused him to
whoop aloud as they swung round in a
spiral on a bank which brought selfridge
looking in astonishment over his shoulder
at the ground beneath

  sitting strapped into a regular seat
crouched behind the cellulojd wind-shield
and feeling the air whizzing in solid par-
ticles past ones ear was a very different
sensation from being banged about on the
bottom of an aluminum mail grille

  stevens was merciful he brought the
machine down to earth again on a long
easy glide selfridge was spared the sink-
ing sensation of a steep dive

   well how come grinned stevens as
he pushed home the gas control and cut off
the spark and the engine came to an abrupt
stop with a queer blip blip

  selfridge was removing his helmet he
was breathing hard he didnt know just
how to reply then he said irrelevantly

   how high were we

   oh about three thousand feet said
stevens

  selfridge was suddenly disappointed

   was that all gosh i thought we were
miles up then grinning  we didnt
reach it its still up there way up

  stevens looked at him quizzically for a
moment then he understood and grinned
too  oh the thing that calls yes ive
never reached it either i used to feel that
way too suddenly an idea struck him
 say he exclaimed  if it getg you that
way maybe-well you hold the stick next
time in your front seat and see how it
feels

  stevenss inspiration was correct in six
months selfridge was for the second time
in his life something which he would never
have believed-a flier and what was more
knowing how to nurse his engine as he did
he was a good flier extraordinary devel-
opment for selfridge of the gay boulevard

  the company made him a flight tester
and gave him more money even than a mo-
tor tester enough to make quite frequent
whirls through the region of the bright
lights selfridge determined to make his
long postponed debut-some time the
thought gave him keen satisfaction yet he
said to himself that there was just some-
thing else which he wanted to attain to first
he didnt know exactly what but he was
not satisfied that urge to go up and up
was not stilled as it had been in the case of
stevens selfridges ambition always had
been to be a high flier as in the old days
so now it seemed to be his sole ambition

  his imagination was working overtime j
these days fed by the need of analyzing
the tantrums of motors nurtured by his
vivid emotions in learning the mastery of
the air it spread its wings and soared it
reeled long rosy pictures-they were all
prisma process now-of himself circling i
high above fleecy clouds in an ultramarine
sky and chasing eagles it showed him
leaving the eagles behind and swinging up
to a limitless blue it dressed upon old
memories of fairy tales and thrilled him
with-well he could shut his eyes and be
almost sure that he saw the pearly gates
and on one especially inspired occasion-
that was after he had attended a banquet
in honor of certain foreign aviators and had
worn evening dress-he flew right through
them and was lost in billowing waves of
aurora colors

  fie felt that he must go up and see for
himself that something up there impelled
him irresistibly he adjusted an engine for
altitude and went there were no eagles
but he soared through the stillnesses of
upper space drunk with the exhilaration of
height and speed only when his gasoline
gage showed a scant inch in the tank did
he shut down on his engine and swing down
in long spirals

  he stepped out of the machine in silence
the high flier



he was exalted thrilled vague theoriz-
ings about human souls and sublime heights
flitted through his mind then as the ex-
hilaration wore off he slowly woke up he
shook himself angrily and muttered some-
thing about copy-book platitudes

  but there remained a disappointment
the something that called was still there
he felt that if only he might rise high
enough he might attain it and be satisfied
he found himself wishing that grace might
be conveniently getatable she was always
so ready to understand and explain things
which he did not understand flowever
grace was-wherever she was selfridge
analyzed his emotions for himself in an in-
expert manner and decided that the urge
was ambition calling him to make a record
whatever it was it was quite necessary to
go and find out

  selfridge sought out mitchell and sound-
ed him about the possibility of getting the
company to develop an altitude engine
mitchell smiled shrewdly through half-
closed eyes he was thinking of the wreck
of a year ago

   we-ell he said judicially  a record
is always top hole advertising if you think
you can do the stunt-and i wouldnt be
surprised if your trick with engines wouldnt
make it-why hop to it but youve got to
go some to beat thirty-two thousand feet

   i know admitted selfridge  but
give me the right engine and ill make it
or bust

   hm-mm said mitchell dryly  ma-
chines cost around the ten thousand mark
aviators cost-seventy-five a week but
ill tell you what well do with you go
up and show us that youve got the stuff
and well build you a special machine and
if you make hirty-five the advertising is
ours and you can keep the ten thousand
dollar prize

  selfridge spent a month studying the
effect of altitude on gas engines and experi-
menting with oxygen supply systems then
he chose a favorable day and went out to
show the company that he had the makings
of an altitude champion that was easy
the company put the promised special ma-
chine in hand but selfridge insisted that
success would lie in the engine

    	argosy

  he- was not satisfied with any of the
oxygen supply systems for that matter
he was not satisfied with anything these
days he was obsessed with a vague un
rest he wanted something but he didnt
know what it was he wanted he felt that
the call to climb to the greater heights was
the basis of his unrest and then the
thought of heights set him angrily to think-
ing what sort of a craziness this was that
overtook him at high altitudes his re-
searches into the reactions of gas engines
had not included anything about the psy-
chological reactions of extreme exhilaration
or about the purely pathological reactions
on some temperaments of oxygen from a
breather mask

  so he fretted and worried and felt the
longing for whatever it was that haunted
him and in the interim he developed an
idea of his own for supplying the necessary
oxygen for normal ignition at high altitudes
by a pressure pump if it worked it would
involve a patent and comparative affluence
and affluence meant lights laughter life

  but selfridge had almost decided by this
time that he was not nearly so anxious for
life as he used to think he was there was
that something else

  meanwhile the new machine was nearly
completed a masterpiece of clever desrgrt
and perfect material the designer told
him that the- company relied on his skill
and that he had therefore cut down the
factor of safety from the standard five to
three sacrificing the rest to lightness sel-
fridge didnt worry all he wanted was to
make the big climb

  at last the day of the great attempt
arrived weather conditions were perfect
but selfridge climbed into his seat without
much enthusiasm he felt an intuition of
disappointment however he showed a
cheerful face as he circled once over the
heads of the group on the field and waved
his arm at them then he set his controls
and roared away on a steady climb

  up he soared and up the engine-
tuned up with his own- hand-hummed in
perfect rhythm and the beautiful machine
leaped to every turn of the control surfaces

  ten thousand feet everything ran with
the smoothness of a jeweled watch twenty


the argosy

thousand selfridge knew that far below
in another world tiny specks were straining
their eyes to follow him with telescopes
his old sense of exhilaration began to come
over him his imagination took possession
again and projected rosy pictures of success
another five thousand

  selfridge sat with tense muscles his face
thrust forward a beatific smile on his open
lips beneath the hideous oxygen mask he
was wrapped in wool and leather swathed
to a shapeless bulk yet he felt as free and
unhampered as the thin air that hurtled
past him he was drunk with the exhilara-
tion of it as surely intoxicated so far as
his control over his reasoning faculties went
as he had ever been with sparkling cham-
pagne

  his eyes ceased to watch his instruments
and gazed wide open into blue space he
flew by feel alone with the unconscious
effort of the born bird-man he forgot
that he ever had a recording barograph
he knew only subconsciously that his con-
trols were set to climb at a certain angle
and he sat tense in just that position

  yet another five thousand feet but
selfridge did not know it engine and at-
mospheric condition and machine coordin-
ated perfectly there was no need of con-
scious effort selfridge was permeated with
a supreme confidence a pure emotion which
exalted him out of himself he knew that
was all he never questioned he just
knew that he wrould find the elusive some-
thing which his soul hungered for

  and then quite naturally and beautiss
fully he did he saw it floating diaphan-
ously before him a face

  first the eyes were apparent fine eyes
wide-set under level brows with a wistful
yearning in them then the lips curved
and tremulous and the firm rounded chin
and lastly the haira halo of russet brown

  selfridge started into sudden conscious-
ness his eyes stared behind his goggles
he leaned forward with an eager exclama-
tion the movement depressed his eleva-
tor control the machine dipped down-
wards and the vision was gone

  self ridge drew a sharp hissing breath
he was trembling he tried to think but
he found thought impossible he was too

unnerved to continue his flight he let the
machine hold its downward slant while he
pinched himself to ascertain whether he was
awake

  fifteen minutes later he landed almost as
lightly as a feather on his own field im-
mediately an excited group rushed to the
machine selfridge sat motionless in his
seat looking straight in front of him
mechanicians and managers almost fought
with one another to get a look at the re-
cording barograph sealed over the dial with
the official seal of the representatives of the
aero club

  whe-ee yelled a voice that cracked
in its excitement  thirty-four thousand
and some whai-ee-ee our man the
highest flier on earth 

  enthusiastic hands dragged selfridge
from his seat and hoisted him shoulder
high but his face remained set and grave
he knew now of course he had seen the
thing that called the thing that he wanted
his record meant nothing to him he
knew now that it was never the record that
had lured him there was no room for
mistake about his unrest of the last few
months he knew definitely what his souls
desire was

  and he began to understand in a vague
sort of way that it had been necessary for
him to rise to a plane far above where he
used to be before he could appreciate what
his desire really was he begged to be let
down  im dead tired fellers he said
id be obliged if youd let me go home and
celebrate without me

  he was tired too the strain of his emo-
tions had worn him out but not too tired
to sit down and write a letter a long-prom-
ised letter that ought to have been written
more than a year ago he mailed it at
once and then he went home and sat and
wondered whether he had seen what he
had seen

  he had plenty of time for speculation
days came and went and brought no reply
to the letter selfridge waited in gnawing
suspense he tried to reconstruct the scene
of his vision but his imagination raced
away into the wildest suppositions every
time he tried to think-and that was all
the time-the most grotesque explanations
the high flier



visualized themselves in vivid series sel-
fridge was forced to realize that he had
been in no condition under the spell of his
exhilaration up there to be sure of anything
or to remember anything

  it was a nerve-racking period for him
as the days went on and no reply came
the grotesque pictures took on a suggestion
of morbid gruesomeness selfridge began
to wonder cold fear in his heart whether
his realization had not come too late
whether the girl-the only possible girl
ever he knew now-was perhaps-he dared
not think it-perhaps beyond call and
whether he might possibly have seen a
spirit

  he had heard of such things many
scientific men were now beginning to be-
lieve tiiat certain people when in a con-
dition of a peculiar exhilaration which they
called trance were able to see or at least
had obtained vivid and recognizable impres-
sions of loved ones who had passed over

  the thing obsessed him it was abso-
lutely necessary of course for him to know
he speculated gloomily then whether if
he could reproduce the same condition of
exhilaration in the same circumstances he
might be able once more to see-what he
thought he had seen

  speculation did not hold him for long
certainty was what he needed he stalked
to the hangars and ordered out the ma-
chine

  there was no eager little crowd this time
no cheery wave of farewell and good luck
selfridge sat in his seat with a fixed expres-
sion and with a fixed purpose he took off
with as little delay as possible and climbed
as steeply as he dared he wanted to get
there and find out as quickly as possible

  once again he reached the thirty thous-
sand level without any difficulty thanks to
his patent and he cruised the attenuated
blueness with a set determination to find
out whether these thin chilly levels were
the abode of some unusual kind of spirit
and whether the urge that had drawn him
was still there

  his face set more bitterly than ever as he
pushed the control lever from him care-
less of the reduced factor ef safety-sacri-

ficed to lightness-he swooped down at an
angle which caused strangly ominous strains
and creaks to mingle with the shriek of the
wind rushing through the wires

  only the grace of providence and the
best material in the world averted a trag-
edy as he landed selfridge felt that his
leaden heart alone would be sufficient to
wreck the machine it was a bad landing
it would have been bad even for a beginner
it was bumpy and it was far from his usual
precision which brought the machine right
up to the hangar doors

  he sat in dull misery for a while and
then he climbed wearily out and removed
his mask to call to the figure which darted
out of the hangar and came running across
the field to him he felt dully annoyed
why did not the other mechanicians hurry
up to take the machine over star fiiers
were not people who should be kept wait-
ing he pushed his staring goggles up to
his forehead and pressed his fingers to his
tired eyes and blinked to readjust them to
normal vision

  then he started suddenly and trembled
as he had done when he had seen the face
up above was he seeing it again the
figure that ran across the field so eagerly
was it a deft handed mechanician or was
it just one of the fool girls who so ineffec-
tually washed off the machines after flight
and if so why in thunder wasnt his regu-
lar crew coming out

  it was a girl an ardent impatient girl
strong and graceful with wistful wet eyes

  she threw herself against the wool and
leather monstrosity of a man with an in-
articulate little squeal of anxious content-
ment and pressed close

   i-i just got your letter she sobbed
for no reason whatever  ive been away
and-and ive been looking for you for so
long howard

   ive just been looking for you too
gracie girl-up there and i guess ive
been looking for a long time before that
too only i didnt know what i was looking
for why didnt you tell me

  the girl lifted a shy wet face 

   i was going to said the girl simply
but you ran away

the girl stood quiet in the cabin door-
way looking out at the brilliant
frosty night over sugar loaf the
cold glittering moon shone full the big fir
on its summit stood stark and black against
the vivid blue of the star-studded sky be-
hind like a giant sentinel watching over the
silent valley

  below her at the bottom of the little pass
the winding trail with its single strand of
telephone wire beside it showed plainly in
the moonlight up the mountain a wolf be-
gan howling the girl turned back into the
cabin abruptly and closed the door behind
her

  the supper she had been preparing was
almost ready the little board table near
the fireplace was set for one over in a cor-
ner from a large wood-burning stove came
the odor of steaming coffee

  the girl put a lighted kerosene lamp upon
the table and served herself with a single
plateful of food from the frying-pan once
she stood still listening but only the muf-
fled noise of the brook and the lone wolf
baying broke the silence for a brief in-
stant her glance rested on the telephone
instrument fastened to the wall beside the
fireplace then as though reassured she sat
down and began her solitary meal

  a knock upon the door made her leap to
her feet and stand for an instant trembling
she put her hand into the pocket of her
gingham apron her fingers gripping a little
revolver that lay there the knock was re-
peated the girl withdrew her hand-

empty-and with a trembling smile that
seemed to belittle her fear she crossed the
room swiftly and flung open the door

  a man stood on the threshold-a slim
young man in a short heavy coat blue flan-
nel shirt corduroy trousers and neat in-
congruous leather puttees he was bare-
headed he stood wavering with a hand
against the doorway to steady himself all
his weight on one foot and the toe of the
other just touching the ground

  you cried the girl her tone held
amazement but it was tender too with
love then as she saw the pallor of his
face in the lamplight and his lips pressed
together in a thin straight line of pain she
cried again

  tom youre hurt

  her arms went around him and leaning
heavily on her he hobbled across the room
the pain made him moan and he sank back
in the chair and closed his eyes the girl
knelt on the floor beside him and began
gently to unstrap one of his puttees after
a moment he seemed to recover a little he
sat up and wiped the sweat of weakness
from his forehead with his coat slfeeve

   i know i shouldnt have stopped beth
but i-i knew you were alone to-night
for an instant the drawn lines of pain left
his face his eyes looked into the girls
tenderly

  beth looked up into his face brushing
back a wisp of hair that had fallen for-
ward over her eyes that he had come here
frightened her but she was glad that

 
the right thing



he had come and the sight of his pale face
with the look of pain on it made her eyes
fill with tears of love and sympathy

   what happened tom she asked

  the boy shook himself together  i
wouldnt have stopped honest beth-only
my horse threw me-a mile back toward
rocky gulch he winced as the girl
withdrew the puttee and began unlacing his
shoe

   only sprained i guess he added
 but it hurts like the devil-and im
bruised all over from the fall he laughed
ajittie in boyish apology for showing his
pain to a girl

   it was about an hour ago i wasnt
going to stop-i wanted to get to vailstown
to-night the horse shied at something and
bolted and left me lying there i dont
know-i guess im a rotten rider he
grinned sheepishly

  he had come to her of course it was
all he could do then without a horse and
with a sprained ankle at night on the vails-
town road at the thought of having him
here with her when he was hurt and needed
her help the girls heart grew very loving
and tender	

   ive been an hour coming he went on
quietly-he brushed her hair lightly with
his fingers and smiled- and now im here
beth im-im sort of glad the accident
happened

  she made no answer but went on taking
off his shoe and the heavy woolen sock
his ankle was red and swollen she raised
his foot to a low wooden bench and he
watched her silently while she filled a pail
with hot water then he noticed the food
on the table

   finish eating beth he said  this
can wait-it doesnt hurt much when i hold
it still

  again she did not reply but held his
foot and ankle in the water a moment and
then wrapping it in an improvised bandage
replaced the sock she was very tencfer and
gentle once the boy made as if to kiss her
but she pulled away effectually but with-
out resentment wonderment was in his
eyes as he followed her swift deft move-
ments

   why dont you say something beth

he asked after a moment  whats the
matter with you

    now you can eat with me she said
she had made him as comfortable as pos-
sible and returned to the stove

   he took the plate of food she handed
him  i know i shouldnt have stopped
beth-but i couldnt do anything else
could i

   how did you know i was alone she
knew what he was going to answer and it
frightened her

    i saw your stepfather in rocky gulch
this afternoon-no wait listen beth-id
tell you wouldnt i if anything had hap-
pened

   he went on impetuously as though to
dispel her rising fear

    he was drunk beth and hes too old a
man look at that-he clenched his fist
and the muscles of his bared forearm rose
up in knots- i could have twisted his
neck with that for what he said about me
and you but i promised i wouldnt lift a
hand to him and i didnt no matter what
he said i didnt mean to meet him-and
then-when he said what he did i--well
i just listened and beat it thats all

   the boy shoved his food away from him
untouched and looked across the table to
meet beths frightened eyes

    dont you worry kid he added re-
assuringly  i wont hurt him and he cant
hurt me-except with his gun the girl
shuddered and he hastened to add

    he wouldnt do that beth dont you
think it for a minute even when hes drunk
he wouldnt do that-hes too much of a
coward-he knows hed swing for it

    he said he would tom

   he said he would if i come up here
again i didnt come did i

   it was a month now since her stepfather
in drunken rage had ordered tom from the
house and threatened to shoot him if he
ever came there again but after all he had
to come to-night as things happened and
her stepfather was away-the first time he
had been away in months-and he need
never know that tom had been here

   he wont be back until to-morrow-
youll be gone then said beth voicing her
thoughts


the argosy

  her words seemed to rouse the boy to
sudden anger  why should he forbid my
seeing you anyway he went on resent-
fully  i love you beth and you love
me and i want to marry you  his tone
changed abruptly  you do love me
beth

  he held out his arms appealingly and in
answer the girl rose silently and kissed him
 you know that tom she said simply

   then why do i have to sneak away like
a thief jusf because we love each other
whats that hes got against me

  you know why he said it was tom
she crossed the room again to attend to
the stove

   because i havent got any money i
know-thats what he said but ive got
enough to keep you as well as he does-
and better he glanced around the cabin
contemptuously  you know that isnt the
reason itd be the same anyway-unless
maybe i had a fortune and would give
him some of it

  beth winced it hurt somehow to have
him say things like that but she knew it
was true and she knew too just how he
felt-how he resented the way he had been
treated

   besides why shouldnt i marry you
the boy went on  im from the east
same as you ive been to college-my
familys as good as yours-for all his
drunken talk-better than his if you ask
me what he wants is to get you a rich
husband back east if he cant stake a big-
paying claim out here and i dont fit into
that scheme thats whats the matter and
you know it

  beth laid the coffee cups on the table
and sat down again facing him

   you mustnt talk that way tom she
remonstrated  you just mustnt i wont
listen ive told you that before i cant
listen to such things why were you going
to vailstown to-night

  he ignored her question  well im
right and you know it i love you and
id make you happy hes the only thing
in the way so far as your happiness is
concerned hed be better off dead and i
wish he was oh i know its a rotten thing
to say but i do look at that

  he leaned forward suddenly and gripped
her by the shoulder pulling her toward him
 your necks bruised black and blue you
think i dont notice things like that dont
you i know how he treats you when hes
crazy drunk-and im the only one who
does and i cant do anything about it be-
cause you wont let me

  tom-i-

   and -because hes your stepfather you
wont let anybody say a word against him
but you know hes no good to himself or
anybody else hed be better off dead and
you know it somebodyll get him one
of these days too-the way he acts down
there at the gulch when hes drunk-you
wait and see some day theyll find him
lying in a gully or something where some-
bodys pushed him he hasnt got a decent
friend in the world-only the bums are good
enough for him and that damn one-eyed
charlie he pals around with

  beth sighed hopelessly

   some day theyll find him dead down
there the boy went on charlie 
do it maybe-hes a rattlesnake anyway
and when he talks to me like he did to-
day and i see your neck horribly bruised
the way it is now i feel as if i could do it
myself sometimes-if i had a good
chance

  his words shocked her perhaps even
more because some little whispering devil in-
side said it would be better that way-
better for all three of them she rose
abruptly and bending down put her hands
on the boys shoulders looking him square-
ly in the face

   tom you didnt mean that she said
evenly

  his eyes shifted and avoided her own
and she felt her heart leap with sudden
fear

   well i feel as if i could anyway he
answered sullenly  and you wouldnt be
sorry-deep down in your heart

   tom you cant talk this way i wont
listen dont you understand-i wont
listen

  she pulled her chair close beside him he
put his arm about her shoulders and drew
her to him hungrily

   tom why were you going to vailstown
the right thing



to-night she asked again when he had
released her

   i-i- he seemed to make a sudden
decision  i wasnt going to tell you beth
till i was sure he met her searching
gaze squarely  i think ive struck it beth
-over there on cedar creek it looks
good-pans richer than anything around the
gulch i wanted to get it recorded in vails-
town to-night then if everything was all
right i was going to phone you

  his face was flushed and eager now and
very boyish she leaned forward and
kissed him

   im so glad tom at last-you de-
serve it youve worked hard

   i think ive got it beth-got it for
you just like i said i would

  beth rose and went to the window  its
clouding over she said  well have snow
by morning

  she came back to the fireside and glanc-
ing at his bandaged ankle smiled  youll
have to stay here to-night in the morning
ill walk over to simpsons-its only three
miles back around sugar loaf-and get you
a horse you can make it to vailstown
then

  a faint distant sound outside made them
look at each other in sudden alarm they
listened it grew louder-a horse coming
along the trail from rocky gulch at a gal-
lop beth thought of her step-father per-
haps returning unexpectedly-to find tom
here with her in the silenc she could hear
again the lonely howl of the wolf on sugar
loaf-a sound immeasurably mournful
very much like the desolate silent moun-
tains themselves

  she rose to her feet trembling the
sound of the horseman approaching grew
steadily louder then her glance fell upon
the little tin clock over the fireplace she
smiled with the relief of sudden compre-
hension

   nine oclock tom id forgotten its
only the mail rider for-vailestown

  she went to the window  its snowing
tom she added

  tom was sitting up in his chair tense
she wondered vaguely why he did not seem
relieved at her words

   it is the mail she cried after a mo-

ment she opened the door a little and
stood looking out

  the boy started from his chair standing
upon his injured ankle without thought of
it  he may stop beth he mustnt see
me here it wouldnt look right dont you
see-it-

  she wheeled on him sharply  he isnt
going to stop she said then she flung
the door wide open and stepping outside
waved her hand to the passing rider on the
trail below

   sit down tom she came back into
the room and closed the door  you
mustnt stand on that ankle

  he sank back into the chair his face
white  god he exclaimed  i shouldnt
be up here with you alone to-night after-
after what-

  beth sat down again beside him the
thoughts that came to her mind frightened
her she tried to dispel them but couldnt
she put her hand upon his arm

   im glad youve struck it tom she
said  i knew you would and some
time-

   im going to have you for my wife
he finished and take you back east
maybe where you belong

  suddenly he flung his arms about her
again and kissed her upon the lips roughly
its the right thing-the right thing
beth he repeated the words a little bit-
terly

   she disengaged herself gently

  you say  the right thing tom she
returned quietly and you mean to be
cynical because ive said that to you
sometimes-and-you never quite under-
stood did you

   but why shouldnt you marry me if we
love each other he protested again

  he had never understood of course and
hadnt he the right to understand

   ill tell you what i meant tom-what
you have never understood-never real-
ized her face was very earnest very
serious you say my step-father is-is
no good well youre right he is no good
as the world judges those things-and may-
be as god judges them too but hes the
man my mother loved-theres no getting
away from that tom-she loved him and


the argosy

she died loving him and with the whisper
on her lips telling me to help him and care
for him as long as he lived she laughed
-a curious little laugh that seemed to catch
in her throat

   i never told you that did i tom i
was only fourteen then-but that day talk-
ing there with mother i thought out my
creed-my religion to do the right thing
always tom-thats it-thats all there is
to it not the thing that may look best for
me at the time or even right for me-but
the just thing-the right thing in the eyes
of god

   her delicate little face grew wistful with
the memories the words evoked she had
never spoken to tom-or to any one-like
this before she had hardly realized until
now as she put it into words how much
this simple creed of hers had come to mean
to her-how unconsciously she had used it
as her guiding star through all these
dreary mournful years that followed her
mothers death

  she had been unhappy she knew and
yet not unhappy either since happiness
came with the knowledge that she was do-
ing the right thing

  and then tom had come-tom with his
love that had awakened hers with the
promised fulfilment of all her girlish
dreams it was hard for tom-hard for
her too when now the right thing made
them deny love but still she had gone
on trusting-hoping blindly hoping-just
waiting for god to work it out in his own
way-the way that would be right for them
all and she was sorry now-and a little
frightened-that she had never let tom
understand

  her eyes were dim and soft with tender-
ness as she leaned forward toward him

  that you can understand tom its
very simple isnt it and dont you see
thats just what father never has done it
has always been the right thing as he saw
it yes-but the right thing for himself-ah
ways the right thing for himself

   and somehow tom it doesnt seem to
work out when you only figure the right
thing for yourself i dont just mean that
it hurts or sacrifices others-but somehow
some way it dont work out for you-your-

self it looks all right-you cant see why
it isnt all right but theres something
working against it-some law of nature-
or god maybe-or something-and it just
dont work out i believe that tom-i
believe it absolutely-and-and no matter
how hard it is im trying to live up to it
i promised mother that

  tom moistened his dry lips  then so
long as he lives you-you-

   she put her hand over his moutr

    dont tom dont it isnt only that
way-its in everything the right thing
always-even if it looks wrong and bad
for me and i believe in the end it will
work out best-something we dont under-
stand will make it work out

  suddenly she slipped from her chair
onto his lap with her arms about him her
head on his shoulder

    but i do love you tom so very very
much all the yearning tenderness of- love
was in her voice  i do want to be your
wife-some day-when its the right thing
to do

   the telephone bell rang startlingly loud
in the silence of the little cabin beth
pulled away from the boy and rose to her
feet that nameless apprehension-the
vague presentiment she had felt before-
came back to her now as she stood looking
at the instrument hesitating the ring was
repeated-a slightly different call this time
abruptly stilled

   what is it beth is it for us the
telephone was silent now

   she lifted the receiver a voice in con-
versation sounded in her ear instinctively
she did not speak but listened with an
eager attention

   dead said the voice  lying there
dead with marks on his throat-murder all
right

   the little cabin room went suddenly black
for beth the noise of the brook down by
the trail seemed roaring in her ears out be-
yond she heard the wolf still howling she
knew she must not faint-whispered it
bravely despairingly to herself

   beth beth what is it the boy had
started to his feet

   at the sound of his voice her head sud-
denly cleared she let go of the telephone
the right thing



box she had clutched for support and raised
her hand in warning for silence the voice
in her ear was still sounding she recog-
nized the voice now-the sheriff of rocky
gulch

  -hell of a scrap this afternoon the
voice was saying  its him all right-only
circumstantial evidence but damn strong
and hes gone-you know him-tom haw-
ley-that slim young feller from the east
over at ransomes

  the man in vailstown made some an-
swer

  you send some men down the trail
the sheriff went on   he might come
along any time probably wont and
phone centerville-or whatever else you
think best youll hear from me later-
morning probably i gotta ride way over
now and tell his daughter-i dassent phone
her with her all alone out there hell of
a job too then in the morning well get
busy right

  again the man in vailstown spoke-
some question this time about one-eyed
charlie - and the conversation then con-
tinued

  but beth heard no more the shock of
this abrupt news of her step-fathers death
and then the suggestion of murder-murder
done by tom hawley the man she loved
--the man whose wife some day she wanted
to be-all whirled through her confused
brain

  tom hawley standing there now by the
fireplace watching her wonderingly-tom
hawley was a murderer

  the shock of it caused a sudden revul-
sion in the girls heart her fingers gripped
the little revolver that lay in her apron
pocket the sheriffs voice was still sound-
ing in her ear her lips were at the mouth-
piece-she had only to speak to give tom
up-a murderer whom the law demanded

  and then something within her-some
tiny voice of nature-whispered to the girl
that she loved tom hawley and that he
had thought it was the right thing to do-
only because he loved her-because he
wanted her for his wife-wanted to make
her happy if she gave him up he might
be sentenced and hung the man she loved
to be killed by the law

  the right thing the words of her creed
came back to her which was the right
thing now her tired brain groped at the
question wearily the right thing the
words she had said to tom flashed through
her mind not the thing that may look
best for me but the right thing in the eyes
of god and something-some lawt we
dont understand-will make it work out
all right

  beth dropped the telephone receiver to
the end of its dangling cord and put her
hand over the mouthpiece then she
whirled to face the boy who still stood
watching her expectantly

   theyve found it out tom her voice
came low but vibrant and tense in the
hand she held outstretched a bit of polished
steel glistened in the lamplight  they
know its you

  at sight of the revolver she pointed at
him the boy started forward amazement
incredulity were on his face

  beth why beth what-

   were going to do the right thing tom
-the right thing in the eyes of god

  he was hobbling forward and her voice
rose suddenly

   tom--tom hawley dont you hear
me dont you understand she waved
the revolver toward the wall nearer the
telephone  stand over there-over there
against the wall no i mean it-as he
continued coming forward  not a word
now tom or ill shoot dont you under-
stand cant you see i mean it she end-
ed almost with a sob

  the boy hesitated stared into her gleam-
ing eyes an instant and then drew himself
up against the wall silent holding the re-
volver leveled beth took her hand from
the mouthpiece and lifted the receiver again
to her ear the sheriff was still speaking
in the phone

   this is beth-beth rollins she in-
terrupted her voice sounded almost cas-
ual she heard the sheriffs gasp of aston-
ishment his profane exclamation and went
on evenly

    ive been listening sheriff williams i
-youre looking for tom hawley-well
hes here-here with me now hes-hes
going to stay here until you come she


the argosy

waited through an instant of silence and
then the sheriffs voice said with seeming
contrition

   im mighty sorry miss beth i was
coming over to see you to-night-i clean
forgot you were on this line in the excite-
ment your step-father-he-

  she interrupted his awkward embar-
rassed explanation her brain was whirl-
ing the room was dim to her sight with
only the boys white face and his question-
ing eyes watching her standing out clear
and sharp

   tom hawleys here with me she
heard her own voice repeating  he-hell
wait for you here

  and then thesheriffs voice said

   hell mam your step-father-it didnt
happen only a few minutes ago if tom
hawleys there with you now thats all
the alibi i want-its a cinch he wasnt here
im mighty glad you happened to tell me to-
night miss beth or it would of gone hard
for him you let me speak witr him mam
if hes there-it must have been one-eyed

chapter xix

a fair enigma

 jiss bingham you will step inside
i y i the house ill talk with you later
cates hastily commanded

  am i under arrest

 he hesitated

  if you are arresting me warden cates
 you must tell me why she insisted

  i have been told that somebody leaped
 off that wall

  somebody did she admitted

  do you know who it was

 i could not see the persons face

  what were you doing-but ill talk
 with you later miss bingham step in-
 side

 she stiffened herself and stood in her
 tracks  am i arrested sir

 it was plain to warden cates that this
 was not a matter to be handled rudely or in
 the hearing of hisassistants his wife had
 come to the door anxiously seeking more
 information

  anna here is miss bingham - you
 know-the friend of-of squire nile ex-
 plained the warden covering the thing as
 best he was able at such short notice  she
 will step inside with you

  as a prisoner demanded nina in-
 sistent on thfe point

  no promised cates desperately  as
 a guest as a guest of mrs cates and
 myself theres trouble outside here
 its no place and no time of night for a
 young lady to be strolling about alone

  while he was speaking he urged her to
his wife by a firm grip on the girls arm
nina entered the house

  when warden cates was finally back in
bed after the intermission in his nights rest
his puzzle was ready for him and no
almanac-twister had ever set him such a
stunt what had this girl been up to

  there had been a knotted rope dangling
down from one wall of the prison an up-
ended plank marked some sort of illicit ac-
tivity on another wall but in the prison
there was neither a convict less nor a con-
vict more than there had been when the
count was made the afternoon before

  why was the girl there

  she most assuredly knew that barron
douglass was not in the prison the news-
papers had been explicit on that point and
had even reported him as being here there
and yonder in most emphatic fashion

  in fact after the excitement of the night
had calmed down the warden had solemnly
assured his  guest  that douglass was still
at large and then cates was sorry because
he had promulgated that information with
so much positiveness the girl displayed the
only satisfaction that she had shown in the
one-sided interview

   but now that i have been honest with
you miss bingham you must be equally
honest with me

  miss bingham before that interview
began had recovered her breath and a great
deal of her poise and she kept both because
she did no talking and would not allow her-
self to be jumped by arguments or threats

this story began in the argosy for february 




the argosy

  the warden attempted a bit of clumsy
craft after he had enlisted his wife as his
aid he assured the girl that she ought to
telephone to her anxious friends whoever
they might be and he invited her to step
into the private sitting-room and call up
anybody with whom she might care to talk

  miss bingham was duly grateful for the
kindness blandly affecting not to notice
that there was an extension instrument in
the library where they were seated but
she would not think of disturbing friends at
that time of night

   if youre afraid youll disturb any one
by going home at this late hour mrs cates
and i will be delighted to have you remain
as our guest and i suppose you live at
some distance from here prodded the in-
quisitor

  the girl made no reply she said nothing
when he inquired where she was employed
in the city she did not display any emo-
tion of any sort in her silence neither re-
sentment nor anxiety warden cates re-
turning her serene gaze was conscious that
it was the same sort of a disconcerting stare
that one finds in the steady regard of an
unresponsive kitten

  therefore realizing the uncertainties in
the pursuit of a cab should he allow the
girl to leave that night he told mrs cates
to install their guest in the best spare-room

  and the next day he instructed mrs-
cates to use every feminine art in pumping
the young lady

  the sum total of that pumping was so
mrs cates reported an expression of miss
binghams opinion on the fine weather as
the windows of the spare-room permitted
her to see it and some chatty compliments
on mrs catess taste in the furnishings of
the guest-room the hostess also reported
with some astonishment that the young lady
seemed to be perfectly contented to remain
just where she was

  the warden keeping his own counsel in
the matter of ninas continued presence in
his house had been cogitating upon possible
results to be obtained by setting her loose
and detailing a man to shadow her he
entertained no great hopes to be sure con-
sidering how the young woman was keeping
a tight rein on herself in all other ways but

it was the only recourse that occurred to his
official mentality

  however when she seemed satisfied to
remain as his guest his mentality was at-
tacked from another angle she had become
more of a puzzle than ever and mr cates
was a hound in the matter of puzzles

   the only sensible thing is to keep her
here a little longer ill get a line on her
yet he told his wife

  before he resumed his personal attack on
the problem in petticoats he allowed the
chaplain to have a try approaching the
maiden from the angle of friendly relations
and anxiety for the safety of a misguided
young man then the warden employed the
brusk aid of the prison physician who had
a way of his own in getting at mental reser-
vations

  both of them failed

the chaplain deplored her obstinacy
the doctor called it  spunk and con-
fided to warden cates a hearty admiration
of a girl who- could play the game through
as this girl was- doing il

   i was obliged to -couifine my study of
her to her eyes affirmed the doctor  i
can usually make a patient show the tongue
-but that young lady never allowed me to
see even the tip end of hers when it came
to opening her mouth to talk not one
word from her

   but its plain enough that she came
back here with the young fellow to put
something over in the way of helping a
friend to escape i dwelt on the matter
with her and her eyes hinted that i was
near the truth but i wasnt aware that
douglass made any especial chums here in
prison

   he made two very hot and hearty ene-
mies-and thats about as far as he got in
the way of social intercourse retorted the
warden  perhaps he was trying to help
somebody to escape he may come back
and try it again but there are two men
whom we wont have to watch-and they
are fogg and foster

  and that was the evening of the night on
which those two exceptions from douglasss
friendly interest sawed their way out with
tools that had been secured somehow-
somewhere
the big boss in bronze



  warden cates had plenty to occupy his
mind after that to the exclusion of almanac
puzzles and the enigma presented by a reti-
cent girl

  he knew only one man who had a fair
claim to the confidence of miss nina bing-
ham of canton

  the telegram that the warden rushed off
to squire cassius nile was filled with urgent
appeal the squire reported in person as
soon as a train could bring him

  he listened attentively to warden catess
exposition of a struggle with a puzzle
result to date no solution  and i have
never had any occasion to do much wor-
rying over women before in my life con-
fessed the fat warden with a wheezy sigh
 i give it up and youre in a position to
handle it

  squire nile did not jump at the oppor-
tunity that was offered

  on the contrary he pursed his lips and
tapped his finger-tips together and dis-
played an irritating amount of legal re-
serve

   youve simply got to do it insisted the
warden

   eh what say-what say

   young douglass is trying to get in
touch with her were laying for him its
for his own good too to come back here

   do you expect my client to walk in
here because youre holding the girl here as
a bait

   your client scoffed warden cates

   exactly considering what your atti-
tude was on a certain occasion when i asked
for a private talk with my client it occurs
to me that i can get along better with my
client while hes out of prison

   you knowr more about the inside of this
than youre telling me complained cates

   perhaps

   i dont like the attitude you are taking
nile

   i can afford to take a very superior at-
titude right now purred the old lawyer
 i am not begging favors

   i thought i could deal with you on the
basis of our old friendship thats why i
have sent for you im in trouble

   cates now youre talking real sense
you can deal with me on that basis

   but you-

   hold on i do know more about this
thing than i have any mind to tell right
now that boy is innocent hes trying
to prove his innocence i havent been
doing half what i have wanted to do to help
him but by gad cates im not going to
hurt him-when its only a matter of keep-
ing my mouth closed i tell you you can
deal with me on the basis of friendship the
moment you come down off that official
mule youre mounted on you have located
her boarding-house-her place of employ-
ment you tell me and youre keeping watch
and have promised rewards-oh thats only
old stuff do you want me to help you as
a friend

  i do

   then ill take that poor girl right back
to canton with me-her own home town-
where she belongs

   by thunder youre right thats
where hell come out of the bush if he
shows up anywhere 

  the squire gave the prison official a
malevolent look  you dont think im
rigging a derrick along with you to betray
the boy do you

   no but-

   but when i can send you the news that
will make you and the rest of the one-ideaed
blunderheads who have been gunning this
case good and ashamed of yourselves ill
report-and ill expect you to grab in then
and help just as twice as hard as youve
tried to hurt

   i have nothing against douglass per-
sonally pleaded cates

   why should you snapped back squire
nile  hes innocent he rose  now
bring nina to me she is going home poor
girl

       chapter xx

the beacon of tingley hill

cergeant barron douglass
came back to his home town of canton
a skulking fugitive

  he was slinking far from the highway
along the beech ridges waiting for the twi-
light to deepen into night he welcomed


the argosy

the darkness he knew his way about in
those woods and along those shadowed lanes
where as a boy he had hunted partridges
when he could escape for a few hours from
the tyranny of farmer blaisdell

  douglass had only half-formed plans for
he was obliged to depend on circumstances
as he might find them his future was as
dark as the gloom of the night-his hopes as
few as the stars that he could see through
the cloud-rifts

  to get to cassius nile with his story and
his troubles-he was making that his first
sole aim

  one of the beech ridges led a tongue of
woods well down to the village and he kept
on till he could see the lights in the stores
and houses

  he mounted a boulder sat on it and
waited for the lights to wink out

  the old squire had his bachelors room
at the village tavern that made it impossi-
ble to confer with him that night

  but douglass had provided himself with
pencil and paper before the twilight had
faded he had written a bit of a note which
he intended to slip under the squires door
that night he asked the lawyer to remain in
his office late the next evening promising
to come as soon as main street was de-
serted that would be soon after ten the
young man knew the stores were closed
at nine oclock and the folks of canton were
usually early to bed then a more desper-
ate determination began to urge him

  he understood the habits of his towns-
people so well that he resolved to be ven-
turesome to wait twenty-four hours after
leaving the note was a hard trial of pa-
tience the squire often went back to his
office after supper douglass knew there
was a chance of catching him there if a
sortie was made early enough this evening

  before half past nine flanking the block
by means of an alley he managed to slip
into the corridor and mount to the floor
where the lawyers office was located 

  a card was hung on the squires door and
the single light in the corridor shone on it

out of town

  the poor fellow clutched his empty hands
till the nails stung the flesh

  not a door in his home town open to
him even the dogs would bark him out of
woodsheds and barns disguised though he
was by dirt and dishevelment he could not
afford to have an eye in all canton rest on
him in this locality he was not dealing
with careless throngs and indifferent police-
men and there was no  governors
grave resort of a complacent clan with
the motto  mind your own business

  what was the lonesomest plce in cari-
ton

  douglass a native did not need to debate
that matter with himself

  it was the tingley mansion on the hill
even during the old misers lifetime

  now untenanted abandoned by the heir-
ess it must be more utterly lonesome than
ever-branded and shunned no doubt be-
cause of the new horror that attached to it

  dire necessity forced him to seek some
shelter hateful as the old house was he
must have the sort of protection that it
would give him

  another thought mellowed the protest his
natural feelings were making the house be-
longed to nina by going there though
she could know nothing of his tenancy he
was accepting the hospitality of the dearest
champion he possessed he would dwell un-
der the roof he could feel the comfort of
knowing that she had been there

  he made stealthy exit from the village
and mounted the long hill

  the winds had risen aftermath of the
protracted rains and the norway pines
murmured disconsolately when he stood
under them and made survey of the house
the clouds had been swept from the sky
and the stars lighted the hilltop

  the windows of the lower story had been
boarded up and this sealing of the place
against humankind added to the desolate
melancholy of the mansions aspect he
walked around the house in order to ascer-
tain whether any unbarred window would
afford him an entrance he deciphered
markings roughly chalked on some of the
boardings one warned  gosts here
kepe away it was up-and-down juvenile
chirography in another place he found
 hornted house

  in a sagging building once used as a car-
the big boss in bronze



riage shelter-now open to the weather-he
lighted matches to aid his search and came
upon a rusty crowbar with this tool he
pried loose the bottoms of two boards of a
kitchen window broke the catch by an up-
ward blow entered and pulled the boards
into place behind him

  the barricaded windows permitted him
liberties with a light he found a lamp on
a shelf and felt easier when it shed its glow
upon the surroundings

  the furnishings of the house had not
been disturbed so he learned when he made
a tour of the lower part the hole in the
wainscoting of the dining-room had not
been closed the make-shift door hung
down giving uncanny suggestion of a dead
mans sagging jaw

  he did not venture to visit the upper
floor of the mansion with his light though
the grim thought occurred to him that he
thus might more effectually secure isolation
for himself by carrying out the chalked sug-
gestions playing ghost after the fashion of
the miser in  the chimes of normandy

  he was infinitely weary of body after his
miles of toiling along mud-smeared roads
and through the sodden forest there was no
more clarity in his thoughts when he tried
to figure on his future plans he puffed out
the light and stretched himself on the couch
where he had found nina lying unconscious
on the night of the tragedy

  but he dozed rather than slept the
wind made eery sounds outside and the old
house responded with cracklings and creak -
ings

  then at last he heard a sound that did
not partake of the supernatural a door was
slammed and locked with a vigor that sug-
gested human agency the doors were open
between dining-room sitting-room and
kitchen when douglass opened his eyes he
saw in the kitchen the sharp ray of a flash-
light

   where the blue blazes did you leave
that lamp demanded a gruff voice

   same place shelf

  douglass was not astonished recognizing
these voices on the contrary he felt a
queer sense of relief he was commending
his prescience in the matter of these rec-
reant rascals he had told himself that

they would go to canton here they were
hiding in the most natural covert that
query about the lamp showed that they
were not visiting the house for the first
time they were talking like regular tenants
and started out toward them in a most mat-
ter-of-fact way

   heres your lamp he called signalling
his approach as he turned the corner into
the dining-room

  he saw foster in thekitchen shift the
flashlight to his left hand and begin to claw
frenziedly with the right at his hip pocket

   you- dont need that revolver that i
stole for you said the young man coldly
contemptuous and in full command of his
nerves  you can see who i am

   well ill be-

   sure enough broke in fogg

  nobody spoke for some seconds

  then mr foster inured by his experi-
ences to tense situations showed that he
had calmness of his own  well so youve
got along thats good weve been ex-
pecting you

  douglass marched into the kitchen and
set the lamp on a table  ive been doing
a little expecting of my own-at a place
called  governors grave i reckon words
dont suit this case-id better take the two
of you by the necks and rap your lying
heads together

   licking us got you something once-
but it wont work that way a second time
bo said mr foster mustering a concilia-
tory grin when the grimed savage features
were thrust close to his face  we all three
decided on this place as second choice pro-
viding there was any choice

   you-re a liar

   i have been called that before-be-
cause ive been misunderstood if you
didnt understand what i said-

   you never said it

   i meant to say it then but you know
what a state prison is for carrying on con-
versations in youre broken in on so much
that you never get a chance to finish a sub-
ject but now that youre here-showing
that you -can do helpful thinking for your-
self-why make a friendly meeting un-
pleasant between gents who have so much
in common


the argosy

   what are you doing here

   tending to business

   straight dope supplemented fogg
eagerly trying to assist in placating

   the business you promised me to at-
tend to was clearing from me the charge of
murder

   sure thing but we had to hurry up
here to look after a little business of our
own

   leaving me hiding and dodging and
worrying my heart out the two of you
are-

   now lets not go into a lot of details
about why we slipped up on that meeting
pleaded foster  were here now right
according to  the arrangement that you
forgot

  he did not quail under the infuriated vic-
tims stare of disbelief and profane words

   say if you stub your toe on a brick in
the sidewalk whats the good of going back
to stub it again lets go on all friendly
and helpful d-n the newspapers they
reported us as being loose there wasnt
time to waste in getting up here that was
our business and its linked up with yours

  i dont know what youre driving at
foster

   doesnt it strike you as kind of impor-
tant where old tingleys money has gone

   i dont give a continental damn about
the money  i want you to expose the man
who murdered swinton tingley in his
passion douglass beat his fist on his breast
 im the one to be considered ahead of that
dirty money

   it may be more or less soiled-we
havent had a peek at it yet returned
foster dolefully  but we propose to
he twisted his features in an ugly grimace
and growled mr fogg drove an admoni-
tory elbow against his associate

   i mean to say that i aint as much in-
terested for myself-seeing that the money
doesnt belong to me-as i am for that nice
young lady who used to give us a pleasant
smile every time we passed the library win-
dow in our days of trial and tribulation
foster hastened to add in way of qualifica-
tion  and seeing what you must be to
her it seems to me that youd be thinking
about what belongs to her

   look here ill stand no more bull of
that sort- foster all you are thinking
about is grabbing that money-wherever it
is whoever has it youd cheerfully walk
over me to get at that money but ive
kept my word with you and fogg i risked
my safety and my life i have lost some-
thing thats too sacred to be mentioned in
the hearing of you pigs ive done my
part man-fashion now you forget money
and do your part for me or by god eternal
youll find out that a man who has shot
huns can do a good job at it on this side of
the water

  his harsh voice rang through the house
he clacked his fists under the mans nose
the three were silent after he had finished

  foster seemed to find the young mans
gaze troublesome and walked up and down
the kitchen playing thoughtfully with the
skeleton key that he had plucked from the
ell door  i guess youd do it he ad-
mitted at last  a lot of these fellows who
have come back from there have got all
kinds of grit they didnt have when they
went over

   i guess well have to bunch hits so as
to let all three of us run the bases at the
same time we hurried up here douglass
to get in a whack of our own before setting
off the big blow-up we have been hiding in
this house ill be honest with you and
admit that we havent been able to do any-
thing sensible with our own affair up to
date and thats because the newspapers
tipped off the condemned-i mean to say
the news got out that we had got out 

  the smug way in which the fellow still
insisted on putting some vague concerns of
his own ahead of an innocent mans agony
of soul drove douglass out of all bounds of
self-control  you demanded a price
you sold me something i have bought it
now pay 

   but by going off half cocked-

   pay douglass was snapping the fin-
gers of both hands in front of fosters face

   thats a nice way to treat pals-think-
ing of nobody else but yourself 

  that was blowing the victims wrath with 
a bellows in sooth

   i helped you to get out of state prison

i can put you back there ill go outside
the big boss in bronze



and yell my head off calling the neighbors
and the constables ill hang to your wheel
and turn you over to the law foster
youve got to give me action now do
you hear now no not another yip of
your lying tongue now i say -

  condemn your pelt shouted foster
 if thats all the sense youve got in hand-
ling a delicate matter and helping friends
have it your own way he turned on
fogg  you know what we have planned
for a final splurge 

    s-s-s-s-sure 

 well its got to be sprung now or hell
have the jaspers jumping us get busy
it was plain that foster was commander-
in-chief of that regiment of two mr fogg
started for the door

   no you dont i propose to keep my
eye on the both of you  but while doug-
lass was in the midst of his protest foster
leaped back to a tactical distance and
pulled his gun

  yes he does bo you dont seem to
be fooling with me just now by gad im
not fooling with you either if you try to
trig im going to shoot

  it was a desperate rascals cold-blooded
threat and fosters even tones carried con-
viction

  this is no job on you stated the
stick-up gentleman when fogg had rushed
out  its on another critter and we hope
its going to be for mutual benefit even if
we do pull it off on short notice youll
kindly stand right in your tracks

  fogg had left the ell door open

  in a few moments a dull glare lighted
the night outside

   nothing like having all arrangements
made ahead said foster  we didnt
expect youd be in so much of a hurry-
but seeing that you are were glad we
were all ready to accommodate all the
kerosene on the premises and plenty of dry
kindling 

   what does this mean gasped the
young man at bay

   it means that the old barn has been
torched up son and its really a good
night for the job because the roof of this
house is wetnd -he backed to the door
-- yes and the wind is strong tother way

     	argosy

id hate to be a party to hurting your
girls house even if you do insist on quick
action

  fogg came running in  s-s-shes off ifi
great shape he reported

   then off it is for all three of us
douglass you have said that you propose
to hang to our wheels youd better
come onhe shoved the revolver back
into his pocket  forget jhe gun-play bo
there wont be any more of it if youre sen-
sible from now on its mutual-and we
hope its going to be self-acting

  there was nothing else for douglass
except pursuit of them they ran and he
followed

  the old barn some rods away from the
mansion was now a torch heaving great
clouts of flame above the hilltop it was
a fiery signal that would bring the towns-
folk of canton flocking there and the
locality was no longer a refuge for an es-
caped prison convict

  foster had locked the ell door with the
skeleton key and the old house gave no
sign that it had been recently tenanted

  the precipitate torching up of the old
barn had sufficiently astonished douglass
but when he went chasing after the two
conspirators the course they took added
to his amazement he had expected that
they would make for the woods across the
fields escaping from the highvay along
which the volunteer fire-fighters would
come streaming already shouts of men
were borne on the night wind from the
village and a bell had begun to clang

  foster cut across in front of the house
under the norway pines and went directly
to the highway then he ran down the
road the other two at his heels douglass
panting tried to put questions but neither
man replied

  a quarter of a mile down the hill in
the direction of the village the leader of
the expedition hopped over a stone wall
and crouched down and his companions
joined him

   the thing thats under yotir vest-have
it ready tudge commanded foster
breathing heavily between the words the
big stones of the wall were chinked with
small ones foster pulled out several little


the argosy

stones and made an aperture through which
he could peer and observe passers the
highway was fairly well lighted by the glare
of the leaping flames on the hilltop  save
your questions and get your breath and
keep your head down he grunted in reply
to douglass

  men singly and in groups according to
their ability to make speed were passing
they were confused by the conflagration
which smeared the night skies and their
excited comments revealed that they were
not sure which one of the stand of tingley
buildings was on fire

   thats good growled foster  there
will be another critter doing a whole lot of
guessing

   sure and if our guess is right hell
be coming to tend to a matter of business
thats as much ours as his

  the young man was obliged to keep on
guessing for himself foster threatened to
bang him on the head with a stone if he
didnt keep his mouth shut and when
he tried to peep through the crevice in the
wall where foster was lurking the boss of
the party rudely pushed him aside

  he knew by the sounds in the highway
that the principal rush of fire-fighters was
past once in a while somebody went
puffing along suddenly foster yanked
something away from fogg and leaped over
the wall a moment or so later he was
back tussling with a man over whose head
and body a sack had been drawn  take
his feet tudge ive got a good grip on
his gullet come along

  douglass marveling followed behind
into the woods

  in a deep coppice the bearers dropped
their burden and foster stifled the moans
of the unknown with gripping hand

   no talking no whispering said the
boss  theres no telling how much
snooping theyll do

  by this time there was no longer any
glare on the sky the bam had been mere-
ly a wooden shell and that shell had been
quickly consumed

  they who waited in the coppice heard
the shouts of those who were returning
from the fire they were coming away it
seemed with much celerity in the night

their words carried far and men frankly
stated that they did not hanker to hang
around the tingley house in the night
after the crowd had left

  when the silence encouraged foster he
picked up the head and shoulders of the
man in the sack and again fogg lifted the
other end of the burden foster had been
enjoining silence on the captive by occa-
sionally administering slaps or thumps

  the little procession made its way
through the woods and around to the rear
of the tingley domain every once in a
while foster stopped and listened as-
sured he went on

  dull-red coals marked where the barn
had stood no human forms were silhouet-
ted against the bedded fire there were no
sounds from the direction of the mansion

   they didnt lose any time in getting
away afraid of ghosts probably com-
mented mr foster  well in about five
minutes theres going to be somebody in
that house wholl be damnation afraid of
something that aint ghosts lug him
along tudge

  he stood the sacked captive beside the
ell door and used the skeleton key he
dragged him in produced his flash-light
and yanked off the sack

  in the circle of the electric dazzle was
revealed the convulsed countenance of dr
abner sawtell it was no longer cherubic
it was ridged with hideous fear the sack
had tousled the white hair and spires of
it stood like exclamation-points of terror

   welcome to our city-i greet you in
behalf of the visiting firemen was mr
fosters grim greeting

chapter xxl

treasure unlocked

t ets see you mentioned something
about action didnt you drawled
foster turning to douglass  well how
about this

  the young man was too astounded to
make any sane rejoinder

  dr sawtell had not spoken he stood
there with mouth agape tottering in an
effort to stand erect
the big boss in bronze



  were much obliged to you for hurry-
ing us up like you did pursued foster
 we were sort of ducking the proposition
it was ticklish to tackle but it has
worked

   i cant see anything in this except a
devilish outrage declared the young man

   barron i am in dreadful danger my
boy protect me quavered the doctor

  the poignant memoryof dr sawtells
attitude on the witness-stand was still keen
in douglass and there were squire niles
hints the old lawyer was not a man who
babbled idly

   i call on you as a friend in my need
insisted the captive

   god help a man when you call him a
friend and ask him to help you rasped
foster  you- he dealt in furious
oaths  look at me and fogg when you
say that

  dr sawtell stumbled to a chair and sat
down in it

   youre talking to a pal of ours-not
to a friend of yours put in fogg

   hold on im able to speak for my-
self in this thing stated douglass  and
im going to be almighty open when you
were on the witness-stand you didnt do
me one good turn dr sawtell

  i had to tell the truth

   i know a little something about law
sir you did volunteer certain facts but
the manner in which you gave them made
them the most damnable kind of false cir-
cumstantial evidenee-and you must have
known that you were putting the wrong
construction on innocence i say you did
know it 

   hand it to him-he deserves it ad-
vised foster

  im nottaking your side against this
man cried douglass hotly

   you ought to you asked for action
here it is

   ill have no more of your balderdash
you have promised to tell me wlio killed
swinton tingley you dont dare to in-
timate that dr sawtell had anything to do
with it

  oh he didnt do it certainly not

   i have done nothing bleated the doc-
tor

   thats right to a certain extent you
old hellion but youre going to do some-
thing almighty soon declared mr foster

   theyre wicked men and you must
save me barron

   you can depend on me to see that
you get fair play dr sawtell-whatever
this is all about

  fair play repeated foster twisting
the words with nasty sarcasm  see here
douglass he went on savagely  its
about time for you to wake up and lay off
this story-book hero stuff youre trying to
pull

  im trying to be decent and if that
kind of stuff belongs in a story so much
the better for the story retorted the
stickler

  ive read about em like you are but
ive never bumped into one before now
shut up for a minute this is no sunday-
school session theres no time for sermons
or long stories he turned on the doctor
who was attempting to plead with doug-
lass  the shut-up orders go for you too
theres going to be a showdown

   do your showing then snapped
douglass

  you know that a job was put up on you
before you went away to war-that is to
say unless your high and mighty ideas have
argued you back into believing that all men
are angels do you need any more showing
about that job

   not much

   believe none of his lies barron in-
sisted dr sawtell

   the big burg has shaped up some able
crooks averred the sarcastic mr foster
 but believe me they cant shade these
up-state hesekiahs whose minds are not
taken off their night-time thinking by any
roof-garden show douglass i can tell
the truth when i have to and when its for
my own good im handing you stuff thats
on the dead level

   this grand old doc came down to the
big town and got a line on fogg and my-
self as handy tongs for a job he had doped
no matter about how he met us-this story
is going to be short for theres business
ahead  so as to make us feel confidence
in him he wised us about himself do you


the argosy

see the plot thicken son making himself
a bird of a feather and all sociable

  the knave menaced the sputtering doc-
tor with his fist and went on

   told us about one douglass and how
he had put that poor guy out of the run-
ning in a certain matter where a girl and
a lot of money were concerned at the same
time getting in a grab at some coin for
himself does the old doc love money
oh boy

   go on sergeant douglass standing
very straightkept emotion out of his tones

   docs son was going to get the girl
agreeing with one tingley to be very nice
about asking foolish questions on money
matters girl couldnt see docs son so
doc having felt his own pulse and realiz-
ing that the case would prove fatal if he
didnt get his whack at the cush proposed
to go at it another way

   thats where fogg and i fitted in in
the mean time the proposition had jibed
around so that the aforesaid other way
was almighty handy estate all in cash
in a hole in the wall ding ding go
ahead nothing to it for men like us
said he was doctoring the old skinks prom-
ised to poke him dope good and proper so
that the job would be an easy one agreed
to wait down the road near by with his
horse and wagon so that he could flick
the stuff away and hide us till we could
make the divvy and duck

   and we gets the swag-though there
were extra trimmings to the job like you
know-and we runs and slings it into his
wagon-the narrators voice was steadily
rising until foster was squalling with ugly
rage- and then he larrups his horse and
beats it away and leaves us in the road

   you didnt throw it into my wagon
youre crazy it was somebody elses
wagon

   youre a liar douglass im giving it
to you straight he double-crossed us
then we cracked that store safe hoping
to grab off money enough to stay by till
we could get him right when the papers
printed it about us getting out of state
prison he got his tip and has stayed in
his house till to-night playing sick with a
couple of strong-armers he called nurses

   fogg and i have done a lot of discuss-
ing together you bet your life and we
says to each other that he would hide that
swag in the place where thered be the
least hunting for it weve got brains for
such plays fogg and i

   s-s-s-sure have 

   right here on the same premises where
it was taken from-thats the place why
did we come here to hide-why did you

come here douglass its the last place
where anybody would expect to find you
or us

   and is it here how about that fire
to tole him it was a play we had planned
i tell you the swag is here and he came
hustling to see about it condemn you you
old hyena it is here 

  he doubled his fists and advanced on the
cowering doctor  you acted like a hick
slapping his hand on his wallet when he
hears somebody holler  pickpocket  its
the old game we tried it it worked
now uncover or down comes your mansard
front

  dr sawtell struggled to his feet his
fears had produced a reaction of desperate
determination  all lies all lies my
good name protects me

  not here-not now stated foster
with vicious emphasis  i reckon you
havent dared to spend much of that money
-probably you aint any readier in letting
go of it than tingley was where is it
 i have none of the money-i dont
know where it is

   then youre due for a little memory-
refreshing if you can forget that it was
dumped into your wagon you can find it
easy to forget where it is fogg accord-
ing to plans-get busy

  in spite of his suspicions of the past
the brutal revelation had so shocked doug-
lass that speech failed him and his wits
were clearing but slowly

  he was assured of the selfishness of the
two convicts they were bringing out all
this stuff for their ends who had killed

s	win ton tingley they were not hurry-
ing to give him the information that he
was seeking with an eagerness that made
the affair of the money of small account
in his mind again he demanded
the big boss in bronze



    if you expect me to believe that youre
a friend of mine foster tell me who those
men in the house-

   all in good time bo im running
this

   im going to have a hand in it too
insisted douglass what their spirit of re-
venge had planned in the case of dr saw-
tell might jeopardize the young mans in-
terests he could not afford to be wholly
dependent on such natures as fosters and
foggs when he looked into the beseech-
ing countenance of the doctor he restrained
his own spirit of vengeance in order to
employ tactics more shrewd than threats

    i tell you im going to see fair play
here dr sawtell it doesnt seem possi-
ble-it cant be true what they say tell
me the whole truth and ill stand by
you

  the captive grasped at the opportunity
to gain a protector  ill expose them i
must save myself breck blaisdell and his
brother robbed tingley and killed him
those two men standing there know it
barron and they told me so on that same
dreadful night go to breck blaisdell and
his brother for that money let me out of
here-i had nothing to do with the thing

   in that frantic clutching for help-in his
despairing attempt to escape from the
menace that threatened at that moment
dr sawtell had allowed his tongue too
much liberty in admitting his knowledge of
the perpetrators identity

   douglass in the riot of his emotions did
not bother with what the doctors guilt in
the actual robbery might be you say you
know that about the blaisdells-you were
told that-and you went onto the witness-
stand and said what you did about me
you didnt start an investigation of the
blaisdells

    i had to be careful-they were not ac-
cused was dr sawtells amazing reply

  douglasss breath was knocked out of
him for a moment

    this seems to be a night for springing
things ahead of scheduled time observed
mr foster urbanely  what he has just
handed over to you was the prize package
we were saving up to pay you with doug-
lass after the little business of our own had

been attended to well seeing that it has
slipped out we may as well inform you that
the good old doc here isnt a liar on all
points fogg and i found that we were
running against opposition on this project
we bumped against other parties one night
took a good look after we had yanked off
their masks and found some local talent on
the job and they were sure persistent
cusses in spite of the scare they got they
were the guys in the houss when the fire-
works were touched off they were the
ones who handed over to us the  tag-
youre-it  hair trunk that fogg and i later
tossed into the old docs wagon a waiting
in the lane

   but this is simply wasting time on
minor matters that have nothing to do with
the money he went on callously he
rolled up his lip and showed his teeth
 doc you have had the keeping of a nice
little pet now trot it out and let your
friends pat it

   barron i have been honest with you
i have told you pleaded the man who
was threatened  i have tried to use
you-

   like youd use any floating thing you
could get hold of if you were drowning
damn you dr sawtell he shouted  i
would have died in state prison for all the
help you were to me

  here are your real friends purred
foster patting his breast

  friends raved the victim you
renegades simply trod me under to be able
to reach what you are after if i hadnt
followed you here to this house would i
have stood any show i have had to
fight this thing through for myself-under-
stand there are five men going into the
hands of the law-and the law will know
what to do

   dont need any more help hey in-
quired foster

   not your kind-judging from the sam-
ple ive had of it

   let me get you right going to throw
the gaff into us

   im going to have a square deal even
if i have to lug you crooks into a court-
room by the scruff of the neck

   say bo arent you making pretty big


the argosy

talk for a narrow place there was threat
in the query

  but the scapegoat of that infernal
affair was not in a mood to temporize he
was not dealing in mere bravado big as his
talk sounded his troubles had kindled a
hot fire under his determination to be
sure but his natural contempt for the men
whom he had beaten up was his better
reason for taking that attitude under other
circumstances it might have seemed rash

 its talk i can back up 

   foster pulled his gun and patted it

 heres a little guy that you havent
counted into the odds

    im getting well acquainted with that
joker and im not afraid of it said doug-
lass scornfully however he kept steady
gaze on foster he was planning a quick
leap feeling that if he could secure the
weapon he would have control of the situa-
tion his close concentration of all his
faculties on foster was his undoing

   he did manage to whirl on his heel when
a squawk of warning from the doctor en-
lightened him regarding danger in the rear
but he was not able to dodge the kitchen
chair that fogg had raised douglass saw
it coming-that was all

   he was in stifling darkness when his
senses returned in a moment he realized
that the handy sack had been pulled over
his head and that ropes bound his arms

   he heard something which distracted his
thoughts from his own sorry plight-a
bodeful harrowing sound it was the hid-
eous squealing of a human being in torture

   whatever was going on was not near at
hand in spite of the muffling sack he
realized that much the dreadful clamor
was under him-in the cellar of the old
house he decided he kicked out his feet
and moved a chair and figured that he was
still in the kitchen where he had been
felled

   then the bloodcurdling shrieks in the
inquisition chamber below died into gasp-
ing moans

   later he heard feet come trampling up-
stairs and there was a mumbled conference
between men he could not distinguish the
words

in a few moments he was lifted and

pushed upon a chair and the sack was
pulled off

   the lighted lamp without its chimney
flared on the table and he saw the hair
trunk close by it opened and revealing the
tingley treasure foster and fogg were
in the room

   the former was standing by the table
propped on his outspread palms  the
memory-refresher worked he reported
malice in his grin  the old-fashioned way
-its always best to stick to the old meth-
ods-saves brain-wear

   he pointed to the lamp flame  hard
on the soles of the feet-but saves brain-
wear then he patted the hair trunk

 so you see bo we had the good old doc
doped right he was obliging before he
passed away he told us which foundation
stone to move in the cellar

    has another man been killed on ac-
count of that cursed money choked
douglass

   certainly not we simply gave him
a little extra scorch and he fainted that
was kindness it saved him from the
wrench of seeing the money lugged off
same idea as when he gives ether to his
patients were naturally kind-hearted
when anybody gives us half a chance

   he came around the table and stood in
front of douglass  its on account of
our kind hearts that youre sitting up right
now with that sack off the question is
are you going ahead and give us half a
chance

   the captive made no reply

    of course after the way you put it
up to us a little while ago proceeded fos-
ter with victors equanimity  the perfect-
ly natural thing for fogg and me to do
would be to walk off and leave you in your
sack and the good old doc in his sog but
fogg and i have talked it over circum-
stances happened so that we couldnt de-
liver goods to you just the way we had
promised you have had a raw deal all
the way through no doubt about that
so in the interests of a fair play proposi-
tion-that same being a bug with you it
seems-what say to splitting this swag
three ways

  you whelp raged douglass this
the big boss- in bronze	m

 is just as much robfeery as the first job wasf
 are you asking me to join in that kind of a
 crime

  the thing has become complicated
declared foster preserving his calmness
 you really havent any business to- be
here complicating- things but seeing that
youre here and the circumstances being
what they are were offering you a third
why that doesnt make you a robber
youre- simply taking it as an agent to hand
it over to the girl we pity the girl-she
always- gave us a kind smfle you know
if you refuse to act for the girl in this
thing and grab off something for her you
ought to be ashamed of yourself take
your pickings then off we go and mind
our business-m

  in his extremity douglass forced him-
self to hold back what he realfy wanted- to
say yes off you go but where does
that leave me fin die eyes of the law
men

   oh you have the doc for a witness
and the tip- about the bmsdells they can
be stampeded law can do most anything
on a straight tip look what it has done to

you

   you renegades wouldnt be bothering
to offer to give me one dollar of that money
if you werent making it a play to keep- me
off your trail 

    well if we treat you square- its only
natural to expect that youll show some
man-feeling for two other poor critters
fogg and- i may as we fade out of this
case douglass whats evidence of state-
prison birds worth in court your tip is
enough-with the doc on exhibition

   this laymans crude idea of what consti-
tuted evidence offended the embryo law-
yers intelligence as acutely as the callous
selfishness provoked his choler

  but mr foster understood so he be-
lieved some of the hidden traits of human
nature even if he did not grasp the finer
points of law he caressed the paeket of
bills and began to pile them on the table

 theres nothing like money he crooned
with moist lips  money affi stacked up
like this it  do anything you ask it to
do baled fun with a wad of it in
your pocket you can walk anywhere and

they bow down and do what you ask give
you what you want when you want it
every time you wet your thumb and peel-
off a layer

   douglass you want to get over the
fool idea that fogg and i are afraid of
you you have been tied up long enough
to come to your senses and know that you
aint the boss of the outfit any longer
look at this sweet stuff 

  both he and fogg werebendihg over the
bills all pressed smooth with a misers
loving care their attention was wholly
absorbed

   i guess old doe didnt have the- heart
to spend it probably sneaked up here
where no one- would bother him- and had
a gay time counting it over its the hick
idea of how to use money look at it
douglass- doesnt it make your mouth
water

  but douglass was looking at something
which the intently occupied rogues did not
befiald- back in the dimness of the cellar-
way was a face-a contorted ferocious
visage it was visible just above the sill
of the door then a hand appeared in
it was a revolver and the hand took aim
but the weapon was jerked to and fro and
up- and down as crazily as though shaking
palsy were- disabling the hand

  douglass felt an itching of apprehension
along his spine he was in line almost
with the foes whom dr sawtell was threat-
ening therewas no telling where a bullet
would land when the trigger was pressed
by the finger of the victim whose nerves
had been so wickedly unstrung by terror
and torture

   we propose to show you douglass
that were not a bit afraid of you well
cut loose the ropes and you can come to
this table and sit down and help us count
this noble swag probably your fingers are
aching by this time on account of those
ropes too bad the touch of this money
will stop aches better than liniment

  the knave had his own sage opinions on
the placatory influence of money in the
fist

    fogg take- your knife and cut off those
ropes this is going to be friendly and
sociable from now on 


the argosy

  then repeating the words  friendly and
sociable mr foster reached for his hip
pocket he looked surprised and began
to pat himself with both hands in the re-
gion of his other pockets

   lay off on that rope cutting tudge
he called

  but on this occasion as on all others
mr fogg had obeyed with instant alacrity
the commands of his boss

  the ropes were off

  condemn it exploded foster un-
guardedly  i laid that gun down when
we were tying up old doc in the cellar

  he turned and faced the cellar door

  the doctor leaped to his feet from his
hands and knees and the exquisite agony
of his tortured soles when he stood on them
brought a yell of agony out of him then
he shouted barron and flung the re-
volver over the wildly clutching fosters
head the aim was not good but the
young man knocked fogg down and caught
the hurtling weapon by a side reach that
would have won applause for a baseball
player

  foster was after the gun with a rush
it was not a time for words and doug-
lass was no longer depending on fists he
leaped to one side when his attacker
lunged past unable to stop the sergeant
deliberately put a bullet into fosters leg

  by the time that fogg was on his feet
douglass was posted in a corner of the
kitchen where more flank attacks would
not endanger him

  foster fallen was staring wildly and
fogg stood in his tracks

   just a moment before this goes any
further warned the young man  i
dont want to kill off valuable witnesses at
this stage of the game

  he  broke down  the weapon and took
a quick glance and noted that one cartridge
of the six in the chamber had been ex-
ploded

   i am pretty handy with a gun men
i won a regimental prize in france for
instance

  he looked about the room  i dont
think the skeleton key will be needed here
any more

  he took aim and fired at the key in the

ell door the bit of metal was snapped
short off

   i merely want to show that i can plant
four more bullets into your systems where
they will do the most good in making you
behave

   im bleeding to death averred fos-
ter displaying a blood-spotted hand

   we have a good doctor right on the
premises i took that into account when
i plugged you dr sawtell attend to your
friend at once

  he had seen signs of rebellion on the
doctors face the physician was on his
knees groaning -with the pain in his feet
he did not venture to disobey sergeant
douglass with that gun in his grip was
plainly not a person to be provoked further
with safety

  dr sawtell crawled toward his patient

   fogg look in that bureau and see if
you can find cloths snapped the new boss
and do what you can to bandage that
wound

  there were towels when the makeshift
job had been finished the doctor and fogg
crouched down on the floor beside foster

  sergeant douglass sat astride a chair-
back the revolver dangling significantly
from his fingers  i reckon that no talk is
needed weve got to wait till daylight
this better be a session of-well silent
prayer he advised

  so far as keeping silent went they
obeyed his suggestion they found no
spirit of conciliation in the sergeants ex-
pression

  at last the crevices of the boarded win-
dows were revealed by streaks of light
dawn was without

  the spectacle of daylight-significant of
imminent exposure-stirred dr sawtell to
speak

   barron i have had plenty of time to
do thinking but im not going to argue
this thing i have a question to ask are
you determined to turn me over to the law
along with those two men

   i am absolutely determined dr saw-
tell your decision not to argue is a wise
one

  the silence was not broken for a long
time
the big boss in bronze



   you may remember that i had some-
thing to say once about the dangers of
temptation the doctor ventured  the
curse of money-getting money-keeping
money-the curse-it ruined me and
when money was in my hands i could not
spend it look on the table every cent
of swinton tingleys money is there
douglass was silent

   i have prostituted my profession for
money whimpered the doctor  cassius
niles knows he has been groping in my
affairs he has been hounding me

   you had better use a different word
than  hounding  when youre speaking of
an honest man and a square lawyer sir
 but he has been threatening me

   then he must have had good reason
 you know what his reason was cried
the doctor displaying sudden anger  you
are too close to him not to know dont
try to make a fool of me you know and
thats why you are stubborn now when i
have asked for mercy an old man ought
to find mercy- but i was obliged to fight
back when niles threatened me it was
all on your account that he threatened
but how was i to say anything about the
tingley case without them getting their law
clutch on me i had to protect myself
 yourself first thats always been
your play growled foster

   im sorry for you sir-i can say that
much put in douglass after all he was
finding it hard to steel himself in the case of
this old man herded thus with wretches
whose profession was crime

   if thats the way you feel- the old
man began to plead

   its no use sir youre only making
it worse for both of us matters must take
their course

   why dont you show a mans grit in
taking your medicine demanded foster

   im trying my best to put the personal
side of this thing out of my thoughts dr
sawtell stated douglass  im proving
it by keeping still now about what you did
to me but i believe that cassius nile is
right and that there are bigger matters
than my poor affair to be uncovered in this
town i propose to be able to tell cassius
nile that i did my duty j

   well do it and dont preach so much
about it rasped mr foster having cal-
lous notions regarding the pros and cons of
chivalrous intent

  sergeant douglass withheld retort

  dr sawtell held his peace also for some
time then that bitter spirit of semi-
hysteria that he had shown before flamed

   i dont know as it makes any difference
what you do young man in my case it
was coming in another way anyhow
through that devil of a cassius nile with
his poking and his prying into cumulative
poisons and cumulative evidence

   but ill never stand up in court and
have him wag his finger and bark at me
no no ive been ready for him im
ready for you young man a man must
go he babbled on  i have seen so many
of them go-and its nothing its only
this

  he had been fumbling in his waistcoat-
pocket he held up a small object he
popped it into his mouth and gulped it
down he pointed to his bare feet black-
ened swollen seared with the flames from
the lamp  i cant stand the pain any
longer i cant stand a lot of other
things 

  douglass jumped to his feet even
while horror-stricken he realized what the
old physicians recourse had been when fi-
nally brought to bay dr sawtell crum-
pled down rolled over and lay motion-
less

   well i must say hes a crack shot when
it comes to shooting the pill observed
foster

  his friend fogg exhibited no especial
discomposure he went even further in
callous indifference itwas evident that the
grudge still had its wire edge

   one little witness took a dose of goo

  made a flop and did his duck and then there
    were two

   if either one of you whelps lets out
another yip till i say the word ill plug
you with lead shouted douglass  lay
a towel over that face

  when fogg had obeyed the sergeant sat
down again on guard

  day was broadening in mellower tints
the argosy

outside there were- flickers of sunshine
through- the crevices of the boards at the
windows and dust metes danced in the
radiance of the shafts of light

  there would be daylight visitors to the
scene of the fire

  douglass- considering that one of his
prisoners was- wounded in the leg resolved
to wait

  between the guard and those he guard-
ed the heaped fortune of old swinton
tingley on the kitchen table provoked in-
vain the temptation to grab

chapter xxii

a daylight ghost

qfnce sergeant douglass had stood
guard over a party of captured huns
but they were hypocritically servile and
their meekness hid sour rebelliousness

  there was nothing of the sort in the
demeanor of messrs  foster and fogg
their imposed si-ienee was without sul-
lenness- though they were rogues they
were practising the philosophy they had
preached to- dr sawtell and were  taking
their medicine  heroically

  douglass knew better than to patronize
them as a victor or to condole with the
as- a sympathizer he became conscious
that he entertained no more resentment in
their case they were returning his gaze
with complacent resignation with backs
against the kitchen- wall they were waiting
without complaint or expostulation

  late in the morning the sergeant had
something- to- say to them

   i have tried to play this thing fair
men now im going to take into account
what you were up against after you es-
caped your grudge and that money made
you pretty careless about my business
im going to forget it

   considering that youve said that word
you- mentioned a while ago and that a yip
is- probably allowable ill yip  thanks
replied foster

   im going to turn everything over to
lawyer nile i cant compel you to post
him up on what you know

no compelling needed you win on

the showdown we shall shove all our
chips over to- you

 i shall tel the whole truth to the pris-
on officials undter the circumstances
theres no knowing what squire nile may
be able to do for you in your own affairs
 all small favors gratefully received 

   sure  affirmed mr fogg

   and now having done a little some-
thing with unfinished business id like to
make a remark for the good ofthe order
-wkkmt rising proffered foster mov-
ing his wounded leg with a grunt

  douglass nodded permission

   there are beef sandwiches in that cup-
board over your head

  the young man was weak wife hunger
he scaled a sandwich to each of ms pris-
oners and took one for himself while he
was munching he heard the voices jf chil-
dren outside he had anticipated thaf
children seizing on an opportunity before
school-time would make early visit to the
scene of the affair that had- interested their
elders so much the night before douglass
was in need of a messenger

  but when he had pushed aside the
boards that he had loosened in order to
force his entrance into- the mansion- the
children shrieked and fled from this day-
light ghost and his wild appeals only urged
them to more frenzied flight

  he was obliged to content himself with
the thought that the story they would
spread would bring grown-ups to the place
in hot haste

  so with the crowbar with which- he had
gained entrance he knocked all the boards
off the window stood in plain sight and
waited

  after a time a few of the nearer neigh-
bors appeared in the highway and prudent-
ly lingered there the group had become
-a considerable crowd when constable nute
came whipping his horse up the long hill
from the village

  after he had hitched- the animal in front
of the gate the constable was so exasper-
atingly slow in advancing that douglass
urged him t hurry repeatedly announcing
his identity

   you may be  bad douglass but by
swanny you dont look like mas declared
the big boss in bronze



mr nute skeptically  no wonder you
scared the little tykes

   im not trying to frame any beauty
tableau in this window nute i have two
prisoners to turn over to you-i shall turn
myself over too and dr sawtell has com-
mitted suicide here send for the medical
examiner for the love of the lord man
get a move on i ask only one favor
for myself i have an idea that squire nile
is at the county seat wire him to rush
here at once

  constable nutes slow mind had not be-
gun to digest the heavier chunks of the in-
formation that douglass had fed out but
the matter of squire nile was one that he
could handle easily

   no need of spending money for tele-
graphs when hes right here at home i
just left him in judge braggs office where
he is representing nina bingham in talking
over the insurance on the barn she is back
home here and-

   nina bingham douglass yelped the
words and leaned far out of the window

   squire nile brought her with him on
the late train last night and i dont see
anything to be excited about because shes
back here in her own home town and now
to get down to something thats really im-
portant and-

   nina bingham the sergeant banged
the butt of the revolver on the window-sill
like a crazy moderator calling for the main
question  how-how-how-

   well ask her how seeing that youre
bound and determined to fool away time
on things that dont amount to a hoot when
here lies doc sawtell and-

  he came closer to the window when
douglass continued to rail

   i tell you to ask her how whatever
your howlaferoopus is all about there
she comes with the squire and the judge-
to adjust her insurance probably

  to adjust insurance

  rather so the frenzied lover thought
to adjust the universe which had been so
infernally out of joint since she had
dropped from the state-prison wall

  with dim eyes he beheld her running to-
ward the old mansion as if his wild calling
of her name had summoned her behind

was squire nile and the trial justice fol-
lowed with dignitys slower pace

  she was showing none of constable
nutes doubts about the identity of the
haggard face in the window

  she ran toward douglass with arms-out-
stretched and he leaned low and clasped
her when she was in his reach

  under calmer circumstances when tu-
mult of soul was not sweeping all consid-
erations other than her own dear self out
of his mind he would have paused to re-
flect on the distressing spectacle her eyes
might find in the old kitchen now he did
not stop to think he swept her up and
swung her through the window to him-
self

   tudge be a gent and keep your eyes
on the ceiling counseled mr foster in an
undertone

   look nina on the table  he choked
trying to turn her head with the hand that
he pressed against her cheek  its your
fortune i have been guarding it for you
look

  but she would not turn her head she
set her arms more tightly around his neck
 do you think i can look at anything ex-
cept you now barron i have found you
again i have found you 

   showing that true love whispered mr
fogg to his friend  cant be depended on
to help the barber business she-she
hasnt noticed how much he needs a
shave

  the fact that a girl had entered the grim
place though involuntarily emboldened
constable nute and he came clambering
over the sill squire nile followed

   for gods sake squire pleaded ser-
geant douglass sobbing when he saw this
sturdy stand-by at his side and felt the pat
of the lawyers consoling palm  take them
all in your hands-these troubles-my in-
nocence-take them in your hands

   of course bub dont worry ill take
everything into my hands your own
seem to be pretty well occupied right now
what say

  the squire set himself in command of
that situation with the same decisiveness
that characterized him as the autocrat of
cantons town-meetings


the argosy

  by his orders the gathering throngs out-
side the mansion were kept back from the
window

  men and women and children hurrying
up from the village by the highway and
along the lanes from the farms that sur-
rounded the tingley estate-the flocking
populace arrived and massed in the yard
they stared at the open window-an
empty orifice at which no face appeared-
and wondered what was going on within

  after a time squire nile showed himself
and propped his hands on the sill and quiet-
ed all their murmurings with the command-
ing air he customarily assumed on the town
hall rostrum

   nute he commanded the constable
outside the window after a searching in-
spection of the crowd  pick out two help-
ers and stand ready for your orders

  the red beard of breck blaisdell signaled
that persons presence in the onlookers his
brother was beside him

    theyre here for news-and theyll get
some hot intelligence muttered the law-
yer

  he raised his voice and addressed the
citizens of canton

   listen sharply men and women you
are going to hear something thats bad for
the pride and self-respect of the decent
ones among you but good for the souls of
all of you and let gossip in this town get
a thing right for once

  bitter sarcasm marked his tone  listen
and be ashamed if shame is in you bar-
ron douglass is home again-here in this
house abner sawtell is in this house-
dead by his own hand-and his crimes will
be made known in due course when they
are known you will understand how much
barron douglass has been abused in his old
home

   in this house are two men who know
who robbed and killed swinton tingley
step forward here he called over his
shoulder

  foster and fogg showed impassive faces
at the window

   if two men in the town of canton
didnt get a good look at these faces down
under those pines yonder the night swin-
ton tingley was killed i ask those men

to take that look now ill give em a
chance for closer study nute bring
breck blaisdell and his brother up to this

window

  as if it were a grim afterthought he add-
ed  and whilst youre about it arrest the
blaisdells for the murder and robbery of
swinton tingley i accuse them and ill
be able to back up the charge

  squire nile had staged his little drama
well the surprise was effective 

  constable nute and his helpers went
about their business warily but the broth-
ers did not offer protest or resistance they
stood close to each other when their towns-
people edged away from them this public
sudden amazing denunciation-this ex-
posure of their conscious guilt had stunned
them as a hammer blow stuns an ox that
stands in stupid torpor for a moment before
falling

  in the silence the squire flung this final
advice at the crowd

   better go home you folks and say to
yourselves the things i havent got time to
say

  until late that evening squire nile en-
tertained two select guests in his office

  sergeant douglass held ninas hands
clutched in his broad fist as if he feared
that he might lose her again

  the door of the office was locked but
the windows were open to let the indian
summer blandness in and to permit the
clouds from the squires pipe to escape
the lawyer was at his desk his back con-
siderately turned on the couple he was
docketing various telegrams and the replies
thereto demands sufficiently insistent and
preliminary reports properly -authentic had
availed importantly in temporarily restor-
ing rights to a citizen who had been un-
justly convicted of a crime

   paroled in charge of counsel

  that allowance by the law-a bit irreg-
ular considering the precipitateness of the
demand-ameliorated douglasss condition
till further steps for his complete justifica-
tion could be taken

  at the first opportunity the girl had told
him her story

  she put her fingers across his lips when
the big boss in bronze



he tried to express his complex feelings in
regard to that sacrifice she had rashly of-
fered in his behalf

  she explained that she had fled from the
foot of the wall thinking that she had en-
countered a guard and hoping that all
attention by pursuers would be centered on
her trail

   and why should i not have done so
barron i went with you to help not to
hinder 

   thats the talk my girl commented
the squire over his shoulder -  and if you
could start in that way with a mere convict
it ought to be pretty easy to keep on in the
same way with a good husband eh
what say

  she abandoned her convict promptly
she hurried across the room and kissed
the squires wrinkled cheek on the spot
where douglasss lips had sealed the giving
of that  honor badge of unselfish friend-
ship

  two days afterward the blaisdells con-
fessed in the county jail the squire ex-
pected that they would do so-he pre-
dicted it

   it comes from the psychology of a
guilty conscience that has gnawed and
gnawed until theres nothing left except an
empty shell that still presents a surface
to the sight of men he philosophized
 then one good unexpected wallop caves
it all in abner sawtell caved too after
his own method

  that confession of the blaisdells had
lifted one especial cloud from ninas mind
long troubled by the confused memories of
that tragic night breck blaisdell explain-
ing how the two were trying to save them-

selves from the attack by the crazed miser
said that he had wrested the revolver away
from nina bingham and had used it in
 self-defense

   oh well declared mr foster in his
farewell interview with the squire and
douglass  fogg and i cant expect much
of anything anyway if theres any
chance for us in that new parole law youre
speaking of well and good if-we manage
to get out i guess we can be depended on
to stay good when well blow a safe for
a set of old maids frizzes and let ourselves
be hinkydinked into tossing good money
into the tail-end of a buggy it looks like
we had lost our grip and had got to stay
honest

  on their wedding journey barron doug-
lass and his bride stopped over at the state
capital

  under the benison of a cloudless sky they
sat in the little grove and gazed up at the
bronze face that blessed them with its
serenity

  sergeant douglass stood very straight
and snapped a salute when he and nina
were ready to leave

   its great stuff-the kind that a com-
mander-in-chief like the big boss puts into
a chap nina

   why after i had talked with him here
in the night and the rain i just couldnt
quit

  then he tucked her hand into the crook
of his elbow

   do you mind my asking you to take a
stroll before we go back to the hotel sweet-

heart i want to pay a bill that i owe
down at a tool shop

  the end

keep it in mind till youve read
it and then youll never forget

  naked men of naga

 by gordon maccreagh

begins april 

t				-	-
hby tke wedilor

 ald timer writing from stuyvesant new york while snow-bound suggests
that i  start an argument  as to who is the oldest reader of the argosy
he frankly informs me that he doesnt know where he stands in that respect
himself and asks me to inform him how old a reader of our magazine he must be
from the data that he will be forty-nine next month and remembers reading the
argosy as a small boy with no more definite information than this to build upon
i think he must see the blue ribbon borne off by some other member of-shall i
say our long-distance clientele

     i also have a letter from e l walb oneonta new york who says that he was
a reader of petersons one of the two oldest magazines in america before it was
merged with the argosy in  and has been an argosy reader continuously from
that date i take this opportunity to reply to the query of a correspondent in atlantic
city who wishes to know if the argosy has always been a weekly possibly my
answer that it was started as such december   became a monthly with the
april number  and resumed weekly issue october   may quicken my
stuyvesant friends recollection regarding his own argosy past

	s	

    a grim and a tragic jest it was which made of dan corwin a pariah even to
his own soul spanning the bridge of his dreams in very truth with a ladder of
broken rungs

the butt of neptunes jest

by george mariano

is as its title implies a story of ships and the sea of storm and smooth water yet
fanged with hidden shoals strewn broadcast with the flotsam of scattered hopes
this is drama tense and powerful the sort of a story that grips by reason of its
sheer spell of absorbing human interest the first of six satisfying instalments of
this impressive serial appears in the argosy for april 

g	-jt	s

     in these days of high living costs i imagine that not a few of us would think
twice before refusing a sinecure which paid five  iron men  per diem merely for the
exertion of sleeping in the daytime and the consumption of three well-rounded
 squares  a day this is your introduction to

the graveyard watch

by john d swain

author of  alone in boston etc

our complete novelette for april  and i fancy that it appealed to tim cannon
ex-bounper of the golden calf who however counted without his host or rather
the log-book



hostess in a manner of speaking and as for a visitor or two to his perfectly appointed
residence which in the words of asa white needed only a wife to make it a home
well tim as the saying is found himself speedily a reception committee of one for
as variegated an assortment of battle murder and sudden death as one could well
imagine this is told as only this writer can tell it

s	

     not within my recollection have i been able to offer you so sterling a collection
of short stories of all varieties as in next weeks issue of the argosy in the way
of crime you will find it hard to beat in cleverness the scheme put through by maxwell
smith who wrote  just a little thing a scheme i defy you to divine until
you reach the authors own account of it then in romance there arefew things more
delicate in touch than katharine haviland taylors  and some fell upon
good ground a tale which is likewise permeated with a keen sense of comedy
not often combined with the pathos that rings so true in this striking narrative of two
generations humor and the movies both crop up in  the whiskering chin
quite different yet equally entertaining account of joe conners experiences with the
giles confidential detective agency for which raymond j brown is responsible

complains of a sea story
shortage

boston massachusetts

  just a word to say what i think of the argosy
i have been reading it for the past year but have
never as yet subscribed to it but i hope to do
so soon during the strike i was very much
disappointed in not being able to get my magazine
every week but when they do come i surely do
enjoy many a pleasant evening if i come across
a story or serial i dont like i dont read it but
i know that other people will enjoy it if i dont

  there is only one thing i dont like and that
is there are not enough sea stories i sure would
like to have a good sea serial-story or novelette
rather than short stories detective stories are
usually too dry and uninteresting for me but
cheer up i am not the only one reading your
great magazine in the world

yours for more luck and sea stories h e b

 such knocking i never
saw 

plainfield new jersey

  its a long time since i wrote to the log-book
but things in it now are getting my goat such
knocking i never saw i like all the stories in
the argosy sometimes i strike one that i dont
care for but the book wasnt printed for me
alone there are others that like stories that i
dont so i let it go at that i read the book from
cover to cover-and have taken it since it first
came out some people would kick if they were
playing football

  have just read a letter signed flora watson
morgan and want to say i agree with her and
think she was fine in writing to the boys what
difference if she knew them or not when they
went to fight they didnt go for any special one
but went to fight for all of us

  i had a dear friend in the army over there
who said their letters were the best things they
got just below her letter was one from a soldier
who agrees with this girl from thi west some

                                

              dt

soldier there may be worthless characters in the
army as he insinuates but i know lots of cases
where they come back more of men than when
they went its best to be sure we are all right
ourselves before we criticize others

i guess this letter will never go in the log-
book but i hope it dqes for i hate knocking
why spoil a good book with such punk stuff

lillian m willis

paper too scarce for more
poems now

marion ohio

i buy a copy of each issue of the argosy and
find the stwies very enjoyable but i think this
magazine like so many others of the country
makes a mistake by not publishing more poetry
a couple of pages of good human interest verse
not odes to the moon et cetera but out-of-door
poetry i believe would pay the editor who
thinks that people do not like poetry is fooling
himself i once owned a bookstore and sold
more books of poems than any other line educa-
tors say that poetry is on the increase and the
world certainly needs more true poets

i think the stories in the argosy are fine and
i am just mentioning the publication of more
verse as a suggestion

the columbus evening dispatch publishes a
poem on its editorial page every day and i
know my children look for the poem and it is
usually read out loud before the news is touched

wishing the argosy great success

george chapman

the argosys best and
worst story

st paul minnesota

this is my first attempt as a contributor to the
log-book i have read your magazine for about
five years and the argosy is the best magazine
on the market bar none

now mr editor i have a suggestion to make
would it not be a good idea for readers to express

 
s

the argosy

j their opinion in the log-book as to what was the
best story they ever read in the argosy and
also the poorest the best story that i ever read
was  the golden cat by george f worts
which in my estimation even surpassed zane
greys  last of the duanes  luck by john
frederick was also some tale and i am glad to
hear that there is to be a sequel do not care
much for seltzers stories as he seems to write
in the same rut

  there was one story that was not up to the
argosy requirements and that was edgar frank-
lins  everything but the truth it was the
most foolish and senseless story i have ever read
but i guarantee it would make a great hit on the
stage heres hoping that we have more from
peter moore	paul craig

   everything but the truth  has received more
praise than any other of franklins stories we have
printed but mr craig is of course entitled to his
opinion and i shall be glad to have other candi-
dates join this  best  and  worst  contest

rectifying  rocky 
mountains

albee oregon

   well i guess the joke is on me all right but
i certainly know and have always known as
long as i can remember that i live in the blue
mountains i didnt notice until i saw my letter
in print that i had written rocky instead of
blue and i laughed about it then does that
satisfy you e p b i have lived at least in
sight of these same blue mountains almost my
entire life

  and as for book learning i cant see that it
takes a great deal of that to know where you
live i am not one of the fortunate people who
never make mistakes but i have never yet been
ill-bred enough to write such a letter that i was
ashamed to sign my name to it

  i have read the argosy for about fourteen
years and never realized what it would be to
do without it until it missed coming on account
of the strike we sure did appreciate it when it
started in again

  i am afraid there isnt any fault i can find
in the argosy although there are some stories
that i dont care for but that is to be expected
just finished drag harlan and the golden
cat  a short time ago they were specially good
and i hope that our friend peter moore will
decide again in the near future to visit china
and we will read of his adventures

  with mrs p i w and others i must say i
was very much disappointed in the finish of
 luck although otherwise i liked the story very
much im very glad there is to be a sequel and
i think jack deserved better treatment than she
received in  luck

  i guess i have taken up enough of your time
so will close with the very best wishes for our
friend the argosy mrs chris sturn

still backing its name 

	battle creek michigan

  regarding the fact that i am an old customer
of the good old argosy and also that i have never
had my say-so in the log-book i think it my

duty to contribute to you the plain facts regarding
the same to begin with i am not saying enough
when i say that the argosy is the best magazine
to be had anywhere in our u s a this refers to
your authors also

 the asgosy was my pal when it was the
golden argosy i still remember the stories that
were issued at that time the year  was one
of the many that i distinctly remember if i
would start telling them all i would keep you
reading all night i will say that the argosy still
backs its good faithful name by giving its readers
some of the best reading to be found in this
country

  my friends all read the argosy because they
know a good magazine when they see it will you
please tell me what has become of albert payson
terhune i am anxious to read another story of
his

  i have read the log-book over lots of times
and i find that some people like to kick about this
story and that my opinion is that if i see a story

  do not like i do not say anything because the
same story may more than please some one else
i know positively that the argosy would not
print rotten stories its reputation is too great to
try such a venture the asgosy is still the
greatest of its kind the cleanest wholesome and
most true american stories that are being printed
to-day so tell me where a kicker has any
argument	r b shims

  mr terhune is a very busy man in many lines
but has promised to write us another story as soon
as he can get around to it

writes to tell me that he  missed your wonderful
book for thirty-three months and was glad to get
back to it again a booster who does not wish
her name published from kent ohio avers that
the argosy is not only entertaining but educa-
tional as well the wide scope of the stories
enabling readers to become acquainted with the
people and their customs of many different lands

and proper for girls to powder and admired the
way m which two girls in the january  log

the dollar value of
high school training

 wave you ever thought why

     so many employers demand a
 high school training of their employees-
 why the lack of it bars you from the best
 positions take english and mathematics
 for example what high-grade position-
 such as accounting engineering or execu-
 tive work-can be handled rightly without
 a knowledge of mathematics how can
 costs operating expenses and overhead be
 accurately computed without it how can
 you write good business letters and reports
 or sell goods without a command of english
 there is a positive cash value to having a high
 school training it means many more dollars to
 you because it throws open to you high-grade posi-
 tions from which you are now barred

dont be handicapped

  thousands like you-who were laboring under the
  handicap of not having had a high school training
  -have taken advantage of the american school
  course and removed their handicaps
  this course has been specially prepared for home
  study by noted professors it is complete covers
  all requirements and will remove the biggest
  obstacle between you and success

 if you have already had some part of a high
 school training you can start in exactly where
 you left off well credit you with what you have
 taken and make the tuition fee in proportion with
 the special course you require

 read this guarantee-then act

guarantee at any time during the first year of

the side partner you can trust-

the savage automatic

    its small light unobtrusive you dont notice it in the pocket or
on the belt	

    but when the diamond-back rattler buzzes or the copper-head squirms
-when there s a bear in the trap or a bob-cat in the tree-when the
rare chance of human violence threatens in the wilderness-or when
the stinging wind on the north shore of superior brings the blood-chilling
veil of the man-hunting wolf-pack nearer and nearer-the little savage
proves the closest truest friend

    its barrel-length and locked breech gives more power and accuracy
than other pistols of the calibre-its ten shots and one-hand reloading
permit faster and more continuous fire-and the lines of its celebrated
np mae you point it and shoot it straight in an emergency-as straight
and as instinctively as you point your finger its monkey-wrench sim-
plicity makes it always ready and always sure-fire because like the best
military pistols you can cock and uncock it with your thumb
