the argosy vol xxiv april no the target of fate concerning the mystery that surrounds the early days of john hartfield-the widespread sensation following the chance glimpse of a portrait-developments that shake the town of newcomb to its foundations complete in this issue

chapter i-a bad start

 tt es younger than i thought hed be

          you mean than you thought hed look i guess miss tagford
you know elder brink told us he was thirty three im sure it was a very
excellent sermon he gave us this morning hes smart if he hasnt got many
years over his head  

    kind of sad looking dont you think mrs kingsbury

   mrs porter came up beside the two with this remark she had been just
behind with her husband but had quickened her steps when she found the
couple in front were talking about the new minister miss tagford eagerly
seized upon this tangible subject for further gossip without giving her
companion a chance to reply she spoke across her 

    oh good morning mrs porter now you mention it it was sadness i
saw in his eyes wonder what it can be a young man like him too so
well favored and got a charge just as soons hes out of the seminary did
you hear elder brink say as hed had any family trouble mrs kingsbury
here here let the poor man rest for a while now it must have been
hard enough for him to get up and face all these people for the first time
without havin em all pick him to pieces like a pack of vultures

   bluff good natured deacon porter had forced his way in among the trio
in front of him and grasping his wifes arm proceeded to hurry her on
ahead

     richard   she said in her emphatic tone of disapproval

    miss tagford began to giggle while a faint color suffused itself over mrs
kingsburys face and brow she hated gossip above all things she was
glad her gate was so close at hand with a curt  good morning  to miss
tagford she turned in and hurried up the pathway to the house

the gentle may breeze stirred the leaves of a cherry tree standing in the
front yard and showered her with its wealth of white blossoms she caught

one of them in her hand and glanced from it to the young girl who had just
come to the doorway and stood there waiting for her it seemed as though
she was comparing the two

    well mother how was he 

   grace kingsbury smiled as she spoke that smile of welcome she never
failed to give her mother even when they had been separated for only so
short a time as had been the case that morning

    i wish you had gone grace i cant begin to tell you how much i
think of him we all liked him how is father 

   the last query was as unfailing between these two women as the smile of
welcome

    hes just dropped asleep we were listening to the singing of the last
liymu do you know mother that always seems as much a sign of spring to
me as a bluebird or the finding of a crocus does i mean the being able to
hear the singing from the church through the open windows did you meet
mr hartfield  did anybody introduce tou   

   no hush grace there he comes now that tall young man with
mrs colgate

   the girl turned to look but at that instant there came a call from inside
of  grace  

   yes father and she was back in the sitting room bending over the
pallid faced sufferer on the lounge

   the people of newcomb took it as a matter of course ihat the new min-
ister should go home for his first sunday dinner with the colgates indeed
nobody else had thought of inviting him mr colgate was the leading mer-
chant in the town in olden times he would have been called   the squire  
he lived in a great house surmounted by a hideous mansard roof capped
with a gilded railing and surrounded by spacious grounds dotted here and
there with an iron figure of a deer or lion which the more simple minded of
the townspeople looked upon as marvels of beauty and grew to regard as the
very badge of wealth

   mrs colgate was a meek little woman who never seemed to grow accus-
tomed to the moner that had come to them she spoke but seldom as if
fearful of saying the wrong thing but her taciturnity was more than atoned
for by her husband and son

   hartfield had heard about the colgates through elder brink and so lie
had been in a measure prepared for them he knew that mr colgate was
the financial pillar of the church of which he and his wife were also mem-
bers when he received that invitation to dinner after his first service he
personally wanted to decline

   it was the first sermon he had ever preached to a regular congregation
his nerves were tingling yet from the force he had thrown into it he
wanted to go back to the quiet parsonage and think it all over by himself to
try and realize that he john hartfield was actually embarked on a career
which had any one predicted it for him five years before he would have
rated as among the impossibilities

   but he soon saw that the colgates would be offended if he did not go
the target of fate



mr colgate liad met him at the station the night before with his carriage
he had seen that his baggage was taken to the parsonage and in other ways
had been extremely kind how tiresome he was though 

     fine congregation we had this morning mr hartfield he said as they
walked off together  you ought to feel complimented upon my word
i shall feel more complimented if i have as big an audience tonight
curiosity over a novelty accounted for the crowd this morning you know
mr colgate winced a little at this he never went to church at night
himself he considered it beneath his dignity as the leading man of the
village to show himself in public too often he eased his conscience in this
matter by telling the sexton that his well located pew was at the disposal of
any one who might care to occupy it

    ha ha he laughed now evading the point at issue  i see you are
exceedingly modest well i suppose that is right for a young man just
starting out in life

    the patronage conveyed in these words stung john hartfield to the quick
the implication was that thomas colgate had earned the right to display
pride in his achievements the minister buried the finger tips of his right
hand deep in his palm and placed his other on his clerical cut vest as if to re-
adjust his tie it was at this moment they were passing the kingsbury
cottage mr colgate took off his hat and bowed with more than usual cere-
mony to mrs kingsbury he wished her not to fail to note that he had the
new ministers company

   who is that asked hartfield when they had passed she has a
sweet face that looks as though it had seen a deal of suffering i noticed
her in church she seemed to be very attentive

   mr colgate turned a sharp look on his companion

    oh then you do have time to pay heed to what your congregation is
doing while you are preaching he said this half laughingly but with a
vivid recollection of his tendency to somnolency about the time  thirdly
was reached then without waiting for a reply he went on that is
mrs kingsbury her husband was injured in the war and has been an inva-
lid ever since they live on his pension

   yes mr hartfield mrs colgate broke in here you never saw
more devotion than that mother and daughter pay that man one of them
is always with him thats the reason grace was not in church this morning

                                                                         o

i suppose she will be out tonight they live so near she can just run in
ala thinks shes the prettiest girl in town peyton colgate volunteered
at this point  but she isnt in it with kate barclay to my mind

     peyton   said his mother in the strictest tone she ever assumed

    mr colgate proceeded ignoring the interruption of his son whose hits of
slang it may be stated did not jar on him as they did on his wife he had
a feeling that they made the boy more like city bred youths

    the kingsburys are very worthy people to be sure they have not
much of this worlds goods but then what they cant contribute in money to
the work of the church they give in service oh miss tagford good
morning  


the target of fate

   after she had been deserted by both the porters and mrs kingsbury the
gossip loving old maid knowing that mr hartfield would presently be along
with the colgates had lingered on the path till she heard them coming then
turned and stopped the merchant with 

   ah mr colgate i would like to speak to you one minute if you
please  

   all she had to say was to express a hope that her cow which he had
given her permission to pasture in his meadow did not annoy him but it
afforded her the opportunity for the coveted introduction to the minister
which she acknowledged with a sweeping courtesy and a lowering of the
eyes in maidenly shyness

   affliction had not been blessed to miss caroline tagford her lover had
died two weeks before their marriage and her disposition had been soured
ever since she was always envying other people their good luck and trying
to find flaws in their characters she was forty six but her discontented
disposition gave her face a querulous expression which made her look older

   she now had no hesitation in joining herself to mr colgate and the min-
ister and walking with them toward elm street she was sorry that almost
everybody was going the same way there was less chance of her meeting
friends and  showing off the company she wras in

    how do you like newcomb mr hartfield  she began with the little
titter that succeeded so many of her speeches

    as ive only been here half a day miss tagford im as yet hardly pre-
pared to state it wouldnt do for me to be like the foreign actresses who
are interviewed by the new york reporters before they are half way up the
harbor  

    actresses   miss tagford repeated the word in accents of mingled hor-
ror and mystification

   mr colgate looked his astonishment and peyton who had lingered with
the group in the rear to see the fun of  carrie tagford making up to the
minister   emitted a half suppressed whistle a quick pallor overspread
hartfields face succeeded by a wave of crimson as he replied  well
perhaps i should include all notable people from europe authors and lec-
turers who are asked how they like america before they have set foot on its
soil

   miss tagford looked as if she was trying to decide whether she had been
insulted or not it was not quite clear to her mind what mr hartfield meant
but he had certainly used the word actresses a term which respectable folk
in newcomb very seldom permitted to pass their lips and here was the
minister employing it 

   she had not reached her own gate yet but she suddenly decided she would
prefer slipping off and going up king street to tell delia mullins that the
new minister was mighty queer to continuing her walk with him with a
short  good morning mr hartfield and more cordial adieux to the
colgates she turned away her small mind full to bursting of the new im-
pressions she had taken into it

   hartfield meantime still kept two white teeth pressing against his under
the target of fate



lip he wished more ardently than ever for the seclusion of the parsonage
he realized that he had committed an indiscretion a very trifling one to be
sure but he well knew how with one in his position molehills would be mag-
nified into mountains but by this time they had reached the colgate place
and in the pride of displaying its attractions to his guest its owner forgot
what had puzzled him in that little speech about actresses

    here we are he announced with as much of a flourish as intonation
can give to speech

   hartfield knew that he was expected to be impressed and he was-by
the bad taste everywhere visible the iron groups on the grass already
alluded to were atrocious enough but directly in front of the door was an
immense glazed ball resting in a tripod and reflecting on its mirror-like sur-
face a flower bed of fish geraniums laid out in the shape of the letter c and an
iron bench placed under an evergreen that was more suggestive of a cemetery
lot than anything else hartfield could call to mind

   you have a beautiful lawn mr colgate he said

   this was true vulgar love of display could find nothing to work upon
in the grass which was a deep green and freshly cut

   but its a great care mr hartfield a great care rejoined the mer-
chant

   and then he threw open the front door with the air of one who said  if
you admire the outside what must you think of this   pretentious chromos
adorned the walls the parlor was crowded so full of furniture heavily up-
holstered that its atmosphere was stuffy almost to suffocation and hartfield
hailed with delight mr colgates suggestion that peyton should take the
minister up to one of the spare rooms that he might make ready for dinner

   peyton colgate was just eighteen-old enough to think himself a man
but with not sufficient sense to pass for one he had been indulged by his
father from infancy and did pretty much as he liked most of the time he
never failed to recollect that the governor was the magnate as he
would have termed it himself of newcomb consequently he stood in no
awe of any one else whom he met in the town the new minister was young
younger looking than he really was as has been said  he wore a mustache
and did not look a bit sanctimonious like old dr bemis his predecessor in the
charge  then his remark about actresses had fired peyton with the determi-
nation to draw him out

   he began the process when he had ushered their guest into a pink and
blue bedroom and pointed to the pitcher and basin on the stand between the
windows

   have you ever been in new york he commenced perching him-
self on one of the window sills where he could look into his companions face
as he prepared for his ablutions

    yes was the guarded answer

   you quite shocked miss tagford by what you said about actresses
went on peyton with a laugh theyre awfully poky in this town- we
never have any shows here except the circus once a year i spose youve
been to the theatre-i mean of course before you were a minister 


the target of fate

    before peyton liad quite finished his question hartfield had plunged his
face into the basin of water when he was in condition for speech again he
took the initiative and began to question peyton about his school and
whether he was going to college or not

    young colgate managed to get the lead again on the last named subject
and as they were going down stairs inquired from what college hartfield had
graduated

     oh i went to columbia answered the minister after the briefest pos-
sible hesitation-a pause of which peyton thought nothing at the time

    he decided that mr hartfield was not going to turn out such jolly com-
pany as he thought he might and much to that gentlemans relief withdrew
his attentions from him for the rest of his stay at the house

     so this is jour first charge said mr colgate patronizingly as he got
up to carve the roast beef

    hartfields foot twitched uneasily under the table he wondered if  the
leading merchant  of newcomb realized that he was talking to a man thirty
three years old and not to a boy of ten before he had time to reply mrs
colgate with womans tact broke in with 

     it must be hard for you to come away among strangers like this mr
hartfield where is your home i dont know as i heard

     i was born and brought up in new york mrs colgate i think i shall
not be homesick in newcomb however i shall have my work to fill my
thoughts you know

     but that parsonage is such a great barracks of a place for one man to
live in went on the hostess  dr bemis had a large family you know i
am afraid you will get homesick there

     oh dont worry about hartfield lucinda it wont be long before hell
pick out a wife from among our pretty newcomb girls and then therell be
no fear of homesickness

   mr colgate shook with the laughter this suggestion caused him pey-
ton too seemed greatly to enjoy it and even ventured to name over a few
desirable candidates till checked by his mother who poor woman flushed
almost as deeply as did hartfield

    the latter wtas thankful that sunday school was at three oclock thus
giving him a chance to leave immediately after dinner to go home and prepare
for the address he would be expected to deliver he breathed a long sigh of
relief when he turned out of the grounds

     im afraid fve made a bad start he muttered to himself as he walked
quickly off toward the parsonage

chapter ii-the two portraits

   the manse belonging to the presbyterian church in newcomb had been
left to the organization by mrs coombes who died the last of her line it
was a room- old house standing in the midst of an ample garden whose trees
were now white and pink with blossoms when dr bemis went away
catherine who had been cook of the family was asked to stay and take care
the target of fate



of things till his successor had arrived and now that he turned out to be a
bachelor it was arranged that the old woman should remain in the capacity
of cook and housekeeper

   hartfield was delighted with the place there was plenty of room for
the great stac of ixjoks he had brought and a large apartment on the upper
floor which he at once transformed into a gymnasium thither he resorted
now when he arrived from the colgates throwing off his coat he closed
the door and then proceeded to pummel with all his might a sandbag which
he had suspended from the ceiling the night before

     how shocked they would be he reflected with a smile  if they could
see me prepare in this way for my address to the children  but i must have

some outlet how i ha-		r

   he checked himself suddenly he stepped back quickly out of the way
of the swinging bag both arms at his side he put his coat on again and
went slowly down the stairs to the room he had elected to make his study
he remained here a few moments in quiet meditation then started as the
ringing of the church bell broke on his ear he picked up his hat and
hurried off to the session of the sunday school

    elder briitk was standing in the churchyard evidently waiting for him
he was the chairman of the cqjnmittee that had secured hartfields services
from the seminary he was a plain man but sincere and of kindly nature

     i thought youd feel a little strange about goin in alone he said now
as he shook hands  if you hadnt been with mr colgate id have stopoed
at the parsonage for you

   thank you mr brink you are very thoughtful eet me see who
did you say was your superintendent   

     mr ranger hes a young man but he keeps the school in first class
shape come in and ill introduce you to him

    five minutes later hartfield was seated on the platform quietly taking
his observations of the school while the superintendent conducted the opening
exercises ore face among the lady teachers arrested his attention there
was a trace of familiarity about it and yet he was sure that he had never seen
the girl before she was very young evidently not yet twenty but there
was a sweetness of expression in her face almost a pathos that gave to it a
touch of deeper maturity

   he made his address and then during the half hour assigned for the
study of the lesson he started out under mr rangers guidance to make
the personal acquaintance of the scholars and teachers when he reached the
class whose teacher he had been observing he started at mention of the
name  miss kingsbury

     now i know where i have seen you he said with a smile as he shook
hands

     seen me  she repeated  i wasnt at church this morning

    no but j our mother was you do not look like her perhaps but there
is something ir your face that reminded me very strongly of her

     i am glad to hear you say that mr hartfield mother and i are very
fond of each other


the target of fate

   the minister then proceeded to make the acquaintance of the girls in the
class when the session was over there was a general gathering about the
platform and a disposition manifested to organize an informal little reception
the minister was certainly a very attractive man fully six feet in height
with an erect carriage and a face both strong and good looking it was no
wonder the ladies were all eager to get better acquainted with him but
grace kingsbury did not linger she had promised to return home as soon
as school was over she knew her mother would be anxious to hear about
it 

   miss tagford was not connected with the school but this afternoon she
could not resist putting on her hat and running around there j ust about dis-
missing time

   delia mullins had declared up and down that she didnt believe the minis-
ter had said anything he oughtnt to say about actresses

   you know the way you have of magnifying things caroline she con-
cluded on which miss tagford had bridled up and taken a speedy departure
with the parting admonition that all miss mullins had to do was to wait and
see

   miss tagford growing tired of waiting herself had now sallied forth to
do a little more seeing it so chanced that she met grace kingsbury just as
the latter was leaving the churchyard

    was the minister out to sunday school  she inquired putting out a
detaining hand to stop grace who would have hurried on with only a bow

    yes

      did you meet him   

    yes we were all introduced

      how do you like him   

   very much he seems to take a real interest in everything connected
with the church

    i dont mean that how do you like him to talk to  do you think he
acts much like a minister ought to act   

   why miss tagford what do you mean of course he acts like a
minister

    i dont think so talking about actresses and all that but i want to
see mr ranger a minute and must be going and miss tagford went on into
the sunday school room before grace could ask for an explanation of her
words

     what could she mean    the girl reflected as she continued on her way
home  but then it wont do to put much faith in what she says still
how did she happen to think of that   

   grace told her mother of the pleasant interview she had had with mr
hartfield mrs kingsbury was both pleased and surprised to hear that he
had noticed her in church

    i want you to hear him preach grace she said  it just seems as if
he was talking right out of his heart  

    so the girl herself thought that night when she went to service there was
an unusually large congregation for the evening mrs colgate was out with
the target of fate



peyton and more than the customary number of young men with their sweet-
hearts but grace kingsbury was alone she had always been of a retiring
disposition she had many admirers among the youths of newcomb but
they all fancied her more than she did them and as she did not think it honest
not to show this they soon ceased the effort to show her attention besides
her whole heart was given to those at home her invalid father for whom she
was staff amanuensis reader soother of pain and the mother was to her like
a sister almost she did not feel the need of companionships outside of these
and of that which her work in the sunday school furnished her

   now as she sat there in the short pew the kingsburys rented her eyes
fixed on the new ministers face as he preached the  old old story  in away
that made it seem new to her she was conscious of a strong desire to know
better this man who was so different from those with whom she was com-
monly brought in contact she found her thoughts unconsciously straying
back to the afternoon when he had told her she reminded him of her mother
even though he had smiled as he spoke there was a sadness in his eyes she
wondered if lie had lost his own mother recently he did not seem like a

man who would care to talk about himself but she would like to hear-

    now a brief moment of devotion

   grace gave a guilty start the sermon was ended in the midst of her
thoughts that had wandered from it to the preacher she bowed her head
and gently chided herself when they rose to sing the last hymn she kept
her eyes fixed on the book although the words were perfectly familiar to her

   after the benediction she started to hurry home as she always did but
half way down the aisle mrs porter stopped her with a message to take to
her mother about the sewing society while she was talking with her a
a voice just behind her said  good evening miss kingsbury

   it was mr hartfield he had his hat in his hand a crowd immediately
gathered about him but as he saw grace making her way out of it he bent
toward her and added  if you will allow me i should be glad to walk to
j our gate with you  

   a faint flush came into her cheeks

    i am not-you are very kind she replied the flush deepening a little
it was so unexpected that she scarcely knew how to reply

   mr hartfield said a general good night and followed her to the door

   i-i hope you didnt think that you ought to see me home because i
was alone began grace  newcomb isnt a city and we live close by

      no i did it because-because i wanted to  

   it was his turn to hesitate now but he went on quickly

    i have heard about you all and if it is not too late i should like to meet
your mother and father i have made the acquaintance of most of my people
today-a great many after church this morning  

    yes mother will be very glad to see you you know we cant both go
out together on account of father he is an invalid  

   by this time they had reached the cottage  mother here is mr hart-
field said grace as she pushed open the door

   the eyes of the sufferer on the lounge lighted up he had not dared to
io

the target of-fate

hope for this-to see so soon the new minister about whom everybody was
talking hartfield in his turn enjoyed the call brief though he made it
very much the kingsburys were in such contrast to the colgates quiet
people with bookish tastes consorting with them suggested other themes
of converse than themselves or their neighbors

   the minister went away feeling refreshed in spirit it was a happy ending
of a hard day when he reached the parsonage he did not go up to the top
floor and pummel the sand bag he threw himself on the lounge in his study
without lighting the lamp and clasping his hands behind his head lay there
thinking

   it was not going to be such plain sailing as he had hoped his three
years in the seminary had not entirely obliterated his old self he recalled
the slip he had made in talking with miss tagford what an insignificant
thing it was  and yet he knew that it had made a deep impression on those
who heard it miss tagford would be inclined to watch him closely here-
after

   mr colgate too he feared he had antagonized somewhat in spite of his
good resolutions to bear with him and suddenly he recollected a woman
with a little child by the hand who had waited to be introduced to him after
morning service there was a crowd about him at the time he had shaken
hands and said he was glad to know her but had not spoken to the little girl
he had a dim recollection now of having seen the child pushed toward him
but mr colgate had come up at that minute and his attention had been
diverted the same woman-he could not recall her name now-had been
out at evening service the little child was with her again and had gone to
sleep he feared now that the mother had waited for him once more but
he had been in a hurry to speak to grace kingsbury and had given her no
chance for another interview

   and that walk home with miss kingsbury  he wtondered if there would
be any one to call him to account for that but he would insist on being
permitted a certain line of independence he realized however that it
would not be prudent for him to go home with her again the following
sunday

   presently he rose struck a light and went out into the hall to unlock one
of his trunks from it he took a small plush case containing several photo-
graphs selecting two of these he took them back into the study with him
and sitting down by the table held them up in front of him and gazed at
them intently

   they wrere the portraits of a young man and woman both very young
apparently the woman who was in evening dress was very beautiful
the man was hartfield himself he was in full dress too and there was a
sort of roguish smile about the lips

   for fully five minutes hartfield gazed at these two pictures then putting
them face downward on the table he leaned his head on his hand and mur-
mured softly  yes the same the same i must not forget that

   he rose put the photographs back in the plush case then placed this in
a drawer of the desk which he locked then he took a book from the library
the target of fate

and read until after ten when he started to retire ashe passed through the
silent halls mrs colgates words at dinner recurred to him and now
somehow he felt as if there was some truth in them the place did seem
great and barrack-like to shelter him alone

      but i am not worth of anything else i must not think of it   he told
himself

   when he reached his bed chamber he went to the window and threw the
shutters open there was no moon but the stars were bri ght

   he sat down on the window sill and was reminded of peyton colgate as
he did so

    i wonder if that boy suspects he mused  but he cant its only
a fancy of mine but there was that slip about actresses i must be ever on
the alert even such a little thing weighs as a great one now

   he sighed took one more look at mars glowing red in the heavens then
closed the shutters

chapter iii-the proposal

   in a fortnights time the new minister became the talk of the town and
this is not solely because he proved to be a popular preacher and filled the
church at both services there was another reason than this and it lay in
the fact that his own congregation was divided in its opinions concerning him
by far the greater number liked him and right royally espoused his cause
but they did not succeed in winning over the prejudiced ones

   hes too easy mannered for a minister said old mrs sleeper
havent you seen him when he bows to a woman on the street it
aint right for a servant of the lord to take his hat off the way mr
hartfield does it 

   an he keeps a fast horse over at the hankinses liver stable this
from miss tagford who had treasured up this bit of news that she might
spring it upon the assembled ladies of the sewing circle he nearly run
over me the other night when i was crossing the street  

     hes got money of his own i hear tell put in mrs porter

     hed better put it into bibles for the heathen than horseflesh for his own
pleasure mrs robbins frowned darkly over the seam she was stitching as
she spoke she had never forgiven hartfield for not noticing dora with her
beautiful flaxen curls that first sunday

   he gave me ten dollars for our missionary fund the other da mrs
kingsbury ventured to interpose

   there was no reply made to this except a sort of  umph  uttered by
two or three of those present miss tagford among them in spite of
hartfields care his attentions to grace kingsbury were already the occasion
of remark

    hes doing lots of good i think now spoke up mrs brink who was
a little hard of hearing she had not quite caught the drift of the last
remarks but knew that they were talking about the minister  we never
had such big congregations before  


the target of fate

      but what do people come for mostly    retorted mrs robbins like
theyd go to a show he stands there in the pulpit an dont have even the
bible in front of him an talks away fast as he can about the lord loving
everybody even the wicked of course people like to hear that they
think they can go on being wicked just the same and then step in at the
eleventh hour

   oh mrs robbins broke in mrs kingsbury i dont think mr
hartfield means to preach that doctrine

    i cant help what he means to do im only tellin of what he does
  did you hear what he said at the funeral of mr hobson the other
day  remarked a woman with a thin nose and sharp lips who had not yet
spoken

    no no what was it   there was a general dropping of work into
laps and an eager leaning forward of heads even of those who had never
professed any hostility toward the new pastor

    why he said that while mr hobson may have lived a life of the world
there was no limit to gods mercy wasnt that dreadful to say right before
the widow too  

     what to let her think her husband had a chance of being saved   in-
quired delia mullins

    no to talk as if there was any doubt about it dont speak nothin
but good of the dead says the proverb

but mr hobson was a very wicked man observed mrs kingsbury
 ive heard him scoff at churches and sunday schools myself i think it was
very thoughtful in mr hartfield to try and give the widow a little comfort
thjs was a little deep for caroline tagford she was anxious to bring the
conversation back within the line of her own comprehension

     catharine batters says hes got a place fixed up in the third story of
the parsonage like an acrobats in a circus theres a bag of some sort
hanging there and he goes up sometimes and punches it just as if he wished
it was a mans head

   miss tagfords announcement created all the stir she could have wished
for as yet the newest gymnastic appliances had not penetrated to newcomb

    i dont see what the committee was thinkinof when they engaged a man
like him observed mrs robbins speaking in a discreetly lowered tone so
that mrs brink should not hear ive heard some of the baptists say
they thought hed split the church yet

    but the men all like him spoke up mrs porter the baptists are
only envious because their minister cant draw as a big a crowd my richard
says he just enjoys sunday cornin round so he can hear mr hartfield preach
again

    mr colgate dont appear to enjoy him much rejoined she of the thin
lips mrs mason   he never comes to prayer meeting any more and wasnt
in church last sunday im sure we dont want to lose him we cant
afford it i-ie gives to all our societies

     not any more than mr hartfield does himself put in mrs kingsbury
 we never had a minister that was so liberal
the target of fate



    i wonder where he gets his money said mrs robbins  hes mighty
close mouthed about his family affairs he dont get many letters sam
down at the post office tells me

    it seems to me observed delia mullins that we havent got any-
thing to do with his family or auj of that hes doing more good than dr
bemis did  

     my delia mullens how can you talk like that  

   a sort of shudder of horror ran through the group of malcontents now
that dr bemis was gone he was elevated to a kind of pedestal in their
memories he had left because he could not bring up his large family on the
small salary the church paid

   wait till the next communion said mrs mason oracularly  then
well see

   they did wait and saw ten young men and four young ladies brought into
the church as a rule this order under previous pastorates had been
reversed more women than men were added to the rolls but as mrs
porter observed mr hartfield was a great favorite with the male portion of
the congregation they were all glad to have him call upon them at their
stores and with the young men especially he was in great demand he
helped them organize an association of their own and it was from this mainly
that the new members had been recruited

   the church had certainly never been in a more prosperous condition
even mr colgates lukewarm interest in its affairs since the new ministers
advent did not affect its financial standing mr hartfields liberality count-
erbalanced the merchants falling off in generosity and the contributions to
the various boards showed no decrease

   but as the young mens association prospered and a boys club was
undertaken in connection therewith mr hartfield became earnestly desirous
to build or rent a structure as a sort of club house for the latter to this
end he proposed that the young men get up an entertainment to be held in
the town hall

     if you can get some talent in the musical line he told them  i will
agree to give a short lecture on some popular subject

   the members of the association took hold of the work with enthusiasm
and on the appointed evening the hall was crowded at fifty cents a head it
wasnt the music that had attracted the throng either it was the anticipation
of a rare treat in hearing the popular young pastor lecture he had not
announced his subject beforehand and when he stepped to the front of the
platform and stated that he would give the boys and their friends some idea
of cowboy life on the plains of texas there was a ripple of excitement
through the rows of seats

    and what a   talk   that wtas  his gestures were as eloquent as his
tongue  he acted out many of the scenes he described with consummate
ability one could almost imagine himself on the wide prairies of the done
star state astride of a bucking bronco with a stampeded herd of cattle on
one side and a hostile band of indians charging down upon the other the
applause when he had finished fairly shook the building
h

the target of fate

   the boys especially were delighted it was fortunate the lecture was the
last thing on the program they could have never remained quietly in their
seats to listen to anything else but mrs robbins mrs mason miss
tagford and a few others were scandalized they went about for days there-
after with uplifted hands declaring that they were never so shocked in their
lives as when they saw their minister cutting up monkey tricks in public
like a mountebank

   why he almost swore there once or twice mrs robbins affirmed
 im so glad i didnt take my dora

   of course mr hartfield did not fail to hear some of these comments
but they moved him not at all he was surer of himself now than when he
first arrived in newcomb he could not help seeing that a great deal of
good was being done under his ministry he determined that he would not
allow a few grumblers to disturb him

   his intimacy with the kingsburys had been quietly progressing with a
riper acquaintance his admiration for grace deepened into something that he
was almost fearful of analyzing

   im not worthy he would murmur to himself in the solitude of his
study when the theme would insist on intruding itself into his mind to
have saved myself  so as by fire  is enough without seeking to permit the
smell of the smoke to touch the garments of another  

   tate in june mr kingsbury died  the mother and daughter were left
alone in his capacity as pastor he was necessarily ofteuer at the cottage
after-this event than had been his custom he found himself regretfully be
it added drawn more and more each day to the sweet girl whose fine charac-
ter shone more beautiful in this hour of affliction

   but hartfield was not as a rule a sociable man that was one of the
objections the discor ented spirits raised against him they said he wras not
enough of a shepherd-that he didnt go round and visit the lambs of the
flock

   but hes roped in a lot of the buttin old goats irreverent jimmy
clarkson the bar room loafer observed when he heard about it

   indeed so magnetic a power did mr hartfield appear to exercise over the
men of the town that jimmy sometimes trembled in his shoes for fear he
might be subjected to the influence himself and turned into a decent man

   the minister electrified the congregation one morning by reminding them
after the sermon that paul said there were  diversities of gifts he added
that while he hoped neter to fail in his duty to the widow and the fatherless
he had not proposed to become a social pastor

    unrph he might well say he dont fail in his duty to the widow and the
fatherless commented mrs robbins  but he lets that scheming mrs
kingsbury and her daughter stand for the whole lot of em

   whether it was because this speech came to his ears or not certain it was
that for several weeks mr hartfield kept studiously away from the
kingsbury cottage he saw grace and her mother every sunday at church
and on wednesday night at prayer meeting at one of these last services
towards the end of the summer grace came alone it was a very hot night
the target of fate



aud but few people were out during elder brinks prayer low thunder
mutterings could be heard and when dismissal time came the rain was falling
in torrents mrs mason who lived some distance from the church had
come in a covered wagon

     get in with me and ill take you home she said to three or four of the
ladies

   they were glad to avail themselves of the invitation and the carriage
presently drove off leaving grace kingsbury the only woman left to peer
anxiously out into the darkness to see if there was no chance of a cessation
in the downpour

   i have an umbrella in the pulpit room let me get it and take you
home  

   mr hartfield had come up with outstretched hand

   before she could reply he had gone out through the door that gave
entrance to the church he was back in half a minute with the umbrella
when they reached the porch of the cottage

   im ever so much obliged mr hartfield said grace wont you
come in a while  mother has gone to bed she was quite worn out with the
heat today

   hartfield as he accepted the invitation and stepped into the hallway
experienced a sort of fierce joy in his heart he had not realized till this
moment when chance had given him this unexpected tete-a-tete with the
girl how endeared she had become to him they spoke on commonplace
matters for the first few minutes somehow a sort of restraint seemed to be
upon them both tonight-a restraint that impelled them not to be silent but
to talk animatedly  subjects of alocal nature to which they did not as a
rule pay much attention but a reference to the progress the young men
were making with their boys club gave grace the opportunity to remark
that this gratifying result was entirely owing to the sympathy hartfield gave
them in all their efforts working with them as if he were one of themselves

      i think that is one of the principal reasons why you make such a suc-
cessful minister she added

   do you really think i make a success of my work miss kingsbury
frankly now  

    hartfields voice had taken on a serious tone in marked contrast to the
lighter one in which till now they had both been speaking

     yes i most certainly do think so mr hartfield

    but there are those who do not agree with you i am not blind to the
fact that i have estranged several people in the church was it so in dr
bemis time  did he have so many enemies as i  

    no but neither did he have so many friends his character was not
positive enough to make enemies he was too easy to get along with you
know there have been as many additions in the three months you have been
here as in a whole year under him

   there was silence for an instant without the rain beat on the tin
roof of the porch with a continuous roar and the thunder was almost in-
cessant but gradually growing less loud then hartfield went on 


the target of fate

    you said a little while ago that i was sympathetic if that is so how
does it come about that i have made so many of the people here dissatisfied
with me   

    because you dont appeal to their natures which are too narrow to take

in the-the- grace paused and dropped her eyes she realized that

what she was about to add would be an expression of her own personal
opinion of the minister

    but i ought to reach them in some way he broke in apparently
ignoring her unfinished sentence am i too proud too anxious to have
my own way in everything  remember i have no one to advise me in these
matters i cant talk to some members of the church about others that
is not in the way that i can talk with you

   grace kingsburys heart throbbed quickly for weeks she had recog-
nized the fact that her feeling for this man was a deeper one than belonged to
one who was simply her pastor with all the powers at her command she
had sought to hide this fact from the eyes of the world from the knowledge
of her mother even from herself he was too far above her for her to dare
to hope her eyes dropped to the floor again now as he spoke the last words
she was afraid of what he might see in them even by the dim light of the one
lamp that was standing on the center table

   the rain was now falling more lightly the thunder had almost ceased

   hartfield rose  i ought to be going he said

    no

   there was a pleading note almost a beseeching one in graces voice but
she rose too hartfield took a step nearer to her

    i do not want to go he went on  but-grace can you not see that
you fill my heart  i want you to take it and direct its purposes will
you  

   he bent his head towards hers she was still looking down suddenly
she raised her eyes the blended love and happiness that hartfield read in
them thrilled him through and through

    am i worthy to do this  she said softly

   his answer was to fold her in his arms

    it is i who am the unworthy one grace dear he whispered  my
past is still back of me all the good that i do in the present cannot blot that
out of my memory will you take me on trust for wdiat i am for what i
mean to be  

    i trust you fully-love and honor you with all my lifart is not that
enough   

chapter iv-the insistent past

   the clock in the episcopal belfry was tolling ten when hartfield left the
kingsbury cottage he walked quickly through the deserted streets he
was not in a hurry to get back to the parsonage for any special work awaiting
him there it seemed that he must move rapidly or be left behind by the
tumultuous rush of his thoughts
the target of fate	

    it had stopped raining and the air was much cooler than it had been before
the storm here and there the clouds had parted exposing patches of starry
sky to view hartfield noticed one of these and recalled the night he had sat
in the window and looked up at the heavens at the close of his first day in
newcomb

    did i imagine then he asked himself  that i would do what i have
done tonight   

   the parsonage had never seemed so quiet to him as it did now when he
entered it

    but there will be life here soon he murmured  and happiness-and
love

    there was a pallor  his face in the darkness that seemed to belie the
silent words on his lips he went to his own room and sat down in a chair
by the open window

    she loves me this was his thought  i should never have said what
i did had i not seen that and then-ah i am but human-my own love
hurried me on and now i am bound to her while-

   he shut his lips tightly together his fingers clinched and unclinched
themselves

   the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children aye they are
visited upon themselves and bitter are the fruits but she trusts me yes
but if she knew all what then  would she recoil from me say that i had
deceived her that i was not worthy of any womans love not worthy to teach
others the way of truth and duty 

   a look of anguish came into his face the perspiration was thick upon
his forehead but he seemed to take no note of it

     and i was so happy for a little while tonight when i forgot  but how
could i forget  is not my present manner of living in such a contrast to
what i had planned for myself a constant reminder of the reason for it  ah
but love is blind and deaf everything but dumb for it can cause the dullest
to frame in words the passions in the breast can hurry on to an avowal him
who has no right to speak

    striving to bring his mind down to quieter contemplation he endeavored
to recall in their order all the events of the evening from the moment when
he had offered to escort grace kingsbury home then he tried to realize
what would be his feelings if he had become conscious that the girl cared for
him and had himself remained silent

     ought i to cause her to suffer for a sin that was all my own  and now
that i have committed myself must i become a trifler go and tell her after i
have made her put into words her love that i cannot take it-because
because of a rash act once in my life  and then we shall both suffer her
faith mayhap will be tried and i-i shall be like a ship at sea without its
guiding star i shall despise myself nor dare even again stand in that pulpit
and speak to the people i have sought to help  

    he leaned forward till his chin rested in the palm of his hand his eyes
were still fixed on the heavens across which white clouds were now skurry-
iug as if hastening to remove all traces of the storm and prepare a flawless
i

the target of fate

sky for the morrow the winds that caused these to speed along also stirred
the leaves of the oak that grew up just outside the window the gentle
rustling seemed in some sense to hartfield a companionship the sounds
carried him far back to the days of his boyhood when he used to imagine
that all the silent forces of nature had voices with which they could speak to
those human beings whose ears were attuned to comprehend them he had
been wont to make up long stories of what the winds and the waves the roll
of the thunder and the rippling of the mountain brook would talk to him
about

   recalling this brought back to him other memories of his boyhood-of
that young boyhood when all was innocence and trust when the world seemed
so big and to look forward to when he would be a man appeared like peering
into the future of some other person who had not yet been born and it was
just this way now when he looked back not one of the great things he had
planned to do had he brought to accomplishment instead-what did he see
on gazing down the way-a short way too it was comparatively-he had
come  nothing but destruction a pulling down of ideals an overturning of
laws a mad determination to gratify desire at the expense of all else-all this
from the dawn of manhood to six short years ago

   then he had faced the other way and now was just beginning to find
fruit of quite another sort when the sowing of his old days of recklessness
confronted him

   as ye sow ye must reap he quoted to himself and for a while he
seemed not to hear the leaves moved gently by the summer breeze but in his
ears there lingered yet the crash of the thunder crying   atone  atone   

   he rose and crossed the floor to stand for an instant under a painting that
hung on the wall opposite the window it was that of a woman some thirty
five years of age with eyes like his that seemed to look down at him now as
he stood beneath them in the darkness

    ah mother he murmured softly if i had had you longer need it
have come to this what shall i do  have i not done penance enough
must i go through life denied the happiness that is given to other men because
of a moments folly a moment-yes it comes vividly before me again
the music the floating forms of dancers the fumes of the wine mounting to
my head the seductive tones of a womans voice reaching my ear the daring
the abandon of youth  was there any thought of god in it all ah no
no it was blasphemy

   he began to walk up and down the floor he stopped presently to draw
forth his watch and press the spring of the repeating bell in silvery chimes
twelve strokes rang out succeeded by a solitary one it was after midnight

   hartfield stepped to the window and looked out towards the east he
wished that he could delay the dawning of another day he felt that he
could not bear the sunlight with his mind given over to the chaos that now
reigned there

   but why must there be chaos  what if he went to grace on the morrow
and told her and her mother everything  he would abide by their decision
he must abide by it then if they felt that his atonement was not yet
the target of fate



complete lie would accept the verdict and strive to bear its burden on the
other hand should they agree with the conviction that was now coming over
his own spirit that the past was dead that he ought not to let it live by being
faithful to one of its memories then this knowledge shared among these
three would bind them closer to one another

   a sigh escaped him but it was one of relief at last it seemed as if light
had come to him at any rate one path of duty was marked out straight
before him

   he started to close the shutters before lighting his lamp the clouds had
all disappeared the stars shone down unhindered hartfield took it as an
omen of good and turned away noting not that mars glowed tonight with a
slightly deeper tinge

chapter v-the woman in the baeeroom

   the news of the ministers engagement to grace kingsbury flew through
the congregation like wildfire exactly how it got out those most deeply in-
terested could never ascertain certainly hartfield did not tell any one 
neither did grace or her mother the only supposition hartfield could form
in the matter was that old mr briggs the sexton who had seen them go
away together under the same umbrella that wednesday night had jumped
at conclusions which he took no pains to keep to himself and now that the
thing was known he was just as glad that he had not been obliged to an-
nounce it formally

   the majority of the congregation were pleased they thought it the
right thing for the pastor to be married and have some one to entertain
callers and the kingsburys though they had not lived in the town as long
as some others and had always kept a great deal to themselves were of very
good family it was understood but miss tagford was particularly acri-
monious in her discussion of the affair

   that grace was always a forward piece she declared  for all she
pretended to be so modest not wantin to stay an listen to talk that was
plenty good enough for other folks to hear she was fishin for the minister
all the time

   she went around to call on catharine batters the very day she heard the
news to be sure catharine was only a servant but she had lived in the
town a long time once next door to the tagfords caroie considered it her
christian duty not to drop her acquaintance because reverses had come to the
family it may be noted that this obligation did not rest so heavily upon her
during the days of the bemises occupancy of the parsonage

   miss tagford chose the hour for her call when she knew the minister
would be at a funeral in the next town she saw catharine at an upper
window sweeping the study miss tagford marched into the house without
the formality of knocking and went straight up stairs

   well catharine she said dropping down on the lounge and fanning
herself with a magazine she had picked up   this is strange news about mr
hartfield


the target of fate

    it is that sister tagford catharine had been brought up a methodist
you could a knocked me over with a straw out of my broom when i heard
it

   when are they going to be married do you know miss tagford
went on she believed in the principle that if there is anything rou want to
find out you should ask about it

    laws i dont know nothin about it you dont expect mr hartfield
would open his heart to me do you  why things might have gone on this
way for a month before id have known he was in love if the butchers boy
hadnt told me this morning of course i pretended i knew all about it i
wasnt goin to have the ivinses suppose i wasnt up to everything that went
on in this house

    then he dont act like an engaged man catharine  

   miss tagford was taking in everything in the room with an eager eye as
she spoke she had never before penetrated to this part of the house and
was determined to make the most of her opportunity

     not a bit but he was always a little queer you know so maybe theres
no chance for him to change any

   catharine was dusting the desk as she spoke and now looked up from her
work with a little exclamation

   i never knowed him to do this before though she said  go out
an leave his key in the drawer he always keeps this side of the desk tight
locked but he was goin to take miss grace to the funeral with him this
afternoon it must a turned his head a little after all

   you say he always keeps that side of his desk locked catharine
miss tagford had risen and come over to the center of the room her eyes
were fixed on the desk with longing desire  what do you suppose hes got
in there  she went on  something he dont want people to know about
ill be bound

   oh i guess it aint nothin much retorted catharine who whatever
other faults she may have possessed was not overburdened with curiosity

   at this moment a ring at the bell called her downstairs a gleam of
malicious pleasure come into miss tagfords eyes when she saw that she was
alone

    i think i ought to make sure about this thing she murmured  as
a member of the church its my duty to find out about it a minister
oughtnt to have aiv secrets from his people

   she made a sudden dart at the drawer and pulled it open a look of dis-
appointment overspread her face as at first glance it seemed to contain noth-
ing but sermon paper but she put her hand down to a spot where some-
thing seemed to be tucked in between two of the sheets she felt two pieces
of heavy cardboard with a fast beating heart she drew them out and found
them to be cabinet sized photographs they were the two portraits hartfield
had gazed at so earnestly at the close of his first sunday in newcomb

   miss tagford looked from one to the other with a thrill of delight at her
mischief loving heart as soon as she had recognized hartfield in one of them
she felt as if she had just unlocked bluebeards secret chamber the
the target of fate



pictures had been fastened together face inward with a rubber band she
took a good look at them and put them back before catharine returned she
did not stay long after that she felt that already she had learned far more
than she had hoped to find out when she went up to the ministers study

   who could that woman in the low cut dress be  was it possible that
mr hartfield had been married once and that this was his first wife  no
that could not be she decided for what reason would there be then for his
keeping the pictures hidden in that way  and a portrait of himself was kept
along with it evidently the woman was some one with whom he was very
closely associated

    maybe hes married now miss tagfords heart almost stopped beat-
ing as this idea flashed into her mind what if this should be so and she
should be the one to prove to mr hartfields admirers that he was a
scoundrel 

   but how could she do this  she could not very well go around and tell
people that shehad been looking among the ministers private papers and
discovered something that compromised him she could throw out hints
however and datfk ones too and with this object in mind she now turned her
steps towards mys robbins

   mrs robbins was just starting down the street to do some shopping but
miss tagford said she would walk along as she wanted to see if they would
tin over an old saucepan for her at colgates

   of course youve heard the news about the minister she began
before they had gone twenty rods together

     no what new piece of nonsense has he been up to now    rejoined mrs
robbins  is he goin to give a lecture on how to train for the circus 

    no hes engaged to be married to grace kingsbury the old maid
came out with the announcement in a burst as if fearful they might meet
some one if she waited who would rob her of the pleasure of telling it

   of all things well i wish her joy of him a nice sort of family
man hell make the slight put upon her dora still rankled in mrs
robbins mind

   well he ought to make a good one if practice goes for anything
remarked miss tagford mysteriously

     practice  what do you mean by that caroline    mrs robbins
turned a mystified countenance toward her companion

    oh ive heard a thing or two responded miss tagford with a slight
toss of the head as a matter of fact of course she had heard nothing  it
was what her prying eyes had seen on which she had based her statement

     what have you heard    persisted mrs robbins

    oh i dont want to make trouble responded the old maid  but ill
tell you mrs robbins in confidence mind i wouldnt wonder if mr
hartfield were a married man  

    caroline tagford   ejaculated the other  how did you find it out
who is she   

   i didnt find it out i tell you i dont know who it is but shes
mighty bold lookin all dressed up and her neck showin  

                                                                                            


the target of fate

      mercy sakes caroline what are you talking about  you must have
seen the woman

    miss tagford saw that she had committed an indiscretion

   hush dont say anything she retorted just wait and see what
will come of it heres colgates good bj ill see you at church
tomorrow  

   as may be readily conceived mrs robbins was greatly stirred up by the
hints dropped by miss tagford she thought about it all night and the
next morning after service sought out the old maid and tried to get some
more facts from her but miss tagford maintained a mysterious reserve and
went about with her head in the air as if she were a very exalted personage
hartfield and grace meantime were dwelling in the lovers paradise

     it seems as if you are the one i have been looking for all my life he
once told her  if you had not cared for me i do not know what i should
have done my nature is a strong one and when i love it is with all my
heart  

     i cant realize it yet sometimes was her reply  tl- t out of all the
others you should have cared for me  

     dont say that grace it argues very poor taste on mykpart to intimate
that there is anybody else who could attract me  

   it ws shortly after this episode that the event of miss tagfords life
occurred a cousin of hers who had married years before and gone east to
live wrote to her stating that her husband had secured a position as clerk at
one of the big hotels on lake george where she would be pleased to have
caroline come and make her a two weeks visit they had a cottage close by
the hotel where they took boarders but if caroline didnt mind sleeping with
matilda she was welcome to come

   of course miss tagford didnt mind she was so elated at the pros-
pect of  going a visiting  that she forgot for a time the startling discovery
she had made in the ministers study but she recalled it in every detail
when she reached her cousins and entertained her hostess by the hour
with her speculations on the matter

   depend upon it emma she would say theres something very
queer about the thing why the man got to talking about actresses on the
way home from church after his first service i sometimes think its my duty
to go to that kingsbury girl and tell her up and down that shed better make
some inquiry about the man shes engaged to before she marries him

    but you havent any proof that hes done anything wrong caroline
her cousin would retort that picture may be a photograph of his
sister  

     sister  then what does he want to keep it hid away secretly for  
she may be dead and-and he thinks of her as sort of sacred cant
you imagine how it would be caroline

    no i cant theres james cadmus im sure i thought everything
of him an i dont keep his picture tucked away out of sight

    in spite of her concern about the ministers morals miss tagford managed
to enjoy herself at lake george when the visit was over she had only one
the target of fate



thing to regret and that was that it had not been possible for her to know
beforehand the circumstance which was to befall on the last night of her
stajr it would have added such zest to everything else in the way of antici-
pation

   on this particular evening there was a hop at the hotel where emmas
husband was employed miss tagford was prevailed upon to overcome her
scruples against dancing sufficiently to accompany her cousin over to the
piazza where bartley procured chairs for them in a good location by one of
the windows

   it was a new environment for caroline tagford the dresses of the
women in the ballroom were a revelation to her

    thats the way that creature in the picture looked emma she leaned
forward to whisper

   isnt it lovely returned mrs dunham im so glad we had this
before you went home caroline

   miss tagford was not especially enchanted she had had better times
than she was having sitting out there  that draughty piazza peeping
through the slats of a shutter into a brilliantly lighted room watching a lot
of people who were evidently enjoying themselves more than she was she
was about to propose that they get up and walk around a bit when she sud-
denly clutched her cousins arm with a fierceness that made poor emma
wince

    whats the matter caroline   she exclaimed

   look look there that woman in the yellow satin with them ribbons
streamingdown her back

   yes yes what of her

    shes the creature that the minister has got the picture of shes older
lookin but im sure shes the same one

   miss tagfords hands were fairly shaking in the excess of her excitement
her throat had become so dry that she could scarcely speak

    it cant be caroline it must be somebody that looks like her

    why cant it be emma theres no law against it an id know that
woman anywhere i must speak to her  

   miss tagford rose and began pushing her chair back

   sit down caroline commanded her cousin pulling fiercely at her
shawl  you mustnt go in there you aint dressed

    aint dressed   miss tagford gave a contemptuous sniff id like to
know if i aint got more on me than them shameless creatures i tell you i
must speak to that woman its providence has brought her in my way like
this  i musnt shirk duty when its marked out plain before me

    but what are you going to say to her for mercys sake do be careful
caroline it may cost bartley his place

   emma dunham had risen too now and with both hands clasped about
her cousins arm was endeavoring to draw her back into her seat

   i tell you i must speak to her emma miss tagford insisted if
you dont want to be mixed up in it youd better stay here

   mrs dunham thinking that perhaps her cousin would not be recognized


the target of fate

as having any connection with her decided that she would act on this sug-
gestion and resumed her seat just as the other succeeded in forcing a passage
for herself between the rows of chairs that were banked up in front of every
window

   just how she was going to accomplish her purpose miss tagford had not
yet determined she went around to the office entrance of the hotel and took
up her station near the door of the ballroom she had lost the woman now
she must stand there till she could find her again she had been dancing
with an oldish man of military bearing  miss tagford resolved to keep a
lookout for him too

   at last she saw them both again they had taken their places in a
quadrille not very far away from the door miss tagford squeezed herself
close up to the hat shelf and watched them the woman was pretty  there
was no denying that she certainly looked a good deal like the photograph
she was very vivacious throwing her head back and laughing up into the
face of her partner the onlooker in the hall could not speak to her now
and stop the dance she must wait for a more fitting opportunity mean-
while she could think up what she should say

   but suddenly some one pulled her sleeve and called her name it was
bartley dunham and he wanted to know what she was doing there

    cant you see all you want to outside  he added

    yes but i wanted to speak to that woman there-see the one in yellow
dancing with the man thats got the gray mustache

   bartley thrust his arm through hers and drew her out to the piazza

   you cant speak to her now he said thats mrs westerman
do you know her   

     no westerman did you say her name was  is that her husband with
her

    no thats colonel upton but if you dont know her what under the
sun did you want to speak to her for wheres em 

   around where we were sittin tell me more about this mrs
westerman is her husband here 

   no shes a widow shes spending the summer here shes from new
york

    thats it he used to live in new york

    what do you mean caroline whos he 

    why mr hartfield our minister-the one i was telling you and emma
about mrs westerman is the very woman whose picture i found in that
drawer  

    nonsense it cant be possible you told us this was a young girl
about eighteen mrs westerman must be nearly thirty its only somebody
who looks like her  

    miss tagford began to waver a little herself now it would take agood deal
of assurance to say what she wanted to that proud looking woman by this
time they had reached mrs dunham who had not been able to keep the chair
her cousin had vacated

    but i think we had better go home now she said and with a little
the target of fate



more persuasion they got caroline to abandon her purpose of seeking an in-
terview with mrs westerman she admitted reluctantly that possibly the
woman was not the one she believed her to be

   but she had gained at least one fact she had found out the womans
name bartley told her it in full-mrs le roy westerman she put it
down on a piece of paper so that she would not forget it at any rate she
would have a great story to tell to her friends in newcomb when she got
back something might come of it after all she was glad that she was
going home the next day it seemed as if she couldnt wait to tell the news

chapter vi-thi anonymous letter

   contrary to her first intention miss tagford did not blazon abroad her
discovery at lake george as soon as she reached home in thinking it over
she came to realize the fact that it would be a little awkward for her to ex-
plain how she happened to see those photographs when they were supposed
to be put away secretly it was different telling her cousin about them
emma did not live in newcomb and it was not necessary to go into details

   but it was not in her nature to keep such a thing to herself first under
strict injunctions to secrecy she told mrs robbins about it and then a day
or two later confided the matter to mrs mason

   there i always knew there was a mystery about mr hartfield   ex-
claimed the former  i think it was a mercy caroline that you happened
to see that photograph what do you suppose we ought to do about it its
plain he must think a lot of that woman and he engaged to another one 
not that i pity that kingsbury girl so much but its sure to bring scandal
 the church in the end i wish you could have had a talk with the woman
you are sure it was the same one  

    i thought it was but emma and bartley were certain it couldnt be
id just like to see her and the minister together though

   mrs mason strongly advocated aggressive measures

   some one ought to go to mr hartfield and ask him right out to ex-
plain the thing she affirmed but as no one was willing to go as far as
this-she added shed do it herself only she wasnt a member of the church-
things seemed likely to remain just as they were till one afternoon the three
met at the bakery and mrs robbins suggested that they all adjourn to her
house and give the matter thorough discussion

   the result of this symposium was the determination to write an anony-
mous letter to mrs westerman this was mrs masons idea

    its safer to write to her than to the minister she explained she
dont know anybody here and will never suspect who its from

    but what shall we say in it   mrs robbins wanted to know she
rose as she spoke and went over to close the door so that there would be 
possibility of dora overhearing the proceedings

   why just tell her how the thing stands replied miss tagford who
seized on the idea with enthusiasm  if nothin comes of it weell know she
aint the right one and theres no harm done


the target of fate

    wholl write it was mrs robbins next question

    oh that doesnt matter there wont be any name to it so its no
odds id just as lief as anybody

   it ought to be sent right off miss tagford interposed  theres no
knowin how long shell be up at the hotel

    ill write it now if mrs robbinsll get me pen and paper mrs
mason settled her bonnet strings and looked as though she were ready for
the martyrs stake in the good cause

   writing materials were produced and then just as the task was about to
be begun a snag was struck

   how shall i start it mrs mason inquired i dont like to say
 dear mrs westerman  she must be a shameless creature from all caroline
tells us-

    you might put it  dear madame  mrs robbins suggested

    no i dont want to have any  dear  in it at all suppose i put just
 mrs westerman  at the top  mrs mason stuck the end of the penholder
in her mouth and looked at her two coadjutors

   yes thatll do returned miss tagford its plenty good enough
for her now go on and say  a friend would like to tell you- 

    but i aint her friend broke in mrs mason  an i dont want to
be

   whats the good of saying anything like that anyway interposed
mrs robbins  just go right in and tell what we want to without any lead-
ing up to it

   once more mrs mason put pen to paper but she made no mark

    lets see she said  what is it we want to tell her 

    why that the rev john hartfield a man she once knew is living in
this town and is engaged to be married if hes bound to her in any way
shell know what to do then so spoke miss tagford and mrs mason
wrote accordingly

    would you say who he was engaged to  she asked when she was half
way through

   no there isnt any good of doing that spoke up mrs robbins
shell find it out quick enough if she comes here after him

    you dont think shell do that do you  exclaimed mrs mason drop-
ping her pen and looking a little frightened

   she may responded miss tagford she secretly hoped she would
it would be a pity she felt to have all this excitement end in nothing at all

   on hearing this mrs mason was disinclined to do any more work  the
letter but all that was needed now was to address the envelope

    id do that myself said miss tagford  but bartley dunham knows
my writin suppose you do it mrs robbins 

   after some demur mrs robbins consented and then miss tagford offered
to mail it which she did on her way home this was on tuesday  when
the three met at church the following sunday they exchanged significant
glances but did not dare have much to say to one another they all paid
strict attention to the preacher striving to note if there was any change in
the target of fate



his demeanor which would indicate a shock to his nervous system but they
could pefceive none

    guess it couldnt been the same woman caroline mrs robbins whis-
pered cautiously as they met near the gate

    maybe shes gone away an they had to send the letter on after her
just wait a while

   on wednesday of this week the stage belonging to the imperial hotel
rattled back from the  train with a passenger inside mr midwin the
proprietor who was dozing on the front porch over a day old newspaper
rubbed his eyes and looked again when he beheld old black tom backing the
horses around to the stepping stone in front of the ladies entrance as a
rule nothing ever came back in the noon stage but the mail bag

   guests often went away by the train it met however it always seemed
that more guests were leaving the imperial than ever arrived at it it was
one of the standing newcomb mysteries how this could be

   mr midwin was on his feet in an instant but he nearly lost them again
in astonishment when holding the door open for his guest to descend he be-
held the lady she was dressed in black but the waist of her gown was
more like a mans jacket than mr midwin had ever seen on woman before
this parted at the breast revealing underneath the unmistakable shirt of the
gentleman topped by a stand up collar the latter encircled by a black tie
fastened in four in hand style the tailor nfade girl was as yet an
unknown quantity in newcomb mr midwiu was at first undecided whether
to bow down and worship or close the stage door and tell tom to drive back
to the station as fast as he could the sight of the glittering stones in the
womans ears reassured him this was surely a feminine trait he put out
his hand and assisted the stranger to alight

   she was a handsome woman apparently about thirty there was a cold
glitter in her eye however that mr midwin noted without being exactly
able at the time to explain just why he was affected by it as he was

   this is the imperial is it the woman took a tortoise shell lorg-
nette from its position on her girdle and held it up for an instants survey of
the building   is this the only hotel in town    she turned on mr
midwiu suddenly with the question surveying him with her glass just as she
had surveyed the building

   no oh no maam responded midwin who many of the citizens de-
clared was entirely too meek to run a hotel successfully he had inherited
the property from his father   but the imperial is the leading one  

     oh it is the leading one is it 

   the woman repeated these words as she turned again towards the house
with her glass as though she were seeking from it confirmation of the asser-
tion made by its owner she dropped the lorgnette suddenly and took a
step closer to the landlord

    come now she said in quite a different tone and with a smile that
revealed two rows of dazzlingly white teeth what will you charge me for
a parlor and bedroom for-let me see-say a week   

   mr midwin drew a quick breath he was quite overwhelmed by the


the target of fate

intimation that she might want to stay with him for a week his usual
guests were commercial travelers who rarely lingered over a couple of days

     a parlor and a bedroom on a lower floor of course would cost you
twenty dollars for the week if you will step into the parlor i will bring the
register to you  

   mr midwin had caught sight of the great saratoga trunk standing by the
drivers seat on the omnibus it seemed to convince him that there was a
reality about the weeks stay business he threw open a door on the piazza
that led directly into a small reception room and stood alongside of it in a
deferential attitude till the lady had walked past him and taken a seat inside

    uinpli she muttered glancing around her critically and drawing off
her gloves with a little toss in the air of each as she freed her fingers of it
 if hes really here it must be a come down for him jack hartfield  ha
ha  

   she laughed softly and then got up to walk around the room in a restless
fashion she paused suddenly before one of the windows

    who could have sent me that letter  she murmured  i wonder-
but there  i wont puzzle my head about it any more ill take the goods
the gods provide asking no questions ah jack i didnt know how much
i cared for jou till this opportunity of seeing you again was thus unexpect-
edly made possible i wonder if you have changed much if you have many
traces of the bonny boy of ten years ago  and a minister now ha ha
ha  

   she laughed aloud this time mr mid win coming in with the register
a bottle of ink carried carefully on top of it and a pen behind his ear was
startled almost into dropping his burden by the sound he deposited the
book and the ink quickly on the marble topped center table then proffered
the pen to the lady

    oh yes you want me to write my name of course she said

   she sat down took the pen and was about to begin with a little flourish
when she paused she raised her eyes from the page for an instant and
gazed at the ugly pattern of the wall paper reflectively the hesitation was
only for an instant however it was not noted by the landlord whose eyes
were fixed on the varied display of rings on the hand of his newly arrived
guest

     there she exclaimed and rose with a little sigh of relief

    mrs l h westerman new york read mr midwin

   the name had an aristocratic sound in spite of some odd mannerisms in
the woman who bore it he quickly decided that she was some wealthy widow
of fine family in the metropolis but what could have brought her to new-
comb  however that was no concern of his at present he must accept
the windfall of fortune and be thankful without seeking to comprehend the
various agencies that had raised the breeze creating it

      when do you have luncheon   

   mrs westerman asked this question as she picked up her chatelaine
watch and noted the time

    luncheon  mr midwin repeated the unaccustomed word in order to
the target of fate 



gain the opportunity to more thoroughly comprehend it  dinner is ready
at one   he finally replied

   oh you have supper at night then i suppose a frown creased the
womans brow for an instant  ah well she added  never mind got
many people in the house 

    not many just at present madame  mr midwin made this reply in
apologetic fashion as though wishing her to believe that the hot weather ac-
counted for the fact   shall i show you to your room   

    yes im tired i shall want to rest before dinner but no luncheon  
she followed the landlord out of the room lifting her eyebrows and shrugging
her shoulders with an air of resignation

   she made  remark  the rooms when she saw them she begged that
her trunk might be sent up at once

    if i dont feel able to come down to lun-dinner i suppose i may have
it sent up to me  she asked as the landlord was about to take his departure

    certainly madame twenty five cents extra for meals sent to rooms

    yes i understand that she replied  and have you any good claret in
the cellar i shall want a bottle your very best remember

    very good responded the landlord

   once outside the door he raised his hands above his head while he shook
the latter in silent wonderment

   she beats all i ever see he muttered  mans clothes pretty near
an bottles of wine  dear dear what will mrs midwin say when i tell
her 

    but mrs midwin was at this time visiting relatives in a distant part of the
state she was of a much more wide awake nature than her husband per-
haps if she had been at home mrs westerman might have had a few questions
put to her after she had registered

   tom had to get the assistance of sam the second man at the stable to
help him up the stairs with the saratoga trunk when they had deposited it
in the spot pointed out by its owner she said 

      i want one of you to come back here in fifteen minutes and take a letter
out for me to mail remember in fifteen minutes i dont see any bell in
the room  

    yesm answered tom and on the way down stairs he confided to
sam that he thought the newcomer must be the circassian girl from the
circus married and become respectable

    didnt you see what funny yeller hair she had  he added  kind o
whitish i never seed none like it afore outside de show  

   in fifteen minutes by the barroom clock he was back at no  in re-
sponse to his knock the door was opened to a crack and a white hand passed
out a square shaped envelope and a ten cent piece

     right away please said the voice inside

   yes maam tank ye maam

   tom pocketed the unexpected coin-for the few ladies who chanced to
stop at the imperial were non-tippers-and shambled off towards the post
office on the next block at a faster gait than usual


the target of fate

a half way to his destination curiosity prompted him to look down at the
 address on the letter

      golly he exclaimed its agoin to mr hartfield the minister she
 must be sick an tinlc shes goin to die she did look purty white for a
 fac   

     tom went on and dropped the letter in the slot at the post office as he
 turned away he saw hartfield on the other side of the street he crossed
 over and hailed him

      massa hartfield he said theres a letter for you in de offis i done
 jess drop it in you better go over an get it out fore it gets cold and
 elated at the joke he felt he had made tom hurried back to the hotel

chapter vii-the return of the past

    hartfield had been to call on mrs brink the old lady had not been
 very well  she had been absent from church on sunday she was all right
 again now however  one of her twinges of rheumatism she explained to the
 minister who enjoyed his visit with her exceedingly

    she had spoken so nicely of grace she thought the two just suited to
 each other she said and had been so pleased when she heard of the engage-
 ment hartfield was set aglow with a sense of his blessings as he came away
 and walked back toward the parsonage grace had promised to name the day
 for the wedding at some early date in october the session had offered to
 grant him leave of absence for a month he had decided they would go
 west for their trip

     he was in the upper story of his air castle when black tom accosted him
 he had not intended to stop at the post office then tetters very seldom
 came for him in the noon mail but this was evidently something from some-
 body in town perhaps there was sickness he stepped across the street and
 entered the post office

    the mason carryall stood before the door mrs mason was on the front
 seat driving two of the children and a great bundle of purchases in the rear
 gil mason was in the office getting the mail

     hartfield stopped to speak to the wagon load not omitting to shake hands
 with the children they were not particularly attractive youngsters but
 then the minister had not failed to profit by the lesson he had learned from
 his experience with mrs robbins

    yes were all pretty well mr hartfield mrs mason replied to his
 inquires  timothy is kind of dragged down with work on the place though
 gittin in all the crops gilly look in mr hartfields box and see if there is
 a letter for him

     nom there aint returned the boy after he had gone in to make an
 inspection

     why thats odd   exclaimed hartfield  i was just told there was
 something here for me excuse me mrs mason perhaps mr brown has
 misplaced it

    mrs mason glanced after him sharply as he went up the steps into the
the target of fate

i

office she did not drive on as soon as gil got in she sat there as if trying
to think what other errand she had to do before turning the horses heads
homeward then she glanced up and saw the minister coming out of the
post office holding a square envelope in front of him an expression on his
face she had never seen there before but when he noticed that the carriage
was still standing there he slipped the letter into the side pocket of his coat
and said  it is from town mr brown hadnt taken it from the basket
yet good morning mrs mason

   he lifted his hat and passed on mrs mason looked after him

    from town is it it cant be the answer then she said to herself
 but i never saw a man look as much as if he was suffering awful pain

   she slapped the lines on the horses backs and started homeward deter-
mined to mention the incident to caroline tagford the next time she saw
her hartfield meanwhile walked along the maple shaded main street toward
the parsonage but he seemed not to be really conscious of where he was
going the walking was purely mechanical fie was not sensible of bend-
ing his steps in an- particular direction he remembered speaking to mrs
mason as he came out of the post office he wondered now how he could
have done it he hoped he had not said anything out of the way he had
no recollection of what he had said

   he kept one hand over the pocket that held the letter the letter which he
had not yet opened but the writing on which he had recognized at the first
glance he had never expected to see it again so many years had elapsed
since any communication had passed between him andthe writer that he had
felt justified in hoping that never again in any way would their paths cross

     grace    the one word escaped him with a sort of shudder was it
nemesis on his track now that he had given himself up to a happiness that
he had once thought never could be his 

   but it was idle for him to be anticipating evil in this way before he knew
anything definitely perhaps after all the letter was not from her it
might be possible that some one else would write a similar hand there were
strange coincidences constantly occurring in the world he hurried on
reached the parsonage and going up to the study locked himself in then
seated at his desk he drew the letter from his pocket and slit open the en-
velope with the silver dagger that lay beside the inkstand

   an odor of violet was diffused about him as he drew out the iuclosure
the faint hope with which he had sought to buoy up his spirits faded before
that perfume as a flower wilts beneath a scorching sun for one second he
closed his eyes then squared his shoulders unfolded the letter and began to
read but when he took in the date line imperial hotel newcomb he sprang
to his feet with the note crushed together in his hand

    here in this very town   he muttered

   a black frown gathered on his brow righteous indignation chased the
sadness out of his eyes in that moment he looked ready to neet an army
then came the reaction  he sat down in the chair again and as he smoothed
out the crumpled sheet he murmured to himself  of course she is here

i ought to have known that tom told me he had himself posted the letter


the target of fate

   he took the letter up and read it through this time it was very short 
only a few lines and ran as follows

dear jack 

    i learned by accident that yon were here i could not resist coming to see you for the
sake of old times i shall expect you to come here and call upon me tonight if you do
not do so i shall feel obliged to present myself at the parsonage of the rev john hart-
field which may not perhaps be so pleasant for him affectionately	iuciiik

   once read through hartfield placed the note on the desk inlfrout of him
dropped his head on his two hands and proceeded to go over it again more
slowly with a determination to read what might be concealed behind each
sentence for he knew  lucille well in all these years he had not for-
gotten those things in which she was master

      i learned by accident that you were here  

      what accident was that    he asked himself

   had she seen his name in one of the religious papers it seemed highly
improbable that she would look there had she met some mutual friend of
the old dajs who had told her  but he knew not one of these who was
aware of his present whereabouts and occupation he must leave this still a
mystery and go on to the next sentence

      i could not resist coming to see you for the sake of old times  

   hartfield knew how much sentiment weighed with the writer there
was a settled purpose in her appearance in newcomb what was it  did
she know that he was engaged to be married to grace kingsbury 

    i shall expect you to come here and call upon me tonight

   this was a command with a threat of some sort concealed behind it he
understood this readily enough without the help of the next sentence pro-
claiming the alternative that was presented to him but the threat itself 
what would that be  what hold did she expect to have upon him 

   but there was no use in guessing at motives the question to be decided
now was as to whether or not he should go to the imperial that night

   this was prayer meeting evening and after the service lie of course ex-
pected to accompany grace home he could stop at the hotel after that
this would not be too late for  lucille

   but to see that woman again  every nerve in his body revolted from the
idea suppose he wrote to her and asked her what she wanted of him but
no  this would not answer she had determined to see him and there were
plenty of ways in which she could effect her purpose if he did not permit
her to do it in the one she had planned out it was better that he should go

   having arrived at this determination he tore the letter into small pieces
and then with a pair of scissors he clipped them into still smaller bits and
dropped them into the scrap basket the act appeared to remind him of
something he unlocked the drawer where he had placed those two photo-
graphs he had looked at the night of his arrival in newcomb

   he had not taken them out since his engagement now he gazed at them
for an instant then glanced toward the fireplace

    these should have been destroyed long ago he murmured

   taking a newspaper from the table he crumpled it into a ball threw it
into the empty fireplace dropped the pictures on top of it then drew a match
the target of fate	

from the case on the mantelpiece and struck it he was about to apply it to
the paper when with a sudden impulse he bent over and snatched up the
portrait of himself

     even in immolation we shall not be together he said grimly

   still holding the rescued picture in his hand he inserted the match in
among the creases of the paper and the next instant this had burst into
flames he watched the ends of the photograph catch the tongues of fire
and curl up as if in mortal anguish then when only cinders were left he
placed the picture he held back in the drawer turned the key on it and pro-
ceeded to pace the floor restlessly till catharine came to summon him to
lunch

   that night even grace noticed that he was evidently distraught at the
meeting he gave out the wrong hymns twice and changed a little the
order of exercises

   you are tired john arent you she said afterwards working
right through the hot weather the way you do is too great a strain on you

   he felt guilty in not telling her the truth but he had decided that he
would not worry her with the affair till it became necessary but she was a
little surprised when he declined to come in when they returned to the cot-
tage

   iam selfish though she said you ought to go home and rest
see i forbid you to change your mind now  

   she smiled up at him as she passed quickly in at the gate and shut it
between them

    he felt a burning sense of deceit as he turned away leaving her to suppose
that he had gone home for an instant he checked his quick strides almost
determined to turn around and tell her who was in the town but for the
hope that was in his heart that there might yet be a way in which she could
be spared the pain of knowing this he would have done so

   on the way to the hotel he overtook miss tagford and delia mullins
he heard them talking in suppressed tones after he had bowed and passed
them he supposed they were wondering why he had not stayed at the
kingsburys a little while it seemed to him as if he was standing on the
very edge of a crater and that the earth beneath his feet might give way at
any instant and precipitate him into the seething mass

   a number of the usual hotel loungers were tilted back on the piazza of
the imperial they appeared to be astonished when hartfield turned in at
the place instead of passing on

      good evening good evening parson   exclaimed mr midwin drop-
ping the forelegs of his chair to the floor and getting upon his own

   good evening mr midwin responded hartfield i called to-

   he came to a sudden pause the note had been signed simply  lucille
whom should he ask for  what name had she given at the hotel 

    for one second a chill struck to his soul as he thought of a certain possi-
bility then he dismissed it as not according with the purpose of the note
his pause was so brief as to be noticeable only to one who might be looking
for it


the target of fate

    a lady is staying with you he went on  she sent to me announc-
ing that she was here  

   oh yes exclaimed the landlord mrs westerman shes in no
 ill show you up myself warm weather weve been having mr
hartfield

   but we must be pretty near to the end of it now responded the
minister encouragingly

   he hoped mr midwin would not linger till after the door was opened
he could not be certain just how mrs westerman would receive him he
repeated the name under his breath that he might be sure to remember it
he would not call her anything else

    thank you mr midwiu i wont keep you any longer

   he said this quickly as the landlord halted before a room on the next floor
and started to double up his knuckles

    not at all not at all cant ever find that tom or sam when i want
em but its easier to do things yourself than to hunt em up

   mr midwin walked back toward the stairs again leaving hartfield to wish
he hadnt been so particular about sending him off that way he might think
it odd and discuss what it might mean with those fellows down stairs on the
piazza but it was too late to undo the thing now

   he knocked on the door

chapter viii-the alternative

  ah jack

   the words died on the womans lips she had started to speak them the
instant he had closed the door both her hands were outstretched the mouth
shaped into a pouting pleading position but hartfields hand was out-
stretched too its palm showing toward her who would have greeted him so
warmly there was not a shade of recognition in the eyes with which he
looked at her nothing but the courtesy a gentleman would extend to a
stranger in the tones with which he said

   you sent for me mrs westerman what is your wish  

   she stood there looking at him for a moment she was dressed quietly
for her-in black and white

    will you be seated    she said then motioning toward the sofa
hartfield laid his hand on a chair that stood near the table and then as
she sank down on the sofa herself he seated himself on the chair opposite to
her

      i told you what i wished   she said   in my note i wanted to see you
to look at you it is long since i have had that pleasure you have im-
proved amazingly

   you have some business to transact with me mrs westerman i be-
lieve what is its nature 

     did i say i had any business to transact  i cant remember every word
i write you know if i was a man and had an office i might keep a-what
do you call it-a copy press and then i could refer to what i said in my
the target of fate



notes but that aside you cant think jack how delighted i am to see you
again it is-let me see-how many years since-since we were in boston
together  

   she paused as if expecting him to answer but hartfield said nothing
he was looking at her steadily wondering what fascination this woman could
ever have exerted over him

   there was silence in the room for half a minute or so from below
through the open windows came the monotonous murmur of one voice some
member of the group on the piazza telling a story in which he the narrator
had figured heroically hartfield felt that he was making absolutely no
progress he must get mrs westerman to expose her hand

    he rose and stepped toward the door

   where are you going she exclaimed rising and coming towards
him

   i am going home he answered you said you wanted to see
me you have done that you intimate there is nothing else you want of
me

    but there is something else oh jack i want you i did not realize
what a mistake i was making when i threw you over i am free again
westerman is dead i come back to you now ask you to forget the past
and-take your wife home with you   

   she made a motion as if to throw herself into his arms he recoiled a
step or two  she sank down on the sofa her face buried in her hands

   the expression on hartfields countenance when she used that term was a
study it was rage remorse contempt and horror all combined

     you have no right to refer to yourself in that way any longer he re-
plied coldly we are nothing to each other now-can never be anything
else again  

    why not  as if encouraged by his dropping of the dignified tone
the woman now lifted her face and looked eagerly towards him   we can
be married again if you like i will give up everything that would not make
me the fit mate for such a man as you have become and-you know what a
sacrifice that would be for me

     never it can never be   he broke in  you are as dead to my heart

i tell you as if your image had never tainted it

     tainted it   she rose fire flashing into her eyes the color rushing up
into her temples   who begged of me for this defilement as you call it
now  who swore by all the powers of earth and heaven that he would ever
be true to me to the end of time do you remember nothing of that
john hartfield 

    her voice had risen till as she pronounced his name it was shrill almost
in the silence that succeeded the outburst it was noticeable that there was
significant silence also below on the porch hartfield stepped over to the
windows andclosed them then he turned and faced his companion again

    was it not you who first broke faith with me  he asked i do not
deny that i would have given worlds never to have said the words you have
just recalled to me the words themselves i do not deny but i am not the


the target of fate

man i was when i spoke them you must see that-see that it is as impos-
sible for me to have any love for you as it would be for me to take off from
my life the ten years that have passed since that unfortunate night when i
became your husband  

   she stood listening to him tapping one foot impatiently on the carpet
there was no sign of sorrow in her face now it was all auger

    do you think all this is pleasant for me to hear  she exclaimed to
have you say that the intensity with which you hate me now is as fervid as
were once your protestations of love  

   you do well to call them protestations be interjected here with a
bitter smile

    but doubtless you have loved again she went on  doubtless there
is some one in this very town who is occupying the place in your heart that
once was mine oh i can see that there is in your face i have struck the
right chord now you are not married yet  i have taken pains to find out
that much but you are rich still how much will it be worth to you to
have me go away from newcomb 

     in your true colors at last lucille rabley  

   the expression burst from hartfield almost impulsively then he drew
himself up and replied   it is worth nothing to me stay and do your
worst  

    ha ha ha  quite dramatic upon my word   she tapped her fan
upon her open palm in token of applause  you havent forgotten all you
learned in your theater going days yet it appears but i wonder if you
realize what the worst really is sir  

   she opened the fan and glanced over it at him with a menace in her
look

    i dont care what it is he replied  it can hurt me no deeper than
the consciousness that i had bargained with you for a cowardly exemption
then there is nothing in your past life of which you the rev john
hartfield are ashamed  

    plenty but not to such an extent that i would be willing to bribe you
to silence  

    then you would go home and sleep just as serenely tonight if you knew
i had taken a fancy to newcomb and had decided to settle down here for a
while  would you my dear jack  of course i would always call you
jack it would seem strange to do otherwise and i would attend your
church regularly  you cant think how anxious i am to hear you preach
and it would not take me long to become acquainted with the people
and i could tell them such interesting stories of the early life of their pastor
oh it would be a delightful summer diversion for me i declare i am quite
reconciled to the loss of whatever sum you might have given me  

   hartfield stood like a statue listening to all this he knew what it meant
in anticipation he heard about his ears the din of indignation that would be
raised but he must face it there was nothing else for him to do to
barter with a woman like this one would degrade him to the level from which
it had taken him all these years to rise
the target of fate



   but grace  she would be involved too he must think of her as well
as of himself she would be brought face to face with this woman probably
but this did not alter right and wrong if one bargain were made it might
only be the first of a never ending series

   hartfield picked up his hat from the chair on which he had placed it on
entering

      i think we have finished all business that can be transacted between
us he said turning toward the other

no not quite all she replied there is still another alternative i
will give you one which i suggested when you first came tonight take me

to be your wife again and-

    but she saw it wras useless to say more a positive expression of loathing
came into his face and in the pause that ensued he said good night
opened the door quickly and went out

    some of the ioungers on the front porch were just starting for home when
he passed them one of them a young man whom he had now and then
noticed at church steppedup to him and said half hesitatingly im goin
your way parson an if you dont mind id like to walk along with you

    it required hartfields entire stock of self control to get out a simple
 certainly he knew he must keep up must not allow the inward fire to
show itself on the exterior in this was his only salvation

    his companion began to talk about new york asking whether the minister
would recommend a young man to go there to get a start in life

     it depends on the fellows character hartfield replied if he feels
he can resist the temptations that are certain to assail him in a great city he
has certainly a wider prospect for rising if he can secure an opening than if
he remained in the country 

   while he was speaking thus he was wondering at his own self command
wondering too how long it would be before the man at his side would hear
what all the town would think of this minister who was now giving him
advice when they parted at the corner of elm street the other put out his hand
and said  i wont forget this talk mr hartfield i never had much to do
with churches or ministers till you came here i aint any too good now but
somehow you dont seem like the others you dont make religion a
womanish thing im cornin to hear you moren i have done

   when he had gone hartfield wished they could have remained in company
longer he dreaded confronting the problem of the future he recalled
what that woman had said about how his sleep would be disturbed that night

    but i have done right he argued now  there is nothing to regret
that i did not regret before-except her coming here-and that wtas an
exigency for which i should have been prepared but grace must be told in
the morning she must not hear it first from other sources

   he slept better that night than he had expected to but catharine was
concerned about the smallness of the breakfast he ate

   love cant be good for a man she told herself as she watched him
walk down the path to the gate about nine oclock

    he met grace just as she was leaving the cottage to go to market


the target of fate

    come back into the house he said  i have something i must tell
your mother and yourself at once  

    i knew you were worried last night john i saw it in your face

      can ou not guess what it is my dear   

   they had reached the sitting room and grace had called her mother in
a few words hartfield told them what had occurred feeling as though he
were inflicting a knife wound as he did so but they bore it bravely and
each approved the stand he had taken

   then they sat there and talked it over as though it were some material
calamity which was sure to fall upon them at some specified time and from
which there wras no escape

 dont fear for me john said grace  i can bear it-for your sake
it may not be for long the storm may spend itself in the first outburst
but that was the fuller horror of the thing there was only one cer-
tainty about it that it was bound to come but when the blow would fall or
how not one of them could tell

chapter ix-the orchard interview

   let us go back to the imperial hotel on that wednesday evening
when mr midwin returned to his seat on the porch after showing hartfield
to mrs westermans room one of the loungers remarked as he shifted his
body to an easier position you dont often have a call from the minister
do you midwin

    well lies been here to see me once answered the landlord  i aint
much of a hand to go to church but lavinia she likes him though she was
brought up a moravian there aint any church of that sect in this town
so she got to goin to hear hartfield an takin me with her

    your wifes away now aint she ike  remarked another of the men

      yes gone to see her folks  

    then the minister must have called to see somebody youve got stayin
in the house added the first speaker quickly

   so he did  a mrs westerman from new york she sent for him to
come

    she aint sick is she and wantin spiritual consolation   observed seth
milford

    i guess shes pretty healthy laughed the landlord in reply then in
one of those whispers which everybody is expected to listen to he put his
hand at one side of his mouth and added    she drank a pint bottle of
claret for her dinner  

    she did  ha ha and then sent for the minister

   there was a general laugh and then mr milford volunteered to relate a
story of an experience of his in the war which speaking of claret reminded
him of just why it should except that claret was the color of blood not
one of those present quite understood but then seth milford was ready
with a story on the slightest provocation and the talk was effectually
switched off from the minister and his affairs till the sudden sound of a
the target of fate



womans voice raised to shrill tones came floating down from the floor

above

    they seem to be havin high words up there midwin remarked alec
rodney  is that the lady hartfields calling on  

    it must be responded the landlord  thats where her room is
   then they heard the window put down

   kind o queer dont you think commented seth milford looking
around from one to the other of his companions ready to enlarge upon this
new topic at the first sign of encouragement from any quarter

what sort of a woman is she midwin inquired mr rodney

  young  

     well i should call her so and a stunner in dress if to fix herself up
like a man makes a thing stunning  tis kind o queer come to think a
person like her should send for the minister  

    maybe shes some kin to him suggested andrew macy the young
man who afterwards walked away with hartfield

     no that cant be rejoined milford  shed go straight to his house
if she was an you say she drank a bottle of champagne for her dinner
midwin   

     claret seth a pint bottle of claret

    well twas wine anyway thats scandalous enough for a lone woman
to be drinking an they tell me the ministers engaged  

     yes to the kingsbury girl

    queer very queer seth milford shook his head slowly from side to
side with the air of a sage

    oh i guess its all right the landlord was not anxious to have any
sort of scandal associated with his house but tongues had been set wagging
and the next day it was whispered from one to the other in the town that a
loud looking woman was staying at the imperial hotel that the minister had
called  her after prayer meeting that the two had drank a bottle of wine
between them and had then quarreled in most unseemly fashion

this was the report mrs deacon porter heard when she went to market
thursday morning and which she gave to her husband at the dinner table

     lies emmeline every one of them lies   he declared bringing his fist
heavily down  the cloth the gossips have been after that man ever
since hes been here you told em you didnt believe it didnt you

     i told em i didnt see how it could be but theres delia mullins i saw
at meeting last night dont you remember her tellin us how shed seen an
over dressed woman get into the imperial bus down at the station  

    well what if shed seen fifty women get into fifty buses does that
make it out that the minister went to see em all and got drunk  

     fie fie richard nobody says that about him

    they might as well they might as well emmeline now mind dont
you circulate that report a house further im going to investigate it myself 
 how  dont do anything rash richard

   rash  nothing can be rasher than to let scandals like this about our
minister go on worming their way like a serpent through the town  


the target of fate

     but what can you do  

     i can start another story sayin there isnt a word of truth in the whole
business cant i  

    mrs porter smiled sadly

    yes richard you can start it but it wont go twenty rods besides
youve got to have some proof

    proof i dont see as these other parties were particular about that
but i can get all the proof i want fast enough im goin down to the par-
sonage now to ask hartfield himself about the whole matter  

     oh richard youd better not do that  you might embarrass the poor
man  

     embarrass him kook here emmeline i half believe you think theres
some truth in this story bein with that tagford woman so much in the
sewin circle has depraved you

     well well i may be wrong in thinkin mr hartfield wont like your
cornin perhaps youd better go after all your own mind will be relieved
anyway  

   so when he was through his dinner the deacon put on his hat and
marched off through the hot sun to the parsonage catharine told him he
would find hartfield down in the orchard where he sometimes walked when
he was thinking out his sermons thither the deacon betook himself de-
ciding that the errand upon which he had come was of sufficient importance
to justify this interruption of sermon manufacture

    i just want to bother you for one minute parson he said as they
shook hands  no no he added as the other proposed that they go up to
the house where the deacon could be entertained more comfortably   i can
say what i want to say here as well as anywhere  

    but now that he was face to face with the minister the latters eyes look-
ing at him searchingly mr porter found the task he had set himself not such
a simple one as he had expected

     i told mrs p i was cornin straight to you about it he began rub-
bing and rubbing away at an apple he-had picked up  an i dont want
you to think mr hartfield i do this because i believe the story myself i
dont its only that i want your own words to help me nail it as the black
falsehood its sure to be

    yes i understand perfectly deacon porter

    hartfield wondered if his voice sounded as dry as it felt with all the
determination he could muster he kept his eyes fixed on the speaker who
now went on 

     i dont know whether youve heard what theyre sayin or not but its
right that you should though maybe theres some would think it queer for
me to tell you

    the deacon paused here paused for so long that hartfield felt impelled to
say 

      what is it they are telling about me   

   the deacon had evidently made up his mind to make a bold plunge and
have it over with
the target of fate

i

     why thejr say you went around to the imperial hotel last night after
meetin to see some woman thats come there an that you an she drank a
lot of wine together an then got to quarrelin i said at once there wasnt
a word of truth in it how do you suppose the story ever got  its legs
mr hartfield   

      probably because i did go to make a call at the hotel last night  

   the minister made this reply in a steady voice but it cost him an effort
not to flinch under the startled look that appeared on the deacons face

    you was therethen  exclaimed the old man  well i suppose thats
what gave ground for the story   he added after an instant  but of course
it was just a call in the line of your duty you didnt drink any wine  

    no i didnt drink any wine

   plartfield forced himself to smile as he made this response

     i suppose this woman was took sick at the hotel and sent for you    the
deacon went 

   no she wasnt ill but she sent for me she was-some one i had
known before i came here

    oh yes a friend of yours perfectly natural that you should go to see
her that just shows how they make up these stories out of nothing at all
of course there wasnt any high words between you youll excuse me
askin this parson but you see ive undertaken to clear this thing up you
parted the best of friends  	-

    i cant say yes to that deacon porter

   hartfield put out his arm and laid his hand against the apple tree under
which they were standing his fingers seemed to be making an effort to
encircle the trunk the deacon did not try to conceal the amazement this
answer caused him he dropped the apple he had been holding and
exclaimed 

    then you did have some words 

    i wouldnt describe it in just that way the lady and i failed to agree
on a certain matter that was all

   deacon porter began to look excessively uncomfortable he shifted from
one foot to the other and finally stooped over to pick up the apple he had
dropped when he had straightened up again he remarked 

      and this lady you say is a friend of yours   

     i said she was some one whom i used to know  

    well mr plartfield i wont keep you any longer im much obliged
for what you have told me good afternoon  

   the deacon turned away and began threading his course among the trees
back to the kitchen garden and so out to the path that skirted the house and
led to the front gate hartfield stood and watched him till he disappeared
from view

    he forgot to shake hands he mused  he acted almost as if i had
struck him i wonder if i should have told him all but they will know
soon enough at this rate they will all know

   the deacon meanwhile was walking back home as if in a daze

    he went there to see this woman he was saying to himself  and they


the target of fate

quarreled an he wont say she was a friend of his but just somebody he
used to know

   when he reached his own gate he observed carefully the front of the
house to note if his wife was at any of the windows he did not feel that
he could go to her just yet with his report he wanted more time to think
it over but there was a letter in the dining room he wanted to post on his
way to the store he went in quietly to get it from the mantelpiece

     well richard did you see the minister 

    mrs porter suddenly opened the other door and came in from the kitchen
the deacon started

    yes i saw him emmeline he replied  nothin you want me to
bring up from down street tonight is there   

    he had slipped the letter in his coat pocket and turned to go out again

   no im going down myself when it gets cooler but what did mr
hartfield say  

    mrs porter was putting the silver back on the sideboard but she placed
each article down carefully that she might not lose anything of her husbands
answer the deacon took off his glasses wiped them and then while he
blew gently on each eyepiece and then held it up against the light prepara-
tory to giving it another polish sat down on a chair next the door

     emmeline he said slowly  mr hartfield was at the hotel last night
and did have some words with that woman

     he told you that himself richard 

    yes he told me himself but there wasnt any wine drinking that
part wasnt true

      and the woman  who was she   

    mrs porter sank into a chair on the other side of the room

    some one he used to know thats all he told me

   well it may be all right richard you know often things come up
that you cant explain to other folks and a minister has as much right to
have his private affairs as the rest of us  

     no he aint emmeline not just like the rest of us in a case o this
kind hes a man set up for our example an i dont mind sayin to you-
mind to you onty emmeline -the deacon lowered his voice impressively-
that i was terribly cast down when mr hartfield didnt deny that there
had been words between him an that woman

     but there might have been a good reason for his quarrelin richard
the positions of this husband and wife were reversed it was now the woman
who was standing up for the pastor

    then why didnt he give it to me emmeline then why didnt he give
it to me  

    the deacon rose as he spoke and without another word left the house

chapter x-the whole story

   miss tagford was all aglow with excitement the report about hart-
fields call at the hotel had reached her ears and she felt at once that the
the target of fate



anonymous letter had borne its fruit but she dared not say much she only
went about more than usual and picked up gossip wherever she could get it
then she made it in her way to pass the imperial hotel every time she went
down the street but not once did she obtain a glimpse of the woman she
hoped to see

   on sunday however she had her great day the service had begun and
they had reached the second hymn when sexton briggs came up the aisle
and showed a woman into a seat two pews in front of the spinster the latter
obtained only a side glimpse of her face but this was sufficient to tell her
that it was the woman she had seen at take george

   miss tagford glanced quickly at the minister but his face showed no
change his sermon that morning was one of the strongest he had ever
preached the woman who had come in late kept her eyes fixed on him
steadily she was sitting with the brinks and when the congregation was
dismissed she turned to mrs brink and thanked her for the use of the pew
miss tagford inventing an excuse to speak to the elder hurried forward in
time to hear this

    i hope you enjoyed the service rejoined mrs brink giving one hand
to miss tagford as she spoke

    oh i did very much said mrs westerman effusively you see i
used to know mr hartfield and so i was very anxious to hear him preach 

    you used to know mr hartfield   exclaimed mrs brink who had not
for a moment connected the woman before her with the one about whom the
reports were circulated  then of course you must want to speak to him
he will be so glad to see you there he is coming this way with my hus-
band now

    miss tagford could scarcely contain herself for the excitement that pos-
sessed her exactly what she expected to take place she really could not
have told but she knew she was greatly disappointed when mr hartfield
suddenly left elder brink and went over to the other side of the church to
join miss kingsbury and her mother two or three of the ladies came up at
this moment to talk with mrs brink and they all began to move down the
aisle toward the door and miss tagford contrived it that she should be
next to the stranger

     do rou live in newcomb   she began

     oh no im just staying here for a few days at the hotel

     you were at lake george werent you   went on miss tagford with
the little air of importance she always assumed when mentioning her sum-
mer trip  i think i saw you there when i was visiting my cousin

   mrs westerman turned a quick look on her

    i do not remember you she said  yes i was there

   she spoke in an indifferent tone and was glancing behind miss tagfords
back across the church toward the other aisle down which hartfield was
passing with the kingsburys suddenly she turned to her companion again
and asked 

      is that the young lady to whom mr hartfield is engaged   

   yes thats miss kingsbury responded miss tagford eagerly


the target of fate

    how long have they been engaged    was the next question

     about a month i expect theyll be married before long

      has she got money   

     oh no but hes rich i guess you ought to know about that though
i thought i heard you telling mis brink that jou used to be acquainted with
mr hartfield

    yes i used to be acquainted with him and he had money too his
family were rich

   his family we dont know anything about them he never told us
much he aint been here long

   by this time they had reached the vestibule which presented a very
sociable scene with much hand shaking and a general exchange of  good
mornings   mrs robbins came up behind miss tagford and pulled her by the
sleeve in the instant that the spinster turned to see who wanted her mrs
westerman made her way out through the crowd and raising her conspicuous
black and white parasol strolled slowly off in the direction of the hotel

    there she is thats the woman he went to see at the imperial was
whispered about and for an instant or two a silence fell  the vestibule

   then the talk was resumed but in a lowered tone mr hartfield was
passing out with the kingsburys he bowed and spoke in a pleasant way to
those about him but there was a difference in their manner of greeting him
he could not but perceive that

    mrs robbins meanwhile was eagerly whispering with miss tagford

    was that the woman  a bold looking creature i must say do you
really think that letter brought her here  

     of course it did she used to know the minister real well she told
me so 

     what do you suppose there is between them  

     i cant quite make out yet but he didnt seem to want to speak to her
just now in church

     well i think a committee ought to be appointed to wait on the minis-
ter and make him explain its scandalous to have things going  this
way

   what way delia mullins came up at this minute and wanted to
know

     why the mystery there is about mr hartfield an that woman whos
stayin at the hotel miss tagford made haste to answer  taint possible
you aint heard about it delia 

     oh ive heard some whispering but i havent placed any dependence
 it 

    you havent why what can you be thinking of delia mullins
do you mean to say jou believe its right for a man thats a minister and an
engaged one at that to go to a hotel late at night and drink wine and quarrel
with a strange woman  

     i dont believe he did it replied miss mullins firmly

     of course he did it persisted mrs robbins  the whole town knows
about it go to the hotel and ask mr midwin hell tell you
the target of fate



    are you talking about the minister said mrs mason joining herself
to the group  i must tell you what i saw wednesday morning

   what you saw mis mason miss tagford broke in almost breath-
lessly  what was it  anythin to do with that woman  

    i should say it was   mrs mason smiled grimly as she spoke   i
was waiting in the carryall in front of the post office when he got a letter an
im sure it was from her by the way he looked

    a letter from her   exclaimed the three listeners in chorus

    yes and you ought to have seen his face when he got it i dont feel
s if i could sit under his preaching any more till the mysterys cleared up
but theres timothy waiting with the wagon i must be going

   miss tagford walked off with the robbinses mr robbins was a taciturn
man but he had heard the gossip about the ministers call at the hotel and
now when he found out that miss tagford had walked down the aisle with
the woman who was staying there he asked for some particulars about her

    is she any relation of hartfields  he inquired

   thats what we dont know responded his wife adding i think
you george as a member of the board of trustees ought to see that some-
thing is done about the matter what does deacon porter say  

   mr robbins and mr porter were in business together

    why i never asked him about it i never thought to do it ill
speak to him tomorrow

   the next evening as soon as her husband reached home  well george
did you speak to deacon porter about the minister   mrs robbins asked

    yes the first thing this morning

    well and what does he say  

    he thinks wed better appoint a committee to wait on hartfield and ask
him to explain things

    there what did i tell jou the very thing i suggested myself well
whos going to do it you know somebodys got to make the first move in
a thing of this kind  

    the deacons going to do it himself it seems he went to see hartfield
as soon as he heard the reports and he wasnt quite satisfied with what he
found out the minister denied the wine drinking but he admitted he went
to the hotel and had some words with the woman  

    well i hope the committeell find out who she is and all about her
said mrs robbins   when are they going to call on him  

    tomorrow night

    but hell be at the kingsburys hes there every evening when there
isnt any meeting

   but the deacon is going to send him word that we are coming its
bad business the whole of it i wish there was some other way out of it   
 there isnt this thing has got to be cleared up for the credit of the
church only saturday mrs penterby said to me shed heard of some strange
goings on of our minister but i should think that kingsbury girl would feel
the worst about it remember george you are to tell me every word that
is said at that meeting tomorrow night

    mr robbins did not promise to do this and when he set out for the par-
sonage the following evening his wife impressed the matter on his mind
again

      i wish you could go in my place clara   he said

     i wish i could she retorted promptly

   but the committee which assembled at deacon porters house and from
there adjourned in a body to the parsonage was composed only of the more
prominent male members of the congregation there were elder brink mr
colgate mr ranger mr robbins and the deacon

   they looked as solemn as though starting for a funeral all except mr
colgate who had a grim expression about his lips as if the mission on which
he wtas bound was not entirely uncongenial to his taste

     youre sure hell be there deacon   he remarked as they walked down
main street

    i sent him word yesterday afternoon that we were coming

     yes i know but did you intimate to him the nature of our business 

     i think he cant do anything but understand that i said we were com-
ing to inquire into a certain matter

   precisely and therefore he might think it a good time to be out i
think it would have been better if we could have contrived to surprise him in
some way

   i have np fear but well find him mr colgate and at this moment
they reached the parsonage

   catharine showed them into the seldom lighted parlor mr hartfield
appeared just as they were taking seats he gave each one a cordial welcome
but he was somewhat paler than usual

    for a few minutes they talked on indifferent topics but rather lamely and
with a frequent tendency to pauses one of these was broken by elder brink
who was sitting next the minister

     mr hartfield he began speaking so softly that mr colgate edged his
chair along the floor a few feet nearer  i dont know whether you sense the
reason weve all come here tonight but im inclined to think you do you
must have heard some of the talk in town about you and-and the woman
who came last week to stay at mr midwins hotel taint a pleasant sub-
ject to speak about but because people are speakin about it an because we
want to stop em doing it weve come here tonight to ask you a few ques-
tions

   the old mans tones were very tender and the eyes with which he looked
at the minister were kindly ones hartfield glanced around the circle noted
the eager bending forward of each head to catch his reply and then said

  what have you heard about me and the woman at the hotel  i should like to
have you state the particulars before i undertake to reply to them i know
about the wine drinking and the quarrel is there anything else you have
heard   

   once more he gazed from one to another composing the group around
him for an instant no one spoke then mr ranger looking very uncom-
fortable cleared his throat and said
the target of fate



    i have heard something besides that

   everjbody turned and looked at him whatever he had heard it was
plain he had not told it to the other members of the committee

    well what was it ranger speak out you know thats what we are
here for

   this from mr colgate who was evidently on the qui vive of expectancy
hartfield said nothing his eyes were fixed steadily on the sunday school
superintendent

      i dont know as i ought to tell this   went on mr ranger   because i
didnt get it direct i heard it from a man who was in my office today and
he got it from seth milford who says mr midwin told him

   once more mr ranger paused mr colgate shuffled his feet on the floor
impatiently and was about to speak when elder brink remarked    well
hiram tell us what it was remember you are saying nothing behind the
ministers back he is right here to tell us if it aint so

    well then i heard that that woman said she was mr hartfields
wife

   all eyes were immediately removed from the superintendents face and
fastened on the ministers his were not dropped but the fingers of one
hand that rested on his knee were twitching slightly  very small beads of
perspiration were gathering on his forehead elder brink turned slowly
toward him

   mr hartfield he said  youve heard what mr ranger tells us

   yes mr brink i have heard you expect me to deny it i suppose
i am not that womans husband now

   it is not so easy to describe a sensation the air appears to be surcharged
with a quality which defies capture and analysis so it was in the parsonage
parlor the members of the committee looked at one another helplessly as
it seemed and without speaking even those of them who expected the
worst were amazed elder brink although he was evidently more deeply
touched than any of them was the first to recover himself

    what do you mean mr hartfield he asked  by your not bein that
womans husband now she aint died since this morning has she 

    not that i have heard of answered the minister  i have not been
her husband since ten years ago when we were divorced

    divorced   deacon porter and mr colgate spoke in a breath

    and you are about to marry again mr hartfield   elder brink spoke
sternly for him

    yes i am about to marry again

     does-does miss kingsbury know about this    asked deacon porter

      she does    replied hartfield

   he was surprised at his own calmness but in his heart there was a feeling
of relief that the worst was over

    but do you believe in the scriptural sanction of your course mr
hartfield mr colgate inquired

    if you like answered the minister  i will tell you the whole story
indeed i think it is due to myself that i do tell it to you


the target of fate

   yes mr hartfield said the elder  i think you had better tell us
everything

   the group settled themselves iu fresh positions hartfield rose passed
into the dining room adjoining poured himself out a glass of water moistened
his lips with it and then returned to his seat

   i was the only child he began speaking in a low but very distinct
tone   my mother died when i was five years old my father then con-
centrated all his hopes on his son he was very successful in his business
and money being plentiful i had only to ask to have all my desires gratified
as i grew to manhood the length of my purse strings drew to me as my com-
panions those who had not the best influence over me it was not long before
my pace became as rapid as theirs i started to go to college at columbia
but my father deeming the influence of metropolitan life not the best for me
removed me to harvard i was fond of study although i still kept up some-
of my excesses and having a strong constitution managed to keep pretty
well up in my class in spite of my late hours

     it was in my second year that i met lucille rabley one night in boston
she exerted over me a fascination which i could not shake off indeed i did
not try to do so in those days everything was done on impulse besides i
was not accustomed to thinking that anything i wanted could be denied me
after a very short acquaintance we were secretly married only two of my
fellow students knowing of the affair i did not want to leave college before
my graduation so i stayed on till the end of the term somehow the matter
came to my fathers ears he was very angry and after the talk he had
with me i realized what i had done already i had begun to suspect that
the woman had made a dupe of me anxious only for the money i would bring
her as soon as commencement was over my father sent me off to texas
where he had a large ranch meantime the woman made overtures regarding
a divorce which my father managed for me paying over to her a sum of
money the exact amount of which i never ascertained she at once married
another man with whom my father learned that she was already on terms of
intimacy that justified a divorce

   hartfield paused for an instant the men about him were gazing at him
with a kind of dazed expression on their faces seeming scarcely to breathe
he drew a deep breath himself and went on

      i was only twenty two but i felt as if i had lived twice that many years

i loathed myself for what i had been yet knew no way out for three years
i was a cowboy the wild outdoor life built me up in health but i was
still restless in mind a man without a purpose then came a letter from my
mothers only brother a minister proposing that i go to europe with him
after some consideration i decided to accept and together we rambled all
over the continent and visited the holy land constant companionship
with a man like my uncle gradually wrought a change in me a change which
resulted in my eventually studying for the ministry and becoming your
pastor

      that woman lucille rabley i never saw from the day i parted from her
in boston till wednesday night when i went to call upon her at the hotel in
                                                                     

the target of fate



response to a note she sent me how she learned i was in newcomb i do
not know why she came here i will now tell you

   there was a stir of expectancy among the members of the committee
mr colgate was leaning far forward his mouth and eyes wide open mr
hartfield continued 

     she thought that because i had become a minister i would be willing to
bribe her to silence regarding my past she discovered her mistake that
is why the report got out that we quarreled at the hotel need i add that
she is nothing to me now there is my story gentlemen

    during this narration the expressions on the faces of the ministers hear-
ers was a study nothing but sadness was to be seen in the countenance of
elder brink deep seated horror was depicted on the features of deacon
porter mr robbins looked incredulous hiram ranger perplexed and mr
colgate a trifle triumphant the latter was the first to break the silence that
fell on the room when mr hartfield paused

   i guess youve forgotten mr hartfield he said that youre an
ordained minister

   hartfield turned a steady look on newcombs leading merchant but made
no reply mr colgate feeling that this silence on the part of the enemy
was a shame rather than a glory to himself the champion of the church
continued 

     what do you suppose will be said about your being a divorced man 
what sort of effect do you suppose it will have on the welfare of the
church  

    its mighty serious business parson mighty serious put in deacon
porter shaking his head solemnly from side to side	

    do you think gentlemen replied hartfield  that my work here has
been hindered because i did not continue to live with that woman i married
when a college boy  do you think i ought to have stayed out of the minis-
try because i was a divorced man   

    you oughtnt to have come to newcomb without letting us know about
it said mr colgate

     but suppose we leave that out of the question mr hartfield inter-
posed mr ranger  do you think it right for a divorced man to marry again
while his first wife is still alive   

   under certain circumstances i do think so answered the minister
 or i would not contemplate it  

   it aint right parson here broke in the deacon it aint right
divorce or no divorce  for this cause shall a man leave his father and
mother says the good book and shall be joined unto his wife and they
two shall be one flesh theres no gettin around that mr brink is
there 

    for reply the elder reverently closed his eyes for an instant and repeated 
 what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder

      there    exclaimed mr colgate springing to his feet and beginning to
walk up and down the floor  what do you want more than that
parson there is scripture on it

      d


the target of fate

    along toward the latter part of matthew interjected elder brink

    yes sir chapter and verse we can give you parson went on the mer-
chant coming to a halt in front of the minister  how are you going to
get over that   

    does it seem as if god had joined me in marriage with this woman 
as the minister made this reply he looked not at mr colgate but at mr
brink he spoke very softly too in a tone he sometimes used with great
effectiveness in his sermons   i was but little more than a boy  i thought
nothing of the future did not realize the responsibility i was taking upon
myself and she she was cool and calculating triumphing in the fact
that she had entrapped a young fool whose money would support her to be
sure it was a clergyman who performed the ceremony but he knew nothing
of either of us i sometimes think he was more to blame than i he was
an old man and must have thought the union a strange one yet he never
asked questions except such as we were well prepared to answer he seemed
to think that the fact that we had witnesses was sufficient and such mar-
riages are taking place in our country every day  

   seems to me mr hartfield broke in mr colgate who had now re-
sumed his seat and was wiping the perspiration from his forehead   seems to
me youre wandering from the subject

     pardon me i was merely endeavoring to point out that to my mind
that marriage was not really sanctioned by the divine blessing  

    you are certain it was a regular minister who married you are you mr
hartfield    inquired mr robbins

    yes i knew him by reputation well

   you dont seem to properly feel the wickedness of the thing you are
about to do parson the deacon came out with this in a burst as if he
had been endeavoring to keep in but could stand it no longer  no matter
if you were divorced fifty times over you haint got any right to marry again
so long as that first wife is a livin

   then you think deacon porter replied the minister that i ought
to have remained the husband of a woman like lucille rabley or that
having been separated from her and having conceived a regard for another
pure as the stars in heaven i should stifle this because i was once bound to
one who could only degrade me   

    but that one was your own free choice parson replied the deacon
leaning forward and putting his finger tips together to rock them gently back
and forth   as ye sow ye shall reap   

   and the whirlwind parson broke in mr colgate you will reap
the whirlwind think what a scandal this second marriage will bring on the
church not here only but all over the country yes sir all over the
country in his increasing excitement mr colgate brought his clinched
fist heavily down upon his knee  the newspapers will carry it to the ends
of the earth  another minister gone wrong  will be the flaring headline
and right here in newcomb too have you thought of all this mr hart-
field  have you thought of the example you will set to the young men of
your congregation  
the target of fate

i

   yes mr hartfield interposed the sunday school superintendent it
would shock people dreadfully it would be bad enough if you werent a
minister  

     mr ranger replied hartfield  suppose you put yourself in my place
for an instant take it that you made a foolish marriage as i did when you
were very young  were legally separated from the woman as i have been 
then after many years you met another woman who loved you and whom you
loved which do you think would be the proper course for you to pursue 
to keep that love locked up in your breast knowing it was there and allowing
the suppression of it to embitter all your after life as well as that of another 
or to go to that other tell her all the circumstances and allow her to decide
and then abide by her decision   

     it would be hard parson i admit to do the first replied mr ranger
but it would be opening a dangerous gate to do the other

it would break into the sanctity of our homes added the deacon
 whats marriage good for if it aint to make a man stick to the one wife  
 it would split the church parson if you were to do this thing ex-
claimed mr colgate  oh no it wouldnt he added quickly correcting
himself  there wouldnt be enough people left in it to split

    elder brink rose and looked around for his hat

   weve done our duty mr hartfield he said an its gettin late
there aint no need for me to say id given all ive got in this world that this
thing shouldnt have come up ive stood by you from the first parson i
liked you when i first saw you but i cant stand by you in this my wife
she cant stand by you and she set great store by you i tell you my
prayer is and hers will be too that youll see things in a different light by
morning

      one moment mr brink  

    hartfield had risen too but he now waved the others back to their seats
 do i understand that you wish me to tell the lady to whom i am engaged
that i cannot marry her   

    you oughtnt to marry her retorted mr colgate  how you get out
of it is no concern of ours  

    hartfields eyes flashed but he kept his voice to its even tones as he went

on

    do you think i shall be a worse man mr brink for marrying again 
will my usefulness as your pastor be impaired suppose this woman this
lucille rabley had not come here do you imagine that my second marriage
would have scandalized you by its results on my life   

     if we didnt know anythin about your having a first wife of course we
couldnt find fault replied mr brink

     precisely then do you think that because the fact of my divorce
chances to be made public i ought to be cowardly enough to go back on my
word   

    but you oughtnt to have given that word said the deacon  you
hadnt no right to say anything to miss kingsbury about marryin till you
was sure this rabley woman was dead


the target of fate

   a frown creased the ministers brow for an instant as miss kingsburys
name was mentioned

    that deacon porter is a matter for my private determination i am
quite willing to be criticised in my official capacity as your pastor what i
do as a private citizen is a matter between me and my conscience when a
man becomes a clergyman he certainly does not give up the right to judge
for himself i have long since come to a decision in this matter to alter
that decision now because certain facts have come to light would it strikes
me be contemptible i hope i have made myself understood

    you couldnt have told us any plainer to mind our own business blus-
tered mr colgate  but well see sir well see

   he started toward the door and the rest followed him but elder
brink lingered an instant to put his hand on hartfields shoulder and look
into his face with a slow silent shake of the head then he too went out
and the next instant the door had shut the minister in alone

chapter xi-the outcome or it ale

   if the news of mr hartfields engagement had flown through the town
with the speed of electricity the tidings of his divorce spread with a celerity
that defies comparison miss tagford made all haste to call upon her friend
mrs robbins

    i declare the spinster remarked after they had talked it over  i feel
most like one o the great reformers

    hush   mrs robbins cautioned her  i shant breathe easy till that
woman leaves the town

    i hear tell theyre goin to make her go a committee was made up an
went to see mr midwin about it but i must get home an write to emma
if it hadnt been for her askin me up to see her all this might never have
been brought to light

   at this same time hartfield was at the kingsburys

    john said grace  do you know i sometimes feel as if i was glad this
thing has come out we need never feel that there is anything hid now
and john

   grace paused the color surged up into her cheeks

    yes grace what is it 

    i have been thinking she went on speaking very slowly  that per-
haps if we were not to wait till next month-if we were to be married here
in newcomb it would keep anybody from saying that we would have it done
somewhere where they didnt know

    my dear the very wish that was in my own heart mr kenwood will
marry us i am sure  

paul kenwood was the baptist minister he was a few years older than
hartfield and had been his firm friend from the first moment of their ac-
quaintance already since the recent disclosures he had called at the par-
sonage and now hartfield had no hesitation in going to him with his request
 yes i will marry you hartfield he said  as i told you the other
the target of fate



day you seem to me to be acting in this matter from a strong personal con-
viction of right and wrong  

   the ceremony took place in mrs kingsburys parlor on the monday
night following the visit of the committee to the parsonage there wtere
present only the contracting parties mr kenwood mrs kingsbury and a
nephew of hers ralph chester who had come on from pittsburgh but no
effort was made to keep the matter secret and when it became known a per-
fect storm of indignation swept through the town poor mr kenwood was
caught in the full fury of the blast his church sent a committee to wait on
him with a request for his resignation and thus it came about that that
autumn newcomb lost two of her clergymen but hartfield saw that ken-
wood did not suffer because of a service to him his wedding fee was a check
of such generous size that it quite amazed the poor pastor who had been
scarcely able to make both ends meet on his meager salary he did not want
to take it but hartfield insisted and promised moreover to keep his friend in
sight for the future

    the last service at which the deposed presbyterian clergyman was to pre-
side was the wednesday night meeting following the marriage he came to
the lecture room accompanied by his wife the place was crowded and a
breathless silence reigned after the final hymn had been sung then mr
hartfield stepped to the- edge of the platform resting his hand on the table
by his side

    for the last time he began  i now address you my people as your
pastor my resignation requested by your committee has been handed in
to take effect after tonight that i part from you with regret i need not say
the work here has been very near my heart the workers have been dear to
me in the dark clouds that overhang this separation there is this ray of light

i	am not to go because you are dissatisfied with my work and now it only
remains for me to say farewell and to add that wherever i may be i shall always
remember gratefully the good will the kindly fellowship the helpful co-
operation i received from so many of you during this my first pastorate  
there were many wet eyes among the auditors at the close of this brief
address and after the benediction had been pronounced several made their
way forward to shake hands silently with the man whose course as a minister
they could not countenance among them were mrs brink mrs porter
delia mullins and gil mason

     i dont know what we boys will do without you mr hartfield he said

 you have done more for us than any-

   gilbert his mother called to him at that instant i am waiting for
you

   with a hast good by the boy turned away hartfield joined his wife
and left the place forever

	      

   in the brilliant may sunshine an aged couple stood in front of a large
church situated in one of the leading cities of the west they wrere gazing
at the notices of services affixed to the stone work

     john hartfield pastor read out the man


the target of fate

     it must be the same one myra he added turning to his wife  john
and a minister and all

   lets go in a minute seth she said the church doors are open
they turned to the entrance and reached it just as a young woman did so
coming from the other direction

     is the church kept open all the time  asked the man as the three went
in together

   oh yes the stranger replied  it has been ever since mr hartfield
came he says he wants the people to feel that they can always have a quiet
place to go for meditation

    has he a large congregation    inquired the woman who was a stranger
they were lingering in the vestibule before going inside

    yes very large and we all like him so much he does more good the
newspapers say than any pastor in the city you see there are all kinds in
the church plenty of rich people and lots of poor ones im one of the poor
ones added the speaker with a smile  but i feel that mr hartfield thinks
just as much of me as he does of the rest were only afraid we cant keep
him theres a church down in chicago wants him badly

   the young woman opened the inner door as she spoke the last words and
in silence the three entered the great auditorium there were a number of
people sitting in the pews some with their heads bent forward in the attitude
of prayer others looking steadfastly at the large stained glass window
above the pulpit representing the return of the prodigal mr and mrs
brink sat down near the rear and gazed at this with the sunshine bring-
ing out iii strong colors all the details of the picture then they noticed
the reverent demeanor of those about them who had turned in here
for a few minutes to think quietly about themselves and there was
 sound in all the place only the twittering of some nest building
robins that came in through an open window and the hushed murmur of the
citys traffic which only made the stillness inside the more impressive

     i dont know myra remarked the man when they reached the street
i dont know about it but i sometimes think we were too hard on him
that we hadnt ought to have sent him away

     its all a mystery seth returned his wife in a low tone the sanctity
of the place they had left seemingly to be still upon her   its all a mystery
an you know theres that verse  judgenot  

    and then the two walked on silently for a while

                                              george king whitmore

in jeopardy from diamonds

a tale of kimberley and the i d bs-the fearful peril of a bridegroom on his wedding
trip-why three persons wish never again to see the
most precious of gems

tyne van veys sent to south africa by his father-a worthy burgo-

master of rotterdam-to make his fortune as the initial step thereto and
soon as possible after his arrival in the orange eree state married minna van
moop daughter of a wealthy boer resident in bloemfontein their wedding
breakfast was protracted intermittently through almost a week for it is not
in boer nature to abbreviate a good thing then a day was spent in delib-
erate preparation for their contemplated bridal tour a great journey to the
town of kimberley where the diamond mines are full thirty miles away

   distance is not a mere matter of linear measurement so much as of circum-
stances thirty miles when one may traverse them within the hour in a
comfortable railway carriage are very little but thirty miles when one
travels them in a wagon drawn by mules-or worse yet oxen-under the
fierce sun and in the choking dust of south africa seem interminable this
dust is so thick and omnipresent that it is quite correct to speak of going
 through  the country and of course one sees very little of his surround-
ings

   in kimberley the air was a little clearer sufficiently so at least to permit
the tourists to realize what a strange new world they had entered as different
as possible in every way from peaceful quiet and pretty bloemfontein the
transvaal hotel where styne and minna lodged though one of the most im-
portant buildings had adobe walls for its offices and sitting rooms in front
while the bedrooms in the rear were of galvanized sheet iron and the huts
of the natives seemed to be made of flattened out provision tins nailed or tied
to slender sticks and with their gaudy labels still adorning them from the
popularity of that building material the place obtained its familiar name of
 tin town these were the conditions in kimberley at the time of which
we write

   styne made haste to free himself from the large portion of the orange
free state he had brought along and leaving minna in their room to a more
deliberate and careful toilet he went out to the hotel office by the time she
joined him he was already upon intimately friendly terms with a very ingra-
tiating stranger a wiry sharp featured man whose nasal drawl and pointed
goatee were decidedly un-english

    no siree he replied to stynes question  no britisher about me
im a clear strain ftill fledged and dyed in the wool yankee from paw-
tucket rhode island and my names elnathan perkins

the young hollander-who spoke english well having learned it in


in jeopardy from diamonds

school-was delighted with the mans shrewd observations practical knowl-
edge independence and dry humor he had long wanted to meet a real live
yankee and now that his wish was realized was not disappointed in the
character his reading had caused him to expect when minna appeared he
introduced her to his new acquaintance and cordially invited him to accom-
pany them for a stroll through the town

    certainly with pleasure assented mr perkins  and i guess i can
show you around if anybody can ive been here long enough to know this
place inside and out as well as i do my old jack knife its a good deal
overrated the word  diamonds  paints it very gay in most folks minds and
some seem to sort of hold their breath with awe when they speak of the dia-
mond mines englishmen are mostly affected that way i guess well the
mines do amount to something but not so much when jou come to comjare
their output with the sort of figures the united states is accustomed to juggle
the whole yield of the diamond mines last year was oxdy  carats
estimated worth about  or to put it in plain common sense figures
ii- and it was a pretty good year for the diamond crop but
what does that amount to alongside of the american pork mines in the same
time  why if these diamond mines were in the united states our politicians
would call them  an infant industry   

    at this instant in the dust at his feet stynes eye caught the flash of a
diamond and uttering an exclamation of exultation he made a clutch at the
prize but before his fingers reached it his hand was knocked aside by a
prompt kick of the americans foot that almost broke his wrist

   what did you do that for  what do you mean styne demanded
angrily the sharp momentary pain and resentment had not prevented his
making a second attempt to get the stone with the other hand only to find
that active foot planted firmly on it

    thats all right take it easy and come along replied mr perkins
coolly  it isnt your diamond and youd better let it alone

    why is it not mine at least until its owner is found it is lost i
might get a great reward for picking it up  

   yes you would not of the sort you expect though it isnt lost
any more than you are so long as you let it alone keen eyes are watching
it every minute and if you picked it up the reward youd most likely get
would be fifteen years-at hard labor as an  i d b  

    fifteen years  hard labor   i d b   what does that mean 

      illicit diamond buyer  

   the gentleman tells you truly interposed minna who had not lived
all her life in quiet bloemfontein without at least hearing something of the
fierce activities of the little english world so near at hand

   his wifes assurances silenced the young mans arguments but he still
grumbled  anyhow it was not needed you should strike me so hard with
your foot

    sorry if i hurt rou but had to act quick it would be better for you
to have your hand broken short off than be sent to that inferno-convict life
in cape town ill post rou up on the situation for ive taken a liking to
in jeopardy from diamonds



you and want to keep you out of harm if i can  and what i tell you must be
kept right handy in your mind for steady use and not packed away in a
pigeon hole with all that can be done to prevent it the stealing of
diamonds from the mines is a big item last year it amounted to 
worth estimated on the shipments of unregistered diamonds from cape town
stolen from the mines and sold to the illicit diamond buyers but for the
market they make there would be little temptation to steal diamonds among
the blacks any way who have most chances as it is the thief gets a
little the receiver of stolen goods gets the stone and the de beers consoli-
dated mines company gets left so the law is merciless  the i d b and
merety having in possession a diamond that is not registered and the legiti-
mate purchase of which cannot be clearly traced and proved is sufficient
proof of guilt to insure conviction a man arrested as an i d b is as-
sumed to be guilty until he proves himself innocent in  the penalty
was twelve months imprisonment in  it was made three years and a
fine of  soon after the term of imprisonment was raised to five years
and then to fifteen as a maximum with a fine that may be as high as a
thousand pounds  

     if a man  just finds a little diamond   

   yes and maybe if he hasnt even seen one half of the fine goes to
the informer who causes the arrest that is inducement enough for a lot of
scoundrels to put up jobs for getting diamonds into the hands of innocent
persons and then pouncing on them they lay stones in the street and watch
to see some unwary fool pick them up  slip a stone into a mans pocket or
drop it in his room then arrest follows if you had picked up the diamond
you saw within an hour an officer would have found it in your pocket and
all you and we could have said and sworn to would not have cleared you
from liability to fifteen years on the breakwater and   fine

     great heavens  what horrible inj ustice in a christian land  does
not the law punish such  put up jobs as you call it for entrapping the
innocent   

     no it is a regular recognized industry

    	 minna this is a place of fiends and fiends law  it affrights me  i
wish to leave it at once i know the mules are weary and night has fallen
but better it is that we go quickfy away and outspan on the veldt than
remain here i shall not breathe freely until i am back in the orange free
state among our honest boers  

    but minna was reluctant to leave at that hour mr perkins said he would
not be in much danger if he was prudent and after considerable persuasion
styne submitted to taking his chances until morning when he vowed he
would surely depart straightway for home

     how long have you ventured to stay here   he asked his new found
friend

      about two years  

     and they have played no  put up jobs  on you  

    put up jobs dont work  yankees and jews why there are jews

in jeopardy from diamonds

one solomon jacobs living openly and boldly in the transvaal hotel-and a
real nice good hearted old fellow he is outside his trade-who there is good
reason to believe gets thousands of pounds worth of diamonds across the
border every year yet though he has been arrested a score of times they
never could hold him

   mr perkins though he did not see fit to mention the fact was one of the
most valued detectives in the employ of the de beers company and spoke
with full knowledge when he told of the boldness cunning and success of the
jew whom he pointed out that evening to the young hollander styne was
frankly amazed mr jacobs was a small man thin gentle looking with a
fine sensitive face and considerably past middle age could it be possible
he asked himself in wonder that one apparently so weak and amiable had the
daring to defy the fiends and fiends law of kimberley 

   the young couple retired early for not until they were locked in their
room did styne feel himself safe even for one moment from some diabolical
job to make him out an i d b the night was abominabl hot  those iron
bedrooms were like ovens  styne feared to leave the windows open  no air
seemed to enter through the transom over the door  and altogether even
without his anxieties they were very uncomfortable for a newly wedded
couple on their bridal tour but by eleven oclock weariness at last brought
sleep

   an hour later they were rudely awakened by the clamor of voices tramp-
ling of feet and sounds as of a scuffle in an adjoining room styne believed
he recognized one of the voices as that of mr jacobs and he was right
the companys detectives had learned that solomon was in possession of a lot
of  illicit   diamonds gathered by his secret agents in kimberley he ex-
pected to run them across the border-only two miles distant-into the free
state hoping to catch him   dead to rights   before he got away in the
morning they had planned to surprise him in bed at midnight and search
him when he would probably be least prepared for such a visitation

    it is an outrage   the little man shrilly protested while struggling in
their hands i do not believe ou are officers help help you are
robbers  let me go  let those clothes alone  drop that valise  nothing in
it concerns you-if you are not thieves if you are my money and watch
are under my pillow you can take them without choking the life out of
me

   surely it was the voice of elnathan perkins they heard make reply
 come now solomon clap the brake on that nimble tongue of yours you
know well enough who we are and that were doing nothing but our duty
you know me and you know hodgson here and moss this isnt the first
time youve played leading man in the sensational drama  troubles of an i
d b 

    but you never found anything on me

    no up to date you have been too smart to be caught and we admire
you for it but that makes it all the more a matter of professional pride to
gather you in and well keep on trying as long as you keep on buying

   oh well if that is your game merely perpetrating one of your
in jeopardy from diamonds



customary outrages upon innocent persons to make pretense of earning your
salaries go ahead-search away-and much good may it do you

   if styne could have seen as well as he heard he would have been amused
by the blank look of discomfiture upon the faces of the officers even mr
jacobs grinned appreciatively as he looked at them they understood very
well that when he invited them to search he was very sure they would find
nothing no doubt he had heard them coming-stealthy as they had been
until the moment of bursting in his door-and had thrown the diamonds out
of the window to an accomplice watching outside in that case his resist-
ance had been simply to gain time for the other man to get away

    all the same remarked perkins answering the unspoken thoughts of
his associates it may be a bluff we had better search him and do it
thoroughly

   they did so but unavailiugly there was not a diamond even so big as
a pins head in his room-unless he had swallowed it all the while he
attacked them with sarcasms gibes and defiance for he felt himself safe
they heard him without making reply but to some extent revenged them-
selves by taking him away and locking him up in a cell while they planned a
further hunt for his accomplice that a number of valuable diamonds had
passed into his possession since nightfall they knew positively the question
was-what had he done with them 

   it seemed to styne when quiet reigned again as if lightning had struck
very close to him  minna he said  much better it would be to lie out
on the veldt with a lion looking on than remain where such deeds are
done  

    but if the man had diamonds that were stolen 

     did you not hear him say he had not  and they found none yet
they dragged him away to prison  

     that is true

    i am minded to get the mules out and start at once without waiting for
daylight the moon is good

   	might not such an unusual start provoke suspicion that you are carry-
ing off diamonds and so perhaps cause your arrest   

    heavens  that horrible idea had not occurred to me but i perceive it
is true we must remain well then let us sleep

   but there was to be no more sleep for the young couple that night
hardly half an hour had elapsed when men came knocking loudly upon
stynes door demanding admittance hodgson and moss had evolved the
hypothesis that the wary jew having scented his danger when they were
almost upon him had thrown his diamonds into some other room trusting to
recover them in the morning or even electing to abandon them rather than
suffer the severe penalty for having them in his possession and they
reasoned as he could have had little time to spare he probably ran no farther
than the next room search there would clearly be advisable so saying
nothing to perkins of whom the two englishmen had a professional jealousy
they hurried back to the transvaal hotel and to stynes door when told
that the young hollander had ordered his team for a very early hour in the
o

in jeopardy from diamonds

morning they very readily readjusted their theory to fit the new facts
he is solomons carrier they said his wife is only a shield to avert
suspicion and he doubtless has the diamonds now

   when minna was dressed styne opened the door and in mingled anger
and alarm demanded his visitors business

    to arrest you as an i d b and get those diamonds you were going to
run across the line in the morning and you had better give them up at
once replied hodgson

   styne almost fainted with horror but conscious innocence sustained him
they cannot harm me he said to himself  they must find diamonds
in my possession first the american said so and i who have never
owned or had in my hand a diamond even a glass one am sure they will find
none

   but while he was reassuring himself with those reflections and striving to
encourage minna the men were searching and presently one of them utter-
ing a shout of triumph snatched up some small object from the floor

    it was a little buckskin bag half full of diamonds

   tossed through the transom it had fallen in the room before the couple
awoke then when they hastily dressed themselves in the dark stynes
jacket had accidentally fallen upon it from the back of a chair so that when
found it had the appearance of having been concealed in vain the amazed
and horror stricken young man protested that he knew nothing about it

   tell that to the marines answered moss sneeringly you had
them hidden under your jacket and if you aint an i d b there are none
about fifteen years on the breakwater is what youre safe for

   minna uttered a shriek and threw herself into her husbands arms

    i swear to you cried styne in a voice of anguish  by my honorable
name by my fathers gray hairs by my dear wife here by my hopes of
heaven that i have not known anything of those diamonds or any others
aud all i wish is to get away to bloemfontein and never see kimberley or a
diamond again

    youll find it a long journey to bloemfontein by way of cape town
grinned moss

   oh styne they must not take you away from me lb will kill me
sobbed minna embracing him

   break away there cried hodgson jocosely we have no time to
waste get your hat and come along young man

   oh sir pleaded the young wife he is innocent indeed he is
you will do a cruel wrong if you arrest him we only came to see the mines
it is our bridal trip and he is only a little while from rotterdam he
knows nothing about diamonds

   a likely story that laughed moss  a rotterdamer and not know
diamonds  id bet mj life he is an agent for some big dutch diamond cut-
ting house but thats neither here or there now he had them in posses-
sion and thats enough

   wretched minna fell swooning upon the bed before she recovered-
which was not for a long time notwithstanding the sympathetic kindness of
in jeopardy from diamonds



mr constable manager of the hotel and a couple of ladies who gave their
aid-styne had been led away to prison

   eluathan perkins was rather taken aback when told of his comrades
achievements but that feeling did not last long im sorry you snaked in
that young dutchman he said  i sized him up before hed been in the
town an hour and youre dead wrong theres no more harm in him than
there is in a spring lamb why i saved him from the drop game myself
jacobs chucked the diamonds in there-ive no doubt of that-but they knew
nothing about it and i think youre both fair minded men enough to help
me in a scheme ive got for getting at the plain truth

   so they were if there were any reasonable grounds to doubt styues
guilt they delighted in hunting down the right man but had no desire to
unjustly persecute the wrong one after some deliberation they gave their
assent to perkins plan subject to its approval by the chief of their force
which the yankee readily obtained

   solomon jacobs was kept a close prisoner in his cell all the next day
until late in the afternoon and allowed to see no one not even an attorney
who blustered loudly but ineffectively over the violation of his clients rights
finally blnathan perkins strolled through the prison corridor in front of the
old mans cell and was hailed by him with a shrill 

    hey  see here  you  how much longer am i to be kept here
without an examination  without seeing my counsel  without even
knowing of what i am accused   

   youll get all the examination you will want tomorrow replied the
yankee coldlj you would have had it today only the court adjourned
early on account of what happened at your partners trial

    my partner  exclaimed the jew in a tone of surprised inquiry

   yes havent you heard about it yet i should have thought some
one would have told you  

  no nobody has told me anything what is it who is my
partner  

   the young dutchman in the room next yours the diamonds were
found in his possession- carats of them-and as it was a clear case they
railroaded him this morning

    they railroaded him   echoed the old man in a hollow voice

   yes fifteen years on the breakwater and  fine it was more
than he could stand he has just been married and the idea of being sent
away from his young wife all the best years of his life turned his head
when he was sentenced he jerked a pistol out of the belt of an officer
standing near him and before he could be seized shot himself through the
head and fell dead right there in court and his wife a right pretty
young boer woman seeing what he did went crazy and was carried out
screaming the doctors say she will never regain her senses  

   after elnathan ceased speaking solomon jacobs stood as if paralyzed
with a look of unutterable horror in his widely dilated eyes then his thin
white hands flung above his head feebly beat the air and with his pale lips
working convulsively but making no sound he tottered backward until he


in jeopardy from diamonds

sank down in a sitting posture on his bench but in an instant as if revived
by that momentary support he sprang up leaped forward to his cell door and
shook it with frenzied force screaming i dont believe you  it is a lie 
you are trying to madden me with your horrible stories  such things could
not be  it is too infernal to be true  

   elnathan silently held up before him the buckskin bag which he in an
instant recognized it seemed to overwhelm him with conviction and fas-
cinate him with horror slowly he sank down upon his knees his hair brist-
ling his teeth chattering and his eyes staring  then his forehead fell forward
against the iron grating and he dropped to the floor in a swoon

   hodgson and moss who had been standing near but out of sight started
forward at the sound of his fall perkins restrained them by a gesture
opened the cell door and stepped inside gently he lifted the old man laid
him upon the bench sprinkled water upon his face and so gradually brought
him back to consciousness but in a wildly hysterical condition

    murderers   he shrieked  murderers  you have slain an innocent
man  god will requite his blood upon you  the lad knew nothing of the
stones  and his poor young wife  oh  it was worse than murder what
you have done to her the curse of innocent blood is on your diamonds  
 no replied elnathan in a tone so firm and stern that it arrested the
attention of the excited old man and compelled his compre hension    you
murdered him-when you threw the bag into his room his blood is upon
your head   

     i did it oh  yes god forgive me  i did it that is true it
was my fault-but i meant no harm to him no matter  i did it take me
out and hang me i deserve to die for the blood i have caused to be shed
that is just but thou oh  god of my fathers knowest my heart  thou
mighty and all wise judge knowest that blood guiltiness is not upon my soul
though i have slain the innocent

   in his impassioned excitement he incoherently raved supplications self
accusations pleadings and prayers while with fingers that writhed like ser-
pents he clutched and tore at his throat and breast until the garments upon
them were rent to tatters

    then you admit that the diamonds w ere yours and that you threw them
into the young mans room demanded the yankee in a hard insistent
voice that pierced and dominated the unhappy mans wandering mind

    yes oh yes what do i care what i admit now my life is done i
did not think they would be looked for there and i knew he was an honest
young man who would give them back to me in the morning i was wrong to
call you murderers i am the murderer only i you are simply bloodhounds
it is your nature to hunt to the death questions of innocence or guilt do
not trouble you do with me what you will i alone am guilt

   hodgson and moss stepped forward while hewas speaking he saw them
but did not heed their presence he spoke in a high key rapidly like a
madman and when he stopped turned flung himself face dowmward upon
the bench with his arms about his head and abandoned himself to a
paroxysm of grief
in jeopardy from diamonds



   the three officers went out silently locking the door behind them and
consulted together in another room

    my scheme has worked too derned well said elnathan perkins look-
ing troubled ive got the truth out of him but ill be consumedly
jiggered if i like the state of mind ive put him in and i dont see how to
square myself on my necessary lie and ease him up i never imagined the
old fellow had so much heart pies mighty near crazy and im afraid to tell
him right out it was a fake story for fear of breaking him up altogether
and id hate to do that for hes white inside even if he is an i d b

    right you are responded hodgson and im blamed sorry for him
myself which is more than i ever thought i should be for one of his trade
and any way the deal goes he is bound to get the worst of the game  

   so he is assented perkins his confession clears the dutchman
right enough but it goes against my grain to think of his being a convict all
the rest of his life because he had heart enough to forget himself in his feeling
for another and my part in it hurts me i feel as if i had extorted that
confession from him on the rack boys  if we cant somehow get him out
of this scrape i shall chuck up this bloodhound business

   the three detectives had a long interview with the local magistrate before
he opened court the next morning and the tale they told to him moved his
sympathy for the old jew very strongly  i would be willing he said

  to suspend sentence  him as long as he remains away from kimberley
he has suffered enough but how is he to be told the truth without the
greatest danger to his mind and even his life  he is evidently a man of very
sensitive organization you have assumedan awful responsibility mr perkins
do not understand me as censuring your action i quite approve of it-
though i should hardly have ventured to take it myself but have you
thought of any way out of this very disagreeable situation 

  yes sir and your willingness to suspend sentence on him indefinitely
makes it practicable you will have me detailed to take him to bloemfon-
tein and bring back his engagement never to return here we will start
tonight with van veys and his wife who will be released now i presume  
 certainly there is nothing against them is there 

    no nothing they will have to assist me jacobs first relief wall be
the discovery that the young wifes senses have been restored his second
that styne is still alive with hopes of recovery and that we have him in
the wagon taking him home the dutchman will lie on a mattrass with
bandages around his head at the start any way before we get to bloemfon-
tein i shall have slipped the whole truth into jacobs mind

   the yankees plan was carried through successfully solomon jacobs not
only very willingly gave his pledge that he would never revisit kimberley
but announced that he had formally and forever abandoned the diamond busi-
ness he forgave mr perkins for that lesson of horror but vowed he could
never look at a diamond without painful recollection of it as for styne and
minna they were very sure that they would never again wish to cross the
boundary line of the orange free state

the bunkel mystery

how the robbery of the rival banks became a matter of strange coincidences-far reaching
and totally unexpected results of an act of gallantry-the battles on bunkel
island and the frustrating of carefully laid plans

ci-iaptkr i-a gallant young man

   ake montoban was very much in the shape of a pair of eyeglasses

      on the section of land which projected out into it in the middle was a
considerable hill which went by the name of nosemount and if the two
parts of the lake were the eyes this elevation certainly answered very well
for the nose on the opposite shore was another point of land covered with
rocky cliffs

   above and below nosemount the lake was five miles wide but it was
only two between the eyes of the glasses forming a strait or channel
almost in this channel was bunkel island half a mile from the nose as un-
romantic people called the hill it contained two acres of rocks covered
with trees where there was soil enough to give them a hold

   coming through the strait between bunkel island and nosemount which
was about half a mile wide was a small sloop it contained two young men
one of whom appeared to be instructing the other in the art of sailing a
boat the course was dead to windward and the sloop was beating through
the strait she had nearly reached a point where she could take a long tack
across the broad lake

   what was that andy asked the young man at the helm who was
very nicely dressed though he did not appear to take very good care of his
high cost garments

   the young man who looked as though he might be sixteen years old was
not a little excited and he had alriiost allowed the sloop to come up into the
wind when his companion pointed at the shaking mainsail

   i dont know what it was phin but it sounded like the scream of a
woman replied andy but mind your helm and we shall soon know
what it was  

    it sounded like the scream of a person in distress added phin as he
brought the boat to her bearings again  perhaps some boat has upset

    it may be  but if any one needs help the better you sail the boat the
sooner we shall reach him

 it was a woman a man or a boy dont give such a yell as that was

    whoever it was the sound came from just the other side of the island
and we shall soon see what the matter is said andy as he looked ahead
 mind your helm phin you are letting her come to again and we shall never
find out at this rate
the bunkel mystery



     you neednt blow me up for it retorted phin as he put the helm up

    all right i wont say another word answered andy fixing his gaze
on the point of the island which concealed from him the person who had given
the scream

    the eyes of the one at the tiller were riveted upon the same point and he
was more concerned to ascertain the occasion of the scream than he was to
sail the boat properly as the result of his distracted attention the mainsail
shook and then rushed over to the port side andy did not say a word but
left the skipper to manage things in his own way

    the sloop had reached a point where she was more exposed to the full
force of the wind than she had been in the strait and it was necessary that
the skipper should be wide awake but phin barkpool was one of the  lords
of creation and even the winds and the waters ought to obey him according
to his idea andy let him have his own way and neither said nor did any-
thing

     why dont you tell me what to do andy   demanded phin disgusted
at the failure of his own efforts to get the boat into working order again

     the only thing to do is to give attention to the boat replied andy as
he took an oar and brought the bow around so that the sails filled on the
former tack

   here and you take the tiller added phin as he rose from his
seat

     just as jou say phin said the other s he took his place at the helm
and soon had the boat leaping over the little waves

     i want to know what that scream means and i was looking out for the
woman that gave it continued phin who thought an apology for his failure
was necessary

     you will soon see

   and he did  for andy gave his whole attention to the working of the
sloop and she almost doubled her speed under his management after calcu-
lating his chances of weathering the point ahead he tacked a minute later
another sloop came in sight with a raft in tow

     there she is   shouted phin boiling over in the excitement of the
moment   there is a girl in her  but what did she scream for   

     that is more than i know replied andy as he devoted himself to an
examination of the craft and those on board of her   that is the diana 
and the girl must be di singerlay   

    as the breeze was fresh and fair the diana in spite of the handicap of
the raft upon her sailing had made considerable progress since the fair
skipper screamed and she was now not more than a quarter of a mile from
the island andy trimmed the sail very carefully and compelled the milly
which was the sloop he was sailing to do her best

     help  help    came from the diana and the appeal was introduced
by another ringing scream which was echoed in the distance by the rocks
on bunkelisland

     what in the world is the matter with her  she screeches like a wild
owl said phin

      e


the bunkel mystery

   it is easy enough too see what the matter is replied andy almost as
much excited as his companion though he still attended carefully to the sail-
ing of the sloop

    i dont see what she is yelling for added phin

   do you know who the fellow is at the tiller of the diana asked
andy controlling his indignation for that was what now boiled up in his
being

    it looks like tom sawder answered pliin

   it is tom sawder i cant imagine how he got into that boat but he
is there and he has taken possession of her andy explained to his less
perceptive companion  di would not let him get into her boat and she is
calling for help

    let her call said phin settling back in his place on the cushioned seat
of the standing room

   the nicely dressed young man seemed suddenly to have lost all interest in
the adventure although it- required no little effort on his part he turned
his gaze away from the diana and the raft and looked with all his might at
the summit of nosemount it was hard work to do so but he denied
himself the privilege of another glance at the scene which had absorbed all
his attention a few minutes before

     help  help    screamed diana singerlay again

   the milly was now within a hundred feet of the diana and the ugly face
of tom sawder could be distinctly seen  so could the glowing features and
even the snapping expression of di it was plain enough to andy lamb that
it was indignation and not fear that crimsoned the fair face and lighted up
the dark eyes of the fair skipper

   shut up di dont do that again or ill have to bat you andy
heard tom say to the indignant maiden

   andrew lamb was a pluck and gallant fellow and he was almost as angry
as the girl herself when he heard the brutal threat of the hoodlum tom
sawder was a fighting character and andy was not tom boasted that he
could whip any fellow of his size in montoban and andy had never been in
a fight in his life but the lamb boiled with indignation all the same and
had no unwholesome dread of the sawder lion

   i dont want to know anything more about that scrape said phin
still gazing at the nose   head her for home now andy  

    we are going as close to the wind as we can replied the helmsman
seeing that his present course would take the milly between the diana and
bunkel island  we are headed for home as near as we can go

    then come about and let her go on the other tack added phin very
decidedly

    tom sawder has taken her boat away from diana added and sup-
pressing as much as he could his indignation at the outrage though some of
it was apparent in his look and in his tones

    i dont care if he has thats none of my business and none of yours
either andy lamb replied phin groutily as though he was rather ashamed
of the position he had taken  come about i say  
the bunkel mystery



     phin do you really mean to let that girl lose her boat and be insulted
by tom sawder    asked andy earnestly

     of course i do its none of my business

      as much your business as it is mine  

     well its none of your business then  

     i dont want to leave the young lady in the hands of that fellow per-
sisted andy

     no more talk about it  i told you to come about   said phin in the
most emphatic manner

     i wont doit   replied andy gently but firmly

     you wont   exclaimed phin springing to his feet

     no i will not it would be mean and disgraceful to leave the girl in the
hands of that fellow  

     do you own this boat andy lamb   demanded phin his face red with
auger

     no i dont own it and in two minutes more i will get out of it
answered andy

     do you know whose daughter that girl is  asked phin in a tone that
he thought ought to settle matteis

   of course i do but because her father and yours are enemies di
singerlay ought not to be abused by that villain replied andy

      give me the tiller    and phin sprang forward to take it from his com-
panion

    andy simpfy raised his arm to prevent him from doing so

   do you mean to take the boat away from me demanded phin
retreating a couple of steps and looking with astonishment at the son of a
poor man who dared to oppose his imperial will

     by no means phin replied andy  i am going to leap  board of
the diana and then you can take the tiller

     do you mean to desert me  asked phin

    andy made  reply for the milly was close to the bow of the sloop
putting the helm down he made a long spring and reached the half deck of
the diana

chapter ii-the champion of the fair skipper

    andy had brought the milly about so that she went aft on the starboard
tack and he made his long leap while her sails were shaking phin had
nothing to do but meet her with the helm as she headed away from the
diana if he was disposed to resent the desertion as he called it of his
companion it was too late and he seated himself at the tiller

   though phin was not much of a boatman he knew enough to take the
sloop back to moutoban the fresh breeze soon carried him out of hearing
of the diana he was vexed and even angry at andys conduct though
he could not help himself but he had enough to think about for the one
thing he needed most as a boatman was confidence and the sloop heeled over
when the flaws came in a manner to make him rather nervous


the bunkel mystery

   andy brought up on the half deck of the diana tom sawder was at
the tiller and di singerlay was seated in the standing room as far as she could
get from her brutal companion her cheeks still glowed with the indigna-
tion which had not subsided for the hoodlum was still in possession

    i didnt ask you to come into this boat andy lamb said tom rising
in his place and looking rather more belligerent than usual

    i know you didnt but miss singerlay did replied audy stepping
down into the standing room by the side of the fair skipper   i came at her
call and not yours

    im ruunin this boat jest now le me tell you continued toni with a
scowl which wtas intended to produce an impression  the newcomer

    i know very well that the sloop belongs to miss singerlay and if she
wants you to run it i have nothing to say but she screamed and called for
help that is the reason i am here replied andy

    i dont find no fault with your bein here cause i want you to help me
put them boards on bunkel island added tom with a coarse grin  but

i	want you to know im runnin this boat

   audy looked at the fair skipper to see if she had objections to the arrange-
ment proposed by the hoodlum

    he was on that raft and he shouted half a dozen times for help and
said he should be drowned if i did not save him said di half choked with
emotion as soon as i took him in he made me give him the helm i a
word he took the boat away from me  

    thats all so i liaint got a word to say agin any ont replied tom
with another grin as though he thought his operations were all regular  i
want the boat to get them boards over to bunkel then im goin back home
and she can have the boat again

    but you have stolen the boat from miss singerlay tom sawder pro-
tested andy

    i dont want no sass andy lamb  and the fist that was not on the
tiller was clenched as though he meant what he said

    thats it andy he took the boat away from me he stole it   ex-
claimed di her indignation beginning to boil again as she rehearsed the out-
rage  i was ready to save him but im not going to be treated in this
manner  

    i guess you cant help yourself di added tom

     i came on board to assist you miss singerlay and i will do what you
desire said andy  but he felt that in making this offer he was taking a
big contract ou his hands

   tom sawder was both older and heavier than andy and he was a thorough
bruiser besides so that the odds seemed to be all against the champion of the
fair skipper but he wras old fashioned enough to believe there was a great
deal in being on the right side the wretch had committed an outrage upon
a young lady in taking her boat from her and he had heard the hoodlum
threaten to   bat   her if she again called for help

    i want my boat and that is all i want replied di

    she cant have it till i git done with it said tom
the bunkel mystery



    this boat dont belong to you tom sawder and you have no right to
use it against the wishes of the owner continued andy as he took a step
towards the reprobate

    i dont want to argy andy you mind your own business replied
tom as he seated himself at the side of the tiller  for it did not occur to him
that and could think of standing up against such a bruiser as he was

     it is my business to assist this young lady in her trouble and i shall do
it returned andy in his mild way she wants her boat and she shall
have it  

   andy went to the cleat where the rope attached to the raft was made fast
and proceeded to cast it off tom sprang to his feet and appeared to be even
more astonished than angry

   what are you about andy lamb what are you gon to do   de-
manded he

   i am going to cast off this line and let that raft go adrift replied
andy in the same matter of fact tone

    no you wont   roared tom thoroughly aroused by this time

   tom sawder drew back a step and then aimed a blow with his fist at the
head of the young ladys champion but andy was skilled in the art though
he had never had any serious practice with his science and was ready for
him he had been on his guard and he parried the blow artistically he
realized that it would be useless merely to stand upon the defensive he did
not take fire like a barrel of shavings but like a keg of gunpowder and the
blow aimed at his head was quite enough to  touch him off

   as he parried the heavy blow of the bruiser with his left hand he struck
with his right and planted a sledge hammer hit squarely between the two
eyes of his opponent andy had pounded a bag of sand enough to know how
to do it and to harden his fist for such work tom reeled back towards the
tiller under the effect of the blow

   but fighting more than anything else was his trade and though he was
utterly astonished at the result of the onslaught his confidence did not desert
him in two seconds he renewed the attack andy looked his ground over
at a glance and retreated a step towards di ready to enter upon the serious
business of the encounter he had a plan and he arranged it so that the
bruiser should stand near the rail when he made the next assault

   tom advanced furiously this time and began to strike out with all his
might andy got hit though he fended off most of the blows of his antago-
nist he watched his opportunity and then he rushed  his heavy oppo-
nent with his blood at the boiling point he rained his blows upon toms
head and crowded him against the washboard of the boat just where he
wanted him he made up in elasticity what he lacked in strength and got
in two blows to one of toms

   when he had the bruiser in the desired position he concentrated all his
force upon him and pressed him with all the vigor he could bring upon him
the washboard was the impediment which tom could not overcome and as
he was crowded against it he went over backwards into the lake precisely as
andy had planned the result if his powers could accomplish it
o

the bunkel mystery

     andy looked as though he had been through the wars for his face
  was covered with blood and where it was not bloody it was red enough to
  light a match upon he was almost strangled for the want of breath for he
  had exhausted his lungs in the fierce struggle he seated himself at the
  tiller gasping for breath though he had the presence of mind to put the
  helm up and keep the sloop from broaching to as she was in the act of
  doing

      tom sawder was in the lake and in no better physical condition than his
  late antagonist as the boat went ahead he seized hold of the craft and
  held himself there till he could recover his wind andy looked at him and
  as he thought he was in a perilous situation he put the helm down and
  checked the headway of the boat

      help  help  i cant swim and i shall be drownded   gasped tom

      you cant play that game again replied andy struggling for breath
  to utter the words  hold on to the raft and you will be all right

       i cant hold on  yelled tom

        then drown    replied andy

     however he did not mean that for he would have jumped overboard to
  save the life of the bully if it had been necessary  but he did not intend to
  have him in the boat again neither of the late opponents was disposed to
  talk for the want of breath the diana lay with her sails shaking and
  tom had no difficulty in keeping on the top of the water after the raft ceased
  to go ahead

      in five minutes they had recovered their breath and all of tom sawders
  bad blood came back to him his first effort was to secure a better position
  and after several trials and much splashing he succeeded in climbing upon
  the rickety structure

     you dont fight fair andy lamb was the bruisers first criticism
  upon the late encounter

       i dont fight at all when i can help it responded andy very quietly

      were gon to have this over agin and fair or foul ill lick you within
  a quarter of an inch of your life shouted tom almost mad enough to cry

      andy filled away again and headed for the island

chapter iii-a reinforcement of hoodidms

      ajvdv zramb concluded that it was best not to notice the vaporing threats
oi tiie brziser on tiie raft tfijicii were uttered more for his own consolation
than for the benefit of such a foe as his conqueror had proved to be tom
could not exactly understand how he had been defeated for such an event
had never happened to him before how a fellow who never fought had beaten
him was beyond his comprehension

   you have had a terrible battle andy said di when she had succeeded
in quieting her nerves which had been badly shaken by the savage fight she
had witnessed	

  it was rather warm but there was no avoiding it answered andy
with a smile for he could not help smiling when he looked at her pretty face
the bunkel mystery

i

    are you much hurt andy   she asked with no little sympathy in her
tones and looks

    not much i think the blood makes a good deal of show  and i may
have a pair of black eyes tomorrow for that fellow hits hard and is used to
this sort of thing  

    but you hit harder than he did andy added di with a triumphant
expression on her face

    when i got him against the washboard he couldnt handle himself i
planned to get him pinched into that position and that was where i got the
advantage replied andy		-

     i am ever so much obliged to you for what you have done  i am sure
there is not another young man in montoban who would have fought such a
battle for me or for any other young lady added di blushing and modify-
ing her statement so that it should not be so closely applicable to herself

    i never was in a fight before and i never shall be again if i can help
it 

   	if i had thought it would have been such a serious matter i would not
have had you engage in it for the world  

    i did not see any way to avoid it

    i might have submitted suggested di

    submitted to what  asked andy looking her in the face

   i mean that i might have let him use the boat she replied with
another crimson flush

     i am afraid i should not have had the courage to fight for the boat i
was afraid he would subject you to insult and even violence for i heard him
threaten to bat you andy explained  he is a bad fellow

    i know he is  and i had my doubts about taking him into the boat i
would not do it till he said he should be drowned  

   by this time the diana wlth her tow was within fifty feet of the shore of
bunkel island andy slowly hauled in the main sheet as he put the helm
down until he had brought the raft within a couple of rods of the land

    now miss singerlay if you will take the tiller i will rid you of your
troublesome companion said andy rising from his seat

    do you mean yourself andy  asked di keeping her seat

    i meant tom sawder replied andy laughing   but if you find me
a troublesome companion i am willing to leave ou though i dont care
about landing on the same island with tom

     i did not think that i had any companion but you  and i kept my seat
because i did not mean to let you leave me said di with another blush
 but i understand you now and i will take the tiller

   as andy vacated his seat for her he glanced at the shore a movement
there excited his attention he continued to look but he could not detect
any motion he was almost sure that he had seen a man pass from behind a
stunted savin to the shelter of a mass of rocks no one lived on the island
and hardly ever did any one land there

    i am almost certain that i saw a man on the island said andy as he
went to the cleat at which the painter of the raft was secured


the bunkel mystery

     a man  some one may have landed on the other side suggested di
as she looked at the island

      i have j list been entirely around the island with pliineas barkpool but
we did not see a boat anywhere perhaps it was not a man that i saw
though i think it was replied andy as he cast off the painter of the raft

   what are you gon to do now demanded tom sawder as andy
threw the painter into the water

     i understood you to say that you were bound to bunkel island here
you are and you neednt thank us for towing you where you wanted to go
returned andy lightly

     are you gou to leave me here  

       that is j ust what we mean to do  

     how do you think im gon to git back  

    we have not considered that question and we leave you to settle it to
suit yourself said andy as the diana passed out of talking distance of the
raft

     i am exceedingly glad to get rid of the wretch and i hope i shall never
meet him again especially when you are not near andy said di as she
looked at the bruiser who had taken his paddle and was working the raft to
the shore

      i hope i shall be near if you meet him under such disagreeable circum-
stances again   added andy   but i would give something to know whether
or not there is a man on the island  

    with this wind it will not take long to sail around it and i was going
to make that trip if the wind did not blow too hard we will go now if you
like suggested di 

    andy did not think it was quite proper for a young lady to sail alone with
a young man  but he assented for his curiosity was excited di filled away
and steered for the strait

    by this time the milly had made some progress in the direction of mon-
tobau though not more than half as much as she would have made if andy
had remained on board

    phin barkpool felt himself very much aggrieved at the course of andy
not so much because he had deserted him as he was pleased to call it as
because he had done so to assist the daughter of his fathers bitter enemy
the war between the two houses of singerlay and barkpool had been carried
on for two years in the most relentless manner it extended to every mem-
ber of thefamily and into the social and business relations of the town

    the diana had hardly disappeared behind a point of the island before
phin discovered a row boat just ahead of him containing three young fellows
of the hoodlum order in fact they were the three other members of the
quartette of which tom sawder was the chief

   have you seen tom sawder on the lake today phin asked bob
rottle who was in the stern of the boat with the tiller lines in his hand

    yes and he has had an awful time of it replied the skipper of the
milly as he came to so that he could tell the hoodlums the news   there
has been a fight
the bunkel mystery	

    a fight   exclaimed all of them at once with eager interest for they
were all toms true disciples

       twixt who    demanded bob rottle

    between tom and andy lamb answered phin

    then tom knocked his eyes out of his head added josh boole

   no he didnt andy knocked him overboard and then took him to
buukel   and phin told the whole story as he understood it and was sorry
tom had not been the victor in the battle

    give us a tow will you phin  we are tired of rowing  and you can bet
there is going to be another fight down to bunkel if andy lamb dont run
off   said bob rottle

   phin barkpool had not the slightest objection to seeing- andy thrashed
after the events of the day and he took the painter of the row boat and made
it fast to the stern of the milly besides he was afraid of the trio of hood-
lums and it was not prudent to refuse the request the course was nearly
before the wind and in a short time the skipper cast off his tow near the
spot where tom had landed they pulled the rest of the way  but before
they reached the rock which served as a wharf tom came down to the water

   the chief of the hoodlums wore a leather belt and when he appeared to
his chosen followers on the present occasion a pair of revolvers were thrust
into it on the left hand side so that he looked something like a walking
arsenal his face was terribly battered by the hard fist of andy lamb
though he had washed the blood from it and this was probably the first time
in the current month that he had done such a thing as wash his face

   hi  hi  hi   shouted bob rottle as soon as he saw his chief
 twig the shooters in his belt  

    my eyes   cried buck fishier

    bully for tom   added josh boole

   where have you been all day demanded tom imperiously as the
boat touched the rock   i thought to see you two hours ago  

    we couldnt get the boat any sooner replied bob rottle who appeared
to be the second in influence in the gang  i say tom where did you get
all them shooters   

   ask me no lies and ill tell you no questions replied tom face-
tiously and with a smile on his battle stained face for he was pleased to have
his inferiors notice his armor-

    but where did you get the shooters  persisted bob  cant we get
some in the same place   

    no you cant  these were sent to me as a free gift by m granny and
she haint no more on em

   he certainly had not brought them from montoban on the raft  and he
would certainly have used them if he had had them in his fight with andy
at least to frighten him but tom insisted that where and how he had
obtained these weapons should remain a mystery

    had a fight and got licked phin barkpool sas continued bob rottle
when he gave up the attempt to penetrate the mystery of the revolvers

    who sas i got licked   demanded tom


                                      

the bunkel mystery

      phin barkpool says so  and says andy knocked you into the lake  
replied josh boole

     its a lie  if phin or any other feller says that ill knock him out of
his boots returned tom  my foot slipped and i fell out of the boat
audy liaiut seen the end ont ive been waitin for this boat to finish him
ill lick andy till there aint pothin left on him  and then ill chaw him up
into sarsingers concluded tom ferociously

    just then the diana came in sight and the boat containing the hoodlums
started for her

   audy lamb was running into deadly peril and the odds were heavily
against him

chapter iv-the strategy of tom sawder

    the diana had been around bunkel island and andy lamb had carefully
examined the shore at every point and opening without seeing a boat or even
a raft upon which a person could cross the strait he had looked in among
the trees and rocks as well as he could without discovering a human being

    as no one was likely to be on the island without the means of getting to
and from the mainland he was forced to believe almost against the evidence
of his own senses that he had been mistaken when he thought he saw a man
dodge from the shadow of a tree to the shelter of the rocks

     i was almost sure that i saw a man on the island said andy as the
sloop came in sight of the shore where the encounter with tom sawder had
taken place   i saw him move from a tree to the rocks  

    how could he get there without a boat   asked di

     he may have hauled the boat on shore replied andy  but i should
have seen it if he had 

     i think you must have been mistaken andy added the fair skipper
with a smile

    of course i may have been mistaken miss singerlay and it looks as
though i had been

      what could any man be doing on the island   

   that is more than i know if there is a man there he is taking a
great deal of trouble to conceal himself added audy as lie again cast his
eyes over all that could be seen of the island

   though all the evidence was against him andy was not satisfied he
felt so sure he had seen a man-not a bo-that he found it very difficult to
accept as conclusive the testimony of the facts somehow the island seemed
to be quite different from what it had ever been before for the question he
had been considering had involved it in a sort of mystery if tom sawder
had not been there he wtould have proposed to go on shore and bring the
matter to a positive result

    if there was a man there he was concealing himself perhaps he was a
fugitive from justice an escaped convict or a defaulter keeping himself out
of sight andy was so much interested in the subject that he was tempted
to risk another battle with the chief of the hoodlums in order to find out
the bunkel mystery



    i think you may as well give it up andy said di when she saw by
his conduct that he was still vexing his spirit with the unsolved problem

     i dont see that i am likely to make myself any wiser on the subject
and i shall have to give it up he replied  but another puzzle has just
come up in my mind why was tom sawder taking those boards to bunkel
island   

     i give it up replied di laughing heartily at the spirit of investigation
her companion was developing

    when you picked him up he was not willing to abandon the raft  and
he was going to make me help him get the boards on shore what is he
going to do with them  continued andy so much absorbed in the inquiry
that he did not heed the laugh of the fair skipper

      i supposed he was only using the boards as a raft  

     in that case lie would not have taken the trouble to get them to bunkel
for i have no doubt lie stole them argued andy

    but di felt little or  interest in the question which called forth so much
activity  the part of her companion and he said no more though he did
not cease to think of it by the advice of andy the sloop had gone down
through the strait and was coming up through the channel as the narrow
and the wide passage were respectively called by the few boatmen on the
lake for there were not more than half a dozen boats of all kinds on the
beautiful sheet of water

    the diana had just come up with the most southerly point of the island
and andy was  the lookout for the landing rock hoping the mysterious
man would again show himself the long tack in the course had brought
the sloop close to this cape she had come about and her course was quite near
the rocky shore and almost parallel with it in a moment more the boat
would be in position to enable the inquirer to see the landing rock

     hi  hi  hi   shouted bob rottle at the tiller lines of the hood-
lum boat and this seemed to be his peculiar war cr

   tom sawder had been on the watch for the diana  and the row boat had
been out far enough to enable him to see the sloop standing across the
channel as soon as he got sight of her he had ordered his lieutenant to
back the boat behind the point the chief of the hoodlums believed that he
was a profound strategist as well as the hardest hitter in that latitude

   he was sure that andy would keep out of his way if he discovered the
row boat in season to do so and he had concealed his gang behind the point
ready to pounce upon his victim as soon as the sloop came near enough to
enable him to do so when the end of the dianas bowsprit appeared beyond
the rocks tom had given the order to pull to the two rowers at this criti-
cal moment the sloop was not more than fifty feet from the point

     ah ha  ah ha   yelled josh boole

    yah  yah  yah  cried buck fishier for each had his own war

cry

     now sliet up fellers and let me do the talkin   interposed the chief
as he stood up in tliarbow of the boat with one of the revolvers in his hand

     punch him with a shot tom   yelled bob rottle


the bunkel mystery

    shet up bob or ill punch you said tom turning to look at the
disobedient lieutenant  i want to speak to him and you make such a
racket a feller cant hear hisself think

    all right push it through tom replied bob subsiding

    ive got you now andy lamb and i guess well finish up   shouted
the chief  stop that boat quickern lightnin  

     what shall we do andy    asked di singerlay when she saw how near
the ruffian was to her

    put the helm up and let off the sheets replied andy quietly and
without moving from his seat

   this change of course would not only give the sloop a free wind so that
she could sail faster than when close hauled but it took the diana away from
the enemy in front di was frightened but she did not lose-her head and
effected the change of course in a single instant the boat felt the change
and darted off at a livelier speed towards the east shore of the lake

   stop that boat dont you hear me andy lamb demanded tom
when the sloop began to fall off  but as he was no boatman he did not know
what the alteration in the course meant

    i hear you  im not deaf replied andy apparently not at all disturbed
by the demonstration of the hoodlums for he was a thorough boatman and
had perfect confidence in the diana-in both dianas for that matter for he
had been astonished at the skill of the young lady at the helm

   though circumstances beyond his control had placed andy in the
barkpool party he was not prejudiced against the fair skipper on this account
she had been to the high school with him but he had known her only as a
schoolmate and had hardly ever even spoken to her or she to him but she
was a skilful boatwoman and that was enough to excite his admiration even
more than her pretty face

    stop that boat i say   yelled tom again more fiercely than before

    i know you say it answered andy with something of derision in his
tones for the expression was so clumsy and unnautical that he was disgusted
with it apart from its meaning

    stop that boat  if you dont mind what i say to you ill blow your
brains out with my revolver   shouted tom as he flourished the weapon in
the air

    blow away   replied andy still unmoved

    but he has a pistol  i am frightened and- added di

   there was quite a roomy cuddy under the half deck and andy suggested
that she should retire to this safe place she did so

chapter v-the battle with -the hoodlums

   the cuddy of the diana had a woolen carpet and was not encumbered
with old rigging or with anything else on each side was a seat quite low
still a full grown person could find head room enough di was as courageous
as the average young lady but in an encounter in which firearms were to be
used she believed that absence of body was better than presence of mind
the bunkel mystery



       i think you had better lie down on the floor miss singerlay for a ball
  from the revolver might go through the side of the boat though i dont think
  there is much danger of it said andy when the fair skipper had seated her-
  self in the cuddy

      	if there isnt any danger i dont want to run away added di trying
  to smile but it was hard work

       there is danger and i think you had better lie down  but not much
  danger for the villain is too far off to hit us  

      di yielded to this argument and reclined on the floor so that her body was
   below the water line of the sloop she placed her head near the door and her
   position was comfortable enough

       but what are you going to do andy   asked di thinking for the first
  time of the safety of her plucky companion

       i am going to sail the boat miss singerlay replied lfe with a cheerful
   smile

     but the wretch will hit you with his revolver suggested di who
  appeared to be really concerned about him

       i dont think there is much danger of his hitting anything smaller than
  bunkel island  but if i find i am likely to be shot i am not too proud to duck
  my head below the top of the washboard so that he cant see me replied
  audy laughing  i cant imagine where the rascal got the revolver to say
  nothing of a second one i see in his belt  and i am sure he can have had 
  practice with the weapon

       are you gou to stop that boat   yelled tom before the present skip-
  per had made all the arrangements described

      she wont stop thomas  she dont know how to do such a thing
  returned andy

       i tell you im goiu to shoot if you dont stop   cried tom who could
  not help seeing that the diana was getting away from him

       shoot awtay   replied andy as he slid off his seat and gathered him-
  self up on the floor of the standing room

      in this position he could see over the top of the washboard by raising his
  head while he easily retained his hold on the tiller the two hoodlums were
  pulling with all their might  but they were not skilled in the use of oars
  besides being much excited by the savage threats of their great leader and
  they did their work very badly

       i aint foolin and if you dont stop ill put a bullet through jour soft
a head yelled tom again he was evidently disgusted with the weak im-
pression produced by his pistol

       put it through   called andy as he looked over the washboard

      the hoodlum had exhausted his patience in his efforts to induce andy to
  be alarmed and raising his weapon he fired it the skipper of the diana did
  not scorn to duck his head and the report followed his movement

       none of that   shouted a voice the owner of which did not appear to
  be on the stage of action

     andy heard the words very distinctly though as his head was down
  he failed to note the direction from which the sound came the remark
s

the bunkel mystery

struck his ear just as though it had been uttered by some one in a passing
cloud that was scudding over the lake

    did you hear that miss singerlay  asked andy turning his head to
the door of the cuddy

     i did not hear anything but the report of the pistol replied di  did
you get hit andy

   hit no he could not have hit me at this distance even if he had
seen my head but some one shouted none of that replied andy
looking over the washboard

     who could have said it   asked di interested in the fact

      the voice sounded as though it came out of a cloud  but of course it
did not returned andy  ah ha  i begin to see through this business a
little

    	 what do you see   

     i see tom looking at the island and that is where the voice came from
i am sure now that there is a man on the island   added the skipper not a
little excited to find that his problem had solved itself  i dont know any-
thing about the man but he must have lent those two revolvers to that
ruffian  yet he did not mean that he should use them or he would not have
spoken

   but tom sawder had a will and a way of his own though he had
doubtless supposed that a display of the weapons would be sufficient to
frighten his intended victim into submission he was so mad at their failure to
do so that he could not resist the temptation to discharge the one in his hand
he was not satisfied with one shot and he fired another when he lowered
the weapon andy raised his head and probably his assailant did not know
that he had   ducked   at the shot

     aint you gon to stop that boat and dauib   demanded tom

     she dont know how to stop when another boat is after her replied the
skipper

   if you dont stop youll get killed  yelled tom more fiercely than
ever

    if i do get killed ill let you know replied andy ducking his head
again when he saw the bloodthirsty hoodlum raise the weapon a second time

   the rascal fired four shots without intermission which exhausted the
barrels of one of his revolvers andy raised his head again he saw that
tom was boiling over with wrath if he took aim at all he did not even hit
the boat andy listened for another warning from the man on the island
but he heard none

   i hope you are not hurt andy said di in trembling tones for the
fusillade had produced its impression on her if it had not on him

     not at all  he did not even hit the mainsail dont be a bit frightened
miss singerlay i am sure he cant hit us at this distance you are in
no more danger where you are than you would be in your own fathers
house replied andy as he glanced at the pugnacious hoodlum

   tom had taken the other revolver from his belt when he aimed it at the
boat the skipper ducked again shot after shot followed in quick succession
the bunkel mystery



as the skipper cornteel the reports one ball went through the washboard
just forward of andys head a foot further aft would have sent the ball
through his head after it had penetrated the board

   andy sprang to his feet he glanced at the hole through the washboard
it made him boil over with indignation and anger the keg of gunpowder
in his composition exploded as he looked at it possibly he had not been
able to believe that the threats of the hoodlum were anything more than talk
till the boat was struck by a shot toms actions meant  business  to him
now

   without saying a word to the fair skipper he put the boat about and
headed her towards the craft of the hoodlums andy was mad from the sole
of his shoe to the lining of his cap the blackguard had come within one
foot of putting a bullet through his head

   the diana had been headed to the southeast during toms revolver prac-
tice and of course was now in the opposite direction and she had the wind
square on the beam she was doing her best as she had not before because
the skippers attention had been diverted from his duty

    did he hit you andy asked di as soon as the skipper resumed his
place at the tiller after he had changed the course of the sloop   i know he
has for you have been changing the course of the boat  

    no he did not hit me  but he came within just one foot of sending a
bullet through my head answered andy much excited you can see
where the ball struck the washboard   and he pointed at the ragged hole

    but he will kill you andy   almost screamed di as she looked at the
mark of the ball

    no he wont  he has emptied all his barrels and he cant fire again till
he loads them there is not a bit of danger to you now miss singerlay and
you had better come out of the cuddy said andy struggling to keep his
wrath within bounds

   his anger and indignation did not manifest themselves in outward expres-
sions  all the boiling was within his being though it gave a decided sharp-
ness to his actions di seemed to have unlimited confidence in her compan-
ion for she came out of the cuddy and seated herself in the standing room

     why andy  you are headed directly towards the rascals boat    she
exclaimed as soon as she had looked about her

    i am  i cant stand this thing any longer and im going to put a stop
to it in short meter replied he with his teeth set

   the diana was going at a furious rate  tom sawder was yelling a
minute later the sloop struck the row boat and cut it in twro

  chapter vi-the mysterious stranger on bunkel island

   di singerlay sent forth a scream when the sloop struck the row boat
a young lady could hardly have been expected to do less than this for it was
really a terrible scene the diana actually went entirely over the craft and
her living freight carrying the four hoodlums under water

   andy lamb was thoroughly in earnest he had varied the course of the
o

the bunkel mystery

sloop enough to enable him to hit the boat amidships and as it was only
lightly tmilt the sharp bow of the sailboat had cut entirely through her

   the two ruffians who were at the oars had only time to abandon their
posts and one of them sprang into the bow while the other tumbled into the
stern sheets tom sawder who was yelling out his threats of vengeance
as though he did not anticipate the impending disaster was pitched from his
standing position over the bow of the boat

    the diana was strongly built and she dashed on her course only a little
shaken by the shock as though nothing had happened of course tom and
his companions were effectively silenced and it was a relief to hear their
noisy yells no more andy stood as stiff as a granite monument at the helm
and did not seem to be at all disturbed by the mischief he had done to the
enemy he looked calmly astern at the havoc he had made and did not
change the course of the sloop

    the row boat contained no ballast and it did not sink what was left of
it remained floating on the waves after the diana had passed over it none
of the hoodlums had been injured by the collision and all four of them were
in condition to take care of themselves

   all but tom were in the boat and they laid hold of the wreck the
rower who had leaped into the stern gave his hand to the chief and drew him
to the boat so that he got hold of it not one of them was in anj danger

   the wind had been increasing and the lake now was lively with white
caps although the boat had been practically cut in two the parts did not
separate and it was evident that they were held together by the keel which
had not been broken

    as soon as andy had satisfied himself that the ruffians were in no danger
of perishing in the lake he directed his attention to the shore of the island
he expected to see there the mysterious individual who had called out to
tom and who had probably supplied him with his stock of revolvers

   but there was no one to be seen on the island there was certainly a
man there and as he had observed the actions of tom when he had the pistol
in his hand he must have seen the disaster to the boat andy ran directly
for the landing rock and watched with all his eyes for the appearance of the
stranger the skipper was so much absorbed in this lookout that he failed to
make any reply to the remarks of his fair companion

   the mysterious man did not appear and perhaps the proximity of the
sloop was a sufficient excuse for his failure to do so for it was plain enough
that he intended to conceal himself andy wondered that he had been so
imprudent as to call out to tom when he raised the revolver  but probablj
he believed he could not be heard on board of the diana

    even the wreck of the boat did not prove to be a sufficient inducement to
the stranger to betray his presence and andy concluded that he had some
very strong motive for concealment this conclusion made the matter all the
more serious and important to him and he was therefore all the more anxious
to solve the mystery which surrounded the stranger but he could do noth-
ing while his movements were hampered by the presence of the fair skipper
and for the present he had to abandon the inquiry
the bunkel mystery	r

    when the diana was within a short distance of the landing andy came
about and braced the sails sharp up heading her as nearly as the wind would
permit for montoban for it looked as though he had no further business in
the vicinity of the island the course took the sloop within a short distance
of the boat to which the ruffians were clinging

     i didnt know you were going to run into that boat andy said di
when the skipper looked at her for the first time in five minutes this was
the third time she had made the same remark

     you must excuse me for not answering you before replied andy with
a smile to show that he had no ill will  i was on the lookout for that man
on the island and i wanted to hear as well as see and i was afraid i might
lose some sound that would help me to a better understanding of the
situation  

      i was sorry i said anything when i saw that you were busy thinking
and listening added di  you must excuse me for talking when i ought
to have kept still andy  

     it is all right then for i did not mean to offend you

   you did not offend me-what an idea exclaimed she i was
excited and frightened when the sloop crashed into the boat and was silly
enough to scream but i got over it in a moment i did not expect such an
ending to the battle

     i did not tell you what i was going to do i confess because i was afraid
you would tell me not to do it andy explained

    if you had told me i should not have screamed  but it was so unexpected
that i couldnt help it

     the scream did no harm laughed andy

      it did not occur to me that you could do such a thing  

     then i ought to explain my conduct and ask to be forgiven

    i am glad you punished the wretches as they deserved and there is
nothing to forgive andy

     perhaps i have got myself into a bad scrape by what i have done but i
cant help it now  and i should do it over again under the same circum-
stances added the skipper looking more serious than he had before

     never mind the scrape  my father will pay for the boat if there is any
trouble about it

     it was not so much to punish those villains that i ran into them as it
was to save you first and myself afterwards from harm if not death said
andj very seriously

     from death   exclaimed di with a terrified look

    look at the washboard  you see that hole  if your head or mine had
been there it would have been death wouldnt it  continued he pointing
at the bullet hole

    it could hardly have been otherwise she answered with a shudder

    you know i asked you to come out of the cuddy after tom had stopped
firing he had fired off all the charges contained in two revolvers and i
knew tuat he could not fire again till he reloaded them i did not mean to
give him time to do this  


the bunkel mystery

     did he load them again   

    i dont know  i dont think he did  but i am sure he would have done
so if the diana had not come about and thus distracted his attention  that
is provided he had any more cartridges  

    did he have any more 

   you will have to ask him miss singerlay for i dont know replied
andy with a smile

    of course you dont know  what a foolish question   laughed di
 if he had any you did not give him a chance to use them

    that is just the point and i did not mean to have him shooting at a
boat with a young lady in it 

    you did just right andy and i am sure my father will stand by you to
the end added di warmly

    you forget that i am on the other side of the house miss singerlay
said andy with a smile for he felt that he was touching upon delicate
matters

    you forget that you were on the other side of the house when that
wretch took my boat away from me and i shall do my best to make my
father forget it also at any rate i shall forget it-for all time and di
blushed again

   an hour later di was landed in front of her fathers house

chapter vii-the rival magnates of montoban

   montoban was at the head of the lake of the same name it was a
flourishing town almost large enough to be a city  indeed it has risen to this
distinction since the events related in this story flowing into the lake on
the eastern border of the town was the ouongo river overlooking the mouth
of which was the magnificent residence of mr percival singerlay

   just above the town the river had been a rushing stream running through
a verj wild and picturesque region  and at a distance of something over half
a mile from the lake it was still a rushing stream when there was water
enough to swell its current but there were two dams within half a mile of
the lake which had raised the water and made ponds in the bed of the
stream

   mr percival singerlay and mr phineas barkpool had formerly been
partners in a very profitable manufacturing business which had made them
millionaires in the estimation of other people though their property was so
scattered and of such divers sorts that neither of them could have told
whether he was worth a million or only half that princely figure at any
rate they were both rich men and that is enough

   they had been really the fathers of montoban and the region about it for
they were public spirited men and had done their best to develop the resources
of the locality their enterprise had stimulated others to action and the
place had doubled tripled and quadrupled its population

   in the day of small things they had purchased the land on both sides of
the river for half a mile and controlled it wisely in the interests of the
the bunkel mystery

prosperity of the town but au evil day came  at least the people thought
at the time that it was an evil day for the two magnates of montobau quar-
reled over their business interests it proved to be a very bitter feud and
each accused the other of cheating and robbing him

   they dissolved partnership but they could not agree on the division of
the common property referees divided it for them they drew a line
across the onongo river and gave mr singerlay all the land below it with
the manufactory and all the land above it to mr barkpool the latter was
compensated in cash for the great difference in the value of the moieties

   mr singerlay rubbed his hands and believed that he had obtained by far
the larger half so thought almost everybody else and wondered that mr
barkpool did not protest against the decision fully satisfied that he had a
remarkably good case

   but mr barkpool did not protest and even seemed to be pleased with the
division inequitable as it appeared to be to everybody else the fact came
out afterwards that lie had contrived to have it known to the referees that he
would be willing to take the up-river division of the land  and this knowledge
had greatly lightened the labors of the arbitrators the business was settled
up with all possible haste and the money award paid to mr barkpool

   less than a quarter of a mile from the lake was the dam which furnished
the power for the immense factory of which mr singerlay was now the sole
owner his residence faced the river just below the rapids at the foot of the
dam the manufacturer believed he was the sole magnate of montobau
and he was accordingly happy in the belief

   within three days after mr barkpool had deposited his late partners
check for differences in values a hundred men were at work building a dam a
half mile above the old one as many more were laying the foundation of a
mill more extensive than that of montoban called the onongo by the time
the dam was built and the mill was finished the machinery was ready to go
into it

   a whole village of boarding houses and other buildings was erected almost
in the twinkling of an eye and a mansion far surpassing that of the other
magnate rose into being in the most beautiful location on the south shore of
the lake to be occupied by the owner of the new mill in due time all the
buildings were completed and everything was in running order families
whose members were in want of work took the houses and the boarding es-
tablishments had all they could accommodate the mill was in operation
and turning out more goods than the old one

   just at this point there was no rain to speak of for two months and the
river was almost dry the onongo mill had to shut down for the want of
power  but so did the montoban mr barkpool did not wait a day but put
in steam  and before his rival knew what he was about the onongo was at
work again mr singerlay followed the example of his late partner but it
took time and his opponent had the market for some weeks

   mr barkpool immediately built a reservoir on his own land where he
stored up the waste water against another dry time for coal was expensive
in the absence of proper facilities of transportation a branch railroad was


the bunkel mystery

planned  mr singerlay fought to have it run as far as possible from the rival
mill and mr barkpool to get it as near as possible each defeated the other
and no road was built

   mr singerlay was president of the montoban bank and as mr barkpool
thought he was not fairly treated in the matter of the discounts the onongo
bank was started the onongo hotel was built by the up-river magnate
and the patronage of the montoban hotel was reduced for a time the
names of the two mills were applied to halls saloons stores omnibuses
boats and engines

   the town was divided into two factions and there was constant war
between them society was divided between the two mills and even the
churches shared in the rivalry but again montoban doubled tripled and
quadrupled its population for competition is the life of trade the business
done by the mills had been more than doubled and new enterprises were still
the order of the day

   di singerlay as has been said landed in front of her fathers house
andy lamb put the diana in good condition and after the fair skipper had
thanked him again with a blushing face for the service he had rendered her
he started for his home which was in the onongo domain

   he had to go through the grounds of the montoban magnate where he
had never been before and he did not know the way out the estate wtas
very extensive and he followed a road after he had parted with the daughter
of the house which he thought would lead him to the street in front of the
mansion

   he had gone far enough to see the dome on the town hall when he heard
footsteps attended with angry talk the speakers were directly ahead of
him and he recognized their voices which were those of mr singerlay and
his son dolph as he was called though his name in full was adolphus-too
long for common use

   andy lamb did not care to meet the father of the fair skipper before she
had told him her story  and especially not when he was in an angry mood
as at the present time for he had the reputation of being a very violent and
unreasonable man when he was excited after looking about him for the
best means to effect his retreat he discovered near him a norway pine with
branches reaching down to the green sod

   behind it and close to the driveway was a rustic seat andy had no
time to spare for the voices were very near and he dodged behind the pine
the magnate and his son appeared to be having a very rough time of it and
the sixteen year old boy was not particularly respectful to his sire

   your boat is good enough and you dont need another said mr
singerlay dont say another word about it i wont give you the
money  and that is the end of it

   the dragon is good enough for a sailboat but i waul a steamer re-
plied dolph in a dogged tone

   andy thought she was good enough for she was equal to anything on the
hudson where he had learned the art of the boatman  and he decided that
dolph was a very unreasonable fellow
an idyl



    a steamer   exclaimed mr singerlay furiously  do you want to get
blown up you dont know any more about handling a steamer than you
did when you were a month old dolph your mother would be frightened
out of her wits if you had such a plaything

    i dont mean to handle the engine myself ive been through the high
school and i know something about steam 

    mighty little   exclaimed the magnate for dolph had not been a very
promising scholar  you cant get an engineer for there is not one in the
lower town 

    but i think i can get morgan lambs son  and he knows how to run an
engine replied dolph

    morgan lambs son  do you think i would trust my son in the hands
of one of barkpools satellites demanded the magnate with intense indig-
nation to hear his son propose to harbor one of the faction from his rivals
district

    andy lamb is a good fellow added dolph

    thank you thought andy  di -will say as much as that for me

   just at that moment the intelligent son of morgan lamb who was com-
petent to run a steam engine sneezed violently in spite of the effort to sup-
press the impulse it was a tremendous unconditional sneeze and mr
singerlay rushed behind the tree the moment he saw andy he sprang
upon him took him by the collar and dragged him very roughly into the
house

penny scheme of three adventurers was transformed into an extraordinary
contribution to the world of science-scenes and incidents
of a sojourn on the earths satellite

synopsis of chapters previously published

    messrs gryphins vogel and wagner three adventurers in melbourne australia start
the lunar company for the conquest and exploration of the mineral riches of the moon
 but how are we to get to the moon   is the question asked by large numbers of stockholders
and at a public meeting wagner talks learnedly of a tubular tunnel but has his theory utterly
demolished by norbert mauny a young frenchman who declares that in order to complete such
a piece of work within the stipulated time of five years it must rise at the rate of  miles a
year 

   the assemblage is panic stricken and the stockholders demand their money back when
mauny calls for order and announces that he has a plan to propose-that of attracting the
moon to the earth by erecting a series of powerful magnets the idea is received with
enthusiasm and mauny is voted manager of the company the bayouda desert in the soudan
is selected as the site for the erection of the magnets the expedition sets out at suakim
mauny meets the french consul m kersain and his daughter gertrude who decide to ac-
company him on a visit to the mogaddem of rhadameh a local ruler whose favor must be
obtained before the transportation of the material across the desert can be made

    this mogaddem is a weird sort of personage and possesses a hideously ugly dwarf after
promising to pay certain large sums as tribute norbert secures the cooperation he desires and
soon after the return to the seaport the expedition sets out for the bayouda desert here the
observatories reflectors etc are erected on the peak of tehbali and work proceeds with grati-
fying success till messrs gryphins vogel and wagner are detected in a conspiracy to turn the
workmen against norbert they are imprisoned and a guard placed over them and then
norbert hearing that trouble threatens khartoum where m kersain has been transferred
determines to go thither and see if he cannot induce him and his daughter to take refuge at the
peak

    the consul refuses to leave his post but it is finally arrarlged that gertrude accompanied by
dr briet her uncle and fatima her maid set out with norbert for tehbali o the road they meet
a woman fig seller and shortly after eating some of her fruit a deep sleep falls on all members
of the part on awaking gertrude discovers that she is in a strange but beautiful apartment
with only fatima who sleeps near her but presently the hideous dwarf cf the mogaddem of
the rhadameh presents himself and offers his hand in marriage

n hearing the dwarfs strange words gertrude kersain was dumb with

 astonishment as she made  answer the hideous creature continued
with a sneer 

   i a slave  is it possible that appearances have thus deceived thee

the mahdi and many others though they are far from suspecting it i am the
master of the soudan pending the time when i shall be master of africa and of
the whole world i am modest when i speak of offering thee but one throne 
for i can place ten or twenty or a hundred at thy feet if thou wilt say but
the word and the whole universe shall do homage to thee like myself a
moment ago  i am kaddour the all powerful magician rejoice child for
i have chosen thee to share my glory and my power  

    enough   exclaimed gertrude haughtily  vile slave thinkest thou
that thy bragging can inspire aught but disdain 

   the dwarf was not disconcerted

     again that word slave   he cried   i have already told thee that i
am master here and everywhere canst thou not believe it  if my black
skin caused thee to class me among a despised race i can change my color 
see  

   to the amazement of gertrude and eatima the dwarf transformed him-
self under their eyes his skin first paled then became gray greenish
yellow in turns  his features contorted convulsively and he came forth from
the struggle hideous as ever-but white 

   fatima gave a terrified scream and fell prostrate gertrude felt her own
heart palpitate rapidly but not for worlds would she have sliowrn alarm

   think not to frighten me by this juggling she said  white or
black to me thou art naught but a charlatan if it is thou who hast brought
me hither release me as quickly as possible thou wilt gain nothing by
delay and thy ridiculous venture will be forgiven only on condition of my
immediate freedom bethink thee that i belong to a powerful nation that
knows how to piotect the honor of its children   

    speak not to me of thy nation   thundered the dwarf  i have said
and i repeat that my power is limitless  the acts of nations and the very
counsels of kings did they but know it depend on me i am he who holds
the invisible threads of destiny throughout the world men are but puppets
in my hands thou dost not believe me  thou needest proofs  thou slialt
have them   

   he beat his enormous hands and suddenly one of the alcoves opened and
formed into a stage scene with the difference that instead of side wings of
wood and canvas there appeared a long gallery lighted by silver torches and
filled with marble statues colonnades and rich decorations on a raised
platform in the middle of the gallery stood a golden throne and a numerous
court surrounded it bowing respectfully as if it were occupied instead of
standing empty

   every type of humanity and variety of costume were represented there
were narrow eyed chinese japanese in their lacquer armor indians arabs
wrapped in white burnouses canadians in furred coats zulus with their asse-
gias boers with rifles tattooed fijians and a hundred others

   when the crowd had defiled before the throne and had taken their places
down the sides of the gallery the aforesaid gigantic negro who had an-
nounced the entry of kaddour now stepped to the foreground as if awaiting
the orders of his master


a month in the moon

    call the envoy of canada said the latter

   an american half breed clothed from head to foot in beaver skins
stepped forward bowed profoundly before kaddour and said in french 

     master riel waits but thy orders to instigate his manitoban brethren
against england  

    the envoy of the boers   cried kaddour

   a rude sunburnt peasant slouched heavily forward pulled a sealed letter
out of his cap and handed it to the negro saying in dutch 

    the boers of the cape send greeting to kaddour and will revolt when
he gives the signal

   the dwarf translated all this to gertrude  then he resumed 

    let india advance  

a young maiden in the costume of a nautcli girl came forward wrapped
in a silver spangled gauze veil and spoke as follows in a clear musical voice 
 india seems to slumber but she is waiting two hundred millions are
at the service of the all powerful kaddour to strike for freedom and
vengeance  

     is my daughter of green erin present    asked the dwarf

   a fair skinned irish woman dressed in deep mourning responded 

   the invincibles are ready to blow up london should the master think
that will advance the cause  

    now the son of the mahdi   shouted the dwarf

    kaddour is great and the mahdi is his prophet said the young arab
instantly

      enough    replied kaddour   disappear  

   the alcove closed suddenly and the vision vanished

    thou seest who i am   he said turning to gertrude

   crossing his long arms on his misshapen chest he gave her a look of
irony which she returned with interest

   i see she answered that thou hast clever actors who know their
parts well   

   actors is it thus thou termest all these agents of my power whom
thou hast just seen  they are not actors child unknown to each other
divided in race in interests in animosities i alone govern them i alone
can inflame their anger were i to say but a word the world might be in
ruins tomorrow and i alone reigning in the light of day as now i reign
supreme in the darkness  mauny thought to conceal his plans from me i
knew them in detail the moment they were arranged thou thyself were
starting for tehbali and see  thou art here   

   yes thanks to some shameful treachery cried gertrude it
matters not dwarf  i do not believe in thy boasted power

     thou dost not believe it even now  what then would convince thee 
wouldst thou see what brave gordon is this moment writing to his
government  

   once more the dwarf beat his hands another alcove similar to the first
opened disclosing not a sumptuous gallery but a plain telegraph office
the wires lay on a table and were all numbered and attached to the machine
a month in the moon	

o a level with the latter were ivory plates bearing the inscriptions paris
london rome constantinople st petersburg new york pekin calcutta
quebec etc

    i have turned the khartoum wire aside said the dwarf laughing
 and gordons despatches must pass here on their way to cairo read this
if thou art interested

   gertrude remained motionless

     i will read it to thee continued kaddour

    general gordon to sir evelyn baring agent-general of her brittannic majesty
at cairo

we shall be blockaded in less than three days

                    signed	gordon

     i shall send qh the despatch said the dwarf with a sneer  but i shall
alter it somewhat by stating that no army of support is needed what sayest
thou child  nowdost thou believe in  power  

      i believe in thy treachery   

chapter xviii-the dwarfs power

   the dwarf grew pale with rage for a few minutes he remained in a
gloomy reverie then turning to gertrude he said with a long drawn sigh

   how can i manage to convince thee foolish girl  art thou then
impervious to fear thou art not content with what thou hast seen already
perhaps thou desirest proofs of my supernatural power  thou slialt have
them wouldst thou at this moment behold him of whom thou art
thinking  

    he blew a shrill blast on the silver whistle hanging to his sash instantly
a third alcove opened like the others and behind a screen formed of a large
sheet of crystal there arose a slight cloud like mist this gradually con-
densed and took at length a human shape gertrude recognized her father

   he was seated in his office in the french consulate at khartoum and
attentively studying a report that lay before him on a sudden he leaned
back in his arm chair then he opened a drawer in his desk and took out a
portrait that gertrude tearfully recognized as her own

    the consul kissed it long and tenderly tears must have filled his eyes
for gertrude saw him wipe them away and her own flowed so freely at the
sight that she could no longer distinguish anything little by little the
vision faded away

     that is the present said the dwarf  and now behold the future

    on the crystal screen where but a moment before the image of her beloved
father had rested gertrude now beheld a circular form that gradually took
distinct shape she knew it for the grand square at khartoum with the
government house on one side the french consulate  the other

    it was apparently the dawn of day  people of every age and condition wrere
	a month in the moon

running across the empty square they wore a haggard terror stricken
aspect all at once an officer issued from the government house followed
by four or five men he was short in statue fair haired and blue eyed and
he descended the steps with great rapidity anger gleamed from his coun-
tenance as he turned round gertrude saw that it was general gordon

   at the same instant a band of ragged arabs burst into the square as
soon as they perceived the little group coming towards them they stood still
and fired a volley from their rides the general fell his escort fled whilst
the insurgents ran to him  and with a shudder of horror gertrude saw them
hold up the bleeding head of gordon

   averting her eyes from this terrible sight she glanced at the consulate
and thought she saw her father coming forth alone an agony of apprehen-
sion came over her afresh and to her loving filial heart a yet more horrible
catastrophe was about to be shown her  and meanwhile as she gazed the
vision clouded over and -disappeared

   for a few minutes gertrude was too shocked to speak  but soon regaining
command over herself she said coldly

     the future does not belong to thee what thou hast shown me is only
an evil dream gordon will not fall by thy means but he will hang every
one of you

    thou darest to speak thus to me cried the dwarf grinding his teeth
 ah  thou fearest nothing well then behold 

   whilst saying these words he held up both arms

   at once a hideous din arose seeming as if it would reud the very bowels
of the earth the carved monsters who upheld the doors and cornices sud-
denly came to life and filled the chamber with their howling the paintings
on the walls appeared to stand out apart with strange gestures  gods with heads
of dogs cats jackals and birds strange beasts and monstrous crocodiles ad-
vanced towards the girl turning their bloodshot eyes on her

   nearly mad with terror fatima rushed shrieking into the arms of her mis-
tress

   stop the menagerie said gertrude disdainfully to the dwarf if
thou art trying to frighten me i warn thee that it is a waste of time

   kaddour muttered a few words in an unknown tongue at once the
monsters resumed their places gertrude shrugged her shoulders but the
dwarf fixed his flaming eyes on fatima and made a sign the young
servant leaving her mistress went toward him her eyes were wide open
but their look was as it were turned inward

    fatima said the magician in a sepulchral tone  thou lovest thy mis-
tress i know she believes in thy affection and cherishes thee as a sister
but i say to thee take this poinard out of my sash and plunge it in her
heart   

   fatima gave a deep sigh  two big tears hung on her eyelashes and rolled
down her cheeks nevertheless she stood before the dwarf took the poinard
from his sash and turned toward gertrude with uplifted arm ready to
strike

      hold    said the dwarf
a month in the moon

i

    slie stood still as if turned to stone her arm fixed in its attitude

    as to gertrude she could scarce restrain her tears

    poor child she murmured trying gently to lower the rigid arm of her
little maid   do not be afraid lest i might blame thee i know this is nothing
but hypnotism and such witchcraft cannot shake my faith in thy fidelity

     at least it proves my power to thee    said kaddour making a sign
which restored fa tima to consciousness she came out of her cataleptic sleep
all trembling and at once ran to her mistress like a frightened fawn

    hearken to me continued the dwarf thou art a woman it is
impossible that thou sliouldst not be attracted by the prospect of power
unique absolute and illimitable thou knowest that riches are absolutely at
my disposal for there are no treasures inaccessible to a power like mine
thou canst not doubt that any secret is unknown to me neither the visible
nor the invisible has any mystery for me i know everything  i can do
everything at my service are the resources of ancient and modern science
the traditions of all the magicians black and white european and asiatic
and i ask thee wilt thou share this unexampled power with me wilt thou
be crowned queen of africa empress of india of china of the world  if
this does not please thee it needs but a sign from thee and i remain in the
shade all powerful but hidden as i have been until this day and thou shalt
reign with me without the source of thy power being suspected

    perhaps the situation had its tragic side but gertrude was so irresistibly
struck with its comicality that she burst out laughing

   unhappy being he howled thou shalt not laugh long i swear
the earth shall suffer for what thou hast done  wert thou to live a hundred
years thou wouldst not have time enough to repent insulting kaddour  

   he went away in a rage the door had scarcely closed behind him when
gertrude and fatima heard heavy bolts and chains clanking against their
prison walls

   an hour went by in peace at the end of that time the door opened once
more and an exclamation of joy broke from both as they saw norbert mauny
standing on the threshold

   gertrude mile kersain   cried the young astronomer i never
expected the happiness of finding you in this mysterious prison  will you
ever forgive me for having brought you here   

    forgive you   said gertrude  what are you talking about are you
nt also a prisoner  i am only too thankful to see you again  do you
know what has become of dr briet and mabrouki   

     i have not set ejes  them since we ate those unlucky figs that doubt-
less contained some subtle narcotic  

   it is for you rather gertrude continued  to reproach me for your
captivity for had it not been for me you would never have been here   

     if onl i could prove my devotion to you more clearly   cried norbert
 we must certaiuljr get out of this but how in the world are we to ascer-
tain where we are and in -whose custody  

    do you not know  the dwarf of rliadameh is our jailer  and not an
hour ago he offered me his hand  


a month in the moon

    insolent myrmidon  

     i laughed in his face as you may imagine and he went off in a towering
rage threatening me with vengeance

     the point is said norbert looking round  what he can do and what
lie intends to do this dungeon of yours is rather different from mine

    he had not ceased speaking when a panel slid aside in the wall and the
dwarf of rhadameh stood before them at the head of two or three hundred
black men norbert noted as passing strange that this troop was exactly
similar in every particular to his own negro guard the men were of the
same type equipped alike with tiger skin shields and the same kind of hel-
mets and lances

      i will show you what i will do and what i can do   said kaddour
echoing the last words of the young astronomer  i will that this young
girl become my wife and i can do a great deal to oblige her to consent for
instance i can subject thee to torture i can take thee to tehbali i can
under your very eyes destroy stone by stone all the works of your ambitious
vanity we shall see then if thou wilt not be the first to ask her to accept
my offer  

     gertrude  cried norbert do not yield out of pity forme i pray
you  it would indeed be maddening to witness the destruction by this
wretch of the works that have cost me so much time and trouble but that
you should marry him would be the very bitterest grief to me of all

     nothing is farther from my thoughts said gertrude calmly   and if
anything should increase my horror for the monster it would be the means he
has chosen whereby to shake my resolution   

   kaddour grew white with- fury

   bring cords he cried and bind this fine gentleman we will
begin by going to tehbali it is time that i tried my hand there too 
all the more so that i have a bone to pick with others there besides norbert
mauny 

chapter xix-the sons of the lake

   sir bucephalus had not long been awake and was taking his usual
morning constitutional round the plateau of tehbali when virgil came to
him saying 

     i have just had pointed out to me sir a troop of armed men in the dis-
tance who seem to be coming this way i had stringent orders that no one
was to be allowed to visit the works without a pass i think it will be well
to arm the negro guard and go and meet this suspicious looking troop

     very well replied the baronet with supreme indifference

   the baronet resumed his constitutional for an hour precisely watch in
hand and then seating himself in a caned chair he buried his head in the
european newspapers-they were brought him every morning by a special
messenger from berber

     gordon named governor general of the soudan    he exclaimed a
minute after reached khartoum having crossed the desert alone on a
a month in the moon



camel  just like him   murmured sir bucephalus as he hurriedly glanced
over the times that no doubt is the explanation of maunys delay at
khartoum  

   meanwhile virgil had armed the negro guard and marshaling them in
double file had taken the lead down the road in twenty minutes his hun-
dred warriors agile as panthers were in the plain beyond the village and
stood in battle array against the newcomers at the range of about two gun-
shots from the first huts the enemy soon appeared their caravan con-
sisted of one camel bearing a kind of closed palanquin with gertrude and
fatima within  three others followed on which norbert doctor briet and
mabrouki all gagged and chained had journered five days  the rear was
brought up by the dwarf of rhadameh mounted on a magnificent arab
steed and followed by his negro guard

   at the first glimpse virgil saw it was his master and he knew that some
misfortune had happened but his intrepid heart knew no hesitation

   halt  he cried stepping out alone twenty paces in advance of the
troops what are your intentions  why do you keep these gentlemen
prisoners and subject them to this shameful treatment  

   kaddour had ridden up to the head of his troop surprised at first by the
unexpected resistance he quickly recovered his audacity  finding that his
own guard was three times stronger than the opposing one

   my intention is he replied arrogantly to take possession of the
peak of tehbali surrender instantly or be annihilated  

    surrender our arms   exclaimed virgil  wretched dwarf you shall
swallow them first  

   he turned round and drawing his sword gave the word of command to
his troop  make ready  present  fire  

   to the extreme surprise of both the command was not obeyed on either
side one of the dwarfs officers left the ranks and came up to speak to
him  whilst chaka likewise left his comrades and approaching virgil said
pointing to the negro guard of the dwarf 

     the sons of the great fake war not against each other command us
what thou wilt except tofire upon our brethren

   at the same time the dwarfs officer was saying 

    these men are like ourselves the children of the great fake countries
brothers do not fight

   kaddour foamed at the mouth and bit his nails in impotent rage but he
saw that his anger was all in vain and muttered in a choked voice 

    well then file to the left and let us return whence we came  

   but virgil was not going to suffer this he had been a silent spectator of
the scene and he intended to free his master

    wait he cried rushing at him  there is no reason why we should
not fight though our troops refuse to do so come on and let the conqueror
take the prisoners   

   this bold challenge was loudly applauded by the negro guard ou both
sides they knew well how to appreciate deeds of valor

   without pausing for a repty virgil threw himself upon kaddour with


a month in the moon

uplifted sword the dwarf had only time to parry the first blow by making
his horse curvet and to thrust with his fine damascus steel blade virgil
stood on guard when suddenly his sword broke short off as the blades met

   every one thought he was done for but not so scarcely was he dis-
armed when he bounded like a tiger at the dwarfs throat and seizing him
in his strong hands lifted him bodily out of the saddle and hurled him to the
ground where he held him pinned down by the knee before the wretch could
move a finger in his own defense

   the brave deed was loudly cheered by both sides had virgil been
armed there is no doubt that the dwarf would then and there have expi-
ated his misdeeds as it was he was almost strangled by the grip of the
algerian

   but when the first moment of anger was over virgil thought he had
better not push his victory any further seeing that his enemy was down and
apparently stunned he made a sign therefore to his men to carry away the
inanimate body of the dwarf

   the negro guard of kaddour came up at once to fraternize with the men
of tehbali they screamed and danced and embraced each other alter-
nately it was evident that there could be no question in future of any
enmity between them

   perhaps the dwarfs guard were the most satisfied with a result that
delivered them forever from his tyrannous rule they let themselves there-
fore be led away without protest and did not even make a pretence of
opposing virgil who had hastened at once to the prisoners

   it was the work of two minutes to deliver norbert mauny the doctor and
mabrouki from their bonds and to take gertrude and fatima out of the
palanquin they had witnessed the foregoing scene from behind the closed
blinds of their prison

   norberts first thought  regaining his freedom was to put gertrude out
of the reach of further danger he at once sent her on in front with the
doctor and fatima he then commissioned virgil to enroll the dwarfs
guards among his own troops

   but after consultation among themselves the officers declined the offer
saying that the dwarf of rliadaineh having been beaten in fair combat they
would make  opposition against his having personally to bear the conse-
quences of his defeat  but it would be incompatible with their honor as free
lances to enter the service of the conqueror just as in like manner they
could not in honor make war against their brethren

   they added that they were sure of employment elsewhere the mahdi
was marching on khartoum  they would go at once and take service under
his banner

   norbert could not but honor these chivalrous motives so often noted
by travelers in the poor children of the lake countries exiled and homeless
as they were he asked them to accept some refreshment as a favor to him-
self and cordially shaking hands with their officers he bade them farewell
and hastened to climb the peak of tehbali once again

   he was followed by the negro guard under virgil the unconscious


a month in the moon	

kaddour was carried on a shield by four men and in the distance resembled
nothing so much as a piece of roast beef on a large dish as sir bucephalus
remarked on seeing the approaching procession

   norberts first care was to have the dwarf conveyed to the chamber
vacated by the three   commissioners of control   this room opened off
from the right hand side of the circular passage the doctor was requested
by norbert to attend to the dwarfs injuries and a sentinel was posted at the
door of the room norbert then hastened to the drawing room where
gertrude hardly as yet recovered from her agitation smilingly awaited him

   now that the danger was past they could measure its extent what
would have become of them had it not been for the sudden disaffection of the
two troops and the heroic presence of mind of virgil 

  there was no doubt but that the dwarf of rhadameh would have
destroyed the works pillaged the observatory murdered every man in
tehbali perhaps with horrible torments now they were free and victorious
and he was in their power

   had norbert given rein only to his indignation at the presumption of the
miserable charletan in daring to raise his eyes to gertrude and to subject
himself norbert to such ignominous treatment he would have made short
work of the wretch  but with a delicacy of sentiment that all noble natures
will appreciate he mistrusted his first impulse so far as to postpone carrying
it out whilst the dwarf lay unconscious  and hence his first act was to request
the doctor to attend to the prisoner

   briet reported the dwarf as still insensible and suffering apparently from
congestion of the brain all idea of capital punishment was set aside for the
time therefore since no one kills a stunned and defenseless enemy

   the question also rose as to whether it was not after all a fortunate
occurrence that he should be still alive for he might turn out to be a useful
hostage with reference to the mogaddem of rhadameh and the cherofa tribe
this was the unanimous opinion after they had discussed the facts that had
come to light and had thanked virgil profusely for the brave heroism that
had changed the tragic situation into one of rejoicing and triumph

   gertrude recounted the episode of gordons telegram and the witchcraft
by which kaddour had tried to dazzle her there could be no doubt that he
was perhaps the most important personage in the soudan owing to the extent
of his knowledge and his occult power it might well be that fate had put
into norberts hand the sole weapon whereby to subdue not merely the tribes
of the soudan but the population of all mussulman lands

   the dwarf had boasted that in his hands the mahdi was but a puppet who
would dance to his piping the mahdi was certainly marching upon
khartoum and if the despatches of gordon were stopped and changed as
seen by gertrude this rendered the approaching advent of an english army
of relief less and less probable in fine it was all important to guard their
hostage even if only from the narrow personal point of view that their work-
men at tehbali needed recruiting

   it was necessary then to cure him and keep him in sight for the
common safety depended perhaps on his life


a month in the moon

   virgil received orders to double the guard outside the prison room and to
be on watch against the certain attempt of the prisoner once afoot again to
make good his escape

    do not fear but that i shall keep my eye on him he answered when
norbert gave him his instructions  i am not going to be done by a misera-
ble insect like that  

chapter xx-the dwarf at bay

   seated at the telescope on the peak of tehbali gertrude each morning
surveyed the plain in the direction of khartoum hoping to see a group of
travelers coming toward the peak but though her great impatience to see
her father wras very natural she was too well bred to obtrude it upon her host
and kept to herself the bitter disappointment of each day as it came bringing
no news it was with a heavy heart often that she took her seat at the
breakfast table

   her traveling companions for their part did their best to distract her
thoughts and were careful not to touch upon the subject uppermost in the
minds of all the doctor especially tried to amuse them with a daily ac-
count of his clinical observations

    the dwarf   said he one morning as he seated himself beside his niece
at breakfast  is one of the most singular beings i have ever seen he has
been conscious now for forty eight hours and i have not been able to extract
a word from him  can it be that his speaking faculties are injured by some
lesion of the brain  or is he shamming dumbness as he did on the two
first occasions of our meeting him  it is impossible to say and i have ndt
been able to discover whether he is black or white as he might very well be
after what gertrude witnessed during her imprisonment i should not be
at all surprised if he were dyed from head to foot for his skin is of a slate
color quite unlike those of other nubians but many things that we in
europe cannot do are but childs play to the eastern magicians and i should
not be at all surprised if this were of the number  

   as soon as he was on his feet again the dwarf was permitted to take the
air twice a day in the circular passage under the eye of the sentinel at his
door and of the body guard who were about twenty yards distant all
communications between him and the soldiers were forbidden  but the pro-
hibition seemed unnecessarj for kaddour never said a word nor made the
least sign  he merely dragged himself about wrapped in a huge white bur-
nouse

   more frequently he would spend the whole hour allotted for exercise
upright in a corner some distance from the soldiers and perfectly motionless
his forehead supported by his right hand as if absorbed in meditation

   at other times seating himself on a stone he would take off his left sandal
and grasp his foot in both hands considering it attentively after the fashion
of the fakirs but never not even by a glance did he evince the least wish
to converse with his keepers

   virgil wlio kept a sharp eye upon him at these times ended by being
a month in the moon



completely at rest on this point there was one thing however that he
virgil could not help partly because he did not see its danger and partly
because he was himself slightly under its influence  this was the effect upon
the minds of those who were the daily witnesses of the silent and meditative
attitude and behavior of kaddour they all began to consider him a per-
sonage of note on account of the austerity of his demeanor

   one morning he cut a hazel stick from the hedge and made of it a wand
about ten inches in length employing all his leisure moments afterwards in
carving figures upon it with a splinter of glass that he had picked up under a
window there was nothing to be said about this for from time immemorial
carving wood has been the favorite diversion of prisoners

   one day when virgil having satisfied himself that everything was going
on well in the circular passage had departed to visit the works in progress
cliaka and some of his men were sitting in the sun outside their barracks
chatting about their own country

     alas   said one  when shall we see bahr-el ghazal again where the
crocodiles were as gentle as doves and the herbs like small trees   

      where the corn bears fruit eight days after it is sown    added an-
other

     the supreme master said a voice behind the soldiers  can make the
corn grow and ripen in less than an hour  

     who speaks thus in the language of our fathers   cried chaka turning
round in surprise

    he caught sight of kaddour standing motionless and upright at the rope
barrier of his yard

     thou hast uttered a great word my brother resumed the young chief 
 but who is this powerful supreme master 

     he who was who is and who will be   replied the dwarf solemnly

      and you have seen him do what you say   

   not only have i seen him do it but he has conferred the same super-
natural power on myself  

      thou knowest how to make the corn grow in less than an hour   

     in a few minutes if you like

    all the soldiers leaped to their feet in a fever of ardent curiosity
    father said chaka here are seeds of corn  make them take root

    in order to do that i must be surrounded by twenty of those who have
been ill treated  

       who are the   

   seek them son seek them they have not white faces

    ah   cried chaka  black men  call our brethren   he added to
his companions pointing to the free lances inside the barracks

   in a few minutes twenty men stood around the cord barrier the dwarf
then walking backwards to the middle of his yard and making signs that
strict silence was to be maintained took out the wooden wand he had so
patiently carved and waved it over his head while he uttered some cabalistic
words

   then he drew a great circle  the ground and squatting down in the

      g


a month in the moon

  middle of it dug five or six holes with his hand in these holes he placed
  the seeds given him by chaka and covered them over with a pinch of earth
  moistened with saliva

     kaddour again brandished his wand over the circular trench that con-
  tained the seeds and murmured some incomprehensible words at the end
  of a few moments the earth was seen to rise up slightly over the holes and
  some little green shoots appeared these growing gradually turned out to
  be reeds that in ten minutes reached the height of ten inches

      at this sight the black warriors no longer able to contain their admira-
  tion uttered loud cries kaddour silenced them with his uplifted hand and
  went on with his incantations the corn continued to grow and soon it
  overtopped the dwarf who was now standing up a little bud appeared on
  every branch and in another minute or two it would have swelled up burst
  into blossoms and subsequently have ripened into ears

      chaka said the dwarf on a sudden from the middle of his green
  circle  wouldst thou behold him whom thou didst most hate 

      he of whom thou speakest is dead   replied the young chief with a
  triumphant laugh

       i know it thou art thinking of the son of zebehr whose head the
  basliibazouks cut off three years ago  

       father cried chaka  thou readest the very thoughts of men  

       as likewise i can call up the dead this very evening if thou wilt
i will show thee suliman the son of zebehr he who ordered thee to be
ibg-g-ecz or ass azressjrb je sfa fe	mfaf ae ss sajferhg asce

shall crave thy pardon for his crimes

   i will father  we all will   replied chaka trembling at the idea of
seeing the persecutor of his childhood once more face to face

   well then all of you pass before my window this evening at the hour
when the moon hides herself behind the hills of darfour you shall then
see suliman   

  kaddour had scarcely ceased to speak when the outer door opened and
virgil appeared on the threshold

  hardly had the negro guard time to glance at the newcomer before the
corn had already disappeared being torn up by the roots and smuggled
under the folds of the dwarfs robe he stood silent and motionless as if
absorbed in his wonted meditation

  but virgil saw quite enough to convince him that something unusual was
going on the troubled startled expression on the faces of the black men
as they stood close pressed against the cord barrier spoke for itself he was
careful however not to disclose his suspicions and shortly withdrew having
seen kaddour once more safely caged but virgil wisely determined all the
same to redouble his precautions

 chapter xxi-summary measures

  when the time came for his usual evening round virgil saw that the
guard were in a state of evident agitation or impatience and seemed to be
a month in the moon



waiting for something to happen he ordered the lights to be extinguished
at an early hour and made a pretense of retiring  but returning almost
directly by the other entrance to the circular passage he posted himself where
he could watch without being observed

   virgil soon found that the guard also were watching in the dark which
decided him to wait until the reason for this extraordinary behavior should
become clear

   the moon had just sunk below the horizon when chaka and his men left
the barracks one by one and proceeded on tiptoe towards the prison they
were evidently trying to make as little noise as possible but that they were
very excited was plain from the stifled exclamations that escaped them in the
course of the very voluble conversation that was carried on in whispers

   it was a dark night and virgil could not well see what was happening 
but on a sudden a bright light from one of the windows of kaddours lodging
shone out on the guard grouped in front the warriors brave as they were
before the enemy seemed all stricken with terror and clung close to each
other not daring to move backwards or forwards

   in the opening of the window stood a white wooden table unevenly made
and devoid of cover or any ornament whatsoever a brass dish was on the
table and it contained a bleeding human head which all the warriors recog-
nized for that of suliman the son of zebehr -of suliman who had been
dead for three years  the head lifted itself off the dish opened its eyes and
looked about 

   all at once the lips of the dead man moved were they about to speak 
they did speak and with the identical guttural drawl that had characterized
the son of zebehr

    i made you suffer said the voice   now i suffer  listen to me sons
of the lake  listen to me if you would escape the torments that i endure
in the cavern of death  you must embrace the cause of the prophet  you
must obey the orders he gives you through his faithful servant kaddour 
you must cease to serve the unbelievers and you must unite with your black
brethren against the europeans  unless you massacre the white men you
will see them triumphant throughout the desert and they will drink your
blood  take heed to my words sons of the lake for i have spoken thus to
you to buy  own pardon   

   the light then went out and the vision disappeared but the guard were
still further terrified b a long sigh-a heart rending sob-that seemed to
come from the very bowels of the earth surprise and horror kept them for
some time motionless and when at length they dared to move all withdrew
in silence to their barracks

   virgil thought rightly that there was not a moment to lose lighting his
lantern that he had before purposely extinguished lest they should see him
he ran to the door of the prison unlocked it and surprised kaddour in the
act of taking off his masquerading costume and its accompanying shams

   plaster scratched off the wall had given a deathlike look to his features 
he had opened a small vein in his arm to tinge the linen with blood  the
dressing table out of peter gryphins room had furnished the round hole con-
ioo

a month in the moon

taining the brass dish that held the head  and the mirror to reflect the light
had been borrowed from the lodging of iguaz vogel

   it took but a few minutes for virgil to rush upon the dwarf throw him
down gag him and tie him head and heels he then hurried out and
hastened to report to norbert all that had happened

    you will of course do as you please sir said virgil as he concluded
his recital   but believe me a summary execution is the only way to pre-
vent a revolt among the guard

   although severe measures were foreign to his own ideas and habits nor-
bert was much inclined to agree with virgil the case was very pressing as
well as serious  it was necessary to take immediate steps and to strike a
decisive blow

   weighing the matter well for a few minutes norbert came to the con-
clusion that it would be impossible to spare the life of the dwarf unless in the
presence of his dupes he made full and detailed confession of his trickeries
he therefore seated himself at his desk and drew up a provisional sentence of
death whilst virgil went to arouse the doctor and the baronet

    i am under the dreadful necessity gentlemen said norbert  of de-
creeing on my own responsibility the immediate death of a man i need not
tell you how painful it is to me to have to do this but i could not hesitate
without serious peril to the precious lives under my charge when i leave
this land i shall make it my duty to submit my conduct in the matter and to
lay the circumstances before a duly qualified tribunal i have sent for you
to ask you to be so good as to sign the official report that shall be drawn up  
on hearing the details the doctor and sir bucephalus full approved of
their friends decision and declared their readiness to join him in signing not
merely the official report but likewise the sentence itself but this generous
offer norbert as generously declined to accept

   orders were given to marshal the guard without arms in the circidar
passage to which all repaired the guard being ranged in four lines chaka at
their head

    my friends said norbert  you have been deceived by an imposter
the miserable tricks by which he endeavored to shake your sense of honor
and fidelity were in truth an insult to brave warriors like yourselves i
know well that you would only despise such juggling  but before inflicting
the punishment he deserves for his base intention i wtish you to see by what
means he tried to make fools of you chaka take six men with you and
come with us to the prison  

   the young chief obeyed without a word but it was evident that neither
he nor his warriors expected anything to come of this visit

    here is the table the mirror and the blood stained linen used by the
imposter said norbert proceeding to explain to the negroes the different
uses of these accessories in the imposition of the   speaking head  

     but where is the head of suliman    said chaka ironically pretending
not to understand norbert

   at the same instant he caught sight of the corn stalks brought by
kaddour
a month in the moon

ioi

    and this corn how did he make it grow in less than an hour  he
asked  for we saw it grow under our eyes

   this was news to norbert who had of course no explanation to give
the men looked at one another and shoon their heads

    bring out the condemned man   said the astronomer as he reentered
the circular passage with his followers

   virgil soon returned with the dwarf whose countenance betokened no
anxiety whatever

   stand there said norbert pointing to the wall i will read you
your sentence

   the document that he proceeded to read aloud by the light of a torch was
lengthy and set forth all the facts of the case concluding with the following
words

    wherefore because of tlie aforesaid crimes of abduction arbitrary detention exciting
to massacre and attempt to entice away the dwarf kaddour is condemned to the penalty
of death he will be shot ten minutes after he shall liave had notice of this sentence

norbert mauny

   mabrouki translated these words to the guard who received them in pro-
found silence it was evident that they were looking for the manifestation
of the power of kaddour by some fresh prodigy

   norbert turned to him

    you have heard he said  one chance is still left to you confess
and explain immediately the witchcraft whereby you tried to delude these
brave warriors if you do this -thoroughly and candidly your life shall be
spared  

    i want no favor replied kaddour calmly and not without some dignity

    you have still seven minutes to decide continued norbert taking out
his chronometer  if you -will only own to your fraud the sentence shall be
commuted into imprisonment mabrouki virgil he added  prepare your
weapons  

    i ask no favor repeated the dwarf in a firm voice  i will not even
wait for the expiration of your seven minutes  i will hasten to taste eternal
felicity and will not tarry- for your signal   

   saying this he hurriedly- drew from his finger a ring whose crystal bezil
opened by means of a spring and put it to his lips

    it is he murmured  the ring of bblis the angel of death who will
conduct me to the abode of the blessed   

   he fell back as if struck by lightning the doctor examined the motion-
less corpse the skin was already cold the pulse had stopped the eyes were
glassed over the heart had ceased to beat

    death must have been instantaneous said briet  it must have been
caused by some such rapid poison as prussic acid but what is it i
wonder 

   he took the ring from the dead mans hand all that was left in the
bezil was a faint indication of a bluish liquid that evaporated in a few
minutes so that any analysis was out of the question

    he has spared us the trouble of shooting him  it was the best thing he


a month in the moon

could have done  and we must at least own that lie died bravely added
norbert by way of a funeral oration

   he ordered the body to be taken back to the prison and to be buried on
the following morning

   the guard petitioned to have this charge intrusted to them it was
granted and a few minutes before sunrise they accompanied the dead man to
his burying place  the eastern slope of tehbali according to the custom
of the arabs he was interred in a rockhewn cave and the entrance was closed
with a large stone

chapter xxii-an exciting crisis

   the first event of importance during the following days was an attempt
by aben-zegri and the other clierofas to blow up the glass furnaces it was
soon frustrated by the assistance of the guard norbert adhered to his usual
policy of moderation and contented himself with expelling the delinquents
from his workshops warning them that if they were found there again they
would be subjected to all the rigors of martial law

   aben-zegri and his accomplices were deprived of their weapons and con-
ducted to the boundary of the plateau of tehbali where they were left at
liberty with sufficient provisions to last them for eight days they went out
into the desert and were no more heard of

   eight days went by peacefully yet the news brought by the convoys
from berber grew worse and worse it was known now with certainty that
osman digua held the suakim route and that other arab corps had been
seen even in the neighborhood of dongola thus barring the nile route also

   all communication with khartoum was interrupted  the telegraph wire
appeared to have been cut for no more despatches came  the mahdist inva-
sion was everywhere the invading army a hundred thousand strong
occupied omdurman and was already beating like the waves of a stormy sea
against the ramparts of khartoum

   tomorrow perhaps would come the turn of berber and tehbali in any
case all idea of retreat either byway of egypt or by the red sea was at an
end since every communication was closed and the arab tribes had all risen
darfour even had joined the irresistible insurrection of eastern africa against
the hated european yoke

   the hour so often foretold and so long delayed had at last come and
alone in the sea of tumult tehbali stood solitary as an island the center of a
circle three hundred leagues in extent wherein raged the unchained violence
of fanatical hatred and lawless passion

   gertrude would not however give up hope of seeing her father nor-
bert and the doctor had been careful not to let her suspect the loving deceit
whereby the consul had managed to spare her the horrors of the siege little
thinking poor man that he had made the sacrifice of her society only to send
her into greater danger

   gertrude did not know this and in her trustful simplicity she mounted
every day to the cupola of the observatory like another sister anne at her
a month in the moon



tower and swept the vast plain with the powerful glasses in the vain hope of
seeing the beloved form in the distance

   one day she saw not him indeed but a numerous troop of arabs
wrapped in burnouses negroes armed with spears a whole squadron of ir-
regular cavalry amid which gleamed the brass of two cannons and the steel
of five hundred sabers or guns

    she hastened to inform norbert who had no sooner verified the news for
himself than virgil received instant orders to put tehbali into a state of
defense the cannons were loaded the machine guns put into position  the
guard drawn up on the esplanade in readiness to repulse an attack virgil
at the head of a detachment of twelve men descended to the foot of the
mountain to form an outpost with orders to fall back on the observatory if he
was assailed

    norbert surveyed the position through the telescope at the end of an
hour he saw the enemy halt and a little group of horsemen detach them-
selves from the rest and advance waving a flag of truce

   virgil met them and led them along the peak road norbert was soon
able to distinguish the black faces of the newcomers as their spirited little
horses shaking their shaggy manes which were almost as long as their tails
galloped swiftly up the zigzag route to the observatory

    at the edge of the esplanade the troop stopped short and the chief alone
accompanied only by a trumpeter entered the hall where norbert the
baronet and the doctor awaited him

    he was richly dressed  the saber that hung by his side was exquisitely
embossed and a sparkling aigrette surmounted his turban norbert advanced
courteously a few steps to meet him and addressing him in terms of warm
welcome asked wherefore he had come to tehbali

    art thou the chief inquired the barbarian in evident astonishment
that no outward sign of authority was apparent about norbert

     i am the chief replied norbert with dignity  who has sent thee
to me   

     i come said the arab drawing himself up to his full height 
the part of the holy prophet the most high and powerful lord the mahdi  

    he stopped as if to enjoy the effect he thought these words would doubt-
less produce he evidently expected that at the sacred name of the holy
prophet every head would be bowed in the dust but instead of the respect-
ful fear to which he was accustomed he saw a mocking smile on the doctors
lips whilst norbert with the slightest of bows simply asked 

    what does the mahdi want frem us

   this said the arab with gleaming eyes the mahdi summons the
unbelievers of tehbali to surrender at discretion and come to his camp at
omdurman there to embrace the mussulman faith

      is that all   muttered the doctor

      and what right has the mahdi to send us such a summons    asked

norbert

     the right of his divine mission answered the arab  and for those
who refuse to recognize this the right of the strongest  


a month in the moon

    well then replied norbert  go and tell your master that we know
him not nor wish to know him  tell him that it is in nowise the part of a
shepherd of men to provoke those who are not his enemies and have never
done harm to any of his  add moreover that it is an intolerable piece of im-
pudence to offer terms of capitulation before giving battle  

    have i heard aright  cried the arab  barest thou defy the mahdi
after refusing his magnanimous offer   

    i defy no one but i ask to be left in peace to pursue my work

     woe to you    said the envoy   accuse no one but yourself of the
ruin that shall overtake you  

   turning on his heel he went without another word to rejoin his escort
at the edge of the esplanade where he threw himself into his saddle and rode
down the peak road turning round ouce towards the observatory with a
threatening and insulting gesture

   he had scarcely gone out of sight around the first zigzag when a great
uproar arose on the esplanade virgils voice was heard high above the rest
in tones of violent rage norbert hastened to the spot and found his trusty
lieutenant striving in vain to hold back the guard who were hurrying after
the envoys

    the prophet has spoken and we will not remain with the iufidels said
one of the negroes

    it is a disgrace    retorted virgil   desert your flag in this way  i
will blow out the brains of the first who tries to pass  

   virgil said norbert no violence  call cliaka at once and have
two or three of these men put in irons  

   but the negro burst into an insolent laugli

   thats it he said call chaka and may all whom thou callest to
thy aid respond as he will to thy appeal

   and before virgil had time to guess his intentions he bounded over him
like a panther and hurried down the road

    what does all this mean  asked norbert

   nothing good i fear replied virgil at the same moment chaka
came with the remainder of the men and advancing alone toward norbert
said in a loud voice 

    tord of tehbali i had sworn fealty to thee thou didst spit in my
hand and chaka respects covenants but thou hast brokei this one the
death of kaddour lies between us thou art powerful but thou art as noth-
ing beside him who made the corn to grow before my eyes all is over
between us strive not to retain us farewell  the prophet calls and we
obey his voice  

   norbert saw at a glance that there was nothing to be done in the face of
such a decision had these men attacked him he could have met force with
force  but what could he do to those who simply refused service and for-
swore their contract he went back to the hall in silence while the guard
defiled before chaka and went off down the road

   this defection made matters serious at the head of a compact little
troop norbert might have defied the mahdi but now that he had only
a month in the moon



himself to depend upon and the assistance such as it was of the doctor
the baronet virgil and smith diplomacy appeared the wiser course to adopt

   he made up his mind therefore to send mabroulci at once to the mahdis
camp to offer to treat on honorable terms-to pay if necessary double the
amount of tribute that he had paid the mogaddem so as to be left in peace to
go on with his work he had learned by experience that gold was almighty
even in the desert aud he thought it best to try every measure before pro-
ceeding to extremes

   mabroulci started off with orders to reach omdurman before the envoys
if possible aud with full powers to negotiate with the mahdi

   meantime the garrison of the observatory was reduced to five men  and
there were three prisoners to be guarded in the furnace at the foot of the
mountain

   but the departure of the guard was not to be the only disaster caused by
the visit of the mahdist envoy it was followed by the loss of the greater
number of the laborers and the glass makers who left the workshops in
crowds whether to join the mahdi or from fear of his vengeance should they
remain at tehbali  one knew

   it was a cruel disappointment to norbert just when the sheet of glass
under tehbali already overflowed so that ten or twelve more yards would
have completed the isolation of the peak he was almost disheartened so
near the completion of his efforts with every reason to believe that a week
more of regular work would suffice to accomplish the end he had in view
and on a sudden to find himself deserted by the best men in his army of
workers 

   he thought night aud day liow he could possibly by mere force of will
overcome this new difficulty  but it was all in vain  look at the question
from whatever aspect he chose no substitute offered itself for the missing
hands aud he was at his wits end

   day by day he grew thinner and paler and he could not sleep at night
from the anxiety and worry of mind so much trouble and hard work 
was it to be all in vain and the money thrown away 

    surely not   said norbert

   the words were hardly out of his mouth when virgil rushed in

    grand news sir  the sheet of glass has overflowed on the west side

   the fact was of the greatest importance and norbert hastened to the
foot of the mountain to verify the report it was true the sheet of glass
had at length filled up the depths in the center of the pyritic base and had
joined the other end of the circle thus making it complete

   the liquid stream overflowed the rock mass and lay before them sur-
rounded by the sand heaps in a glutinous soft sheet that soon would be
hard and vitrified it was done there was no doubt about the matter
the peak of tehbali-the enormous rock of bisulphide of iron-was isolated
from its sandy subsoil by a sheet of glass it was isolated even from the ter-
restrial globe

there at length was the colossal magnet dreamed of by norbert mauri
it lay before them an inert mass seemingly but yet full of power that
io

a month in the moon

wanted only the stimulus of electricity to render it irresistible and this
would be supplied without delay if need were

   everything was in readiness norbert had but to give the order and the
solar heat condensers that stood stationed at intervals along the circular pas-
sage would set all the dynamos at work the least sign from him and the
lever would act on the motor a and establish contact

   at last then the magnet of tehbali was a reality nay it was more 
it was a new agent among the enormous forces that regulate the planetary
system 

   the success although foreseen was dazzling indeed and norbert might
be pardoned an involuntary sense of proud self satisfaction at so complete a
realization of his aspirations he recovered his usual calmness of demeanor
however and when he entered the observatory he told virgil simply to
bring up all the heat condensers as they were no longer needed below

chapter xxiii-the experiment commences

   the mahdist invasion was gradually and surely spreading on all sides
the inhabitants of the desert are very methodical in their doings and take
time to look before they leap  but the circle was gradually closing in round
tehbali in three days all the approaches were blocked and camps of obser-
vation were to be seen posted on the surrounding heights the peak was
now completely invested

   but our friends had not been idle all the condensers had been taken up
to the circular passage the connecting wires of the electro dynamos were in
readiness to be attached to the shafts moved by the pistons of the cylinders in
the center of each conical mirror it only rested with norbert to order the
contact to be established and in less than ten minutes the grand experiment
would begin

   strange to say the young scientist hesitated at this last moment he
shrank from putting the final touch to the work he had so ardently and
patiently carried out he said to himself

     who knows but that after all i may have made a mistake  it is true
that i have made ever possible calculation and as i think have foreseen
every contingency but what if some forgotten detail should subvert the
whole theory and give the lie to all my expectations  how could i bear to
see such a humiliating and shameful end of all my plans and before gertrude
too who believes in me  before the baronet who does not believe in me 
before the formidable mahdi and in the face of scoffing europe herself 
what if my success should be but partial  the other hand and just save
my self conceit but fail to realize the scheme in its entirety  

   another consideration encouraged him in his passive attitude the moon
would not be in perigee-that is to say nearest to the earth-for another
sixty seven days ft was evident that the experiment would have a greater
chance of success then  and prudence therefore coimseled delay unless
indeed some unexpected turn of events forced him to precipitate matters

   the unexpected soon came however
a month in the moon



   on the sixth day after the arrival tinder the walls of tehbali of the left
wing of the mahdists who had turned aside from the siege of khartoum to
assail the peak it became evident that an assault was prepamig

   horsemen went and came from one camp to another  tribes formed them-
selves into columns  tom toms resounded  every side and thousands of
weapons gleamed in the sunshine on a sudden one of the columns got into
marching order and drew toward the village of tehbali now entirely deserted
by its inhabitants the other columns proceeded eastward and northward in
the direction of the peak

   there was not a moment to be lost in checking this movement one of
the cannons behind a little earth mound on the esplanade was pointed on the
village which the south column had now almost reached

     fire   said norbert

   the cannon ball flew through the air and fell bursting behind the attack-
ing column it was not a bad shot for a first attempt none of the assail-
ants were hit but they were panic stricken by the noise in their rear and
they fled in disorder the other columns followed their example

   for two or three days they gave no more sign of life soon howrever
they were seen working hard at planting cannon batteries on the adjacent
heights and on the seventh day of the assault one of these batteries opened
fire

   not a single cannon ball so much as touched the observatory which stood
much higher than the guns of the besiegers but several projectiles fell
upon the furnaces and the other buildings at the base of the peak and it was
clear that the enemy aimed especially at destroying the works

   this was too much for norberts philosophy his lonely plateau wras to
him the whole world and so on the second day of the bombardment he
resolved to see for himself what harm had been done taking advantage of
the time of siesta when even the cannons voice was silenced and all the
world slept besiegers as well as besieged he went alone and on foot
cautiously down the mountain

   there was not much harm done but still quite sufficient to disquiet him
he came to a sudden resolution to try the final coup at once

   virgil he said on his return to the summit join the connecting
wires to the shafts of the heat condensers  

   it was now forty eight minutes past two oclock a searching sun shone
right down on the bayouda desert virgil set about his work undisturbed
at the end of half an hour he returned to the gallery of telescopes where
norbert was observing the sky and announced that all the heat condensers
were at work

   according to the calculations it took five minutes for the maximum effect
of the machines to be attained and a quarter of an hour to charge the accu-
mulators this done the action could be kept up continually day and
night

   norbert waited twenty minutes watch in hand and then went to the hall
of motors

   here he found sir bucephalus reading the lastest number of the times
io

a month in the moon

    you have forgotten a very important point my dear mauny he said
we ought to have established a pigeon post to bring up the latest news
if we only had that i should not much mind the siege so far

   the siege will soon be raised replied norbert smiling  i have
made up my mind to act if it were only to terrify those wretches

   sir bucephalus looked at him speechless with surprise and curiosity
norbert simply walked to the right wall took hold of the ivory knob of the
moter a and slowly lowered it an electric tinkle was at once heard

    contact is made and the experiment commences said norbert with
more emotion than he cared to show  it is now he continued looking
at his timepiece  exactly thirty eight minutes and fourteen seconds past
three oclock

chapter xxiv -the descent of the moon

   the baronet waited a little while before speaking then finding that
the little electric twinkle had ceased without any apparent result he walked
to the window stifling a laugh

   at that moment the moon in her first quarter appeared in the horizon
plainly discernible although it was still broad daylight

     it seems to me that the queen of the night wants a good deal of press-
iug and does not trouble about us much   said he turning to norbert

    you are making a slight mistake continued norbert  matters can-
not go quite so fast have you forgotten the distance that separates us from
that moon  it will take her not less than six days eight hours twenty one
minutes and forty six seconds to come down to us if i have calculated
rightly you see we have plenty of time to prepare to receive her

   the baronet said nothing but was evidently far from being convinced
norbert did not insist

    excuse me he said a moment later  i am going to take a measure-
ment with the telescope

    going into the hall of telescopes he seated himself at his place of obser-
vation in order to make a note of the micrometrical measure of the disk as it
appeared then no further allusion was made in the course of the day to the
progress of the experiment	

   night came the condensers had naturally ceased to work when 
longer supplied by the sun but the accumulators set in motion by the
simple turning of a lever had automatically supplied the place of these
machines and so the magnet of tehbali was constantly fully charged as
shown by the magnetometer

    every one retired to rest at midnight as usual with the exception of the
doctor who was on guard on the espjsmade to keep a lookout on the move-
ments of the enemy and norbert who chose to keep him company

   the moon set at nineteen minutes after two in the morning just before
she reached the western edge of the horizon norbert left the doctor aud
went to the observatory to take a fresh measurement he discovered that the
moons diameter zvas increased by the thirtieth of a degree
a month in the moon



   he would liave been much surprised not to have made this discovery
and yet he had doubted up to this very moment  but now all doubt was at
an end

   in less than eleven hours the moon hf already come appreciably nearer
to the earth the problem was solved the undertaking was accomplished
the magnet of tehbali was having the expected effect and by its added
power increasing the attraction of the terrestrial globe

   norbert was at first almost stunned by the startling success of his efforts

   he must have been ina kind of vertigo all night for on waking in the
morning he found himself stretched on a sofa head aching and limbs bruised
without any recollection of how he came there

   he ran to the magnetometer the tension was still at the maximum
the sun was rising and would set the parabolic mirrors in action there
was no reason why the experiment should not go  to the end by itself
how impatiently did the young astronomer await the return of the moon to
continue his observations

   she rose that day at thirty six minutes after four oclock in the afternoon
long before the time norbert had his eye glued to the telescope in readiness
to take a fresh measurement no sooner did she appear above the horizon
than it became perfectly clear that it would be quite useless to take a micro-
metric measurement for since the evening before her diameter had more than
doubled she now described an arc of one degree six minutes twenty eight
seconds

   the increase was so remarkable that everyone was struck by it soon
groups of arabs stood about the plain contemplating the moon with aston-
ishment doubtless they considered the phenomenon to be a favorable
augury for they did not seem to be in the least terrified

   at three oclock in the morning shortly before the moon set norbert dis-
covered that her diameter had again increased and now measured nearly two
degrees

   on the third day the moon appeared in the east at forty two minutes after
five oclock it was not as yet very bright the sun now being in the west
but the circumference was immense  the moon now described an arc of nine
degrees  that is to say forty full moons of this size would have sufficed if
close together to fill up the entire circumference of the horizon

   when evening came and the sun having set a little before seven left the
enormous lunar globe reigning alone in the heavens a feeling of indescribable
dread came to all who looked at her she was be it remembered only as yet
iu the eleventh day of lunation

   in the abnormal moonlight almost as bright as day they could discern
from the top of the terrace the behavior of the arabs in the plain below
prostrated  the earth with extended arms the mahdists were evidently dis-
turbed the sound of the tom tom could be plainly heard and in the still
evening air the voices of the imams and dervishes floated up as iu deep
earnest tones they implored aloud the divine protection

   these supplications went on all night until about thirty seven minutes
past three in the morning when the moon disappearing beneath the horizon
i io

a month in the moon

the arabs concluded that the prophet had heard them and had blessed their
cause

   this assumption on their part was a disappointment to norbert it was
clear that they had been terrified yet not sufficiently so to make them give
up their enterprise

   howbeit when the moon rose on the following day at forty five minutes
past six in the evening occupying twenty one degrees or nearly a quarter of
the half circle of the horizon the arabs recommenced their salaams and
prayers but evinced no intention of raising the siege of tehbali

   the moon now filled up so to say all one side of the heavens with the
exception of a blue space between her edge and the horizon she was nearly
round and white as milk the protuberances on her surface standing out
plainly with the naked eye could be seen chains of mountains plains
dotted over with mountainous peaks and yawning craters great blue spaces
that were either oceans or deserts coasts bristling with cliffs frowning rocks
and deep abysses

   with the telescope far more was discernible the least detail of the land-
scape appeared as plainly as does the earth when viewed from a balloon

   any doubt that gertrude may have entertained concerning the correct-
ness of the lunar photographs adorning the observatory walls was now en-
tirely dissipated for in the planet now drawing so near she beheld all the
notable features of the lunar map as photographed standing out clearly and
distinctly

    the evening was passed in admiration of these marvels until a little before
midnight the edge of the disk having reached the western horizon the
planet began to slowly disappear an operation that lasted four hours and
took twenty minutes longer than had been the case when it rose in the
morning

   they had reached the fifth day of the experiment and no one had seemed
to be disturbed by it the arabs had become so accustomed to the phe-
nomenon that it was now only by way of a formula that they continued the
ceremonies of the first evening while as to the besieged they looked out for
the moon each evening with the utmost impatience to examine afresh the
marvels displayed through the telescope

   but when that evening at forty four minutes past seven the planet of the
night appeared on the eastern horizon every one was transfixed with awe at
its formidable appearance it now occupied more than half the circle  or to
speak more correctly the diameter now described an arc of  degrees fifteen
minutes and twenty two seconds

   what was still more alarming only the edge of the disk now was fringed
as it were with a silvery light while all the rest appeared an immense solid
dark body whose convexity was clearly perceptible for the first time one had
the impression of a monstrous globe coming to meet the earth

    and yet as norbert explained to his friends they would not have felt this
impression if the globe had not still been at a considerable distance but all
the same they like the arabs suffered an unusual feeling of oppression so
long as the globe hung over them  and when at thirty three minutes past four
a month in the moon

hi

in the morning the heavens showed only the pale light of stars each one
breathed more freely as if a load were lifted off him

chapter xxv-the final crash

   the sixth evening came it was the last since according to norberts
calculations the descent of the lunar globe was to take six days eight hours
and forty six seconds the moon rose slowly gradually filling up the whole
sky the sight was indeed terrible absolute and complete darkness
reigned everywhere with the exception of a silver band as it were that sur-
rounded and held the moon above the earth

   in the arab camp terror was at its height silence prevailed the very
dogs held their peace every man had retired to his tent where prostrate
in the dust he waited for death

   the thick darkness terrified the mahdists the moon had for a certainty
come to destroy them yet they did not seek to fly but remained apathetically
resigned to the unprecedented catastrophe that had befallen them

   on the peak of tehbali the alarm was general norbert was almost the
only one who kept his self possession sir bucephalus tried to maintain his
usual coolness but in spite of himself the growing uneasiness he could not
but feel manifested itself by continued comings and goings and many ques-
tions

   the baronet was by no means a coward but life was sweet to him  he
was very fond of his club and often thought with a sigh how much he
should like to be back there pie had only joined this expedition in order to
have some adventures to relate and necessarily he must survive them other-
wise how could he relate them 

   the doctor took things cheerily according to his usual habit but he
could not help querying how it would all end virgil never dreamed for a
moment of sitting in judgment on the doings of his  superior officers   but
he thought the sky unusually black and threatening

   smith gave full vent to his disappointment as far as the etiquette of re-
spectful service would permit and took care not to show his nose outside the
door as to fatima she cried bitterly and gertrude had much ado to con-
sole her especially as she was far from being easy herself

   matters went on tolerably well however until midnight every one was
in the hall of motors and smith had just brought in the tea norbert who
had been to look round on the esplanade now came back and going over to
the electric lamp that hung over the table in the center he drew out his
chronometer and said 

    it is twenty two minutes past midnight contact will be established
within a minute and twenty five seconds  

      what contact    asked the baronet

     that of the lunar globe with the earth 

      what  you really expect this contact to take place   

    of course i do what would be the sense of the experiment otherwise 
i transformed the peak of tehbali into a magnet on purpose to force the moon


a month in the moon

to come down to us do you want me now to forego the pleasure of making
her acquaintance and send her back into space 

    you could do it then 

    with the greatest ease simply by the means of that ivory knob yon-
der marked b

    what  the action of your magnet could be suspended simply by
touching the motor b   cried the baronet evidently startled

    not precisely by touching it but by lowering it and raising the
letter a

    in that case my dear friend i am of opinion that you had better use
your power without delay

    there are very good reasons my dear cogliill why i should not follow
your advice 

      then the moon is to fall upon the earth   

     just so

      will it not cause a shock   

      yes for those who happen to be between the anvil and hammer certainly

about a hundred leagues off striking the sahara from the northeast to the
southwest i expect we shall feel a sharp shock but nothing more  

    and supposing you should be mistaken if the shock does fall upon
us 

    in that case of course we shall be crushed but i have not made a

oracle long waited for flung himself on the ebony tablet and before any one
suspected his intention he had seized the knob a with his right hand and the
knob b with his left and raising- the former he lowered the other

   norbert had but just time to rush upon him exclaiming aloud in his anger
and despair

    it was too late 

   a fearful explosion ensued followed by an uproar and din that can only
be likened to the noise of a thousand volcanoes or the roar of a million
cannon

   there was one terrible shock and then darkness sudden and complete
the unfortunate actors of the drama sank unconscious to the floor

   norbert had just strength enough to cry aloud

when he lost consciousness of the disaster that had befallen all alike

a cuban hold up

how the leisurely jaunt of two opinionated americans was subjected to an interruption as
shocking to their nerves as it was galling to their pride-the
panacea developed from a mystery

vxte met them first at matanzas in the pretty plaza across the marble
pavement of which they were leisurely strolling  two most ravishing
cubanas tall and lissome dark of eye and brunette as to complexion

   they were not alone for sometimes behind them sometimes by their
side walked a portly gray haired and white mustached gentleman of dignified
bearing and exceedingly haughty air they too had an atmosphere of
aristocratic breeding  but did not appear to our experienced eyes leaving
their escort out of the personal equation to be absolutely impregnable i
fear we must have stared for the escort glared at us most uncompromisingly
and they gave us one astonished glance out of the corners of their beautiful
eyes and then demurely looked the other way only a glance  but it was a
duplex binocular one and it took our breath away for the space of half an
hour during which we seemed deprived of the power of speech that this
was something unusual may be inferred from the fact that we had safely
weathered several seasons at newport and narragansett pier and had never
 turned a hair but these two were a type all by themselves we told our-
selves when we had regained our hotel and compared our impressions of the
morning

   we met them a second time the very next morning  not on this earth
but beneath it at the yawning mouth of the cave bella-mar where a party
had gathered to explore the secret recesses of that wonderful cavern scene
of yesterday re-enacted  pleading perhaps bold glances from young men 
repellent look from elderly gentleman chaste reserve on part of the young
ladies  so we went into the crystal cavern unrecognized and unacquainted

   the bella-mar is a mammoth cave in miniature  same dark corridors
stalactitic pillars crystal grottoes unfathomed lakes  and finally same  fat
mans purgatory or narrow passage between immovable rocks we had
proceeded well enough up to this point  but here occurred an accident  one
of the young ladies fainted right in mid-passage of the purgatorial pass
there was instant outcry for some sort of restorative and fortunately i had
with me a  pocket pistol filled with that liquor which cheers likewise
inebriates   and which i at once handed to the cuban gentleman promptly
applied to the young ladys lips the generous liquor had the requisite effect
and after she had recovered the flask was returned accompanied with
thanks ornately profusely even expressed by the cuban gentleman it
may have been that i expected some sort of recognition for this opportune
assistance  but if so i was destined to disappointment for the cubans left

a cuban hold up

  without so much as a salutation by the way as we all climbed into our
  volantes for the homeward journey

      thus comes to a close the prefactory portion of my narrative and leaves
  the way open for a line of introduction imprimis  we that is tom
  golding and i had taken a voyage to cuba for the improvement of our
  health which wasnt suffering much and for the extension of a spanish
  vocabulary which was suffering a great deal we arrived at havana but
  poorly equipped for contact with a foreign people and their language relying
  chiefly upon two strong letters of introduction from the head of a prominent
  business house in new york to his commercial correspondent in the interior
  of cuba as a rule letters of introduction to cubans and spaniards are not
  worth the paper tlie are written on  but ours proved the exception we
  received a warm welcome from the havana representative of the planter to
  whom the letters were addressed who assured us that while don antonio
  was not then in town he did not doubt what our reception would be he
  would forward our credentials at once and as it would take several days for
  a reply to reach us we had better  do the town and seethe sights of the
  cuban capital we had faithfully followed the agents advice  had seen all
  the available lions and then taken a run over to matanzas whither the ex-
  pected invitations were to be forwarded

      on our return from the cave we found at our hotel a most cordial invita-
  tion from the planter inclosed from his havana agent and also a passport
  from general campos permitting us to cross the trocha next day at noon
  we were on board the train for colon which if it made schedule time would
  drop us at a side station earh in the evening there we were to stop at a
  fonda over night aud next morning take coach for the remainder of our
  journey

     there was only one passenger cdach on the train and that was hitched
behind a long line of trucks and cattle cars making travel anything hut
agreeable despite the beauty of the scenery by tie way there were few
passengers for at that time cuba was indulging in a general scare and travel
was likely to be interrupted by insurgent raids  but to our great astonish-
ment we observed right in front of us the haughty cuban and his distraet-
ingly beautiful daughters they were his daughters this much we had
learned for they called him papa and devoted themselves most assidu-
ously to his comfort and entertainment

  we were much depressed by this discover and did not recover our
wonted equanimity until some distance on the journey  then feeling tolerably
sure that none of the passengers understood english we chatted unreservedly
of our various impressions but wander as we would afield our conversation
constantly reverted to the most interesting incidents of our trip

   strange coincidence or rather a series of coincidences i remarked

   which was the one who fainted tom-can you tell  

  faith not i they are enough alike to be twins but if there is a
more beautiful girl anywhere in the world than the one at the outside of the
seat it is the one on the inside one of them has made an indelible impres-
sion on my heart but hanged if i know which
a cuban hold up



    i smiled at this for thomas was continually receiving  indelible impres-
 sions which invariably melted and vanished in the gleam of the next pair
 of eyes that looked into his

     yes they are lovely as you say  but we shall probably never see them
 again and so we had best arm ourselves against the inevitable parting now
 to change the subject what do you think of these stories told us in matan-
 zas about the cuban women taking part iu conflicts in the open field  for
 my part i dont believe it is in them

     neither do i sniffed tom  its all tommyrot in my opinion the
 woman doesnt live who would take the chances in open battle she just
 cant do it thats all  it isnt in her the average woman has no sand no
 backbone  she wasnt born that way the men seem brave enough both
 sides  but i dont believe the women have a spark of courage or patriotism 
 or if they have theyve most successfully concealed it

    i might have been deceived but i thought i noted two pairs of lovely
 shoulders stiffen at this remark which could not but have been overheard
 though doubtless not understood the ladies were sitting vfrith their backs
 towards us while the father faced their seats and us at intervals apparently
 dozing but with one eye open

    well i rejoined that isnt a very gallant remark but perhaps the
 estimate of the sex isnt far wrong however why should it concern us
 anyway and why has our conversation taken such a tnrn  now what do
 you think of the scenery for instance arent those beautiful palms over in
 the field yonder  

     sceneiry be blowed  imray for once in my life im hit hard hit
 that girls image is engraven upon my heart i tell you  its stamped

     oh bosh  but which ones image tom 

   why-oh no matter but jove shes divine then my com-
 panion gazed out of the window with a rapt expression which once i saw it
 precluded any attempt on my part to draw him back to things mundane and
 material meanwhile the dar passed away and strangest of happenings
 the train arrived at the station of our destination on schedule time we
 sought the fonda and found it a one storied structure of adobe with only
 four rooms all  the ground floor the landlord was dirtyand greasy as
 well as insolent and seemed to take a malicious satisfaction in telling us that
 all his best rooms had been engaged by a cuban gentleman for himself and
 daughters but we were welcome to a bench apiece in the kitchen though
  more than that he could not promise

    tell him to go to thunder with the kitchen bench exclaimed tom in
 great heat of righteous indignation but that instant he caught sight of our
 friends the cubans just entering the hotel and a vast change came over his
 wrathful countenance say old man theyre going to stop here for the
 night jove  i thought they went along tell the landlord to give us the
 bench-whatever he will perhaps well get a chance to speak with them
 after all  who knows   

     but alas tliej at once disappeared and were invisible until the morning
 having their meals sent to their rooms as for us we spent a wakeful night
n

a cuban hold up

 two liard benches without either blankets or mattresses and at daylight
were only too glad to go out into the open air to escape the fleas and to
stretch our aching limbs it was with great difficulty that i restrained tom
from making an assault upon our surly boniface and finally got him into
the diligencia which was in waiting

   even yet when all was ready to start we regarded the doorway of thefonda
expectantly hoping against hope for the reappearance of yesterdays travel-
ing companions and at the last moment out walked the dignified cuban
gentleman-but alone  he climbed into the coach the driver cracked
his whip the mules strained at the harness and we were off without even
so much as a glimpse of the senoritas

    well may i be blowed   ejaculated my companion and subsiding into
a corner didnt speak another word until-well until it happened that he had
to

   the distance to don antonios ingenio was only twenty miles and we
had covered three fourths of it when the event occurred it was an
open country all the way the weary mules were jogging listlessly along
kicking up a tremendous dust in the limestone road the old coach was
squeaking dismally on its huge leather straps and the passengers were more
or less wrapped in slumber suddenly-well as i have already alluded to
the coming attack i cannot spring it upon the reader as perhaps i should
have done dramatically  and will simply say that we were awakened by the
muzzles of two carbines thrust right under our noses  that is one was
stuck under my nose and another under my companions and glancing over
the shining barrels we saw two dark and threatening faces at their hinder
ends each highwayman had flowing whiskers and fierce mustachios a
slouched hat and a mask that half concealed his face  in fact all the proper
accessories of the typical  gentleman of the road

   each demanded at the same time and in the same tone  your money or
your life   i tried to reach around and unhitch my revolver  but there was
a simultaneous and ominous click of carbine locks and a still more dark and
deepening scowl  so i desisted and we submitted to be relieved of our purses
and our pistols which they politely but firmly insisted upon appropriating

   it may seem cowardly but we had to submit it ought to have surprised
me i suppose that the highwaymen spoke english and devoted their ex-
clusive attention to tom and myself but at that moment nothing seemed
strange and i should have thought it perfectly natural if they had spoken in
greek or hebrew perhaps we were paralyzed at the suddenness of the
attack  perhaps we lacked grit let that be as it may seem  the fact was
that we were being held up in the most approved fashion

   after having gathered in our money and revolvers the highwaymen
requested us to get out of the coach and to mount two spare horses which at
this juncture an assistant led into view and all this time our cuban friend
was not only unmolested but treated with apparent deference by the bandits
neither was anybody else in the coach disturbed nor any plunder taken
away

   after we had descended to the ground and mounted our steeds the
a cuban hold up	

treacherous driver cracked his whip the mules started into a trot and soon
the whole outfit was lost to view in a cloud of dust  the distinguished aud
dignified cuban waved his hand just before he disappeared as though to bid
us farewell and we shook our fists in return promising ourselves that we
would get even with him if in the orderings of providence our paths ever
crossed again

    the scurvy scoundrel   muttered tom  i remember he said to you
that there was no danger and advised us to put our revolvers out of sight i
see his motive now  he was in league with these rascals

    no doubt of it i rejoined recalling several suspicious expressions i
should mention perhaps that while there were but two principal performers
in this sad affair yet they were supported by some half a dozen other horse-
men who stood a little aloof yet ready to give assistance if desired we
were not maltreated nor even strapped to our saddles  but on each side of
us rode a well armed horseman a glint of warning in his eye and in one
hand a loaded revolver our own weapons the highwaymen had carefully
tucked into their belts where they displayed them with rather more of osten-
tation than the occasion warranted it could not be deuied that it was
a humiliating capture  and though we gnashed our teeth and vowed all sorts
of vengeance we went along peaceably in the direction indicated by our
guides close behind us rode the supernumeraries and in this order we
crossed the plain towards a range of hills when we had accomplished about
half the distance i saw the diligence not far away swinging around a circle
of which we had traversed the diameter

   our escort spoke but rarely except to warn us now and then against at-
tempting to escape they asked us where we were going and what we were
going to do when we had got there but offered no information as to their
own intentions they- did not interdict our conversing aud we had the
slight satisfaction of abusing them roundly and telling each other what we
would do when  got our liberty etc they paid no attention to our
ravings save to smile exasperatingly showing the whitest of teeth

   at last after an hours riding we reached the summit of the hill towards
which we had been aiming and found it to be in the midst of a vast estate
surrounded on all sides bj fields of sugar cane the tall chimneys of an
ingenio stood out black against the sky not far away and near it was the
dwelling of the proprietor set in the midst of gardens aud groves of fruit
trees on the hilltop where we halted was a hut of palm leaves so thickly
thatched that it appeared more like a heap of wind drifted trash than an arti-
ficial shelter it had an aperture at one side for a door but was devoid of
windows an old negro came out of the hut as we rode up and saluted us
respectfully and after the rear guard had formed around us we were com-
manded to dismount

   breakfast is ready gentlemen said the old man as he stood aside
while we filed into the hut there in the dim light we saw a long table
loaded with a substantial repast it was not a hilarious party which
gathered around the primitive board but there was no mistaking the hos-
pitable intent of our hosts after the meal was over coffee and cigarettes
	a cuban hold up

                 

were brought in to which every one present helped himself except the two
highwaymen who had captured us they had not indeed eaten or drunk at
all but without even removing their masks had sat opposite their captives
keenly alert to their ever movement they seemed very much relieved
when breakfast was over and hastily led the way outside

   you will remain here they said to us as we were about to mount
we will take your horses along but the hut the negro and all there is
here are very much at your service you must give your parole however
that you will not attempt to follow us nor to escape until the sun has sunk
below the crest of yonder hill

     but our revolvers   i interposed  you may keep our purses but we
should like our weapons back  

   on the contrary rejoined one of the pair we shall return your
purses and retain the revolvers we do not intend to place weapons in your
hands to use against us you are such brave men you knowyou might do
something rash who knows but you might try to sliootus with this
parthian dart of affront they tossed us our purses and rode away with their
friends leaving us at the huts door watching them gloomily as they sped
down the hill

   we hadnt minded much the loss of our purses since each of us had a
wad of bills stowed away in an inside pocket and a belt cramed full of
american eagles but it would certainly have done us a world of good to
have had a flying shot at the rascals as they went galloping down the
slctpe before they left the two principals had approached and offered us
their hands one of them saying saucily as we spurned them   oh well
the time may come when you will be glad to take them my friends if you
can  till then adios

    tom and i once left alone said but little to each other for the episode
was an arrow rankling iu each breast we could not but think that we had
acted more like cowards or fools than like the men we had thought our-
selves and hardly dared look each other in the eye but after we had lighted
our pipes and soothed ourselves with a smoke the situation did not appear so 
bad on the whole the hut was cool and comfortable a delicious breeze
was wafted up from the sugar cane and a beautiful view was spread out
around and beneath us

   tom first broke the silence do you know old man said he im
rather inclined to this spot after all if we only had a couple of hammocks
and some guns we might spend a very pleasant week here im thinking
funny though isnt it how the deuce did those fellows manage to rig up
this outfit at such short notice  and how in the fiends name came they to
bring us up here and leave us in possession  it gets me  say ask that old
nigger whose estate this is and whom he belongs to  and particularly who
our friends are

    in reply to my question the old man answered that the plantation belonged
to don antonio guzman who owned as far as we could see and much
beyond

      guzman  thunder and lightning  why thats the man we have letters
a cuban hold up



to howled tom  come on lets go down at once and set him after those
blasted thieves and murderers now weve not a minute to lose i was
equally excited but i fortunately advised sending the negro with a request
for horses so that peradventure the owner of the estate was our prospective
host we might not bring the blush of shame to his brow tom assented
finally and we were rewarded for our forbearance two hours later by the
appearance of a most courteous gentleman who informed us that he was don
antonios major domo and who was profuse in his expressions of regret that
we should have been maltreated on his masters property after him followed
two led horses in charge of our sable friend to whom as we mounted and
sped away we gave a half eagle for the enjoyment of his hospitality

   then we cantered down the hill which we had ascended under circum-
stances so entirely different and in due time arrived at don antonios door
it was then mid-afternoon and the planter the liveried servant told us was
indulging in a siesta but he had been instructed to say that the house and
all it contained was at our disposal and he would show us to our rooms we
followed him across a vast and marble tiled hall and up a broad staircase to
two cool chambers one of which was assigned to tom and the other to me

    the man threw open a jalousie and was seemingly about to depart when
my attention was attracted by a glittering and familiar object on the dressing
table the servant had halted at the doorway probably to enjoy and to
report to others my amazement  but despite his presence i allowed an em-
phatic exclamation to escape me for beyond the shadow of a doubt that
glittering object on the table was my own revolver which had been taken
from me that very morning 

    attached to the trigger guard was a card on which was written  mr
arthur imray with the compliments of a g xmas 

    and as i was hanging over it in open mouthed amaze my friend dashed
into the room holding his own revolver to which as he excitedly showed
me was attached another card with similar inscription to mine only with
 the compliments of c g

    who in the name of heaven is  c g tom demanded of the ser-
vant and i added in the same breath  who is  a g what does it
mean   

     quien sabe f  he said with a shrug and a smile that was meant to be
sly  who knows but as to the initials why they are exactly those of
my honored masters most beautiful daughters the senoritas anita and con-
staucia now if the gentlemen wish to change their clothes they will find
their valises in the wardrobes pardon me  i go to prepare a cooling drink
for your worships with that the grinning mozo disappeared leaving us
staring at each other in deep bewilderment

     tom old man i gasped sinking to a divan  were you ever buncoed
on the bowery 

     no by jove  but ill freely admit that ive been buncoed in cuba

   exactly my case tom weve been made the victims of a deep laid
scheme  

     thats evident but what kind of a scheme and who hatched it


an arithmetical puzzle

 its beyond me my dear boy  aud the only suggestion i have to make
is that we dress as soon as possible and go down for an explanation

   less than an hour later two very pale but determined young men might
have been seen descending to the hall at the foot of the grand staircase
and very near the middle of said hall they were met by a portly dignified
cuban gentleman gray haired aud white mustached with an unmistakable

haughty air- but pshaw  you must have guessed alread that he

was none other than our companion of the morning aud of yesterday
aud leauing on each arm was a ravishingly beautiful maiden garbed most
fetchingly with diamond bright eyes which were deeply dark  cheeks like

damask roses lips like cleft pomegranates and- but of course you have

guessed who they were  i say were because-well because they have
since discarded their patronymic and one is now mrs anita imray and the
other mrs constancia golding of course we didnt deserve such loveljr
prizes  in very truth we had been too much humiliated to aspire at all
but as my anita has since confided to me they felt they owed us something
for robbing us of our revolvers 

   having been educated at vassar tjrey had understood every word we said
on the train and with their papas consent resolved to resent our aspersion
of cuban women-as they chose to call it our meekness in affliction had
excited their sympathy  sympathy you know is akin to love  love was
what they wanted though perhaps they didnt know it then  and the
upshot of it was that we married the highwaywomen

 the mutiny on the flying cloud

thrilling experiences among the islands of the western pacific-the hostage chosen by the
pirates to coerce the first mate-what befell when the malays attacked
the stockade on refuge island

synopsis of chapters previously published

    the clipper sliip flying cloud captain blake commanding is en route between new york
and australia with seven passengers dr henderson his wife little child lucy and his wifes
sister sibyl stanley also mr grant a civil engineer with his wife and seven year old son percy
after crossing the line the chief mate bryce is lost overboard and ned wilson scarcely twenty
is advanced to the post while robert manners who is no older is made second officer mean-
time josh williams one of the able seamen foments discontent among the crew and one night
captain blake and manners are seized bound and placed in captivity while williams makes
clear to ned wilson that the price of the safety of the women and children among the
passengers is his promise to faithfully navigate the ship to the best of his ability for the muti-
neers

    williams proposes to put the passengers ashore on one island and the two ships officers on
another but several days elapse before land that seems suitable is sighted finally one about
six miles long is selected and the passengers are sent off iu two boats at the last moment sibyl
stanley is detained from accompanying her friends williams arguing that she must be held to
insure neds trustworthiness captain blake and manners are landed on another island and
soon afterwards the flying cloud is put in at a thirdotie having a safe harbor between tall cliffs
screening her from all observation ned while off on an exploring trip with sibyl finds a cave
containing thousands of dollars worth of gold a discovery which they determine to keep from
the knowledge of the mutineers meantime after mr grant has chanced upon the wreck of a
vessel the mermaid the party on refuge island set to work building a raft a task which is
completed satisfactorily at the end of a month

chapter xx-the rafts first voyage

the settlers on refuge island were now in a position to attack the wreck
in good earnest which they did by rigging up a pair of shears  deck
and hoisting the cargo from the ships hold and depositing it directly on the
raft alongside the cargo proved to be as had been expected a general
cargo-that is to say it consisted of more or less of almost every con-
ceivable product of a civilized country from lucifer matches up to railway
plant and machinery

   it was a very difficult matter to decide what might and what might not be
of value to the party and the result was that they eventually determined to land
the entire cargo of course only a very small portion of it would go into the
shed which they had erected  but this was a matter of  very great
moment for a great deal of it was of such a nature that rain would not ma-
terially injure it

   it took them another month to empty the wreck and then they set about
the task of breaking her up

this story began in the january issue of the argosy the three back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of jo cents


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   to break up a ship is under ordinary circumstances no very difficult
matter but as they expected that the would be dependent almost entirely
upon the wreck for the timber necessary to the construction of their little
ship they had to go carefully to work  and as it was all manual labor and as
they were very short handed they found the task one of no ordinary
difficulty

   at length however after nearly another montlts arduous toil they had
cut her down to the waters edge and there they were obliged to leave her

   hitherto they had not allowed themselves time to investigate very closely
the nature of the cargo which they had so laboriously conveyed to the shore
their chief anxiety being to secure from the wreck every scrap likely to be of
the slightest use to them before the change of the season and the break up
of the weather should render this impossible now however they had
leisure to give their booty a thorough overhaul  and this was the next task
to which they devoted themselves

   as however they were now no longer pressed for time and one man could
easily do most of what was required to be done in that way it was arranged
that dr henderson should examine the cargo as far as he could and prepare
a detailed list of the various goods and articles of which it was composed
whilst grant and nicholls should proceed in the raft on a trip of exploration
round the bay for the purpose of discovering an outlet in the reef which the
former believed to exist and if such an outlet could be found to proceed
through it and make a short trial trip to sea for the purpose of testing the
sailing qualities of the raft

   on the morning following the completion of their work of dismemberment
therefore these two tasks were taken in hand such cases and packages as
it was thought the doctor would have a difficulty in breaking open unaided
were attacked by the three men and their contents laid bare  and then grant
and nicholls got on board the raft-which was berthed at a short distance
from the beach and made thoroughly secure by being moored with the ships
smallest anchor-and hoisting her huge lateen sail cast off from the mooring
buoy and proceeded to execute a few trial evolutions preparatory to the ex-
ploration of the reef

   the mode of working the raft under sail was as has already been inti-
mated the same in principle with that in vogue among the dadrone islanders
-that is to say the vessel was sailed indifferently with either end foremost
the sail being always kept on the same side of the mast this is probably the
most simple form of craft knowu to navigating mankind

   this was the first occasion upon which it had had a fair trial and it was
found to answer admirably the raft proving to be not only so stiff as to be
absolutely uncapsizable but also remarkably fast considering her shape a
speed of six knots being got out of her unloaded and with a good fresh breeze
blowing

   as soon as the somewhat novel mode of working her had been satisfac-
torily tested the exploration of the reef was begun in earnest they cruised
along its inner edge to the southward in the first instance and discovered
several places where it would probably have been possible for them to pass out
the mutiny on the flying cloud



to sea  but iu every case the channels if indeed the were worthy of the
name were so narrow and tortuous that grant had no fancy for attempting
them unless as a last resource

   they next tried the northern side of the bay and here they were more
successful for just where the reef seemed to join the land there was a channel
of about one hundred feet in width nearly straight and trending in a north-
westerly direction with so much water iu it that the sea only broke iu one or
two places throughout its entire length this channel was all that they
could desire  for as the prevailing wind seemed to be about southwest they
were enabled to pass in and out of the bay with the sheet slightly eased off

   standing through this channel which was only about a quarter of a mile
long they soon found themselves in the open sea with a considerable amount
of swell over which the raft rode wdtli a buoyancy which was most satis-
factory to her designer

   if grant had any doubt whatever about the strength of any portion of his
novel construction it was in the transverse bracing which connected the bot-
toms of his two pontoons aud he was therefore rather anxious for the first
ten minutes or quarter of an hour after he found himself fairly in the open
sea but the bracing was found amply sufficient to give the required rigidity
and this fact once demonstrated he kept away before the wind aud coasted
along the northern shore of the island keeping at a sufficient distance from
the tremendously lofty cliffs to prevent his being becalmed

   with the wind over her quarter the raft traveled remarkably fast aud
within an hour of the time when she passed out through the channel she was
abreast of the entrance to the river-which by the way was so effectually
masked that grant actually ran past it aud arrived off a point which they
had seen from their original landing place before he became aware of the
fact

   retracing his way the engineer after a careful search found the opening
and passed into the river their course for the first two miles was dead to
windward  but the raft sailed remarkably near the wind and held her own
even better than her designer had believed to be possible-the long flat sides
of the two pontoons seeming to act the parts of leeboards preventing her
from making any perceptible leeway

   they reached the lake sailed round the islet landed there and procured
a liberal supply of fruits of various descriptions which seemed to grow more
luxuriantly and of finer flavor there than on the mainland and then embark-
ing once more made the best of their way back to the bay where they
anchored the raft and proceeded on shore in a small boat which had been
built as a sort of tender to the larger craft

   they found henderson still busy with his examination of the cargo and
grant was highly delighted with its multifarious character there were
many articles which he foresaw would be of the utmost use to them in the
construction of their little ship but perhaps the find which delighted him
most was a large circular saw

   when his eye fell upon this his vjvid imagination at once pictured it as in
operation in a mill erected upon a spot which he had already recognized as


the mutiny on the flying cloud

most suitable for the purpose  and he saw too that now they need no longer
be dependent upon the old ship timber full of bolt and treenail holes for the
timber and planking of their craft as they would be enabled with the assist-
ance of the saw to provide themselves with all the planking and indeed
timber of every description which would be necessary in their work from the
magnificent teak and other trees which grew in such abundance on the
island

chapter xxi-captain blake and manners reappear

   having now secured from the wreck every scrap which it was possible to
obtain the little party on refuge island had more leisure than they had had
since the moment of their landing  for there was now no longer any fear that
if a gale sprang up they would sustain any material loss

   true the greatest part of their work still remained to be done  but there
was no longer the same necessity for hurry that there had been whilst any
portion of the cargo remained at the mercy of wind and wave and they
therefore resolved that in future they would take matters a little more easy

   the next portion of their task consisted in the conveyance of eveything
landed from the wreck round to the islet

   the men of the party were by this time beginning to feel that of late
they had somewhat overworked themselves they needed rest and the
determined to indulge in a couple of days holiday before engaging in the
task of transhipment

   up to this time the ladies had found themselves unable to render any very
material assistance  yet they had not been altogether idle for under
dr hendersons directions and with his assistance they had succeeded iu
luring into large wicker work baskets which the doctor had very in-
geniously framed the whole of the fowls  the capture consisting of three
cocks fourteen or fifteen hens and a couple of broods of chickens with a
little careful management they now believed they need never be at a loss for
eggs or even an occasional dinner of roast fowl

   during the two days of holiday which the men permitted theniselves
henderson emplojed himself in wandering about the island gun iu hand in
search of botanical and natural history specimens  and he not only secured
several rare birds the skins of which he managed to cure but also some very
valuable medicinal plants

   grant and nicliolls on the other hand chose to devote their time to a
further and more complete examination of the island the result being that
they discovered a very much more suitable site for the shipbuilding yard than
the one already fixed upon-a spot which though somewhat further away
from the spot where they had intended to build their house was much more
secure and less liable to discovery by an enemy should such unhappily make
his appearance

   nothing worthy of mention occurred during these two days and on the
morning of the third work was once more resumed with a will the task of
reloading the raft proved as had been anticipated a somewhat laborious one
the mutiny on the flying cloud

tlieir first idea had been that instead of discharging on the beach it would
be better to convey the goods direct from the wreck round to the islet the
loss of time which this would involve seemed to them sc serious that rather
than incur it and the risk which might possibly result therefrom they ligd
decided to put up with the inconvenience and the extra labor of an additional
handling of all their goods

   the real value of the raft and the wisdom which had suggested her con-
struction now became apparent for she made two and sometimes three trips
a day between the west bay and grant island as they had named their islet
home with loads averaging about ten tons on each trip

   the daj at length arrived when this part of their task drew so near its
completion that they expected to finish the transfer before evening  and on
this particular day the experienced a most agreeable surprise

   as the raft with grant and nicholls on board was running down with
its last load nicholls caught sight of what he took to be a tiny sail in the
offing to the northward to which he drew grants attention

   the latter who usually carried his telescope with him at once brought
the instrument to bear upon the object and found that nicholls was right 
and it was indeed a sail

   the craft a very small one was some four miles to leeward when first
descried and notwithstanding the loss of time which such a step would
involve the engineer promptly bore up to examine it

   as the two craft closed with each other it was seen that the small sail was
heading in for the island and a few minutes later she was made out to be an
outrigger canoe with two persons on board

   her construction was of so primitive a character that grant naturally ex-
pected to find that the persons on board her were natives who had possibly
been blown off the land and failing to make their own island again had
perhaps been wandering aimlessly about the ocean for many days what
was his surprise then when he observed one of the individuals rise in the
canoe and lift something to his shoulder the movement being followed by a
flash a little puff of smoke and the faint report of a gun

   keeping his glass fixed upon the canoe grant next  observed that the
individual who had fired tjie gun was gesticulating violently the gesticula-
tions being such as to convey the idea of rejoicing

   a few minutes later the raft was so close to the canoe that the engineer
almost doubting the evidence of his senses was able to identify the two per-
son in the latter as none other than captain blake and young manners

   at the proper moment the raft was rounded to the canoe shot alongside
and captain blake closely followed by young manners with the canoes
painter in his hand sprang upon the raft and gave grant a hearty hand grasp

  my dear fellow he exclaimed how are you and you too
nicholls my lad-i did not expect to seejyou here  how are you my good
fellow well mr grant he continued  this is the happiest day i have
known since the mutiny i am heartily glad to meet you once more sir and
to see you looking so well and how-with a slight show of hesitation-
 how are the rest of your party  


the mutiny on the flying cloud

    all perfectly well thank you  aud as happy as can reasonably be ex-
pected under the circumstances answered grant  but where on earth
have you come froifi   he continued   and how did you manage to effect
your escape from the flying cloud f 

    we have come from a bit of an island away yonder one hundred miles
or so to the eastward of the spot where we now are and we did not escape
from the flying cloud at all sir-john blake is not the sort of man to volun-
tarily desert his ship as long as she will hang together or float with him -no 
we were simply shoved ashore by those scoundrels of mutiheers aud left to
shift for ourselves as best we might and a precious poor shift it would have
been i can tell you but for ned who-fine fellow that he is-managed some-
how to scrape together for us not only a fair supply of food but also arms a
few tools aud nails enough to knock that bit of a canoe together he gave
us the exact position of your island and told us that we might possibly get a
sight of the top of yonder mountain on a clear day-which as a matter of
fact we did once or twice-so that i knew exactly how to steer and so you
are all in good health eh well i am delighted to hear tliau and where
are the rest of your party  it will be a pleasant sight for my eyes when they
rest upon the ladies and those dear children once more-bless their innocent
little hearts  

   you shall see them in good time-in the course of two or three hours-
as soon as we have landed our cargo aud can work back to the western end of
the island where our camp is at present located answered grant with a
smile but tell me he continued  before our conversation drifts away
from the subject where and how is miss stanley  

     she is-or was when i saw her last-on board the flying cloud  
answered the skipper you must understand that i was landed from the
ship on the day following that on which they put you ashore here  so i know
nothing whatever about what may have happened to her since then but
the let me wish her good by before i was landed and i had a few minutes
conversation with her  and from what passed- then and in a chat i previously
had with ned i am in hope that she is as safe as a girl can be in the hands of
such a set of ruffians but at best her situation is a very terrible one and i
would give my right hand this moment to see hqj safe once more among us
and now tell me what have you been doing all the time and what is the
meaning of this raft and her cargo  

   grant iu reply gave a pretty fully detailed account of all that they had
done and of their future plans  winding up by expressing the exceeding sat-
isfaction he felt that the little party would now be benefited by the aid and
advice of two such valuable auxiliaries as the skipper aud young manners

   captain blake listened most attentively to everything the engineer told
him-the raft meanwhile being worked to windward toward the harbors
mouth-and when he had heard everything he remarked 

    well so far you have done admirably  i do not believe matters could
have been managed better had i been here myself and as to this raft of
yours-if raft you call her-she is simply a wonder  why she turns to wind-
ward like a racing cutter i am sure  should never have dreamed of
the mutiny on the flying cloud



 scheming out anything half so handy you engineers are very clever people
 there is  denying that and can even give an old salt like myself a wrinkle
 now and then as i have learned from today but now to say a word or two
 about the future you tell me that this is your last cargo and that on your
 next trip you propose to transfer all hands to this bit of an islet that lies away
 inland there somewhere now let me ask you have you had any craft of
 any description prowling about iu the neighborhood lately   

      we have not sighted a sail of any description since we saw the flying
 clouds canvas sink below yonder horizon answered grant pointing to the
 eastward

     so much the better said the skipper and i am right glad to hear
 it these waters as you  a perhaps know are not often traversed by the
 craft of civilized nations  indeed so far as i can make out we are quite out
 of ah the regular ship tracks but manners and i have been alarmed on two
 or three occasions on our own island yonder by the appearance of proas-a
 class of craft which i may tell you are usually manned by malays or sav-
 ages of a somewhat similar race and character  and if any such should come
 prying about here they will certainly beat up our quarters and give s no end
 of trouble indeed to speak the whole truth my dear fellow i would as
 soon be in the hands of a crew of mutineers as in theirs so if you will
 listen to  advice our first job should be the building of a house large
 enough to accommodate all hands  and if possible it should be so fortified as
  to enable us to hold out with some chance of success against such an attack
 as those fellows would be likely to make in the event of their looking in here 

chapter xxii-a new aearm

    the captains warning was news indeed the gravity and importance of
 which it would be difficult to overestimate grant already knew something
 of the malays by reputation  and he was aware that captain blake was
 speaking no more than the truth when he asserted that the party would be
 certainly no worse off in the hands of the mutineers than they would be in
 those of a horde of malay pirates whose calling only fosters their natural
 propensity for rapine and bloodshed

    he had heard one or two perfectly hideous stories of atrocities committed
 by those wretches when unfortunate ships crews had fallen into their hands
 and he shuddered and his blood ran cold as his vivid imagination pictured
 the women and children of the party in the hands and at the mercy of such a
 band

     in this as in every other case of difficulty or danger the safety and welfare of
 the women and children would naturally be the first consideration  and grants
 first mental question was how would they be affected by these tidings it
 was true he reflected that the proas might not visit the island  but as it
 was evident that they were cruising in the neighborhood it would be the
 height of folly to rely upon chance in such a matter and he forthwith
 began to turn over iu his mind what wtould be the best steps to take in the
 emergency


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   it would be possible for the weaker members of the party to find conceal-
ment somewhere among the spurs of the mountain  but any such arrange-
ment as this whilst highly inconvenient would be open to many other disad-
vantages and grant could not help thinking of what their fate would be
supposing that whilst lying thus concealed the men of the party should be
attacked and made captive or slain were such a catastrophe as this to befall
them the fate of those poor women and children would be little better than a
living death  left as they would be to shift for themselves unaided unpro-
tected and their hearts wrung with anguish for the loss of those to whom
they were naturally in the habit of looking for help and protection and with
little or no chance of ultimate escape from their island prison

   to add to the difficulties of the situation the little part were so short
handed that to construct such a fortified habitation as blake had suggested
would be if not an absolute impossibility a work of such time and labor that
for all practical purposes it might as well be unattempted

   this was no case of ordinary difficulty  it was not a difficulty which
could be overcome by the skilful and judicious application of a practically
unlimited supph of manual labor and almost for the first time in his life
the engineer found himself confronted with a question which he was unable
to satisfactorily answer

                                                                                       

   whilst the engineer was still revolving this difficult matter in his mind
the raft arrived at her usual berth at grant island and her cargo was as
rapidly as possible discharged  after which she sailed at once for the western
settlement

   here the unexpected appearance of captain blake and rob manners was
greeted with every manifestation of surprise and delight  and the former had
as a matter of course to recount to his interested friends the whole story of
his sojourn upon and escape from the island upon which the pair had been
landed

   the ladies were naturally most anxious to learn the latest news concern-
ing miss stanley and the wary skipper whilst telling them what little he
knew about her did his best to allay their fears with regard to that young
lady carefully concealing his own somewhat gloomy anticipations as to her
future and so successfully did he manage this business that mrs
hendersons heart was considerably lightened of the load which had for so
long a time been secretly pressing upon it

   as soon as it could be done without exciting suspicion in the minds of the
ladies grant contrived upon one pretext or another to draw away all the
male members of the party to whom forthwith he disclosed the alarming
intelligence which captain blake had brought to the island with him  point-
ing out to them the new danger which thus threatened the very existence of
them all and earnestly begging them to give the matter their most serious
consideration

   suggestions were of course at once offered in plenty but they all pos-
sessed one very serious drawback  they lacked practicability

   the least unpromising of them all was that of captain blake who
boldh advocated the abandonment of the scheme for building a vessel and
the mutiny on the flying cloud



proposed that instead of incurring the delay and risk involved in the carry-
ing out of such a plan the raft should first be strengthened as much as
possible and that he manners and nicholls should then sail in her to
singapore from whence it would be easy to dispatch a rescue vessel to the
island to take off the rest of the party

   but when this proposal came to be canvassed more in detail it was found
that there were several verj grave objections to it the most grave of them
all lying in the fact that according to their calculations the stormy season
must now be close at hand  and strengthen the raft as much as they would
or could grant believed that if she happened to be caught in a hurricane
nothing could prevent her going to pieces

   moreover singapore was well to windward of the island they were then
upon and though the raft did very fairly upon a taut bowline in fine
weather aud in a moderate sea grant expressed very grave doubts as to how
she would behave in a strong breeze and a heavy sea

   then again the absence of the skipper manners and nicholls would
reduce the defensive strength of those left behind to two men only and that
too without any artificial protection save such as their united strength might
enable them to throw up

   on the whole after canvassing the question thoroughly it was decided
that the skippers plan was very much too risky for adoption under the then
existing circumstances of the party and they eventually came to the conclu-
sion that no better course seemed open to them than to carry out grants
original idea-namely the construction of a house which should be strong
enough to serve also as a fort in case of need

   the next point to be decided was of what material should the house be
constructed  of timber of a suitable character there was a superabundance
upon the island  nay even on the islet itself there was more than sufficient
for their purpose but it would have to be cut sawn to the required dimen-
sions and hauled to the site of the building before it could be made use of 
and all this involved a great deal of labor to say nothing of the fact that
when finished the structure could easily be destroyed by fire

   grant was strongly of opinion that stone was the most suitable material
for the purpose  but unfortunately he was by no means certain that a
quarry could be found in a convenient position and at a convenient distance
for transportation if it could he believed that shells in sufficient quantities
for the manufacture of lime could easily be collected on the beach  and he
had no doubt as to his ability to construct a kiln in which to burn them

   as the engineer warmed with his subject he made the superiority of stone
over wood so evident that it was finally decided he and henderson should
devote the next day to a search for a suitable quarry whilst the skipper with
manners and nicholls for his assistants was to essay the task of knocking up
a temporarj but somewhat more efficient shelter for the party than the tents
would afford pending the completion of the house or  fort as they seemed
inclined to style the proposed structure

   in accordance with this arrangement immediately after breakfast next
morning the tents were struck and placed on board the raft and the ladies
ijo

the mutiny on the flying cloud

and children also embarked in her to proceed round to grant island in charge
of captain blake and his two assistants  whilst the engineer and henderson
armed with their repeating rifles and an axe each in their belts set out in
company for the gap in the cliffs their intention being to proceed overland
and to separate at the head of the river each taking one of its banks with
the object of ascertaining whether any suitable quarry site could be found in
a situation convenient for the shipment of stone on board the raft

   the quest occupied the two friends for the greater part of the day they
arriving abreast the islet within half an hour of each other and reaching its
friendly shores just in time to assist the working party there in putting the
finishing touches to quite a respectable structure-half tent half bower-for
which the skipper had acted the part of architect

   the house or shelter rather for it was too rough and ready an affair to
be worthy of the former appellation was really a very creditable production-
roomy and watertight though it was doubtful whether it would prove capable
of withstanding the buffeting of a hurricane-and captain blake was very
justly proud of it

   on comparing notes it was found that both the explorers had been success-
ful in their search both had found stone of a more or less suitable quality
some of it indeed being excellent  but the honors of the day fell to the
doctors lot he having not only discovered a quarry site in a most convenient
situation with stone of a quality far superior to anything that grant had met
with but also an outcrop of coal

   this discovery was of infinitely greater value to the party situated as thy
then were than would have been the finding of a gold mine and grant inparticu-
lar-who perhaps realized more fully than any of the others the exceeding
importance of the discovery-was greatly elated thereat

   full alive to the importance of developing these new resources without
delay the five men started in the raft at daybreak next morning well pro-
vided with picks shovels crowbars sledges and such other implements as it
was thought might be useful together with a keg of powder from the maga-
zine of the mermaid and made their way up stream henderson acting as
pilot

   the quarry was first reached being situated only about half a mile above
grant island and a single glance sufficed to satisfy the refugees that here was
stone not only of superior quality but amply sufficient iti quantity for every
possible want of the party the quarry face consisted of an almost perpen-
dicular cliff of gray limestone springing out of the soil at a distance of only
some fifty feet from the margin of the stream  it was about thirty feet in
height and fully one hundred and fifty feet long

   captain blake and nicholls landed here provided with the powder and
such tools as they needed and instructed by the engineer-who promised to
rejoin them as soon as he had inspected the coal output-began at once to lay
bare the stone at the top of the cliff

   the rest of the party then proceeded in the raft to the  coal mine as
they already began to term it which they found about a quarter of a mile
further on the outcrop proved as henderson had asserted to be genuine
the mutiny on the flying cloud

coal and of very fair quality too with a prospect of it improving as it was
worked down into  and most important and fortunate for the discoverers it
like the stone was situated close to the river bank near enough in fact to
permit of its being loaded direct on the deck of the raft by means of a long
wooden chute

   the doctor and young manners willingly undertook to get such coal as
might be required-not a very large quantity in all probability-and strip-
ping to the waist at once set to work whilst grant made his way to
the quarry on the raft

   on rejoining the skipper and nicholls the engineer found that the two
men had worked to such excellent purpose that they had already laid bare an
area of some forty feet of stone and disclosed a small fissure which
grant thought would serve admirably to receive a blasting charge which
he at once proceeded to prepare

   this operation was soon accomplished the fuse-a chemical preparation
 made up  by henderson the night before-was lighted and the trio hastily
retreated to a place of safety

   a minute later a faint boom was heard followed by a tremendous crash
and the rattle of falling fragments  and hurrying back to the spot the
workers found that by a lucky accident the charge had been so placed as to
dislodge and hurl down on to the bank beneath upwards of twenty tons of
stone

   after this there was no further difficult for the layers happened to so
run that a very little labor with the bars sufficed to send the stone down on
to the bahk ready for loading  and when any especial difficulty was ex-
perienced a small quantity of powder always proved sufficient to overcome
it such capital progress indeed did they make that in less than a month
they had not only quarried but had actually transferred to the islet as much
stone as it was thought they would require

   by that time a very fair quantity of coal was also ready for removal  and
when this important task was accomplished a kiln was built and grant him-
self undertook the manufacture of lime henderson and the skipper pro-
ceeded to erect a shed for its storage nicholls meanwhile essaying the task
of putting up a smithy on the site of the future ship yard

   but before they were ready to begin their building operations in earnest
the long expected change in the weather-or rather the change of the
seasons-had come upon them and their work was somewhat retarded by the
setting in of heavy rains accompanied by terrific thunderstorms and occasional
heavy gales of wind

chapter xxiii-the skipper goes a fishing

   the violent atmospheric disturbances which accompanied the change of
the seasons lasted about a month after which the weather became tolerably
settled once more though rain now fell more or less heavily every day

   to work out of doors in the midst of pelting rain was by no means
pleasant although there was no perceptible variation in the usual tempera-


the mutiny on the flying cloud

ture of the climate still there existed in the breasts of all so strong a feel-
ing of insecurity so long as the fort  remained unbuilt that they deter-
mined rather to suffer the unpleasantness of being daily drenched to the skin
than to protract the uneasy feeling of defeuselessness which haunted them

   the building then was pushed forward with all possible expedition and
thanks to the indefatigable energy with which they labored was so far
finished as to be habitable within a couple of mouths of its commencement
though of course a great deal still remained to be done before it could be
regarded as absolutely secure

   the site for this house or fort-for when finished it really was strong-
enough to merit the latter name-wras finally fixed so as to include within its
limits a spring of pure fresh water-an adjunct of the utmost importance if
it should ever fall to the lot of the occupants to be placed in a state of siege
and it possessed the further advantage of completely commanding both the
land and water approaches to the proposed ship yard

   it was built in the form of a hollow square inclosing a small courtyard
which the ladies determined to convert into a garden at the earliest oppor-
tunity with the spring in its center one side of the house was set apart
for the purpose of a general living room  the two contiguous sides were
divided unequally-the larger divisions forming respectively the doctors and
the engineers sleeping rooms while the smaller divisions served as kitchen
and larder  and the fourth side afforded ample sleeping accommodation for
the remainder of the party with a store room in one angle of the building
and the magazine and armory in the other

   the windows all looked outward but -were small and strongly defended
with stout iron bars built into the masonry and with massive wood shutter
inside loopholed for rifle firing the doors giving access to the rooms all
opened upon the courtyard aud were as high and wide as they could be
made so as to let in plenty of light and air	

   for still further security there was no doorway whatever in the exterior
face of the buildiug egress and ingress being possible only by means of a
staircase in the courtyard leading up on to the flat roof aud thence down on
the outside by means of a light bamboo ladder which could be hauled up on
the roof in case of need

   the roof or roofs rather had only a very gentle slope or fall inward just
sufficient to allow of the rain flowing off and afforded a fighting platform at
a height of about fourteen feet from the ground the defenders being sheltered
by the exterior walls which were carried up five feet and also loopholed

   it seemed at first sight a great waste of labor to build so strong a place as
this for what the refugees hoped would be a comparatively brief sojourn but
as grant pointed out to them there was no knowing precisely how long their
stay on the island might be protracted aud if they were going to construct a
defense at all it -was as well whilst they were about it to build something 
which should effectually serve its purpose

   and after all when the work came to be undertaken it was found that it
took but little if any longer time than would have been required to put up a
wooden house and to surround it with an effective palisade
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   another month saw the fort so far completed that grant thought he might
now safely take in hand the saw mill upon which he had set his mind and he
aijd the skipper accordingly devoted themselves henceforward to that under-
taking finishing it within a few days of the date when henderson reported
that all was done at the fort which at that time was deemed necessary

   the doctor and his party now took to the woods armed with their axes
and began the important task of selecting and felling the timber for the pro-
posed boat the design for which grant had been diligently working upon
whenever he could find a spare hour or two to devote to the purpose

   as ultimately worked out this design was for a cutter to be of twelve feet
beam forty feet long on the load water line and of such a depth as would not
only afford comfortable head room in the cabins but also give the craft a good
hold of the water and make her very staunch and seaworthj

   these dimensions it was considered were sufficient for perfect seaworthi-
ness whilst the various timbers would be light enough to permit of their
being handled and placed in position with comparative ease with the limited
power at their command the greatest care was exercised in the selection of
the timber it being necessary to choose not only that which was thoroughly
sound but also such as could without very much labor be conveyed to the saw
mill

   this latter necessity or rather the actual labor of conveying the timber to
the mill caused their progress to be somewhat less rapid than they had an-
ticipated especially as nicholls was now busily engaged at the smithy pre-
paring the bolts fastenings and other ironwork for the little craft but not-
withstanding all the work advanced with fairly satisfactory rapidity

   it had been decided that the whole of the timber should be cut sawn and
stacked in the ship yard before even the keel blocks were laid down so that
it might become at least partially seasoned before being worked into the hull
and this was accomplished in rather less than a couple of months

   at length the day arrived when everything being ready the keel of the
vessel was to be laid down-a task which the keel piece being cut out of one
log it took the little band an entire day to accomplish satisfactorily and it
was  the evening of this particular day or rather during the ensuing night
that the little colony sustained a loss which plunged its members into grief so
deep that its shadow never entirely left them until long after the termination
of their sojourn upon the island

   it happened thus  during the numerous passages of the raft to and fro
between the west bay and grant island a small reef had been discovered some
six miles north of the main island upon which reef it had been further dis-
covered a certain fish of peculiarly delicate and agreeable flavor was to be
caught between the hours of sunset and sunrise so very delicious had this
particular species of fish been found that it had become quite a custom for
one or more of the men to take the raft after the days work was over and go
off to the reef for an hour or twos fishing thus combining business and
pleasure in a most agreeable manner

   captain blake especially always partook of the fish with exceptional
relish  and it happening at this time that all hands had been too busily
r

the mutiny on the flying cloud

occupied for any of them to go out for several days past the skipper thought
he would celebrate so momentous an occasion as the laying of the keel by a
few hours fishing upon the reef

   accordingly as the evening meal was approaching completion he
announced his intention at the same time inquiring if any of the others felt
disposed to join him all however confessed themselves to be too tired to
find pleasure in anything short of a good nights rest and the skipper there-
fore departed alone henderson calling out after him as he went 

   dont go to sleep and fall overboard captain and keep a sharp eye
upon the weather to my mind the wrind seems inclined to drop and if it
does it will probably shift and i suppose you have noticed that heavy
cloud bank working up there to the westward   

    ay ay ive noticed it answered the skipper good humoredly but
slightly derisive at what he considered the presumption of a landsman in
thinking it necessary to caution him about the weather   another thunder-
storm i take it-they always work up against the wind  but i shall be back
again and safe in my bunk before it breaks good night   

chapter xxiv-the captains dream

   captain blake strolled down to the tiny cove in which the punt was
moored cast off the painter and paddled out to the raft which rode at a buoy
anchored about fifty yards distant from the beach

    arriving alongside the raft he made fast the punts painter to the buoy
loosed the crafts triangular sail mastheaded the yard by means of a small
winch nicholls had fitted for the purpose cast off his moorings and began to
work down the stream seaward the wind being against him

   he was not long in reaching the open water and as he shot out between
the two headlands which guarded the mouth of the harbor he noticed with
satisfaction that the cloud bank to which henderson had warningly directed
attention had already completely risen above the horizon and was slowly
melting away

   true the atmosphere was somewhat hazy and the breeze was less steady
than usual but the general aspect of the sky was promising enough and if
a change of weatlier was impending it would not the skipper told himself
occur for several hours yet or without giving him sufficient warning to enable
him to regain the island in good time

   arrived on the reef-over which by the way there was plenty of water
four fathoms being the least the party had ever found upon it-the expectant
sportsman anchored lowered the sail and threw his lines overboard

   the sport however was not by any means good that night for it was
fully half an hour before he got a bite  and the interval which followed his
first capture was so long that the skippers interest waned and his thoughts
wandered off-as indeed they very often did-to his ship he fell to won-
dering what had become of her whether the mutineers had actually gone to
the extreme length of canning into effect their piratical plans whether sibyl
and ned wrere still on board and if so how matters fared with them
the mutiny on the flying cloud



     he was full of commiseration for the two young people both having taken
  a strong hold upon his warm and kindly heart and he scarcely knew which to
  pity more-whether sibyl cruelly and perhaps permanently cut off from all
  intercourse with her own sex and constantly in association with a band of
   lawless men  or ned likewise a prisoner with all his lifes prospects blighted
  and in addition to this the never ceasing care anxiety and watchfulness which
  he must endure on sibyls account

     most people would have been disposed to say unhesitatingly that the girls
  lot was infinitely the worse of the two but the skipper did not  he under-
  stood pretty wrell or thought he did the position of affairs on board the
  flying cloud  and he knew to absolute certainty that so long as ned had
  life and strength to protect her sibyl was reasonably secure

     but ned he repeated to himself would always have her safety and well
  being upon his mind in addition to his other cares and anxieties it was a
  miserable plight for both of them he mused and he didnt see how they were
  to get out of it-unless indeed they could manage to steal away in a boat
  and give them the slip some fine dark night

     and what would become of them then  the captain asked himself what
 chance of ultimate escape would they have  he knew ned well enough to
 feel assured he would never attempt so extreme a step without first making
 the fullest provision for the safety of his companion and himself  but when
 all was done what prospect would they have of being picked up in those seas 

     he pictured them to himself drifting helplessly hither and thither
 exposed to the scorching rays of the sun all day and the pelting rain at
 night their provisions consumed their water breaker empty and hope
 slowly giving way to despair as day and night succeeded each other with no
 friendly sail to cheer their failing sight and drive away the horrible visions
 which haunt those who are perishing of hunger and thirst

    he saw neds stalwart form grow gaunt and lean and sibyls rounded
 outlines sharpen and waste away under the fierce fires of hunger and his
 soul sickened within him as their moans of anguish smote upon his ear
 and at last he heard sibyl in her agony and despair entreat ned to take
 away the life which had become a burden to her and he saw and heard too
 how ned his speech thick and inarticulate with torturing thirst first tried
 uuavailingly to soothe and comfort and encourage the suffering girl  and
 how at last in sheer pity for her and her mad desperation at their hopeless
 state the lad drew forth his knife and stealthily tested the keenness of its
 edge and point

     and as he watched with feverish interest yet unspeakable anxiety and
  horror he saw that the long protracted suffering had at last proved too much
  for the poor lad and that his brain was giving way  for look  the baleful
  light of madness gleams in his bloodshot eyes  madness gives new strength
  to his nerveless limbs as he rises and bends over his companion the blade
  quivers and flashes in the sunlight and captain blake-with a cry of horror
  starts forward-to awake at the sound of his own voice and to find himself at
  the edge of the raft in the very act of leaping into the jaws of a shark
  which is eyeing him hungrily from the water alongside 
the mutiny on the flying cloud

   he luckily checks his spring in tixne to seize the boat hook and strike
savagely at the waiting shark with its point follows as a matter of course 
and then the skipper returns thanks not only for his escape but also that the
events he had just been witnessing are nothing more than an ugly dream

   blakes next act is to haul in the lines which have dropped from his
nerveless hands during sleep and which would unquestionably have been
lost had he not taken the precaution to make them fast and he finds to his
chagrin that not only the bait but also the hooks have been carried off

   he therefore neatly coils up his fishing tackle preparatory to shaping a
course for home  for the moon is on the verge of the western horizon and he
knows therefore that it is past midnight

   moreover though the breeze is rather fresher than it was and the horizon
is clear there is a murkiness in the atmosphere overhead which portends a
change of weather and as he looks knowingly about him he gives audible
expression to his opinion that there will be but little work done in the ship
yard on the morrow

chapter xxv-a strange sail

   the grapnel is lifted and the skipper attaching the handle to the winch
begins to masthead the yard of the solitary sail which propels the raft as
he does so his eyes are directed towards the moon now slowly sinking beneath
the horizon

   ha  what is that

   the labor at the winch is suspended a hasty turn is taken with the
halyard and captain blake strains forward his eyes shaded by both hands
the better to observe that black spot which is slowly gliding athwart the
moons pale face

    tittle need is there though for him to look so intently to ascertain what
that black spot really is  it is more for the purpose of assuring himself that
his eyes are not playing him false or that he is not once more the victim of a
dream no  this is not a dream he is wide awake enough now and his
mind is busy with a thousand tumultuous thoughts for as he watches clear
and unmistakable glide the upper sails of a large ship across the face of the
sinking planet

    she is steering south but whether easterly or westerly it is impossible to
say as she stands out silhouette-like against her golden background  but one
thing is plain-she is moving very slowly

   the skipper darts to the compass-one of a pair saved from the wreck of
the mermaid-and striking a match which he carefully shelters from the
wind in the crown of his cap he manages to take her bearing before she
vanishes from his sight

    he next completes the setting of his sail hauls aft the sheet and jamming
the raft close upon the wind asks himself what is the best thing to do

   to return to the island will consume an hour of most precious time  and
when there what could he do to attract the strangers attention nothing
more than light a huge bonfire  and the only spot suitable for this is the
the mutiny on the flying cloud



western side of the mountain to reach which will consume at least another
half hour then there would be wood to collect occupying say another half
hour making a total of at least two hours and a half before such a signal
could be rendered visible

   and perhaps after all those onboard the ship might not see it or seeing
it might not understand its meaning-might suppose it to be nothing more
than a fire built by the natives and so pass on their way

   no  that would not do-the risk of failure would be too great

   what then there remained nothing in captain blakes opinion but to
pursue the stranger

   she could not he thought be going more than five knots judging by the
strength of the breeze and the momentary glimpse of her  whilst the raft
light as she was and with the wind well over her quarter would go nearly or
quite seven

   the strange sail was about twelve miles off  therefore if he could over-
haul her at the rate of about two knots an hour he ought to be near enough
to attract her attention by sunrise

   but he must bear up in chase at once there was no time to waste in
running ashore to make known his intentions  and as for help he wanted
none liewtas quite able to manage the raft single handed moreover he
began to suspect that henderson would prove to be right in that suggestion
of his respecting a change of weather wdiich made it all the more important
that the strange sail should be overhauled before the change should occur

   these reflections passed through the skippers brain in a single moment-
not perhaps quite so definitely as here set forth but to the same purpose-and
in the next he jammed his helm hard up eased off the sheet and bore away
upon a course which he conjectured would enable him to intercept the
stranger

   for a few minutes after the disappearance of the moon blake was able or
fancied he was able still to distinguish the canvas of the chase looming up
vaguely like a dark shapeless shadow upon the horizon  but either the sk
grew darker in that quarter or the weather thickened for he was soon obliged
to admit that he could seen it no longer

   but that circumstance gave him not the least concern  he had set his
course by a star and he knew that so long as he continued to steer for it so
long would the course of the raft converge toward that of the stranger

   he was concerned however to notice later  that not only was the
weather thickening overhead necessitating a frequent changing of the star
by which he was following his course but also that the wind was becoming
unsteady sometimes it fell away to such an extent as to cause the rafts sail
to flap heavily as she rolled over the ridges of the swell and anon breezed up
quite fresh again but with a change of perhaps a couple of points in its
direction the change generally being of such a character as to bring the wrind
forward more on his starboard beam

   gradually the haze so thickened overhead that such stars as were not
already obscured grew dim and soon disappeared altogether leaving the soli-
tary man dependent only upon the somewhat fickle wind for a guide by which


the mutiny on the flying cloud

to steer his course  for though he had a compass on board the raft he had
no binnacle aud no lamps by which to illuminate the compass card

    it is true the island was still in sight some four miles astern but the night
had grown so dark and the atmosphere so thick that the land merely loomed
like a vast undefined blot of darkness against the black horizon being so in-
distinct indeed that only the practiced eye of a seaman could have detected
its presence at all  it was therefore almost useless as an object to steer by

   it had by this time begun to dawn upon the skipper that his adventure
was likely to prove of a far more serious character than he had at all con-
templated  and he was earnestly debating with himself the question whether
his wisest course would not after all be to abandon the chase and make the
best of his way back to the island when the breeze once more freshened up
so strongly and that too dead aft that it made everything on board the raft
surge again as she gathered way and skimmed off before it

    blake calculating that even if the chase were sailing away from instead of
toward him it would shorten his distance from her at least a couple of miles
before she caught it grimly held on his course determined to risk everything
rather than lose so good a chance  his chief fear now being that the sheet
would part under the tremendous strain brought to bear upon it by the im-
mense sail

   the raft as has been elsewhere stated was of very peculiar construction
her shape and build being such as to peculiarly favor speed especially when
running dead before the wind light as she now was she skimmed away
before the fierce squall at a rate which made blakes heart bound with exultation
as he looked first to one side and then the other and noted the furious speed
with which the phosphorescent foam from under her bows was left behind

   there was now no longer any thought of turning back for captain blake
had by this time arrived at a firm conviction first that it was by the special
intervention of providence that he had been led to undertake his fishing ex-
cursion that night and next that the freshening up of a dead fair wind just
when it did was a second special intervention of providence to prevent his
giving up the chase

   and so he held on everything and the raft rushed away dead before the
wind through the pitchy darkness the mast creaking ominously in its step
every now and then and the tautly strained gear aloft surging from time to
time in an equally ominous manner

   the sea rose rapidly-showing that the solitary voyager was fast drawing
out from under the sheltering lee of the island astern-and the foaming wave
crests vividly phosphorescent momentarily towered higher and more threat-
eningly and hissed louder and more angrily in the luminous wake of the
flying craft

chapter xxvi-the storm breaks

   the squall lasted a full hour when the wind died away even more sud-
denly than it had arisen and the raft was left tumbling about with little
more than steerage way upon her
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   the skipper had uo means of ascertaining the time it being too intensely
dark to permit of his reading the face of his watch even when it was held
close to his eyes though he made two or three unsuccessful attempts to do
so anxious and impatient as he was for the dawn he knew that it must be
at least another hour perhaps nearer two before lie could reasonably expect
its appearance

   two hours more of sickening suspense  one hundred and twenty
minutes  with the weather in such a threatening state what might not
happen in the interval 

   if he could only have obtained an occasional glimpse of the compass or if
the night had been less opaquely dark he would not have cared so much in
the one case he would have been enabled not only to keep a mental reckoning
of his own course but also that of the ship ahead and to follow her direction
uo matter how capricious the breeze  whilst in the other case he might have
stood some chance of catching a momentary glimpse of her

   as his reflection took this turn the captain stooped and looked ahead
under the foot of the sail looked more intently rubbed his eyes and looked
again

   what was it he saw  a light-lights  yes surely  it must be so or
were those faint luminous specks merely illusory and a result of the over-
straining of his visual organs due to the intensity of his gaze into the gloom 

   no  those feebly glimmering points of light were stationary  they main-
tained the same fixed distance from each other and he could count them-
one two three-half a dozen of them at least if not more  he could not be
certain for they were so very faint

   what could it mean  was there a whole fleet of ships down there to lee-
ward 

   that there was something was an absolute certainty  and as it seemed an
impossibility that it could be anything else it was only reasonable to conclude
that it must be a ship or ships

   at all events there could be no question as to the course he ought to
follow  it would be worse than folly to continue in pursuit of an invisible
ship with those lights in comparatively plain view only a couple of points on
his lee bow

   so the skipper bore away until the faint luminous spots opened out j ust
clear of the heel of the long yard there he resolutely kept them the wind
having by this time fallen so light that it was necessary for him to make fre-
quent sweeps with the steering oar in order to keep the rafts head pointed in
the required direction

   suddenly a greenish spectral radiance beamed down upon him from above 
and quickly casting a startled glance aloft blake shudderingly beheld a ball
of lambent greenish light quivering upon the upper extremity of the long
tapering yard and swaying to and fro with the roll of the raft much as the
flame of acandle would have done under similar circumstances

    clinging lightly to the end of the yard it alternately elongated and flat-
tened as the spar swayed to and fro now and then rolling a few inches down
the yard as though about to travel down to the deck but as often returning
to the extremity of the yard again


the mutiny on the flying cloud

   presently another and similar luminous ball gleamed into sliape at the
mast head swaying and wavering about the end of the spar like its com-
panion

   they wrere those strange electric fireballs known as corporsants  while
they conveyed to the skipper the only additional warning needed of the im-
pending elemental strife the also at once explained the mystery of the lights
to leeward for which he was steering those also were undoubtedly corpor-
sants glimmering from the spars of the strange sail of which he was in pur-
suit and which from her present proximity must have been steering to the
eastward and consequently toward him instead of to the westward and away
from him as he had feared

   blake believed she certainly could not be more than a mile distant his
conviction being that the feeble sickly lights of the ghostly corporsants could
not penetrate further than that distance in so thick an atmosphere it now
became of the utmost importance-nay it might even be a matter of life or
death for him-to reach the stranger before the hurricane should burst upon
them

   he looked over the side to ascertain the speed of the raft through the
water and his heart quailed as he observed that save for an occasional tiny
phosphorescent spark on the surface or a faintly luminous halo lower down in
the black depths slowly drifting by there was nothing to indicate that she had
any motion whatever

   her speed was not more than half a knot per hour  and the stranger was
probably a mile distant-twto hours away at the rafts then rate of progress 

   something must be done and quickly too  for out of the darkness round
about him there uow floated weird whispering sighs faint dismal moanings
and now and then a sudden momentary rush as of invisible wings telling that
the storm fiend was marshaling his forces and about to make his swoop

   what was to be done there were only two oars on board the raft-the
steering oars-and it would be next to impossible to use them as means of
propulsion moreover if a little puff of wind should come as is sometimes
the case before the great burst of the hurricane they would one or both be
wanted where they were

   perhaps hailing might be of use at all events blake would try and
placing his hollowed hands on each side of his mouth to form a speaking
trumpet the skipper drew a deep inspiration or two hailed with the utmost
strength of his lungs 

      ship ahoy-y   

   and then listened

   no response nothing save the faint murmurings and railings of the
gathering gale

      ship ahoy-y   

   hark  what was that  did he indeed hear a faint answering halloo
from away yonder in the direction of those weird lights or was it merely that
the wish was father to the thought 

    s-h-i-p a-hoy-y-y   

     halloo  
the mutiny on the flying cloud



   quite unmistakable tliis time  and the skipper in a perfect frenzy of ex-
citement repeats his hail time after time waiting only long enough to receive
the answer before hailing again

   presently a bright star suddenly appears under the faintly gleaming cor-
porsants it is a ships lantern held up over the rail

   a minute later a tiny spark appears close to the lantern immediately
bursting into a keen bluish glare from which a cloud of white smoke arises
and flakes of blue white flame drop now aud then as a portfire is burnt

   by its brilliant though ghostly radiance the skipper can see less than half
a mile distant a brig under nothing but close reefed main topsail and fore-
topmast staysail-evidently fully prepared for the worst that can come to her
in the shape of weather-with a little group of figures gathered about the
portfire and a small group consisting of two men only abaft the main
rigging all peeriug eagerly in his direction

   he sees one of the figures raise its arms and presently there comes float-
ing across the inky water 

    halloo there  who hails 

   the skipper again raises his hands to his mouth draws a mighty inspira-
tion aud replies as the readiest means of bringing succor 

    shipwrecked m-a-n broad-on-your-port-b-e-a-m  

   the man who had hailed waves his hand to show that he has heard  and
then the portfire burns out

   at this moment the whole firmament from zenith to horizon is rent
asunder and for a single instant the entire universe seems to have been set
on fhe by the fierce blaze of the lightning which flashes from the rent while
the accompanying thunder crash is so deafening that even the skipper sea-
soned as he is quails beneath the shock of it

   for a single instant the sea and everjtliing upon it from horizon to
horizon is illumined by a light brighter than that of day  and in that single
instant blake sees not only the brig enveloped iu a perfect network of fire
but also the huge piles of cloud overhead twisted and distorted into a
hundred fantastic shapes by the forces at work within them

   the next moment down comes the rain not in drops not even in sheets
of water but in a perfectly overwhelming deluge of such density aud volume
that blake bowing to his knees beneath it gasps and chokes like a drowning
man

   but he speedily recovers his seuses-he had need to for he will soon want
them all-and staggering to his feet makes toward the mast which with the
yard and dripping sail is now distinctly outlined against the milky back-
ground of sea milky by reason of the phosphorescence of its surface being
lashed into luminosity by the pouring rain

   he grasps the halyard of the sail and with feverish haste proceeds to cast
it adrift from its belaying pin murmuring the while

    now god be merciful to me a sinner  for i am too late the time for
rescue is past

being the true copy of an incident recorded in the diary of captain walker heywood-a rev-
olutionary episode in which cupids arrows played their part

   lthough i am aware that the occurrences which i am about to record
carried no great influence for either good or evil in the cause of ameri-
can independence and are of no special interest to the public at large yet i
am convinced that my descendants at least will enjoy reading from these
pages and will rejoice to know that in so great a national crisis as our revo-
lution their grandfather did his duty as best he could

    on the th of october  the battle of white plains was fought but
resulted in victory for neither army and general washington finding that
the position of the americans was becoming insecure issued orders for the
army to prepare to fall back to the heights of north castle but at the same
time to present a show of defense to the enemy

   i had come from my home in maryland some mouths previous on a visit
to some relatives in new york and was present during all those stirring
events which led to the occupation of the dity by the british i made haste
to ally myself with colonel smallwoods maryland regiment and was conse-
quently with the army at white plains

   on the afternoon of thursday the day after the battle while i was
sitting in my tent crouching under my wraps in the chilly air i was
awakened from my reverie by the vision of a figure darkening the entrance
i looked up and beheld an officer in -a rather seedy uniform

      captain heywood i believe    said he

    at your service i replied

    i have a letter for you from the general he said handing me a note
which was folded with the utmost precision and addressed in a clear bold
hand

     i believe it does not require me to take back your reply he continued
with a bow

      whom have i the honor of addressing   i inquired

   captain ephraim wilson of the westchester militia he answered
and with a parting salute he was gone

   hastily tearing open the missive i found that it was from general
washington and requested an immediate audience with me at headquarters
so i brushed down my well worn suit not having been able to procure a
uniform and made my way to the old miller mansion in the hallway i met
colonel robert h harrison the generals secretary and as we saluted he
said

     the general is in that corner room walk in  he is expecting you

i entered the commander in chief was staiiding with his hands behind
the generals emissary	

him gazing out of the window at my entrance he looked around how
can i describe his face  so serene so kind hearted so earnest and honest
and true  with him a friend was always a friend but an enemy while he
must be conquered was to be granted the certain rights and fair play to
which he was entitled i am always thankful for the recollection of that
face

   he met me half way and offered his hand with a warm hearty grasp

    hey wood i am glad to see you he said  but what has detained you
so long   

    i informed him that i had received his note but a few moments before

   i can see him now in my minds eye as he stood before me tall and
stately enveloped in thought if ever mortal was endowed with kingly
gifts that man was george washington

      i shall have to speak to colonel harrison about this   he said at
length  he sent you the note almost an hour ago

   we conversed for a few moments  matters regarding our respective
families for i had known the general some years

    then he went over to the hearth and stood poking the blazing logs with a
stick

    heywood said he  i wonder if i can ask you to do me a favor 

      i am entirely at your service sir   i replied

   and to serve your country at the same time he continued with a
gentle inflection of the voice

     i would all the more gladly assist you i answered

     good said he  the country is in a serious plight the crisis is at
hand and she needs all the assistance we can render if we cannot manage
to hold our own at north castle the end is near it is quite important that
i should forward a letter at once to major ellery at the mouth of croton
river i presume that i can trust you with its safe transmission to major
ellery    the anxious look that i had noticed on my entrance overspread
his features

    general washington i am a southerner i replied with emphasis

    true he retorted but i have known some southerners who are not
wholly trustworthy

   iam a man of honor sir i rejoined with some heat considerably
nettled that he should for a moment question my integrity he must have
noticed this

    forgive me captain he said  but i have so much to contend with
desertions are frequent and there seems to be such a lack of interest in our
common cause that at times i sometimes get a little out of patience

    but to come to the point he continued his face brightening some
of the people of dutchess county have offered us a supply of ammunition
and provisions of which we are seriously in need major ellery has been
ordered to convey them hither by wtay of tarrytown i am informed that
general howe is preparing another attack and have issued instructions that
the army make ready to fall back among the hills of north castle the
enemy will of course follow and take possession of our present camp you


the generals emissary

undoubtedly see the necessity of my getting word to major ellerv to proceed
to north castle furthermore i am told that the war vessels which have
been sent up the north river by the enemy are now anchored at tarrytown
in this case it would be judicious for major ellery to leave the post road
bordering the river at sparta and take the one leading southeast you
comprehend the situation do you not of course there is considerable per-
sonal risk to be incurred you are willing to go 

   i bowted in assent

    i am deeply gratified captain hey wood he shook my hand with a
hearty grasp  good by he added as he handed me the note  may
the good god guard jou

   when i opened the door i remember he called out to me   do not lose
that letter or you may lose your head i believe this was the nearest the
general ever came to a joke life with him was filled with too many serious
problems for levity

   i hurried back to my tent and equipped myself for my journey i secured
the letter in the inside pocket of my great coat and was soon in the saddle
riding at a brisk canter towards tarrytown

   i made my way through this village without molestation and had ridden
not more than half a mile when i discovered that i was being followed i
heard the clatter of hoofs in the distance and instinctively halted to listen
there was a curve in the road at that place where it followed the course of a
stream through a dense growth of trees i could tell by the rhythmic fall
of the hoofs that it was a single horseman and i pulled out my pistol and
waited  for a true marylander will never flee from danger if he proved to
be an enemy i was prepared for him

   the man came galloping around the turn in the road aud to my surprise
i was confronted by captain wilson

    oh   said he with a wave of his hand  i am indeed fortunate cap-
tain hey wood i am  a little errand for his majesty-general washington
of course you know i mean we will call him  his majesty  when the war
is over i had contemplated a lonesome ride but i see you are going in my
direction i hope you will allow me the pleasure of your company

   we had started again at an even gallop

   could it be possible i thought that general washington had mistrusted
me and had sent this man along either to watch me or to take a duplicate
note to major ellery 

   although my gentlemanly instincts forbade my inquiring into his business
i was secretly glad of his company for his pleasant conversation helped to
while away the time

   the clouds which had been threatening rain all day now began to dis-
charge their contents and when wg reached the little hamlet of sparta the
very heavens seemed to be coming down in cold torrents

   a little way further on we arrived at a tavern located at a fork iu the
road where wilson stopped and informed me that he was going to put up for
a time and after considerable demurring i too dismounted for i told
myself that major ellery would be obliged to pass this way should he
the generals emissary



attempt to brave such a storm and to this i adduced the fact that i was
chilled to the bone

   the door opened into a capacious hall at the opposite end of which was
an immense fireplace an elderly gentlemanly appearing man and a young
woman were sitting near the hearth the woman was evidently preparing
something to eat the both rose at our entrance and looked at us in a half
frightened half suspicious questioning way

   we bowed and on inquiry were informed that  old brady as the host
was called was somewhere about the premises and that his wife was lying
very ill in an adjoining room the old gentleman said that he and his
daughter had arrived some time ago and had found it necessary to stop 
account of the storm and were obliged to prepare their own refreshmeut
we were not of the southern party-meaning the british no he
thought not glancing at wilsons uniform well he and his daughter were
traveling from white plains to albany and expected to take a boat from
peekskill the next day his name was reuben everard and this was his
daughter ruth what were our names

   while this informal method of introduction had been progressing i was
busily eyeing the girl who was watching her father

   she appeared to be about nineteen or twenty years of age her rather
slender form gave her the appearance of being taller than she really was
her face was a trifle pale probably from the fatigue of the journey her
rich brown hair was arranged in a loose knot at the crown of the head and
hung in flowing curls to her shoulders her eyes were of a sort that are
rarely seen-a deep brown out from which seemed to shine an inherent
sweetness of soul these with a daintily curving mouth formed what
seemed to me one of the sweetest faces i had ever seen

   the old gentleman proved to be very genial and urged us to partake of the
luncheon which his daughter had prepared miss everard insisted on our
taking off our coats and drying them by the fire

   it is not necessary to record any of the conversation and incidents which
occurred during my call at the tavern but it is sufficient to say that i passed
an unusually pleasant hour and miss everards frank and genial manner
almost wholly absorbed my attention but i did not entirely forget myself
for i remember going to the door once or twice to view the state of the
weather and finally when there came a lull in the violence of the storm i
leisurely prepared to continue my journey

   i was loth to leave but i am a man of honor and knew my duty i
waved an adieu to the old gentleman and his daughter but miss everard was
fumbling nervously among her wraps and to my disappointment did not look
up

   wilson followed me to the door with many good wishes and gave me his
hand not being thoroughly familiar with the ground i was traveling i in-
quired of him which road led to the mouth of the croton he thought for a
moment and said  take the one to the right

   for all the rain had abated there was a severe gale blowing from the
northeast and the road was in places sheathed several inches deep with mud

the generals emissary

i took the direction suggested by captain wilson which led up a long hill
and on reaching the summit i was suddenly brought to a standstill by a
couple of rough looking fellows armed with muskets

      halt    they cried

   i reined up

    friend or foe  one of them demanded

     that depends on circumstances   i answered coolly

    come now young fellow no fooling there said the other speak
up or ill blow your brains out are you for the north or south 

   noticing that one of the men wore a blue cockade on his hat i answered
confidently  north and a messenger from general washington clear the
road  

    not so fast young man said the one wearing the cockade advancing
a few steps and taking hold of my bridle   what is j our business   

   if the man had been alone i could have given him his deserts for his in-
solence but the other one kept a close watch on me with his musket ready

    im looking for major ellery i replied

    major ellery

    yes at the mouth of the croton

   mouth of the croton he exclaimed why you wouldnt reach
the mouth of the croton by this road in a year  

   i looked at the fellow in surprise  which is the road man 

    the one to the left he replied

   i tried to turn my horse in the direction of the tavern but the man at the
bridle still held me fast

   hold on there he cried we cant let you go until you give us
some proofs of citizenship you said you were a messenger from mr
washington cant you show us some writings or something of the sort
just to make our conscience easy  

   it was evident that i was on the wrong track thanks to captain wilson
i realized that i must get back to the main road soon or i would be liable to
miss major ellery

    yes i said  i have iu my pocket a note for major charles ellery
written in the generals own hand i fished into my pocket where i had
placed the letter but to my utter astonishment discovered that it was gone

   the fellow standing b noticed my dismay but misinterpreted it

    lost it i suppose said he with a cynical laugh  thats what they
all say when they get caught bill i guess this is the one were after dis-
mount sir we shall have to see captain hunter about this

   while the fellow was talking it flashed through my mind how i had been
duped delay would now be fatal to my mission even my honor might be
questioned i knew that it would be useless to argue with these two stub-
born countrymen there was but one thing to do and although it was at-
tended with great risk i did it quickly as the man turned to say some-
thing to his companion i cracked him over the head with the butt of my
pistol which i had instinctively grasped when accosted it was a good sound
blowr and the man threw his hand to his head and reeled backward
the generals emissary



   as i turned my horse i heard the click of the others flintlock but
thauks to a protecting providence the rain had spoiled his priming

   as i rode down the hill the full effect of my loss grew upon me what
would general washington say when he heard of it  and if the fact became
generally known i would be made a laughing stock in the army i was con-
vinced now that captain wilson had played me false and had probably stolen
the letter from my coat at the tavern while my back was turned wilson
was undoubtedly a british spy and the wretch had put me in a pretty box

   by the time i burst into the door of the tavern i was in a high state of
excitement old mr everard was seated calmly by the fire and looked round
at my intrusion

      where is he   i cried out

    who  your friend do you mean 

    my friend   i shouted  my friend  he is a thief and a liar 
where is he  

   mr everard looked confused i dont know he replied i cannot
tell he left a moment ago my daughter sewed his coat for him and-

      where is your daughter   i interrupted

     she was here a moment ago- 

   i did not wait to hear the rest but rushed out into the air i saw a man
walking near the horseshed aud made for him but found that he was the
stable boy i learned from him that the man who had accompanied me had
ridden towards the south just a few seconds previous and that a few minutes
before the young lady miss everard had ordered her horse and had gone
north with  old brady the host

   here was a new phase of the case could it be possible that the young
lady was the thief no i argued what motive could she have for pur-
loining my letter  how could she ever know that i had such a letter  of
course these thoughts passed through my mind in much less time than it
takes to write them down and in a moment i was on my horse and dashing
down the post road in pursuit of captain wilson as i said before the mud
was deep and as the horse struck out heartily through it it often splashed as
high as my head and came down in a shower

   but i had no time to consider my own convenience in fact i was wholly
absorbed with the one purpose of capturing the villain who had treated me so
basely down a hill we went flying and at a turn in the road i caught sight
of a flying horseman ahead darkness was rapidly descending but i could
see that i was gaining for each second the figure in advance assumed a more
definite outline as we rushed along i remembered the black shadow of a
house at the right but this was passed in an instant i knew by his actions
that the rider was conscious that he was being pursued for i could see him
kick his spurs into his horses flanks to urge him on

   suddenly the man switched round a corner and into the lane which leads
through sparta to the river landing i spurred on with renewed effort fear-
ing to miss my prey but no as i turned the corner both horse and rider
were floundering about at the summit of a slight incline the animal was
evidently in a fit but the man was on his feet in an instant


the generals emissary

     hold there   i cried as i reined up and recognized captain wilson

    ha  is that you captain heywood   he yelled back   take that  

   his pistol flashed and the ball grazed my left ear but i think i could
have made at him had it gone through my heart

     you wretch   i cried snapping my pistol at him but it would not go
off i was on foot in an instant for a gentleman will never take an undue
advantage of his adversary and compelled him to defend himself with his
sword after a pass or two i found that he was  swordsman and before he
could fly i pierced him through the left shoulder pie uttered a piteous cry
and fell backward

     where is my paper you miserable thief   i glared at him

   oh  help im dying he pleaded

    where is my paper   i demanded

   oh  oh  im going to die have mercy on me help me over to
that house where i can be more comfortable and i will tell you

    my anger relaxed somewhat at the sight of this over polite young gentle-
man groveling in the soft mud possibly in the pangs of death i dragged
him to the house referred to and from which a man had appeared as our
brawl ended

   we soon had wilson lying on the floor and set to work stanching the
blood

    now sir my paper   i demanded my auger returning at the sight of
him tolerably comfortable

    i hate to give it up he said with a sullen gleam  i would have
made a good thing out of the information the captain of the phoenix- 

    come  come   i interrupted loudly  i have  time to waste you
poor despicable spying hypocrite out with it  

   my tone was threatening and he replied  in my inside pocket if i
could use my arm i would get it

   i fumbled in his pocket but found nothing except a blank letter sheet
folded

   you scoundrel   i cried  will you lie to my face when i have it in
my power to consign you to the place where you belong  you know that
letter is not there

     not there   he exclaimed half rising there was in his face a look
of genuine surprise  then i dont know where it is and he sank back as
if exhausted and closed his eyes

    i was truly in a quandary i searched his pockets and his boots but with
no success my head fairly reeled with the multitude of thoughts and sug-
gestions that crowded my brain

    could it be possible after all that i had been deceived by fair eyes and
that miss everard was the true thief in that case the man before me had
suddenly become a lunatic or possibly he and miss everard were confed-
erates but could the possessor of such clear brown ees be guilty of such
an act  the alternative now left me was to find either her or her father and
learn what they knew

    i ordered the owrner of the house to keep a close watch on wilson until i
the generals emissary



should return had he been equal to the task i should have compelled him
to ride back with me

   it was terribly dark and the dripping of wet from the somber trees by the
roadside gave an unusually ghostly effect to the surroundings i urged my
horse into a gallop and was soon at the inn again but as i was dismounting
i was surrounded by three men who secured my arms before i could defend
myself

      what is the meaning of all this   i demanded

    you are just the chicken we are after said one  were ahvays 
the lookout for just such as you southern spies are not going to thrive well
in this soil

    but i am of the northern party and am a messenger from the general
to major ellery

   exactly said the man but youll wish you hadnt seen the major
quite so soon 

   they hustled me into the main hall of the inn where i found seated at a
table looking over a map a large man of middle age possessing a round
jovial face	

   heres another one major announced one of my captors we just
caught him eavesdropping at the door

    are you major ellery  i inquired

    that is my name sir he replied

   well major ellery i went  i wish to protest against the very
discourteous and uncivil manner in which i have been treated by these men
i have come by order of general washington to instruct you to proceed to
north castle instead of white plains the whole army will be at north
castle in a day or so you are to leave the post road just below sparta in
order to avoid any trouble from the enemys ships at tarrytowu

    your name sir he asked

    captain walker hey wood of the maryland volunteers

   he motioned one of the men to him and whispered something to him
whereupon the fellow entered a room somewhere back of me and the major
contiuued his questioning

    the general invariablyconsigns his orders to writing you doubtless
have some communication from him for me i imagined that i saw his eyes
twinkle as he said this

   i bit my lip in embarrassment but did not reply i would willingly con-
fide my misfortune to the major but to do so before those country lunkheads
standing by me was more than i could endure

   captain hey wood said the major finally i perceive that there is
something wrong it is a very serious offense with which you are charged
the fate of a spy as you know is to hang i shall consider your case and
possibly refer it to the commander in chief in the meantime i shall be
obliged to have you confined in the guard room

   i was turned about and pushed through the door of the room already
mentioned which was immediately closed

   to my astonishment there sat old mr everard and ruth they arose as
io

the generals emissary

i entered and miss everard greeted me witli a pleasant smile

     i am glad to see that ou have returned safety she said

     yes i replied doggedly   rather too safely for my own satisfaction

     you had a letter from general washington did you not  she inquired

     yes i replied with surprise  but how did you kuow about it  

     because i stole it she replied laughing

     what  you stole my letter  

     from captain wilson your friend she added archly

    the whole situation was now as clear as day to me so i was not over-
come with surprise when she went on to tell how while i had my back
turned she had caught sight of wilson transferring the letter from my
pocket to his own  that while he was at the door bidding me good by she had
managed to make a rent in his coat which she offered to sew up for him
although he was in a great hurry he could not resist taking advantage of
her kindness and in the meantime she had secured the letter and had replaced
it with a blank letter sheet which she had found among her belongings
when captain wilson put on his coat and was ready to start he felt in his
pocket and was evidently satisfied with the knowledge that he had there a
valuable bit of information

    after a slight delay miss kverard explained the situation to brady and
together they started towards the mouth of the croton after me but met
major eller a short distance out he received the note and halted at the
tavern for a while to discover my whereabouts if possible

    miss everard said that she had her suspicions of captain wilson from the
first

    i began to think how stupid i had been not to make sure of my letter
before starting to think that a hardened soldier like myself should have
given more attention to miss everards brown eyes than the business iu hand 
what a consummate fool she must thiuk me  this was my reflection as i
stood in embarrassed silence

    but to my relief at this moment major ellery appeared and coming up
offered his hand

   captain hey wood he said his face radiant with good humor i
must ask your pardon for my recent conduct but i could not refrain from
having a little sport out of your discomfiture besides i kuew that it would
afford you an agreeable surprise to learn that this brave young lady saved
your reputation as a soldier

    as soon as i had recovered sufficiently from my surprise we rode to
sparta to secure wilson but he had disappeared aud the man of the house
was nowhere to be found we fired the place on the supposition that the
owner was a tory

   i gained major ellerys permission to accompany mr everard and his
daughter to peekskill on the next day aud i might add by the way that
i had by this time become so infatuated with the browrn eyes that i man-
aged to have a little private chatwith their owner which resulted in her
changing her last name to hey wood at the end of the war

the majors plot

a tale of intrigue and mystery involving the penrose family in a network of crime and bringing
more tlian one life into jeopardy-perilous experiences in the indian cavern and a nights
journey which ends in a terrible immurement-a boldly conceived conspiracy
which stops at no expedients and hazards all risks

synopsis of chapters previously published

    dick penrose lives with his grandfather on the squires extensive farm in lewisberry a
country town near harrisburg dicks mother is dead and his father went abroad some fifteen
years before and has not been heard of since till one day he comes back like one risen from
the dead in the shape of maior horace penrose who accounts for his prolonged absence and
silence by telling a fearful story of captivity among the moors

    the night of his return a fire breaks out in a store in the village and dick rescues an english-
man who had obtained lodging there for the night this fellow whose name is henry ford
strangely enough is recognized by the major as a valet whom he had brought from london with
him and from whom he became separated in new york he is taken to the farm where he and
his master have many secret interviews

    in course of time the squires health fails mysteriously and dr galen the family physician at
last thinks he discovers evidence of vegetable poisoning being used he suspects ford and one
night sets dick to watch what goes on in the sick room dick conceals himself in a large
clothes press and is horrified to see his father enter the room take a phial from his pocket and
pour some fluid into the squires medicine before handing it to him hoping that there has
been some mistake the boy determines to hurry off to dr galen at once for an explanation
but in his excitement he leaves the doors of the wardrobe open the major learns that he has
been watched and dick is captured and dosed with chloroform before he can get off the
grounds

    the major proposes sinking dick in the pond at once but ford takes him to a private in-
sane asylum near new york whence he makes his escape aided by dock dawson a tram pish
character who has turned up in harrisburg and who knows more about the major than the latter
cares to have spread abroad

    meantime the squire grows worse and the major urges that his new will be made at once
the family lawyer is summoned and the signature is about to be affixed in the presence of wit-
nesses when a commotion is heard in the corridor and the next instant the door opens to admit
dick followed by dock dawson henry ford and a stranger with tanned skin and fair mustache

chapter xxxvii-in which a strange story is related

 a s major penrose saw the strange procession filing into the room his face
      assumed an ashen pallor

    sacre   he muttered between his clinched teeth and then moving back
from the bed he stood still with folded arms

   mr grimwood looked on in stupefied amazement and the doctor rushed
forward to embrace dick but before he could accomplish this the stranger
in the rear of the party moved quietly forward revealing as the light shone
full upon him features that bore a startling resemblance to major horace
penrose

this story began in the november  issue of the argosy the five back numbers will
be mailed to any address on receipt of  cents


the maiors plot

   bless my heart  exclaimed mr grimwood  and dr galen as the
truth flashed across his mind dropped feebly into a chair

   the stranger walked straight to the squires bedside and clasping the
sick mans pale wan hands iu his own he dropped his head on the bedclothes
and burst into tears

    bress de lawd massa horace has come home dis time sobbed pompey
from the hall and then all was silence for the space of a moment or two

    the squire still erect among the pillows looked wonderingly at those in
the room hardly understanding what had taken place

     ah there is dick   he muttered as his eyes fell on the lad  dick
is a good boy  he has come home again tear up that will grimwood i
have changed my mind there is plenty for both dont cry horace dont
cry you ought to be glad dick has come back  you ought to beglad-

   then he closed his eyes and sinking low on the pillow went calmly to
sleep entirely ignorant of what had just occurred

    the stranger rose to his feet and dashed the tears from his eyes

    i am the real horace penrose he said calmly  i thank god that i
have come in time to frustrate the most fiendish crime ever attempted by
mortal man there stands the scoundrel you have known as major horace
penrose i denounce him as eugene maillard the branded criminal from
toulon the perpetrator of the great bannister robbery for whom the police
have vainly searched for years and i accuse him of attempting to poison my
father and of trying to kill my son dick first by bullet then by drowning
he has committed other terrible crimes as these men can and will prove to
your satisfaction and horace penrose turned to dawson and ford wtho
were standing directly behind him the one savagely triumphant the other
pale with fright

   it was a terribly dramatic scene and all eyes were fixed on the false
major penrose the self convicted criminal for the convulsive workings of
his face the trembling lips the wildly rolling eyes expressed the despair
the agony and the deadly passion that were raging in his heart twice he
attempted to speak but his lips refused to frame the words

   then with a fearfully quick movement he drew a revolver from his
pocket and turned the muzzle on ford

     you traitor   he hissed as he pulled the trigger

    the report was followed by a loud cry and as the smoke cleared ford fell
back on the floor

    before any one had time to act the assassin sprang headlong through the
window carrying sash and all with him pie cleared the porch roof at a
bound and swung nimbi into the yard

   one thousand dollars to the man who stops him shouted horace
penrose as he bounded through the window in pursuit and ran to the edge of
the roof trampling the broken fragments of glass under foot

   miller and jackson were in the vicinity but the assassins weapon
speedily scared them away  and when horace penrose reached the ground
the desperate villian was spurring at full speed across the fields mounted on
the best horse in the stables
the majors plot

i

   the news spread through lewisberry and the neighboring country like
wildfire men on horseback and in buggies pursued the assassin clear
into harrisburg and full information was telegraphed to the police from the
nearest point  the railroad eugene maillard-for by this name we must
in future know him-was traced to the bridge and here the trail ended

   horace penrose had gone straight to harrisburg himself  but in the
evening he returned to the farm more than half convinced that his prey had
made good his escape

   here he found joyful news awaiting him a decided change for the
better had taken place in the squires condition-produced no doubt by
dicks return-and he now had every prospect of recovery ford was lying
in an upper room with a bullet in his lungs but dr galen declared that he
would probably recover

    it was necessary of course that the squire should be kept very quiet for
some time to come

    he must be kept in ignorance of what has occurred said the doctor
the strange story can be broken to him very gently when his strength
begins to increase

   the lower part of the house was thrown open that evening aud betsy
prepared such a feast as she had never equaled before in her life

   after supper the lamps were lit iu the cozy library and an expectant
group gathered about the big table-dr galeu mr grimwood dick jack
douglas walter and nellie maynard aud mr dock dawson who looked
strangely out of place in such an assemblage horace penrose sat at the
head of the table  and all awaited with breathless interest the story he had
to relate

    it is fifteen years or more since i left this home he began  and little
did i dream then of the long time that was destined to elapse before i would
see it again i wandered over the continent and finally located in paris
here i soon formed a circle of friends and among them was the man who fled
from the house today-a young frenchman who called himself eugene
maillard he was clever witty agreeable  in fact a charming companion 
though what principally cemented our friendship was the perfect resemblance
we bore to each other-a resemblance which as you have seen for yourselves
today is still as strong as ever he was a brave man-i must say that much
for him-and through his persuasion i was induced to enlist in the french
army

     i have not time to relate my story in detail tonight i must deal only
with the leading facts let it suffice to say that our regiment was ordered to
algiers where we saw much service among the arabs then came the war
with china aud we were ordered off to tonquiu in that severe campaign i
won my promotion and returned to algiers a major

    i was fated to enjoy my honors but a short time a few months later
maillard and myself were captured while conducting an attack on a hostile
tribe of moors and for the last six years we have suffered untold horrors from
our cruel captors maillard aud i were not separated a fact for which i was
extremely grateful at the time we were slaves of the sameshiek worked


the majors plot

together ate together and slept in the same prison cell at night i had
managed to retain a bunch of home letters and a diary these i read over to
maillard in our spare moments and soon he was as thoroughly intimate with
my past life as i was myself even then he must have been hatching the
plot which he put into execution later on

    last july we were sold to a moorish shiek who lived many miles nearer
the coast and the treatment we received from our new master afforded a
reasonable hope of escape we planned our arrangements very cleverly and
one dark night we overpowered the guard and fled across the desert my
companion was stronger and in better condition than i morning found
him comparatively fresh while i was completely worn out and exhausted

    it was necessary to go on for our enemies were no doubt close behind
at sunrise we found a pool of muddy water in the desert aud while i was
stretched on the sand drinking in fresh strength and courage with every
mouthful of the fluid my companion knocked me senseless with a heavy club
that he carried i recovered my consciousness an hour later to find myself
in the hands of the moors maillard was miles away and my diaries and
letters were missing

     i was dragged back to captivity  but just a mouth later i made a second
attempt to escape and this time reached the coast in safety at the harbor of
metilla i could learn nothing here of maillard and i concluded that he had
either perished in the desert or been captured by some wandering natives

      a sailing vessel took me to algiers where i was greeted as one risen
from the dead and a few days later took passage to marseilles intent on
reaching home as -speedily as possible my first intimation of what had
occurred here during my absence came from mr dawson whom i encoun-
tered in a very remarkable manner and also from the wounded man upstairs
who recognized me by the resemblance i bore to his confederate and made an
all but successful attempt to end my life the story i have just related is
but a link i believe in a long and complicated chain we have still to hear
dick mr dawson and henry ford their narrative will complete the
chain  

chapter xxxviii-in which the chain of evidence is

completed

   exclamations of wonder and amazement greeted the close of the re-
markable story contained in the previous chapter

    now dawson said the major  as you were acquainted with eugene
maillard even before i knew him suppose you tell us what you know about
him

    dawson flushed slightly and hitched his chair closer to the table

    yes he began hesitatingly  i knew him sixteen years ago in new
york city he had just escaped from a french prison an come to america
he was pretty young in those days but he was an old hand in crime he
planned the bannister robbery an carried it out too though henry ford
helped and i had a hand in the matter myself
the majors plot



   here dawson reddened and became visibly embarrassed while lawyer
grimwood gazed severely at him over his spectacles

   go on said the major kindly you expiated that offense and have
since reformed i can testify to that  

   dawson glanced gratefully at the major

   yes he resumed i put in my time at sing sing and all because
maillard turned traitor and played me into the hands of the police he and
ford went to europe while i was breaking stone that must be the time
you met maillard in paris it was a daring thing for him to go back there
when he knew the french police were looking for him ford went to london
and stayed there for two or three years if i aint mistaken then i got out
of prison at last and just by accident ran across ford one morning in the
police station at harrisburg he denied his identity at first but i was too
sharp to be fooled in that way and i traced him over into cumberland
county convinced that something big was in the wind

   at this point dawson reddened again probably at the recollection of his
encounter with the farmers wife

   then he proceeded to relate in a lengthy manner the balance of his story
with which the reader is familiar-his brief stay at the lisburn inn the assault
committed on him by maillard and ford his terrible adventures in the cavern
at rich hill his final escape into the open air-of which he retainedbut an
imperfect recollection-and the midnight escape from the farmhouse

   this part of the story was almost incredible to his hearers they found
it difficult to believe the late major penrose capable of such terrible crimes

   then dawson told how he had gone straight to harrisburg and worked to
save money of his chance meeting with dick and ford at the railway station
and how he followed them clear to rockport on the hudson when dawson
ended his hearers were still more amazed than ever

   it remained for dick however to cause the greatest sensation he began
his story with an account of the interview between himself and dr galen-
and at this point the doctor interrupted him to state briefly what had first
given rise to his suspicions

    then dick told in a thrilling manner of the terrible scene that he had wit-
nessed from his hiding place in the wardrobe and of the assault under the
locust trees here his remembrance ended and he took up the thread of the
story again at the asylum relating everything that had happened to him there
until his timely rescue by dawson

   then dawson told of the flight to new york and amused his hearers by
an account of the fight on the elevated railroad their mirth speedily
changed to horror however when he narrated the struggle in mulberry bend

   thus threads of the story were drawm together one by one and dick was
triumphantly vindicated his voice trembled when he thanked walter aud
jack for their steadfast faith in his honor and honesty-not forgetting a share 
of gratitude to miss nellie whose belief in his innocence had been fully as
firm as that of the boys

    the evidence was terribly strong though he admitted frankly  aud
i dont in the least blame those who thought me guilty
the majors plot

   a few links were still needed to complete the chain-somewhat unim-
portant ones it is true but their absence at this time was very vexatious

    oh  by the way exclaimed dr galen suddenly  how are we to ac-
count for that mark on this man maillards arm 

   he must have put it there himself said major penrose either with
india ink or with chemicals he knew that i possessed a mark of that kind
and feared that it would be called into question as a proof of identification
he was too cunningeven to overlook such a slight matter as that one thing
i wish to say right here dr galen and i know that all present will agree
with me my father owes his life to you your prompt action is all that
saved the cowardly assassin from completing his work

   the major would have said more but at that moment the doctors embar-
rassment was relieved by pompey who came cautiously into the room and
approached major penroses chair

    de man what was shot am askin fur you an fur de doctor lie said in
an audible whisper  hes bad mighty bad

    i must beg to be excused for a few moments said the major rising to
his feet and he hastily left the room followed by the doctor

   there was plenty to talk about during their absence and an hour slipped
by unnoticed then major penrose and dr galen returned

    how is ford  asked dick  will he recover 

   i think he will replied the doctor if no change sets in for the
worse the squire too is doiiig splendidly and i  longer have any fears
in his case the crisis is past

   the major showed plainly that he had something important to say as he
took his seat at the head of the table

    when we went up stairs an hour ago he began  we found ford in a
very restless condition his wound was giving him much pain and he feared
that he was going to die he declared that he wanted to make a full con-
fession and as he seemed to be greatly worried dr galen decided that it
would be best to prop him up on pillows and in short broken sentences he
told his story nothing was omitted i believe and i find that his narrative
supplies the missing links in the history of this awful and stupendous plot
the confession was a great relief to ford and he is now resting with a very
fair prospect of recovery but i see that ou are all anxious to hear what he
had to say so i will commence at once though i will tell you iu advance that
the story is not a long one

    you will be surprised to learn that fords participation in this crime was
to some extent accidental he confirms dawsons statement concerning
eugene maillard he went abroad with maillard after the bannister robbery
and leaving his companion at liverpool went on to london where he
remained nearly five years then he returned to new york living on his
wits for some time until by mere accident he encountered maillard who had
just returned from algeria the scoundrels plan was all matured at that
time as is shown by the fact that he registered under the name of horace
penrose	

    ford did not at once reveal himself to his old companion in crime he
the majors plot



followed him to harrisburg foolishly make known his identity one dark night
 the iron bridge over the susquehanna and was at once thrown over iuto
the water he saved himself by swimming and made his way to lewisberry
you all know how dick so bravely rescued him from the burning building
and i may add here that this noble deed saved dicks life on more than one
occasion

    by this time maillard recognized the need of a confederate he made
proposals to ford threatening in case he did not accept to hang him for
some terrible crime committed years ago in new york what this was
ford refuses to tell it was committed before he knew either maillard or
dawson and maillard only discovered it by accident ford was compelled to
agree and maillard made known the whole plot which to state it briefly
was as follows 

    dick and my father were both to be put out of the way and then
maillard and ford were to convert as much of the property as possible into
cash and flee to europe where they hoped to live in luxury and plenty for
the remainder of their lives this tremendous crime seems incredible on the
face of it but you have all seen how very nearly they succeeded to go
into details now would require more time than i can spare it was ford who
committed the first robbery when the squires will was stolen and it was
maillard who shot dick in the head how determined he was to get dick
out of the road is shown by the upsetting of the boat  the yellow breeches
creek when dick and miss maynard made such a wonderful escape

     ford declares that this was done  purpose and i dont doubt it he
says moreover that maillard had a confederate in some banking house who
informed him of the contents of the second will-which was drawn up in
your office mr grimwood-and also gave him statements of the squires
account from time to time this is a matter that must be speedily looked
into ford declares that this party is not known to him

   then dawson here appeared  the scene threatening to upset the
whole plot and was speedily put out of the way-forever as they fondly
hoped the remainder of the story is too revolting to tell maillard
actually began to poison my father and was discovered at his deadly work by
dick the rest you know-how dick was attacked while running to inform
dr galen of his discovery drugged with chloroform and taken to a private
asylum up the hudson it was maillard who broke open the secretary that
night and stole the money pie had intended to kill dick and throw the
body into the millpond but ford held out against this and proposed the
other plan by which dick was removed from the scene and in a manner
which allowed  suspicions to fall upon the perpetrators of the deed

    i have one more thing to say the keeper of this asylum dr clinch
is himself connected indirectly with the bannister robbery which explains
how he was induced to receive dick ostensibly as a patient but really as a
prisoner he shall pay dearly for his share in the crime i shudder to think
how nearly this awful villainy succeeded i made a mistake in not bringing
officers of the law with me from harrisburg had i done so eugene
maillard would probably be now in custody as it is i fear greatly that he
the majors plot

has escaped and that alone mars the gladness i feel at being restored to my
family after fifteen years of exile

   the major paused and at that moment a heavy rap was heard on the front
door

chapter xxxix-a midnight clew

   major penrose went to the door and as he opened it the lamp that
was burning dimly in the hall revealed a strange man standing on the porch

    are you major penrose  he asked  and when the major nodded assent
the other handed him a yellow envelope saying heres a telegram sir
that was sent to shiremanstown with instructions to have it taken right over
here at any cost the operator sent me with it and i came to lewisberry on
horseback thinking you lived in the town the postmaster told me where
to find you

    the major hastily tore open the envelope and read the contents

     it is well you came over with this he said turning to the messenger 
  here is a reward for your trouble   he slipped a bank note into the grati-
fied mans hand and hastily closing the door returned to the library

    the sight of the telegram caused a flutter of expectation

i must go to harrisburg at once said the major something has

evidently turned up this is the message i have received 

to major horace penrose

                         	lewisberry pa

    come over at once

burns chief of police

   i will accompany you said mr grimwood i am anxious to see
this thing through

   and i and i exclaimed every one present not excepting miss
nellie who rose to her feet in great excitement however it was very plain
that all could not go dr galen of course could not be spared from the
house

   the major had immediately ordered the old family carriage and two horses
to be brought to the door and by the time it arrived it was definitely decided
that the party should consist of major penrose mr grimwood dock daw-
son and dick

    they drove hurriedly off through the rain and the darkness

   old pompey who was mounted on the box proved to be a skilful driver
and at two oclock in the morning they rattled over the iron bridge and
trotted rapidly down market street they turned into third street and
drew up before the station house

   chief burns was expecting them and the whole party were hurried into
the private office where two persons were already seated a portly gray
haired man with gold rimmed glasses and a youth of perhaps twenty with a
pale frightened face

   chief burns introduced the man as mr medcroft the banker

   this is mr barret he added turning to the young man who if i
am not mistaken has brought us some very important information tonight
the majors plot

   he lias a very disgraceful story to tell major penrose said mr
medcroft  but i think you will agree with me that he deserves some sym-
pathy and some credit for making such a full confession

   seeing that the interview had assumed a painful and embarrassing nature
mr grimwood dock dawson and dick considerately went into another
room

   then with many tears and in a husky broken voice frank barret
repeated in the presence of the major the confession that he had roused mr
medcroft out of bed to make some few hours before it is not necessary to
repeat this in detail for the reader is already acquainted with the sad story of
frank barrets crime

    briefly the lad told of his dealings with the false major penrose omitting
nothing whatever

   at nine oclock tonight he added in conclusion i was coming
down front street on my way to gampers saloon to play a game of pool
and as i reached the dark alley that leads down into market square be-
tween walnut and market streets i saw a man creep over from the park
and dodge into the alley his collar was up about his throat but i recog-
nized him at a glance it was the man i have always known as major
penrose i concluded to follow him-dont know why-and i kept close
to him all the way to the square a herdic coach was standing in front
of the bolton house and before i could get near he had dodged into this
and was driving up second street in front of the telegraph office a big
crowd was collected they were reading the last edition of the paper that
was pasted on the inside of the window i pushed forward and saw the
startling account of the dewisberry crime

    at first i didnt know what to do then i made up my mind to do the
only thing that seemed possible i went straight to mr medcrofts house
and made a clean breast of it all he brought me right down here and i told
my story to mr burns i have gone terribly wrong i know-all on account
of fast living i went into bad company  i learned to drink and gamble  to
frequent the theaters  i joined several clubs and i had to dress well-these
things took more money than i could earn and i went dowtn before the first
temptation that came in my way

    do what you please with me only-only think a little of my mother of
my sister what will they think when they know all-oh how can i endure
the misery and the disgrace- 

   here the wretched boy broke down completely and his convulsive sobs
melted the hearts of every one present

    the path of the transgressor is hard murmured mr medcroft softly
and then no one spoke for a moment

    time presses gentlemen said chief burns in a hard dry voice  i
must tell you what has been accomplished and then we can decide on our
course of action immediately on receipt of this information i sent out and
questioned all the drivers of the herdic coaches the right man was soon
found he had taken up a passenger in front of the bolton house and let
him off in the neighborhood of third and cumberland streets this was
io

the majors plot

no doubt eugene maillard i feel confident tliat he is now sleeping soundly
at no  cumberland street where he held his interviews with frank
barret he has probably rented this room under an assumed name and hopes
to remain in hiding there until he can leave the city in safety

    he is a desperate character said major penrose  i should advise
you to lose no time in arresting him

   i agree with you responded the chief we will start at once
your party of course will wish to see the thing through i will procure a
couple of cabs and take a squad of officers with me mr medcroft can go
along if he wishes and your carriage major can follow in the rear

   in the confusion that ensued major penrose whispered a few words of
hope in frank barrets ear

    come round to the bank as usual in the morning frank said mr
medcroft i want to see you you had better go straight home now
your mother may be alarmed at jour absence

   and dont you intend to arrest me gasped frank in bewilderment
 god bless you mr medcroft and you too major penrose

   he walked unsteadily from the room and was gone

chapter xl-in which the villain is tracked

   ten minutes later two cabs and a carriage rattled up third street through
the deserted city it was still raining and the wet asphalt threw grotesque
shadows ahead of them as they passed under the electric globes the
illuminated clock on the capitol pointed to four as they crossed state street
and ten minutes later they rolled into cumberland street and drew up at the
curb a few doors from the grim three story brick house that was numbered


   the electric light shone dimlj on the tin sign  rooms to let chief
burns sent four officers to invest the rear of the house by way of the back
yard and when a sufficient time had elapsed for them to reach their post he
pulled the front door bell a moment later the third story window was
raised

    whats wanted   inquired a voice from above

    come down quietly replied the chief  important business

   five minutes passed and then mrs lee opened the door with a lighted
candle in her hand

    sorry to trouble you madamesaid the chief politely  but you have a
lodger whom i wish to see he came here about ten oclock last night

      then it must be mr andrew drummond   said the landlady   the man
who travels for a book firm this is the first night he lias been here
since-why law bless me there he is now i thought he was sound asleep
in bed  she pointed a trembling finger at major penrose who wras standing
behind the chief

   you are mistaken madame said the chief with a smile  but mr
drummond is undoubtedlj the man i wish to see show us to his room at
once
the majors plot



   his authoritative manner and the brass buttons on his coat frightened
mrs lee into silence she led the way upstairs followed by chief burns
major penrose and three officers

   there she said pausing before a door  this is mr drummonds
room

   chief burns quietly turned the handle but the door would not open

    locked on the inside he muttered  where do the windows of this
room open madame 

    on a shed replied mrs lee in a shaky voice  and that slopes close
to the ground then comes the yard and behind that the alley

    exactly said the chief  i see the situation no doubt my men are
in the yard by this time so here goes

   he tapped sharply on the panel of the door and as no answer came re-
peated the summons three or four times

   he cant be asleep said major penrose he is such a desperate
scoundrel that i half fear he will get away from us yet

    then the door must be broken into rejoined the chief  now
madame he added turning to mrs lee this is no place for you go
down stairs and remain there whatever damage we may do to your house
shall be paid for

   the landlady was only too glad to avail herself of this permission she
placed the candle on the floor and quickly disappeared

   chief burns placed his ear to the keyhole of the door and listened
intently for a moment or two

    by jove i hear a noise of some sort he whispered  both together
now major here goes one two with three  both men dashed
themselves heavily against the door and it gave way lock hinges and all
falling with a crash inside

   weapons were drawn instantly as one of the officers held aloft the candle
but it shone only on an empty room there stood the bed rumpled and dis-
heveled but its occupant had flown

   the window shouted chief burns look it is open the
scoundrel must have dropped right into the hands of my men no doubt
they have the nippers on him by this time  

   a loud shout coming that instant from the direction of the yard seemed
to confirm the chiefs words he ran to the window and dropped lightly
down  the shec followed by major penrose and the officers just as the
last man gained the sloping roof two or three revolvers cracked sharply from
the yard and some one called out there he goes burns dont let him
get away 

   major penrose turned and glanced up at the rear wall of the house
dawn was just breaking and in the dim light a figure was visible crawling
painfully up the water spout it was eugene maillard  and even as the
chief aud major penrose watched him the daring villain gained the edge of
the flat roof pulled himself on top and disappeared apparently untouched by
the bullets that had pattered around him

   the major was beside himself with rage and disappointment

     k
the majors plot

   a thousand dollars to the man who captures him he shouted loudly

   this liberal offer created great excitement among the officers and a rush
was made to procure ladders chief burns possessed a cool demeanor a
brief scrutiny of the roof which the fugitive had gained gave him the ker
to the situation on the right was a four story building that towered some
feet above the boarding house the dwelling on the left was only two
stories high with a sloping roof and several gable windows in the attic

   well get our man yet major he shouted encouragingly dont
lose a moment though follow me closely

   he swung from the shed and dropped lightly into the yard the police
had broken open the door of the house and rushing through the chief and
major penrose were speedily in the street the rest of the party were stand-
ing in front of the house and from all directions an excited crowd were
gathering all the windows in the neighborhood were open and people were
looking out many of them in their night clothes down the street came
four policemen on a run bearing a long ladder on their shoulders

   the chief thundered against the door next to the boarding house and it
was opened instantly by an old man who was struck speechless with amaze-
ment when the chief dashed past him and ran up the stairway followed by
the major and half a dozen officers they soon reached the attic aud the
chief tore both sashes from one of the front windows his appearance was
greeted by a hoarse cry- from the crowd in the street

   with drawn revolver he crept out on the narrow ledge that ran along the
front of the house and in a moment major penrose stood beside him they
turned the angles of the window-the chief going to the right major penrose
to the left-and crawled up the shingles toward the crest of the roof

   the flat top of the boarding house was now in view but nothing could be
seen of the fugitive

    go carefully whispered chief burns  he must be very close at
hand

    im ready for him replied the major as he cocked his revolver

chapter xul-in which the curtain falls

   hardly had the words recorded at the close of the preceding chapter left
the majors lips than a head rose over the crest of the house aud was followed
by a sharp report and a red flash

   im shot cried burns and with a vain attempt to keep his balance he
slipped down over the shingles

   three officers had already crawled out of the window and as the wounded
man came near they caught him tenderly and passed him through to their
companions inside

   major penrose blazed awray instantly but too late the assassin dodged
out of sight

   a hundred throats were yelling hoarsely in the street belc w as the major
advanced a few more steps up the roof he hardly realized the extreme
peril of the situation
the majors plot

    the fiend shall not escape me he muttered and then he turned to the
officers who were creeping behind him

    shoot at first sight he whispered  the assassin can never be taken
alive

   bang  a red flash blazed on the crest of the roof and the weapon shot
from the majors hand went spinning into the street far below

    this is the last act said a voice hoarse with passion and looking up
major penrose saw eugene maillard standing on the very pinnacle of the
roof not three yards distant

    this is the last act he repeated  we will go off the stage together
major but you will go first

   pie turned the muzzle of his revolver into the majors very eyes his
finger was on the trigger but with fiendish hatred he hesitated to end his
victims torture

   he had forgotten the presence of the officers below him-perhaps he did
not know they were there-and as he toyed with the trigger of his revolver
two shots rang out from the lower slope of the roof and with a shrill cry
eugene maillard dropped forward rolling past the very feet of his intended
victim past the officers who held the smoking weapons in their hands and
then plunged over the edge of the roof into the street below his fall was
drowned in the cries of the people

                                                                                                                           vl

   	t

    this is the last act eugene maillard had said and he spoke the truth

   when dawn struggled through the chill november mists that wrapped the
city in a shroud his bruised and lifeless body was borne through the streets
on a stretcher all that day the city was in a ferment of excitement and
crowds clustered about the modest brick house at no  cumberland
street aud surrounded the city hospital where the wounded chief of police
had been taken

   major penrose and party went directly back to eewisberry and before
nightfall the quiet country village wore an aspect that vividly reminded the
middle aged citizens of   war times  

   it is only proper that the curtain should fall with the death of the chief
villain and yet as an audience can claim the right to bring their favorite
actors out for a final bow before the lights are extinguished the reader is
surely entitled to the same privilege

   squire penrose recovered aud great was his amazement to learn the strange
events that had taken place at the farmhouse during his sickness

   it is needless to say that horace penrose proved to be a model son he
and dick will be worthy inheritors of the squires possessions and the good
old man-who locks to be safe for twenty years yet himself-has no fears for
the future

   chief burns pulled through after a hard fight for life and all who had
taken part in the cumberland street affair were amply rewarded

   it was the majors intention to deliver ford over to justice but that er-
ratic individual escaped from the farmhouse one night while convalescent
and all attempts to recapture him proved fruitless he is probably safe in


the majors plot

england by tliis time and it is to be hoped his future life will be free from
crime

   dock dawsons reward came in the shape of a permanent position on the
farm he receives a good salary and is a trusted member of the household
there is no cause to fear that he will ever betray the confidence placed in
him

   dr galen will always be the nearest and dearest friend of the family he
is more popular than ever he was not only in lewisberry but throughout the
neighboring country for miles and his practice has assumed such overwhelm-
ing proportions that he finds it absolutely impossible to treat half of his
patients

   pompey and betsy seem to have taken a new lease  life since the return
of major penrose and from all indications they will administer the affairs of
the household for many years to come

   it is a gratification to be able to state that frank barret is still employed
in the banking house of medcroft  holmes his friends know nothing of
the black page in his life

   his reinstatement was larely due to the influence of major penrose
though mr medcroft was not averse to giving the lad a new trial this con-
fidence has not been misplaced for frank is now as steady and industrious as
he once was wild and dissipated he has learned a lesson that will stick to
him through the future temptations of life

   dr clinch was dealt with in a very summary manner the new york
authorities were informed of his complicity in the celebrated bannister case
and he was promptly arrested dawson was the principal witness and
through his testimony the doctor was convicted and sent to sing sing for a
term of years

   the asylum at rockport on the hudson was thoroughly ventilated by the
newspapers and a radical change was made in its managment and method of
doing business most of the inmates however were genuinely insane and
among these was dicks friend major andre

   but three unfortunates were found who plainly had no business in such a
place and the exposure of the guilty parties who had put them there was a
nine days wonder

   the antiquarian club continues to flourish the bojs made several
attempts to force their way into the cavern at rich hill they had to
abandon the plan however for the whole well had caved in and tons of earth
and stone hid the entrance to the underground chamber where dick nellie
dock dawson and john manners so nearly lost their lives

   miss nellie maynard by the way is just as pretty and charming as ever
she and dick remain the best of friends and though dick is now away at
college they keep up the acquaintance just the same as mr jefferson the
postmaster could no doubt testify if he chose

   time alone can tell what results may develop from miss nellies connection

    while away at boarding school jolin jeffreys during a game of football accidental in-
jures a boy so badly that his life is despaired of jeffreys thereupon runs away from bolsover
and returns to his guardian in york who turns him adrift with only a sovereign after informing
him that the money left for him by his father has been lost through an unfortunate speculation
after tramping the streets for some time and receiving several rebuffs jeffreys finally finds a
position as under teacher at galloway house a school for little boys conducted by mrs trimble
the boys take to him which is sufficient to arouse the ire of mrs trimbles surly first assistant
her son jonah who tracks jeffreys on one of his evening rambles and afterwards abstracts from
his pocket a letter speaking of young forrester the boy injured at school jeffreys is once more
cast on the cold charities of the world which throws him only one sop in the shape of julius his
guardians dog who has been abandoned when mr halgrove moves away leaving not a trace
behind jeffreys tramps his way to grangerham where he can find out but little about for-

percy rimbolt the fourteen year old son of a wealthy family in the neighborhood with the
assistance of the dog julius he frustrates this and restores percy to his home

    mr rimbolt takes a fancy to jeffreys and appoints him to the post of private librarian at a
salary of a hundred pounds a year he gets on famously with percy and is treated with
marked favor by raby atherton percys cousin who is staying at wildtree during her fathers
absence in afghanistan with his regiment but mrs rimbolt dislikes the newcomer and neg-
lects no opportunity to humiliate him during the holidays mrs scarfe and her son arrive on
a visit and in the young man jeffreys recognizes a schoolmate at bolsover one fully cognizant
of the forrester affair they merely exchange civilities however and in one way or another
grate harshly on each other throughout the term of scarfes stay scarfe tries to prejudice raby
against jeffreys but sie refuses to listen to tales of the librarian behind his back some time
later after the household has moved to london scarfe writes to mrs rimbolt telling in ex-
aggerated fashion w iy jeffreys left bolsover mr rimbolt who has been made acquainted
with the whole history and elected to take jeffreys for what he is and not for what he was is

poor shelter finds jonah dead and a note from the angel  he has talked of as visiting him
saying that he passed away peacefully and the writing is that of raby atherton

chapter xxxv-three advertisements

the familiar writing caused jeffreys to stare in a dazed fashion for a
moment then quitting the garret hurriedly he entered the room of a
family of five who lived below him

    mrs pratt said he to the ragged woman who sat nursing her baby in
the corner   did you see who trimble had with him when he died   

   hes dead then sir-these fellow lodgers of jeffreys called him
sir in spite of his misery i knew that cough couldnt last my

annies begun with it shell go too its been hard enough too keep the
children but it will be harder to lose them   she cried

    jeffreys went to the bed where the little consumptive girl lay in a restless
sleep breathing heavily

     poor little annie   said he  i did not know she was so ill

    how could you  yes i saw the lady come down-a pretty wee thing
she comes and goes here majbe when she hears of annie shell come to
her

      do you know her name   

    no shes a lady they say i heard her singing upstairs to trimble 
it was a treat  youll be glad of some help i expect if youll mind the
children mr john ill go up and do the best we can for the poor fellow

    and so jeffreys with the baby in his arms sat beside the little invalid in
that lonely room while the mother putting aside her own sorrows went up
and did a womans service where it was most needed

    the next day he had the garret to himself

   that letter-how he treasured it -changed life for him he had ex-
pected when jonahs illness ended to drift back once more into the bitterness
of despair but that was impossible now

   he made no attempt to see the angel of whose visits to the alley he now
and again heard indeed whether he was in work or not he left early and
came back late on purpose to avoid a meeting he had long been known by
his neighbors only as john so that there was no chance of her discovering
who he was

   he worked patiently at the temporary manual labor on which he was
employed and when that came to an end he looked about resolutely for more

   meanwhile-do not smile reader-he made an investment of capital  in
other words he spent threepence in pen ink paper and a candle and spent
one night in his lonely garret writing it was a letter addressed to a
stranger on a public question in other words it was an article to a london
paper on life in a slum by one who lives there it was a quiet
uusensational paper with some practical suggestions for the improvement of
poor peoples dwellings and a few stories of experiences in which the
writer himself had taken a part

    he dropped it doubtfully into the editors box aud tried to forget about
it he dared not look at the paper next day and when two days passed
and he heard nothing he concluded that the bolt had missed fire

   but it was not so a week later the postman entered storr alley-an
unheard of event-and left him a letter it contained a money order for ten
shillings and read 

      the editor incloses ten shillings for the letter on slum life contributed
by mr john to the paper of the d he can take two mere  the same
subject at the same terms and suggests that mr john should deal especially
with- and here the editor gave an outline of the topics on which the
public would be most likely to desire information

   with overflowing heart and giving raby the credit he sat down and
wrote the two articles
living it down

   his first half sovereign went in a deed of mercy little annie lay dead
in her bed the night it arrived jeffreys that morning before he started to
work had watched the little spark of life flicker for the last time and go out
the mother worn out by her constant vigils lay ill beside her dead child
the father a drunkard out of work deserted the place and the two other
children the baby and the sister scarcely more than baby wailed all day for
cold and hunger what could he do but devote the first fruits of his pen to
these companions in distress the half sovereign sufficed for the childs
funeral with a little over for the sick mother and for the rest he took the
baby to his own garret for a night or two and tended it there as best he
could

   the two fresh letters to the paper in due time brought a sovereign  but
at the same time a chilling notification to the effect that the editor did not
need further contributions and would let mr john know if at any future
time he required his services

   it was the abrupt closing of one door of promise still jeffreys with
hope big within him did not sit and fret

   literary work might yet be had and meanwhile bodily labor must be
endured

   towards the beginning of december any one taking up one of the
london penny papers might have observed had he been given to the study
of such matters three advertisements here they are in their proper order 

    should this meet the eye of john jeffreys late private secretary to a gentleman
in cumberland he is earnestly requested to communicate with his friend and late em-
ployer

   readers of the agony column were getting tired of this advertisement
it had appeared once a week for the last six mouths and was getting stale
by this time

   the next advertisement was more recent but still a trifle dull

covery of the said gerrard forrester or in the event of his death producing evidence
of his decease will be liberally rewarded

   the third advertisement in another column appeared now- for the first
time 

    a young man well educated and a careful student of bibliography is anxious for
literary work searches made and extracts copied-apply j a storr alley w c

   it would have puzzled any ordinary observer to detect in these three ap-
peals anything to connect them together jeffreys however glancing down
the columns of the borrowed paper for a sight of his own advertisement
started and turned pale as his eye fell first on his own name then on
forresters

   it was like a conspiracy to bewilder and baffle him at the moment when
hope seemed to be returning he had convinced himself that his one chance
was to break with every tie which bound him to his old life and to start


living it down

afresh from the lowest step of all and here at the outset there met him
two calls from that old life both of which it was hard to resist mr rim-
bolts he decided to resist at all hazards he still shuddered as he recalled the
stiff rustle of a certain silk dress in clarges street and preferred his present
privation a hundredfold even the thought of his young friend percy and
the library and mr rimbolts goodness could not efface that one over-
powering impression

   the other advertisement perplexed and agitated him more who was
this unknown person on whose behalf messrs wilkins and wilkins were
seeking information respecting young forrester  it might be scarfe or mr
frampton or possibly some unheard of relative interested in the disposal of
the late gallant officers effects he could not assist the search the little
he knew was probably already known to the lawyers yet it excited him
wildly to think that some one besides himself was in search of the lad whose
memory had haunted him for so many mouths and whom even in his most
despairing moments he had never quite given up for lost

   true he had long since ceased to believe that he was really to be found by
searching everything combined to baffle search almost to forbid it and
yet he had constantly lived iu a vague expectation of finding or hearing of
him some day accidentally and unawares but this advertisement filled him
with self reproach what right had he had to do anything to rest a day
till he had found this lost boy-lost by his fault by his sin  no wonder he
had not prospered no wonder the bad name had haunted him and dragged
him down 

   one thing was certain whether what he knew was known toothers or not
it was his duty to aid now in this new search so he wrote as follows to
messrs wilkins and wilkins

private and confidential

    the writer of this knew gerrard forrester at bolsover school two years ago and was
responsible almost wholly for the accident referred to the writer left bolsover in conse-
quence and has not seen forrester since in may of the following year he made inquiries
at grangerham forresters native place where he ascertained that tin boy had been re-
moved there from bolsover and had remained for some time with his grandmother mrs
wilcox mrs wilcox however was ordered to the south for her health and died at
torquay forrester who appears to have been a cripple and unable to help himself was
then left in charge of his old nurse who left grangerham shortly afterwards it is said in
order to take the boy to a hospital-where  one could say this is the last the writer
heard messrs w and w might do well to apply to the clergyman and wesleyan min-
ister at grangerham who may have some later news the writer would be thankful to be
of any service iu helping to find one whom he has so terribly wronged and any letter
addressed  j at jones coffee house drury lane will find him

    it should be said that when forrester was last seen only faint hopes were held out as
to his recovery even as a cripple

   an anxious time followed it was hard to work as usual-harder still to
wait the idea of forrester being after all found took strange possession of
his mind to the exclusion of all else the prospect which had seemed to
open before him appeared suddenly blocked  he could think of nothing ahead
except that one possible meeting

   so preoccupied wyas he that his own advertisement for work was forgotten
living it down



the day after it appeared he called at jones coffee house two or three
times daily and at last received the following 

    messrs wilkins and wilkins will be much obliged if the writer of the letter of the
th inst will favor them with a call on wednesday forenoon as he may be able to assist
them materially in the search in which they are engaged messrs w and w will treat
the interview as confidential

chapter xxxvi-high dudgeon

   things had not been going well with percy rimbolt since we saw him
last six or eight months ago just before jeffreys expulsion from the house
in clarges street

   mrs rimbolt had some reason to modify her self congratulations on that
occasion when percy and raby who it will be remembered had been out
riding at the time returned home

   percy returned in high spirits  his new horse had turned out a beauty
aud the canter in the park had acted like a tonic

    hullo mother   he said as his parent came into the hall to meet him
 weve had a grand time raby and i we saw the prince of wales and
w g grace and the queen and everybody and i gave raby two hundred
yards from the corner and ran her down before we were off knightsbridge
aud nearly got hauled up for furious riding i say i mean to make father
get a horse for old jeff and well go out early in the mornings when the
rows empty and try handicaps eh raby wheres jeff i say   and he
ran whistling upstairs

   his mother with some premonitory misgivings followed him

   where are you jeff she heard him shout i say mother he
added as mrs rimbolt approached  wheres jeff is he out 

   pie is said mrs rimbolt solemnly i want to speak to you
percy

    all right but i say when will he be in he said he couldnt leave
his work this afternoon i want him to see bendigo before he goes round to
the stables

   you had better tell the groom he need not wait and then please come to
- room percy said mrs rimbolt

   percy shouted down to walker to send away the horse and followed his
mother into her boudoir		

    percy my dear boy began the lady  i am sorry to say i have just
had to perform a very unpleasant duty you can hardly understand-

   what about-anything about jeff interrupted the boy jumping at
the truth

    it is it has been necessary for everybodys sake that he should leave
here  

   what thundered percy turning pale and clutching at the back of
his chair   jouve sent jeff away-kicked him out  

    come percy dont be unreasonable i-

    when did he go-how long ago  exclaimed the boy half frantic

    percy you really-


living it down

       how long ago   

   it is more than an hour since-

    percy waited to hear no more  he dashed down the stairs and shouted to
walker

     did you see jeffreys go  which way did he go 

    i didnt see-

     come and help look for him hes sure to be about tell appleby do
you hear raby i say he exclaimed as his cousin appeared in the hall
jeffs been kicked out an hour ago im going to find him  and the
poor lad with a heart almost bursting flung open the door and rushed out
into the street

    alas  it was a fools errand and he knew it still he could not endure
to do nothing he accosted the policeman at the corner of clarges street

      i say have you seen a fellow go by-about an hour ago pretty big in
a gray suit from no  

     no  thats rimbolts m p aint it 

    yes my fathers this fellow was the librarian there

    oh    said the policeman waking up    has he took much   

     no you cad  but lies been sent away by mistake and i want to find
him i say have you seen him  

     i cant say i have ive only been on the beat half an hour

    off dashed percy anxiously scanning the passersby running on all sorts
of false scents losing hope every minute

    after two weary hours he gave it up and returned home dispirited and
furious

    walker and appleby had taken much less time to appreciate the useless-
ness of the search and had returned an hour ago from a perfunctory walk
round one or twto neighboring streets

    our joung achilles terrible in his wrath would see  onenot even his
mother not even raby once or twice that evening they heard the front
door slam and knew he once more was on the lookout

   mrs rimbolt alarmed at the storm which she had raised already
repented of her haste and telegraphed to mr rimbolt to come to london

    raby bewildered and miserable shut herself up in her room and was seen
by no one

   it was a wretched night for everybody and when next morning mrs
rimbolt sitting down to breakfast was met with the news that neither
master percy nor miss raby wanted breakfast she began to feel that
the affair was being overdone

     tell miss raby i wish her to come down

    in due time raby appeared pale but composed

     raby what is this nonsense about it is unbecoming of you

     what is foolish aunt i have a headache  it is really not my fault

     surely that is not sufficient reason for leaving me here by myself when
you know that i am in trouble about percy

     poor percy said raby with a tremble in her voice  he is dreadfully
unhappy
living it down



      i think raby if instead of taking his part in all this you had some
consideration for those who have acted for the best and for your sake as well
as for others it would be more seemly

   auntie i have no idea of not being grateful to you or taking any-
bodys part against you but i am sorry for percys unhappiness

     i fear raby your sympathy is not all given to percy but if any of it
is given to mr jeffreys you had better know at once that the reason why he
has been dismissed is that he is a criminal who came here under false pre-
tenses with the most dreadful of all stains on his character

   raby looked up at her aunt with something like the ghost of a smile on
her lips

     i dont believe that auntie said she  i could never believe it
then said her aunt stiffening up wrathfully we need not discuss
the matter

   percy came down presently haggard and volcanic

    he plunged at once into the subject

     mother i want to know why jeff was sent away  

    mrs rimbolt replied pretty much in the words in which she had explained
the matter to raby

    percy undutifully laughed the words to scorn

     who told you that   he asked

    i should hardly have sent him away unless i had been satisfied there was
no doubt at all in the matter  

     but who told you  and wrhat was it he did  

    my dear boy you forget you are talking to your mother you speak as
if i were trying to deceive or wrong you what has been done has been
done for your sake  and you must be content to believe that there has been
a good reason  

     i dout believe jeffs a cad thats all i can say its either a mistake or
some one has been telling lies about him

    now percy dear try to be reasonable forget all about it are you
not going for a ride this morning the fresh air will be good for you

     i dont mean to get on bendigos back again till jeff comes back said
said he miserably   father may sell the beast i hate him  

    it was evidently no good arguing further  and the household settled down
to a three cornered sulking match till mr rimbolt arrived

    he though he concealed his feelings better was perhaps the most morti-
fied of all at the misadventure which during his absence had turned jeffreys
adrift beyond recall he had known his secretarys secret and had held it
sacred even from his wife and watching jeffreys struggle to live down his
bad name he had grown to respect aud even admire him and to feel a personal
interest in the ultimate success of his effort

   now a miserable accident which had he been at home he could have
prevented by a word had wrecked the work and the hopes of years and put
beyond mr rimbolts power all further chance of helping it on

    it was easy to guess what a reaction wxmld take place in jeffreys himself
mr rimbolt knew his man well enough to be sure that the last thing he


living it down

would do would be to venture again within reach of the family from which
he had been so ignominiously expelled to please percy whose mingled
wrath and grief it was pitiful to witness he inserted a weekly advertisement
in the papers which nothing would have surprised him more than to find
answered

   whether mrs rimbolt succeeded in concealing from her husband the
source of her information or whether he guessed it without asking it
matters little the mischief was done and with not the slightest prospect
of any one being able to undo it

   about a week after mr rimbolts return when all but percy were
beginning to settle down again into a semblance of their old order of things
raby knocked at her uncles door and inquired if he was busy she looked
happier than he had seen her since his return the reason was easy to
guess the post had brought her a letter from her father

    i thought you would like to see it said she  he has got leave at
last and expects to be home at the end of september will you read the
letter  added she coloring   theres something else in it i should like you
to see

   the letter was chiefly about the prospects of coming home towards the
close lieutenant colonel atherton for he had got promotion wrote 

    you ask me to tell you about poor forrester and his family he had no wife alive
and when he died did not know what had become of his only son the boy was at school
in england-bolsover school-and met with an accident caused it is said by the spite of
a schoolfellow which nearly killed him and wholly crippled him he was taken home
to liis grandmothers but after she died he disappeared and poor forrester had been
unable to hear anything about him i promised forrester that when i got home i would
do what i could to find the boy and take care of him you will help wont you

   raby watched her uncle as he read the passage and then said 

   i asked father to tell me something about the forresters uncle
because some one-it was mr scarfe-had told me that he believed captain
forrester was the father of an old schoolfellow of his at bolsover who had a
bad accident

      is that all he told you    asked her uncle

    no said raby flushing he told me that mr jeffreys had been the
cause of the accident

    that was so said mr rimbolt sit down my child and ill tell
you all about it

   and her uncle told her what he had heard from mr frampton and what
jeffreys had suffered in consequence  how he had struggled to atone for the
past and wthat hopes had been his as to the future

   rabys face glowed more and more as she listened it was a different
soldiers tale from what she was used to  but still it moved her pity and
sympathy strangely

    its a sad story as your father says concluded mr rimbolt  but the
sadness does not all belong to young forrester

   rabys eyes sparkled

    no indeed said she  it is like shipwreck within sight of the harbor

    we can only hope there may be some hand to save him even from these
living it down



depths said mr rimbolt   for from what i know of jeffreys he will find
it hard how to keep his head above water of course raby i have only told
you this because you have heard the story from another point of view
which does poor jeffreys injustice

     i am so grateful to you said the girl

   mr rimbolt let her go without saying more even the man of books had
eyes that could see  and rabys face during this interview had told a tale of
something more than casual sympathy

chapter xxxvii-jeffreys champion

   the season dragged on and nothing occurred to mend matters at clarges
street

   percy moped and could settle down to nothing he spurned his books
he neglected his horse and gave up the river entirely it was vain to reason
or expostulate with him and after a couple of mouths his parents marked with
anxiety that the boy was really ill

   yet nothing would induce him to quit loudon even his fathers offer to
take him abroad for a few weeks did not tempt him

     i dont want to go thanks said he  id hate to go

     but said his father  youd be better for it  and i should enjoy the
run too

    dont you and mother stay ill be all right here raby and i can
keep house you know

    but raby would come too in fact i think we should go to venice and
meet her father there  

     all right i shall be all right here really father please i dont want
to go

     percy my boy said his father kindly  what is wrong with you 
oh you know whats wrong said the boy miserably you dont
know how i cared for jeff or how good he was to me i dont care for any-
thing now hes gone

     but is it right for you to make yourself ill and give your mother and me
such anxiety about you because of what cannot now be helped   

   oh i dont want to worry you or mother  but-we may find him after
all suppose he came back and found us all gone ill be all right here
really i will you may trust me father  only i dont want to go away
there was no moving him he yielded himself in other things more than
usual to his parents wishes he dragged himself out for occasional exercise
and made pretense of enjoying it to please them but when it came to
quitting london he was as stubborn as a rock they had to go without him
at last

    raby herself made the final appeal the dayr before theyr started

     percy dear wont you come for my sake   said she

     if i came for anybody i would for you replied he  but i cant

     but i had so looked forward to your seeing father

     ill see him as soon as he gets to town


living it down

   it will spoil my pleasure so much said she i shall be miserable
thinking of jou 

   youre an awful brick raby but dont bother about me youd all
be ever so much more miserable if i came and so should i

     but what good can it do  pleaded his cousin

   i dont know-he might turn up i might find him after all if it
hadnt been for your father coming raby-id have begged you to stay too
hed be more likely to come if he knew you were here

   raby flushed between percy and his cousin thete was no hypocrisy

   oh percy she said do you want to make me fifty times more
miserable  and she gave up further attempt to move him

   the travelers were away a mouth during wdiieh time percy kept his
lonely vigil at clarges street

    as the reader knows it was useless jeffreys was never near the place
and the lad watching day after day began slowly to lose hope

   but that months experience was not wholly wasted memories of
bygone talks with his friend of good advice given and quiet example
unheeded at the time crowded in on percys memory now adding to his
sense of loss certainly but reminding him that there was something else to
be done than mope and fret

   what would jeffreys have had him do he often asked himself  and the
answer was plain and direct-work that had always been jeffreys cure
for everything

   he got out his old books and his tools and doggedly took up the work
where he had left it it was uphill cheerless labor but he was better for it
and the memory of his lost friend became none the less dear for the relief it
brought him

   only one incident marked his solitary month at clarges street-that was
a visit from scarfe about a fortnight after the travelers had gone percy had
a very shrewd guess although he had never heard it in so many words who
it was that was responsible for jeffreys disgrace and dismissal  and that t
being so it is not to be wondered at that his welcome of the visitor was not
very cordial

   look here said he as scarfe entered and making no movement to
return his greeting is it true you were the fellow who told mother about
jeff and had him sent away from here 	

  my dear percy-

   im not your dear percy  did you tell mother that story about
jeffreys   

    why percy you dont mean to say-

    shut up  you can say yes or no cant you 

     i did my duty and its a mercy youre all rid of him   said scarfe
losing temper at being thus browbeaten by a boy of percys age

    very well you can go  youre a cad and youre not wanted here  
said percy

     you young prig   began the visitor but percy stopped him

     look here said he  if you want to fight say so and come on  if
you dont go  youre a cad  
living it down



    scarfe was staggered by this outburst  he never suspected the boy had it
in him he tried to turn the matter off with a laugh

    come dont be a muff percy  you and i are old friends-

     were not were enemies  

     you mean to say said scarfe with a snarl  youre going to throw me

up for the sake of a-

     dont say a word about jeff   said percy white hot and springing to
his feet  if you do ill have you pitched neck and crop into the street 
hook it  no one asked you here and youre not wanted  

   it was evidently useless to stay scarfe had no intention of coming to
blows he called supposing the family was at home in the hope of seeing
raby hearing only percy was iu towrn he had asked to see him and
counted now that jeffreys was out of the way on making an ally of the boy
this was the result

     i came to see your mother said he  i cant congratulate you percy
on your hospitality but i hope youll be better next time i come

   percy went out after him and called down the staircase to walker
 walker give mr scarfe some grub before he goes

   the taunt about hospitality had stung him and this was how he relieved
his conscience on that point

   the evening before the travelers were expected home walker announced
that a gentleman had called inquiring for mr rimbolt but hearing he wras
from home desired to speak with his son

chapter xxxviii-mr haegrove again

   percy ready to clutch at any straw of hope aud jumping at once to the
conclusion that the only business on which any one could possibly call at the
house was about jeffreys told walker to show the gentleman up

    he was a dark handsome man with a fewt streaks of gray in his hair and
a keen cold look iu his eye which percy mistrusted

     were old friends i fancy said he nodding to the boy as he entered

  at least i fancy i saw you sixteen or seventeen years ago  

     i must have been jolly young then said percy

    you were-about a week your father and i were college friends i
gave him up as a deserter when he married and might have cut his acquain-
tance altogether only as he happened to marry my sister i was bound to keep
up appearances and come and inspect my nephew when he made his appear-
ance

    youre my uncle halgrove then  i thought you were dead

    i sympathize keenly with your disappointment i am alive and well
and hoped to find my brother in law at home  

    theyll be back tomorrow said percy

    have you dined my boy  

     no not yet

     thats well they can lay for two ill sleep here tonight

    percy scrutinized his uncle critically
i

living it down

   look here uncle he said rather nervously  it may be all right you
know and id be awfully sorry not to be civil but i never saw you before
and didnt know you were alive so i think youd better perhaps stay at
your hotel tonight and come tomorrow when they all come home do you
mind   

   mind said mr halgrove im delighted if you are you prefer
solitude so do i or perhaps youve been a naughty boy and left behind for
your sins

    ive stayed behind because i didnt want to go said percy

    well said mr halgrove  i am sure your relatives are the sufferers
by our decision by the way one of the things i came to see -tour father
about wras to ask him to help me out of a money difficulty ive just lauded
from america and my remittances are not here- to meet me consequent
i am in the ridiculous position of not being able to pay for the luxury of a
hotel but i understand there are nice clean railway arches at victoria and
that crusts are frequently to be met with in the gutters if one keeps his eye
open  

   percy was perplexed

    do you mean joure really hard up  said he  because if you really
are of course youd better put up here

   but i may be a fraud you know i may rob the house and murder
you in your bed said his uncle  and that would be a pity

     ill take my chance of that said perc

   and so it happened that the house in clarges street had a visitor on the
last night of percys lonely month

   the boy and his uncle began the evening with a good deal of suspicion
and mutual aversion

   but it wore off as the hours passed mr halgrove had a fund of stories
to tell and the boy was a good listener  and when at last they adjourned for
bed they were on friendlj- terms

   percy however took the precaution to take away the front door key so
that the visitor could not abscond from the house during the night without
his knowledge

   he need not have worried however his uncle appeared at breakfast the
next morning and made a good meal of it by the way

    percy was in considerable difficulty as to the ceremonies to be observed in
welcoming his family home for he had no notion of leaving the house in
the possession of his suspicious uncle while he went down to the station
nor could he bear the idea of not being at the train to meet them

   so he compromised matters by taking his complaisant relative with him
much to that gentlemans amusement

   it relieved him considerably when the train arrived to see that his mother
recognized the stranger though not effusively as her veritable brother he
was thus able to devote his whole attention to his other uncle whom he
found considerably more interesting

   colonel atherton arrived in high spirits like a schoolboy home for a
holiday he struck up an alliance with percy at once and insisted on taking
living it down

i

him off to the apartments near regents park which were to be his and rabys
home for the next few months

    as he was saying good by to the rimbolts he caught sight for the first
time of mr halgrove

   why bless me is that you halgrove he said why ive worn
mourning for you my boy this is a bit of sharp practice where did you
spring from   

     perhaps im a ghost after all so many people have told me lately im
dead that i begin to believe it

     never fear if you were a ghost we should be able to see through you
-thats more than anybody ever did with halgrove eh rimbolt

    plalgrove is coming home with us said mr rimbolt so when you
and raby come tomorrow we can talk over old times  

    who would have thought of him turning up   said the colonel to his
daughter as with percy they drove off in their cab  why ive not heard

of him since that affair of poor jeffreys and-

     jeffreys   exclaimed percy with a suddenness that startled the gallant
officer  did you say jeffreys  

     yes  what about him it was loug before your time-a dozen or four-
teen years ago

     why he couldnt have been more than eight then  what happened to
him uncle i say  

    the boy asked his question so eagerly and anxiously that it was evident
it was not a case of idle curiosity

    you must be meaning the son  im talking about the father wait till
we get home my boy and you shall hear

    it required all percys patience to wait the very mention of his friends
name had excited him it never occurred to him that there were hundreds
of jeffreys in the world aud that his uncle and he might be interested in
quite different persons for him there was but one jeffreys in the universe
and he jumped at any straw of hope of finding him

    the reader knows all colonel atherton was able to tell percy and raby-
for the latter was not an uninterested listener-of the story of mr halgroves
partner percy iu turn told what he knew of his jeffreys  and putting the
two stories together it seemed pretty clear it was a history of parent and son

    colonel atherton could not fail to be impressed by the boys excitement
and agitation over the loss of his friend  and when struck by a sudden idea
he turned to his daughter and said 

     i suppose this must be the gentleman you told me about in your letter 
you never mentioned his name   the blush with which she answered that it
was convinced him that the whole affair was a serious one and wanted look-
ing into

    they talked the matter over pretty frankly and with percys assistance
the case was made pretty plain to the disconcerted parent

    karly next morning the colonel was at clarges street seated in the study
with his two old college friends

    well said he  heres a case of we three meeting again with a ven-

      l
i

living it down

geance and what have you been up to halgrove these twenty years 
no good ill be bound

    i have at least managed to keep clear of matrimony said mr halgrove

  which is more than either of you virtuous family men can say  

   ah well said the colonel with a sigh thats not all misfortune
witness my sweet daughter and rimbolts fine boy what have you got to
show against that   

    nothing i confess

    by the way though havent you the last i heard of you was iu the
papers-a record of a generous act on your part you had adopted the son of
an unfortunate partner of jrours who had died is he still with you 

    no said mr halgrove   that turned out an unfortunate speculation
in every way  

     did the boy bolt   

    not exactly i sent him to a first rate school where he distinguished
himself in a way of his own by an act of homicide

     what    exclaimed the colonel and mr rimbolt suddenly became
attentive

 yes he either quite or very nearly did for a young schoolfellow in a
fit of the tantrums and found it convenient to quit the place rather abruptly

      what was the name of the school    asked mr rimbolt quietly

    bolsover in-shire

    singular   exclaimed the colonel  i had a chum in india who had a
boy at that very school

   here the speaker became aware of a sharp kick under the table and a
significant look from mr rimbolt the old soldier was used to obey the
word of command at a moments notice and pulled up now

    i should think a thing like that would be very bad for the school
said mr rimbolt quietly and iu an offhand way

    fatal said mr halgrove  i believe bolsover went to the dogs after

it

    and so you had-you had young-what was his name 

   jeffreys

    young jeffreys on your hands 

scarcely we parted company as i told him i never was particular
but a man must draw the line somewhere and i drew it at manslaughter

      what became of him   

    wtell before i went abroad he was teacher in a dame school in york
he may be there still unless by this time all his pupils are devoured

    very unpleasant business for you said mr rimbolt

   and asked the colonel with a wink at his brother in law did he
like the prodigal take his portion of goods with him  i mean what his
father left him  

                                                                                                              f

   mr halgrove for a moment raised his brows uncomfortably

    no said he   benjamin jeffreys was an eccentric man and invested
his money in eccentric securities his sons money like the lad himself
went to the dogs and left me out of pocket by my term of guardianship
living it down



i really advise neither of you to indulge your philanthropy in adopting some-
body elses sons  it doesnt pay

   yours certainly was not a lucky experience said mr rimbolt
 however when you were last heard of fame reported that you could afford
to drop a little

    time flies and so does money no one could repeat the libel now with
truth the fact is this visit to an old college friend is a trifle interested
my journey to the west has turned out badly and greatly as i should like
it i could not offer to lend either of you fellows a hundred pounds at this
present moment so i hope you wont ask me

   the talk here took a financial turn and mrs rimbolt presently joining
the party she and her brother wtere left to themselves while mr rimbolt and
the colonel took a short stroll

   mr rimbolt took the opportunity of telling his brother in law what he
knew not only of jeffreys but of young forrester  and the colonel told him
of his obligation to find if possible the child of his dead companion in arms

     its a mixed up business altogether said he  and from all i can judge
something of a family matter my little girl rimbolt whom youve been so
good to seems to be more interested in this librarian of yours than she would
like any one to suspect-eh   

    i have fancied so said mr rimbolt  sometimes

    pleasant to come home and find everybody in the dumps about some one
one has never seen the sooner the rascal comes to light the better for
everybody and for my holiday by the way rimbolt that struck me as
fishy about jeffreys money didnt it ou 

      it did i had never heard anything about halgrove having a partner  

     i had he went out of his mind and died by his own hand  but from
what i knew of halgrove then i should say it was he who had a weakness for
eccentric speculations however the moneys gone  so its all the same for
young jeffreys 

chapter xxxix-at wilkins and wilkins

   the time passed on  and one day early in december when she returned
home rabjr found her father in an unwonted state of excitement

     theres a clew raby at last   he said

    a clew father-you mean about young forrester

    about both its the most mixed up affair i was ever in who do you
suppose has written in answer to our advertisement about forrester   

    has he replied himself  asked raby disingenuously  for she guessed
the truth

    not a bit of it the letters from jeffreys he doesnt sign his name
of course  but he writes to say he was at bolsover and was responsible for the
accident  and repeats what rimbolt knows already about his trying to hear
of him in his native place theres nothing very fresh about forrester  but
it may lead to our finding jeffreys  

    of course said raby finding it hard to conceal her emotion  he has
written to the lawyers does he give an address then   
io

living it down

    no-only a coffee house in drury dane hes evidently on his guard
against a trap he writes private and confidential but you can see he is
ready to do anything to find forrester  

    what shall you do  

    well rimbolt says leave it to the lawyers of course weve no right to
trap him and rimbolt thinks wilkins and wilkins had better not mention
our names but let him know they are acting for forresters executors if
lies not scared during the first visit or two he may consent to see me or
percy-and among us we may be able to help him out of his present condition
which to judge by his letter i should fancy is rather reduced pie has been
asked to call at wilkins on wednesday and they have promised to treat
the matter as confidential-and we shall just have to trust they will talk him
round

   percy dropped in during the evening highly excited by the news he
utterly scouted all these scrupulous precautions

    its rot i tell you  when you once get him there what you ought to
do is to shut the door aud collar the key and have raby aud me and father
hidden somewhere in the room hes bound to be caught that way

    my boy iu times of peace one doesnt catch men like rats unless
indeed the are criminals unfortunately jeffreys is not

    all i can say is said the boy  after our looking for him so long it
does seem hard lines to find him at last and no one be allowed to come near

him im certain if raby wtent-

    youre too impatient boy hell come back to us of his owii accord if
we give him time unless we do we spoil everything and shall probably
scare him away for good

      but if he knew how we wauted him   

    hasnt he seen your fathers advertisement it appeared in the same
paper which had the advertisement about forrester so he is certain to have
seen it no  depend on it if he gets the least inkling we are on his scent
liell fight shy and we shall never hear of him again

   this dreadful threat reconciled percy to patience  and so it came about
that jeffreys was not the only person wlio looked forward anxiously and
eagerly to the interview on wednesday

   little suspecting the interest which his movements were causing elsewhere
jeffreys on the appointed day presented himself at messrs wilkins and
wilkins office

   he was so much changed by eight months misery and privation that no
ordinary acquaintance would have recognized in the broken down haggard
fellow wtho entered the office the once robust and stalwart librarian of
wildtree even percy would have had to look at him twice to make sure

   however there was no one present on this occasion to cause him any
uneasiness as to the possibility of recognition the clerk in the outer office
left him standing a quarter of an hour before he deigned to look up and say 
 come be off  weve nothing for you

    i want to see messrs wilkins and wilkins

    i dare say you do so do a lot of fellows i tell you its no use your
waiting  
living it down



    i have an appointment said jeffreys producing the letter

    the clerk looked at it hurriedly and said 

    aud why on earth didnt you say you had you were expected here a
quarter of an hour ago here come this way

   aud he led the way to a room in which an elderly gentleman was seated
writing

     here is the man you expected sir said the clerk

   mr wilkins looked up curiously at his visitor

    ah said he  you have called iu reference to that advertisement about

forrester quite so let me see i have your letter here mr-

   it is not necessary to know my name said jeffreys

   just as you please of course as you say you were at bolsover school
with forrester and were the cause of his accident it is liardl worth while
making a mystery of it  

      i forgot that my name is john jeffreys  

    thank you it is a very proper thing of you to offer to assist us in
our search aud i shall be glad if in the end you should become entitled to the
reward which has been offered

     i would not touch a farthing of it said jeffreys with a scorn that as-
tonished the lawyer

    well thats your affair i can understand you have some remorse for
what has occurred and would be glad to help reward or no reward

     i would give my life to find young forrester has anything been heard
of him  

    not much though we have been able to trace him rather farther than
you did we found a day or two ago a mention of the case of a lad suffer-
ing from the results of an accident such as he appears to have met with iu
one of the medical papers at the time the case was reported as having been
treated at the middlesex hospital and i find on inquiry there that in decem-
ber of that year gerrard forrester was a patient under treatment for some
months and in the may following was discharged as incurable that you
see was more than eighteen months ago

    jeffreys felt his heart thump excitedly as he listened it was little enough
but it seemed at least to bring him six months nearer to the object of his
search

   after that said mr wilkins we are unable to discover anything
the address entered against his name in the hospital books which was prob-
ably that of his old nurse cannot now be found as the street has been pulled
down a year ago and no one recollects him i saw the surgeon at the hos-
pital who remembered the case and he explained to me that the boy when
he left there might have lived a month or twenty years in any case lie
would always have to lie on his back it would be possible he said for him
to use his hands-indeed he believed during the last wyeek or two of his stay
in the hospital lie had amused himself with drawing  

    he was considered good at drawing at bolsover put in jeffreys

    so he may possibly have been able to earn a living of some sort the
strange thing is that he does not appear to have written to any one he


living it down

might have communicated with his former head master or some of liis grand-
mothers friends at grangerham but he has not according to colonel-to
my clients account he does not appear to have written to his father though
it is possible a letter may have miscarried there you have heard no doubt
that his father died in action in afghanistan in january  

       yes i heard that-very gallantly  

     yes in fact the boy would i believe if he could be found be entitled
 to a pension besides what little property his father left the account of the
 action as well as our advertisements has been in the papers if gerrard is
 alive he is probably somewhere beyond the reach of the press and for my
 owu part i cannot see how he can be in any but destitute circumstances
 thiswas all there was to say but mr wilkins task was not yet done
 he had been instructed to ascertain if possible something of jeffreys
 present condition and to sound him as to his willingness to see again some of
 the friends of his old life

     i am afraid said he  you too have had reverses mr jeffreys

     never mind me please replied he

    you are living near here  

     no

     you must excuse me if i take an interest in you-as a former school-
 fellow of young forresters you have come through much since then 

     not more than i deserve said jeffreys fidgeting

     my client i think would have been glad to see you but as ou made a
 point of this interview being confidential i was not justified in asking him to
 be present

     oh no i dont want to see any one

     it would be a great help to my client who is a stranger in london if
 you who know forrester would assist him

     who is jtour client may i ask 

     my client said mr wilkins resolved to make the venture is a
 colonel atherton an old comrade of captain forresters who has under-
 taken to try and find the boy and provide for him

     jeffreys started and replied 

      no  i will do anything to help by myself but i do not wish to meet
  him

     you know him then  

     no i have never seen him

     he would i can promise respect your confidence mr jeffreys

     i know but i cannot meet him or any one i will do anything he wants
 about searching for forrester-he cannot be more anxious than i am-but i
 have every reason for wishing to remain unknown  

 -- you forget that it is hardly possible he can fail to know your name  and
 he has friends some of whom i believe are deeply interested in your wel-
 fare  

    jeffreys shuddered

     i caut say more said he  i will do all i can but i want to see no-
 body but jtou
living it down

    i may of course report this interview to my client

    of course  i cant prevent that

    and i must tell him you definitely refuse to meet him

    yes i cannot see him

      or tell him your address   

    no  you know where a letter can find me

    well wtill you call again-say this day week  

    yes  to see you alone

   thus the unsatisfactory interview ended

   mr wilkins was a man of honor and felt he had uo right to insist on
jeffreys opening communications witli the colonel  still less had he the right
as he might easily have done to track his footsteps and discover his hiding
place

   jeffreys alive to a sense of insecurity evidently expected the possibility
of some such friendly ruse for he returned to his work by a long circuitous
course which would have baffled even the cleverest of detectives

chapter xl-a brand from the burning

   jeffreys seriously debated with himself that night the desirability of
evacuating his garret at storr alley and seeking lodgings somewhere else
his old life seemed hemming him in  and like the wary hare he felt the in-
clination to double on his pursuers and give them the slip

   for rightly or wrongly he had convinced himself that the one calamity
to be dreaded was his recapture by the friends in whose house his bad name
had played him so evil a revenge

   yet how could he leave storr alley  had he no ties there 

   was it not worth worlds to him to hear now and then on his return at
night some scrap of news of the ministering angel whose visits cheered the
place in his absence  he shrank more than ever from a cliauce meeting 
but was it not a pardonable self indulgence to stay where he could hear and
even speak of her 

   nor was that his only tie now

   mrs pratt in the room below had never recovered yet from the illness
which prostrated her at little annies death  and night by night jeffreys had
carried the two babies to his own attic in order to give her the rest she
needed and watch over them in their hours of cold and restlessness

   he became an expert nurse he washed and dressed those two small
brethren-the eldest of whom wras barely three-as deftly and gently as if he
had been trained to the work and he manipulated their frugal meals and
stowed them away in his bed with all the art of a practical nurse

   how could he desert them now

   how indeed  that very night as he sat writing with the little pair
sleeping fitfully on the bed a head was put in at the door and a voice said in
a whisper   poor mrs pratts gone john

    what he said  is she dead 

    yes-all of a sudden-the art done it-i knowd she was weak there


living it down

poor dear-and her usband such a bad un too and they do say she was
be ind with her rent  

   so the woman chattered  and when at last she went jeffreys glanced
at his two unconscious charges and went on writing

    no he could not leave storr alley

    in the morning as usual he performed their little toilets and announced to
the elder that his mother had gone away and they might stay upstairs
whereat the little orphan wtas merry and executed a caper  the bare floor

   a fresh dilemma faced the newly made father he must work if he aud
his family were to eat the thirty shillings he had earned last week could
not last forever indeed the neighbors all seemed to take it for granted he
would see to mrs pratts burial  and how could he do otherwise

   that meant a decided pull on his small resources for a day or two he
might live on his capital and after that-

   he put off that uncomfortable speculation the baby began loudly to
demand its morning meal  and the three year old having run through his
mirth began to whimper for his mother altogether jeffreys had a busy time
of it

   so busy that when about midday tim who had been perched up on a
box at the window to amuse himself at the peril of his neck by looking out
into the court below suddenly exclaimed

      there she is   he bounded from his seat like one electrified and for
the first time realized that she might come and find him 

    there was bar el y a chance of escape she had already entered the house 
and he became aware of the little flutter which usually pervaded the crowded
tenement house when she set foot iu it

    she had many families to visit and each grudged her to the next

   what could he do wait and face her and perhaps meet her look of
scorn or worse still of forgiveness or hide from her 

   he debated the question till he heard her enter the chamber of death
below

   with a groan he gathered together his papers aud bidding tim mind the
baby till he returned seized his hat aud hurried from the room

   he went out miserably into the street and waited within view of the
entrance to the alley till she should come out it was long before she
appeared-he guessed how those two friendless little orphans would detain
her when she came her veil was down and iu the crowd on the pavement
he lost sight of her iu a moment yet he knew her aud all his resolution
once more wavered as he reflected that he was still within reach of her voice
and her smile

   he returned anxiously to the attic the baby lay asleep on the bed and
tim perched on his window seat was crooning over a little doll

   there was a flower on the table  the scanty furniture iu the room had
been set in order and his quick eye noticed that a rent iu tims frock which
had caused him some concern in the morning had been neatly mended

    tim came and put the little doll into his hands

    she gave it me will she come soon again  said the child
living it down

    yes  shes sure to come again

    you ran away you was afraid i wasnt

   in a strange turmoil of emotion jeffreys resumed his writing the flower
in the cup beside him was only a half withered aster yet it seemed to him to
perfume the room

   till midnight he labored  then cold and wearied he put out his little
candle and laid himself beside the children on the bed

   he had scarcely done so when he became aware of a glare at the window
which brought him to his feet in an instant it was a fire somewhere

   his first panic that it might be iu the house was quickly relieved it was
not even in storr alle but in one of the courts adjoining he looked down
from his window the alley was silent and empty no one there evidently
had et had an alarm

   quickly putting  his boots he hurried down and made his way iu the
direction of the flames from below they were yet scarcely visible and he
concluded that the fire wherever it was must have broken out in the top story
drivers court which backed on to storr alley with which it was connected
at the far end by a narrow passage was an unknown land to jeffreys the
jews in storrs had no dealings with the samaritans in drivers  for storr
alley poor as it might be prided itself on being decent and hard working
whereas drivers-you should have heard the stories told about it it was a
regular thieves college a stranger wdio chanced into drivers with a watch
chain upon him or a chink of money iu his pocket or even a good coat upon
his back might as soon think of coming out by the way he entered as of
flying there were ugly stories of murders and mysteries under those dark
staircases and even the police drew the line at drivers court and gave it the
go by

   jeffreys had nothing to apprehend as he rushed down the passage he
had neither watch chain nor money nor good coat his footsteps echoing
noisily iu the midnight silence brought a few heads to the windows and
almost before he stood in the court there was a cry of  fire  

   terrible anywhere such a cry in a court like drivers was awful indeed
i a moment the narrow pavement swarmed with people shouting cursing
and screaming although even yet the flames scarce appeared from below
a panic set in which it was hopeless either to remove or control chairs
tables mattresses were flung it seemed at random from the windows
mothers not venturing out on to the stairs cried down to those below to
catch their children drunken men suddenly roused reeled fighting and
blaspheming into the court thieves plied their trade even on their panic
stricken neighbors and fell to blows over the plunder

   still more terrible was the cry to others who remained within

   children huddled into corners heard that crjr and it glued them where
they stood the sick and the crippled heard it and made one last effort to
rise and escape even the aged and bedridden deserted by all when they
heard it lay shouting for some one to help

   the flames pent up at first and reddening the sky sullenly through the
smoke suddenly freed themselves aud shot up in a wild sheet above the
i

living it down

court the crowd below answered the outburst with a hideous chorus of
shrieks and yells and surged madly towards the doomed house

   there was no gleam of pity or devotion in those lurid upturned faces
to many of them it was a show a spectacle  to others a terrible nightmare
to others a cruel freak of providence calling forth curses

   the flames spreading downwards had already reached the second floor
when a window suddenly opened and a woman with wild disheveled hair
put out her head and screamed wildly

   the crowd caught sight of her and answered with something like a jeer

     its black sal some one shouted   shes kotched it at last

    why dont you jump   shouted another

    booh   shouted a third  who skinned the cripple 

   the woman gave a scared look up and down the flames at that moment
wrapped round the window and with a wild howl the crowd saw her disap-
pear into the room

   jeffreys all this time had been standing wedged in the crowd a spectator
of that hideous scene and now a witness of this last tragedy

   with a desperate effort he fought his way to the front hitting right and
left to make himself a passage it was a minute before he got through
then the crowd realizing as if by intuition his purpose staggered back and
raised a howl as lie dashed into the door of the half consumed building

   the first flight of steps was still intact and he was up it in a moment 
but as he dashed up the second the smoke-swirled down in his face and half
choked him he groped-for it was impossible to see-in search of the door 
and guided partly by the roar of the crowd without and partly by the shrieks
within he found the room

   it was full of flame as he entered it and to all appearance contained
nothing else the wretched woman finding the stairs worse to face than the
window had rushed back there and flung herself desperately on the heads of
the crowd below

   as he turned to save himself jeffreys amid the roar of the flames caught
the sound of a shout from the corner of the room which he had imagined to be
empty

   rushing toward it he made out the figure of a lad on the floor blackened
with smoke and evidently unable to move

    yet he was not senseless for he called

    i cant walk-help me

   jeffreys caught him in his arms in a moment and only just in time he
had literally to wade through flame to the door  and when he reached the
stairs outside the dense smoke reddening every instant burst upon him well
nigh overwhelmingly

   how he staggered down that awful flight with his burden he knew not
more than once he stumbled  and once a shower of falling embers all but
stunned him it was all done in a minute

   those who watched without marveled how soon he returned  and when
they perceived that he bore in his arms a living creature even drivers court
swayed back to let himpass and cheered him
jems way



   happily a cry of engines   at the other end of the court diverted the
crowd still further and enabled him to stagger forward clear of danger

    drop him hes a dead un shouted some one who stopped a moment to
peer into the face of the senseless lad

    ill give jou a shilling to help me with him out of this said jeffreys

   it was a shilling well spent unaided he could never have done it but
with the sturdy gladiator to clear the way he was able at last to reach the
comparative seclusion of storr alley

   the offer of another shilling prevailed on the man to carry the lad to the
attic

   then for the first time left to himself he looked in the face of this
unexpected guest and as he did so the room seemed to swim round him
he forgot where he was or what he was he looked down on an upturned
face but not one blackened with smoke it was white and livid with green
grass for a background-and the roar he heard was  longer the distant yell
of a panic stricken mob-but boys voices-voices shouting to himself 

   yes for the last time that vision rose before him then with a mighty
effort he shook off the dream and looked once more iu the face of the boy
who lay there on the floor of the storr alley garret and as he did so
young forrester slowly opened his eyes

a story of flush times in the pennsylvania coal regions-the startlingly novel way in which
jem beardsley settled scores with the man who had done him
an evil turn that could not be forgot

 uring the civil war the anthracite region of pennsylvania enjoyed a
season of unexampled aud delirium producing prosperity an extra-
ordinary demand for the coal scarcity of miners and the unusual amount of
money in general circulation combined to raise wages to astonishing figures
miners earned from ten to twenty dollars a day unused to such prosperity
they seemed intoxicated by their amazing fortune and indulged recklessly in
the wildest prodigalities gold watches were common as pocket knives
the black mine mud was tramped into costly brussels and axminster carpets
on cabin floors pianos were bought by families that did not know a note of
music champagne was a favorite drink in the saloons taking the place of
beer and brandy supplanted whisky there was much gambling few
thought of saving money for a possible   rainy day   in the future some
sober steady going old fellows however bought ground erected handsome
homes and furnished them well

   one of the provident men was jem beardsley an english miner in
wilksbarre he was an old bachelor saturnine and of powerful physique
his comrades laughed at him when he built a house but saw a method in his
madness when he brought in a wife as the completion of its handsome furnish-
is

jems way

ing she was an ignorant but very pretty girl not half his age daughter
of a poor farmer named carter beardsleys wealth dazzled her until they
were married she never saw him that he was not dressed like a banker and
uuder these circumstances lie was rather a fine looking old fellow her first
sight of him in his rough working clothes black as a negro-all but the bald
top of his head which his cap had protected and that looked like an ostrich
egg-disillusioned her and she began regretting her hast marriage

   bob aunam a vicious but good looking young miner came over from
sliandoka on a protracted spree and in some way struck up an acquaintance
with mrs beardsley if jem iu his best clothes had seemed a banker bob
looked to lucy as she saw him every day like solomon in all his glory it
did not seem possible that he was ever black and rough and he squandered
money as if he had trunkfuls of it furthermore he had the advantage of
youth on his side and was very much more entertaining than jem had ever
been

   jem was a faithful and tireless worker proud of making big bills-his
receipts being proportionate to the quantity of coal he sent to the surface-
and worked more hours per diem than any other man in the mine except his
helper that gave lucy much more leisure and loneliness than were good
for her the duties of her simple housekeeping took little of her time aud
she lacked amusement jem had bought a piano for her but she could not
play upon it-iu fact its only use was for jem to sleep on in hot nights he
found it cool

   one evening when jem came up from the mine his wife wras absent and he
had to kick in the door to get  washed up  and find some cold remnants for
a supper  but he was more anxious than annoyed something he feared
had happened to lucy kind neighbors told him that any accident to her
must probably have come close to hurting bob aunam at the same time he
had never heard of the young fellow before and now looked for him in vain
bob was gone and lucy never came back when no longer able to expect
her return jem sold his house quit work drew his money out of the bank
and disappeared it was rumored that he had enlisted as a soldier

   

   when bob auuams season of merrymaking was at an end he went back to
work in the black eagle mine at shandoka to the great rejoicing of his
helper who had been in enforced idleness during his absence but hardly
two months later that helper mysteriously disappeared a crony of his
affirmed that some unknown man had given him a thousand dollars simply to
go away to pittsburgh and stay there but nobody believed such an improb-
able story his defection was a serious matter for bob a miner must have
a helper to whom he pays a percentage upon his earnings and whether he
makes much or little depends a great deal upon the ability and industry of
that assistant good helpers were scarce the most competent ones finding
more lucrative employment as contracting miners bob therefore esteemed
it a godsend when a sturdy man giving the name of bill wells aud claiming
ample experience applied for the vacant position it was given to him and
he proved himself a very efficient man
jems way

s

   the memorable accident by which the black eagle mine was fired oc-
curred when bob and his new helper had been working together about three
weeks the flames started near the bottom of the main shaft from a care-
lessly managed forge it is said and spreading rapidly soon stopped the use
of the hoisting machinery happily there were comparatively few men in the
mine at the time and when the hoist was stopped there was still a way of
escape generally known through some old workings into the carbon king
mine

    in fact all did so escape except bob aunam and his helper who at the
time of the accident were driving a   breast   in the lowest level and at a re-
mote point word was passed back to them by fleeing mens shouts that the
mine was burning bob dropped the drill he was holding and sprang to his
feet with a cry of alarm but before he could take to his heels the helper
caught his arm and asked  what are you going to do 

     get up to the second level above and through to the carbon king

     no i dont think you will answered bill coolly

    very far off and faintly sounded the cries of the last escaping miners

     its our only chance the hoist is sure to be stopped

     no matter bide a bit lad we want to talk a little

     talk  you blithering idiot leave go my arm or ill strike you

     ill take my chances of that come back to the breast and sit down
bobs answer was a savage blow dealt with all his force at the face of
the man holding him but it had been expected and was cleverly parried
in another second they were in a life or death struggle wrestling and
striking ferociously the miner believed himself dealing with a madman
the helper knew he was battling against the courage of terror the
latter although the elder man was stronger cooler and soon proved himself
the best wrestler by a   grapevine lock   he dashed his antagonist to the
ground with stunning force and then while sitting on him tied his feet
firmly together and bound his hands behind his back with a strong cord he
had ready in a coil when bob recovered consciousness he was helpless
and jem was throwing water in his face to revive him

     what in thunder are you trying to do  he demanded

    the helper emptied his cap of the water with which he had been sprinkling
bobs face put it  his head and replied as calmly as before  we want to
talk a little

     ill listen to you a month if youll let us get out of this first are you
such a fool you dont understand our escape is liable to be cut off any
minute   

    i expect it will i only want to improve this chance for getting ac-
quainted before its too late my name isnt bill wells its jem beardsley
bob uttered an exclamation of horror

     yes continued the helper jem beardsley whose wife you stole

 i didnt steal her she came along of her own accord just because she
wanted to she begged to come i didnt know you i never saw you i
thought she was a widow she told me she was i swear to heaven she did
jem did not interrupt him but when he ceased speaking answered 


jems way

thats a lie and you know it and shouldnt swear to it not that it
matters anything to me  but youll be held to account for it before this day
is over  

    forgive me jem id never have done it if id known you i swear i
wouldnt ill give her back to you

    ive no use for her any more neither have you but hear me say
this to you lad if youd honestly fell in love with her and meant well by
her according to your lights she being youug and foolish and naturally more
taken with a younger man-which i ought to have had sense enough to ex-
pect-and you d been good to her after you got her away from her home and
her good name and dependent on you alone i would have gone off without
saying a word and youd never have heard of me again ive watched you to
see if i could find that excuse for jou it wasnt there youre a selfish
brute and as such youve treated her youve made her life bitter with your
bad tongue aud only last sunday night you blacked her eyes

     i was drunk then jem or i wouldnt ill never do it again

   no you will not

     why do you say that in such a way  do you mean to murder me 
help help murder

    jem waited placidly until the echoes of the terrified wretchs yells died
away and were succeeded by a profound stillness when remarking  i guess
weve got the mine to ourselves shouting wont do you much good he
listened a moment more and then replied   no it wont be murder

     ill give you fifteen hundred dollars all ive got and my notes secure
for as much more if youll let up  me

     im not selling ducy

    give me a fair chance let me up and give me a show to fight for my
life

    what for youre no match for me it would just be to give myself
the trouble of dowming you again and thats not worth while

   youre afraid youre a coward help murder you mean to
cut my throat while my hands are tied murder   and as he shrieked he
writhed and tugged vainly at the wire-like cord that bound him

    whats the good of exciting yourself and going on in that way  you
cant break that cord i picked it out and have carried it two months for
tou and i told you thered be  murder when i set out to look for you
i took a vow that if i was let find you i wouldnt kill you  id do no more
than insure natural circumstances having a chance at you that i swore to
and i mean to keep my oath the circumstances are here aud i mean to
keep you face to face with them until they not i make an end of you

     the air seems to be getting sort of thick i shouldnt wonder if they
had covered the up take with timbers and earth to cut off the draught and
smother the fire and of course the fans are stopped that would be
enough to make the ventilation bad  

     if you dont let me go youll never get out alive yourself you dont
know the way to the carbon king and i do stop your cursed fooling
mighty soon or youll die with me
jems way



      i expect to  

    bob poured forth a torrent of abject prayers wild invectives blasphemies
and agonized shrieks for help jem deliberately lighted his pipe and listened
tranquilly without reply after a time he noticed that water was rising
about him and bob in the chamber which was considerably above the level of
the tunnel   hello   he exclaimed   the pumps have stopped and this
level is filling he went out a little way and found the water up to his
knees and rising rapidly  they must be trying already to flood the mine
thats prompt work he commented returning he lifted bob upon his
shoulder and carried him and the lantern wading mid-leg deep a long dis-
tance to a steep incline up which he toiled to the next level

   jem pleaded bob huskily you may have a right to take your revenge
 me but you dont want to harm them that never did anything to you
think of my parents it would break my mothers heart to have her boy
die down in the mine and my poor old father would never get over it

    danny brennan has known you since you were a kid youve done
time for beating your poor old father who never wants to see or hear of you
again and your mother died of a broken heart on our account before you
were of age what a miserable cowardly shallow liar you are  why
dont you brace up and since youve got to die-and you have this day so
sure as god hears us-try to meet death like a man 

     oh  jem im not fit to die

     im  judge of that all im sure of is that youre not fit to live

    their colloquy was violently interrupted by a terrific explosion that really
took place in some upper level of the labyrinthine mine but seemed to be
everywhere it had almost the effect of an earthquake huge pillars of
coal cracked with reports like artillery and great pieces flew from their
sides like missiles fired from guns  vast masses of roof rock fell with awful
crashes sending thunderous echoes rumbling down the cavernous depths of
the mine  a tornado-like wind roared through the tunnels bursting open the
ventilation doors hurling empty coal cars from their tracks tossing the two
men as ocean waves toss floating oars

   when jem came to himself after a period of unconsciousness he was
bruised bleeding iu perfect darkness and could not find his companion any-
where near again and again he called   robert  where are you   
there was no reply although bob heard him lie held his breath and was
still he hoped his implacable enemy might not discover him before a res-
cuing party came

    jem reflected standing iu the tunnel he had caught the full force of the
wind while bob lying along the wall had probably been less its sport the
lamp was irretrievably gone but jem was too old a miner to be without the
means of making a light in a tightly corked bottle he carried matches and
he had a bit of caudle in a pocket after the great wind succeeded such
stillness that the air seemed to have died the caudle flame rose straight
from the wick as if burning in a closet holding it above his head he re-
traced the way along which he had been thrown and soon discovered the man
he sought who groaned audibly in despair at his recapture


jems way

    that remarked jem as one who states a fact but without feeling any
personal concern in it is probably the beginning of the end the choke
damp should soon begin to settle now and placing the candle on the tun-
nel floor he seated himself comfortably to watcli it i wish i hadnt lost
my pipe he grumbled

   bob renewed his supplications weeping protesting and praying in an
agony of craven fear without eliciting a word of reply

   the flame suddenly vanished

    jem groped for the candle picked it up and made haste to lift the helpless
man upon his shoulder again he held him there steadied against the wall
while he relighted the caudle then moving slowly and cautiously he went
from chamber to chamber farther down the long tunnel

   not this way  turn back for the love of heaven you are getting
farther away from the up drift   shrieked the burden struggling hard to free
himself

   yes i know replied jem at length he found what he sought a
chamber where the first cut had been made across the top of the breast instead
of at the bottom a variation sometimes necessitated by exceptional conditions
a broad bench of coal was left at a height of about four feet from the floor
upon it he laid bob shoving him well back and seated himself on the edge
with his legs dangling down the roof was so low that he had to sit in a
half reclining position resting his weight upon an elbow the candle he set
near the edge of the bench not far from bobs face

   the young man began to feel hope that jem only meant to frighten him
almost to death and would yet at the last moment let him escape but with
that hope mingled a sickening fear that that last moment might be too long
delayed

   whats the use of climbing up here he protested if the choke
gets this high well never get out alive why didnt you let me be on the
floor if you meant to kill me this way   

   if i could lad id keep thee for a month just arms length from death
and atlast-let him clutch thee

   robert abandoning hope raved and wept

   how long they waited neither knew

   suddenly the invisible fingers of approaching death again pinched out the
little flame and bob uttered a scream of terror

    jem quickly tore off his jacket rolled it into a bundle and thrust it as a
pillow under the miners head then he once more lighted the candle and
held it up  not long to wait now he said coolly

   presently bob struggled and gasped for breath heaved himself upon one
elbow and cried   mercy  air   

   jem looked at him with calm interest silently forgetting in the absorp-
tion of his regard to keep the candle above the rapidly rising tide of deadly
gas and for the third and last time its light was extinguished he did not
trouble himself to find another match bob was quiet and still at last

    after a little jem fell backward
