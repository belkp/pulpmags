do you want  a week

   the amazing story of how carl a rowe jumped
   from  to  a month

  my name is rowe-carl rowe i live in a small
city in new york state

  i am going to tell you an amazing story about
myself it may seem too strange to believe but
you can easily verify everything i have to say

  two years ago i was a baker i was struggling
along trying to make the money in my pay-en-
velope meet the increasing expenses of our family
there was no prospect for the future

  today just twa years later i am a successful
business man i have plenty of money for all t le
things we need and want last month i macle
 during my spare time and
was able to put  a week in my
savings account

  and im going to tell you how
it happened

  please remember that two years
ago i had no surplus cash i was
in the same fix as nine out of ten
other men expenses were con-
stantly mounting and my salary
although it had increased could
not keep pace with the cost of liv-
ing my wife had to do without
things that i knew she ought to
have we wanted an automobile
but we couldnt afford it we
wanted to buy our own home but
couldnt afford that

  it made me desperate to think
of what might happen if i became
sick or lost my job i worried about
it and so did my wife we were living from hand
to mouth and we didnt know what calamity and
hardships might be lurking just around the corner

  and yet-today-i own our nine-room house
i have an automobile i have money for books
the theatre or any other pleasures that i may want
i have the cash today to educate my son and send
him through college

  here is how it happened one day in glancing
through a magazine i read an advertisement the
advertisement said that any man could make from
a hundred to three hundred dollars a month during
his spare time

  i didnt believe it i knew that i worked hard
eight hours a day for  a week and i figured that
no man could make that much during a couple of
hours a day spare time

  but as i read that ad i found that it pointed
to men who had made that much and more in the
last paragraph the advertiser offered to send a book
without cost i still doubted but i thought it
was worth a two-cent stamp so i tore out the
coupon and put it in my pocket and the next day
on my way home from work i mailed it

  when i look back to that day and realize how
close i came to passing up that ad it sends cold
chills down my spine if the book had cost me a
thousand dollars instead of a two-cent stamp it
would still have been cheap all that i have today

-an automobile my home an established business
a contented family-all these are due to the things
i learned by reading that little eight-page booklet

  there is no secret to my success i have suc-
ceeded beyond any dream i may have had three
years ago and i consider myself an average man
i believe that i would be criminally selfish if i did
not tell other people how i made my success

  all the work i have done lias been pleasant and
easy and withal amazingly simple i am the rep-
resentative in this territory for a raincoat manufac-
turer the booklet that i read was one issued by
that company it tells any man
or woman just what it told me
it offers to anyone the same oppor-
tunity that was offered to me it
will give to anyone the same success
that it has brought to me

  the comer manufacturing com-
pany are one of the largest man-
ufacturers of high-grade raincoats
on the market but they do not
sell through stores they sell
their coats through local representa-
thes the local representative
does not have to buy a stock-
he does not have to invest any
money all he does is take orders
from comer customers and he gets
his profit the same day the order
is taken fully half of my cus-
tomers come to my house to give
me their orders

  my business is growing bigger every month
i dont know how great it will grow but there are
very few business men in this city whose net profit
is greater than mine and i can see only unlimited
opportunity in the future

  

  if you are interested in increasing your income
from  to  a month and can devote all
your time or only an hour or so a day to this same
proposition in your territory write the comer
manufacturing company at dayton ohio simply
sign the attached coupon and they will send you
the eight-page booklet referred to by mr rowe
and full details of their remarkable proposition

  his job

 by robert c simpson

the true story of the water boy
who became superintendent of
the electrical department of a
 corporation

  boy boy

  above the din of the great mill came
that raucous voice-commandingly im-
patiently almost threateningly

  a slim little boy picked up his bucket
and wearily answered the call

  that slim little boy was bill al-
bright twenty years ago-a water
carrier in the old puddle mill of the
cambria steel mills at johnstown
pennsylvania

  but albright was not the kind of boy
or man to let temporary obstacles hold
him down yes im a water boy to-
day he admitted to himself but
tomorrow ill be something better so	-

he worked hard and long he was promoted
from one small job to another until he became
assistant roller in the no  rail mill and then
one happy day he was advanced to the chemical
laboratory where he remained three years

  for a time he was well satisfied but he soon
began to realize that he had reached the end of
the road in his particular work-that no matter
how hard or long he worked he would never
get much farther without education

  and the more he thought about it the more
he realized that to achieve the kind of success he
dreamed of he must have special training-he
must learn to do some one thing well

  so one night he sent in that familiar coupon
to the international correspondence schools-just
as so many other ambitious men have been doing
for the last thirty years

  some of his fellow workers laughed as they
saw him studying in his spare time and made all
manner of fun of his trying to get an education
by mail but albright kept steadily on

  his ability to do things attracted the attention
of his superiors and albright was given one pro-
motion after another until finally he was ap-
pointed general foreman of the electrical de-
partment of the same cambria steel mills for
which he had once worked as a water boy

  his career since has been a steady climb from
the cambria steel he went to the borough elec-
tric plant at conemaugh pa as assistant engi-
neer-thence to the citizens light heat and
power company of johnstown pa as general
superintendent from there he went to the
federal light and power company of colorado
and today william j f albright who was once
bill albright the water boy is superintendent
of the electrical department of the united alloy
steel corporation of canton ojlio-a concern
employing  men and capitalized at 

  thousands of men like albright now know the
joy of happy prosperous homes because they let
the international correspondence schools pre-
pare them in spare hours for bigger work and
better pay you will find them in offices shops
stores factories-everywhere

  why dont you study some one thing and get

ready for a real job at a salary that will give
you the comforts-yes and the luxuries you
would like to have

you can do it pick the position you want in
the work you like best and the i c s will pre-
pare you for it right in your own home in your

long the border from the gulf of

stretches a land which has been the
setting for uncounted songs and
stories and the scene of numberless life-and-
death dramas more romantic more deadly
more human than words on paper can con-
vey in the days of the old west the rio
grande the pecos the big bend the deserts
-all were names fraught with meaning be-
cause they brought with them associations
of a pioneer country where men of the out-
doors fought their way against nature and
each other by the rudimentary law of the
individual

  today in the twentieth century that
same land still stubbornly resists the march
of cities and factories and blossoming farms
there are hundreds of miles of mesquite
wilderness where a man can wander for
days without food or water the big bend
vast and forbidding still harbors men whom

a none too particular country has outlawed
the flaming deserts of the far southwest
are deadly as of yore and the struggle of
the border is going on as it was fifty years
ago-not so open a struggle perhaps but
still raw and elemental

  there are still men along the border who
prize their ability to draw and shoot and
ride as priceless because those things mean
life to them the smuggler the bandit
the gunman the outlaw-they are still
there and a handful of men who represent
the law of a great country fight them
ofttimes hand to hand or gun to gun

  and yet that same land last outpost of
the old pioneer days is spanned by a thread
that represents the peak of civilizations

adventure

the army air service border patrol keep
watchful eyes on the tempestuous land
below

  civilization has sent the fruits of its most
recent conquest to span the border and the
armys youngest branch of the service has
sent its best to man them whether the
airdromes of the patrol lie in the heart of
the big bend like marfa and sanderson or
whether they be near douglas or el paso
the airplanes and the men who fly them have
but one duty-to watch unceasingly the
seething border country

  the mcmullen flight of the patrol counted
themselves unusually fortunate mcmullen
was a live progressive town which was
proud that the flight was located there and
showed it and in recent months their
pride had been justified to an unusual
extent if notoriety counted for anything
the mcmullen flight had become very
prominent largely through the instrumen-
tality of one lieutenant lee macdowell bet-
ter known as tex who was a young man
possessed of a boundless facility for getting
into scrapes that was only exceeded by his
ability to get out of them with much credit

  this particular afternoon he was engaged
in one of his favorite devices for pass-
ing leisure moments pleasurably namely
arousing the ire of pop cravath adjutant
of the flight

  cravath was older than the other officers
of the group by several years and his years
had not taught him to dissemble wrath at
the slightest provocation he would burst
forth into a series of crackling remarks and
blistering expressions of a distinctly blas-
phemous trend that caused his comrades
to sit back in open-mouthed admiration
withal he was much the most conscientious
and precise member of the group the c o
included

  recently he had taken a notion to learn
something about meteorology mcmullen
was equipped with instruments and a few
trained enlisted men wherewith to gain in-
formation in advance about the weather
one of the meteorological sections daily
duties was to send up large hot-air balloons
which they studied through a theodolite as
they sailed aloft thereby figuring the direc-
tion and velocity of the wind at different
altitudes by this data the flyers were able
to know the exact altitude at which the wind
would help them most or hinder them least
cravath had been diligently studying the

intricacies of meteorology of late and today
he was going to make the balloon observa-
tions himself

  the shack used by the weather experts
faced the rear of the recreation building
tex macdowell armed with an ordinary
slingshot and some bb shot watched the
door of the shack closely from the recreation
hall the window curtains screened him
a half-dozen airmen were with him waiting
with much anticipation

  cravath appeared at the door of the
shack tenderly holding a large red balloon
completely inflated tex quickly stooped
and sighted his slingshot through a con-
venient knot-hole taking careful aim he
let go and a satisfying smack from without
was the result

  -it yelled cravath surveying the

tattered remains in his hands with much
disgust

  he disappeared into the shack once more
for another balloon

  he reappeared shortly his new balloon
bobbing about as he held it with meticulous
care once again tex fired and was re-
warded with another loud report of bursting
rubber and a truly remarkable series of
expletives from the adjutant

  the men inside strangled their laughter
with their hands until pop had disappeared
once more into the weather sanctum

  the next time he comes out hes going
to have a stroke chuckled binder ill
bet he swears for half an hour and never
says the same thing twice

  pop sure hasnt learned to guard what
his tongue saith remarked tex keeping
a wary eye on the door opposite

  little pete miller suddenly exploded
without warning into a loud laugh expelling
clouds of cigaret smoke which caused him
to cough and laugh at the same time

  i was just thinking of how pop bawled
out sergeant roper the other day when
three defective balloons burst in succes-
sion he explained

  captain kennard c o of the flight
strolled into the room

  whats the excitement he enquired
as he surveyed the group

  sh-h-h cautioned big george hickman
with uplifted hand

  cravath was once more emerging into the
sunlight walking as if on eggs and holding
the balloon as if it were the most precious
of possessions tex allowed him to take
feuds end



three or four steps toward the observation
tower before he shot once more

  this time the bursting balloon stung
cravaths fingers his comrades weak with
suppressed mirth listened delightedly while
the fiery adjutant launched into a compre-
hensive survey of balloons meteorology and
anything or anybody connected with the
same he soared to truly awe-inspiring
heights of verbiage

  captain kennard finally composed him-
self sufficiently to ask-

  who conceived this idea-you tex

  tex looked down from his six-foot-two
into the twinkling eyes of the stocky cap-
tain

  i admit it with pride he grinned
boy did you see him hop when the last one
hit him

  i heard it anyway laughed the c o
well its time for officers meeting

  the little company filed out of the room
and across into the captains office the
remainder of the dozen officers who com-
posed the flight were awaiting them there-
all except cravath

  go to the meteorological shack and get
lieutenant cravath ordered the c o
and the orderly departed

  while he was gone tex explained the
reason for the mirth of the recent arrivals
cravath entered in a moment his face still
red with wrath and seated himself behind
his desk

  captain he began unceremoniously

i want to make a kick about those --

balloons three of them--

  he did not get any farther when the
officers recovered and cravath compre-
hended what had happened the dignified
adjutant decided to laugh with them he
gazed at tex lounging easily against the
wall with twinkling eyes belying his con-
temptuous expression

  if you found time hanging heavy on
your hands tex youd play with a rattle
he observed

  macdowell was a continual puzzle to
cravath-even captain kennard some-
times wondered whether he understood
tex and the captain knew human nature
the tall young flyer was such a curious
combination of boyishness and ability to
take care of himself under any circum-
stances or in any company that he some-
times seemed like two separate individuals
in one

  well lets get to business and get this
thing over said the c o cravath are
there any orders to read

  the adjutant read a couple of war de-
partment circulars which had been received
that day and then indicated that he was
through the captain settled back in the
swivel chair behind his desk and lit a cigaret
his mouth stretched in a broad grin that
made the big scar on his cheek wrinkle
deeply as he surveyed his staff of flyers and
observers he ran his hand through the
short bristly pompadour that stuck up on
his head and then shook his head sadly

  ive got bad news for you he began
not so bad for you maybe as for the boys
at donovan field its about booze

  he quickly shuffled through the papers on
his desk finally drawing out a letter -which
he glanced over as if to refresh his memory

  it seems that a few days ago a repre-
sentative of the law in san antonio acting
presumably at the instigation of some san
antonio reformers came out to donovan

field and raised - with colonel mills

about the liquor being carried from the
border to donovan field the last dance
they had was pretty well oiled with tcujuila
aguadiente and whisky i guess this
minion of the state likewise made some
cracks about there being some suspicion
that maybe some of the boys were carrying
opium up to make a little kale

  of course thats ridiculous perhaps
a border flyer now and then packs a bottle
in his suitcase and offers a drink to some of
his friends who are parching up at donovan
field but thats all

  a chuckle ran around the circle of flyers
well anyhow the captain resumed
cocking a contemplative eye at the last
smoke-ring theyre squawking about it up
around effete san antonio and orders from
headquarters are that every ship coming in
from-or back to donovan field from-
the border will be thoroughly searched and
severe disciplinary action taken on the pilot
of any ship carrying any of the demon rum

i	imagine the civilian authorities may swoop
down at any moment likewise for a little
private search

  he grinned as a thought struck him
the boys at donovan are out of luck
he remarked

  and were not going to be near as popu-
lar as we were drawled tex the last
time i landed at donovan it looked as if
adventure

they were having an officers review in my
honor

  well when you and george fly up there
tomorrow youll have a chance to see it at
first hand replied the c o

  his face became serious again

  all kidding aside fellows orders are
orders and well live up to them the rest
of the border had better do it too because

its a-cinch that-is going to pop

when they catch somebody especially if
any civilian official pokes his nose in dont
any of you get mixed up thats all

ii

a  next morning the sun rose in
a cloudless sky giving promise of
a terriffically hot day so tex and
george hickman his observer decided to
get an early start for donovan field before
the mounting sun made the flying bumpy
consequently it was only seven-thirty when
sergeant cary chief mechanic of the flight
started to warm up the big four hundred
and fifty horsepower liberty motor in mac-
dowells dehaviland plane

  tex who was engineer officer and test
pilot of the flight was to test a new de-
haviland at donovan field and fly it back
to mcmullen leaving the old ship there for
overhaul and repair it having had its
allotted number of hours in the air big
blondely handsome hickman was going
along just to take a look at san antonio and
see a show early as it was pete mills and
wallace had started on the eastern morning
patrol and binder and cravath were fifty
miles on their way westward along the rio
grande

  macdowell and hickman swinging their
helmets and goggles in their hands strolled
from the mess-hall toward the ship which
had been started and was idling gently the
air was quiet for it was too early for the
gulf breeze to be stirring the airdrome
four hundred yards square was bounded on
three sides by hangars frame barracks
mess-halls and storehouses their ship was
on the line in front of the hangars

  the roar of the motor increased as cary
slid the throttle forward a trifle the wheels
began to press against the blocks that held
them and the two mechanics who were
holding each wing set themselves to hold
the ship little by little the throttle crept
forward under the sergeants careful hand

until the man sitting on the tail to keep the
ship from nosing up was compelled to turn
his back and lean against the propellor
blast for a few seconds the noise of twelve
mighty cylinders firing in rotation was
almost deafening and then as slowly as the
motor had been turned on it was cut down
to idling

  tex and hickman fastened their helmet
straps and adjusted their goggles as cary
climbed out of the cockpit the pilot ad-
justed his belt tried both switches and
studied air oil and temperature gages
briefly he turned around and hickman
nodded that he was ready tex signalled
the mechanics who pulled the wheel blocks
there being no wind he slowly pushed the
throttle and spark ahead until both were
wide open a little pressure on the stick
and the tail came up for a hundred yards
they roared across the ground and then the
hard-packed sand dropped away beneath
them

  tex hunched down further behind the
windshield as they circled the field to es-
cape the terrific pressure of air which was
the result of their whirring propeller and
a hundred miles an hour of airspeed two
circles of the field brought them up to two
thousand feet and assured him that the
motor was running well he banked around
and headed north for the two hundred and
fifty mile grind to donovan field

  there being no particular hurry he fol-
lowed the railroad it was thirty miles
shorter to fly an airline straight across the
mesquite but along the railroad there were
a few fields which might be possible landing
places if the motor cut out to the border
patrol flyer accustomed to gamble his life
against his motor as he flew for hours
over trackless mesquite it seemed very
comfortable to have any cleared places at
all below him

  it was thoroughly characteristic of tex
to take the railroad course instead of the
airline although the average person who
knew him would expect him to take a chance
on the shorter but more dangerous route
he had won his reputation as the premier
pilot of the border by a succession of
brilliant often reckless flying achieve-
ments a dozen times his fellow pilots had
watched him stall down in a dehaviland
than which there is no more ticklish or
expert bit of flying and gasped at the chance
he was taking but in doing that he was
feuds end



depending on his ability to handle the ship

  should he take the airline to san antonio
no skill of his could save a crackup perhaps
death to both passengers in the event of
a forced landing in the thick mesquite
consequently inasmuch as there was no
need for haste he did the safest thing

  tex possessed unconsciously perhaps
a great confidence in himself that was the
result of experience and self-knowledge
minus conceit nine out of ten people who
knew him only by reputation would have
rubbed their eyes with wonder that he
should take the safest course when tex
became reckless it was a calculating reck-
lessness that depended little on the infalli-
bility of an airplane motor and much on the
flying ability of tex macdowell

  a half-hour and the ship had climbed
gradually to five thousand feet the edge
of the mesquite wilderness a hundred and
fifty miles long slipped behind them to
the left as far as the eye could see the
scrubby forest of grayish-green billowed
away to the skyline the ship was slightly
right-wing heavy but nevertheless the
sturdy motor drew it through the air at
a hundred miles an hour even though it
was throttled down to fifteen hundred
revolutions a minute once in a while tex
was compelled to pump the air which failed
to hold up to three pounds but otherwise
the old ship seemed to have escaped the
effects of age

   the last fifty miles of the trip which were
over more open country were rather bumpy
as the rapidly heating atmosphere started
currents of warm and cold air that reached
even to five thousand feet both airmen
were glad to see the level expanse of dono-
van field come into view the mile-long
rows of hangars barracks and machine
shops standing out vividly white against the
green tex started to dive when he was
still ten miles from the field throttling his
motor to twelve hundred by taking a long
gradual dive with motor partly on over-
fast cooling was prevented and the spark
plugs would not foul right to the last the
great liberty did its duty-every gage read
correctly as the big ship shot over the south-
ern edge of donovan field and the motor
went full on again

  tex circled the field at five hundred feet
to look at the landing t it was pointing
southeast he sideslipped over the hangars
and with instinctive judgment leveled out

less than two feet above the ground the
speed dropped to seventy five then to
seventy miles an hour for just an instant
the ship seemed to hover and the pilot
jerked back on the stick the tail came
down and they landed smoothly

    l as they taxied to the line oppo-
 site hangar  where visiting ships
were always taken care of the two
border pilots looked around them appreci-
atively after the small difficult airdrome
at mcmullen it was almost imposing even
to them to watch a dozen ships at a time
landing and taking off all around the mile-
square field about them

  they found a niche on the line between
a little s e  and a low-hung wicked look-
ing le pere as they climbed out lieu-
tenant harrow one of the assistant ad-
jutants and two civilians approached
quickly they were standing beside the
border ship before mechanics had a chance
to get blocks under the wheels tex nodded
to harrow and then shut off his gas flow
after a half-minute the motor gurgled and
spit and then the propeller gradually
stopped he snapped off the switches-he
had run the gas out to prevent back-firing-
and crawled out

  hello harrow he greeted the dono-
van field man who had already shaken
hands with hickman

  lo tex just got captain kennards
wire that you were on the way a few minutes
ago good trip

  came by the railroad- returned
tex expertly rolling a cigaret with one
hand while he replaced the makings in his
pocket with the other

  meet mr snow and mr crillon-lieu-
tenant macdowell and lieutenant hick-
man

  both the civilians who were middle-aged
men of commonplace appearance looked
at the airmen with considerable interest

  heard a lot about you two-in fact i
saw you in the movies stated the stouter
of the two who had a red face and a jovial
smile

  yes when george hung out on the wing
so we could land without a wheel he sure
made us matinee idols grinned tex re-
ferring to an incident that had been caught
by the camera man of a news-weekly

  well did you bring in any booze tex
inquired harrow his blue eyes twinkling


adventure

 i hope you didnt because these two chaps
 are from the department of justice in san
 antonio

   what liquor asked tex in horrified
 tones

   the stout man-crillon-looked up at
 the broad-shouldered tanned pilot apolo-
 getically macdowells mouth which ordi-
 narily had a whimsically humorous quirk
 at the corners stretched into a grin and the
 crinkles around the keen gray eyes deep-
 ened

   george are you a bootlegger he asked

   hickman shook his head

   not enough money in it he replied
 confidentially

   i dont know what got the chief started
 but orders is orders and well have to pry
 around a little lieutenant said crillon

   help yourself replied tex with a wave
 at the ship

   their suitcases were wired on the wings
 one on each side of the fuselage

   snow who had a pair of cold blue eyes
 and a cigar clamped in his mouth immedi-
 ately climbed up on the wing for a look at
 the cockpits he had not said a word thus
 far except to acknowledge the introductions

   what are you an army sleuth now
 hickman asked harrow

   representing headquarters returned
 harrow genially get those suitcases

 	unwired will you sergeant

   two of the mechanics at a word from the
 sergeant in charge of the hangar unwired
 the bags tex and hickman smoked con-
 tentedly watching the busy field idly
 scouts bombers and training-planes were
 all discernible landing and taking off and
 down the line the noise of many motors
 warming up filled the air with a low drone

   the two operatives with harrow watch-
 ing them took a brief look at the suitcases
 and then closed them

   guess you get a clean bill of health
 lieutenant said crillon

   why the sudden access of virtue around
 these parts asked tex

   harrow shrugged his shoulders

   search me

   and me added crillon this is my
 first shot at it and the chief told me noth-
 ing

   we might take this off said snow
 suddenly his hands on the turtleback which
 forms the top of the fuselage

   all right replied harrow

  at a word from him the mechanics
started knocking out the pins that held the
turtleback to the fuselage itself in a mo-
ment with hickman helping them they
lifted the wood-and-linen cover off

  well for the love of mike said hick-
man in surprized tones whats this bag
doing here

  crillon and harrow suddenly serious
untied a small canvas bag that was hung
from one of the top cross-braces of the
fuselage tex as surprized as his observer
watched snow untie the string around the
mouth of the bag and hold it upside down
a dozen tins rolled out on the ground

  opium

  it was a chorus-almost ludicrous in the
different gradations of surprize and in the
cases of harrow and hickman horror a
curious swarm of mechanics encircled the
group and a few passing officers stopped to
find out what was the matter

  snow and crillon quickly weighted the
cans they were all heavy the top was
pried off one and the dark sticky substance
inside told its own story with one accord
every one looked at the two men from
mcmullen tex and george glanced at
each other quickly in the eyes of each was
an unspoken question-and the swiftly
flashed answer was satisfactory

  well ill be-

  macdowells words were slow almost
gentle but there was a curious change in
his appearance he lounged against the
fuselage as easily as ever cigaret in hand
the half-mocking twist at the corners of
his mouth was still there but the wideset
gray eyes slightly narrowed were blazing
with what seemed like the reflection of some
inner fire there was a lot of recklessness-
a kind of fierce joy of battle there hick-
mans face was merely a still-life illustra-
tion of horrified surprize

  harrow touched the two flyers lightly on
the shoulder

  im sorry but you will consider your-
selves under arrest he said his lined face
very serious

  tex grinned although his eyes were still
shining with that savage delight in pitting
himself against he knew not what

  dont cry about it pardner he said

slowly of course those - cans are

news to us as well as to you but you cant
do anvthing else where do we go from
here
feuds end



  to the old man i guess replied har-
row do you gentlemen wish to accom-
pany us

  crillon and snow shook their heads
weve got no jurisdiction here were
just nosing around to help out of course
you understand that a full report will be
made and that if the civilian authorities
wish to press the matter providing they
are not satisfied with the action taken by
the military it will be taken up later
replied crillon

  the curious crowd of officers and men
watched harrow and the two border men
start for the c os office harrow carried
the opium repacked in the bag in some
way the news had spread ahead of them
and as they traversed the wide concrete
highway which ran between the row of
hangars and the barracks and officers
quarters excited knots of officers and men
met them every few yards

  good- tex im afraid you boys are

in a mess harrow told them as they
approached headquarters

  looks that way replied george mood-
ily of course there is only one explana-
tion tex

  tex nodded harrow looked at them
questioningly

  you mean

  fitzpatrick it would have been easy
for one of his men to get in the hangar last
night and plant the stuff

  harrow nodded

  i thought as much of course we dont
know much about what is happening down
there but a few seepings of gossip about
the little tiffs youve been having with that

old-have filtered up this way i hope

you can convince the old man tex

  im trying tex returned gently
george we sure are the prominent boys
around donovan look at that reception
committee

  twenty-five or thirty officers were grouped
around headquarters building that tex
macdowell who in a few months had be-
come the most talked-of pilot in the south
should be caught smuggling opium was an
event not lightly to be overlooked hick-
man the texans chief aid in his most
widely known flying achievement was like-
wise a famous character around donovan
although few of the donovan airmen except
the older group knew either one of the
border men

 major schaffer operations officer of the
 field hurried down the walk to meet har-
 row and his charges

 for the love of heaven tex what the

-have you been doing

 carrying opium they tell me but ill

be-if they didnt have to tell me before

 i knew it grinned tex

 going in to the colonel

 yes sir replied harrow

the tall lanky young major who had
a distinguished overseas record put his
mouth close to macdowells ears

 tex tell me straight as man to man
 do you know anything about this

 tex his blazing gray eyes belying the
 easy carelessness of his manner met the
 majors eyes squarely

not a-thing major

then you think that dave fitzpatrick
is behind it

 i know it interjected hickman as they
 mounted the steps

 the group of officers parted silently a
 fewwho knew the two flyers spoke to them
 in half-embarrassed tones all of them
 saluted the major

 harrow when you see the old man tell
 him that i would like to see him on this
 matter-that i have something of import-
 ance to say concerning it said the major
 in suddenly crisp phrases

 yes sir

 harrow disappeared into the adjutants
 office and in a few seconds came to the door
 of his own office where he had left the
 three

the colonel wants to see you right
away he said major schaffer he wishes
you to come in at the same time

 the four officers major schaffer in the
 lead filed silently into the office of colonel
 mills he was sitting at his desk signing
 papers he was a stocky gray headed man
 with a strong square-jawed countenance
 and keen blue eyes that years in the philip-
 pines and the southwest had surrounded
 with a multitude of wrinkles

the four came to salute which the
colonel returned negligently

 sit down gentlemen he said and went
 on signing papers

 he stole frequent glimpses at macdowell
 from under lowered lids as he automatically
 spread his signature on document after
 document for months gossip from the bor-
 der had indirectly reached his ears about


adventure

the man who was now lounging easily
before him shirt open around the tanned
throat and thick brown hair tousled from
the wind both tex and hickman were
oil-grimed and dirty just as they had
climbed out of their ship they carried
helmets and goggles in their hands

  finally the colonel finished and leaned
back in his chair his eyes meeting mac-
dowells squarely for the first time the
c o lit a cigaret the while he appraised
the texan with puckered eyes

  all right harrow he said at length his
eyes shifting to the assistant adjutants
face

  harrow told the story briefly and present-
ed the bag of opium cans as evidence a
hum of conversation from the veranda of
the small building reached the ears of the
men in the colonels office and two or three
times the c o glanced up irritably as
soon as harrow had finished he rung a bell
and captain peele his adjutant entered

  tell that bunch of-gossips on the

porch to get to -- away from here he
ordered headquarters is no officers club
on this field

  the captain departed and the colonel
looked speculatively at tex and hickman

  you flew with the english during the
war didnt you he inquired suddenly

  from  on sir replied the flyer

  got three boche somebody told me
am i right

   yes sir

  hum well what have you and your
movie partner got to say about this opium
deal it would have been bad enough if it
had been only whisky did you people at
mcmullen get the orders from colonel feld-
more about carrying liquor

  yes sir stated hickman and
neither macdowell or i know any more
about how that opium got in our ship than
you do

  there was no mistaking the sincerity of
the big observers vigorous statement
major schaffer got the colonels eye

  will the colonel give me permission to
say a word he asked

  go ahead i was wondering what in

-you were horning in on this deal for

anyway commented the colonel dryly

  the major smiled

  here is what i wanted to say sir in
a nutshell you may or may not know that
lieutenant macdowell here has twice come

up against dave fitzpatrick anyhow you
know fitzpatrick for the most powerful
unscrupulous man in the southwest am
i right

  the colonel nodded

  well for reasons dating from years
back this uncrowned king of the border is
out to get macdowell captain kennard
a very close friend of mine has told me the
whole story what i was going to suggest
sir was that captain kennard be brought
to donovan field to present the case-

i am sure it would carry more weight
than if tex-i should say lieutenant mac-
dowell-told it himself personally i have
known these men some time and through
their c o i know them very well i believe
they are innocent with captain kennard
to give all the dope about how fitzpatrick
has tried to frame macdowell before i
believe that we can convince you or a court
martial of their innocence

  the colonel smoked contemplatively for
a moment and then made his decision

  this case is open and shut if for no
other reason than the complaints which
have come to us from san antonio-rather
mysterious the way they suddenly started
too-we must take every step to apprehend
and severely punish any lawbreaker in the
service nevertheless i know fitzpatrick

and i know good men-

  he broke off for a moment his thoughts
evidently far away he threw away his
cigaret impatiently

  my mind is open on the subject ill
have captain kennard wired to fly up here
this afternoon unless the matter is satis-
factorily cleared up of course a general
court martial is inevitable as matters
stand now you must be tried you men
will consider yourselves under arrest you
will report to me at ten oclock tomorrow
morning in this office harrow fix up
quarters for them and notify the provost
marshal thats all

ill

 j that evening obeying an order
from colonel mills through one of
his orderlies tex and hickman
reported to headquarters they found
there the colonel himself and captain
kennard who had flown in from mcmullen
during the afternoon with them was
colonel feldmore department air service
feuds end

officer he was a tall spare man of middle
age with a rough-hewn face and a wide
reputation throughout the army he was
known as one of the fairest men in the
army-but a bad hombre if somebody ran
foul of him and he never set out to accom-
plish the complete and lasting subjugation
of a man unless he had good reason for so
doing he knew his own mind and changed
it for neither man nor devil

  the two flyers saluted their three su-
periors and waited silently both were
now in full uniform from stock to boots
underlining the double-wing on mac-
dowells blouse was a row of ribbons-the
croix de guerre with three palms the
ribbon with a rosette representing the
legion of honor and the british d s o

  sit down gentlemen we have called
you here for a complete discussion of the
incident of this morning

  colonel mills stopped a moment as the
noise of an automobile motor stopping in
front of headquarters reached his ears

  it is rapidly growing in importance
the newspapers tonight are full of it it is
something which for the good of the service
-and i hope for your own good as well-
must be plumbed to the bottom quickly
you realize of course what a blot on the
service it has become already

  heavy steps sounded in the hall

  no never mind son ill just mosey
right in somebody said to the orderly
outside and then the door was thrown open
unceremoniously

  tex leaped to his feet as if he had been
shot

  dad how in the world-

  the gray-bearded giant in the doorway
grasped his sons hand and pumped it en-
thusiastically

  just dropped in for a social call he
replied with a rumbling laugh

  his twinkling blue eyes set in a face the
color of mahogany looked the flyer up and
down affectionately the other four men
were on their feet for some reason none
of them except hickman appeared greatly
surprized

  now what in-have you been up to

you limb of the devil asked mr mac-
dowell still holding his stalwart sons hand

  tex was big but his father dwarfed him
he was six feet four as he stood and must
have weighed two hundred and fifty pounds
without being fat his huge black som-

brero was pushed back on his head his
gray suit soft white shirt and black tie
were all of conventional cut although a
discerning eye might have noted that the
shirt was silk and that the suit could not
have been purchased for a cent less than a
hundred dollars

  limb of the devil inquired tex with
a grin ive heard other people call

  dont get disrespectful warned the
old ranchman with his rumbling laugh
what these here generals could do to you
wouldnt be a patch on what your old
daddy would accomplish when he got
started

  excuse me colonel feldmore colonel
mills captain kennard and george hick-
man-my father

  mr macdowell shook hands with them
all when he got to hickman he stopped
for a moment twisting his plentiful gray
mustache while he took a good look at the
observer

  boy ill swear i get weak-like every
time i remember seein those movies o you

climbing around one of these-- airplanes

i dont know what this mess o lees is that
the captain wired about but are you in it

  george grinned

  up to the neck sir he admitted rue-
fully

  tex glanced at the captain quickly so
he had got in touch with macdowell senior
had he

  well lets hear the lay demanded the
old man finally easing himself into the
biggest chair in the office

  in concise sentences colonel mills told
of what happened that morning while
he was speaking macdowell senior drew
a package of brown cigaret papers from
a capacious pocket filled one of them with
tobacco and rolled it in the twinkle of an
eye he lit it deliberately it was almost
ludicrous to see so huge a man with so di-
minutive a smoke tucked underneath the
flowing gray mustache

  i sent for you for a reason that i will
explain in a moment said captain ken-
nard when the colonel had finished i
didnt tell tex because i was afraid hed
object i did it on my own responsibility
because ive heard a lot about roaring
bill macdowell and i knew you could help
us clear your son

  mr macdowell removed the sombrero


adventure

thoughtfully and placed it on the floor
his thick iron gray hair stood up in terrify-
ing disorder after he had run his fingers
through it a few times holding the stub
of his cigaret between his fingers he turned
and looked at tex who was sitting beside
him

how about it son he asked quietly

tex his expression thoroughly serious
for once met his fathers eyes squarely

  i saw that stuff for the first time out
here on the field dad he replied

  of course just asked you to have it on
record

  he lifted himself to his feet the other
men watching him closely

  gentlemen the idea of lees doing that
is ridiculous on the face of it i am not in
the habit o bragging about how much im
worth but i rise to remark that i can sign
a check for a lot of money and every nickel
of it is this boys whenever he wants it he
has always had all the money he wanted and

could have had a - sight more if he

hadnt been too independent to take it
taking all personal considerations out of it

why in-would he bother around with

a couple of hundred dollars worth of
opium

  the old man looked around the circle
belligerently colonel feldmore smoking
quietly with his chair tipped back against
the wall smiled to himself he had heard
much of roaring bill macdowell

  now george hickman-

  the same thing goes for him stated
tex quickly weve turned down movie
contracts as high as a thousand a week
and george of course would have got most
of it

  captain kennard nodded he had seen
the letters

  it being settled in our own minds that
these boys not being complete and total
idiots wouldnt mess around and smuggle
opium for what few dollars they could
get-

  roaring bill interrupted himself suddenly
and looked at the two colonels question-
ingly

  or maybe you dont agree speak up
colonel what do you think

  tex was on his feet the old half-humor-
ous half-mocking twist at the corners of
his mouth

  dad youre a - good rancher and

cattleman but you dont know the army

if we have the colonels permission hick-
man and i will go

  very well assented colonel mills
stay in your quarters for a while so that
we can get you by telephone if we need
you

ifjss the two flyers saluted and went
mul out- m macdowell watched them
his eyes twinkling colonel feld-
more nodded slightly as if in approval at
the tact displayed by tex in withdrawing

  now gentlemen what is your open
opinion about this deal

  the ranchman was not to be dissuaded
from the point at issue for even a moment
for the first time colonel feldmore joined
the conversation

  it is the opinion of both mills and my-
self that the boys are innocent in fact
we have stronger reasons for believing so
than you will have until you hear what
captain kennard has got to say unless
your son has written you regarding his
dealings with dave fitzpatrick

  mammy hannah has that son-of-a-
gun of a boy o mine been mixed up with
dave fitzpatrick roared the old man in
a surprized bellow

  he sure has stated the captain

and-

  excuse me captain before we tell
you mr macdowell the very peculiar
status of affairs i want to have you thor-
oughly understand this no matter how
firmly we as men or army officers believe
in the innocence of those two fellows we
can not fail to press the charges unless they
are quashed by incontrovertible evidence
we can not simply say they are innocent-
that they have been framed by a powerful
enemy the army men may have been
lax about liquor civilians in san antonio
-a few of them-have raised a howl a
couple of ministers have mentioned it
vaguely from the pulpit the evening
post in its report of our last dance gross-
ly exaggerated the illumination of the par-
ticipants for humorous purposes to make
things worse a complaint to the com-
manding general of the department was
made and strict orders issued finally
through some pressure the department of
justice horned in to help us out they
were on hand this morning when the ship
from mcmnllen came in

  if that skunk dave fitzpatrick is after
feuds end



lee hes got the power to start wheels
turning in san antone declared the ranch-
man the wrinkles between his eyes deepen-
ing until the bushy white eyebrows almost
met over his prominent nose probably
that bird snow was in the plot hed bear
investigating

  i dont doubt that but you see where
we stand weve got to put up or shut up
said colonel mills taking up the thread of
his chiefs remarks unless we can prove
the innocence of the two lieutenants its
bound to be a nasty mess

  youre right colonel now lets get
the lay on this fitzpatrick stuff twenty
years ago gentlemen when that cold
brainy crooked -- was a cattleman i
caught him cheating in a stud-poker game
at palestine texas and drove him out of
the country since then hes become rich
i know by every means known to man or
devil ive kind of lost track of his opera-
tions but i know for a fact that he pulls
wires down in that little mexican joint he
hangs out at that make at least one weak-
backed jelly-hearted water-blooded nin-
compoop in washington jump now what
about him and the boy

  well mr macdowell began the cap-
tain its really a case of the deeds of the
father being visited on the children accord-
ing to the dope old-timers like sheriff bill
trowbridge down at mcmullen and ayres of
the texas rangers gave me one time when
tex was bound for el paso on a flying trip
ayres met him and gave him the news that
fitzpatrick was out to get him just what
channels the news got to ayres through
i dont know when ayres found out that
tex was the son of roaring bill mac-
dowell he figured right away that fitz-
patrick wanted to get back at the man who
had been the means of his own disgrace by
trying to run his son out of the country
under a cloud

  his actions have borne this out he
could have had tex killed a hundred times
of course by one of his gunmen but there
is nothing he has against tex himself-
there can be nothing he tried one of his
usual methods on him in el paso-what he
has done before to men whom he wanted to
ruin three of his men-a mexican and

two others named searles and beers-

  searles eh interrupted macdowell

a-good man gone wrong let me tell

you

  well they got tex into a poker game
tex through ayres warning suspected the
lay but that infernal disposition of his to
pit himself deliberately against heavy odds
for the pure joy of taking a chance made
him consent to play he was watching
closely for crooked work and caught
a switch in the decks he got four aces
pat and figured that one of the others
would have a straight flush to beat him
everybody dropped out but him and beers
beers urged him to put in a couple of thou-
sand dollars worth of i o us so that he
could demand payment at once and prose-
cute when they werent paid i suppose
well tex took a chance that beers straight
flush would not be pat-he figured that would
be too raw-stayed in the pot and finally
threw away one of his four aces and drew
two cards thus spoiling beers draw if he
had an open end straight-flush which the
two top cards on the deck would fill-
either one of them i mean you see no
one would figure tex to do anything but
draw one or stand pat

  a roar of laughter burst from the old
ranchman

  did lee do that how much did he
win

  around twenty-five hundred i think
grinned captain kennard ransom one
of my observers was there and helped tex
gather up the money at the point of a gun
before the three crooks could squeal you
see what fitzpatrick was probably figur-
ing-to get tex into debt demand full pay-
ment and perhaps through holding a club
over his head drive him into doing some-
thing through which fitzpatrick could drive
him out of the border country and out of the
army in disgrace sort of crooked justice
for what you did to him mr macdowell

  dave sure got it plenty up around
palestine agreed macdowell great
jemimah but ill bet that two thousand
hurt the old snake worse than taking his
right eye longs he knew who the boy was

  the old man was still smiling delightedly
as he digested the full perfection of his sons
achievement  he looked at colonel feld-
more with twinkling eyes

  i taught that young sprig to play the
great game of draw poker when he was eight

years old colonel but-if i dont believe

the child is father to the man

  apparently hes no sucker at the game
laughed the colonel
h

adventure

  not by a long shot-never was de-
clared the ranchman he raised a lot of

- when he was around the ranch but

i couldnt very well object havin been
somewhat of a poor church-member myself
when young i reckon it taught him some-
thing-nothing like experience

  he rolled another brown paper smoke
and his seamed and lined face gradually
became serious

  what youve told me captain is news
to me he resumed at length speaking
slowly as if carefully considering his words
and in spite of the boy havin come out on
the big end of the horn once or twice its

a - serious thing for any man to have

dave fitzpatrick out to get him

  the three army men nodded agreement
it was easy for fitzpatrick to work this
deal too said captain kennard by
getting acquainted with some enlisted man
his own employee could easily find out stuff
and slip in the hangar at night to plant the
opium

  mr macdowell nodded

i just what has happened probably of
course everybody thats been around texas
much knows that hes in cahoots with every
bandit from villa to rentaria and that hes
got a gang of outlaws of every breed workin
for him up and down the border on his
smuggling deals but id give a pretty penny
to know how many prominent judges
bankers and government men are under his
thumb

  the old texans eyes were on the glow-
ing tip of his cigaret and there was a remi-
niscent gleam in them as he continued

  it worries me about the boy because if
theres any man in the world fitzpatrick
has reason to hate its me gentlemen
and if hes planning to get back at me
through lee its time for the old man to
get busy pronto theres nothing too low
and sneaking for fitzpatrick and likewise
nothing too bold or bloody-

  i personally knew three men--two
army officers and a customs man-who got
something on fitzpatrick and bucked him
they didnt get anywhere and furthermore
they all left the country in disgrace
colonel feldmore nodded agreement with
mills words

  mr macdowell got to his feet as if he
had come to a decision

  im getting to work tomorrow to try and
clear this opium deal up not only that

but to clean fitzpatrick up hes been
allowed to get away too long as it is funny
thing how those thingsll happen-a city
will sit back and let a gang of crooks run it
for years and never get up gumption enough
to throw em out makes me laugh to have
new york and those towns laugh at texas
difference in circumstances thats all ive
got a little influence around this part of the
country and im starting to use it a hun-
dred of fitzpatricks men have been caught
but never a time has the old rattlesnake
himself been burnt now gentlemen how
long are you going to give me to work on
this before the boy is court martialed

- i wish hed a told me about this

before

  thats the trouble with him opined
captain kennard why mr macdowell
that young fool actually enjoys being in
a mess if theres anything in the world
hell go miles to live through its a scrap of
any kind hes-

  chip off the old block laughed his
father never got out o hot water myself
till i got married theres nothing better
than a good scrap but when the boy goes
up against dave fitzpatrick its a cold deck
right from the go

  i know it and ive got something to
suggest said the captain tex is our
engineer officer down at mcmullen and it
would be a good thing for him to take the
course at the mechanics school anyway
inasmuch as this happening today shows
clearly that fitzpatrick is in deadly earnest
about framing tex why wouldnt it be
a good thing to order him up here colonel
for that course while he is awaiting trial
it would appear better in san antonio too
to have him right on the ground up here
inasmuch as i think we all believe that it
was fitzpatrick who planted the whole
deal its a dead cinch that hell find ways to
stimulate a continuous and loud bunch of
protests if it appears that the case isnt
being pressed tex will be away from the
border where fitzpatricks power is most
absolute and where he would have every
opportunity to plunge him still further into
trouble and his father here can start the
wheels turning with a free mind the idea

wont appeal to tex but- it colonel

i think the world of that fellow and i know

- well that fitzpatrickll get him just

as sure as-unless we forget were army

officers and look at it like men
feuds end



  the captains plea was vehement and
sincere and both the other officers knew the
truth of his words before they left the
office that night it had been decided that
tex and george hickman were to remain
at donovan field under orders and that
the time of their trial would be delayed as
long as possible to give mr macdowell
a chance to use his wide power and influence
to start things in motion to clear them from
the charges

  understand mr macdowell were
colonel mills parting words to the texan
as men we are behind you in what you
believe as army officers unless proof can
be obtained to present to the court martial
we must press those charges and there isnt
a chance in the world of the two boys
escaping im afraid unless we can find
something that will convince others of what
we are already convinced of if they got
by the army court martial you know that
a civilian jury will be waiting for them

  i understand perfectly colonel stated
macdowell senior leave things to me
ill trim fitzpatrick again like i did twenty
years ago or my name isnt macdowell
now lets forgetjt listen

  with exaggerated care he tiptoed from
one to the other whispering a few words in
each mans ear broad smiles spread over
the faces of the three as they listened

  twenty-year-old stuff gentlemen he
said aloud so shall we take colonel mills
suggestion here and adjourn to his quarters
ive still got that car out here-its in a bag
j crave to moisten up

 iv

it was two weeks later when tex
working busily in grimy overalls
was told that major stratton com-
manding officer of the mechanics school
wanted to see him immediately carruthers
officer in charge of the course for engineer
officers brought tex the message mac-
dowell was hard at work putting together
the internal workings of a torn-down liberty
motor the mechanics school believed
that for every lecture on the theory of
motors there should be many hours devoted
to getting the hands dirty and learning by
actual experience

  good lord carruthers have i got to
mosey down and clean up right now in-
quired tex disgustedly

  unless you want to interview the major
in that spiffy suit of coveralls replied
carruthers who was a slight good-looking
fellow with a pair of sparkling brown eyes
and a flashing smile that helped to make him
one of the most popular men on the field

  he had been a senior in a prominent
engineering school at the start of the war
and incidentally held one or two new
england intercollegiate records on the
track

  they may not be the glass of fashion
agreed tex carefully wiping and then wrap-
ping up his tools but theyre cool

  i dont see why theyre so stiff wilh
dirt you might as well be wearing a tin
suit retorted carruthers ive got to re-
port along with you by the way

  its no hardship for you fashion plates
in boots and breeches now we who labor

with our hands-

  shut up and lets get started ill take
you down to the quarters on the motorcycle
so you can change

  tex locked up his tools in a chest and
then with carruthers at his side walked
down the long hangar where dozens of
students-commissioned and enlisted-were
working busily under the guidance of in-
structors two lecture rooms at the far
end were filled to overflowing with classes
which were getting lecture periods the
mechanics school was the mechanic-factory
of the air service and major stratton saw
to it that production was fast and thorough

  carruthers started the motorcycle and
tex folded up his long legs and eased him-
self into the sidecar he showed no effects in
his manner or face of the difficult two weeks
that had passed since the discovery of
opium in his ship being under confine-
ment he had not been off the field during
that time but for days the newspapers of
san antonio had played up the story with
vague hints of a huge smuggling conspiracy
which was using army airplanes to trans-
port the contraband goods the name mac-
dowell hitherto prominent as the hero of
many flying exploits was spread across
newspaper pages during those days as the
first of many important criminals who
would be taught a lesson

  in the mechanics school itself after the
first day or two tex had effortlessly estab-
lished himself as a real guy his whimsi-
cal humor lack of conceit and above all his
refusal  allow the fact that he was in
i

adventure

confinement for an important crime to
affect either his sense of humor or his at-
titude toward his work speedily convinced
the busy young officers of the school that
regardless of the fact that he might be guilty
he was an addition to the gang he won
their money at poker flew their scout ships
as they had seldom been flown before and
refused absolutely to discuss the charges
against him in any way futhermore no
amount of pumping could persuade him to
launch forth into tales of his achievements
overseas or on the border as a result the
attitude of the schools young men was
expressed by slim evans a few days after
they had all come to know the man of whom
they had heard so much

  he may be guilty or he may not
stated slim around the mess-table one
night when tex was absent and personally

i	dont give a-whether he is or not

  which attitude tex must have noticed
but if he did he gave no indication that he
realized his peculiar position among his
brother officers right now he was wonder-
ing whether the wheels were beginning to
move had macdowell senior accom-
plished anything carruthers being asked
to report likewise however made it rather
improbable that the major wanted to talk
about the opium business

  carruthers sat and smoked while tex
quickly bathed and dressed the young
engineer only a fair pilot himself through
lack of opportunity to make flying his chief
business in the army was secretly a pro-
found admirer of the seasoned veteran who
was one of his motor students being of a
sensitive disposition he realized better than
most of the others just how much poise and
cold nerve it took for the texan to conduct
himself naturally and carve a niche for
himself in the mechanics school under the
circumstances jack carruthers was for
tex hook line and sinker and as they sped
toward headquarters for the interview with
the major he was almost hoping that it
would be of such a nature as would give him
an opportunity to demonstrate his loyalty

  both men waited with interest for the
major to bring up the subject of the inter-
view for a moment however he insisted
on discussing with tex the advantages of a
sideslip landing he had seen him make
a beauty that morning and unlike most
high-ranking officers the major was a real
flyer himself which meant that he was ready

to discuss flying at all times when a kindred
soul was around to discuss it with him

  finally he came to the reason for asking
the two men to report

  captain barrett from washington took
a ship from here to fly to the corbett ranch
two days ago he said we sent old ser-
geant correll along with him well the
captain got lost in a fog and landed near a
town called ausman texas down on the
gulf of mexico it was muddy and he
turned over on his back broke the prop
a wheel jimmed up the rudder and various
other minor injuries the captain had to
get back to washington so he left correll
with the plane

  weve got to send down a ship with the
needed supplies and two pilots one to fly
each ship back our officers are pretty
busy so i figured it would help us out if we
could pull you out of school for a week--
you would just drop down a class you see-
and send you as one of the pilots mac-
dowell

  id sure like to go major but being a
criminal- drawled tex with a rising in-
flection at the end

  the young major grinned

  i know colonel mills was a little afraid
of doing it but colonel feldmore said he
was getting fed up on all the lambasting
san antonio was giving the air service in
general and you in particular and that i
could send you and be - to what any-
body thought however we are going to
make a concession to public opinion and
appoint the other pilot-carruthers if he
wants to go-technically your guard while
youre away

  tex shook his head doubtfully

  hes so little major my- think

what a temptation id be under to escape

  get tough with me and ill show you
threatened carruthers id sure like to
go sir he added to the major

  i thought you would-your job doesnt
give you much chance for cross-country
work and in addition your knowledge of
motors may help correll in fixing up the
ship its been out there in the mud too
long to be in good shape

  he reached over his desk and handed
tex a slip of paper

  here are all the directions for finding
the field which correll has picked out as
suitable for you to land on its practically
next to the place where the captain cracked
feuds end



up and about a mile out of town ausman
isnt on most maps-its just a little place
i guess but a branch line of the railroad that
goes through barnes city has just recently
been put through according to correll
you can follow that railroad to acacia and
from there the branch line to ausman
which isnt on our maps its right on the
gulf

  when do you wish us to start sir
asked tex folding up the paper and putting
it in his pocket

  tomorrow morning johnson will give
you a ship better take a jenny with an
h motor-no use of taking chances with one
of these overbalanced dhs on a short trip
you can land at the government field at
barnes city for gas

  the young major watched the two flyers
go out with a satisfied smile he wondered
whether tex suspected that his c o had
deliberately pulled wires to give him the
trip mrs stratton was a texas girl and
familiar with what the name macdowell
had meant in texas since old roaring bill
had first become a cattleman back in the
eighties not that mrs stratton could re-
member the eighties but her father had
many a tale to tell of the old days when he
and macdowell senior and a few other
hardy souls had fought their way by main
strength to a commanding position in the
lone star state

  the major himself was not in charge of
the most important single activity of the
air service for nothing-he knew men and
he agreed thoroughly with his wife that in
all probability tex was a most unfortunate
victim of circumstances the c o turned
back to his work in a righteous glow-that
assignment would mean something to mac-
dowell in more ways than one

  it did and in more ways than even the
major could possibly have in mind

v

their sturdy training-plane was
well loaded down next morning
when macdowell and carruthers
took off a propeller was wired to one wing
next to the fuselage a spare wheel took up
most of the available space in the under-
carriage tied between struts a rudder was
tied securely to the other wing in such a
manner that it did not rest on its base and

twist out of shape a suitcase holding the

  

toilet kits and a change of linen for the two
flyers was strapped next to the rudder in
the back cockpit a tool kit extra spark
plugs new distributor brushes and other
small easily broken and vitally important
parts of an aviation motor were stuffed
beneath the seat

  it was a gray cloudy day although it was
not cold and the clouds were high the
wind was blowing southeast from the gulf
which meant that the hundred-and-seventy
mile trip would be made in slow time

  as always when he was flying anything
but the heavy overpowered unbalanced
dehaviland tex felt carefree the de-
haviland is so infinitely more difficult to
land safely in the event of a forced landing
due to its weight and high landing speed
plus the fact that its undercarriage is set
too far back and the plane will nose up at
the slightest provocation that almost any
other ship seems like pie to a pilot ac-
customed to dehavilands

  his map was fastened in front of him
tacked down on a mapboard at two thou-
sand feet he picked up the railroad to barnes
city throttled his hundred-and-eighty
horsepower motor to  rpm and flew
southeast there were plenty of large fields
if the motor went bad although water was
discernible in many of them it had rained
the night before

  barnes city where they were to make the
first stop was the eighth town down the
railroad marked by a reservoir the field
maintained by the government as a landing-
place for cadets on their practice cross-
country flights was next to the reservoir

  they picked up the field without trouble
and tex spiraled down slowly while he gave
the landing-ground a careful scrutiny
there was a pool of water at one end but
otherwise it looked fairly hard the ap-
proach for a landing into the wind was
directly over the town at a thousand feet
over the town he cut the throttle to idling
and cocked up the jenny until it was in an
almost vertical bank top rudder started
it to slipping down with very little forward
speed he leveled out at a hundred feet
and glided slowly dropping over the trees
at the edge of the field and stalling down -
to the ground a slow landing is good
policy in any strange field-a small bump
or a very shallow ditch may wreck a fast-
landing ship townspeople could be seen
standing in the middle of the streets
i

adventure

watching the sight that never seems to lose
novelty-an airplane in flight

  the field was short the way they landed-
less than a hundred and fifty yards but the
slow landing caused them to stop rolling
with half the space unused tex taxied to
the edge of the road which ran by the field
and had just cut his motor when the gas
truck from a garage which supplied govern-
ment ships with high-test gas came bouncing
along the rough highway it was a matter
of only a few minutes to refill the half-
empty gas and oil tanks make out the
necessary vouchers and get the ship cranked
for the warm-up

  carruthers placed a couple of sizeable
rocks under the wheels for blocks and then
sat on the tail while macdowell warmed the
motor at about eight hundred revs it
missed and backfired a few times but quick-
ly caught again and ran smoothly when he
finally opened the throttle wide for a few
seconds tex turned to carruthers and
nodded the motor man crawled beneath
the wings picked out the stones and then
climbed to his seat and strapped himself in

  tex gave it the gun slowly he was tak-
ing off toward the reservoir-it would be
a cross-wind take-off but it gave him the
long way of the field and a jenny is slow
getting off the ground for a moment the
motor missed and then caught ag in
smoothly the ship left the ground and
was twenty-five feet high as it reached the
edge of the two-hundred-yard square reser-
voir tex threw it into a left-hand bank
for a turn back toward the field without
any warning one bank of cylinders cut com-
pletely out and there was a loud report as
the motor backfired

  the reservoir was surrounded by trees
and shrubbery there was but one opening
scarcely twenty-five feet wide directly in
front of them like a flash tex nosed down
his ship and dived for the opening there
was no hope of getting over the tops of the
trees carruthers in the back seat pushed
up his goggles and protected his face with
his arm preparing for the inevitable crash
their wing spread was forty-seven feet-
the opening little more than half that much

  tex dived steeply for speed-he was
skimming the water twenty yards away
from the aperture in the trees one bank
of cylinders lent them a little aid as he
sped closer to his goal he took the desperate
chance that he had decided  an instant

after the motors failure he banked steep-
ly his ship so close to the ground that the
lower wing tip was barely a foot above the
earth the tiniest slip-which seemed in-
evitable as the ship lost speed-would cause
the wing to catch the ground

  the banked ship curved through the
narrow opening and with all the flying
sense the years had given him tex fought to
keep it in the air they were scarcely
through the screen of bushes when he
jammed the stick over the other way to
bring it back to level he was just too late
-the right wheel hit the ground first and
they bounced eight feet cocked up to the
right and amost stalled in the air

  with the instinct of a born flyer however
tex anticipated the action of the ship and
had pushed the stick forward almost jjefore
the bounce occurred he caught the ship
in time and it landed correctly instead of
nose-diving the eight feet which it would
have done had there been a split seconds
delay in nosing down when the ship bounced
had it reached the height of the bounce be-
fore the action of the controls caught it fly-
ing speed would have been completely gone

the whole maneuver had taken
about five seconds and had been a
series of instantaneous decisions any
one of which meant the difference between
a wreck and possible safety the ship
stopped rolling a few feet from an irrigation
ditch one of several that cut the field the
wheels were an inch deep in the soft ground
-had the ground not been so saturated
with moisture they would have rolled into
the ditch and all macdowelps efforts gone
for naught

  tex pushed up his goggles and turned
to look at carruthers

  so this is paris he observed

  carruthers drew a deep breath

  excuse me if i seem to act peculiar
he replied with a deep breath but i was
shaking hands with st peter and just let
go

  as they climbed out of the ship a man
came running toward them leading a group
of men women and children from near-by
houses who had heard the motor go bad

   cant take off in this field if we can fix
the ship said tex disgustedly got to

drag the - thing back to the regular

field someway i wonder what in-got

into the thing
feuds end



  a carburetor jet completely plugged i
think replied the motor expert opening
the door at the side of the motor cowling

  i hope thats all say that reservoir
looks about as small as a pond now but it
sure made the pacific ocean look like a dew-
drop when that bank cut didnt it
drawled tex manufacturing the inevitable
cigaret as he watched the breathless ap-
proach of a rapidly growing crowd of curious
bystanders

  when they arrived carruthers was busy
with a jet wrench removing the high-speed
jet from the carburetor which fed the de-
linquent bank of cylinders while tex
conversed with the gathering his comrade
got out the jet and discovered a piece of
rubber tubing which had been sucked from
one of the hose connections in the gasline
and had tightly plugged the tiny jet it
was removed easily by means of a piece
of wire in twenty minutes the restarted
motor ran perfectly

  tex cut the switches and climbed out
now how are we going to get this ship
around the reservoir to where we can take
off he inquired of all and sundry i
wonder what the chances of hiring about
four good mules are

  a big sunburnt man in overalls and a
mexican straw sombrero expectorated a
young cloudburst of tobacco juice before
replying

im shy  mules right now but i own
this field and ive got a tractor that might do
the job we got to cross a brook though
fine chorused the flyers a tractor
would simplify things immensely

  we sure will appreciate your helping
us tex told their benefactor heartily

  its all right-had a boy was a mechanic
in the flying corps returned the farmer
from what he told me and what ive seen
right around this field you flyersve got
enough to tend to in the air without haulin
ships around on the ground

  soon the tractor came rolling along over
the field and the tail of the ship was hoisted
and tied to it it was not all easy sailing
however-two of the impromptu bridges
that the flyers aided by kind-hearted on-
lookers built across the brook running into
the reservoir promptly broke it was after
one oclock when the ship was finally resting
on the field and the flyers gratefully ac-
cepted the invitation of mr cole their
chief helper to have dinner with him

  during the course of the hearty meal that
stout motherly mrs cole served them her
husband inquired-

  goin back to san antone now

  no were trying hard to get to the city
of ausman texas returned tex who was
stowing away hot biscuits with much gusto

  ausman eh that sure is a right funny
town observed their host ever been
there

  no-a fellow cracked up down there
and were after his ship carruthers told
him

  somebody had a narrow escape from
coming after us stated tex leaning back
with a satisfied sigh i wouldnt mind
working like i did this morning as a steady
diet if there were meals like this around
mrs cole beamed with pride at the com-
pliment to her cooking

  whats the matter with ausman in-
quired carruthers offering cole a cigaret
which was rejected in favor of a huge corn-
cob pipe

  nothing special just looks and seems
funny i was in there once trying to buy
some cottonseed i heard a fellow down there
had and everybody down there seemed to
be figurin what i was doin around the
town made me feel like everybody was
lookin at me crossways drummers cornin
through here said they never had sold any-
thing to the big store down there-some-
times a new man goes over from acacia
but he soon gets cured i never felt so
much like id butted in on a party where i
wasnt invited in my life

  well with a little luck i guess well
get in and out fast stated macdowell
rising from the table

  maybe you wont want to laughed
cole refilling his big pipe i was only
there a few hours but i smelt a lot of
breaths and they was sure strong enough
so you could hang your hat on em hooch
flows free in that town or im a liar

  the two flyers made their adieu and de-
parted after thanking mr and mrs cole
profusely for their kindness as they
walked the few hundred yards to the field
carruthers remarked

  sounds like ausman might be a little
more interesting than the average texas
town if it is itll be the first good town i
ever got into via the air every time i get
stranded i find its one of those movies-
once-a-week places


adventure

  if the demon rum is prominent there

youre going to have a-- of a job to hold

your prisoner returned tex

  go ahead if you havent learned not
to fool with contraband goods by this time
youre a hardened criminal and beyond
redemption

  it was the first time macdowells status
had been alluded to even in joking vein
although neither man betrayed his feelings
the facetious conversation had a sobering
effect during those last two weeks tex
almost without realizing it had been gradu-
ally changing his attitude all his life he
had met-even courted-danger a contest

of any kind with a queer kind of delight
that was a part of him

  he had deliberately walked into fitz-
patricks net at el paso for the pure joy of
pitting himself against a powerful enemy
and outwitting him once again when
fitzpatrick had nearly succeeded in robbing
him of an invention which he and sergeant
cary of mcmullen had developed he had
outwitted his powerful enemy

  now as they silently approached the
ship he had commenced to realize some-
thing of the relentless enmity the cold
implacable purpose of the man who was
the most feared influence on the border
carruthers light words had brought home

to him once more the fact which no one
realized better than himself-that one lee
macdowell was under the shadow of a
menacing cloud that bid fair to engulf him

  unless his powerful father could succeed
in running to earth proof enough to show
beyond question of a doubt that the ap-
parently open-and-shut evidence of the
opium-laden ship was the work of dave
fitzpatrick his army career was done and
there might be a couple of years in leaven-
worth

  it was incongruous that full realization
of what he had to fight should come to him
right then he reflected but as he climbed

in the cockpit and switched on the ignition
to start the motor he failed to under-
estimate the odds against him for the first
time in his life

  which was something that would have
caused great satisfaction to captain ken
nard back at mcmullen who knew mac-
dowell better than the reckless young texan
knew himself

vi

ten minutes of flying proved that
the motor was in excellent condition
once more so tex decided to lop
off a few miles of the trip by flying a
straight airline leaving the railroad it went
feuds end



straight east for forty miles and then bent
sharply southward to acacia ausman was
southeast of acacia the map showed a
small river which would serve as a landmark
on a straight course for their destination

  it was a deserted strip of country that
fifty miles one tiny group of buildings
probably belonging to a ranchman was the
only evidence of human habitation that the
two airmen could discern at intervals
herds of cattle could be seen standing out
sharply in the clear air even from five
thousand feet

  finally the river bent northward and
there was no landmark to guide them tex
flew due southeast by his compass as the
flying-time from barnes city grew to fifty
minutes and then an hour tex scanned the
country ahead anxiously the railroad
running south of ausman should be in sight
by then-the gulf itself only a few miles
farther on

  a white streak ahead became visible it
was a highway running almost north and
south the pilot studied his map carefully
it was evidently the highway which ap-
proached ausman from the south he had
drifted too far to the south while flying
without landmarks on the ground to guide
him perhaps the prevailing wind at five
thousand feet had been from the north and
blown them off course at any rate they
could not be far from their goal ten miles
further eastward the waters of the gulf
could be seen shimmering through the light
ground haze

  he banked around to follow the road
northward it was wide and looked as if
it was smooth and level it was probably
a boulevard used by the big summer colony
at corpus christi many miles south for
automobiling

  as he flew above the road he noticed two
automobiles coming from opposite direc-
tions the one going north toward ausman
was traveling very fast the other car
a much smaller one was proceeding slowly
both tex and carruthers watched the two
cars idly it was pleasant to have some
evidence of inhabited country after the long
jaunt over the trackless lonesome wastes
they had just traversed

  as the two cars approached each other
the fast-running one did not slow down
like two toys they sped toward each other
and the flyers watched helplessly as they
saw the smaller car skid topple and finally

turn over beside the road the big car had
collided with it

  tex cut the throttle half-way and dived
recklessly for the ground the wires
screamed with the speed but not until the
struts were shaking and the whole ship
vibrating wildly did tex pull up the nose
for a minute to reduce it then he cocked
up the ship in a vertical bank and with full
top rudder sent it into a wicked sideslip
that made them drop like a stone the side
wind blew his goggles around with its force
and he was compelled to hold them in place
with his hand

  in the back seat carruthers had his eyes
glued to the nasty looking wreck below
the big car had stopped and the figure of a
man could be seen approaching the mangled
little victim of his reckless driving there
was no sign of life from beneath the wreck-
age

  as they sped earthward tex looked
anxiously for a place to land the country
was swampy and isolated clumps of bushes
effectually spoiled any of the open places
for airplane-landing purposes the pilot
hoped that the big car was all right and
that he would not be forced to land for
prospects were very bad

  they were only fifteen hundred feet high
when he felt carruthers hand gripping his
shoulder he turned and carruthers point-
ed down excitedly

  a woman were the syllables his lips
formed and tex stuck his head far over
the side of the cockpit holding his goggles
to prevent their turning in the terrific air
blast generated by the dive

  sure enough the figure of a woman in
some sort of a white blouse was discernible
now and the man seemed to be simply
standing beside her certainly he was not
trying to help her

  it was a layout that demanded a little
investigation tex decided but where on
earth could he land with any chance of
safety there was not a possible place
unless-

  he scanned the road keenly there were
no wires or trees to hinder and it was
plenty wide enough the few bushes
seemed to be far enough back so that
wings would clear them instantly he de-
cided to risk it

  a half-mile back of the two cars he was
directly over the road a hundred feet high
he cut the throttle completely and glided


adventure

slowly the southeast wind started to
drift him a little so he nosed into it and
came down with his ship pointed slightly
diagonal to the wide straight highway one
comforting thing in his ticklish job was that
the ditches alongside the road were eight
feet from the edge of the road proper and
apparently very shallow

  carruthers despite his realization of the
difficulty of what tex was attempting felt
as safe as if he had been in church as he
afterward expressed it somehow or other
he had abounding confidence in the man
who was piloting him-more than he would
have had in himself which is the highest
compliment one pilot can pay another
probably fifty per cent of flyers refuse
absolutely to ride with anybody but them-
selves at the stick

  tex almost stalled his ship five feet from
the roadway as it dropped he kicked
the rudder so that the nose was pointed
directly down the road although they hit
hard it was on three points and they did
not bounce peering ahead with his head
over the side to give him better vision tex
worked his rudder desperately to keep the
ship going straight as it lost speed and the
controls began to become ineffective

  he was lucky-when the ship started
to come to a stop it did not take a notion
to deviate from its straight path had it
started to turn he would have been forced
to turn on the throttle to make the con-
trols effective and if they had not worked
immediately the extra speed would have
meant a crack-up in a ditch

  they had scarcely stopped rolling a few
hundred yards from the cars when car-
ruthers was out of the cockpit he grabbed
the left hand wing out at the end and
walked along as tex taxied slowly forward
by alternately pulling or pushing on his
wing carruthers helped keep the plane
rolling straight and in a moment they were
close by the heap of torn metal that rep-
resented the womans car

  tex left the motor idling and followed
carruthers at a run the man was now
kneeling alongside the woman who was
stretched partly beneath the wreckage he
swayed a little as he leaned over her his
back to the approaching airmen

  as they came up to him he turned and
looked up apparently he was either a
mexican or at least a half-breed he was
stout with a dark full face that was now

flushed with liquor it was a girl who was
stretched unconscious on the ground and
her shirtwaist and skirt were torn and dirty
not until they were right beside the drunk-
enly leering mexican did the two army men
see that one of his hands rested on a white
shoulder which was exposed by the torn
blouse

  carruthers grabbed the mexican by the
collar and jerked him to his feet he drew
back his foot and with all the strength he
had sent the mexican sprawling with a
well-placed kick tex bent over the girl
anxiously an ugly clot of blood on her
head might mean almost anything but the
limp unnaturally bent arm told its own
story it was broken

  he looked up in time to see the mexican
who was dressed flashily climb to his feet
his face was contorted with drunken rage
he started for carruthers tugging at a gun
in his hip pocket he did not notice tex
as the flyer leaped for him a crashing blow
behind the ear sent him to earth once more
and this time he lay still tex abstracted
his gun and rolled him to the side of the road
thanks tex said carruthers briefly
her arms broken and she may have
anything from a fractured skull to just a
bruise on her head stated tex as they
bent over the victim of the accident

  she was very young and more than
ordinarily good looking although now the
oval face was chalk-white beneath a tum-
bling mass of auburn hair that shone like
fire in the sunlight

  carruthers wet his handkerchief with
water from the ditch and carefully washed
away the blood from the girls head it
was starting to clot over an ugly gash just
over her left ear apparently however the
wound was not serious but the misshapen
arm was pitifully obvious

  i feel as helpless as a - baby

groaned carruthers how far are we from
ausman anyway

  about fifteen miles i think returned
tex weve got to get her back someway
if that spigs car is all right you can drive
her to ausman

  had we better try to bring her to

  i dont believe so that arm will prob-
ably give her- if she comes out of her

faint and we might as well let her alone
ill take a lcjok at the car

  carruthers who had the girls head in his
lap bandaged the cut on her head while
feuds end



tex started for the car he was doomed
to disappointment one wheel was crazily
askew and two blown tires showed that the
big machine must have skidded wildly after
hitting the other car

  nothing doing yelled tex as he came
back i wonder if anybody ever drives

along this-forsaken pike

  apparently not but weve got to do
something tex

  your words are as true as gospel me
lad but starting from there-what

  he looked at the girl speculatively and
then at the softly idling ship carruthers
caught his unspoken thought

  could we flv her in do you think

  i believe we could decided tex his-
eyes on the road that stretched away as
straight as a string for miles youd have
to hold her in though

 what about landing my- if any-
thing should happen-

  ive got full directions for the field and
old correll knows enough to pick a good one
it hasnt been raining here since yesterday
either probably hell be out to meet us in
a car and we can rush her to a doctor

  all righ -lets go

  carruthers ently eased himself away
from the girl and propped up her head on
a cushion which tex supplied they ran
for the ship and each took one side of the
tail they lifted it a few inches off the
ground and carefully swung it around care-
ful not to raise it too high for in that event
the revolving propeller would hit the ground
when it was pointed down the road they
came back to the girl

  what do you think about a sling for
that arm inquired tex i believe it
ought to be bound up too

  they finally took two pieces of board
and bound up her arm in a rough splint tex
ripped off his o d shirt and made a sling
out of it the girl stirred as they were
applying the rough surgery but apparently
did not regain consciousness

  they were preparing to carry her to the
ship when tex remarked-

  if were going to town it might be wise
to-er-cover up the young lady
carruthers grinned

  heres where i lose my shirt too i
guess he said as he took it off

  it was needed for there was very little
shirtwaist left and much creamy skin
exposed

  they slipped carruthers od shirt over
the girls head putting only her uninjured
arm through a sleeve they had just com-
pleted the operation when her eyelids flut-
tered and opened and a pair of big hazel
eyes looked up and met carruthers brown
ones with startled inquiry before she could
speak a spasm of pain twisted her features
oh-my arm she said faintly

  it got pretty badly hurt in that crash
replied carruthers settling her head more
comfortably on his shoulder dont try
to move it at all

  take care of her while i yank the stick
out of the back seat tex told him with
two of you in there that stick wouldnt
move a foot

  the girls eyes followed the tall flyer as
he strode rapidly toward the ship then
they returned to carruthers face

  you landed when you saw the wreck
she asked

  her face was very white but she gave no
other indication of pain

  you bet we did-and were going to
get you to a doctor by airplane too re-
joined the army man

  he smiled engagingly as he looked down
at the face that was turned upward to meet
his eyes she smiled back and then ap-
parently for the first time noticed her
peculiar wardrobe and the sleeveless shirt
worn by the man who was holding her
carruthers caught her puzzled questioning
look and rapidly sketched the events of
the past few moments for her he did not
tell her about the fracas with the mexican
he had-just finished as tex returned his
powerful shoulders and long sinewy arms
showing almost as brown as his face against
the white of his shirt

  were ready to ramble i guess he
stated how is the damsel in distress
fine thank you responded the girl
with a crooked little smile

  tex grinned appreciatively at the game-
ness displayed by the delicate-appearing
young woman

  you dont object to a ride in the plane
do you he asked as he and carruthers
lifted her gently to carry her to the ship
the quicker a doctor gets hold of you the
quicker that pain is going to stop

  i think it will almost be worth a broken
arm she told them as they slowly walked
toward the ship

  climb in jack and ill strap you said


adventure

tex and held the girl in his arms as car-
ruthers loosened his hold and quickly
climbed in

  as soon as he was strapped securely tex
lifted his burden over the side of the cock-
pit and lowered her into jacks lap careful
as they were the girls face went white with
pain as macdowells arm stirred the sling
she leaned back lifelessly as tex tucked her
feet as far back as possible to avoid the
possibility of jamming the controls in the
rear cockpit carruthers had his hands
locked around her he himself held in secure-
ly by the strap

  tex climbed into the front cockpit and
strapped himself before starting he took
another brief look at the directions correll
had sent for the field it was marked by a
big barn on one side and the mechanic
would have a t contructed in the best part
of the held the wrecked ship would be in
an adjoining field

  he slowly turned on the throttle the
take-off presented much less difficulty than
the landing on the road because the ship
would be going at top speed and even on
the ground would readily answer the con-
trols it was comparatively easy for him
to keep it straight down the road by gentle
use of the rudder although once he had to
swerve slightly to avoid hitting a bush with
his wing speed was picked up quickly on
the hard surface and they were safely off
the ground in a hundred yards

as they circled around toward
ausman tex glanced down and saw
the mexican walking slowly toward
his damaged automobile the pilot watched
his instruments with tense interest he
did not dare to let himself think of what a
forced landing would mean even the road
was not a possibility now for the shrub-
bery seemed to be closer and the ditches
deeper as they came in sight of a small
village that must be ausman

  they were fifteen hundred feet high and
as they came closer to town a big white t
loomed up plainly tex blessed the wise old
sergeant who knew that a t was the one
best bet in landmarks from the air the
barn was there too and in another field
the wrecked ship now right-side up could
be plainly seen several cars were standing
on the narrow little road that ran past the
field branching off from the main pike

  as he spiraled down with half-throttled

motor tex flew more carefully than he ever
had before striving to counteract the bumps
in the air so that the girl would be jarred
as little as possible in the back seat car-
ruthers holding his burden tightly was
indulging in silent paens of praise and
admiration scarcely once did the ship
tilt sharply-tex was literally catching it
before it started and in the blaze of the
afternoon sun the air was in a highly
scrambled condition as they came down to
live hundred feet

  the field looked good the portion where
the t was located was apparently level and
dry although at one end of the long narrow
stretch a sizeable pool of water could be
seen the smoke from ausman chimneys
was rising almost straight in the air tex
noted so the wind was of little consequence

  he circled carefully well back from the
southern boundary of the field and with his
hand on the throttle started a very gradual
dive imperceptibly the throttle crawled
back farther and farther the nose coming
down slightly to compensate

  the shot for the field could not have been
more accurate they skimmed the fence
at about fifty-five miles an hour and tex
leveled off with his wheels almost touching
the ground he inched the tail back and
landed as smoothly as it is humanly pos-
sible to set a ship down it stopped op-
posite the line-up of cars so it was only a
short taxi to the nearfest one tex looked
around as he fed the throttle slowly the
ship barely moving across the ground

  the girls face was deathly white below
carruthers huge goggles which obscured
everything except the tip of her nose her
mouth and chin but she managed a smile
nevertheless

  correll was in the van of the group of peo-
ple who had come out to see the landing
tex wasted no time in cutting his switches
smiling in spite of himself at the stark
astonishment pictured on the faces of the
dozen or so people who surrounded the ship
correll a huge portly man whose massive
legs looked like tree-trunks in army breeches
and leggings was speechless

  there was an auto wreck and we brought
this girl in said tex crisply as he climbed
out will the person who has the biggest
easiest riding car volunteer to take her
home and some one else to go for a doctor

  why its corinne weston exclaimed
a motherly looking woman as tex and
feuds end



correll lifted the girl out and removed her
goggles ill take her home poor dear
how far does she live from here asked
tex as they carried her to the big touring-
car the woman was driving

  about a mile-on the outskirts of town
she replied breathlessly bustling wildly to
get robes out of the way in the back seat
im all alone-maybe one o you gentle-
men better come along to hold her and help
her into the house it isnt likely her daddy
will be home

  go ahead jack ill be over to get my
shirt back in a few minutes said tex

  carruthers who had been unconscious
of his lightly clad condition flushed red as
fire glancing quickly at the portly lady who
was already at the wheel of the car the
little knot of curious people laughed at his
dismayed expression

  lands sake boy hop in and dont be
silly said the lady i see where your
shirts went

  as soon as miss weston and her care-
taker were ensconced as comfortably as
circumstances permitted in the roomy back
seat she started the car slowly tex who
had been somewhat dubious as to whether
she could handle the car smoothly enough
to avoid unnecessary pain to the injured
girl nodded approvingly the big machine
had started without a jerk

  shell do he told correll has any-
body gone after a doctor

  jim peebles went volunteered a straw-
sombreroed youth with a freckled face and
bare feet

  how did you get out here sergeant
asked tex as they walked back to the
ship

  ive got a jitney here-that kid in the
big hat drives me around a lot and is tickled
to death at the chance replied correll
what happened lieutenant

  tex told him the story as they adjusted
the canvas cover on the motor and propellor
and staked down the tail and wingskids
with the stakes correll had provided

  was that spig a heavy-set flashy-dressed
hombrc driving an old model roamobile
inquired correll when tex had finished

  cant swear to the make of the car but
otherwise the description fits drawled the
flyer leaning against the fuselage and rolling
a smoke

  correll glanced at the few people who
were still watching them from the road

  that would be balovo that runs a com-
bination saloon gambling-place and pool
room he said in low tones ashe turned
the cushions in the cockpits hes one

of the big toads in this puddle-and a-

peculiar puddle it is too

  so a fellow was telling me up at barnes
city replied tex rubbing one hand re-
flectively up and down his bare arm what
seems to be the lay

  nothing special except that it looks to
be sort of a wide-open joint its a teeny
little place as you can see but theres
something funny about it awful lot o
spigs here and hardly a single negro
pretty rough sort of a gang o whites and
about half of em dont seem to be doing a
thing to justify living they hang around
the main stem all afternoon and evening
well i guess we wont be here long
hows the ship coming

  pretty well but theres a lot to be done
yet motors still on the blink it was on
its back in that mud too long we just got
her right side up yesterday and the whole
fuselage has got to be re-rigged

well well get at it bright and early
in the morning is there a tractor to haul
the thing out of that swamp and over here
nary a one have to do it by mules

most of the people around here aint so-

helpful either do you want to go to mr
westons house lieutenant

yes-got to have my shirt you havent
got a coat or anything out here have you
my coveralls grinned correll and led
tex to the battered ford which -was the
private air service taxi

  the coveralls proved to be not quite long
enough and much too big around but they
were better than nothing correll went
back to the ship and got the suitcases

  the field was about a mile and a half
from the center of town and to the west
mr weston lived a little farther out his
big white house nearly a quarter mile from
its nearest neighbor although a couple of
small shacks were near-by that might be
inhabited the house was discernible from
some distance

  this weston seems to be the real
wealthy plutocrat of town correll told
tex as they bumped along the uneven little
road that led to the highway he owns
the big store-the only one in the town
worth mentioning he lends money buys
the crops of all these mexicans has the


adventure

post-office and hasnt got any competition
nears i can find out

  hes got a lot of dinero volunteered
the driver spitting over the side of the car

  apparently they learn to chew tobacco
young in this town grinned tex

  ye-ah-i been chewin since i was a
little tyke stated the youth proudly

  whos your daddy inquired tex

  he runs the hotel answered the boy

  correll leaned over to whisper in mac-
dowells ear

  ive been the only guest since i been
here they dont grow fat keepin a hotel
in this town and yet thats more than most
of the white men seem to be doing lieu-
tenant this sure is a funny town

vii

tg the rattling little car rolled up the
iffill driveway one of the most respec-
rnrmm	awns jn that part of texas

showing green and level on either side a
few gnarled mescjuite trees relieved the dead
flatness on the veranda was carruthers
now arrayed once more in his wonted od
shirt and another man the big car which
had transported them there was still stand-
ing in front as was also a runabout

  tex climbed out and ascended the steps

  how is she getting on he asked his
eyes on the face of the tall extremely thin
man who rose to meet him

  the doctor is with her now he says
shes all right except for the arm returned
the civilian

  he spoke in somewhat breathless hurried
fashion far different from macdowells soft
half-drawl

  tex macdowell meet mr weston
cut in carruthers and heres a shirt to
cover your nakedness

  already covered glad to meet you
mr weston

  the thin bony hand which was held out
to him was cold as ice mr weston met
his eyes for just a moment and then turned
awav nervously although apparently still
a man in early middle age his hair was
sprinkled with gray and the small mustache
and vandyke that he wore were likewise
sprinkled with white he was dressed neat-
ly in light summer stuff and a soft white
shirt and white shoes his panama was
hung on the back of his chair

  sit down sit down lieutenant mr-

er-carruthers tells me that youre the man
that used to be at mcmullen

  ye-es

  macdowells remarkably large wide-set
gray eyes began to glow strangely as he
uttered that one word questioningly the
merchants question had brought back to
him in a rush just who he was and the
shadow under which he was living he
waited quietly for whatever mr weston
might have to say

  their host smoked his cigar in spasmodic
jerks for a moment one foot tapping on the
porch floor

  well gentlemen he said at length
of course ther is nothing i can possibly
say to let you know how much i appreciate
what you have done it was splendid-
splendid if i could i would invite you
here but now that corinne will be laid up
i dont see how i can-dont see how i can
he jumped to his feet and began taking
long quick strides up and down the veranda

  lieutenant ma dowell there some-
thing i must tell you i-

  footsteps in the hall grew nearer and the
doctors voice could be heard as he talked
in low tones to some one with him

  -her quiet today and then tomorrow
shell feel better he said and stepped out
of the door in company with the slight
white-haired little woman who had kept
house for the westons since mrs westons
death some years before

  the doctor rather a hard-faced man but
apparently genial enough told mr weston
that his daughter could walk around in a
few days nd that the injury to the arm was
the only thing at all serious which had been
caused by the wreck both he and mrs
talbot who had driven corinne and car-
ruthers from the field treated mr weston
with evident respect

  did -you say you had something you
wanted to say to me asked tex after the
doctor and mrs talbot had driven away

  mr weston glanced nervously at the
little white-haired housekeeper who was
chatting with carruthers

  come down to the store he said his
eyes gleaming somewhat feverishly

  if youll pardon me ill just step into
the hall a minute and take off this flying-
lingerie in favor of my shirt said tex to
the little housekeeper during a lull in her
conversation with jack

  certainly certainly go right in she
feuds end



said briefly and returned to her tale of the
young girlhood of corinne weston

   carruthers tex noted was listening with
what was certainly a good imitation of
interest if it was not the real thing mr
weston went around the house after his
car

  when tex came out the two flyers took
their leave promising to call on the morrow
their young chauffeur followed mr westons
roadster to town insisting on keeping so
close that the dust came back on them in a
cloud until tex remarked

   im aiming to drive over this road again
tomorrow so i can take in some o the
scenery most of its flying through the
air right now

   ah quit yer kiddin grinned the driver
and slowed up a trifle

  isnt much to see at that observed
tex

   they were still in the outskirts of town
and almost every habitation was of the shack
variety round-eyed dirty mexican chil-
dren watched them pass the mexicans
dwellings appeared to be located without
any particular reason-few of them faced
the road and most of them were set in the
middle of fields

   mr weston is about as restful as a bomb
explosion said tex to carruthers in low
tones i wonder is there something the
matter with him or is that his natural
state

   search me but hes as bad as a waltzing
mouse seems to be nice though

   hes got a little peach of a daughter to
his credit any way hello heres the
village

bthey turned down the main high-
way which was now bordered with
fairly neat-appearing houses on the
whole although there were many in a more
or less ramshackle condition they were
set wide apart and through the intervals
between them many of the unpainted little
cabins of mexicans could be seen in the
distance the town appeared to consist
of a little nucleus of white people sur-
rounded by mexicans who lived around the
big fenced fields that stretched  away for
some miles

  the highway stretching northand south
ran within a few hundred yards of the gulf
and parallel to the shore about half-way
down the village a road branched eastward

running to the edge of the gulf of mexico
bordering this short street were the busi-
ness houses mostly one-story affairs with
false fronts

  it appeared that every male citizen of the
town must be lounging on that street from
the number of men who curiously watched
them draw up to a big square two-story
building with a road on either side that bore
the sign

james weston

general merchandise
money loaned on crops
post office ausman texas

  mr weston wanted carruthers and me
to stop here a moment tex told correll
is the hotel far from here

  no right on down the street here its
on the right hand side bang up against the
water theres a sign on it you cant miss
it suppose i take the grips down

  good and thanks sonny for the ride
welcome mumbled the boy looking
with carefully hidden admiration at the
two flyers then the youth expectorated
with much gusto and started with a jump
for the hotel

  mr weston was waiting on the porch of
the store chatting with some of the fiannel-
shirted sombreroed men who were loafing
there in various postures all restful ap-
parently they had all heard of corinne
westons airplane ride for tex and car-
ruthers got a complete and leisurely in-
spection as they mounted the steps the
store was set back somewhat from the
street and was surrounded by a porch which
was roofed only in the front on the sides
it served for a platform on which goods
could be loaded

  come in come in said the owner and
led the way with his long jerky stride

  the interior was very large with four
different rows of counters running three-
quarters of the distance back a partition
ran across the whole width of the store one
door leading into a small office and the other
into what was apparently a store-room
three or four youths one of them a mexi-
can were waiting on some customers every
conceivable branch of merchandise was rep-
resented-crockery clothing groceries
gaudy house furnishings and the like it
was a huge place given the appearance of
being crowded by the low ceiling from his
experience with general stores in texas


adventure

macdowell imagined that upstairs were
stored agricultural implements grain and
other bulky commodities

  they followed mr weston back into the
office a huge safe was the most prominent
part of its furnishings an old-fashioned
desk and armchair an antiquated filing-
cabinet and two straight chairs completed
the equipment a window and a door
opened into the back yard

  sit down sit down said their host
who seemed to have a habit of repeating
himself when he talked

  he jerked off his panama hung it on a
nail seated himself and began tapping on
his desk with his fingers his sunken over-
bright eves darted here and there and he
chewed his cigar rapidly

  lieutenant carruthers would you mind
if i had a word with lieutenant macdowell
in private he asked suddenly

  certainly not replied the flyer and

got to his feet ill-

  just a minute please tex interrupted
mr weston if im wrong correct me but
i have an idea that what you are going to
say relates somewhat perhaps to certain
peculiar things connectedwith me if so
i would like to have carruthers present
oh certainly certainly you are right
quite right but-er-i was asking more
for my own sake than yours lieutenant

  he leaped to his feet and paced the floor
rapidly pulling nervously at his vandyke

  oh well in that case-

  never mind never mind interrupted
the storekeeper with uplifted hand doesnt
make much difference

  he closed the door with a bang and then
leaned close to the two flyers his eyes a
hunted furtive light in them burned into
macdowells

  i shouldnt say this-shouldnt say it
it would be most horrible if a living soul
aside you two ever know that i have said it
but i must-i must lieutenant mac-
dowell get away from ausman get away
right away believe me you must

  may i ask why drawled tex lounging
easily in his chair his eyes fixed unwavering-
ly on mr weston

  no i cant tell you its a friendly
warning

  once again he started that nervous pac-
ing his face working apparently he was
under some terrific strain for he was com-
pletely unstrung

   tex climbed to his feet slowly

  thank you mr weston he said slow-
ly his eyes never leaving the merchants
face i think i am getting a glimmer of

what you mean if im right-

  no no i cant tell you you mustnt
ask me indeed you mustnt you dont

know what i am risking in even-

  dont worry mr weston tex cut in
his voice more gentle than usual as was
always the case when he felt that a contest
of any kind was looming before him what-
ever i think i know is mostly the result of
what has happened before i came here and
it only needed an inkling of some kind for
me to jump to conclusions im on my
guard and nobodys going to know what
woke me up in case anything happens
any acquaintance between us is the result
of whatever we were able to do for miss
corinne good afternoon and thanks
carruthers was agog with curiosity and
pleasant excitement little as he knew of
the circumstances surrounding macdowells
arrest for carrying opium and his previous
escapes from unpleasant entanglements
along the border he felt in the cryptic
conversation he had just listened to an
undercurrent of meaning which seemed to
indicate that wider forces were at work than
were compassed in the straggling little town
of ausman nevertheless he did not ask
any questions but walked down the sun-
scorched street as silently as tex himself

  they were opposite the open doors of
what appeared to be a large soft-drink place
fitted up exactly like a saloon and tex
glanced in a number of men were standing
along the bar and two or three of them
looked out at the flyers one man turned
his head back quickly in the dim shadow
of the place his face was but vaguely defined
but as they walked on tex strove to place
what had appeared like a familiar face

  now where in- he said aloud slap-
ping his thigh with the helmet he carried
in his hands his thoughtful gaze on the
sidewalk

  he did not finish what he had started
to say so carruthers inquired

  where in-what

  by the mighty beers

   you sure have been talking fiji the last
few minutes complained carruthers
there are no beers nowadays tex its

hot enough-	

   jack weve fallen into something stated
feuds end



tex his gray eyes alight with a leaping
dancing flame that gave the lie to his out-
ward air of lounging ease

  what the deal tex

  listen jack its bound up i believe
with the things that have been happening
to me for some months past the last shot
was the opium deal at donovan what
mr weston hinted at has almost been
labeled by the man i just saw in that place
down the street unless im badly mistaken
im due for another session with my friend
dave fitzpatrick although just what the
lay is i dont know if you dont mind im
going to shoot off my face a little to you and
correll because if fitzpatrick tries to work
on me here you two are liable to be roped
in on it just the way george hickman is in
the soup with me right now im going to
give you all the dope ive got and you can
use your own judgment heaven knows i
dont want you two caught in the net
tex id give my little finger for a good
scrap with that old geezer i dont know
why on earth you should be afraid of him
here though this is a long way from his
hangout isnt it but if you really have
got some reason for thinking hes got in-
fluence here why not beat it old man and
avoid getting into further trouble good

- man-

  thats not it jack boy im sure
watching my step but im figuring that
maybe by hook or crook if i could get next
to the deal down here i might just hop
on to something that would help clear up

this-- mess theyve got me in right now

on this opium but lets rope in the ser-
geant and collect all the cards so youll each
have a good look at the deck before you
decide to horn in on the game i hope
you wont

  they had been standing on the walk in
front of the large white house which bore
the faded sign ausman house as its only
mark of being a hotel it faced the street
the waters of the gulf only a hundred feet
from one side of it a steep bank fell off
sheer from the level of the town to the water
fifty feet below

  they had just started up the walk when
the burly figure of sergeant correll emerged
from the doorway

  ive got your rooms yelled cprrell
your suitcases are up there now

  thanks come here a minute will you
sergeant

correll joined them and they
walked slowly to the edge of the
bank where they stretched them-
selves on the grass as briefly as possible
tex sketched his experiences with the un-
crowned king of the border he told them
how his father had been the means of fitz-
patricks disgrace and exile years before
and how fitzpatrick had tried to use his
immense influence and power to revenge
himself on macdowell senior by entangling
tex himself in some criminal thing that
would result in his being disgraced and his
life ruined

  the point is this tex told them puff-
ing slowly on a cigaret as he gazed across
the waters of the gulf into the mist that
veiled the water several miles out i just
saw one of the men that was in that crooked
poker game in el paso when fitzpatricks
men tried to get me a couple of thousand
dollars in debt so that he would have a hold
on me hitch that up with mr westons
warning and i have a hunch that the an-
swer is that for some reason or other fitz-
patrick has a hold on this town seems far-
fetched but im-if i dont believe it

  correll had been following macdowells
narrative closely nodding agreement from
time to time he spoke now for the first
time since tex had started talking

  lieutenant i was a cavalryman for
twenty years before i joined the first aero
squadron the army ever had he stated
and about twelve of them years i spent
along the border you cant tell me nothin
about dave fitzpatrick that i wont be-
lieve-if its bad it aint impossible at all
that hes got a finger in this ausman pie
he runs ninety per cent of the crooked
work from san diego to brownsville-i
know that for a fact just what he could
use this town for-

  we may be able to figure that out
said tex now heres the meat on the
end of the stick hes got me roped now on
this opium deal-the newspapers have seen
to it that i became known as an opium-

carrier and im in a- of a mess right

now but if beers is here as fitzpatricks
man and if fitzpatrick runs the powers that
be in this town like he does a lot of border
towns ill be mightily mistaken if he dont
try to make assurance doubly sure by roping
me tighter while hes got me here another
scandal for one loot macdowell would just
about finish the beans wouldnt it


adventure

  sure would agreed carruthers

  correll nodded slowly

  well enough of that i just wanted
to warn you fellows to watch your step and
dont get mixed in with any trouble that

may come along i-

  what are you plannin to do yourself
if you dont mind me askin asked the
grizzled old sergeant his keen eyes fixed on
the cleancut features of the texan

  im planning to watch my step just
like i advised you but im going to keep
a weather eye out for picking up anything
that may put a crimp into not only any
game that may be started here but may-
be-just maybe mind you-i might get
hold of somethingthat would help clear me
on this opium scrape

  tex didnt know it but in the expression
of that determination to stand by his job
at ausman despite the possibility of another
run-in with the tremendously powerful and
unscrupulous enemy who had already placed
him with his back to the wall he clinched
the feeling of respect and admiration that
had already begun to develop in the mind
of hard-boiled old sergeant correll and
the sergeant was an ally not to be despised

  im satisfied to stack in with you if
theres trouble lieutenant he said

  you know me tex put in carruthers
thanks i suspect we may be making
a mountain out of a molehill-somehow or
other it doesnt seem possible that old fitz-
patrick would have his claws in very deep
way up here i almost hope he has and
that he shows his hand dad is busy as

i told you but its going to be a-long

pull before he finds out anything that will
clear me of having a few hundred dollars
worth of opium in my ship it might just be
possible that i could get hold of somebody
here who would know the rights of that deal
and i could choke the truth out of him

  i sure hope so lieutenant said correll
meditatively chewing a blade of grass as he
talked but as near as i can figure there
isnt any one man that knows a quarter of
what fitzpatrick is up to hes got most
of the admitted bad-men and a lot of camou-
flaged crooks in white collars working for
him up and down the border but each of
em knows only his section of some particu-
lar smuggling deal or whatever it is
most of the white-collar boys are men
fitzpatrick has framed arent they in-
quired carruthers

p yes sir i only know one that i could
put my finger on-he was a customs man
that lost a bunch of dough over to juarez
one night and fell for a bribe the next day

he got caught but was so - scared o

fitzpatrick that he wouldnt tell a thing
its like all the rest of the rustlers smug-
glers and half the killers theyve got through

the big bend-not a- one of em will

talk when they get caught fitzpatrick sure
has em buffaloed

  well lets go and wash up said tex
coming slowly to his feet how are the
meals at yon palatial hostelry

  pretty good and say lieutenant the
more i think of this town the more i think
maybe we aint far off in keeping a weather
eye on our old friend fitz i told you it was
a funny town and im getting a nick
carter theory in my head that may be
shootin near the mark

  the sergeant was undoubtedly serious in
what he said and he met macdowells
quizzical gaze without smiling

  whats your idea inquired the texan
as they strolled around the house-it was
more of a house than a hotel-to the front
door

  im just going to let you have a look
at the town for a night before i tell you-
then it wont sound so foolish grinned

the bogie bill show was a texas
institution where bill drumm got
the name bogie tacked on to his
cognomen nobody seemed to know but as
bogie bills show his outfit had played
through the small towns of the southwest
for years all the old-timers were familiar
with it and in countless small towns his
coming was looked forward to as one of the
leading events of the year rivaling in im-
portance a county-seat barbecue baseball
championship game and band concert com-
bined

  he ran an old-time wild west show pure
and simple the show carried a string of
twenty or more horses mostly either natural
or trained buckers and he always managed
to have at least a couple of outlaws that
were really tough medicine for the best of
riders he carried eight or ten riders and
ropers the number varying greatly accord-
ing to the personal idiosyncrasies of the per-
formers who were all cowhands who wanted

to try something new drumms daughter
maisie was heavily billed as the worlds
champion woman rider roper and shot and
to an unprejudiced eye the claim was not
greatly exaggerated although as far as any-
body knew maisie had no official right to
the title

  a small carnival which included a great
variety of side-shows always traveled along
with the show and owing to the wide ac-
quaintance of bogie bill his show usually
took on the aspect of a town fair the
forty-nine girls fatima the fat woman
and a few midgets had been institutions with
the show ever since it started it might be
added that a number of too skillful card
players and other light-fingered gentry had
traveled along with drumm for so many
years that every one in texas should have
known them and in fact a lot of people did
nevertheless when the show was in town it
appeared as if everything went in good
old western style

  some few days before the arrival of tex
macdowell in ausman the show pitched its
tents in south san antonio less than a mile
from the eastern entrance of donovan field
and about three miles from the center of the
city it had been a long time since drumm
had essayed a big town and apparently the
chance was a good one for at eight oclock
every seat was full and the sidewalls had
been rolled up to allow standees to peek
through the aisle-spaces at a quarter each

  the carnival side-shows were doing a
rushing business and the hoarse cries of the
barkers split the air with raucous sound
that almost drowned the wheezes and groans
of a couple of hurdy-gurdies flaring gaso-
line torches illumined the grounds fitfully

  the show was in three sections the
first section consisted of fancy riding of all
descriptions done by bogies staff of riders
and climaxed by the work of his daughter
maisie then there was roping and fancy
shooting and finally the big feature of the
show-the riding of bucking ponies the
grand finale was an attempt by every rider
in the outfit to stick on the two outlaws
and a standing reward of fifty dollars in
gold to any one in the audience who could
stay on sunfish a mangy bony old war-
horse who was named for his polished and
unusual ability at performing that well-
known maneuver

  the first section was well under way and
bogie bill a squat jovial red-faced old

veteran of the west was rubbing his hands
gleefully at the interest the show had
aroused in san antonio he saw a solid week
of good business at the one stand if his luck
held and he got a good weather break

  it was blackie stearns turn to show
and for some reason he did not appear on
the little black pony as the wait became
longer drumms face grew dark stearns
had caused him trouble before-he wondered
whether he had got hold of liquor again

  he was starting back for the horse tent
when finally the flaps separating the canvas
corral and the main tent opened and stearns
appeared on black bess he was extremely
tall long legged and broad shouldered the
appearance of his rather handsome face
spoiled by a deep frown that seemed to be
everpresent drumm noted with rising
wrath that there was a flush on his riders
face tonight that bespoke indulgence in
john barleycorn

  as he entered the riding tent stearns
roweled his little black horse viciously
the mare taken by surprize bucked so
suddenly that the tall rider was nearly un-
seated stearns was a good rider-better
than most of the staff drumm carried with
the show-but the unlooked-for pitch of the
horse plus the overload of liquor that he
carried made him look suspiciously like
a tyro

  haw haw haw came loudly from
a stout loud-voiced man on the front row

  the ungovernable temper that had kept
jim stearns almost an outcast for five years
flamed up in instant response to the con-
temptuous laugh which had started a series
of snickers his wrath plus his drinking
made him totally unmindful of anything but
getting at the one who had given vent to
that amused scornful laugh like a flash
he was off his horse and had started for the
loud-voiced spectator

  when drumm and three of the riders
arrived on the scene stearns was being held
by four men still fighting wildly his face
was convulsed with the wild lust to get at
his man

 get out of here you--fool

snarled drumm and with the aid of his
riders he yanked and pushed the still-
fighting stearns back into the horse tent

  get out there and ride roared the in-
censed owner to pete driggs who was next
in order as for you come to the office
and get your time


adventure

  stearns followed the bulky boss out of
the tent and into a small one which served
as office and living-quarters for drumm

  bogie bill turned on the sullen stearns
with glittering eyes

  youll spoil my show will you you
blankety blank booze-guzzling chicken-

livered-

  he never got any further stearns pulled
the colt which all the riders wore for
atmosphere when showing and which
was loaded for the shooting exhibition

  the crack of the shot seemed to rever-
berate with hideous sound in the tent as
drumm fell wondering disbelief in his eyes
he was dead before he struck the ground

 all the insane passion left stearns as his
erstwhile employer struck the wooden
flooring of the tent ever since he could
remember the sullen riders life had been
a series of escapades ranging from negligi-
ble scrapes to almost life-and-death im-
broglios but this was the climax of them
all the die was cast

he was perfectly cool and alert
suddenly as he crowded the body
beneath the low cot and draped the
blanket down to hide it he quickly re-
placed the spent shot in the magazine clip
listening closely the while apparently the
shot had gone unnoticed in all the turmoil
of cheering spectators in the show proper
plus the manifold noises of the carnival
drumms tent was on the opposite side of
the show tent from that used by the carni-
val and unless some one in the horse tent
had heard it his chances of a few hours
respite were good drumm was often hard
to find while the show was going on and
his absence would arouse no suspicion

  encouraged by the fact that no one had
appeared stearns took time to hide the
body underneath a pile of saddles and blan-
kets that were lying in one corner of the
tent first he pulled out a well-filled pock-
etbook from the dead mans pocket then
he stole out skirting the carnival at a safe
distance and headed for the southern pa-
cific railroad tracks which ran past dono-
van field less than a mile away

  from moment to moment he stopped to
listen but there were no signs of pursuit
with luck it might be that he could reach
the border the more he thought of it the
more he was encouraged to- hope that it
would be morning before the body was

found he had hidden it well beneath the
high-piled saddles and blankets

  blackie stearns possessed no idea of
right and wrong-his creed had always been
to get away with as much as was safely
possible he was as cool and nerveless as
if nothing had happened as he lay beneath
the shelter of some bushes along the railroad
track the black ungovernable rage that
possessed him at times had at last been his
undoing-and in some ways he was glad

  for years he had drifted from job to job
from fight to fight because sooner or later
he alienated every one around him wher-
ever he was he was hard bitter unre-
pentant if he should be able to get across
the rio grande he would not greatly regret
the shooting of bogie bill

  stearns knew the border and he knew
what he would do when he got there so
he lay quietly and strained his eyes toward
san antonio looking for a headlight to
loom up northward

  fortune favored him a freight slowing
for the donovan field crossing passed his
hiding-place slowly enough for him to risk
boarding it running with the train he
managed to catch a ladder and swing
aboard the freight picked up speed and
set out on the trip to laredo

         ix

two men were sitting on the small
veranda of a big two-story struc-
ture a hundred yards south of the
rio grande the same two men had sat
there at intervals many times before and
should one who had been present at their
last interview nearly two months before
come upon them this particular night it
would have seemed as if they had not
moved the squat powerfully built one sat
in a big crude armchair the smaller man
was squatting on his heels against the wall

  the veranda was at the rear of the big
building which was the general store of
dave fitzpatrick tia nita mexico the
collection of unpainted board buildings
that surrounded the store was owned lock
stock and barrel by the massive gray-
haired man in the chair

  it was late in the afternoon and the sun
was sinking in crimson glory in a few
moments the semi-tropic twilight would
descend with what would be startling swift-
ness farther north
feuds end



  you arrived at the right time searles
fitzpatrick was saying his light eyes gazing
steadily at the fringe of scrubby growth
that outlined the banks of the river

  his mouth which seemed like a wide
almost lipless slit in his square face scarcely
moved as he spoke his face was without
tan or wrinkle the skin stretched so tightly
across the bony framework that it seemed
as if a hollow or a wrinkle in it would be
impossible

  searles showed the effects of many years
along the border his lined face was brown
and leathery the eyes in a perpetual squint
his sandy hair was thin andalmost color-
less he was clasping his knees with big
gnarled hands thatjjwere like old mahogany
in their coloring he did not answer fitz-
patrick but as was his custom remained
silent until words were absolutely necessary

  fitzpatrick apparently did not expect
any answer he seemed to be thinking
deeply as he gazed with unwinking steadi-
ness straight ahead of him finally he
went on

  i heard from beers up at ausman
today young macdowell is there-flew
in and will be there a few days got in
yesterday 

  his voice was level and expressionless
not a hint of shading varied his words
there was a curious impression of cold
passionless power about the man whose
whole body seemed to be as motionless as
though made of stone not even a finger
moved

  searles who was small middle aged
utterly neutral-looking still maintained his
silence he took out the makings rolled
himself a cigaret and lit it

  the last time you were here i gave you
my reasons for crushing young macdow-
ell-for doing to his father what he did to
me twenty years ago i broke my rule in
telling you for the first time in my life
weasel williams failed although mac-
dowell seems to be hooked right now his
being in ausman is too good an opportunity
to clinch matters remember what i told
you-that when i finally see him ruined
i leave the border country i have waited
a long time for my opportunity you your-
self will go to ausman to handle the thing
you know what i have never told any other
living man and therefore you will know
better than to fall down

  without varying his voice in any way

without even the suspicion of loudness or
emphasis fitzpatricks words conveyed
a depth of cold bitter venomous resolution
that no one-least of all searles-could
mistake

  searles expelled a cloud of smoke from
his lungs before he replied his words
seemed to be irrelevant

  what are you going to do about wea-
sel-leave him in jail he asked

  searles had been serving fitzpatrick well
for ten years and of all the countless men
who obeyed their chief from ignorant mexi-
cans to men of supposed wealth and stand-
ing he was closest to him the greatest of
the mexican bandits with whom fitzpatrick
carried on his traffic in many things-in-
formation as well as merchandise-would
have thought many times before asking
him a question as to his plans about any-
thing save the matter immediately in hand

  fitzpatrick replied briefly after a long
pause

  weasel failed to get away with stealing
that carburetor macdowell and cary in-
vented didnt he hes off the list his
case might be a warning to you searles

  the imperturbable searles took another
drag at his cigaret his calm untroubled

  then you dont think that the planted
opium and all the stir thats being made over
it is enough to fix on this here macdowell
he asked rocking gently on his heels

  probably it is i understand that bill
macdowell was down to san antone and
that he is stirring up a lot of action along
the border he was at the bottom of that
pick-up near del rio the other night i
imagine hes a big man in texas but he
doesnt know that manuel veriga is in
mexico city

  so manny planted the stuff in the ship
did he

  yes and saved his hide by getting away
with it too snow in san antone was
primed to pick it up

  the conversation was so utterly quiet and
unemotional that it would have worn on the
nerves of almost any one but the two men
themselves the torpid fitzpatrick seemed
to have a quality of resistless power about
him although it would be puzzling to
try to analyze any particular source of
the impression his smooth square face
which seemed in the half-light to have
a gray tinge that harmonized with the
grizzled hair and gray flannel shirt was


adventure

more like a mask than a human counte-
nance-the long narrow eyes mirrored
none of the thoughts or emotions within
searles was as he had been for many years-
not even fitzpatrick had ever succeeded in
making him give any indication of either
fear or enthusiasm

  it was significant of fitzpatrick that
searles should ask that question as to the
identity of the man who had succeeded in
planting the contraband stuff in mac-
dowells ship searles knew more about
the extent of his chiefs operations than
any other four men and yet he was con-
stantly learning more and more of how
really far-reaching the strings were that
centered in tia nita

  with manuel in mexico city i reckon
macdowell is hooked near as i can figure
its going to take a confession to get the
youngster out o that aint it

  yes im keeping the pot boiling in
san antonio if necessary sallman can
start digging away at the war department
in washington but it will be quicker
action to rope and hog-tie macdowell for
good in ausman

  searles remembered with the ghost of
a smile how he had been shaken to his spurs
as he expressed it when he had first heard
fitzpatrick carelessly mention the name of
sallman who was somewhat of a power in
the national administration more than
any other single thing in all his years as an
underling of the man sitting beside him that
name had shown him what kind of an or-
ganization fitzpatrick had under him

  he had known of chinamen bandit
chiefs gunmen judges bankers and at
least one mayor of a sizeable town who were
eating out of the hand of the man who was
ostensibly the keeper of a general store he
knew of one revolution in mexico largely
promoted by that same merchant but some-
how the knowledge that one of his under-
lings was serving in a position of trust and
power in the nations capitol was more
impressive than all of fitzpatricks other
human and official machinery combined

  he did not ask for any details regarding
the projected trip to ausman but smoked
tranquilly and waited the velvet dusk
was commencing to soften the outlines of
the mesquite and veil the ugliness of the
rough buildings and the vanguard of the
stars shone palely widely scattered across
the darkening sky

  fitzpatrick was silent likewise only
the low hiss of the rio grande and the
noises of stirring night things marred the
stillness when a low knock came to their
ears from within the store fitzpatricks
living-quarters opened off the veranda on
which they were sitting

  what is it

  the level voice was no louder than when
he had been talking to searles but the an-
swer came promptly in liquid spanish

  a man who wishes to see you sehor

  who is it

  he will not say setior jose and i
stopped him he was riding from nueva
laredo to see the senor he said he is
young and tall

  light the lamp and bring him around
here

   si sefior

  in a moment the soft light of a big
white-shaded lamp glowed through the
open door searles seemed to sink into
deeper shadow against the wall fitz-
patrick as if carved from stone was like-
wise in shadow not even a hand had
moved since the start of his conversation
with searles

  in a moment a young mexican appeared
around the corner of the building guiding
blackie stearns the mexican stopped
a few feet from the veranda and indicated
it to stearns with a wave of his hand then
he took up his station by the corner out of
earshot two guns sagged from his belt

  stearns walked slowly up to the porch
striving to pierce the gloom that half-veiled
the two men

  dave fitzpatrick he inquired a touch
of brsvado in his words

  as he stood in the light streaming from
the doorway the marks of his journey
showed plainly on his rather gaudy cos-
tume-red bandanna blue flannel shirt and
much filigreed boots he was dressed as he
had been for the show his face was
haggard and dirty but the broad shoulders
were held well back and his tall figure was
straight

  there was an appreciable interval before
fitzpatrick spoke

  well he said finally

  im here after a job stated stearns
his hard bold eyes on fitzpatrick

  the rider got a curious impression that
the light eyes of the man before him would
shine like a cats at night-they seemed to
feuds end



be more obvious than any other detail of
fitzpatricks appearance in the deepening
twilight

   well said fitzpatrick again

   the icy inscrutability of the man to whom
he was talking began to affect stearns with
much the same sort of half-hypnotism that
a snake exercises stearns knew his border
through hard experience and the knowl-
edge of who fitzpatrick was plus the in-
fluence of his physical nearness sent the
rider into a species of half-fearful nervous-
ness his next words were like the slightly
hysterical bravado of a man who is defying
he knows not what

   if you cant use me ill blow but id
like to know

   fitzpatrick refused to be hurried there
was another interval during which the
murderer of bogie bill stirred restlessly
despite himself

   how long has it been since you had any-
thing to eat asked fitzpatrick suddenly
his words as flat and emotionless as ever

   this morning returned stearns glanc-
ing surprizedly from searles to his chief
and back again

  tell jose to fix you up and bring you
back in half an hour

  stearns started to speak and then
checked himself with an effort he turned
without a word and strode off toward the
mexican who was still lounging against the
corner of the store his cigaret glowing
dully

  searles did you notice that man

  how

  remind you of anybody

   not especially

  do you think that in the dark with
a uniform and a mask he might make it
hard for anybody who hadnt seen him close
to swear that it was not macdowell say
in ausman

   searles considered the matter leisurely
the two men were built alike-tall rangy
broad-shouldered their faces while there
was no resemblance were of the same cast
although stearns was sullen and scowling
the little texan finally nodded

  i reckon maybe-in ausman he stated

  for the next half-hour fitzpatrick did
what he would do perhaps with no other
man than searles and for no other enter-
prise than the one which meant the satisfy-
ing of a twenty-year lust for vengeance-
talked over his plans with another man

as quietly and casually as if httle depended
on it although with a subtle undercurrent
that was deadly in its resolution fitz-
patrick talked and searles mostly listened
his lined face showing no slightest indication
that he realized what the project might
mean to him

  when stearns returned and jose had
taken up his former position at the comer
fitzpatrick said-

  stearns i can-

  the tall rider jumped as if he had been
shot

  -use you for a while if you succeed it
will be worth your while-and it wont be
as dangerous as shooting bogie bill drumm
if you fail-

  the cold voice ceased but stearns
scarcely noticed his mind was in a whirl
at the realization that already fitzpatrick
knew who he was he was hooked more
tightly at the start than he had expected
suddenly the massive sphinx-like bulk
looming vaguely from the huge arm chair
took on an additional sinister power to the
nerve-shaken criminal he felt helpless
and could not explain exactly why

  you will go to ausman texas with
searles here and be under his orders you
have nothing to fear from the shooting in
san antonio-providing you do what you
are told you will be instructed there as to
what youre expected to do

  for just a moment fitzpatricks eyes
darted rapidly to the squatting figure of
searles and then back to the sullen young
rider before him

  a day or two after you arrive in ausman
-by boat-i will be there to instruct you
myself he said

  for once at least searles was completely
and obviously astonished

x

 sergeant correll and the
iss-gj two flyers got to work bright and
early the day following the arrival
of the loaded ship in ausman the re-
construction of a wrecked ship in the field is
always a long and tedious job particularly
so in this case because the ship had been
upside down in the mud for many hours

  correll had put all his time on the motor
as soon as he had succeeded in getting the
ship right side up again the more obvious
damage to the eight cylinder engine had


adventure

been rectified but there remained the job of
checking up the delicate timing by which
magnetos camshafts crankshaft and other
things work in delicate synchronization
there was rust and dirt to wipe from con-
tact points and distributor plugs and six-
teen spark-plugs to remove and inspect
all day the three airmen occasionally com-
pelled to wait for a tool from their scanty
kit fussed over the all-important motor

  it was a rather silent day on the whole
until late afternoon tex was thinking of
his predicament and still more of the possi-
ble opportunity of locking horns with his
nemesis again in ausman the evening
before the three army men had set out to
see the town and it bore out the comments
of both correll and the good samaritan in
barnes city there was little really tangi-
ble evidence tex reflected and yet there
was an indefinable atmosphere that set the
little village apart in his experience

  true there were many men who showed
the effects of liquor-more than usual in
a town so far from the border but nothing
unusual for a man accustomed to towns
lying close to the rio grande balavo the
mexican of the automobile wreck owned
a place which was rather curious from the
impression one gained from the wide-open
doors and borne out by sergeant correll
who had visited it

  apparently it was a real old-fashioned
saloon dance-hall and gambling-place tex
had yearned to go inside and look beyond
the swinging-doors in the back of the saloon
itself three weeks before he would have but
now the reckless young pilot was not court-
ing useless complications for the mere joy of
the struggle-any chance he might take
would be a carefully calculated one in aus-
man

  it was apparent to a casual observer that
the law represented almost solely by one
vancouver b dale extended potent pro-
tection to open lawbreaking so far as the
serving of the cup that cheers went but
there were other things which seemed to
hint aggravatingly at more extensive and
subtle differences in the town there was
the complete lack of negroes and the over-
whelming percentage of mexicans for in-
stance

  then the fact that for all practical pur-
poses mr james weston had the only store
of any consequence in the town aside from
a restaurant a candy and ice-cream place

and a few other minor businesses and
there was sergeant corrells word that not
one in ten of the white men appeared to
have a thing in the world to do

  correll was not habitually talkative es-
pecially in the presence of his superiors
tex was engrossed in his own thoughts and
carruthers in his as they worked busily
carruthers if the truth were to be told was
devoting considerable mental attention to
corinne weston unconsciously the few con-
versations he started reflected his thoughts
and the ever-observant tex grinned to him-
self

  late in the afternoon just as they were
preparing to knock off work for the day
tex gave utterance for the first time to his
thoughts regarding the possible complica-
tions that might arise from his presence in
ausman

  ive been trying to figure this town all

day and ill be-if im not stumped

he observed wrenching a spark-plug home
with a last turn at the plug-wrench

  he was perched on top of the motor his
long legs dangling

  correll who was tracking the propeller
by means of a box and a hub wrench
stopped work for a moment and wiped the
perspiration from his red fleshy face

  lieutenant some time or other im
going to spring my theory on you when i
get the nerve it dont sound reason-
able-

  oh ive got more than half an idea that
fitzpatricks got his claws in here but it
sounds so-foolish returned tex lay-
ing aside his wrench for a moment what
in the world beers would be doing here
i dont know but on the other hand what
would fitzpatrick be doing nosing around
this town

  correll sat on the box by means of which
he had been measuring the track of the
propeller as it swung and lit a big black
pipe

  theres something funny about the law
in this town aint there he inquired
oratorically

  right admitted carruthers coming
out of his trance

  and theres too many mexicans and
too few darkies aint there

  well its unusual anyway said tex
watching the burly sergeant with a whimsi-
cal expression

  he knew that old correll was getting at
feuds end



something but it was amusing to see him
trying to persuade himself with laborious
logic that he was not talking wild west
fiction

  did you ever take a look at fitzpatricks
hangout tia nita or hear about it was
the old cavalry sergeants next query

  no except that it was just a little
mexican town like a dozen other hamlets
along the border

  well the truth of the matter is that
fitzpatrick owns hundreds-yes by cripes
thousands-of acres of land-just about

the whole - country around tia nita

he lets it out to the mexicans on shares or
something makes em do all their trading
at thatstore of his and has em in the hollow
of his hand they dont dare blow their
noses-or wouldnt if a spig ever blew his
nose-without askin him hes like a king
with em get the idea

  that all these mex people around here
are on the same basis

  they do all the cultivatin of the land
dont they

  carruthers who had long since finished
cleaning out the oil tank with gasoline and
was now smoking restfully as he sat on one
wheel slapped his thigh enthusiastically

  by jupiter tex i believe correll is
right

  tex looked at correll with quizzical
admiration vague ideas of a similar
nature had been running through his own
head ever since the warning of mr weston
had been backed by the sight of beers-or
the man he thought was beers he was
glad that some one else had the same idea
and he enjoyed listening to the almost pain-
fully serious sergeant work his theories out
he had not suspected that old correll was
as keen as his words were showing him to be

  what would you say about-mr wes-
ton he seems to be the big gun here
inquired tex rolling a cigaret deftly

  thats kind of got me stopped un-
less-

  he stopped in embarrassment he didnt
know just what degree of friendship existed
between the flyers and the westons tex
grinned down at carruthers frorti his lofty
perch

  as long as our remarks are confined to
mr weston why lets speak freely he
said

  it may seem queer to you lieutenant
but ive known of one man-and heard of

a lot more-that was roped and hog-tied by
fitzpatrick-that would stack up bigger
than weston by a long row of beans de-
clared correll

  well time will tell said tex vaulting
to the ground lets pick up and get gone
from here

  i think we ought to drop in and see how
miss weston is coming said carruthers
as the three men started collecting the tools
and inserting them in their proper niches in
the tool-kit

  i dont know-might cause a relapse if
she had too much excitement replied tex
with a wink at the sergeant

  carruthers laughed good-naturedly

  its the proper thing to do and you know
it he stated besides you may pick up
some dope from her father if hes around
your guard is going and refuses to let his
prisoner out of his sight

  i have no choice then is our private
jitney going to be here this afternoon
correll

  yes sir four oclock you couldnt
pry that kid loose from us with a crowbar
he thinks a flyer is the next thing to the
twelve apostles

  they finished wrapping the tools and
then covered up with canvas covers motor
propeller and rear cockpit which were ex-
posed to the weather this finished they
reclined in the shade of a wing to await the
coming of their car

  returning to the main topic what do
you two sherlocks figure fitzpatrick would
have his hand in here for asked car-
ruthers

  well i dont know ive got a good
theory but according to the best detective
fiction it is very easy to twist facts to fit
theories but concentrate your massive

intellect on a few queries now-

  i doubt whether i can comprehend your
questions through the word barrage youre
putting out but go ahead

  from what youve heard of fitzpatrick
what is his main source of income

  why smuggling dope and liquor from
mexico and guns and things back over i
guess

  thats a good guess put in correll
very ausman is right on the gulf
isnt it and some of those launches and
things could be used to transport contra-
band goods from a small steamer to land
couldnt they


adventure

  correll slapped his thigh enthusiastically
as he burst forth

  what ive been thinkin to a t lieuten-
ant and all these cars around here which
i cant see the reason for could be used
mighty well carryin drugs up to san
antone corpus christi houston and so
forth couldnt they and theres three or
four trucks in town too it would be
a mint

  beneath the surface facetiousness of mac-
dowells manner there had been a subtle
undercurrent that was profoundly serious
the full possibilities of a small isolated
town such as ausman controlled entirely
for all practical purposes by fitzpatrick
located on the gulf had been growing in
his mind ever since the definite suspicion
that his enemy had a foothold evidence
from correll and carruthers that his care-
fully built-up theories were not too fantastic
gave his suspicions additional strength

  just look what it would mean he told
them as his eyes rested on a cloud of dust
that was rising from the rough country road
half a mile away if fitzpatrick had
a small boat of some kind that could make
the trip from some small mexican port he
could unload at night in ausman and then
it would be dead easy for his henchmen here
to get the stuff-small but very valuable
commodities like drugs-to any of the near-
by cities in all kinds of ways if half the
mail and express of this town contained
some and the autos carried considerable
and even people making personal trips on
the train should carry gripfuls of it to de-
liver to designated agents-

  they never would stand a chance of
being searched either correll declared
lieutenant unless our original idee is dead
wrong-about fitzpatrick actually being

the toad in this-peculiar puddle-ill

stake a nickel or two we aint far off

  -if i dont believe correll is right

carruthers stated say all these spigs or
most of em were under fitzpatricks
thumb and a lot of the white men includ-
ing the big bugs like dale the town mar-
shal and mr weston and this balavo-why
thousands of dollars worth of stuff a week
could pass through here and nobody know
well heres our chariot said tex un-
coiling his long length lazily lets hie
to the house of the fair invalid and her st
vitus daddy-bless him for dropping that
hint

  ill bet it cost him somethin too said
correll as they walked toward the car i
believe we-or rather you-have got the
jump on his nibs lieutenant	

  once before i was lucky enough to have
advance information about him and it net-
ted me two thousand bucks macdowell
remarked if ive got it again and in
some way or other could rook him once
more id cheerfully donate that two thou-
sand and a lot more

  heres hoping said carruthers correll
didnt say anything but he thought to him-
self i may be in my second childhood but
i smell something coming if it comes my
bets are that the lieutenant wont come in
last

  a few minutes later the two flyers were
greeting corinne who was reclining on a
lounge which had been moved to the porch

  they were talking gaily as her fathers
car drove up to the gate

  mr weston strode up the path hurriedly
his gaunt face looking even worse than it
had the day before

  afternoon afternoon boys and hows
the little girl this afternoon

  doing nicely thank you she replied as
he bent and kissed her lightly the arms
not so bad and ive had a lot of callers-
daddy george was here quite a while this
afternoon

  so he said so he said her father said
fanning himself rapidly with his hat old
fellowr thats been with me for years and
years-employ him as a night-watchman at
the store just to give him something to do
lives in a little shack over at the other end
o town quite an old character

  though the description was for the bene-
fit of the flyers their host did not look at
them directly asingle time his eyes darted
rapidly from object to object never focusing
for more than an instant

  corinnes eyes were shadowed with worry
as she looked at her father and some of the
brightness left her face

  fathers too modest to tell it himself
but several years ago he sent daddy and
his wife aunt judy oiit to california to try
and save poor aunt judys life she did
live several months longer on account of it
since then daddy has been like a shadow-
always with us we were living in el paso
then

  mind if i smoke inquired tex casu-
ally
feuds end



  of course not i wouldnt know father
without a cigar laughed the girl

  as he rolled the cigaret tex glanced up
at carruthers to see whether corinnes
remark about living in el paso had made
any impression on him but carruthers had
neither eyes nor thoughts for anything but
corinne

  a rattlesnake might be clicking his tail
within two feet of jack and hed never know
it right this minute tex remarked to him-
self lighting the slim cigaret which was
a counterpart of his fathers favorite smoke

  mr macdowell have you ever seen my
chickens got some pure-bred white leg-
horns-greatest layers in the world-great-
est layers in the world said mr weston
abruptly removing his half-chewed cigar
and clawing at his thin vandyke nervously

  no and id sure like to see them re-
turned tex

  excuse us a minute-wont take but
a minute said mr weston and he and
tex disappeared around the corner of the
house

carruthers and the girl were
silent a moment finally corinne
took her eyes from the battered au-
tomobile which was still waiting a few yards
down the driveway and looked at carruth-
ers her hazel eyes dark and troubled

  im so worried about dad she said
with a little catch in her voice

  he-he doesnt seem to be very well
said carruthers awkwardly

  i cant imagine what is the matter with
him but ever since we came here he has
been different i went to san marcos to
school a couple of years and when i got
back two years ago i noticed the change in
him sometimes hes so queer-and some-
how it seems to me that today he is worse
than he has ever been

  she gazed moodily into the distance her
face reflecting her worried thoughts car-
ruthers was at a loss-he himself felt as if
he had known her for months instead of
days but he was afraid of presuming to try
to comfort her

  i cant understand why we ever came
here she said at length he was in
a bank in el paso and then after mother
died we came to ausman and he bought the
store it was a very small place then we
didnt know a soul here except daddy
george and he came with us

  like a flash the thought came to carruth-
ers that had come to tex at the first men-
tion of el paso it was almost a certainty
that mr weston had come to ausman at
the behest of dave fitzpatrick suddenly
unutterable pity welled up in the young
pilots heart for the girl so helpless to com-
bat the forces which must be slowly tearing
her father to pieces

  he dropped beside her on the lounge and
impulsively placed his hand over hers

  miss weston you havent known me-
us-long but believe me if there ever is any-
thing we can do for you-if we can help you

in any way at all-

  quick tears welled into her eyes and her
voice was unsteady

  thanks so much im sure you would
she said you cant imagine what a relief
it is just to talk to somebody about it
there isnt a soul in this miserable place to
whom i feel that i could even hint at any-
thing so personal

  she withdrew her hand slowly and dabbed
at her eyes

  by the way said carruthers have
you or your father heard from balavo i
understand he owns the big casino or what-
ever you call it in town

  oh yes he was in to see father and
wanted to pay for the little ford and every-
thing he wanted to see me too but i
cant stand him he tries to come to the
house quite often

  the flyers had told neither corinne nor
mr weston about their fracas with the
mexican or the reason for it and apparently
corinne had no idea that anything more
than the wreck itself had happened

  tex and mr weston came around the
corner of the house and carruthers got to
his feet he held out his hand and his
handsome face was very serious as he said
rapidly

  dont forget what i said miss weston-
and if we leave too soon im coming back
to ausman

  well were going to lose our charioteer
unless we hike came macdowells voice
were sure glad the invalid is progressing
so well the effects of the upper ozone on
the health are very salubrious apparently
corinne smiled and then became serious
as she returned macdowells regard

  ive not said much but i know just
what chances you must have taken for me
mr macdowell she said


adventure

  carruthers observed that tex showed in
his eyes that his interview with mr weston
had brought forth something that evidently
meant excitement ahead for they were liter-
ally blazing his light-hearted words bore
out the suspicion for he said

  they say i carried a valuable load into
san antone a while ago but i guess it was
a more valuable one i landed in ausman
it was the first time he had ever publicly
alluded to his public branding as a trafficker
in illicit goods and as the two flyers went
down the roadway toward the car corinnes
gaze followed tex steadily

  her father too was watching the two
army men and his eyes were the mirrors of
utter misery

xi

the little office in the rear of the
weston general store was full to
overflowing mr weston chewing
his finger nail as he slowly crumpled a cigar
to bits with the other hand sat at his desk
blackie stearns who had spent a day in
close confinement up-stairs was perched on
the safe vancouver b dale fat and per-
spiring representative of law and order for
the village of ausman completely hid the
straight-backed chair which seemed utterly
inadequate to hold him up

  beers the hard-faced cold-eyed ex-
cowboy whom tex had caused much misery
months before when the flyer had sent him
back to dave fitzpatrick minus two thou-
sand dollars of the smuggling monarchs
money occupied the remaining chair his
business suit made him look uncomfortable
and out-of-character

  outside the office in the dim shadows of
the store a vague figure could be seen rest-
ing comfortably on a pile of gaudy blankets
it was daddy george the patriarchal night
watchman

  well i wish old fitzpatrick would
hurry up remarked stearns the deep
wrinkle between his heavy brows as obvious
as always i sure would like to know
whats going to be pulled off

  his careless observation seemed almost to
shock the others dale and mr weston
glanced upward instinctively as if they were
afraid some one had overheard

  well ill gamble its going to be good
stated dale whose small eyes were mere
pin-points peering forth from folds of flesh

  youre - right agreed beers with

his thin-lipped smile

  lets not talk about it-lets not talk
about it grated the storekeeper leaping to
his feet as if his endurance was at an end

  he looked out into the store for a mo-
ment and then resumed his seat a fresh
cigar in his mouth

  why so worked up old socks inquired
stearns flippantly

  shut your fool mouth snapped beers

  stearns face went dark with passion but
his-retort was checked by the appearance of
daddy george in the doorway his long
white beard fell half-way to his waist a
battered old sombrero of huge dimensions
was set well back on his head 

  got a match jamey he asked of mr
weston a brown paper cigaret in his thin
hands

  plenty dad returned mr weston
with a forced smile and handed the old man
a boxful

  daddy george peered near-sightedly at
the other men in the room but apparently
could not recognize them in the dim light of
a flickering oil lamp for he did not speak to
either beers or dale he shuffled out into
the store again a revolver swinging well
back on his hip

  some night-watchman grinned stearns
who apparently had forgotten his wrath

  hes an old employee and friend of
mine-friend of mine answered mr wes-
ton just does him good to think hes
doing something

  oh he must be the old boy searles is
staying with isnt he queried stearns

  yeah hes the one got a little shack
out on the edge o town he thinks searles
is the king of the herd said beers

  does he know how searles makes his
livin asked stearns

  mr westons face twitched at the blunt
question and beers and dale flushed

  none o your business what he knows
no he dont know anything and let me
tell you mister-

  searles stepped quietly into the office
through the back door his boot-heels clump-
ing on the floor

  lets mosey he said and without
a word the four men followed him out the
door and up the outside steps that led to
the second story

  not a word was spoken as they filed in
through the cluttered little room with the
feuds end



rumpled cot where stearns had slept and
then into a narrow hallway searles opened
the first door and led the way into a large
room lighted by a big kerosene lamp

  dave fitzpatrick was seated in the fur-
ther corner partially in the shadow he
neither moved nor spoke as his visitors
filed in and took seats-three of them on
the bed and mr weston and searles on the
remaining chairs except searles every
man seemed constrained and ill at ease-
stearns flippancy had entirely disappeared
and dale could not have been more stiff and
self-effacing if he had been in the presence
of royalty

  from the fact that i am here you can
figure just how important this matter is
going to be began fitzpatrick without
preamble listen and dont make any
mistakes

  the level expressionless voice was as
flat and cold as always there was an
indefinable chill about the man-stearns
had the thought that if he should touch
fitzpatrick the very flesh would be cold
and clammy the smuggler was dressed
in a gray sack suit and soft shirt and his
arms were resting on the arms of his chair
the hands flat and motionless

  tomorrow afternoon a note will be
delivered to macdowell which will ask him
to meet your daughter weston out at the
shack behind your house at nine oclock
balavo is getting the note ready it will
be a creditable forgery and will be so
worded that it will keep macdowell out
until after ten the note will make it im-
perative that he make his way there with-
out being seen this will-

  my- mr fitzpatrick dont bring

my daughter into this exclaimed mr wes-
ton his gaunt face and unhealthly bright
eyes beseeching i--

  this will serve to keep macdowell out
of sight of everybody for two hours went
on fitzpatrick unemotionally

  not by so much as a glance of the narrow
unwinking eyes had he paid attention to the
distraught mr westons plea the mer-
chant sank back on the bed trembling as
though from ague as the stony voice went
on

  you weston will be working late at
your office and there will be a thousand
dollars in cash in the open safe you
stearns dressed in a pair of breeches and
puttees and a long raincoat wearing a mask

will come in the back door of the office and
hold weston up he will call the night-
watchman before you apparently choke him
probably the watchman will come running
and you apparently will not see him until
hes close weston youll fall on the floor
so the doddering old fool wont be afraid to
shoot searles will have put blank cart-
ridges into his gun-hes staying with him
as usual when hes here-and can do it
dale stearns beers and weston were
listening now as if the massive figure in the
chair had hypnotized them they were as
motionless as fitzpatrick himself all ex-
cept mr weston to whom it was a physical
impossibility to keep still searles his
bowed legs crossed comfortably smoked
and gazed tranquilly at the ceiling

  there will be little noise made and that
will be far from the street very few people
will be out anyway dale you will be near
by and get there immediately after stearns
has overpowered the watchman and left
the night watchman will give you a general
description youll pick up macdowell in
the hotel the thousand dollars will be hid
in his mattress smith the hotel-keeper
will do that he will not have an excuse-
if he speaks of the note it will have been
destroyed because the girl asked it and he
wont be able to produce it he wouldnt
think of not doing what she asked him to
he will not have any alibi on account of
sneaking away to answer the note and
going a roundabout way deliberately trying
to avoid being seen at the girls request
after the arrest he will be taken to the
county seat the watchman weston and
dale will appear as witnesses against him
and macdowell will be roped and hog-tied
but-but why on earth should you do
this to him mr fitzpatrick gulped the

agonized weston why-

  do you understand exactly what youre
to do weston returned fitzpatrick evenly

  but he-he almost saved my daughters
life wailed the store-keeper now totally
without control over himself mr fitz-
patrick i-i cant do it

  it was a hysterical burst of defiance
fitzpatrick his eyes snakelike and his voice
as void of emphasis or expression as ever
let his gaze dwell for a moment on the thin
twitching man before him

  you think so much of your daughter
that you will probably look forward to her
visits in jail then weston he said evenly


adventure

  dale licked his thick lips and stole a
glance at weston beers looked steadily at
the floor to both these men mr weston
had been a figure imposing and authorita-
tive a high-ranking lieutenant to the chief
the hint in fitzpatricks last words was a
surprize to them both searles smoked
quietly stearns had his bold black eyes
glued to fitzpatricks face

  but-but wont you tell me what you
have against him begged mr weston
i-god help me ill do it but-

  he caught a glance from fitzpatricks
eyes and his hoarse jerky words ceased
abruptly beers had told him of fitz-
patricks desire to frame macdowell but
did not know what the smuggler had against
him the relentless venom that permeated
fitzpatricks every word-the depth of cold
hatred and resolve that seemed to radiate
from the man-paralyzed the resistance of
mr weston who seemed like a bird strug-
gling futilely in a fowlers net

  stearns lit a cigaret with shaking fingers
that he strove to keep steady to him there
was an atmosphere of tension in the room
that affected him strangely the air seemed
filled with the sinister spirit of fitzpatrick
his influence appeared to be telepathic
without the aid of emphasis by word voice
or action the spirit of the man saturated
the consciousness of his henchmen

  now as to details resumed fitzpatrick
evenly and for an hour point by point and
man by man the group went over the frame-
up- 

  nothing was so trivial that the chief had
not provided for it the perfection of the
scheme was very clear to the slowest in-
tellect there macdowell without an alibi
because he had used every effort to avoid
being seen his only explanation of where
he had been a note that he could not produce
and of which the supposed writer knew
nothing the absolutely sincere although
vague testimony of the duped old night-
watchman backed by the definite perjury
of dale and weston the fact that not a
soul in ausman excepting those who were
in the project knew of stearns presence in
the town the nearsighted old watchman
would have no idea as to who he was-
probably could not even swear that dale
or beers whom he knew had been in mr
westons office when he had appeared for a
match

  finally everybody but searles left as

  the four men filed down the steps they took
deep breaths as though they had just freed
themselves from the influence of something
uncomfortable and depressing a personal
interview with fitzpatrick was an event
even to them - he realized the effectiveness
of keeping himself personally unknown to
all but a very few of his underlings he was an
impersonal much-dreaded force that was
ever in the background little known but
always apparent

  his last words were burned into their minds
as they separated at the foot of the steps

  remember the importance of what you
have to do-and who and what you are

  his cold contempt for them made them
wince but the inference while it meant
different things to the different men was
unpleasantly remindful to them all

xii

      no dad i aint aimin to leave
      until tomorrow searles replied to
      a question of the old mans

  the two were sitting in front of the
isolated little shack built of unpainted
boards chinked with clay that the old man
had occupied since he had accompanied his
patron mr weston to ausman it was
afternoon of the day set for the final sub-
jection of tex macdowell

  im glad of it jim boy returned the
old man with a little cackling laugh of
pleasure

  he sucked an old corncob contentedly as
he sat tilted back against the wall of the
shack in an old chair searles was squatting
on his heels hat tilted to keep the rays of the
westering sun from his eyes

  i sure am glad reiterated daddy george
at length outside o mr weston there
aint a man id rather talk to than you
jim sure does make a feller feel good to
have you stay with him once in a while
boy

  the boys wrinkled weatherbitten face
became even more creased with deep-cut
lines as he smiled one of his rare smiles
somehow the utter devotion of the old man
to mr weston whom he swore was the
nearest thing to an angel that ever walked
the earth always appealed to the tranquil
searles as having more than its share of
irony

  the old man glanced at searles his kind
old eyes full of affectionate regard
feuds end



  jim aint it been long enough since your
scrape in new mexico sos you could come
back and be a regular american agin he
asked at length shucks boy folks has
forgotten that in this part o the country-
years ago if they ever knew it i dun no
just what ye do for a livin jim but pears
like you ramble around an awful lot how
about it

  oh im gettin along fine dad re-
joined searles quietly

  inwardly he had been turning over in his
mind for some weeks a certain idea that was
gradually growing stronger perhaps the
steadily deepening conviction that the
slightest slip he made in carrying out fitz-
patricks orders would mean his ruin much
more surely than a complete break from his
chief had something to do with ii

  should he strike out for himself there was
a strong possibility that he would never
meet any one who would remember him
should he fail fitzpatrick that coldly
vindictive utterly pitiless man would cast
him aside like a broken piece of machinery
and see to it that the old scrape was revived
with evidence enough to freshen peoples
minds

  take weasel williams for instancy re-
flected searles except searles himself
he was the fastest man on the draw in the
border country he had served fitzpatrick
well in many a difficult nasty project he
didnt succeed in stealing the invention of
macdowell and sergeant cary at mc-
mullen and now fitzpatrick was seeing to
it that he would get more years in jail than
that particular crime warranted

  well i may settle down in the u s
some day dad but not right now he
stated at length when i get a little more
of a stake-

  youre the best judge boy i aint
tryin to butt in none interrupted the old
man quickly dont make no difference
to me except for your own sake

  i know-i know searles assured him

  it was a queer friendship between the
outlaw and the gentle old man daddy
george had once been desert rat miner
cowboy in the days of his long vanished
youth years before he had done a great
service to searles in el paso and from that
time on at intervals searles had made it a
point to drift in occasionally to the old
mans great delight he would often recall
with the pathetic pride of an old man the

  time he had picked up searles almost shot
to death in a dim side street of the line
in el paso and nursed him back to health
with the aid of aunt judy

  i wonder where davell go when he
finishes gettin this here flyer mused
searles that shore would suit me to the

ground -if i ainlt reached pretty near

the end o my rope dave is a wonder but
then i got so i dont enjoy havin him dig
me too much lord but think o what some
o these fellows like weston is gettin
daddy george broke in on the tenor of
his thoughts by remarking

  corinne sure looked purty as a picture
today her arm is mendin fine i wish
you knew her jim as fine a gal as ever
was in texas lord i remember when she

wasnt nothin but--

  i aint much of a hand with the women
dad drawled searles dryly not for
ten years back

  dont get remindin yourself o that
the old man interjected decisively his thin
face troubled

  oh i aint sensitive i understand them
two young aviators thats down here are
kind o shinin up to her

  i dunno mebbe they are im glad of it
if it is true the girl needs some up-
standin bright young fellers for company
there aint nobody in ausman shed look
at-there aint one of em fit to black her
boots in fact i shouldnt say there was
anybody that was come to think con-
siderin that jamey weston is her daddy
besides youve heard about how them
flyers brought her in in their airyplane
didnt you

  yes yes-i think you told me said
searies hastily

  somehow or other he didnt like to
think of young macdowell he remem-
bered vividly the picture of the tall pilot
his eyes flashing with the joy of combat
standing at that poker table in el paso
with drawn gun while his partner ransom
dragged in the money macdowcll had won
by outwitting beers and aldez the mexican

  searles himself had just been inducted
into the game to make the fourth player the
other two were responsible and he had
actually enjoyed the scene he had heard
much of roaring bill macdowell in the
old days his son was certainly not far
behind him

  thought id passed the diaper days but


adventure

-if im stuck on tonights job reflected

the outlaw its - foolish but im

plumb delighted that all ive got to do is
done and dont amount to much at that
he had changed the shells in dads gun
as it hung in the holster beside his bed that
morning while the old man slept there
were six blanks in the long-barreled six-
shooter now and likewise in its twin which
the old man kept hanging on the wall

tex carruthers and correll were
on their way home they were
walking tonight their young chauf-
feur was busy elsewhere for the first time

  the past three days had been unevent-
ful-disappointingly so-but full of hard
work for the airmen after getting the motor
fixed and running it for a few moments to
make sure it was all right they had spent
a solid half-day looking up a four-mule
team with which to drag the ship into the
field where tex and carruthers had landed
theirs

  then came the tedious work of rerigging
the completely loosened fuselage and wings
an airplane fuselage is a series of cubes
composed of four wooden longerons running
from nose to tail with cross-braces every
few inches on top and bottom and struts
running up and down crossed drift and
anti-drift wires are stretched between each
pair of corners of each cube

  to rerig the fuselage it was necessary to
get the ship in flying-position by means of
propping up the tail until a level on the top
longeron showed the bubble standing ex-
actly in the middle and then start at the
nose and work back to the tail pains-
takingly rigging each cube until it was
absolutely four-square this was done by
tightening and loosening wires

    should one of the sections be the least bit
out of line all the following ones would
pyramid the error in that case the warped
fuselage would result in loss of airspeed and
would help throw the wings out of line
many times the disgusted flyers fpund that
after carefully getting one panel lined the
lining of the next one would pull the pre-
ceding one out again it had been tedious
painfully accurate work with an insufficient
tool-kit and now at the end of three days it
was done although the wings still were un-
rigged this however was not so difficult
a job

   every day the two flyers had called on

corinne after work was over and for the
last two evenings carruthers had made
individual descents on the weston domicile
corinne almost forgot her unhappiness
under the influence of macdowells humor
and - carruthers open devotion she felt
as if she had allies now-and for two years
she had been alone as far as the companion-
ship of youth was concerned

   little by little the two flyers especially
carruthers heard from her lips the story
of the disintegration of james weston they
did not hint at what they conceived to be
the real reason for his unexplained move
from el paso to ausman and his change
from a happy contented man to one moody
nervous and irritable

   carruthers was made happy by the pres-
ence of corinne but for tex himself the
days had been disappointing not a ripple
disturbed the placid current of existence in
ausman mr weston had habitually
avoided the flyers since the day when with
the excuse of showing macdowell his
chickens he had begged him again to leave
ausman

rsa-l there was but one incident that
g  might be twisted to fit the theory
i that dave fitzpatrick was the power
behind the throne in ausman the incident
had happened the day before

   it was immediately after supper and tex
was walking past balavos place by him-
self the stout bejeweled mexican came
to the door as tex passed the flyer looked
at him a half-smile on his face he ex-
pected that balavo would show some signs
of rancor judging from his actions at their
first meeting

  however balavo hurried out to meet
macdowell shook hands effusively and
invited him to come in tex refused his
natural course of action would have been
to accept even if he had known that he was
putting himself in some danger but in
ausman he was a man of one idea balavo
had almost cringed in his efforts to square
himself for what he had done out at the
wreck and went out of his way to hint that
there were no hard feelings on his part about
the beating he had received and that there
would be no attempt at retaliation

  in macdowells mind there was the
thought that perhaps balavo had heard
his masters voice-that orders had gone
out to avoid any friction with the stranger
feuds end



until the big event took place it did not
seem natural some way for balavo to
change so completely from the vicious
wrath and murderous desire for revenge
he had shown four days before tex knew
mexicans and their outstanding trait was
not a tendency to forgive an injury in
addition balavo appeared to have both
means and power and was in a most ex-
cellent position to make things hot for tex
in ausman

  all these things were running through
macdowelps mind as the three airmen
walked slowly down the main street and
turned toward the hotel the walk had
been a silent one all three were tired and
hot

  i hardly feel like a trip up to westons
remarked tex as the three seated them-
selves on the edge of the veranda for a
moment before going in

  you might as well you know it means
a lot to corinne to have somebody come in
and sort of break the monotony replied
carruthers fanning himself with an old
newspaper that had been thrown on the
veranda floor

  mrs smith manager owner cook and
chambermaid of the hotel came out the
door with two letters in her hand

  some mail for you mr macdowell
she announced

  tex looked curiously to see who was
writing him at ausman

  one was from his father forwarded from
donovan field he ripped open the flap
and glanced through it quickly

  dads busy all right he told the others
after he had finished he says the rangers
the cavalry and all the customs men and
police along the border are getting busy as

- old bill trowbridge sheriff of hidal-

gq county is right in the van he helped
me out on getting weasel williams when
he stole that carbureter of carys and mine
you know theyve pulled a lot of thugs
already all along the border but so far no-
bodyll talk trowbridge has been trying
to get wind of who might have planted that
opium in our ship there was a strange
spig pretty well dressed that was around
mcmullen and was seen with a soldier just
before it happened but they cant find hair
nor hide of him theyre trying to spot the
soldier now

  well that isnt so bad correll re-
marked apparently your father is getting

more action then we are in spite o all our
big talk a few days ago

  tex was turning the other letter over in
his hand it was unstamped evidently
having been left at the hotel without going
through the post office it was addressed
in a womans handwriting

  oh ho-o-o gibed carruthers as he
caught sight of the writing on the plain
white linen envelope so in spite of all
your good advice to me youve been making
hav while the sun shone with some rural
beile have you breaking her heart with

your smart city-

  not so far as i know responded tex
i havent the least idea who this is from
he opened it as be spoke

  its your fatal beauty and your winning
ways tex

  tex did not respond his eyes were glued
to the note before him he read it with
swiftly mounting surprize

my dear lieutenant macdowell

  i have thought and thought before sending you
this but you are the only one i have to turn to in
this particular matter that is i feel that you are

  there is something that i simply must tell you
i am almost crazy with worry and fear of what
seems bound to happen unless by some means or
other it can be averted i know how strange and
silly it must seem to you for me to write all this
but i must ask some one for help

  will you please-please mr macdowell-meet
me for just a few moments at that little shack on
top of the hill directly behind our house i can
walk that far now i will tell the housekeeper that
i feel very badly and go to bed and lock the door
i can slip out easily try to keep mr carruthers
from coming tonight someway if he should airs
bird will tell him i am ill

  please destroy this note immediately and dont
let any one see you tonight as you come it would
be horribly embarrassing to me-perhaps worse
than that if a living soul should know it will
be dark by the time you start and by walking up
the gulf shore and then over no one will see you
if i am a little late please wait because i must see
you i am throwing myself on your good graces-
dont misjudge me and believe me when i say that
almost nothing wojuld tempt me to do this except
what has happened hastily

corinne weston

  ps if you get this before you come this after-
noon do not even hint anything about it i would
rather you wouldnt call this afternoon-let mr
carruthers come alone please do this i will
explain it all tonight	c w

  the note was closely written in a fine
precise handwriting the paper was plain
white linen of good quality tex read it
for the second time


adventure

  somehow or other that instinctive sense
of danger that is so much a part of outdoor
folk sounded a warning call had he not
been keyed up to a state of watchfulness
probably it would have never occurred to
him even to think of suspecting the genuine-
ness of the note had he been the sort of
man to whom girls make a special appeal
and had the thought of doing so lovely a
one as corinne weston a favor smacked of
romance he would have undoubtedly been
so pleasantly excited over the possibilities
ahead that nothing else would matter

  as it was the keen mind and hard com-
mon sense that were his heritage from his
hardy pioneer father began to get in their
work he was living in the expectation of
an opportunity to come to grips with the
enemy he felt was entrenched in ausman
and every person and incident within his
ken were examined suspiciously looking
at the note from that angle somehow or
other it did not ring true

  as he sat silently on the edge of the
veranda the two other men watching him
curiously his mind was working with
lightning-like speed searching out the pos-
sible bases for suspecting the note for
instance it would be natural for corinne
to call on carruthers if she really needed
aid of some kind

  why should she pick macdowell in pref-
erence to jack why should a mysterious
note be used when she would have every
opportunity that afternoon to speak to him
personally at least for long enough to in-
dicate what she wanted why should so
much secretiveness be emphasized when it
would not be any suspicious circumstance
to have him make an open call as he and
carruthers had been doing for several days

  jack come over here a minute ive
got something i want to talk to you about
excuse us correll

   carruthers followed him over to the edge
of the bank that fell away to the gulf
fifty feet below tex had decided to obey
the prompting of the inner sense that
warned him in the old days the mac-
dowell luck had been talked of throughout
texas when roaring bill was making win-
nings at poker that opened the eyes of men
even in those days of high play or cleaving
his way through obstacles that seemed insur-
mountable when rustlers and bad-men assist-
ed nature in making life a continual struggle

  but back of that luck was the audacious

spirit and fighting sense of the clan mac-
dowell luck was responsible perhaps for
the providential warning that had come to
tex before his passage at arms with fitz-
patrick in el paso but it was the timber
of the man that had accounted for his
coming away with two thousand dollars
which had been bled from his enemy right
now he was staking much on his instinct
that there was more to that note signed
corinne weston than appeared on the
surface

  jack listen to this

  tex read the note slowly aloud when
he had finished he raised his eyes to car-
ruthers flushed face

  you may think im a cad jack but i
have no prejudice against confiding in you-
even if i believed the note to be bona fide
carruthers looked up in surprize the
note had hurt him for he was very much in
love

  you mean you dont think its o k
he queried hopefully

  im inclined to think not i may be
too suspicious but listen

  one by one he gave his reasons

  now on the other side what would a
faked note do it would keep me out of
sight of everybody for two hours if fitz-
patrick is at work and is trying to frame me
it would very probably suit his convenience
perfectly to have me out of the way com-
pletely for two hours it may be to plant
something in my room at the hotel-almost
any crime could be fastened on me in this
town unless i had a bullet-proof alibi what
do you think

  carruthers did not answer for a moment
he had forgotten the pain he had felt when
tex had read the note-he was thinking
now of the possibly approaching climax that
tex had been looking forward to ever since
he had seen beers

  the more i think about it the more
reasonable it looks to me old man he said
finally and another reason that you
havent mentioned i dont believe corinne
would send a note quite like that

  neither do i--not to me anyhow now
heres my scheme it cant get you in
wrong-if the note is really straight it may
make me somewhat unpopular in the wes-
ton sector but thatll be my hard luck
you go up to call on her this afternoon and
mention the fact that you saw me reading a
note and just happened to see the signature
feuds end



which you thought was hers it can be in
sort of a kidding vein you know if the
note was straight shell be embarrassed
and show it-that girl couldnt deceive any-
body on a thing like that it will be easy
for you to find out i think i hate to ask
you jack but i believe things may be due
to break and im passing no bets

  the fine gray eyes were alight with ex-
pectation and determination as tex men-
tioned the thing he devoutly hoped would
happen it was not the careless reckless joy
in struggle for its own sake although that
was a part of it it was largely the fierce
satisfaction of a man who sees a chance to
fight his way out of a tight corner pitting
his strength against his enemys with a fight-
ing chance to win

  why ill be tickled to death to do it
tex and im started right now declared
carruthers

  he suited action to the words and de-
parted at a half-run for a short clean-up
in the hotel tex his mind full of the many
possible ramifications of his situation walk-
ed slowly back to where correll was still sit-
ting contentedly on the edge of the veranda

  sergeant theres just a chance that
things are due to break tonight i cant
tell you right now but when jack gets back
i can if my suspicions are correct it may
be a big night for the air service whether
it affects the status of the services only
opium smuggler or not

  i hope to -- youre right lieutenant
said the grizzled old army man

you know im jealous of tex
macdowell smiled carruthers

  he and corinne were seated on
the big comfortable lounge where corinne
spent most of the day

  why she asked i hear hes a won-
derful flyer but it seems to me his present
situation is far from an enviable one

  oh i know i wasnt thinking of that
you know that son-of-a-gun got a note from
some girl here in ausman today these
movie idols-

  some girl in ausman laughed corinne
surprizedly why i cant imagine who it
could be there arent more then eight or
ten girls here

  i just happened to glance over mac-
dowells way and saw the signature be-
sides stated carruthers with mock solem-
nity

  you didnt tell me who it was-
please i wont tell a soul i swear i wont

  her eyes were brimming with delighted
anticipation as she begged him to tell her
she was dressed in white today and the
color was commencing to return to her face
she was dangerously charming at that mo-
ment reflected carruthers with a sort of
half-frightened happiness flooding through
him

  it looked like corinne weston to me
he laughed hiding the bluntness of his words
behind his mirth

  oh thats mean she reproached him
here you get me all worked up about a
budding romance with one of the village
belles and its all a story or is it

  carruthers was now thoroughly satisfied
tense expectancy ran through him like fire
in the happiness of frequent calls on corinne
plus the hard work on the ship and the com-
plete lack of any activity on fitzpatricks
part during the past three days the young
flyer had almost forgotten about possible
complications with the smuggler now how-
ever the apparently sure indication that
things were due to break filled his thoughts

  he took a chance and rapidly told corinne
the story he did not mention her fathers
warning to tex or their suspicions of him
the girls face was flushed and her great
hazel eyes shadowed with indignation as she
heard of the note in her name this did not
prevent her from comprehending the bitter-
ness of the struggle between tex mac-
dowell and his enemy

  but what would fitzpatrick be doing
down here in this little town she asked
when carruthers finished

  fearful that she might grasp some con-
nection between her father and the power
that was menacing macdowell carruthers
strove to change the subject but without
success

  do you suppose it would be possible
that some one that was a-a little jealous
might have written that note to mr mac-
dowell so that they could get a good chance
to have a fight with him she asked red-
dening just a trifle as she met the flyers eye

  i dont think so besides anybody that
had any eyes could see that im the most
interested man around the weston house
returned carruthers boldly what ad-
mirers have you that you would suspect of
such a nefarious deed he went on with a
smile


adventure

  that greasy balayo is always trying to
get friendly and there is george dale she

returned absently but i dont think-

  no its fitzpatrick im sure said car-
ruthers decisively

  suddenly she caught her breath with a
little sob

 do-do you suppose my father could
be-

  she did not finish the connection be-
tween the letter signed with her name and
her fathers recently exaggerated peculiari-
ties came to her with paralyzing force
suddenly she knew the truth and her
shoulders shook with sobs before he knew
it carruthers arms were about her and he
was saying foolish things into her ear to
comfort her

  the storm was over in a moment and
as she gently freed herself from his embrace
she even tried to smile

  you are all wrong lied carruthers
it was a natural thing for them to do
they knew that tex and i had done you a
little favor and were here a great deal

  i-i hope so she returned as she gave
him her hand in farewell and you dont
know how im hoping and praying that all
your suspicions are wrong and that its just
some silly joke

  were not hoping so stated carruthers
turning for an instant at the top of the steps
mr westons car was approaching a quar-
ter of a mile down the road corinne tex
will be primed tonight to not only keep
clear of any entanglement but to get some-
thing on fitzpatrick himself if he can and
i hear that when macdowell gets into
action its pretty to watch by-by until
tomorrow

carruthers told tex his story
with blazing eyes and excited speech
the two flyers called correll and
told him all the details to that worthys
delighted astonishment

  now i believe the lay is this-ive been
oiling the old mental wheels as much as
theyll stand said tex his words more
softly deliberate than usual they want
me out of the way at nine oclock whether
completely out of town or just out of my
room and in a place where nobody can see
i dont know i suggest that correll stay
in my room with the light out and his gun
in case there should be any attempt at
planting stuff you and i carruthers will

sneak out to the supposed meeting-place at
the shack about eight oclock to see
whether anything is doing out there i
dont believe there is because so far foul
play has not been fitzpatricks game well
have the hotel-keepers son go along if
possible because your unsupported word
might not go far

   at nine oclock well start down-town

 it will be a-good thing to have a lot

 of people see us-on the outskirts of town

 i mean i believe there is going to be some
 fake crime pulled off

   he stopped speaking for a minute ap-
 parently deep in thought

   in case my hunch about a planted rob-
 bery or something is correct and in the
 event that our suspicions of mr wes-
 ton-

   now youre talking lieutenant correll
 interrupted eagerly

   maybe i said a mouthful and maybe
 not said tex with a grin but if i hit

  the bulls-eye i figure it might be a-

 good idea to see what brand that night-
 watchman carries if the event takes place
 at westons store the night - watchman
 would be fixed some way wouldnt he

   hed have to be agreed the excited
 carruthers

   well lets stray toward his shack and
 have a little converse with him correll
 suppose you look up our kid jitney-driver
 and fix it for him to go along with us if you
 can

   the two flyers came in sight of daddy
 georges shack in a few minutes two men
 were discernible sitting in front of it one
 of them disappeared while they were still
 too far away to have any idea what he
 looked like

   as they came closer and obtained a good
 view of the patriarchal old man tex re-
 marked in low tones

   he sure doesnt look the part of a thug
 does he

   more like the kind of a man youd call
 uncle agreed carruthers

   is this daddy george sir asked tex
 with a smile

   right son and youre them two air-
 planers that brought corinne weston in
 aint ye

   yes sir weve heard miss weston
 speak of you so much we thought wed drop
 in and talk a while with you said jack

   glad to have ye boys set down
feuds end



  returned the old man hospitably ill git
  another chair--

    dont do it interrupted tex ill
  just use the ground

   carruthers took the chair and tex
 squatted on his heels near the cabin wall
 they talked of several matters mostly of
 the westons and all the time tex was ap-
 praising his host unless he was utterly mis-
 led daddy george was incapable of taking
 in any underhanded double-crossing frame-
 up such as the flyers suspected in that
 event either the suspected crime was not to
 be committed at westons store or else the
 old man was to be an innocent party

    well boys i hate to hurry yuh but
  ive got to git on the job down to the store
  said daddy george at length ill walk a
  piece with yuh if youre goin back
  fine were due back for supper right
  now said tex as the three arose from
  their comfortable positions

   the night-watchman went inside and
 secured his holster with the big old-
 fashioned gun in it put on his huge bat-
 tered stetson and joined them

    the sight of the gun gave tex an idea
  somehow it seemed that unless all their
  carefully built up deductions were wrong
   there was something due to happen that
  night and westons store was the logical
  location for it from every angle he was
  certain that daddy george was not in-
  volved-the utter simplicity and sincere
  kindliness that were visible in his looks and
  actions were not assumed or else the old
  man would have been the most wonderful
  actor of the age if daddy george was to
  be a catspaw and that man who had left
  when they came in sight perhaps one of

  fitzpatricks men--

    we chased a visitor of yours away im
  afraid when we came in sight he said
  casually as they walked down the road

    oh no no the old-timer assured him-
  somewhat nervously tex thought just
  a friend of mine-he was goin anyhow

    as a matter of fact searles had left pre-
  cipitately with explicit instructions that
  under no circumstances was his name to be
  mentioned to the flyers the old man was
  familiar enough with searles to know that
  his visits to ausman were always incon-
  spicuous and it did not seem strange to
  him that searles had enjoined the strictest
  secrecy

    tex walked along silently for a minute

     

while carruthers kept the conversation
going if daddy george was a catspaw
perhaps the plotters would see to it that his
gun was unloaded to avoid taking any
chance it would be an easy matter for a
couple of men to bind and gag the night-
watchman without his getting a good look
at them he reflected it was worth in-
vestigating anyhow

  im sort of interested in that gun of
yours sir he said at length im more
or less of a nut on guns-brought up on a
ranch you know mind if i look at it
those big old-fashioned six-shooters arent
as common as they used to be

  you bet they aint ive had these guns
for thirty years or more-this here ones got
a twin back to the house

  he handed tex the gun the flyer
examined it casually

  mind if i take a shot at that old tin can
there just to see how she shoots he asked
with a smile

  go ahead lets see what kind of a
texan you be laughed daddy george

  tex cocked it and shot there was a
crack all right but no signs of a bullet
hitting the ground no dust was visible

  mustve been a blank said the sur-
prized daddy george thats funny try
another one

  five more were tried-all blanks

  by gorry thats sure a funny circum-
stance aint it queried daddy george
bet a cooky the manufacturer got some
blanks mixed in with the good shells mighty
careless business ill say spose some-
bodyd broke in the store some night and
me blazin away at em with blanks

  if i were you id write the manufacturer
it might mean the difference between life
and death some time ive seen one bad
shell in a lot but never so many

  as he returned the gun the flyers mind
was racing it was almost a sure thing
now-and he would be on the spot when the
cap was blown off

  well thanks for the company and the
information about the gun said daddy
george as they approached the store from
the rear they had walked across lots
during the last part of the trip to save time
ill git me some shells in the store and load
up agin

  good night sir see you again chor-
used the flyers

  jack that cinches it cold as a herring


adventure

tex said as they walked toward the hotel
those blanks were planted in daddy
georges gun of course that means he
isnt in it theyll just put him out of the
way and they put in the blanks to make
things sure if he should happen to get a
chance to shoot he wont get the chance
im sure theyll just wallop him with a
piece of wood or something or maybe bind
and gag him in the dark store so he cant
tell who they are-or maybe just one man
will do the job

  if he should get a chance to shoot-
hes an old-timer and therell probably
be one dead crook said tex grimly were
going to be right on the job around that
store jack-out of sight somewhere on the
outside we cant work too fast-remem-
ber its possible were all wrong if were
right weve got to be careful to keep clear
of the frame-up well be outside without
them knowing it ready to horn in at the
right time what say

  its the best way all right poor old
daddy george is in for some excitement
i guess

  maybe but we couldnt warn him you
see how he worships weston he wouldnt
believe it and remember were taking a lot
for granted however hes in no danger
im sure weston wouldnt have consented
to anything that would harm the old man
hell just be carefully put out of the way
back at the hotel correll reported that
he had had no luck in finding the boy-
that he would not be back from acacia
until late when the big non-com heard
what tex had to tell he nodded his face
alight

  weve got em i do believe he said
go to it lieutenant and - help any-
body that comes roving in the hotel to-
night

xiii

daddy george puttered
around in the shadows of the big
store covering it slowly from end
to end it was nearly nine oclock and only
the light that came through the open door
of the office illumined the long stretch of
floor space and counters the old watch-
man usually stayed in the office but tonight
mr weston was working late and so daddy
george spent his time out in the store to
avoid bothering him

the old man was immersed in contented

musing it was a source of great pride to
him to feel that he was worthy of a re-
sponsible position in his old age he had
served a good apprenticeship for taking
care of jamey westons property he
thought for the thousandth time he
patted the long-barrelled old-fashioned six-
shooter as he thought back to the days
when he had lived the life of the southwest
with all the abandon of hearty careless
youth he had relcfeded his gun upon en-
tering the store

  the old man was dozing off on a pile of
blankets when the tall masked figure of
blackie stearns slipped in the back door of
the office mr weston his face gaunt and
haggard started as nervously as if the visit
was not expected stearns had a drawn gun
in his hand for effect he was swathed
in a long coat but puttees could be glimpsed
beneath it

  daddy george screamed mr weston
just as stearns took hold of him and like
a flash the old man awoke in time to see
stearns throw the apparently lifeless body
of the storekeeper to the floor

  everything was dim to the nearsighted
night-watchman but he could make things
out vaguely as he started for the office
his pace slow perforce but his spirit 
unafraid

  stearns abstracted the thousand dollars
from the safe during the few seconds which
it took daddy george to get to the office
door the night-watchman was glad of the
fortunate chance through which he had
found out about the blanks and reloaded

  the old man panting hard got to the of-
fice door as stearns was apparently trying to
get out the door the watchman his hand
trembling pulled the trigger a searing
iron seemed to be pressed for an instant
against stearns arm

  the murderer of bogie bill saw red the
pain the flash-like thought that darted
into his mind of a double-cross the stag-
gering surprize of his wound all contributed
to the swift uprush of ungovernable rage
that made his sullen face terrible in its fury
in an instant he had shot daddy george
through the heart

  the old man lay in the flickering lamp
light the gushing blood staining the end
of his long white beard

  mr weston who had been lying on the
floor as was his part leaped to his feet
as the last shot reverberated through the
feuds end



room with a hysterical cry that was like
some wild beasts he leaped for his desk
drawer where he kept his own gun he
never reached it stearns dropped him with
a shot through the back

  swiftly as it had come the murderous
rage was past but once again the die was
cast for blackie stearns an explanation
would do no good-it was time to blow
reflected stearns with pounding heart but
curiously cool mind he shuddered as
though with a chill as he thought of the
cold massive chief upstairs like a shadow
he slipped out the door the thousand dollars
still in his pocket in one hand he clutched
the air service insignia that had been filched
from macdowells room and which stearns
had been planning to drop in the store office

  he had no sooner left and faded into the
shadows in the back than tex macdowell
and carruthers burst into the office they
had been hidden underneath the loading
platform the pistol cracks had not sound-
ed loudly on the outside and had come so
fast that the whole thing was over before
they could reach the office stearns had
not been a second too soon

    - the watchman and mr weston
breathed carruthers skrinking instinctively
from the horrible sight the office presented

  tex dropped quickly beside mr weston
the merchants eyes opened and the twitch-
ing lips smiled

what happened mr weston de-
manded tex how badly are you hurt
through the back and its bad
breathed mr weston is-is daddy

george-

  hes dead mr weston carruthers
told him gently and im going for a
doctor right now

  he bolted out leaving tex to support
the gray head of the storekeeper in his arms
he staunched the flow of blood as best he
could with a handkerchief held tightly to
the wound

  areyou too weak to tell me what hap-
pened asked tex eagerly we-

  the door burst open and the fat form of
vancouver b dale entered the office as
the marshall took in the tableau his heavy
flushed face went gray and he shrank away
with stark fear and horror showing in every
lineament of his face

 my-my- he whispered

  the game is up van mr weston told
him

  the thin lined face seemed more peace-
ful now and the sunken eyes were not so
feverishly bright as they rested on the
body of daddy george there was an instant
when they seemed to flash with bitter
wrath the white-bearded old man had
given his life to the patron who was so
unworthy of his devotion mr westons
eyes sought macdowells face perhaps it
was yet possible to atone somewhat

  as soon as the doctor comes and gives
me a hypodermic or something there are
many things i want to tell you boy he
said gently and the sunken eyes roved to
dales pasty face

  dale who was literally paralyzed at the
unexpected trend of events came to life
with a snap

  no no mr weston you cant be
going to-

  im going to tell macdowell everything
i know stated the weakening weston with
unmistakable solemnity hadnt you bet-
ter get out after stearns dale you
neednt be afraid-therell be just two
names in the confession-fitzpatricks and
mine oh yes and stearns

  without a word dale left tex held mr
weston stanching the wound as best he
could his mind awhirl with the possible
consequences of that night evidently
there had been some hitch in arrangements
resulting in the death of innocent old daddy
george and probably of mr weston the
wound was very bad

  the sound of a motor was heard outside
and ina moment the doctor came hurrying
in a glance at daddy george told him the
truth and it only took a short examination
of mr westons wound to make him shake
his head sadly his hard face softening a
trifle as he said simply-

  about half an hour jim

  i-im glad whispered mr weston
can you give me strychnine or something
so i can talk a little louder

 the doctor nodded and prepared a
hypodermic

  im going to dictate something to you
lieutenant macdowell and sign it you
and the doctor can witness it we must
hurry youll find paper and pencil on the
desk

  before beginning to write tex got some
blankets from the store with one he
covered the peaceful face of daddy george
and with the others he made mr weston


adventure

a little more comfortable then he began
to write at the wounded mans dictation
he had just started when the door opened
and corinne with carruthers supporting
her entered and threw herself on her knees
beside her father who smiled faintly as he
looked up into her eyes

  she did not burst into a storm of weeping
her drawn face and the pitiful look in her
eyes gave quiet evidence of her grief ap-
parently carruthers had told her what had
happened for she made no attempt to talk
to him

  after the hypodermic had been injected
and the wound bandaged by the quiet
doctor mr weston started to talk carru-
thers knelt on the other side of the wounded
man and the doctor leaned against the safe
tex sat at the desk to write down mr
westons words no one there saw searles
as he stood outside the window for a mo-
ment and watched the tableau shadowed
eerily by the dim oil lamp his eyes rested
longest on the motionless body of daddy
george in a moment he vanished again
seeking dave fitzpatrick

  dont write this mr macdowell said
mr weston slowly as if he was picking his
words very carefully for years i have
lived when it would have been more merciful
could i have died i am going to try to
atone a little now-god knows how hard
it is going to be to tell the story with you
here daughter

  he smiled faintly as he looked up into
her eyes her gaze did not falter nd her
hand continued to stroke his hot brow
slowly

  i got into the power of dave fitzpatrick
when my wife became very ill and i went
in debt i took some money from the bank
to speculate with i lost as usual and was
facing sure conviction as an embezzler im-
mediately after ruth died when fitz-
patrick made good the shortage but forced
me to sign a confession which he still holds
the details of the story are too long and
various for my strength but suffice it to
say that i am in ausman-i am what i
am-because of the events that started with
that moment when i stole money to try
and save the life of my wife

  he stopped a moment a faraway look
in his sunken eyes

  i am going to bare all i know of the man
who has dragged me down-held me in
iron bands until i am a broken thing that

has no right to be called a man now you
can begin to write lieutenant

  line by line macdowells pen traveled
over the paper and the story it wrote held
few surprizes for either carruthers or tex
macdowells deductions had been close to
the truth it told of mr westons position
as local representative for dave fitzpatrick
the town was practically owned by him-
most of the original inhabitants had been
bought out or forced out the mexicans
had been imported and cultivated fields
that were fitzpatricks they were com-
pelled to do their trading at the so-called
weston store and in addition the women
made baskets strings of beads and various
sorts of mexican curios which the store
shipped to various dealers in different parts
of the country with every shipment went
thousands of dollars worth of opium mor-
phine heroin and other drugs smuggled
into ausman from a small vessel which
fitzpatrick owned it plied out of various
ports in mexico and the contraband was
transferred to launches out in the gulf
each curio dealer was a fitzpatrick agent

  by every conceivable means the drugs
were carried out of ausman to points of
distribution in personal suitcases and
trunks in automobiles even by express
and freight packed in shipments from the
store the stuff was spread over the country
the curio camouflage was the best of
course because the most extensive so
large had the business grown that there were
plans under way to start a small factory
wherein blankets baskets headdresses
shawls mantillas and other articles would
be made systematically and the output
provide a legitimate excuse for large and
frequent shipments which would be the
channels for the largest dealing in drugs
the united states ever knew

  mr weston did not mention names
aside from fitzpatricks but it was easy
to see from the inferences of his halting tale
that the law the business the very spirit
of the town was dave fitzpatrick with
the exception of a very few people whose
eyes remained tight shut to what was going
on about them every white person in the
town was in some way or other under fitz-
patricks power one by one the few people
who had originally settled in ausman had
been driven out by fair means or foul-a
few of them had disappeared completely

  year by year the project had grown and
feuds end



from its inception mr weston had been the
business head of it representing fitzpatrick
never for a moment had he forgotten the
baleful influence under which he lived and
steadily he had gone deeper into the morass
as fitzpatricks hand had pushed him down
the climax was right there in his office with
daddy george lying dead beside him he
himself approaching death and his daughter
listening to the tale of his utter unworthiness
from his own lips

  he was perceptibly weakening as he
raised his eyes to tex quietly writing at the
desk

   boy there is-is so little i can say ex-
cept this that i pray may help you i have
told you the story of the plot that was
hatched against you by the man who is
sitting upstairs now

  tex started and carruthers went white
then tex resumed his position facing the
desk as he asked gently-

   is there any more sir

  yes if it will help you any i hereby
state that i know that fitzpatrick is your
enemy and that in el paso months ago he
tried to get you in his power and again here
he tried to ruin you i know almost nothing
of fitzpatricks operations outside of aus-
man-perhaps you yourselves know more
than i but it is my firm belief that if you
yourself or the man with you did not know
that the opium was in your ship when you
became notorious a few weeks ago after
it was found that fitzpatrick is at the
bottom of it i base my ideas from the
words of men i know are his henchmen and
know more than i god knows i would
have no reason-no reason-

   he could not finish the doctor injected
another hypodermic

  quick let me sign it demanded the
fast sinking man and with the last of his
strength he wrote a bold james weston
at the bottom of the last sheet

  carruthers held him up while he watched
the doctor and tex witness it and then the
doctor held him while carruthers added his
signature

   he was just finishing it when a great sob
came from corinne mr weston was dead

  take miss corinne away jack tex
said gently

   he turned to the doctor

  leave everything to me lieutenant
the doctor said

  he looked around quickly and then

leaned over until his mouth was close to
macdowelps ear

  ive lived in this town for ten years
and thought i knew something about it
but so help me im astounded sir as-
tounded

  macdowell wondered just how much sur-
prized the medico was

  ill leave it to you then he said de-
liberately ive got some business up-
stairs

  his army colt was in his belt he walked
to the door unhurriedly the doctor
watched him in amazement as he disap-
peared into the darkness he got a mo-
mentary impression of a cleancut face and
well-shaped head outlined sharply against
the night as tex inched the door shut from
the outside

  the professional man drew a deep breath
he would not have gone upstairs for any
reward he could think of right then

xiv

-mwr as searles slowly ascended the
-glfr stairs after his brief look at the
t i tableau in the office there was but
one thought in his mind he had come
down at fitzpatricks behest to find out
whether matters were progressing satis-
factorily he had seldom been as com-
pletely dumfounded as when he looked in
the window and saw weston and daddy
george on the floor the two flyers in the
office with them

  how matters had gone wrong did not
interest him now but the picture of the
whitebearded old man his thin worn face
peaceful in death affected the outlaw
strangely the gentle old fellow had been
the one touch of friendship in a lonely life
for many years and searles had not realized
just how important a factor in his life the
occasional peaceful visits to the old-timer
had come to be

  he opened the door of fitzpatricks room
but did not enter he leaned against the
door-jamb and slowly rolled a cigaret fitz-
patrick his massive figure sunk in a big
chair waited for him to speak

  well dave macdowells slipped you
again i reckon searles said finally strik-
ing a match as he spoke

  fitzpatrick did not move nor speak not
by so much as the winking of an eye did he
manifest surprize or chagrin


adventure

  the night-watchman is laying down in
the office dead weston is badly hurt
hell kick off in a few minutes probably
his daughter them two flyers and the
doctor is down there with em

  fitzpatricks light gray eyes did not
change expression and yet the cold all-
pervading wrath of the man seemed to
charge the air of the room he was terrible
in his repression

  the tranquil searles inhaled a deep draft
of smoke and blew it out slowly his puck-
ered eyes rested on fitzpatricks face he
was not at all uncomfortable now-he felt
suddenly as if he were freed of a burden
although he knew that never in ten years
had the motionless man before him been as
dangerous as he was then

  what went wrong asked fitzpatrick

  his voice ended flatly at the last word
it was more like a statement than a ques-
tion

  searles shrugged his shoulders

  stearns must have lost his temper or
something-i dunno how the flyers come
to be there instead o macdowell bein up
to the shack i likewise cant figure guess
you got a little sympathy for the men that
tried to get macdowell before aint you
beers and weasel-

  dont talk so much searles you-

  im aimin to talk a mouthful now
dave im quitting-tonight

  there was an interval of a full minute
after searles made his casual announcement
it was a battle of eyes and wills fitz-
patricks unwinking gaze did not make
searles eyes waver nor did the uncanny
force of his chiefs will affect him at all

  you are forgetting searles said fitz-
patrick evently

  im not forgetting a-thing searles

contradicted do your -est dave

this fool bug you got to get an upstandin
youngster like macdowell never did set
well with me-he never done nothin to you
and when i saw old daddy george layin
down there on the floor i made up my mind
i was through dirtyin up my hands with
your brand o crookedness any more
sabe

  all right searles and you know too
much to be surprized at anything that
happens

  the depth of hate and venomous determi-
nation that somehow was apparent in the
colorless words did not surprize searles nor

did it affect him he answered as quietly
as his former chief had spoken

  anything that figures to happen to me
had better come shootin dave he stated
and his eyes spoke volumes and just let
me rise to announce this-that if i figure
im gonna get caught im just as willin to
get hung for a sheep as a lamb so if you
aim to work on me work faster than my
guns

  there was another interval of silence
during which searles smoked while he
watched fitzpatrick imperturbably fi-
nally he threw away his cigaret butt and
straightened up

  well im blowin dave so long
i aint much on killin innocent old men-
never was and by the way if what i saw
down-stairs aint misleadin as - wes-
ton is tellin everything he knows youre
liable to be findin that macdowells got
something on you

  fitzpatricks eyes a certain snakelike
quality in them watched the short bow-
legged figure of his right-hand man dis-
appear down the hall if the tumbling down
of his house of cards in ausman affected
him a physical outlet for his wrath seemed
unnecessary for he remained as motion-
less as always in his big chair his eyes
resting on the blank wall in front of him
without a flicker of expression in them
tex macdowell creeping quietly down the
hall found him thus as he appeared sudden-
ly in the open doorway some clothes line
in one hand

  good evening mr fitzpatrick greet-
ed the pilot his broad shoulders almost
filling the doorway

  fitzpatrick did not answer he must
have known instantly who tex was but if
he was surprized he gave no sign the two
men who had been waging warfare against
each other for months met for the first
time face to face

  im here on a very salubrious errand
tex went on i cant forbear saying a few
things of a personal nature right at the
start of my call youll pardon me if i get
personal wont you

  the flyers speech was slow his attitude
almost lazy but the fire that showed
through in his eyes was the fierce joy of
battle against the enemy he had come to
hate with a hatred that was the cumulation
of months his passages-at-arms with
fitzpatrick had been like a game of wits
feuds end



at first-a game that he enjoyed with the
reckless delight of the macdowells in
pitting themselves against odds for the pure
satisfaction of the struggle lately he had
come to appreciate the relentless enmity
utter lack of scruple and far-reaching power
of fitzpatrick the two dead men down in
the office- tex could barely hold himself
back from leaping at the stony bulk in the
chair although his outward air of careless-
ness did not betray his feelings

  apparently you arent feeling conversa-
tional this evening the pilot went on
slowly so before i tie you up-did i for-
get to tell you i was going to tie you up
-i just wanted to say that of all the mur-
dering double-crossing utterly contempti-
ble coyotes i ever met youre the worst
id give a years pay to lick you with my
bare hands and have dad looking on

  there was something deadly in his words
and fitzpatrick seemed a statue of incarnate
venom perhaps he had come to hate the
son as he had the father-perhaps merely
because he was the son of his father

  now were going to tie you up and lead
you away and keep you safe until mr wes-
tons confession gets into the proper hands
drawled tex having paid you my com-
pliments lets go

  he had just started for fitzpatrick when
the smuggler got into action as if shot
from a gun the bulky body leaped from the
chair and fitzpatrick hurled himself at the
flyer tex had no chance to pull his gun-
would not have done so if he could he
welcomed the opportunity for physical con-
flict with a mirthless smile and blazing eyes

  he met fitzpatricks rush with a straight
left that numbed his hand but it did not
seem to affect his opponent perhaps be-
cause it was his only chance to escape per-
haps because of the terrible anger that filled
him as the ruin of all his plans loomed be-
fore him fitzpatrick seemed to possess
maniacal strength and endurance the
bulky body was as made of stone as far as
the effect of macdowells blows were con-
cerned

  tex fought coolly his back to the door
he had the longer reach but his blows did
not make his enemy falter in a few seconds
fitzpatrick succeeded in getting to close
quarters in a bearlike hug his two great
arms met around macdowells body

  with awful strength the arms kept closing
tighter about tex and little by little fitz-

patrick forced him to bend backward the
smugglers eyes were expressionless his big
square face a mask it was like being in the
folds of a boa constrictor

  beads of sweat came out on macdowells
face as with all his strength he fought the
relentless pressure that was forcing him
farther and farther backward until the pain
was horrible it could last but a few
more seconds tex his breath coming in
gasps gathered himself for a last effort
with his hands he exerted all the pressure
he could against fitzpatricks body

  it was not much for his arms were bound
tightly to his side by fitzpatricks grip as
he did so he strove to bend sidewise all
the reserve force in his big body went into
the torturing effort the veins in his fore-
head stood out like welts but inch by inch
he succeeded in bending his opponent with
him to the right finally both men fell
fitzpatricks grip loosened a trifle as his
wrist took most of the force of the fall in
a flash tex got loose and was on his feet

  fitzpatrick was after him his big form
moving with the speed of a panther he
aimed a terrible blow at macdowell-a
right swing tex used an old trick he had
learned in his college gymnasium quick
as a cat he bent from the waist under the
blow as he did so his left foot went for-
ward and with all the force of his body be-
hind it his right hand sunk in fitzpatricks
stomach

  it seemed as if that blow should have
finished him it did weaken him-for a sec-
ond or two he staggered macdowells gun
clanged to the floor it had hopped out of
his belt as he bent downward

  it bounced under the table and fitz-
patrick was after it in an instant he was
not quite quick enough even as his hand
was closing on it macdowells foot caught
his wrist and the gun went spinning to the
wall

  fitzpatrick got to his feet to be met with
a straight smash that knocked him down
once more as he got up he put one hand
on the back of a chair as if to help himself
without warning he swung the chair so
quickly that a leg grazed macdowells cheek
as he leaped back it left a red line across
one side of his face

  fitzpatrick went off balance by the force
of his swing and macdowell rushed in with
a vicious one-two with left and right that
sent his opponent staggering to the wall


adventure

  it was uncanny the way the man kept his
feet he had scarcely touched macdowell
except for the horrible moment when he had
succeeded in getting his grip and bending
him backward but the long-armed tex had
landed a dozen blows on fitzpatrick that
carried with them all the force of his superb
body and yet the outlaw kept on

  he rushed again and once more tex suc-
ceeded in landing a stomach blow it weak-
ened fitzpatrick perceptibly for a half-
minute he fought weakly weathering a
storm of blows to the face that left it crim-
son with blood and still with terrible per-
sistence and endurance he bored in striving
to obtain a body grip once more

  finally tex got his chance he sent fitz-
patrick against the table with a blow under
the ear and for a moment the smuggler
hung there the lamp swaying perilously
tex put the last of his ebbing strength into
two more blows to the stomach and fitz-
patrick sunk to the floor limply

  the flyer staggered against the table his
breath coming in great gasps he steadied
himself for a moment and then slowly got
the rope which he had dropped by the door
and tied fitzpatricks hands and feet the
narrowed opaque eyes were open but the
great body was momentarily paralyzed
tex used his handkerchief to wipe the blood
from his enemys face this done he got to
his feet and buttoned his o d shirt which
had been ripped open in the melee he
looked down at fitzpatrick

  youre a poor benighted heathen but
a first-class fighting man he quoted

  he picked up his colt and went out he
was bound for the street to find -vancouver
b dale he wondered whether they had
succeeded in apprehending stearns some-
how or other he did not have much confi-
dence in the professional ability of the aus-
man sleuth

  on the stairs he saw the doctor that
gentleman was standing on the bottom
platform apparently he had been on his
way for help to dispose of the bodies within
and had stopped to listen to the noise from
above

  had a little scrap tex told him as he
passed

  the street was quiet and dark only
the tiny dirty mexican restaurant showed
a light in its windows inside there were
at least fifteen men a few of them mexicans
talking excitedly evidently every one

was familiar with the principal events of
the evening

  further on sounds of excited discussion
reached macdowells ears from within
balavos place tex obeying a sudden
impulse tried the doors in front they
opened and he walked in

  there were twenty or more men in the
barroom a couple of mexican girls stood
in the doorway that led into the big room
in the rear vancouver b dale was among
the men all of whom appeared to have been
drinking silence fell suddenly as the tall
army man appeared his thick brown hair
in crazy disorder

  did you get stearns he demanded of
dale

  not yet theres three posses out look-
ing for him stammered dale

  youre a-of a marshall stated the

flyer without heat his hands stuck negli-
gently in his back pockets come on out
will you ive got a little job for you

  i was getting another posse in here
dale said apologetically

  the events of the evening had made him
uncertain of his position-extremely un-
certain he followed tex out like a lamb

  ive got dave fitzpatrick roped and
hog-tied and i want him put in the lock-up
do you understand

  they were walking along the street
toward the store the marshal stopped
dead in his tracks as macdowells words
sunk into his brain

  put him in the lock-up he gulped his
voice ludicrously cracked

  right returned tex

 i-i-

  i dont know just where you stand
dale but i dont believe youre precisely
sitting on top of the world in this deal
tex said slowly his eyes on the marshals
face if you want to do as much for your-
self as you can youd better do as i say

  the shot went home without a word
they started once more for the store

  oh tex came carruthers voice from
down the street

  jack came running down from the corner

  have they got stearns he asked
eagerly

  no-the demon policeman here hasnt
sleuthed him out yet returned tex

  anything happened since i left

  considerable answered tex well
let old fitzpatrick lay for a while and think
feuds end



it over seat yourselves on yon platform
gents and lets have a smoke

  dale refused a cigaret but carruthers and
macdowell lit up tex told the story of
his interview with fitzpatrick briefly to
carruthers vast delight and dales un-
affected horror

  and to think i missed it mourned
carruthers

  you sure missed a show my back is
still sore where he threw about half the
vertebrae out of joint ill be having one
of those chiropractors jumping on it ill
bet before she gets lined up again how is
miss weston

  pretty bad tex that housekeeper of
theirs seems to be a pretty good scout
though i left corinne with her

  i wonder if shes got any relatives or
anybody to live with

  not a one the housekeeper told me
carruthers did not say so but he had
plans along that line himself

  well lets get fitzpatrick incarcerated
tex suggested throwing away his half-
smoked cigaret

  you mean jail asked carruthers
the very same i was just trying to
fool sherlock holmes here

  dale smiled a sickly smile tex led the
way up-stairs and into the room where
fitzpatrick bound securely was stretched
flat on the floor dale was ludicrously ill
at ease his eyes refused to meet the stony
gaze of the man who had been the law and
the prophets to him for years

  tex inspected the fussed officer of the law
with a grin on his face

  constabule im not so darn confident
someway in the honesty of your intentions
in fact i am frankly scared stiff that your
natural kindness of heart may hamper you
in your official duties im going to over-
throw the law this once and put a guard of
my own around the jailhouse what do
you think jack

  good idea agreed jack

  now listen here blustered dale you

cant-

  i know we cant but were going to
sabe brother

  dales eyes fell before the level regard of
the tall flyer whose purpose was very
apparent beneath the gentle drawl the
marshals world was topsyturvy that night
his chief a bound prisoner weston dead
a confession from weston that included he

did not know how much-and the inherent
weakness of the man capitulated to mac-
dowell

  tex untied fitzpatricks feet and helped
him up he drew his colt and spun it in
his hand

  now fitzpatrick just a little word
naturally what you have tried to do to me
hasnt caused me to consider you any
friend of mine so walk just where and how
i tell you to or ill shoot you like the rattle-
snake you are

  no one could have looked at tex and
doubted his sincerity fitzpatrick walked
slowly out the door tex walked behind
him down the hall dale and carruthers
bringing up the rear

  when they got down to the street tex
turned to dale

  lead the way to your hoosegow dale
he said

  dale led them to a small building behind
the mexican restaurant the windows
were barred and the interior contained two
cells a hallway in front of them containing
a table and a chair each cell had a cot and
two blankets dale after lighting a small
kerosene lamp opened one cell as soon as
the barred door swung open he shrank
back against the wall as if mortally afraid
to get near the bound fitzpatrick

  the smuggler walked in slowly tex
himself loosened his hands and clanged
the door shut fitzpatrick sat down on the
bed his burly form assumed its wonted
position hands resting motionless on his
knees his eyes followed macdowell con-
tinually carruthers watched him with
curious repulsion he shivered at the
quiescent venom and menace that seemed
to compose the aura of dave fitzpatrick

  after the marshal had locked the cell door
tex held out his hand

  mind giving me the key dale he in-
quired softly

  yes i do stated dale stealing a quick
look at fitzpatrick for approval what
right have you-

  none probably returned tex easily
but hfres what youre going to do if
carruthers dont mind hell go up and get
a hard-boiled sergeant that has been waiting
for possible happenings up in my room at
the hotel then youre going to swear that
sergeant in as one of your assistants depu-
ties posse-members or whatever you call
em in fact hes going to be your chief


adventure

assistant and hes going to take charge of
the keys and this prisoner probably it
isnt strictly legal but this town and this
night arent what you might call examples
of legal procedure

  ill run down after correll now said
carruthers and departed on his errand

  sheriff i shouldnt be surprized if you
rather hope that stearns dont get caught
how about it

  wh-what do you mean stammered
the marshal his eyes once more stealing
toward fitzpatrick

  the ghost of an unpleasant smile twisted
the wide thin gash that was fitzpatricks
mouth

  well of course mr westons confession
so to speak didnt include you but it doesnt
take many elaborate mental processes to
connect you up with fitzpatricks opera-
tions in ausman tex answered judicially
thoroughness appears to be one of your
prisoners chief assets in his business

  the sheriff was squirming like an eel he
didnt know just where he stood with the
soft-spoken pilot who was so surprizingly
delegating to himself much authority

  now if stearns should be caught he 
might talk and if he talked you might be
in an-er-embarrassing position eh sher-
lock proceeded tex mercilessly

  dales fleshy gross face was beaded with
sweat and he licked his thick lips with
a tongue that was almost as dry as they
were

  however maybe i can persuade you to
rout out the telegraph operator and send
wires to the county sheriff and the chiefs
of police in victoria corpus christi and
some other near-by points stearns wont
have a chance to get away by railroad and
i doubt whether he knows enough about
boats to risk them-he wouldnt have gone
through the center of town anyway having
lost the protection of his benefactor here
tex looked at fitzpatrick as he finished
speaking meeting the stony glare of his
enemy imperturbably

  fitzpatrick a man licked in a square
fight deserves only respect and sympathy
but so help me if theres any varieties of
ways to rub it in that i dont find for your
special benefit tell me about it

  footsteps came to the ears of the three
waiting men and in a moment carruthers
entered with corrells huge form looming
up behind him the grizzled sergeants face

wore a smile that split it from ear to ear as
he surveyed fitzpatrick leisurely

  well well old scout how does she feel
he chuckled lieutenant it must a been
a large evening for you

  sizeable correll sizeable grinned tex
did carruthers tell you that you were
going to be a deputy marshal or whatever
they call the town policeman for the
night

  he did im breakin in on a good pris-
oner too returned correll

  all kidding aside though you may be
a little up against it at that i dont know
just how the men that have been working
for this double-cross artist here feel toward
him i imagine that they havent any per-
sonal affection for him and that most of
them will be tickled to death to see him out
of the way but theres just a chance that
there may be a rescue party formed ill be
back here as soon as the constable and i
send off a few wires about this stearns and
a few more to dad and the texas rangers
and a few more places two guns may be
better than one

  well be ready stated correll

  no reason why i cant hang around is
there inquired jack

  none at all thought you might be
a little tired i believe ill leave westons
last statement with you jack some one
might take a notion to roll me for it even
under the protection of the law

  he handed jack the closely written pages
that constituted a fragmentary but con-
vincing tale of fitzpatricks ten-year con-
quest of ausman

  does that confession give fitzpatrick

- lieutenant asked the sergeant

eagerly

  fitzpatrick himself deigned to turn his
head a trifle and look at tex as he answered
slowly

  enough its plenty to rope and hog-
tie him as far as thats concerned i guess
all weston knew we know now and itll be
a good start for more jack told you about
the frame they had ready and waiting for
me to step into didnt he

  correll nodded his face dark and forbid-
ding as he looked at fitzpatrick

  im liable to remember it if theres any
funny work too he said his eyes boring
into the opaque ones that refused to allow
a glimmer of expression to show in them

  im somewhat hazy as i said before
feuds end



about the propriety of the air service be-
coming the law in ausman but swear him
in sherlock said tex

  for a moment it seemed as if dale was
about to balk again it did not take him
long to decide that the odds were all against
him however and in a moment sergeant
correll was a full-fledged deputy and a
statement in writing to that effect signed
with a shaky vancouver b dale peace
officer ausman texas was in his hands
to back up his claim should any one doubt
his authority

  ill be back after the police force and
i send some telegrams tex said as he
opened the door

  dale followed him out slowly an hour
sufficed to rout out the maiden lady who
acted as ticket agent and telegraph operator
for ausman convince her of the importance
of the occasion and despatch many mes-
sages after lending his official presence to
this laudable though unpleasant duty
dale departed thankfully it may be
added that he departed with a completeness
that was almost astounding in an officer of
the law with an important criminal at large
and another one in his toils ausman never
saw him more

xv

i just happened to think of it
i think wed better call around early
and see her she sure is a game
little girl isnt she

  it was macdowell speaking he was
seated on the floor of the little jail his back
against the wall he showed no marks of
an all-night vigil or of the fast succession of
events-some of them distinctly energetic
from a physical as well as a mental stand-
point-of the previous evening

  youre right tex i shouldnt be sur-
prized if it was going to be up to us to help
her over some of the hard places in the next
few days theres really nobody much
here-a couple of women probably but no
one to take the work off her shoulders
carruthers slumped down in the chair
showed the marks of sleeplessness plainly
his handsome face was rather drawn and
his eyes had deep black rings around them
his curly hair was in a remarkably un-
kempt condition

corinne has had more hard luck than
comes to most girls resumed jack warm-

ing up to his favorite topic it was hard
enough for a girl like her to be cooped up
in a place like this and then to find that
her father was a fitzpatrick crook-

  he glanced through the bars at the heavy
motionless figure of the ex-border monarch
fitzpatrick fully dressed was stretched on
the bed it was impossible to tell whether
he was asleep or not

  i feel a lot of sympathy for the old man
though at that said tex fitzpatrick
hits below the belt and its no disgrace to
go down under that kind of fighting

  he got to his feet leisurely and blew out
the flickering oil lamp

  methinks the beams of the early morn
will be enough until the trusty sergeant
arrives he remarked as he resumed his
restful posture on the floor

  said beams of the early morn are wel-
come carruthers assured him stiffing
a yawn

  they had dispatched correll to get some
sleep so that he could guard fitzpatrick
during the day the slight break in legal
procedure by which the deputy slept while
total outsiders guarded the jail did not
bother them it was the year of our lord
nineteen hundred and twenty but in the
last few hours such things as law courts
and divers other civilized institutions had
receded into the background

  i cant help but feel as though i was
mixed up in daddy georges death some-
how said tex slowly his face very serious
as he gazed straight ahead of him

  it was the first time he had mentioned it
although it had been in his mind off and on
ever since the events of the evening before

  i can understand how you feel but if it
was your fault im a shavetail in the quar-
termaster corps declared jack of
course you helped him discover the blank
cartridges but he might have done that
anyway and theres no guarantee that
his change to real bullets was responsible
for his death although i admit that proba-
bly its the truth but theres no way
under heaven you could have figured it
tex

  i know-with our information as sketchy
and ill-founded as it was i believe we did

the only possible thing but-

 perhaps its better the old man died
anyhow tex there wouldnt have been
much left in life for him after this blew
over
o

adventure

  maybe not

  corinne is going to need a brotherly
lift- jack said in an effort to change
the subject tex interrupted him

  all lifts labeled brotherly ill look out
for he said with a quizzical grin i won-
der how shes going to be fixed on money
didnt you say she didnt have any relatives
or close friends

  not a one shes been marooned here
except for a couple of years at school ever
since shes been old enough to make any
friends shes only twenty

  well if shell let us i guess maybe we
can fix her up a little some way

  they fell silent each man apparently
immersed in his thoughts jack was think-
ing of the girl tex was thinking for the
hundredth time of what the events of the
preceding night meant to him there were
many ramifications he was under the im-
pression that fitzpatrick was a citizen of
mexico and not of the united states for
one and he was not at all sure of just what
the possibilities of the situation were es-
pecially the high-and-mighty arrest

  mr westons confession did not clear up
the cloud that hung over him on the charge
of carrying opium but it helped a great
deal as a starting point to work from it
was about a fifty-fifty chance that both
court martial and civilian jury would clear
him now that fitzpatrick was not in much
of a position to pull wires and keep the
anti-macdowell pot boiling up around san
antonio if by any chance his father to
whom he had dispatched a long wire the
night before had unearthed anything down
at mcmullen chances for an acquittal that
would clear his name completely were ex-
cellent

  he wondered how long it would be before
the county sheriff arrived from acacia
unless he was badly mistaken the sheriff
would have a texas ranger to help him after
macdowell senior arrived which tex was
sure he would in that case the search for
blackie stearns would be stimulated consid-
erably the pilot wondered who stearns was

  must be a bad egg he reflected with
darkening face as he thought of the bloody
work of stearns hand and fitzpatricks
mind

  mr westons death was bad enough but
somehow the thought of gentle white-
bearded old daddy george stretched on the
floor of the office shot to death as an inno-

cent pawn in a terrible game affected tex
as it had every one else even searles mac-
dowells natural elation at the lightening
of the clouds around him was strongly
tinged with bitter regret at the recollections
that must always accompany the thought
of ausman

  the sun was well up when correll arrived
to relieve the two flyers the sergeant was
in fine fettle and apparently really looked
forward to a day of association with dave
fitzpatrick

  well reminisce about the border he
remarked with a grin we got a lot of
mutual acquaintances aint we fitz

  fitz didnt answer

  how about food inquired correll just
before the others left

  buy him his meals at the spig refresh-
ery said tex giving the sergeant some
money may warm him up a httle he
hasnt been very sociable up to now
adios well probably be dropping by again
before long

  they repaired to the hotel drawing deep
breaths of the cool morning air as they
walked the short distance the sun had
a touch of red through the thin mist-it
was going to be a blistering day

  well after pruning the foliage and scrub-
bing up a bit ill sure be in shape to sur-
round a couple of healthy eggs remarked
tex as they ascended the veranda steps 

  ive got some whiskers to mow like-
wise match you to see whos first in the
so-called bathroom returned carruthers

  they stopped at the door drew out coins
and matched jack won eventually tex
succeeded in compromising to the extent
that he could bathe while jack shaved in
order to accelerate breakfast

  the shave followed by a bath-cold of
necessity-in the superannuated tin tub
woke up carruthers and increased mac-
dowells desire for breakfast clean clothes
from the skin out and a good breakfast-
the one meal of the day that was above
reproach in mr and mrs smiths hostelry
-completed the rehabilitation of the flyers
at nine oclock they set out for the weston
home

  the little white-haired housekeeper her
thin face showing signs of copious weeping
answered the door the flyers told her they
would wait out on the porch and seated
themselves on the lounge where they had
talked with corinne so often
feuds end



  soon she came out dressed in a simple
frock although her eyes showed dark
circles and her lips quivered a bit as she
greeted them she seemed only a little more
subdued and serious than usual

 miss corinne-began tex when she
interrupted him

  please dont add the miss she said
with a pathetic little smile that hinted at
her great need for friendship

  all right corinne said tex theres
just one thing we wanted to say this morn-
ing neither jack nor i are much on excess
talk along sentimental lines but we thought
-we hoped-that it might make things
a little easier for you if you knew that both
of us are just hoping that we can show you
a little bit of our sympathy by doing things
for you if it isnt too presumptuous to ask
you to look at us as your big brothers and
if youll just let us take everything off your
shoulders well be happy as clams theres
never going to be a time or a circumstance
that will alter our desire to do all we can for
our nervy little newly adopted sister
and that goes the limit too corinne
interjected carruthers his heart in his eyes
as he looked at her youve got those
friends and relatives we talked about last
night with a couple of hired men and care-
takers thrown in for good measure on your
front porch right now

  the girls hand touched the flyers for
a moment in silent thanks her eyes
tear-filled in spite of herself rose to meet
macdowells

  you dont-you cant know-somehow

thinking of father-

  her self-control gave way and she bowed
her head in her arm the broken arm in
a sling lent an additional touch of pathos
to the bowed head with its crown of glinting
auburn hair

  corinne of course there is really nothing
one can say i dont suppose came mac-
dowells voice gently but im sure that
after the first shock of your grief and your
disillusion have passed-that youll see things
more clearly than you do now perhaps if
youll pardon a rather personal reference
ive sort of knocked around quite a lot and
ive learned one thing i think-from what
people have often thought of me as well as
the reverse--and that is that there is seldom
a broken life or a convict or a suicide that
does not come as the result of happenings
that would ofttimes break the very men

and women who are the first to condemn

  your father stole money to try to save
your mothers life for years he has gone
through hell we all know and i am sure
that the only reason that he spent these
weary years in ausman was for your sake
and at the end he broke his own heart by
deliberately disillusioning you to try and
right the wrong he felt hed done to an able-
bodied man like me who doesnt amount to
much anyway whether or not your father
had been there fitzpatrick would have
tried to get me whatever else he may have
been forced to do mr weston was a loving
father above all and at the last a self-
sacrificing man who did all he could without
hope of reward

  specious although some of his words
might have been they were effective it
was an older more mature tex macdowell
whose softly slurred words came with quiet
sympathy and understanding to the piti-
fully friendless girl the tears came faster
but they were the tears that relieve and not
intensify the pangs of sorrow

  tex tactfully little by little drew the
subject away from mr weston

  finally corinne raised her head and
smiled

  ive been awfully silly and i hope youll
excuse me both of you she said both
my-my brothers she added shyly

  before they left the flyers had taken full
responsibility for funeral arrangements for
daddy george and mr weston they
touched on mr westons affairs none of
the three had any idea as to what part if
any of the store or its contents belonged
to him

  tex strolled down the walk slowly he
seized the opportunity when carruthers
asked for a drink

  jack drank his water and then took his
hat corinne held out her hand to him in
farewell but for some reason her eyes
wavered and fell

  corinne please dont worry-about
anything what tex said goes-every bit
of it-and as far as im concerned it goes-
well what i mean is that it doesnt stop
when all this is over and-and-oh shoot
i cant say it now but im going to some
day and-well just dont worry thats all

  of all the- unmitigated blithering

asses groaned jack as he walked swiftly
toward macdowell good lord if ever
a man-


adventure

  were you bound down-town to kill
somebody or merely rehearsing a stinging
denunciation of prohibition grinned tex

  what do you mean inquired jack
slowing up his rate of progress down the
road

  your face read make it or bust and
your eye sure looked mean likewise you
were shaking a wicked pair of feet and
pumping a mean pair of arms tex told
him

  oh i put my foot in it and was bawling
myself out admitted carruthers sheep-
ishly

  i gathered that from the piercing pink
of your cheeks cheer up jack unless all
signs fail youre soon going to put your foot
in it even deeper

  it may be gathered that tex himself was
not contemplating matrimony

xvi

   mth the sun-drenched field sent up
ptl shivery ever-changing heat-waves
wah that shimmered in blinding abun-
dance the two ships staked down and
covered were at one end and tex walked
slowly toward them it was midafternoon
but he did not feel the need of sleep he
had walked out to make sure that the planes
had not been tampered with at six oclock
the evening train was due if his wire had
caught macdowell senior at home he might
be in on that train--the only incoming train
of the day in ausman

  sheriff smithers from acacia had arrived
at noon via his official tin lizzie he proved
to be a small mean-looking man who looked
and acted like bad medicine to any one he
was after he had found tex and correll
at the jail and waxed blasphemous as he
read the authority dale had given correll

  where the-is dale he demanded

  havent seen him since last night tex
returned

  whats he been doing about rounding
up this murderer

  nothing that i know of and i shouldnt
be surprized if the sergeant here represented
the law as far as ausman is concerned

  i shouldnt either admitted smithers
this ausman has always been queer-
ive been held down in various ways and
of late never got no complaints whos the
prisoner

  name of dave fitzpatrick stated tex

 not that hombre from the border

 the sheriff talked in staccato phrases
 and gave the impression that he was operat-
 ing on tex with the third degree

the same replied tex negligently
rolling a cigaret

what for

read this and see its a confession
from one of the murdered men signed and
witnessed before he died

 the sheriff grabbed the precious pieces of
 paper and started to read rapidly in
 a moment he looked up at tex and pushed
 his black felt hat lower over his eyebrows

macdowell your name he asked

tex nodded

 macdowell macdowell lets see-
say are you the man that was caught
smuggling opium up to donovan field

 right

what the - are you doing down

 here

none of your-business officially

returned tex who did not like the tone
which the sheriff used

 dont be too sure of that returned the
 unruffled sheriff even if you are in the
 army

oh im sure enough but if you just
want to know personally there are a couple
of ships out here one cracked up and im
down with the sergeant and another pilot
to bring it back satisfy you

 no but then it doesnt matter

 the sheriff finished reading westons con-
 fession and then handed it back to tex
 tex and correll between them told him the
 story of succeeding events and of their
 suspicions of vancouver b dale

 smithers his dark face frowning vicious-
 ly chewed rapidly on a long stogie

 big stuff here in view of the circum-
 stances id better phone up to acacia for
 a big posse did you wire any other
 places

plenty tex answered and named
them over

 the sheriff nodded approvingly

 ill send some more and include dale
 in em he announced ill send fitz-
 patrick back to acacia we got a jail
 therell hold him ive got two deputies
 outside theyll take him back lock him
 up and boost along a big posse ill stay
 here and get busy telegraph and telephone
 may scare up a few men here

tex grinned as he inspected the ships
feuds end



 leisurely and thought of smithers he had
 had no qualms whatever about handing
 fitzpatrick into his charge smithers was
 nasty in his attitude but he was every inch
 efficient the town had been buzzing since
 his arrival and undoubtedly many posses
 were scouring the surrounding country
 right then for steams word had been
 flashed far and wide already undoubtedly
 newspaper extras in san antonio dallas
 houston and el paso were screaming the
 news of the double murder if the informa-
 tion regarding dave fitzpatrick had been
 included it would have been an honest-to-
 goodness sensation reflected tex

  the ship he and carruthers had flown
was in excellent shape even to gas and oil
the radiator had not been filled but there
was still some water in it from the trip
down tex almost decided to take a flight
among the fleecy white clouds that marched
slowly from the gulf in never ending rows
of snowy white

  the wrecked ship was just as it had been
left tex eased himself down to the ground
and lay beneath a wing the hum of
a thousand insects sounded drowsily in his
ears he was forced to light a cigaret to
keep the gnats from being bothersome-
had it not been for that he would probably
have dozed off into slumber

  he strove to think of anything he had
left undone-there was nothing but looking
over mr westons papers and he wanted
his father there for that he had wired
macdowell senior not from any particular
need of him but only because he was sure
the old man would be tickled to death to be
in the middle of things-and undoubtedly
would bring along with him a ranger or
some other representative of the law that
could take command and actually make
things move toward the finding of the mur-
derer of daddy george and mr weston
he had not known just how much the
county sheriff would amount to in so im-
portant a case

  his thoughts grew more vague and he
drifted off into a blissful state of half-sleep
and half-wakefulness that speedily grew
into sound sleep how long he had slept
he did not know but he was awakened bv
a rude shaking he awakened to look into
the barrel of a perfectly good-looking gun
the owner thereof possessed a sullen-look-
ing face that was positively repulsive now-
a two-day stubble of black beard blood-

shot eyes and mouth that was twisted into
a perpetual snarl from the strain of the last
twenty-four hours

  get up and get busy directed the man
with the gun quick-it

  tex rolled out from under the wing and
sat up

  wthat do you want money he in-
quired easily

  no you and me are goin for a ride
over the border and if you value a whole
hide youll commence movin right now

  tex stood up and began to remove the
propeller cover with apparent speed but
actual slowness his mind was casting
around eagerly in all probability this was
steams-what was the best method of
handling him or trying to a bluff about
the ship not working would probably be
effective although risky

  the pilot tingled with the fierce elation
that filled him for days he had been
keenly watchful playing a dangerous game
with all his might and with every realiza-
tion of its importance now that was over
and the deliberate playing for high stakes
at great risk which was the macdowell
habit was the only thought he had now
somehow or other he would gamble his all
against stearns on the chance of getting
the upper hand of the man who was hold-
ing a gun on him now

  i dont see yet how youre going to make
me carry you over the border remarked
tex as he finally slipped off the propeller
cover and started on the motor cover

  the dark face grew darker stearns was
in no mood to be balked

  you dont eh he patted the gun
meaningly i guess it wont hurt me none
to have another man added to the score
he stated

  the rather debonair sullenly handsome
rider of a day before had disappeared-
apparently stearns had roved around the
entire night because his face was cut and
scratched his clothing slightly torn and
his eyes and face showed the effect of sleep-
lessness and nervous tension

  tex hesitated for a moment-should he
take a chance on what he was going to say
next for the sake of a plan that had leaped
into his mind in a flash he had made his
decision and his words came casually as he
folded the engine cover

  after we get in the air what are you
going to do he queried if i take a


adventure

notion to fly where i want to and you shoot
me you might just as well point the gun
against your own head-youll come down

a - of a lot faster than you went up

with me a goner

  stearns face was horrible for a moment
he had almost given up hope when he had
spotted the figure of a man near the ship
from some distance off his plan for an
airplane ride providing the man was a
pilot had leaped into his mind with heart-
ening possibilities macdowells last words
dashed his hopes for a moment and the
awful temper that was the source of his
present predicament convulsed the dark
face with all-consuming wrath tex was
never nearer death than he was for the
space of a few seconds while stearns finger
itched on the trigger of his gun

  some saving remnant of self control in-
duced by the thought that his only hope of
escape lay in the tall careless pilot before
him kept stearns from pulling the trigger
tex had won his first point the reddened
eyes of the rider rested on the plane and as
they did a light of fierce triumph leaped
into them

  i might be committing suicide to shoot
you mister he sneered but theres other
ways i figure you wouldnt like to have an
eye gouged out now would you

  he worked his thumb with horrible
meaning

  so any time you get gay just remember
ill be leanin forward from the back seat
there and out comes an eye at the first
sign of any o your tricks savvy

  macdowells eyes rested on the fifteen
inch cowling that separated back and front
cockpits

  i guess youve got me he admitted
strangely though he did not seem dis-
appointed

  come on get busy here and dont talk
so much snapped stearns and tex
obeyed

  the riders eyes roved around nervously
the nearest shack was a half-mile away
the big bam was deserted not a sign of
human life except an automobile passing
along the pike a quarter of a mile or more
away was in sight to worry him and he
relaxed somewhat

  youre stearns arent you inquired
tex as he busily pulled stakes and cut the
knots in the stake-ropes

  ye-ah youre macdowell aint you

  right by the way now that youvt
got me roped theres no sense of being hard
might as well be as pleasant as possible
under the circumstances both of us if 
was in your fix and had no smokes id sure
like one right now how about it

  the bold bloodshot black eyes lit up
eagerly had it not been that on either
hand of stearns tex could see in his imagina-
tion the forms of daddy george and mr
weston he might have had it in his heart
to pitv his captor

  he held out tobacco and papers stearns
took them gingerly his gun ever ready

  wait a minute till i shake you down
he ordered

  with gun pressed against the flyer he
quickly searched him and then stood him
with his hands up while he examined the
cockpits quickly for any signs of a weapon
satisfied he turned back again

  all right hombre hustle he ordered
and in a moment more was dragging in soul-
satisfying lungfuls of smoke

  tex was not the man he had been in the
previous days-every chance a carefully
calculated one one idea uppermost and his
personal desires secondary the pilot was
actually hoping that no one would appear
on the scene to spoil his plan he yearned to
pit himself against the man who had been
a part of the vicious conspiracy against him
and the murderer of two old men besides
the flyers chances were not more than one
in five but he leaped at the opportunity
slight thoughit was and horrible as the con-
sequences would be to him if he failed

  blocks were already under the wheels he
climbed into the cockpit and turned on the
gas then he pumped up the air pressure
to three pounds and primed the cylinders
with the little priming-pump on the dash-
board this done he climbed out again and
twisted the propeller several times to suck
additional gas into the engine

  stearns watched him carefully as he
worked the murderer had taken the prof-
fer of cigarets as a capitulation he felt
that tex was afraid of him now that the
unsolicited smoke was an effort to dissipate
stearns anger and resentment the out-
law puffed contentedly at his second cigaret

  tex climbed back in the cockpit turned
on the starting-switch and whirled the self-
starter rapidly the booster-magneto failed
to start the motor that time but the second
time it hit thanks to the hot sun that had
feuds end



kept the sturdy hundred and eighty horse-
power engine warm

  as the roar of the motor filled the air
stearns became nervous for two reasons
one was that the noise might draw on-
lookers and the other and momentarily
more important one was the inevitable
excitement and fear of the landsman at the
thought of a trip up into a most unsub-
stantial sky in a frail-looking linen-and-
wood frame for a most disturbingly big and
noisy motor

  stearns came close to the ship leaning
against the wind of the propeller and bel-
lowed into macdowells ear-

  were startin right now hear

  tex cut the warming motor to idling as
he said

  shes got to warm up a little more or

shes liable to cut for -s sake dont

try to butt in on flying-you dont know

a-thing about it and youll just kill the

both of us if you dont lay off shell be
readyin about a minute now-climb in and
ill strap you

  stearns face grew ugly for a moment but
he could not argue the matter with his
gun pointed at tex he climbed in slowly and
sank into the seat it was another ticklish
moment for tex macdowells scheme as he
fastened the huge snap-buckle on the wide
canvas belt around stearns the gun was
pressed tight against him as he did it

  keep your feet flat on the floor and your
hands off everything do you understand
said tex raising his voice only slightly for
the motor was still idling

  except you retorted stearns

  tex grinned

  im not forgetting that he said

  he was leaning over from the front cock-
pit he did not betray the fact that his plan
was hanging on the narrow edge of failure
if stearns should realize but one thing-
somehow it seemed to the pilot that the
dutlaw must think of it but his voice was
quiet and his air almost careless as he point-
ed out the throttle on the left hand side
the switch on the right and the rudder
as things especially to be avoided ty an igno-
rant passenger the stick had not been put
in since it was removed to carry corinne

  you can send us into the ground by
touching any one of them tex told him
well i guess we can start as soon as i pull
the blocks

  he turned up the motor for a moment

   

temperature was only  centigrade but
that would do in a pinch it ran smoothly
so he cut the throttle crawled beneath the
wings and pulled the crude blocks correll
had fashioned

  he saw a car turn into the side-road that
led to the field another one was rolling
along the main pike far across the flat
fields with the shacks dotting them at inter-
vals a few tiny figures could be seen where
mexicans were at work it was quiet
peaceful lazily rural and summery that
gun-barrel peeping at him from the back
cockpit was very close and very remindful
however

  he was going to be compelled to fly with-
out helmet or goggles as was stearns
however there were big isinglass wind-
shields on the sturdy jenny and the speed
would not be so tremendous nor the pro-
peller blast so powerful as in a d h by
hunching well down behind the windshield
it would not be hard to fly for the few mo-
ments that would decide one of two things
whether onlyblackie stearns would lose or
whether they both would not until they
actually got well off the ground would it
be certain that he would have an oppor-
tunity to try his scheme

  he did not hurry as he lounged around
the wing and climbed in he was more de-
liberate than usual in fact stearns shak-
ing slightly but with no hint of weakness in
his face beckoned tex with the gun as the
flyer started to throw his leg over the cowl
not by the slightest sign did tex betray the
fact that it would have meant failure to all
his plans if stearns had waited another two
seconds to indicate to the pilot that he
wanted to say something

  if you still want to have a pair o eyes
fly south and dont stop and dont do nothin
but get there stearns said as tex leaned
toward him

  tex nodded once more his eyes resting
briefly on the unshaven forbidding face so
close to his own thenhe slid into the front
cockpit buckledhis belt swiftly and shoved
on the throttle without an instants delay
he was atingle with reckless delight as they
sped across the ground and finally swept
upward he had gambled heavily and so
far the game was a winning one for him

  he flew straight south climbing as fast
as he dared the westering sun was very
close to the horizon-he must have slept
a couple of hours it was very bumpy-


adventure

every time plowed land was beneath them
the ship would rush upward and the occa-
sional damp places always flopped them
earthward from ten to twenty feet as alter-
nate currents of hot air rushing upward and
cold currents coming down caught the ship

  the motor was turning sixteen -hundred
and getting hot there was not a great
deal of water in the radiator he knew oil
and air pressures were exactly right though

  at a thousand feet he decided to take his
chance he looked back at stearns who
was crouching down in his seat to save his
eyes macdowells own eyes were watery-
he put up a hand to shield them as he looked
back no thought of pity for the man be-
hind him undermined his determination
had he been inclined that way the tableau
in the office that was etched on his memory
would have decided him

  he banked so gradually that stearns did
not realize what he was doing until the ship
had traveled a considerable distance back
toward ausman macdowell waited for
the moment when stearns would look
around and see the waters of the gulf
stretching to his right instead of the left
what would he do-which one of two
things the next few seconds would de-
termine whether tex himself lived or died-
for the murderer of daddy george and mr
weston there was no hope in any event

  they were twelve hundred feet high now
and tex turned in his seat nosed down
gradually he noted subconsciously that
the train was approaching the depot three
miles away from where they were flying
the glowing gray eyes watched stearns like
a hawk

  the rider looked up and his gaze met
macdowells steady regard he guarded
his eyes with his hand as he straightened up
to look over the side of the cockpit the
wires were screaming with the speed as with
motor wide open the ship roared toward the
ground

  for a moment the outlaw peered down
steadily then his eyes swept the gulf-on
his right instead of his left the dark for-
bidding face contorted with fury and the
big body lunged forward a long arm
stretched toward tex

  the pilot was bent forward as far as
possible stearns arm did not reach within
a foot of him the buckled belt held him
tight to the low seat-something that the
landsman had not figured on

  it was the supreme moment for tex
would the raging stearns use his gun in the
heat of his wrath or would he unbuckle his
belt to reach him stearns struggled wildly
for a moment his eyes almost blinded by
the terrific speed then tex saw his head
drop in a second stearns lunged for him
the belt buckle unsnapped

  like a flash tex jerked back on the stick
and jammed on left rudder the ship
swooped up and over on its back in a fast
immelman turn the hand clutched at him
for a second and was gone tex was low--
less than a thousand feet but he pushed
forward on the stick and neutralized his
rudder holding the ship on its back for
a moment then he jerked back on the
stick and swooped downward and right side
up again four hundred feet from the ground

  the back cockpit was empty

carruthers after a brief nap
had spent the afternoon with co-
rinne the doctor had attended to
securing an undertaker from acacia and
the bodies of mr weston and daddy
george encased in simple coffins were in
the parlor of the weston home corinne
and jack had escaped from the depressing
influence of the silent house by taking
a long walk

  as six oclock approached jack who knew
that tex half-expected his father on the
train suggested to corinne that they both
go to the depot tex would be there and
they could all meet macdowell senior he
hacl told her of macdowelps idea that they
have his father attend to straightening up
the business affairs of mr weston and she
bad thankfully accepted it would not be
wise for either of the flyers to do it-tex by
reason of his conspicuous and unsavory
notoriety and carruthers for still other
reasons which he did not mention

  as the train whistled for the crossing
a mile away carruthers turned with a sur-
prized exclamation

  that sounds like a ship

  it is-see there it is corinne replied
pointing to the plane that was just rising
above the houses and trees of ausman

  thats funny i dont see why tex is
going up now unless he wanted to escort
his father in by airplane if that was his
idea hes a little late
feuds end



  the knot of hangers-on around the sta-
tion-a quite considerable number for
ausmanwas no different from other south-
ern towns in its habit of turning out to see
the train come in-watched the ship inter-
estedly

  the incoming train got little attention as
everybody watched the plane turn back
toward town the train drew to a stop and
the first of the passengers got off carru-
thers was starting forward to look for mr
macdowell when a scream from corinne
and loud exclamations from many others
made him turn around

  the ship was just going on its back and
in speechless horror the onlookers saw the
unmistakable body of a man fall out and
come hurtling earthward one arm around
the half-fainting corinne carruthers waited
in dumb agony then a great shout came
from his lips and he did a crazy dance
around the platform

  the ship came level-it isnt tex he
whooped in wild abandon of joy corinne
could not believe her ears

  i dont know what the deal is but theres
a pilot in that ship-look said carruthers
above the jostling excited mob of people
that surrounded them

  a huge black-sombreroed figure threw
a half dozen people aside and grabbed
carruthers by the shoulder

  are you jack carruthers

  the full lined face was drawn and work-
ing and beneath the gray mustache the
mouth was a thin line carruthers looked
up at the huge gray-headed man with a
radiant grin

  i am and youre mr macdowell
dont worry-that was not tex see the
ship is all right and is coming down to
land

  sure demanded the old ranchman
beads of sweat on his forehead

  absolutely lets get out there and see
what happened im as much in the dark
as you are

  the big ranchman drew a breath of re-
lief his eyes regained their customary
twinkle and his mouth the whimsical crook
that was so much like his sons expression

  this is miss weston mr macdowell
said carruthers

  mr macdowell took her hand in both of
his and patted it gently

  im glad to know you miss weston
he said with more gentleness than many of

his acquaintances would have believed he

possessed

  he turned and looked over the heads of
the people on the platform who were
jabbering excitedly many of them had
started in autos and on foot for the field
the airplane was out of sight now-it had
evidently landed

  oh cary come on-you too cor-
win boomed his great voice and two men
picked up grips and started toward them

  ive got the town jitney engaged out
here-or rather our private jitney i hope
he hasnt run away jack told mr mac-
dowell as they waited for the other two men

  young smith his jaws working at blind-
ing speed was awaiting them mr mac-
dowell eased himself into the front seat and
piled the baggage in around him the two
civilians and corinne got in the back and
jack hung on the running board

  drive easy to save miss westons arm
jack ordered

  excuse me-this is captain cary of the
texas rangers and mr corwin of the
consolidated press up in san antone-
miss weston and lieutenant carruthers
said mr macdowell

  the ranger was a hatchet-faced keen-
eyed man with the deep tan of the old-timer
in texas he looked to be about forty
years old he was thin and wiry and had
a pronounced drawl the newspaperman
possessed a cherubic countenance decorated
with immense horn spectacles

  on the way to the field carruthers leav-
ing out any reference to recent events in
ausman talked continuously to keep any
of the men from asking embarrassing ques-
tions in corinnes presence the ranger
and mr macdowell would know the full
story eventually but jack did not want to
discuss it in corinnes hearing it was com-
paratively easy to do for every one was
eager to find out details of the horrible sight
they had just witnessed

  at least a hundred people half of them
tattered mexicans were before them an
excited throng surrounded tex whose head
could be seen above the crowd jack
stood up on the running board and yelled in
stentorian tones tex caught sight of him
and waved as he started toward the car

  hello dad-thought you might rove
in he greeted his father shaking hands
and acknowledging introductions to cor-
win and cary


adventure

  what happened just now demanded
his father

  tex told them the story briefly the
crowd had followed him over prominent
among them was balavo the mexican
whose attention was about equally divided
between the story and corinne

  there was absolute silence as the flyer
his eyes on his father most of the time
sketched the tale

  mr westons written story of the mur-
der of himself and daddy george-which
you dont know the details of yet gentle-
men-named stearns and he admitted his
identity to me i guess i can clear myself
on self-defense or something anyway

  by the mighty ill bet a heap its the
man that shot bogie bill drumm ex-
claimed the ranger

  he and corwin whose round eyes were
sparkling behind his glasses told tex of the
recent murder of the showman the ranger
made off toward the next field where the
remains of stearns lay tex told him that
smithers was already on the job and that
most of the posse that had cbme down on
the train was already there likewise cary
who was familiar with various specifications
in the nationwide circular that had gone out
describing stearns could not rest until he
satisfied himself whether the dead man was
the wanted murderer of bogie bill or not

  the crowd followed the ranger-rumors
of his identity had already been spread
about-and left the others reasonably free
from curious onlookers mr macdowell
with rare tact that seemed incongruous to
associate with so big and direct a personal-
ity did not question his son regarding the
double murder or what he had found out
about fitzpatrick

  lee boy you got away on this stearns
thing just now but what in hallelujah did
you run your neck in a noose like that for
that bird was liable to muss you up there

  tex standing with hands in the back
pockets of his breeches grinned at his gray-
haired parent

  i dont suppose you ever took a chance
did you he inquired

  his father looked at him severely

  thats no excuse you wild-eyed totally
foolish kid ill bet you were tickled to
death at the chance

  tex sobered his eyes turning to corinnes
face for a moment he leaned over and
touched her hand lightly

  i was dad stearns had it coming to
him you know

  mr macdowell turned around and met
the girls eyes

  he sure did-dont think im not
tickled to death your fathers murderer is
punished miss weston and furthermore
id a done the same thing in lees place

  she smiled faintly-and gained a powerful
ally in roaring bill macdowell

  it was the same hombre came carys
voice as he and smithers hurried toward
the car

  the newspaper mans eyes snapped

  gee what a story he breathed

  he was aching to get to the telegraph
office details on the murder of mr wes-
ton and the night-watchman could wait
for another story-with luck he could land
an extra in every city in texas that night

  well boys weve got to thrash things
out pronto declared macdowell senior
looks like poetic justice and ail that sort
of thing has been perpetrated by this scamp
of a son of mine but i guess theres a few
ends to be cleaned up yet lets go shall
we

  smithers suppose you tend to getting
stearns body down-town and so forth
cary said to the county sheriff who had
been waiting silently come to the hotel
after supper and well get down to tacks

  suits me barked smithers and made
off with quick short strides

  corinne youre coming to the hotel
tonight to eat stated carruthers from the
running-board

  tex was on the other one and the over-
loaded jitney made hard going over the
sandy road now deeply rutted from the
passage of many cars

  of course she is stated mr macdowell
heartily he surmised the friendless con-
dition of the lovely girl-his sons wire had
mentioned her

smithers several of his deputies
the ranger the newspaperman and
the macdowells occupied a big
table at the hotel with carruthers and
corinne at a smaller one near the window
after dinner jack and corinne wandered off
toward the bank of the gulf and smithers
tex his father and cary went into execu-
tive session the flyers telegram had been
phoned to his father in austin and he had
picked up cary an old friend and started
feuds end



immediately corwin a friend of carys
had been on the train from san antonio
ausman-bound

  tex told them all that had happened
answering innumerable questions from the
keen-eyed cary and his father as he went
along he read the confession of mr
weston aloud when he had finished the
tale cary turned to the ranchman and
remarked dryly-

  quite a son you got bill

  mr macdowell shook his head sadly as
he looked at the smiling tex

  its an awful thing not to be able to
control your children he opined well
son this is just about going to clear up your
mess at donovan field i guess without
what little weve accomplished old bill
trowbridge sheriff of hidalgo county
finally landed the soldier that had been seen
chumming around with a strange mexican
and he confessed that he got drunk on guard
the night before you and hickman left for
donovan on liquor this spig who was
a well-dressed classy-lookin mex gave
him thats something but we cant find
hide nor hair of said spig

  well said captain cary of the rangers
slowly heres what weve got as i see it
fitzpatricks in jail with a confession thats
iron-clad and will be the means of getting
lots more evidence to break him the
mexican government will come across all
right now that obregons in daves goose
is cooked the murderer of weston and
old george dobey has been attended to
from what your boy here says about dale
hell talk when hes caught and smithers
has fixed it so he sure will be others in
this townll tell all they know too and some
 that bunch thats been rounded up along
the border will converse free and easy when
they find old daves up a tree as far as
this smuggling deal of the boy here is
concerned theres no chance of anything
but an acquittal-maybe dismissal of the
charges without a court martial or a trial
of any kind it would be a little better
from your view-point if that could be cleaned
up complete by nailing whoever planted
the opium but im afraid we cant do
that

  smithers nodded his agreement with the
rangers summary

  well lee for once your infernal ability
to get into trouble has got you some gravy
as it were grinned mr macdowell

throwing his cigaret butt into the water
below the men were seated on the bank

  looks that way admitted tex

next morning while the repre-
sentatives of the law were very
busy mr macdowell and tex
went over mr westons papers they
found a fully paid life insurance policy for
twenty thousand dollars payable to co-
rinne and a bank account in a san antonio
bank of some ten thousand dollars more
they went up tothe weston home and
after a long talk with corinne mr mac-
dowell persuaded her to accept a sizeable
loan pending the settling of her fathers
estate it was decided that corinne should
live in san antonio for a while at least and
take with her the little housekeeper that
had been with the westons so long jack
carruthers nearly turned a handspring on
the front porch when this was settled

  that afternoon came the simple funeral
for mr weston and daddy george the
minister from acacia primed by tex
handled it delicately and the ceremony was
marred by no reference to the things that
increased the grief of her fathers loss to
corinne mr weston and daddy george
were laid away in a tiny grove near the old
pioneers shack

  the hotel dinirfg-room that evening held
several newspapermen in addition to the
three airmen mr macdowell smithers
and captain cary and corinne mr wes-
tons confession had been kept a secret
-all that the newspapermen knew was
that there was excellent secret evidence to
account for fitzpatricks incarceration and
the fixing of the crime of the double mur-
der on stearns wanted for the death of
bogie bill drumm the best news men in
texas were there the importance of mr
macdowell in texas the sensational career
of his son and the vague but widespread
fame of dave fitzpatrick made it the story
of their lives for the journalists

  there was to be one more event to give
the final touch and force the bright young
men of the press into almost hysterical
bursts of literary invention as they wrote
their stories

  the small dining-room was buzzing as
the details of the last few days were gone
over for the steenth time without warn-
ing a short bowlegged middle-aged man
appeared in the doorway he was dressed


adventure

in a faded sack suit boots and flannel
shirt two guns sagged from beneath the
coat

  tex who was sitting at the lower end of
the long table saw him first

  searles he exclaimed involuntarily
as he recognized one of the participants in
the el paso poker game which represented
his first contact with dave fitzpatrick

  well ill be- burst from mr mac-
dowell in utter surprize

  he made a move as if he was going to
rise so quickly that it seemed like a feat
of magic two long guns covered the com-
pany searles tanned wrinkled face did not
change nor did the inscrutable puckered
eyes betray excitement

  sit down please and everybody put
their hands on the table said searles

  every one obeyed as if in a trance
corinnes eyes were wide and frightened

  gentlemen-and miss weston-i aint
aimin to keep you long i was a friend o
daddy george dobeys which was killed
by that skunk stearns i been hangin
around to settle up with stearns myself
but this young wildcat here done it for me
i hear and done it -- well if youll pardon
me swearin miss weston

  consequently feelin considerable hap-
py and relieved over the original and satis-
factory method invented by young mac-
dowell there i figured id try to do him
a favor that might help out a little im
bio win cary he added his eyes turning
to the ranger

  what i wanted to say was this-if you
want the straight of that opium deal which
youre hung for at present get manuel
veriga that youll find hangin out in
juarez he may be in mexico city now
but hell be back before long hes yellow
and he planted that stuff in your ship
macdowell hell tell all he knows if you
catch him get him at the end of a gun in
juarez and hell sign a confession before
witnesses snow in san antonio was in
the scheme too but dont know much
about it

  thats all only it wont be healthy for
anybody to start chasin me when i go from
here you aint got nothin on me cary
but in case you took a notion to grab me-
dont just set here for a matter o fif-
teen minutes until i make one o these
launch--

  dont worry searles boomed mr

macdowell you aint going to be
bothered-i believe your information is
straight

  it is stated the imperturbable searles
i figured you might not want to bother
me

  been playin any poker lately searles
queried the old man with twinkling eyes

  the ghost of a smile hovered on the out-
laws lips as he looked at tex he shook
his head slightly in humorous self-deprecia-
tion and vanished into the deepening dusk

hp an hour later mr macdowell
gshs and captain cary were seated on
the veranda of the smith hostelry
smoking and talking as they gazed out
across the gulf jack and corinne were
sitting on the bank in the deep shadow cast
by a gnarled mesquite tree a full moon
blazed a shimmering path of pale silver
across the tranquil water even ausman
seemed beautiful in the soft light and deep
shadows that gilded or hid all that was ugly
the lights of one slowly moving vessel
twinkled from afar across the water

  tex who had been shooting craps with
the reporters came slowly around the cor-
ner of the hotel and walked to the edge of
the bank he did not notice either of the
pairs who were watching him he stood
quietly in his characteristic position of
lounging ease hands resting in the back
pockets of his trousers

  up on the porch cary pulled at his pipe

  that boy o your has got a lot of the
devil in him hasnt he bill he queried

  he hasagreed the old ranchman hes
always been sort of harmlessly wild if you
get what i mean but that dont worry me
what i do mind is his infernal habit of
steppin into holes just for the fun of gettin
out of em

  at which hes a bear stated the ranger

  corinne was wondering what tex was
thinking about as he stood looking out
across the water she would have been
surprized had she known recent events
played a part in his thoughts but the
whimsical cast of his features was very pro-
nounced as his level gray eyes remained
fixed on the lights of the passing ship far
across the gulf tex was living up to the
motto which probably unrealized by even
himself epitomized his attitude toward life
insofar as he individually was concerned-

  it takes a good man to laugh at himself
author of the traveling man a dorset man etc

ansy took a sack of rice from
his saddle-bags poured a cup-
ful of it into a saucepan added
water and set it on the embers
of our fire

  i like rice best when it is steamed not
boiled he said it wont boil on these
embers and well let this sit here till supper
lime and youll find it tender as cheese

  i laughed

  i thought i was the only ex-service man
living who still cared for rice i said
didnt your division get much of it

  ill say we did but not so much till
we got up into germany and then beau-
coup-tres beaucoup and the way those
slum-burners used to cook it a thick paste
it was so solid you could cut it into slices
mostly but it isnt the army i think of
when i eat rice its something else

  tansy and i were prospecting for silver
in the tuscarora mountains in the northern
part of nevada his horse had gone lame
so we were resting up for a day or two our
camp was at the bottom of a little gulch
between boulder-strewn hills with a little
brook of ice-cold water running through it
and abundant grass for our animals

  having lighted his pipe from a coal which
he lifted from the fire between two twigs
chop-stick fashion tansy puffed thought-
fully for a minute and then said

  see here did i ever tell you about the
mutiny on the melilla then ill tell you
about it now because it was rice that
started that mutiny what i mean is the

crew wanted rice and there wasnt any
the ships officers had eaten it so the
crew thought they would start something
and they did believe me

  english ship the melilla an ocean
tramp with sickness in her guts by that
i mean rotten engines and a chinese
crew i dont know what she brought out
from leith i wasnt with her then my
chance came when the third officer took
violently sick at valparaiso and had to be
sent ashore

  we took on nitrates for baltimore and
went south that was before the panama
canal was opened-just a few weeks before
everything tight so far the captain was
scotch a white-haired chap very profane
except on sundays when he read his bible
first and second officers young english-
men nice fellows but quiet

  so we would have been a silent bunch
except for the passenger cameron his
name was or so he said but i never knew
a cameron to carry around a yiddish news-
paper which this man did when he came
aboard at that you couldnt help liking
him he was jolly and clean-minded lost
money with the rest of us at poker and
didnt worry over it good company youd
have said on a long trip like that

  this cameron had a dog fox-terrier
size only she was dark gray and he had her
trimmed spaniel-fashion hair cut close
all over her body except for a tuft on the
tip of her tail and ruffs around her ankles
and from her shoulders forward the hair

adventure

was natural length youve seen em like
that he called her panama he said
she was pedigreed and he had been offered
fifteen hundred dollars for her but the
skipper couldnt believe that he said he
wouldnt give five pounds for the best dog
ever littered

  the bitch wore a collar as remarkable
as herself a broad steel band lined with soft
leather and studded with spikes half an inch
long and sharp too on the buckle-plate
was a rosette of cut glass as big around as
a silver dollar the center-piece was a blob
of color you know what a pecan nut is
well it was as big as that and then some
it was a dark wine-red ive seen rubies
just that clear color

  around it was a circle of smaller glasses
three of white then one of green but they
were much smaller it was just tinsel-
a pretty bauble the weight of the orna-
ment held it always at the lowest point of
the collar that is under the dogs throat
where it wasnt very noticeable on account
of the long hair

  panama wasnt a dog to make friends
easily i dont mean she was surly-nothing
like that-just reserved she never fawned
to be petted the way most dogs do when
they get to know you never followed you
around the ship even cameron she didnt
follow much and seldom came on the bridge
even when he was there she didnt seem
to like the ladder-open stairs you know
with a steep pitch

  her favorite napping-place was on the
raised deck in the bow over the galley where
she would lie for hours at a stretch maybe
she found it cooler there i dont know
but she didnt seem to mind the chinks at
all and they got a lot of fun out of her on
account of the way she was tailored

  one day a group of them discovered the
ornament on her collar and one fellow tried
to twist the collar around where they could
see it better but panama bared her teeth
at him and they all pushed back from her
in a hurry

hi said the melilla had- rotten
engines well half-way to the
magellan the old lady got pains in
her insides and we shut down to doctor her
up nothing short of a general overhauling
would do the chief engineer said and it was
three days before we got going again she
ran for sixteen hours and lay down and quit

the chief was only a day patching her up this
time and we got clear of the straits and
were off cape virgin before we had more
trouble it seemed then as if wed never
get going again

  after two-three days tinkering they got
the shaft to turning and we started and
then-say you remember that hike to the
rhine fall out fall in fall out fall
in well that was us for the next four or
five days the old lady would twist her
tail for a few hours and then rest for an-
other half-day then at some unexpected
minute she would start off again just like
that no more reason to her than a balky
mule two weeks later we were only off
the coast of uruguay more than thirty
degrees down from the line

  it was then we began to husband our
provisions when the choicest of them
went it became a question of burgoo or
rice

  burgoo-any old sailor can tell you what
that is oatmeal gruel with a dash of butter
and sugar to take the curse from it-if you
have the butter and sugar if you havent
salt is the only seasoning you get with it
the cook under orders from the skipper was
conserving the sugar for our drinkables so
the burgoo got no sweetening as for
butter that had gone the way of all flesh
with sinful disregard of our necessities

  we voted for burgoo the young eng-
lish officers had a silly prejudice against
rice a sort of racial antipathy for it it was
chink food it was bad enough they
thought to eat scotch burgoo but that at
least was a white mans dish

  they stood it for four days while the old
melilla limped along at about nine knots
then they declared a lurid preference for
rice and that began to give out so the crew
was put on burgoo

  that ships larder was shamefully
understocked but you know how it is
no matter how decrepit a ship is or how
miserly her owners are therell always be
some one to take her out the only emer-
gency rations we carried were oatmeal and
hardtack both deck and fire-room were
undermanned the skipper told us the
melilla was owned by two leith merchants
of small means who wanted a little adven-
ture and took it by proxy sending the ship
out a torment to all concerned with her
we would have given considerable to have
had the owners on that trip with us
the mutiny



  the chinks it seemed didnt take kindly
to the burgoo three meals of it were
enough to convince them of its undesirability
as a diet they got the cook who was one
of themselves to speak to the captain about
it he sent back word that the rice was
practically gone and burgoo it would be
or nothing till we found a port but he
promised to put in at rio for supplies

  i didnt blame the chinks for sickening
of the porridge my stomach refused it
after three days fillings of it and i was
never noted for a delicate gizzard but the
skipper i cant see what the heathen are
complaining for he said in scotland
now-

   aye in scotland growled the chief
engineer who was half scotch himself but
had a vast preference for irish potatoes
every people to their own taste he said
how would you like a diet of birds-nests
sir or macaroni say three times a day
world without end and if i live to set
foot in leith again theres going to be
murder done there of two gentlemen

   tush william the skipper said re- 
provinglv thats no way to speak of our
employers

   tush tammas the chief said back
at him with a grin youve already mur-
dered them in your heart and thats almost
the same thing as the good book shows
well the days passed pretty slow for us
as you can well imagine of course the
chief and his assistants were busy enough
with the engines they didnt dare turn
them over very fast for fear they would
shake themselves to pieces the first and
second officers the passenger cameron and
i killed time playing poker there wasnt
anything else to do we played penny-ante
and got a lot of fun out of it

  the second officer ward-i got to like
him very well he wasnt what you would
call gay but he was keen-minded had been
around quite a bit and could talk about
anything from thackeray to submarines
he and i planned to go out together in an-
other ship after we got to leith but the
mutiny changed all that

it was about that time that
panama disappeared cameron
used to feed her when he first came
on deck in the morning she usually went
up into the bows then when he called her
one morning she didnt come to him we

combed the ship from the focsle tothe bunk-
ers but never saw her again we thought she
had fallen overboard all but cameron who
insisted that the chinks had thrown her
over he was much upset over it

   wfiy should the crew drown her we
asked

   revenge he said theyve turned
ugly from having no rice im merely super-
cargo so they vent their spite on me

  he got captain macnairs permission
to search the crews quarters again and
asked me to go with him he was so dis-
turbed over panamas loss that we all
humored him when he began opening the
gunny bags that the chinks kept their be-
longings in i said you dont expect to find
her in there do you

   no he said panama is gone but
i thought maybe they might have kept her
collar if i should find her collar i would
know that they killed her

  but he didnt find the collar

  he brooded over the loss of that dog
for three days and on the third day at
supper nobody having mentioned the dog
he broke out suddenly you men think its
queer my feeling so badly over losing a
dog

  he said it tensely accusingly as if we
had been blaming him for his sorrow over
the animals death he looked defiantly at
captain macnair and went on

  but it isnt the dog i care so much about
as her collar i can tell you now that pigeon-
blood stone in her collar was a ruby some
archeologists are excavating an inca tem-
ple over in northern chile a peon found
that ruby and ran away with it it worked
its way down to the coast where i got hold
of it i dont know what its worth-several
thousand dollars maybe i had planned
to smuggle it into baltimore where you un-
load now you know why i feel so badly
about losing that dog

  toward the end of the speech his voice
lost its vigorous defiance it took on a
complaining tone as if he held us responsi-
ble in some way for his misfortune

  besides myself there were only captain
nacnair the chief engineer and ward at
the table welling the chief officer was
on the bridge and the assistant engineers
were below no one spoke for a moment
my first feeling was one of resentment
against cameron for breaking into our
calm with his innuendos of stolen gems


adventure

  i felt uneasy slightly dismayed next
thing i thought he will be accusing one
of us directly with having killed his dog
for the sake of the jewel his words were
the first discordant note to enter any of our
conversations he had placed us all under
a cloud of suspicion and at that moment
i almost hated him a restraint fell be-
tween us all we who only a moment be-
fore had been confident and trustful were
now self-conscious doubtful of each other

  some men show disapproval by their
silence captain macnair was such a man
no doubt he felt outraged that this cameron
whom he had taken as a passenger as a
personal favor should abuse his hospitality
by planning to smuggle gems into a friendly
country making the melilla as it were a
party to the crime

  cameron continued to look from one to
the other of us but we were too busy with
our own thoughts to notice him i cant
say how long we would have sat there
waiting for something to relieve the situa-
tion had not the chinks chosen that special
moment to start their roughhouse we
heard a shout from welling and a revolver
shot and almost immediately the shutting
down of the engines

  the chief was the first on deck i was at
his heels cameron got in macnairs way
and i heard the skipper cursing like a stoker
the ladder to the bridge was under the
raised deck aft we saw welling standing
at the top of it holding his revolver on the
crew which was packed tight around the
bottom the chinks broke away from the
stairs when they saw us retreating silently
their faces toward us to the maindeck

   my- dont shoot them the chief

yelled were shorthanded now

  we went up on the bridge

   what is it mr welling the captain
asked

   i dont know sir they came running
along the deck shoulder to shoulder like a
pack of wolves i ordered them forward
they paid no heed to me they tried to
rush the stairs and i shot into the air it
looks to me like mutiny sir some of them
have knives

   there are some of my boys there the
chief engineer said i hope they havent
hurt my assistants im going below

   wait a minute chief we dont want
to divide our forces the skipper said

  he leaned over the rail and told the men

to go to their quarters and to send the cook
to the bridge the bosun who could speak
pidgin english looked up and said

   sailor boys wantee rice capn allee
want rice sabe

   tell them the skipper replied that
there is no rice if they will work the ship
to the next port i will get some now go
forward

   officers eat rice capn the bosun said

  i saw a knife or two come out

  macnair turned back to us

   chief he said well start the show
dont shoot men they havent any guns

  the engineer ripped off his coat and
flung it into the wheelhouse he was smil-
ing we went down the stairs reaching
the main-deck we spread out macnair
welling and the chief took the middle
ward and i on the flanks the chinks stood
their ground they had reached that state
of senseless fury when men do unac-
countable irrational things they didnt
know what they wanted to do suppose
they killed us all that wouldnt get them
any rice

  we read a lot nowadays about self-
expression well fighting is a form of self-
expression if those chinks had been we
they might have written a burning letter
to the press declaring that the country was
going to the dogs because they couldnt
have rice then they would have gone
back to their work feeling happy and virtu-
ous not being so effete and sophisticated
they tried to cut us into ribbons with their
knives it was their brutish way of ex-
pressing their grievance

  they seemed to be all there the sixteen
men of the deck crew and the twenty-four
of the black squad as we closed in
several knives flashed up we were out-
numbered eight to one but they couldnt
break our front when we struck them
they gave back slightly but rebounded
those behind reached over those in front
to stick us with their knives or claw our
faces with their vile nails

  i got my first one on the jaw and he went
down i swung again but the second chink
stepped inside the blow and got his arms
around my neck i felt his putrid breath
on my face i gave him my knee below
the belt he went down squealing thrash-
ing on the deck under our feet

  welling fell with a man on top of him
the chief and i closed the gap what the
the mutiny-



first officer did to that chink i dont know
but all the facial surgery in the world
couldnt make that chink look like himself
again when welling got up his nose was
streaming claret and he was berserk he
charged through that squirming mass like

a bat through - but as he turned a

chink rocked him with a blow on the head
and he fell senseless

  you see that scar tansy asked hold-
ing up his left forearm

  i nodded it was like a long white burn
and as wide as a thick pencil

  that saved my windpipe he went on
and ive never regretted it though its
marked me for life

  we were fighting on a line running from
the main hatch to the rail tansy con-
tinued wards flank was protected by
the rail my end was up in the air finally
three or fouu chinks thought to scramble
up on the hatch but it didnt get them
anything if they came close enough to
strike i dragged them down by the legs

  theres no denying it was going hard
with us welling was out of it the
skippers right arm was no longer any good
except as a guard hed got a wicked slash
near the shoulder that severed the muscles
the arm was never quite good after that
the chief engineer was as good as three
ordinary men while his wind held but years
of quiet boozing had rotted his bellows
he was bleeding in half a dozen places and
sobbing for breath ward was the only
one of us who hadnt lost blood but he had
paralyzed his right arm with a swing on
some chinks coco

  i always thought it was a mistake that
we hadnt got our guns first and done a
little shooting nothing breaks the spirit
of a mob like hot lead but it was the old
mans orders not to shoot i am sure
though that he hadnt expected the crew
to put up much of a fight

  five men are no match for forty any
way you look at it and the forty with
knives and as crazy as only an obsessed
chinaman can be they might have got
us im not saying but just as that white-
haired skipper was dragged down by three
insane chinks the assistant engineers bobbed
up the forward companion the way they
tore into those pagans was a caution they
were fresh and every blow knocked a china-
man for a broken nose or a mouthful of
loose teeth

  the chinks broke and scuttled for the
focsle one of them never left the deck till
ward and i heaved him overboard the
chief had killed him with a short-arm chop
below the ear two others crawled away on
all fours but they stoked us into rio

  the captain called a truce then and
cameron patched us up he was some
surgeon he had watched the fight from
the bridge ready to shoot up the rebels if
they gained a distinct advantage over us
he was just going to unlimber he said when
the engineers got into the game

and then began the queerest
sport i ever bet money on ward
and i played it we called it chink-
snatching it consisted of sneaking down
to the focsle grabbing off a chink and beat-
ing it before the others stuck us with their
knives if we got one we turned him over
to the engineers and heaven help him if
he didnt shovel coal great sport while
it lasted but it came to a sorry end before
each raid we would lay wagers with welling
and cameron on our chances of capturing a
chinaman the chinks had to keep the
bulkhead open for air but after we pounced
in on them a few times they learned to set
a guard they wouldnt come out of them-
selves to work the ship too stubborn

  it makes me think of the night raids on
the german trenches over there in the toul
sector was rour division ever there
tansy asked

  no i said but we used to slip across
the marne opposite jaulgonne just before
the germans came across on the fifteenth
and bring back a square-head or two for
our intelligence section to question i know
what you mean it must have been some-
thing like that going down into the fore-
castle expecting them to pass you a grenade
any minute go on

  yes it was something like that tansy
said only we didnt want the chinks for
any information we could get out of em
just wanted them for fire-room work first
time down we got two that was because
we took them so by surprize after ten or
a dozen raids we got enough to fire one boiler
with a shift

  and then we learned that the chinks
were sneaking up on deck at night for water
and we began stalking them that was how
ward got killed and that put an end to
chink-snatching


adventure

   it was the second night after the mutiny
we were getting close to rio and the skipper
said he might turn off the crew there and
get a white crew

  well ward and i were down on deck
laying for a chink it was quite dark we
thought we saw a shadow come up the
companion it vanished going aft

   you take the starboard side ward
whispered

  the chink went up the port side ahead
of ward turned across under the bridge
and came down my side i couldnt under-
stand what he was after just prowling i
suppose i was crouching close to the rail
and when he came opposite i grabbed him

    ive got him ward i said one more
for the stokehole

  but ward didnt answer i took the
chink below and turned him over to the
engineer on duty

  i wondered about ward and returned
to the deck and began looking for him i
found him face down on the main-deck
he had been stabbed through the neck from
behind and must have fallen just as i
grabbed that chink because i didnt hear
him hit the deck a second chinaman must
have come up and stalked ward while he
was stalking the first man

  wards death made us all pretty blue
the skipper didnt say much to me about
it but to welling he seemed to assume that
 was to blame for the second officers death
which was rather strange because it was
ward who proposed the chink-snatching
and was so keen about it i missed him
more than icare to say

when we got to rio the skip-
per turned the crew over to the
authorities charging them with
mutiny and murder we made our deposi-
tions shipped a white crew replaced some
machinery parts and sailed for baltimore

  but something happened there at rio
that puzzled the skipper and me for months
i cant explain it all yet

  learning that we were getting rid of
the chinese crew cameron decided against
going on to baltimore with us he was con-
fident that the chinamen had the big ruby
so he was going to stop in rio for a while to
see if he could recover it the day that the
brazilian authorities took the chinamen

ashore he asked if he might search the crew
before they left the ship the captain
couldnt well refuse the request though
none of us had felt the same toward camer-
on after he told us that he intended to
smuggle the ruby into the united states
so when the crew lined up on deck with
their baggage he went through them even
made them remove their shoes

   of course he didnt find the jewel but
after he had gone ashore i went down to
the focsle to look at the ports and there
sticking out from under a gunny-sack away
up in the peak i saw an end of panamas
collar dragging it out i found the ruby
still in its setting later following up a
suspicion of mine i found some bones in
the ash-pit in the galley that certainly were
not beef bones

   the skipper and i concluded that the
chinks tiring of eating burgoo had killed
and eaten panama the cook probably
saved the collar because of its gaudy pretti-
ness of course he didnt know its value
or he would not have discarded it he had
doubtless planned to carry it away with
him till he learned that he was under arrest
then fearing that possession of the collar
would complicate matters for him he hid
it hastily where i found it

   for a long hour the skipper and i de-
bated what to do with it finally deciding
that the only right thing was to return it to
cameron i spent the most of three days
on shore looking for him but he seemed to
have vanished

   when i went to see the captain a year
later at leith he still had the ruby but was
anxious to sell it for anything it would bring
as he needed money i agreed and we made
a trip to london where we got three hundred
and fifty pounds for it i took a hundred
and fifty and made him keep the two
hundred

   tansy sighed

   if i had all that money now but i had
a smoking good time while it lasted

   so he concluded it isnt the army i
think about now when i eat rice its
nitrates i think of and burgoo and that big
ruby that panama wore on her collar and
engine-trouble and the mutiny with the
crazy chinks crawling all over us and slash-
ing us with their wicked knives those were
the days
author of the swordsman emperor of the dragons etc

    here we sit in a branchy row

   thinking of beautiful things we know
   dreaming of deeds that we meant to do

   all complete-in a minute or two-

   something noble and wise and good

   done by merely washing we could

   weve forgotten but-never mind

    brother thy tail hangs down behind

road song of the bandar-log

o	be called green is bad enough
but to be christened a monkey as
well-a monkey that is green a
green monkey one might imagine
that was almost too much

  however in monas case the green
was less than skin deep a mixture of
black and yellowish hairs on his back gave
him that greenish appearance his under-
parts as well as his fine brushed back side-
whiskers were a rich orange any beast could
be proud of as also a narrow forehead-band
for the rest he was black-skull-cap face
hands and feet all black black too ac-
cording to all who had dealings with him
was his heart certainly black was his
scowl-his scowl that would not rub off
finally he taped about eighteen inches
and had a tail just as long besides

   not that mona had always been ebon of
expression and character so to speak in
his youth he knew irresponsible fun and
frolic as irrepressible as many such did now
in the troop that he led he had only be-
come soured with age like many who are
not monkeys the result of too often finding
himself done or left and too seldom

right-if one may so put it the result
too of being considered good to eat by so
many of the wild kindred besides-well
what would you he was the leader of a
troop of monkeys surely that was excuse
enough for anything-forty and four
monkeys mark you

  mona dropped twenty feet through the
top branches of the towering wild-fig tree as
if he were going to commit suicide and have
done with it casually he hooked out a
long black hand caught a clinging rope-
like liana swung reswung and came to
anchor in a sitting position upon a big
bough beside a young male monkey of his
own ilk

  the latter had been at business with
something and now hastily with absurd
expressions of fear tried to cover the fact
up mona stood up slid one skinny hand
under the chin of the other from behind
jerked the latters head upward and back-
ward and gave him one long diabolical look
deep down into his eyes from above only
one look mind you but it was enough
that young citizen of monkeydom removed
not slowly very very quietly and without
saying a word leaving behind him the half
of a banana that he had evidently so much
prized as to hide mona finished it in con-
templative silence as one who had the right

  thereafter mona scratched peered round
under his scowling ridged brows with some-
thing of the quickness of a bird and all but
the calculating intelligence of a man and
walked off with his peculiar flat-footed


adventure

high-rumped gait to where the swish and
sway of leaves below hinted that some
members of his troop were enjoying them-
selves

  from branch to creeper vine to bushy
twig tendril to main trunk he dropped
and swung and slid and sprang as easily as
a man going down his own stairs and ten
times more gracefully

  he beheld a group of the younger genera-
tion of green monkeys-absolutely efferves-
cing with mischief and fun-greatly ex-
cited over plunder in the shape of bananas
they were stealing-in stealthy rushes--
from a planted clearing in the forest down
below and mona might so far have for-
gotten himself as to grin at the thought
that the risk-every moment a monkey
spends in the open is a risk-should be
theirs but the spoil-which he now
prepared to take from them-was going
to be his it was characteristic how-
ever of the old ruffians almost cautious
cunning that he should first glance up-
ward

  then-then he fell clean sheer and
instantly off his perch down through the
branches with a swishing crash as if he had
been shot

fsfisj a dour and silent beast at all
tfcajrj times mona did not say anything at
all-then no need perhaps all
knew that crash and its meaning every
monkey in sight leaped or dived for cover as
if each were a portion of a single exploding
shell and mothers gathering up little
ones to their breasts sprang with one
hand and two feet as surprisingly nimble
or apparently as nimble as the rest with
all four

  now if you had been standing anywhere
within a quarter of a mile of that spot you
could scarce have failed to hear a rushing
noise in the air looking up you would
have beheld as it were a mighty barb fall-
ing out of the brazen sky that barb was a
living one and if it had continued its head-
long dive earthward to its logical conclusion
it would have precisely struck in its course
and that exactly on the back of the neck one
crusty old cunning old green monkey
named mona if- exactly

  mona as we know held other views as
to the use of the back of his neck than as a
perch for a tearing rending tiger-clawed
martial crested eagle which was the name

this living barb sailed under really he
mona bother our language had also as
we know flung himself to the ground-
about the only time in his life that he re-
garded actual terra-firma with anything but
deep suspicion-and though there was noth-
ing to prevent the eagle from continuing its
dramatic plunge to him there mona knew
very well she would not

  the eagle in fact suddenly produced at
the last moment great round wings checked
herself instantly just when it seemed too
late-and that was magic enough indeed-
and swept away in one direction on one
grand masterly curve while mona bolted
for the nearest tree in the other direction
the eagle would have dashed herself to
pieces else but her thin scream was vibrant
with rage and a warning to mona con-
cerning the future

  monas passage treeward was consider-
ably accelerated by a little lean lithe
jackal ever ready to chase or to fly a snap-
per up of unfortunates an attender of the
dead

  fortunately for mona however that pre-
cise corner of the dark continent knew
two kinds of jackals unlike as could be
and this one was so to say the other kind
the side-striped one had it been mesome-
las of the silver-black back monas long
tail would have been snapped off long ere
he reached that tree-acacia aribica of the
vile five or six inch thorns it was-where-
on sitting in the prickliest part of one of the
prickliest trees in a land of prickles he made
demon grimaces at the open-mouthed
jackal below and the martial eagle now
waiting on like a floating mote on the
eve above and back again

  mona stamped his hands presently when
the jackal loped away and still more at the
patient deadly speck floating in wide circles
overhead because it would not go away
his patience was the patience of all the
monkey folk-nil his temper short as his
own memory yet it did seem absurd
that in the end a glossy self-confident
bird no bigger than a starling whose
name was drongo shrike should turn up
and drive the mighty eagle from that
vicinity

  escaping thence from that tree crab
fashion by reason of those thorns afore-
mentioned mona half an hour from his
hurried entry into same sought his very
own but by no means loving flock
the green devil



       he was fully aware the while as
his hurry attested that if either of
 his besiegers came back and caught
him on the hop so to speak they would
have handed him out death quick as a snow-
flake melts outside a pastry-cooks shop
monkey meat being as the saying is in the
wild everybodys meat-some compare it
to chicken others to veal-and monkeys
absolutely refusing to mind their own busi-
ness and trying to play man with only the
glimmerings of a soul to do it upon as they
do monkeys you will note find the wild
world hard and cruel

  by what form of semi-human reasoning
mona followed and found his fickle com-
panions i do not profess to understand
certain it is however they did not help
him for as happens so often what had
been precocious smartness sharpness cheek
intelligence mischief roguery sleight and
light of finger exaggerated nimbleness of
body and mind all but human intelligence
foiled by more than childish waywardness
forgetfulness fitfulnes uncertainty pettish-
ness overaffection absurd affectation in
youth had in age developed into smolder-
ing red-hot temper cunning bullying blus-
ter selfish sullen wicked spite

  certain it is too mona did not trail by
scent-he who like all monkeys probably
could do little more with his nose than man
himself but he knew where they had gone
and he went there and the manner of his
going was sufficiently startling for anybody

  difficult it is to estimate his speed ex-
cept to be sure that it was considerable
difficult also to picture to you that
amazing gait of his the flying aerial march
of all the monkeys when they travel which
must be seen to be understood

  never once did he touch ground never
once check never once falter or pause in his
long flying dives from forest spire to mid-
level in his unerring aim at tendril or vine
or across the giddy spaces in his almost
rocket-like ascents to the overworld of the
forests green roof again quick nearly as his
sensational descents in his dizzy leaps and
almost as dizzy tight-rope gallops along
lianas suspended between heaven and earth
in his faultless trapezing his effortless
vaults athwart the green cliffs-his calm
his perfect balance made possible i feel
sure by his long tail which though not a
prehensile fifth hand in the sense that the
tails of south african monkeys are never-

theless more than paid for its board and
lodging so to speak by making mona al-
most everything in the air short of a bird

  more amazing even could it have been
more apparent more startling had it not
been glossed over in such a natural matter-
of-fact way was the manner in which with-
out fear mona encountered and eluded
danger such close calls would have
made a mans hair curl for half a day and
have shattered his nerve for a week if
they affected the monkey at all it was but
a passing phase and scarce noticeable so
it is often in the wild and makes the wild
creatures so hard to understand the scene
so bare to unseeing eyes of episode

  as thus when negotiating a vine at full
speed mona found that one foot ahead it
ceased to be a vine and became a green tree
snake the sheer fall into vacuity to avoid
this horror was no more startling in its un-
hesitating instantaneousness than in the al-
most magic facility with which a bush-rope
forty feet below was selected caught hold
of and swung from to the next as again
when remembering almost always to-

lend no rotten bough thy strength

-one such snapped beneath him as he
plunged headlong into a forested ravine but
recovered by changing hands on another
branch almost without a check in his stride
as again too when a bateleur eagle red of
face and claw and heart slid along with
him as he crossed the surface of that ap-
parently endless green sea that represented
the primeval forest roof

  in this case the unhesitating side step
to a red and waxen blossom that collapsed
under his weight as in turn he left it for a
mass of draped and bearded lichen which
crumbling beneath him left him dodging
round a tree-bole there to vanish utterly
because clapped against the bark frozen
he became once momentarily hidden
merely merged into his motionless green
surroundings

when mona finally sighted his
fickle flock they were on the edge of
one of those large clearings in the
otherwise unbroken impenetrable except for
elephant paths primeval forest for which
no one has ever yet been able to account
he came straight from more than religious
gloom among the towering columnar jun-
iper trunks under the wondrous unbroken
o

adventure

green canopy of gigantic branches interlaced
for miles into white-hot blinding sunlight
and it made him blink but he saw instant-
ly that since it had left him probably for
dead it had amalgamated with another
troop making a band now nearly a hundred
strong instead of about fifty

  it was that hour the hottest most glar-
ing of the twenty-four when all nature is
silent gasping or asleep only the rustle
of a resplendent banded trogan on a branch
fluttering his wings in defiance of the molten
sun and very far away up the slope a
sound unspeakably eery in its strangeness
as if the very wood gods themselves were
playing long-drawn ringing notes upon the
rims of giant glasses broke the utter still-
ness-the constantly repeated cry of some
hornbill possibly on guard near his tree-
bolenest but how can i tell you howwith
hard cold machine-made pen make you see

  there is a glamor about the wonderland
of the african primeval forest through
which one walks like a little child through
fairyland every turn revealing fresh mar-
vels every glance giving up beauty hitherto
unthought of every vista disclosing secrets
almost beyond our dreams

  it was characteristic of mona and his
deep suspicion of all things-warranted
enough it may readily be-that he took
good care to see before being seen typical
of him personally that while furtively
scowling every way around with his quick
almost bird-like sharpness he should creep
closer and closer to the monkey troop feed-
ing upon beans planted-it was base exag-
geration to call it cultivated-by some
natives in the clearing a few individuals
were at business too with the fallen fruit-
marula apples perhaps-under a tree on the
edge of both forest and crops

  from his final unseen perch in this latter
tree mona looked down upon the green
backs of the feeders below it is quite
possible for monkeys to be conscious of
wrong-doing those out among the crops
were very much on the alert those be-
neath the tree not so much so

  these latter numbered five-two old
females concerned as to the welfare of
babes in arms whose eternal look of tired
surprize mona could see quite plainly as
they clung to their mothers breast upside
down two gamboling very young males
and one young female in her prime her
the old reprobate watched

  but as he watched he fed and as he fed he
wastefully let fall as monkeys and many
birds do much of that fruit he plucked
used perhaps to the falling of fruit as much
through birds as by natural growth those
below began to pick up what mona let fall
gradually all five were directly beneath
him till suddenly the fact seemed to strike
the semi-human intelligence of the brute for
the first time

  filling his cheek pouches and having
eaten his fill mona did not stop gathering
fruit but continued dropping each handful
thoughtfully and watching with old-man-
like wrinkled brows the squabbling that
began to take place over his largesse
gradually as he picked fruit he soundless-
ly stealthily let himself down

  his arrival dropping like a stone among
them on the heels of the last handful was as
unexpected as it was dramatic nor did he
give them any time for recovery

  it has always seemed to be a matter for
remark that those wild folk who are most
ruthlessly persecuted by their neighbors
should themselves be the most ruthless to
their own kind take our own rabbit as a
case in point so it was with mona

  his venomous dart at the nearest young
male monkey his vicious bite that left a red
flank gash followed as instantly by his re-
bounding like a rubber ball to the second
his cuffs at the mothers-quick as a snakes
stroke they seemed-and before all four
had vanished scampering in terror his
remorseless galloping drive of the young
female before him up into the towering
foliage that flanked the clearing round like
cliffs of riven obsidian was all as unneces-
sarily merciless as it was amazingly quick

half-way up a giant juniper
mona stopped to peer down and
back his abduction of his young
bride-a member of the other troop by the
way-was one thing his power to hold her
against the wrath to come another he
saw the leader of the other troop a very
fine young male green monkey in his prime
come racing over  the ground in the blinding
sunlight saw him swarming up the great
tree-trunk at a hand-gallop and without a
check and knew that he had absconded
with that leaders favorite

  swiftly he turned and drove the female
before him still upward and ever up as if
he would seek the very forest spires she
the green devil



would have broken back had she dared but
the expression on old monas black face was
diabolical and no thing to trifle with

  suddenly he stopped suddenly they
both stopped a very peculiar and eery
sound was emanating from the dense mass of
foliage at the great trees summit where the
mighty branches reaching always upward
for the light found it at last and spread
out in a dense tangle on all sides inter-
twined with creepers and the branches of its
neighbors it was as though the very gods
of the forests themselves were perched aloft
there crooning the songs of the primeval
woods

  muruh-muruk-muruh-rrrrmuh - rrrrmuh-
viuruh quoi-quo-quo-quo-rrrr  now rising and
swelling in weird chorus now falling and
dying away like the moan of the sad wind
it rang through the woods as uncanny a
chant as was ever listened to by demon
lover in enchanted halls

  it was as a matter of fact the song of a
party of colobus monkeys whose beautiful
long black-and-white slashed fur and tails
could now be seen on the overworld roof of
the forest moving to and fro above

  mona dashed ahead was as promptly
met by the old male leader of the handsom-
est of all the monkeys with bared teeth and
warning abuse turned and dashed a little
way down again the path was barred but
that feud could wait the other could not

  one has heard the saying red-hot devils
often enough perhaps but this this battle
that followed on the roof of the forest be-
tween the two rival leaders of the green
monkeys was the thing itself in the very
flesh by the same token it is hopeless
to describe it properly mind up there
in that dizzy place there was no room for
error-a slip a false step meant one clean
abysmal dive of at least one hundred feet
and a crumpled death upon the black moist
earth below

  nor was the fight like unto the fighting
of other beasts half-human half-animal it
was wholly demoniacal in the vicious
short lightning chops with the yellow teeth
the frenzied clinches the snake-twist
breaks away the tense wrestles the fiend-
ish worrying the coughing curses-in
everything except actual fact it was the

little beasties of the wild at all

  the younger beast had the agility of his

opponent had too maybe slightly the

  

strength over him but not the devils own
cunning that lived back of the smoldering
bloodshot orbs of old mona

  suddenly the old villain wrenched at his
opponents tail the other as suddenly
chopped round to break that hold cut his
thin knuckles to the bone but for one
briefest fraction of time that twisting bite
left the younger animals throat open to the
foe and mona was there-both black
gripping vice-like hands and all cutting
teeth -he was there quick as light

  back swayed the younger inch by tense
forced foaming inch inch by clutch-
ing choking toppling inch then-over-
down

  for half a dozen awful seconds they hung
-and swung-mona alone holding a creep-
er which was life with his right foot
wrenching the clutching black hands away
that clung to him biting the fingers that
held then-ah

  a scream a falling streak a crash as the
younger monkey shot through some climb-
ing fern a marvelous clutch swing drop
crash clutch swing again and the soft thud

mona sick and giddy pulled him-
self up swayed coughed and drove
his new mate before him in the wake
of the now fast disappearing monkey troop
to a safer place

  night swiftly marching over the tree-
tops caught him suddenly as night does in
those parts before he could recover suffi-
cient strength to overtake the hurrying
double troop

  torn and red and weak his sure cunning
still held however and he chose a nights

nesting pigeon and when she faced around
to retaliate he stole her eggs he put his
hand into a hole and brought out a young
woodpecker it the two devoured they
finished with nuts

  huddled together they faced the hours
of dreadful night ere the extraordinary
squeak chorus of the hyr ax had ceased-those
amazing dwarf-hoofed animals which ran
about the trees like squirrels-they heard the
hair-raising persistent screaming that tells
of monkeys being harassed by leopards
and mona knew how the troop bereft of his
cunning leadership had chosen an evil
camping-place and suffered they heard

ago charley file grew too
r bronco peeling and moved
town where he accepted a
on at the palace livery
stable there he has curried and fed and
saddled horses for dudes ever since with but
one real vacation that was the time he
returned with his car

  and such a car a thing of wondrous
lines and power of yellow-leather uphol-
stery of gold-plated robe-rail and beveled
plate glass of nickled wheels and massive
tires and an engine-well old charley file
boasts of ninety thoroughbreds corraled
under the hood of his car and his speed
seems to prove it he has fitted up a stall at
the palace as a sort of garage and spends
his spare moments tuning up his wonder-
car

  it all began when old charley went into
the isis to see victor vyne in heartbeats
and saddle-leather the picture had
flickered off two reels of its lively footage
before charley realized that the lithe figure
of the principal character was familiar a
few moments more and old charley was
stealing softly from the darkened interior
of the isis

  his reason for leaving was simple he

had discovered that victor vyne the movie
hero was vic tipps victor vyne at that
moment enlivening the isis screen in heart-
beats and saddle-leather was old vic
tipps

  it was then that charley file determined
to take a vacation his procedure was
straightforward he simply went to the
proprietor of the palace livery and an-
nounced he was going away for two or three
weeks

  an hour later aboard a train bound for
los angeles he sat back in his seat con-
tentedly so vic tipps had made himself
into one of these here movie actors charlie
mused well if vic was a movie star hed
likely have a lot of money and if vic
tipps had a lot of money-well old charley
knew how to get it away from him

  that is he could if vic hadnt changed
anyway it was worth taking a little trip
to find out for charley needed money
old charley file always needed money

  people had wondered in prescott what
had become of vic tipps theyd known
vic well ten years ago and some of them
had lost a valued source of income when
vic left as he did-suddenly on the day
prescott staged her first cowboy contest
same old vic



  prescotts first cowboy contest was to be
a big affair a purse of one thousand dollars
was to be divided among the bronco busters
which was pretty good money ten years ago
contestants entering the steer-roping the
bulldogging and other events were equally
well provided for

 cowboys had saved for months to be
assured of sufficient entry-fee money vic
tipps was punching cows at forty a month
in those days and he came into town the
day before the contest with one months pay
and an overweening desire to enter in about
fifty dollars worth of events that is he
craved to take part in the bronco busting
the same requiring a preliminary putting-
up of twenty cash dollars as an entry fee

  too he was eager to compete in the
roping of the steers which meant the put-
ting-up of another twenty then there was
the little matter of bulldogging vic was
fully as anxious to display his skill and win
the reward in that line of endeavor-ten
dollars entry fee

  vic thought he knew a way by which he
could increase his forty to an amount that
would cover those entry fees and pay cur-
rent expenses as well and he had brought
with him certain ivory cubes with which
to accomplish that end

  two hours after his arrival in prescott
he had nine dollars left he wooed fortune
on the floor at the palace livery

  if you fellasd quit ropin me inta your
crap games vic complained bitterly id
have some chancet in this country

  it was jist accidental charley file
was cheerfully wrapping his share of the win-
nings in a tobacco-sack jist accidental
why even loaded dice wont roll right
for me mourned vic im gonna leave
this country some day an go where nobody
dont know me im gonna cut out crap-
shootin an quit losin all my money for
three years straight ive lost forty dollars
a month to you fellas

stay with us a while longer charley
urged thingsll begin rollin yer way
pretty soon mebby youll win it all back
no more for me declared vic ill
never shoot again im quits

  i hate to see yuh quit admitted old
charley an i think if somebodyll jist
say fade me cowboy an roll out a pair
jaihll crawl a mile on yer hands and knees
to accommodate im

  not no more

  vic shook his head solemnly

  i have quit q-u-i-t quit here i got
nine dollars left where do i get twenty
to put up for the bronc-ridin wheres any
ten for bulldoggin wheres any twenty
to enter the ropin i had it-er some of it
anyhow now look at me

  vic counted his money gloomily

  nine dollars yah

  squatting on his heels charley file
counted out nine silver dollars

  shoot yuh all or any part of it he
stated flipping out a pair of yellowed dice

  vic tipps flopped to his knees

  shoot four bits he snapped grabbing
the dice

  old charley quit while vic still had three
dollars but three dollars even in the hands
of a genius cant last and vic was a
genius he must have been or he couldnt
have borrowed a dollar and forty cents from
old charley but he got it and then
worked all day among his friends gathered
for the contest and by night was reported
to have gleaned eight dollars and forty cents
total

  desperately in need of money for his
entrance fees vic evolved a plan that would
bring him huge sums it was so easy he
wondered that no one else had thought of it
a carnival company was in prescott that
week replete with contrivances eager to
supply cash to whoever was in need vic
simply planned to win some of their money

  gas flares lit up the busy wheels clicking
off lucky numbers loud voices urged
one and all to buy a paddle and receive a
huge cash reward for fifty cents you
could win fifty dollars at the wheels theyd
even pay you a dollar if you knocked three
stuffed tomcats off the perch at three balls
fr a dime

  roulette roulette bawled a human
fog-horn real money you get you win
fifty dollars for fifty cents

  that sounded good to vic tipps he
hurried right up to the brightly lighted
counter

  gimme a paddle and he laid down
fifty cents

  ten numbers were on his paddle others
crowded up and bought paddles until it
seemed some one was bound to win thats
the way the proprietor wanted it to seem
but somehow the luckiest numbers were
strangely reluctant to register vic won a
huge box of candy which upon being opened


adventure

proved to contain but a very few pieces
of very ancient candy

  however there was that fifty dollars to
be given to the holder of the paddle bearing
that number-provided the wheel stopped
at that number-and vic tried it again and
again once with four paddles until it
dawned upon him that the possibility of
one certain number showing up on a wheel
bearing more than two hundred is not very
potent reluctantly he relinquished his
paddle to another eager to win the fifty

  were shooting dice boys

  a lovely lady cast bright glances at the
passing throng idly she cast four dice from
a leather cup

  twenty-five dollars if you throw four
sixes or four fours

  vic shied at this dice had been his
hobby-and his downfall he knew the
difficulty of producing the combination
necessary to collect the twenty-five

  but even as he thought the beautiful
lady cast the dice from her cup on the
green velvet four sixes stood in a row vic
tipps was astonished he hadnt believed
such a thing possible he paused

  try your luck cowboy

  the lady held out the leather cup in-
vitingly

 a dime ten cents wont make you
nor break you twenty-five dollars if you
get four sixes or fours you win a prize
for every pair

  she indicated the collection of gold-wire
and shell jewelry decorating the back and
sides of her booth

  vic tipps stepped closer

  try it once cowboy urged the dulcet
tones

  the lady shook the cup and rolled out-
four fours

  vic laid down his dime he got a pair
of fives for that he won a shell stick-
pin the pin was quite lovely in the bright
light of the flares and vic was thinking he
could sell it for at least a quarter but it
crushed in his fingers as he pressed it into
his neckerchief

  still with his own eyes he had seen the
lady throw four sixes and then four fours
he argued with himself that possibly the
dice were fixed to fall that way once in
every so often so as to stimulate trade
that sort of figuring cost him a dollar more
for with the desire to win the twenty-five
strong within him he made ten valiant at-

tempts to duplicate the ladys feat he left
the booth with a half-dozen shell ornaments
dangling from his shirt bosom

  he felt that if hed just won that lucky
number on the wheel or had the dice fallen
right he might even now be carrying fifty or
a hundred dollars the thought cheered
him having eaten nothing since noon he
stopped at a savory lunch-stand and de-
voured a sandwich and cup of coffee worth
possibly fifteen cents-it cost forty

  a sloping table baize covered spread with
bills and coin next caught the attention of
vic tipps a rope held back the eager
players who with rings at three for a
quarter were allowed to carry off whatever
they could encircle with their rings

  vic hastily finishing his meager lunch
hastened over when he learned his throw-
ing hand could almost touch the fortune
littered table nothing on earth could have
stopped him from investing in three rings

  he aimed at the twenty-dollar gold-piece
reposing in the center of the collection the
slant of the table was deceptive and two
of his rings fell aimlessly but the third
encircled a penny this was an omen of
good fortune and vic took another quarters
worth of rings

  he still had four dollars left in his pocket
when he gave it up he was becoming
vaguely alarmed it seemed his luck had
gone back on him or something this
wasnt easy money

  here yare here yare here yare
howled a voice here yare here yare
here yare battling lucas the cowboy
middle-weight gives one hundred dollars
to any one staying four rounds any weight
up to a hundred an sixty come on up
boys free admission to anybody wholl
put on the gloves with battling lucas

  if boxing had been strychnin vic tipps
could have eaten all he knew about it and
it wouldnt have hurt him a bit still here
was something free-with a golden chance
to earn one hundred dollars whether or
not he could stay four rounds with this
battling lucas wasnt to be considered
he could try vic had been in some pretty
stiff fights besides that hundred would
admit him to the roping the bronc-riding
the bulldogging and numerous other events
on the morrow

  moreover this was free no fifty cents
or quarter or dime was being demanded to
try his luck this was a fair opportunity
same old vic



to win one hundred dollars merely by stay-
ing four rounds-whatever they were-with
somebody named battling lucas this was
surely worthy of due consideration vic
resolved to go in and win

  a crowd was coming out of the fighting-
tent evidently a bout had just been con-
cluded a man in ring togs took his place
under the punching-bag on the platform by
the entrance and set the bag drumming
expertly

  battling lucas gives a hundred dollars
to any weight up to a hundred an sixty
who stays four rounds bellowed the an-
nouncer to the crowd that was assembling
to witness the bag-punching free ad-
mission to anybody who puts oh the gloves

 vic tipps waited no longer he even
f eased some one else might step in ahead of
him and get the hundred he stepped for-
ward

 want to box queried the announcer

  vic nodded and swallowed nervously

 all right come up on the platform-
here with me the announcer indicated a
place beside him

  as vic mounted the steps he noted with
pleasure that the man at the punching-bag
was almost a foot shorter than himself

 the announcer had been busy and a
stream of spectators was straying within
the tent when all the live ones had sought
admission and another candidate or two
had joined vic they were shunted inside
the bag-puncher vaulted into the ring and
vic was boosted up with him the crowd
commented freely

 vic removed the ornaments from his
shirt and placed them carefully in his
pockets meanwhile glaring balefully at his
opponent a pair of big practise gloves
were laced on his hands by two seconds who
plied him with hoarse advice most of which
consisted of urgings to rush in and slug his
opponent off his feet

  as the gong sounded vic following the
advice leaped to the center of the ring
he even felt he was destined to win the
bout and the hundred

  vic tipps did his best but things hap-
pened rapidly that first round it developed
that battling lucas was just as eager to
defend that hundred as vic was to win it
and a lively scrimmage marked the opening
for tlus remainder of his ring debut vic
tipps was battling for his life but battling
lucas was a merciful young gentleman and

having other applicants awaiting their turn
at -the hundred he simply tipped mr tipps
over the ropes 

  kind hands assisted vic to his feet and
removed the gloves friendly strangers
brushed him off and sympathetic voices
urged him to remain for the other bouts
but vic had enough another hundred had
gone glimmering

   without the tent it occurred to vic to feel
in his pockets his money was gone so
was the shell jewelry-and his tobacco
his pockets were all empty vic saw red
good thing battling lucas hadnt met him
in any such mood as this he circled aim-
lessly a while then started glumly for the
palace livery where he had his bed-roll
it was getting late and the crowd was
thinning

pjv i beg your pardon

mg a voice at once kindly but au-
thoritative caused him to look
around he beheld a pretty young lady-
 very severely tailored and business-like
young lady vic remembered her as one
he had seen earlier in the evening pinning
bright bits of ribbon inscribed in gilt pres-
cott cowboy contest

   vic had side-stepped her then because the
recipient of the ribbon was supposed to
ante fifty cents to the enterprising young
lady vic hadnt thought it worth fifty
cents but now he waited

  i beg your pardon repeated the young
lady coming up to him but i saw you
come out of the battling lucas tent and i
just wanted to ask you if-if they robbed
you in there

  you bet they did maam vic replied
convincingly at the same time wishing he
could say the word ask like she said it
like a sweet fairy saying awsk they
stole every dang thing i had

  oh thats too bad she exclaimed with
quick sympathy theyre a hard bunch
in there

  quickly resuming her business-like air
she took on a tone of authority

  i am one of the owners of this carnival
company and it is the purpose of the
management to eliminate all such pocket-
picking and unfair games we can not
afford to allow our patrons to leave the
grounds feeling they have been robbed so
if you will kindly state the amount you have
lost i will make it up to you now and


adventure

compel the lucas crowd to reimburse me
or get off the lot

  hows that

  vic was beginning to doubt any one could
be so generous too he was wondering if
here wasnt his chance to secure the needed
entry money

you say youll pay me back what money
ive been robbed out of here this evenin
on behalf of the management i will
return to you whatever was taken while in
the lucas tent

fifty dollars vic lied anxiously
fifty dollars they got from me in there
he assumed a defensive attitude ex-
pecting that of course she would nail so
palpable a misstatement

  immediately and without offering a
single objection the young lady briskly
drew out a roll of bills vics breath came
faster as he viewed the large denominations
represented therein she selected three
twenty-dollar bills

  here you are she stated crisply as she
handed the three rumpled beauties to vic

  thanks mumbled vic dazedly
thank you maam

  nudging at his hat-brim with his fingers
he turned to go on his way

  but-it was fifty dollars you lost was
it not she reminded him

  oh yeah sure

  vic halted and turned about a couple of

times yeah fifty uh-h-h-

  but i gave you three twenties that is
sixty can you get me the change please
deftly she reached out and removed the
bills from his hands

  im sorry but i havent any small
change with me and i do not wish any of
the other concessionaires to learn that we
are watching them so i will have to ask-
oh how she did say that word-you to
kindly go and get the change from some
of your friends quietly and bring it to me
here in twenty minutes

   all right sighed vic

  he was getting used to seeing money slip
out of his grasp

ill-ill be back i guess i cn--
suddenly a thought occurred to vic tipps
he left the carnival grounds on high
arriving at the palace livery he found old
charley file in charge

  charley can you give me ten dollrs on
my saddle

  uh-hum replied charley throw it

in the office here sos we cn keept locked
up

  the palace was always in need of good
saddles and stood ready to loan small
amounts at any time so as vics saddle
took up its new abode in the security of the
palace office ten dollars passed from
charley file palace representative to vic
tipps a gentleman seeking easy money

  vic waited around almost ten minutes at
the carnival grounds before the young lady
again appeared

  oh youve come back she exclaimed
as if shed thought he was gone for good
then briskly-

  here is the money

  she offered him the three twenties

  thanks breathed vic handing her his
ten much bliged

  you are welcome and she was gone

  sixty dollars vic crumpled the soft notes
in his hand and jammed his hand deep in
his pants pocket sixty dollars true he
had been obliged to pawn his saddle for the
ten dollars change but at that he was
fifty to the good and fifty would enter him
in the riding the bulldogging and the roping

  vic was elated already he heard the
plaudits of the multitude as he would win
all the events on the morrow that he had
secured the money by misrepresentation did
not trouble vic whatever vic was care-
free in those days

  he made his way to the palace hay-loft
and his bed he did not sleep well that
night he tossed about restlessly eager for
the contest tomorrow he felt now and
then beneath his blankets to see if after all
it wasnt just a dream but the folded bills
were always there wonderful good fortune
had befallen him

  now and then some late stayer would
clump noisily up the narrow wooden stair
then would come a rustling of hay and the
scratching on heavy canvas as the new-
comer unrolled his bed followed by grunting
as tight boots were removed and the flare
of a match as with lighted cigaret the dis-
turber retired at each arrival vic almost
rose and shouted of the benefaction of the
carnival management but only the thought
that possibly he might be compelled some-
how to return that part of the money
over and above the four dollars he had
actually lost in the lucas tent stayed his
voice

  at sunrise he stole out and ate a hearty
same old vic



breakfast at a near-by lunch-room offering
one of the twenties in payment

  now at the elite ltinch-counter any bill
over two dollars was regarded with sus-
picion patrons of the elite usually paid
in small change

  the proprietor accepted vics twenty
gingerly he took it to the front window
and bent over it solicitously he shook
his head sadly

  no good he stated languidly passing
the bill back to vic

  no good

  vic hooked his high boot-heels in the
rungs and raised two feet off the stool

 no good why-why see them hairs
in it course its good-

  those hairs are just printed on it en-
lightened the proprietor of the elite

  printed on cant be

  vic peered anxiously at the bill he even
tore a mite off the corner one at a time
he unearthed the other two and subjected
them to the same scrutiny he rumpled
them and blew on them and bit at them
still the fact remained in the light of day
close inspection revealed them counterfeit

  vic was appalled it made him sick at
the stomach he had given ten good dollars
to get those three counterfeit twenties
despairingly he left the counter

  i gotta go borrow sixty cents to pay you
with he explained

  he awoke charley file and negotiated
the loan

 thats two bucks yuh owe me old
charley reminded him dollar forty i lent
yuh yistday an sixty now yuh owe the
palace ten on yer saddle too

  old charleys head was a good ledger

  vic actually went back and paid for his
breakfast that shows how stunned he was
by the discovery that his twenties were
faithless but within the hour he evolved a
plan he would wait until the big rush to
the contest events was on and he would go
in and enter paying with his twenties and
receive ten good dollars in change

  his plan proved feasible there was a
great rush of contestants to get their names
down at about the eleventh hour and vic
was in the midst of the jam the registra-
tion official at contest headquarters was
swamped ropers riders cowboys of all
sorts were in a hurry to get their names
down before the entry books were closed
at noon so it was an easy matter for vic

to make his entries and pay for them with
the three twenties to the official in charge
to whom large bills were accepted as the
usual thing

  vic received a good ten in change then
he left the place he left the crowds and
slipped out to the contest grounds and hid
among the piles of baled hay stored there
for the feeding of the roping-cattle and wild
horses used in the events

  vic tipps heard the grandstand filling
with spectators but he did not look out
from his hiding-place he was uncom-
fortably aware that he had passed counter-
feit money vic expected the sheriff

  he crouched in hiding and heard the band
as it marched through the principal streets
at the head of the cowboy parade but still
he did not show his head he heard the
whooping of the cowboys as they entered
the grounds and the applause of the specta-
tors as the standing roman races swept
around the colorful arena in the opening
spectacle but his ears were all attuned for
the voice of sheriff david or the crunch of
that worthys heavy boot-heel approaching
the bales of hay

  it was not until he heard the voice of the
arena director bronc riders ready
bustin contes next that he ventured
timidly from his nook expecting every
moment to feel the heavy hand of the law
on him he furtively begged the loan of a
saddle from an acquaintance and when his
turn came mounted a tense-muscled black
vic was beginning to hope that his law-
lessness had not been discovered but he
thought he detected sly looks and whispered
words among his friends possibly he rea-
soned it was imagination

  just then his helpers released the black
demon upon which he was seated the
black wheeled clean about squealing and
went off in a series of crooked arching
jumps vic was usually a pretty good rider
but that day he felt himself getting a trifle
behind he could ride to the top of each
leap without difficulty but in the coming
down he found himself arriving there just
a split second after the horse

  as the horse shot back up he met vic
coming down that little collision resulted
in vics going just a bit higher on the en-
suing rise than was his wont and the next
time he came down the bobbing saddle met
him half-way there followed an impact
that could be heard to the nethermost parts


adventure

 of that grandstand then as vics spurs
 clicked together above the saddle-horn there
 was a roar from the spectators through
 which not even the discharge of a french
 seventy-five could be heard

   vic hit the dust so far away from the
 black that it seemed incredible he had ever
 been on the beast at all amid the glee of
 the crowd he scurried around behind the
 corrals and thence to his hiding-place among
 the bales

   well he hadnt been arrested that was
 some relief he thought most likely theyd
 never learn who passed the counterfeit
 twenties vic even went so far as to peek
 over the bales and see some of the other
 boys ride the broncs and by the time they
 got around to the trick and fancy roping
 he was up seated atop the rick enjoying
 the show to the fullest extent

    next event the bulldogging

   the announcers cry came almost wel-
 come to vic tipps with high hopes he
 mounted a borrowed horse and took his
 place one by one he saw others ride out
 and grapple their steers with naked hands
 and throw them

   then all at once he saw sheriff david
 he was conversing with a short stranger
 - and seemed to be looking straight at vic
 but the sheriff was cock-eyed and vic
 couldnt be sure at least he appeared to
 be looking at vic and it was as the cold
 hand of death to vic tipps

    finally his name was called his blood was
  chilled with vague foreboding as he rode out

   the corral gate crashed open and a huge
 red steer galloped forth speeded by two
 whooping hazers the starters flag dropped
 and vic mechanically clapped the spur to
 his eager little cow-pony swiftly he bore
 down upon the plunging steer as his pony
 swept close he leaned out from the saddle
 and caught at the bobbing white horns

    even as he did so he realized all was not
 well now in his hands wet as they were
 with the perspiration of a guilty conscience
 the horns were like two wriggling trout
 it was too late to draw back already he was
 out of the saddle and the pony was whipping
 on past vic clung there a moment clawing
 at the steers face

   like a tramp missing his hold on a box-
 car he slipped down along the steers side
 and went sprawling onto the hard earth
 he heard but dimly the swelling roar of
 laughter from the grandstand as he rolled

over and over then staggering to his feet
he like the steer galloped for the shelter of
the baled hay in the feed-lot

  but vic did not stop at the hay he did
not even pause fear and humiliation sat
hard upon him in his minds eye he still
had a clear picture of sheriff davids weird
eyes peering at him over the shoulder of
the short stranger he knew they were
after him

  giving no thought to his entry in the
coveted steer-roping he hurried onward to
the fence there he vaulted and loped as
rapidly to the railroad yards as high-heeled
boots would permit he had said he would
sometime go elsewhere and he felt that now
was the appointed time

  and ten years later old charley file saw
victor vyne movie-hero in heartbeats and
saddle-leather and recognized in him vic
tipps

old charley had been in cali-
fornia a week before the goings-on
ceased to bewilder him he was
getting accustomed to seeing painted humans
in odd attire dancing-frocks and evening
clothes scurrying about at midday he
had ceased to peer if a troop of mounted
cowboys following a motor truck passed
his door at sunrise or to wonder at a
group shooting pictures in the blaze of elec-
tric light at midnight

  what he had at first supposed to be
splendid hotels proved to be merely res-
idences of these same movie actors at
one of these palatial homes old charley
gazed long and earnestly at the camel in
gay trappings that dozed hitched to one
of the pillars of the front porch at an-
other a beautiful girl four monkeys and a
man who looked like a monkey munched
candies on the rose-fragrant lawn again
charley saw a great automobile with three
seats roll up to the curbing the two
flunkies in the front seat sat stiffly rigid
while the two flunkies in the rear sprang
to the doors to release the two passengers-
a girl who reminded charley of a perky
little squirrel and a dapper male companion
whose face reminded charley of a wizened
walnut-hull they minced loftily across the
few feet that separated the car from the
awninged entrance to their palace

  the homes were growing more imposing
as old charley file hobbled along his high-
heeled boots thudding strangely on the
same old vic



palm-shaded cement walks but he kept
on for he was nearing the home of victor
vyne

  he referred to the scrap of paper he
carried in his hand there could be no
mistake the next place was vics the
great white building with the many porches
the pergolas the castellated chimneys the
awninged and long windowed sun-rooms
the orange-trees and rose-bowered lawn-
this was the home of victor vyne old vic
tipps

  charley files heart beat high as he ap-
proached the place he began to wonder
if his little scheme was going to work after
all his boot-heels clumped oftener and his
high beaver bobbed faster and faster as his
choppy strides bore him toward the palace
on his face was the grim look that used to
be there when in the days of his bronc-
busting youth he was saddling an especially
bad one

  a flight of wide stone steps led to the
terraced lawn at the foot of the steps
stood what charlie mentally catalogued as
a double-barreled automobile it being one
with two wind-shields and but half a top
a uniformed japanese sat at the wheel and
another his duplicate stood at attention
by the door of the tonneau

  down the steps came sniffily two persons
one a girl so delicate of figure and coloring
as to appear made of wax and the other a
gentleman counterpart of the mens cloth-
ing advertisements old charley had seen
in the papers he halted and eyed them
keenly neither deigned to notice him

  howdy

  charley file stepped politely forward

  i hope im not intrudin too much
but t seems like i know yuh aint yuh

ol v-v-

  the words died on old charleys eager
lips the lady had not turned her head nor
changed her expression in the least the
gentleman had moved on exactly as if noth-
ing were being said merely turning his head
slightly in old charleys direction in a stiff
cold stare old charley was chagrined and
at a loss what to do

  a moment more and the couple had en-
tered their car the japanese snapped shut
the door and leaped to his place by the
driver with a muffled whirr the car glided
forward

  old charley file was not one to be lightly
turned aside from his purpose he was

sixty but erect and active his face bore
in a calm unassertive way the stamp of
stubborn patience born of many years
handling obstinate horses just now he
clutched at the silver-plated supports of
the second wind-shield and leaped to the
running-board

  hey aint you vic tipps he blurted
poking his head in under the trim top

  the lady gazed oblivious to the disturb-
ance straight ahead her delicate profile out-
lined sharply-against the velvet lining of the
top old charley wondered if anything
would jar her out of her calm her com-
panion stared vacantly surprized at char-
ley one of the japanese was gliding from
the front seat

  vic tipps demanded charley crisply
has prosperity plumb petrified yer soul
dont yuh know ol charley file

the gentleman seemed about to reply
dont yuh remember prescott charley
snarled an the palace livery stable

where-

  with that old charley hit the pavement
the japanese had done his work well the
big car stopped within four feet and backed
swiftly charley scrambled to his feet

  the door of the tonneau flipped open and
the gentleman leaped out

  of course i remember prescott and the
palace livery stable he was saying i
didnt recognize you charley file

  he lowered his voice

  how-how about it-back there-ah-
about those three twenties

  old charley finished shaking hands before
he replied

  so thats why yuh lit out and never let
us hear frm yuh agin we thought yuhs
ashamed of the way yuh rode that black
an dogged that ox

  i see but was-was anything said

about-about-

   bout them counterfeit twenties shore
plenty sheriff david always did say he
lowed you thought hes after you that day
but he wasnt hed picked up a lady the
goverment detectives said was workin off
queer money an they wanted to see if yuh
could be a witness agin her said th
restrant mans seen yuh with one several
of th- bovs had em but nothin was ever
done but t take it away from m an make
em testifv at the trial

  well ill be-

  vic tipps paused he mused a moment


adventure

 then it was two bucks i borrowed off
 you wasnt it charley

 yep assented charley file two
 bucks and ten on the saddle

 vic tipps drew out two silver dollars and
 a bill

 i want to send back what money i bor-
 rowed from the other boys too

 thanks said old charley accepting
 the money wait a minute

 getting to his knees on the pavement he
 rolled out a pair of well-worn dice

 shoot yuh all or any part of t he
 urged

 vic tipps gentleman flopped to his knees
 ill go you he breathed happily reach-
 ing for the dice

 from the yellow-leather cushions of
 the tonneau came a faint stir the lady
 screamed-a well-bred discreet little
 scream but a scream nevertheless

 good grunted old charley ungallantly
 go ahead vic called to her intent on

shaking the cubes in his cupped hands
well come along later

 the car with almost imperceptible
sound moved off vic tipps and charley
file knelt on the clean pavement the dice
merrily galloping between them

next morning old charley took
his first ride in an automobile the
car was his own and what a car
a thing of wondrous lines and power of
yellow-leather upholstery vic tipps was
showing old charley how to drive it for
it belonged to charley now

  for once in his life old charley had
abandoned the boots and high beaver he
wore the suit vic tipps had worn the day
before on his feet were vics expensive
shoes on his head was vics neat fedora
in his pockets were vics roll watch and
handkerchief-everything the ivories had
been good to charley file

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

we had been thoroughly licked the year before
on long island and the english under
general howe held new york st leger with
regulars and indians was getting ready to pour
down the mohawk and general burgoynes army
had already crossed the canadian frontier intending
to sweep across lake champlain and lake george
to albany

  there seemed little doubt that howe would push
north to join him but there was a doubt

  to help clear up this point general arnold sent
me-sergeant cleve morgan-to new york dis-
guised as ambrose kerry whose relatives madame
betworth and miss audrey betworth had been
captured with their maid betsy osmond in new
jersey where i had been serving under captain sant

  though there was a noose around my neck i
didnt have much difficulty upon reaching man-
hattan in making the acquaintance of captain
saleby a flippant young officer of the king and
paul bowen a sober-minded refugee but i was
disturbed to find that the men i wanted to get in
touch with had vanished berce the most im-
portant was in prison

  at madame betworths the old colored ser-
vant socrates received me without open suspicion
but before i had been there a day i discovered
betsy osmond the maid stealing into the house in
boys clothing-and i believed the game was up
fortunately she did not recognize me in my wig
and silks and through the feather-brained saleby
i was still able to get in touch with berce and
receive this vital information

  philadelphia by fleet

  in delivering the information the patriot berce
was killed and i remained the only living american
who could tell general washington that howe
would not join burgoyne at albany

  but i still had a part to play and i was obliged to
visit howes headquarters with saleby to request a
commission among salebys friends i planned a
party that night at the betworths country place at
bloomingdale which would enable me to make my

escape northward unfortunately i also aroused the
hostility of colonel wentsel of the hessian troops

  this would not have bothered me except that
he informed us the lines had been closed and my
party must accordingly be called off mother baff
the old hag informer who had followed me on my
arrival in manhattan had informed headquarters
of the presence-of an important spy

  my situation was made even more dangerous
by the report that my supposed cousin captain
jasper betworth was expected in the city at any
hour on top of this a note was mysteriously
handed me in the tavern signed by an old comrade
from my owti squad

  git out-bucks

  i went immediately to the betworths house and
found bucks himself waiting for me the reckless
fellow having made his way into the city as a rebel
deserter i told him the news briefly and he went out
to a friends to procure some country clothes for us

  during his absence betsy osmond again appeared
at the house but this time i captured her with
great courage she boldly declared me an impostor-
though she did not recognize me as the colonial
sergeant of the jerseys-and said that the real
ambrose kerry had arrived in new york then
as i tried to recover some papers she had thrown
into the open tire she shot at me knocking off my
wig instantly she cried out

  you you now i know you

  at that moment there came a knocking at the
door out went the lights i was trapped by the
newcomer andfought for my life bucks returned
as i went crashing to the floor betsy osmond had
fled but as a light flashed up we both discovered
that my assailant was our old commander captain
sant-an english spy-and english troops were
already at the door to take us

  all would have been over for us if sant hadnt
rushed out of the room straight into the arms of the
guard mistaking him for me the soldiers beat
him down and dragged him away a prisoner

  we were now in danger of imminent discovery

the white dawn copyright  by hugh pendexter ql
 

adventure

  bucks convinced me that the boldest course was the
  best and we went forth and actually enlisted as
  soldiers of the king

    injun trick said bucks just hiflin where
 theyd never expect to find us

    but though this was true of officials it didnt
  apply to the old witch bali who was still at our
  heels and we discovered further that we had had
  the vile luck of having joined captain sants own
  company just as our ruin seemed certain the old
  woman was murdered by thieves however in our
  present position discovery was inevitable so we
  slipped away and started our perilous escape to the
  northward

    now that we had started open flight the search
 for us became a chase and toward the northern end
 of manhattan among woods and farms bucks and
 i separated several times when on the verge of
 capture i escaped miraculously

    once with the english at my heels i rushed into
 a barn-straight into the arms of the old betworth
 servant-socrates

he sun was up when i crawled
 from the shack and through the
 alders i advanced until i could
 see the post-road there was no
 sight nor sound of horsemen if went-
 sels orders had been carried out there
 would be an ambush a short distance to the
 north where all passers-by would be halted
 did they lack the kings livery

   retreating a dozen rods from the road
 i advanced parallel to it keeping on my
 hands and knees to take advantage of the
 scattering low bushes before i could
 locate any sentinels marking the dead line
 a pistol shot and a womans scream turned
 me back to the hidden shack without
 pausing to reflect it was my duty to save
 myself and thereby do a great service to all
 americans i jumped to my feet and ran to
 serve one american a young woman dressed
 in boys clothes

   when i neared the thicket of alders i
 heard the trampling of horses hoofs and
 the thick guttural cries of a man enraged
 to the point of murder i did not hear the
 womans voice a second time when i
  came into full view of the thicket it was to
 behold colonel wtentsel astride of a plung-
 ing horse a pistol in one hand a sword in
 the other on the edge of the alders before
 the shack and lying face down was the
 body of paul bowen

   from the passivity of his body i knew
 he was dead it was only by following the
 horsemans maneuvers that i discovered the
 maid she had taken refuge in a second
 clump of alders and wentsel was trying
 to force his horse into these the animal

  to my amazement he found me a hiding-place
in the attic of the old mansion as i sat there in
the dark going over events in my mind and figuring
out my chances of reaching kings bridge and es-
caping into westchester two fatigued strangers
were brought mysteriously into the room by
socrates

  we could not see each other and we did not dare
converse-since english officers had taken their
quarters in the house for the night-until it was
almost daylight when we made our way out into
the open as we came into the clear road the first
streaks of day were lighting our way i turned
to look at my companions

  the older was paul bowen the man i had met
when i first came into manhattan that was sur-
prize enough but when i looked more intently at
the other i was staggered

  it was betsy osmond

  betsy osmond also a patriot and a spy to my
own peril was now added the peril that hung over
this brave but exhausted woman

was high-strung and balked each time he
was spurred forward just as i was com-
prehending what had happened wentsel
howled an oath and hurled his long pistol
at the slender figure crouching low behind
the sapling growth then the infuriated
man sent his horse crashing sidewise into
the thicket for a few feet and leaning from
the saddle attempted to slash the terrified
girl with his sword

  i shouted for him to stop his devilish
work he swung his horse about and on
seeing me grimaced like a fiend and jumped
his mount toward me off in the west men
were shouting and i knew it would not be
long before he had reenforcements as he
tore down upon me and slashed at my neck
i ducked and gained the edge of the maids
refuge

  to those not yet in sight he yelled

  come on ive got the whole nest of
them

  i tried to get the girls attention to
penetrate her understanding in an effort
to have her run for it while i kept wentsel
busy but she was so intent on staring at
the form of bowen i doubt if she realized
my presence then i had to shift my posi-
tion as the colonel swept around the thicket
a second holster pistol raised high in place
of the sword i dived behind some berry-
bushes and remembered that i too had
pistols when i came to my feet he was
almost upon me his horse rearing high with
patches of foam flying from his mouth
the colonel fired and i let drive with a high-
land pistol he struck the ground almost
as soon as his rearing chargers hoofs
the white dawn



smacked down i seized the bridle and
fought for a moment to bring the brute
under control

  betsy osmond oh betsy osmond
come come i cried

  even after she had stared at me for a
moment she could not seem to understand
how the brutal colonel could disappear and
morgan the sergeant be standing in his
place

  come i called again

  mr bowen she panted as she crept
from the thicket

  dead i think soldiers are coming

  she trembled violently and sobbed-

  the brute shot him down without a
word shot him from behind

  i know i know i said tossing her
upon the horse hold this beast for a sec-
ond i ran to bowen and searched his
clothing and secured a thick package of
papers and thrust them inside my coat
then i ran to wentsel and secured the
pistol still clutched in his right hand my
bullet had caught him in the middle of his
forehead the cries of the men trying to
locate us now sounded louder leaping
onto the horse i threw an arm around the
girls slim waist and struck out for the
highway

  the cloak she exclaimed tilting her
head to look at me

  she referred to the colonels military
cloak which he had thrown back i was
sitting on it as i worked it out from under
me and got it over my shoulders i noticed
it was wet with dew and i knew he had
been hunting us throughout the night
now i wished i had had time to secure his
hat and boots still in the early morning
the most conspicuous point in our appear-
ance as we dashed into the road was the
long cloak in noticing that one would not
at first observe the lack of boots and proper
headgear

  i praised betsy osmond for thinking of
it even as i was bringing the voluminous
folds about her at a distance we must
have resembled a portly hessian officer bent
on serious business as we clattered along
the highway i saw two groups of soldiers
running from the north and making toward
the shack these would be some of the men
detailed to hold the line from the road to
the jones farm these must have included
all men posted on the road itself for we
were not hailed

  can we ride right through asked the
girl

  only good for part of the way i an-
swered the next moment we were passing
the branch road leading to the harlem
river and three soldiers were springing from
the bushes they recognized the dragoon
horse and noted the military cloak before
i could get at my second pistol and they
instinctively slunk back before they could
gather their wits we were by them they
did not venture to fire until we were nearly
out of range and then their shots came
some seconds apart as if they doubted the
wisdom of their action

  theyll be after us on the road soon
i told her we must quit the horse and
take to whatever cover we can find and
wait till night

  do as you think best she listlessly
replied i am useless i have disgraced
myself

  you are wonderful at the next bend
we will dismount

  ahead was the spire of a church marking
a little village we were nearing a region
of fields dotted with homes of dutch
farmers i pulled the horse down to a walk
and leaped off the girl slid to the ground
we were very open to discovery and my
courage began to weaken from the saddle-
bag i procured a stock of powder and some
bullets for the long pistol also a flask of
brandy the road was empty in both
directions and the shade-trees scattered
along the borders shielded us somewhat
from the gaze of any one abroad in the
fields but once we were sighted it was
a poor place in which to seek cover the
maid studied my face and must have read
despair there for she pointed to a thick
stand of maples at one side the foliage of
which was unusually thick theyll be
looking for us far from the road once they
find the horse she said theyll search
every farm lets get up into the trees

  it was audacious and therefore worthy of
consideration had there been a chance
to double back i gladly would have taken it
after a moments thought i agreed back
on the horse ill lead him under the
branches to save you from barking the
trunk

  soon she was snugly perched in a big
maple with the military cloak folded for
a cushion i led the horse back to the
middle of the road and sent him galloping


adventure

  on down the highway pausing only to
obliterate the hoof marks near the tree
i shinned up into the heart of the foliage
and made a careful selection of a crotched
limb and arranged my belt for a back-rest
we had no food and what was worse all
the wishing in the world wouldnt turn the
bottle of brandy into water

  my first task was to reload wentsels
pistol and my own brace i had barely
finished doing this when betsy clutched my
wrist a dozen mounted men were thun-
dering up the road intent on following the
tracks of the dragoon horse foot-soldiers
would soon be streaming after them i saw
them coming and after they had passed and
had proceeded a bit up the road but when
they were beneath us they were invisible
they were some of the light horse and not
any of wentsels command

  after an hour elapsed we learned that
roosting in a tree is most irksome the
constant fear that some careless movement
might agitate the foliage and advertise our
position and the physical discomfort of
maintaining the same posture became un-
endurable to remain there until night-
fall was utterly out of the question i had
much time to study betsy osmond and
her wan face aroused my deepest pity

  the pathos of her drooping mouth and
the boys clothes made her appear to be
very young and helpless no taller than
a twelve-year-old lad when she spoke it
was in a tremulous whisper i told her we
must change our plans and risk descending
she rewarded my decision with a warm
smile but before i could swing down from
my perch we were startled by the sound of
a bell around the bend at the south
straggled a cow behind her came others
a dozen in all these were driven by
a rustic fully as disreputable in appearance
as i the cattle were inclined to stray from
the road and the cowherds progress was
slow before the herd reached our tree
a company of light infantry came up be-
hind it marching briskly the coming
of the soldiers sent the cattle into the fields
the officer questioned the rustic and was
informed that the cattle were being driven
a few miles beyond kings bridge whereat
he ordered his men to drive them back to
the road this thoughtfulness was not
prompted solely by a desire to accommodate
the cowherd for once the cows were re-
turned the officer wrote on a piece of

  paper and handed it to the rustic saying
give this message to any mounted
officer you meet dont let your cattle
stray and take you away from the road
the rustic put the paper in his hat and
promised to deliver it at the first oppor-
tunity the soldiers were split into two
bands one for each side of the road and
ordered to search the countryside closely
and to a considerable distance the officer
going with the detachment assigned to the
east side of the road during this business
the maid had trembled until i feared she
would betray us i scarcely dared to
breathe until the last red coat had quit
the road and the officer was hurrying to
take the eastern end of his line

  the cowherd lost all ambition for haste
and seated himself in the shade and at-
tempted to read the message the scrap
of paper became of vast importance to me
i saw in it a passport a safe-conduct and
being directly over the fellow i dropped
down upon him flattening him to the
ground the girl gave a little cry and
i called for her to be calm i remained
where i had landed-on top of the cowherd
-until satisfied my mishap had not been
observed from the fields then i got hold
of the fellows throat and drew him to one
side there was no necessity for choking
him as he was unconscious

       i called to the girl to come down
and bring the cloak and belt with
strips torn from the cloak i secured
the fellows hands and feet and with a stick
and more of the cloak improvised a gag
by the time he opened his eyes he was
snugly tucked from view behind a small
clump of bushes some distance from the
road

  did you kill him asked the girl as
i returned to the tree

  i	quieted her fears and recovered the
note from the dust and opened it it read

to any of his majestys mounted officers

  lieutenant hopgood st infantry reports the
murder of colonel wentsel heavy dragoons by
escaped spy lieutenant hopgood has men on
each side of the kings road working north and
raking the fields and farms signed hopgood

  cutting her a stick i picked up the cow-
herds staff and the two of us soon had the
drove moving up the road at a far better
pace than my victim had ever achieved
the white dawn



the exhilaration of being afoot of being
free to move gave me high spirits mistress
osmonds small face took on a new expres-
sion with a sidelong glance she said-
you are quite resourceful for a ser-
geant

  you are very brave for a ladys maid
i rejoined if we meet any soldiers chase
after a cow keep in motion dont let your
hat fall off and youd better rub some
dirt on that pretty face of yours

  she did so and also rubbed dirt on the
backs of her small hands and on her wrists
but she refused to soil her slim throat which
showed soft and white above the coarse

shirt in such punctilios will the feminine
mind indulge to remedy the incongruous
effect i had her tie her handkerchief snugly
about her neck albeit the day was over
warm for half a mile the cattle moved
smartly and then slowed up to a graze
a strong breeze came from the north but
lessened the heat none it brought black
clouds and the rumble of thunder the
maid walked close bv my side and said-
it will be a thunderstorm

  the best thing we could ask for better
than night i rejoiced

  i dont like the lightning she confessed
a quaint contradiction she dared every-
thing in running the british lines trusted
to her nimble heels to escape from old
mother baffs band and was afraid of
a thunderstorm

  im sorry i tried to shoot you at the

betworth house she suddenly said i
was not myself i am very sorry

  please dont remember it you did
perfectly right

  a blinding flash and a terrific explosion
sent the cattle to crowding against each
other the maid pressed against my side
and faltered-

  that struck near here

  the rain began falling as if the bottom
had been torn from some celestial lake
puffs of dust rose under the bombardment
for a bit then the road became a lagoon
the fields steamed and objects were blurred
at a short distance i passed my arm
around the maid to support her we bowed
against the cloudburst and almost before
we knew it mounted men were splashing
out of the leaden wall ahead an officer
almost rode us down and bellowed-

  keep your cattle out of the way

  i produced the message and handed it
up to him he had his cloak over his head
just as my oneida friend the tree-breaker
wears his blanket when the weather is
rough and i glimpsed a hawklike face and
gray mustaches as he bent over the writing
to the muffled figures back of him he
roared

  -s mercy colonel wentsel has been
murdered by that cursed spy hopgood
of the light infantry writes this he has
men out on each side of the road hunting
for the blood-thirsty devil good thing
too soft to take our horses into the fields
forward

  his stirrup hit me in the chest and sent
me to one side as a courteous reminder to
clear the way they splashed by at a trot
each muffled pyramid of a man blind to
their great chance we drove our cattle
through the little village during the down-
pour and saw no one abroad by the time
the storm cleared we had driven our cattle
over the kings bridge less than a year
before i had passed that way and had wit-
nessed the destruction of the small wooden
structure by the retreating american army
leaving the maid to herd the cows i went
to the spacious two-story tavern near the
old wading place kept by john cock and
at the kitchen door bought some bread
and cheese and a jug of fresh-drawn beer

  we were off the island and within seven-
teen miles of white plains and about the
same distance from tarrytown the road
through wepperham was the most direct


adventure

allowing us to keep close to the river and
cross at dobbs ferry if fortune favored us
or at tarrytown above betsy was fair
delighted and i had to caution her or she
would have burst into singing

  the storm was rushing out to sea and the
islandwas drawing away from us and her
heart was high in knowing so much of
danger had been avoided or overcome

  its you i have to thank she earnestly
said and to think how i talked to you at
the farmhouse and how you refused the
journey-cake through pride i was glad-
the other man came back and took it

  that would be bucks i murmured

  so still driving our weary cattle we
fard north while across the river general
washingtons army waited at ramapo to
see which way howes army would jump
and we had the news which would set our
army in motion

chapter vii

the army falls back

we reached ramapo without seri-
ous difficulties and the maid vanished
to find her mistress and procure suitable at-
tire i presented myself at headquarters
only to learn that bucks already had ar-
rived with the news of howes sailing and
that it was not necessary for general wash-
ington to question me in person i handed
over poor bowens papers to an aide from
conversation with this officer i learned that
anxiety over howes plans had lost some of
its edge being dulled by worry over bur-
goynes advance upon ticonderoga with
a magnificently equipped and superbly offi-
cered army

  burgoyne had won renown in portugal
and all his staff and regimental officers were
distinguished by their professional attain-
ments even st luc de la corne in com-
mand of the indian host was the best of his
kind and had no superior in audacity and
ferocity in truth i heard more about this
inhuman character than i did of the experi-
enced riedesel the knightly fraser bold
lord balcarras the distinguished phillips
or any of the other eminent officers with
burgoyne nor is this strange for men
talk of that which they hold in detestation
or fear burgoynes officers were uniformly
most courteous gentlemen the partisan in-
dian leader was close kin to the devil

  it was early morning when we arrived at

ramapo and my business at headquarters
was soon done i wandered about the camp
and the village and found soldiers and civ-
ilians gabbing wild stories some of them to
the effect that stout ticonderoga had fallen
there was nothing to warrant these rumors
and i would have dismissed them as camp
gossip if not for my friend the aide hunting
me up shortly after the noon hour with or-
ders for me to travel at post speed to fort
edward general schuylers headquarters
to learn the truth about conditions in the
north

  i was to select a man to act as my mes-
senger the aide intimated that our com-
mander was much disgruntled over the lack
of definite information about the invading
armys progress at once i set about hunt-
ing for bucks and instead encountered
miss audrey betworth on the outskirts of
the village she was walking with her maid
if possible she was more beautiful than ever
had parthenope possessed such charms no
ulysses could have passed her by

  i came to a halt and bared my head and
stood like a yokel hoping to hear her voice
she looked at me as though i were some
strange kind of a bug her gaze taking me in
in passing i hurried on down the rough
road to be alone until i could recover my
self-respect

  i can not follow you any farther mr
sergeant a despairing voice called behind
me

  it was betsy osmond dressed and be-
frilled and as dainty as any flower by
some miracle she had lost all traces of
fatigue and her face dimpled mischievously
as she read my sullen countenance

  one may look at a queen but queens see
nothing close to the ground she bantered

  what do i care naturally she hates
me

  oh no that would be dignifying you
she would not more than dislike you if you
were a colonel i scarcely doubt if she has
ever met any man of high enough station to
merit her hate and youre only an un-
known sergeant

  how happens she walks with you
when will you tell her what youve done

  she loves me ive told her all was
the simple reply

  the thought of being loved by audrey
betworth it humanized her and made her
even more wonderful to be encompassed
by mistress audreys love was equivalent to
the white dawn



being glorified i gaped in awe at the little
maid who seemed to accept the miracle so
coolly

  we dont think alike she went on
we make sacrifices for opposing forces
but she knows she can do nothing to stop
me from loving her and i have done noth-
ing yet to kill her love she is as good as
she is beautiful

  a bit of doubt persisted in my mind as i
recalled all the maid had done in new york
i intimated as much

  oh i told her all she quietly said
we had a good cry together madame
betworth was severe with me but after she
has thought things over she is a very just
woman she said it was very friendly in
me not to betray her kinsman while he was
posing as captain sant mistress audrey
wept when i told her about my escape and
the dangers she petted me much ive
obtained permission for them to go to al-
bany ive told such horrible stories about
the plague that madame would not return
to the city even if she could

  what will she say when she knows you
followed me

  she knows it now i couldnt let you go
without saying good-by without thanking
you without saying again it was terrible
of me to try to shoot you

  betsy osmond youre a marvelous little
woman youve dared more- in one day
than your icicle of a mistress would dare for
george the third in a lifetime

  she dropped me a courtesy and primly
said-

  nevertheless youre in love with the
icicle

  what foolishness child

  i wouldnt be very marvelous if i
couldnt see that much she spoke of you
when i said i must speak with you

  she did she said what

  that some day you would be hung

  my dismay must have appealed to her
sense of humor for she laughed then sud-
denly becoming very grave she extended her
hand and said

  we had a queer experience together
you proved yourself a good companion
my mistress sees things from a different
angle but it doesnt follow we must stop
loving her

  ive said nothing about love ive seen
her only twice

  one need see her only once to love her

she sighed it might be well if men could
control their love for she will love but once
she loves now

  i dont know

  and its not for a sergeant in the ameri-
can army to ask betsy osmond i am
glad you followed me it was kind of you
now its good-by and although i too go
north we may not meet again but re-
member that i always think of you as the
marvelous little woman

  we may meet in albany

  i travel farther than albany and i
start as soon as i find the man called
bucks

  with a nod of her pretty head she turned
and hurried up the road there was an
oddness in her leave-taking which puzzled
me however there were many things to
think about besides betsy osmond for
within an hour i found bucks thirty
minutes thereafter we were mounted on ex-
cellent animals armed with deckhard rifles
and riding north

  as we rode through the war-weary coun-
trysides bucks told me his adventures in
short he had managed to reach kings
bridge ahead of the alarm and had had no
trouble in crossing the river and making
ramapo but it was not until we had
reached albany that we had talked our-
selves out for he needs must hear my story

  we began observing conditions and the
mood of the people tryon county that
vast region containing all the settlements
west and southwest of schenectady was
boiling with terror we did not need to as-
cend the mohawk to learn that much men
and women pouring into albany supplied
the information from their testimony it
was plain that the settlers along the mo-
hawk were eager for the strongest alliance
be it american or british this because of
their outlying position and their exposure to
indian raids

  even the friendly oneidas now camped
close to schenectady were uneasy for they
knew the mohawks keepers of the eastern
door were coming under joseph brant
along with barry st legers army and that
there would be a bloody reckoning from
oriskany german flats palatine and
schoharie the committees of safety were
sending frantic messages to general schuy-
ler all bespeaking pessimism

  the spirit of the people was pusillani-
mous charged one report persons of


adventure

influence were betraying america accused an-
other both regulars and militia in the val-
ley seemed to be almost paralyzed with
fear or at least they were not displaying the
qualities expected from soldiers and citizens
these conditions were the more disturbing
because they had not been expected for
tryon county early in the war had taken
the lead in emphasizing loyalty to the new
republic

  bucks viewed all this as being more seri-
ous in the telling than in the fact stripped
of his idioms he believed that just before the
arrival of any test of strength there are cer-
tain phases of nervousness to be gone
through with he confidently held that the
average man steadies down to his work and
does it well once he finds the crisis upon him

  after theyve been well blooded theyll
do fine he insisted

  i soon discovered another trend of
thought which disturbed me keenly and
which could not be explained away or miti-
gated by the riflemans philosophy this
was a growing hostility toward general
schuyler the command of the northern
department had from the beginning been a
political prize with congress stupidly shift-
ing generals as fast as an aspirant could de-
velop more political strength than was pos-
sessed by the incumbent

  in schuylers case i traced his ill fortune
to new englands prejudice against new
york and the cause could be sought far
back in colonial days being expecially no-
ticeable during the french war

  i drew up my impressions in the form of
a letter and went to the flats above the town
to find a soldier to be detailed as my mes-
senger the intelligence was not of suffi-
cient importance to be despatched by
bucks nor did the rifleman have any in-
clination to ride south while we were jog-
ging through the outskirts of the town we
were compelled to slow down by a group of
excited citizens blocking the road as we
were skirting these a man wildly yelled

  good- theyve took ticonderoga

i reached down and caught the
fellow by the scruff of the neck and
shook him soundly and warned

  no more of that or well give you a taste
of the lash st clair holds ticonderoga
the strongest fort in america he can hold
it against all the red backs england can
send to say otherwise is treason

  the man wrenched himself free and
rubbed his neck and sullenly replied

  go shake him who brought the word
mister soldier theres no talk about it
bding took by assault mebbe they shot sil-
ver bullets agin the walls and sinclair
picked em up

  you low scum roared bucks and he
would have ridden him down had i not
seized his bridle

  the offender drew back into the crowd

  a woman shrilly cried

  you aint our bosses if the fort aint
took whyd they send a injun runner down
here to skeer folks for

  wheres the runner i demanded anx-
ious to prevent the silly tale from causing a
panic

  under the trees in my orchard gitting
his wind back spoke up a citizen hes
run from stillwater with nary a stop i
guess

  i tossed my reins to bucks and dis-
mounted and followed the direction the citi-
zen pointed out the little mob tagged
after me but i soon discouraged this atten-
dance i soon came to the indiana powerful-
ly built chap lying face down his shoulders
rising and falling as he charged his lungs
with air he was naked except for his
breech-clout and paint bag

  my brother has run far i said in the
oneida tongue

  running did not tire him it was the
heavy burden he carried my brother the
white one he replied without lifting his
head

  i knew him then to be the tree breaker
my old friend i sat beside him and lighted
my pipe and placed it in his outstretched
hancl slowly his fingers closed on the
stem and rolling on his side he puffed to the
sky and earth the figure of a bear sitting
on its haunches the paws resting on a tree
trunk was freshly painted on the bronzed
chest i reached out my hand and he
pressed it warmly and passed the pipe to me
and i smoked to his wind gods and the sun
and the earth

  many sleeps from now after the tree
breaker has run his last race his grave shall
be surrounded with red and white and black
sticks with a big opening at the foot as be-
comes a great chief of the oneidas i said
his white brothers heart is glad to see him
his brother is ready to take the heavy bur-
den from his shoulders
the white dawn



  he slowly rose to a sitting posture and i
shouted to bucks to bring my blanket for
it is not seemly that a man mighty among
his ovn people should be gaped at like a
bear at a baiting bucks could not leave
the horses and sent the blanket by the owner
of the orchard i dismissed the man and
carefully draped it about my friend never
in all my life had i realized the precious
value of minutes as i did while waiting to
take the burden from his shoulders no not
even when my life hung in the balance on
the island of manhattan yet i could not
request him to tell his news and when he did
speak it would be much in figures

  a half a minute passed then he said

  my brother shall help carry the burden
ticonderoga is too heavy for one to carry
it falls to the ground it is in the dirt
dust rises and hides the stars

  there must have been enough blood to
stop the dust

  he stared blankly at the circle of citizens
for another thirty seconds then said-
there was no blood

  it was horrible it was incredible ti-
conderoga the impregnable gate against in-
vasion captured without a struggle

  some evil bird told foolish stories to my
brother of the bear clan

  apparently he did not hear me i waited
knowing i would receive my answer at
last he said

  the oneida saw the red stars fall from
the mountain he saw the long house of
the white chiefs burn like dry grass the
americans crossed the lake in the middle of
the night that is all

  why did you bring your burden here
i could not lay it down at fort edward
general schuyler was not there

  i must send the talking paper to the
great white chief how many sleeps ago
did my brother see this

  he held up two fingers which would place
the undreamed-of catastrophe on july fifth

  wait for me here i ride north and
want a chief at my side i have a brave
soldier waiting for me i will send him
south with the paper if i can not have a
chief i must go into the woods alone

  his chest expanded the blanket fell
around his loins and as his head went back
his mouth opened to sound the terrific war-
cry of the oneidas the elder brothers
and i knew i would fare well for a traveling
companion my next task was very dis-

agreeable for i must sadly disappoint a very
brave man i returned to my horse and
procured paper from the saddle-flap and
hastily wrote my second message telling the
evil tidings the oneida had brought and
vouching for hishonesty and his devotion to
the american cause addressing this to
general washington i handed it to bucks
and simply said

  i have found my messenger go
sarge sarge you dont mean it you
couldnt do it he pleaded

  ticonderoga has fallen without making
any resistance i will trust no man in the
north to ride with that news but you

  oh - and we thought the critters

was talking foolishness old ti took no
fighting then by the eternal british
gold did what british lead couldnt ever do
and the brave fellow began to blubber like a
heart-broken child

  will bucks will bucks i grieved
you will unnerve me get this to general
washington as soon as possible god help
us else this will end the war

  -help any one that tries to hinder me

going south for if i must go ill streak it
and im coming back a-hooting

  with that he wheeled his horse and dashed
away on his hundred-mile ride

  i hastened back to the oneida he had
withdrawn deeper into the orchard and
something in his bearing had discouraged the
curious from following him when i came
upon him he was seated before a small trade-
mirror painting his face he did not take
any notice of me and i knew i was not
wanted while he oiled and painted for war

  i went back to my horse and during the
period of waiting found time to analyze my
feelings the more fully to comprehend the ex-
tent of the disaster it was useless to ask
the oneida for details in his own time and
with much figurative embellishment he
would reveal the truth more fully evi-
dently the fort had been fired upon from
some height but ticonderoga was sup-
posed to be impregnable if so why were
not all the surrounding heights fortified

  i was to learn later that the supposedly
storm-proof works were poorly manned
that instead of a garrison of five thousand
there was but half that number of conti-
nental troops including nine hundred raw
militia many of the latter were scarcely
more than boys none of them was ade-
quately armed one third of the garrison


adventure

was unfit for duty it would later come out
that in attempting to strengthen the de-
fenses st clair recently appointed as fort
commandant had over-extended the works
and had left sugar loaf hill mt defiance
and mount hope unoccupied it was from
these two positions and especially from
sugar loaf that the british had raked the
fort

  gates was originally appointed to com-
mand at ticonderoga but his jealousy of
schuyler caused him to refuse thus delaying
jlhe work of putting the fort in a proper state
of defense but all this was for me to learn
on some tomorrow i knew the news was
true and i leaned against my horse my
heart and head both low as i traced the ad-
vance of the evil tidings up the hill and
through the town god knows we had
feared the worst when we learned of the
three-fold movementof burgoyne st leger
and howe even with howe out of the
campaign there was but one chance of pre-
venting burgoyne from reaching albany
and that was to cut his line of supplies before
he reached the hill town and could levy
upon the new hampshire grams and the
mohawk valley

  my brother makes a new war medi-
cine courteously asked the tree breaker

  i jerked up my head and endeavored to
smile ashamed to show emotion before one
who was bound to construe it as an unmanly
weakness

  my medicine is strong it shows very
red inside jjiy eyes we shall find much
fighting in the woods i hear there are
some western indians with the english

  he had painted the upper half of his face
white and the lower half red from the
roots of his scalp-lock to his chin he had
drawn long marks to represent scratches left
by a bears claw and had cunningly colored
the marks red on the white background and
black against the red there were no wo-
men nor children to be seen after the oneida
emerged from the orchard with much con-
tempt he said

  there are some cowardly dogs of sioux
sacs foxes menominees chippewas win-
nebagoes ottawas mohawks and abnaki

  then more thoughtfully he added

  the mohawks will make a good fight
the ottawas are very big men but there is
much water in their blood they do not
like to fight as well as they like to drink rum
and burn prisoners because i am from the

bear people i will crush one dead with my
arms

  your orenda is mighty-st luc de la
corne leads those indians

  a black snake leads them he may be
called as my brother says there is an old
frenchman with them who is a big warrior
he led the fight against braddock he led
the miami and western indians when they
killed the soldiers in fort william henry
he must be a very cunning old man his
head would be better than many scalps
this would be charles de langlade in
the french and indian war he had counted
some mighty coups but st luc was the
leader he became a british subject after
france lost canada he offered to sell
himself and his savage following to mont-
gomery when the expedition of seventy-
six promised to result in victory he was
distrusted by both sir guy carleton and
montgomery and when our general cap-
tured montreal he refused to include the
perfidious wretch in the capitulation

  such a treacherous man would quit the
british the moment he believed they were
making a losing fight alas there was
small likelihood of his seeking other employ-
ment now that ticonderoga had fallen it
was enough to make heathen gods laugh to
behold this cruel turn-coat serving the brit-
ish on the very ground he had reddened with
the blood of hundreds of british soldiers in
the old war he would need to take many
american scalps before he could equal his
string of british hair yet he was an edu-
cated man a courtier by instinct artful and
ambitious

  i told the oneida i would get him a horse
and he replied-

  the bear who breaks down trees has a
horse

i swung into the saddle and took
the road for fort edward fifty
miles way tree breaker trotted
at my stirrup apparently none the worse
for his recent exertions the news of ti-
conderogas fall had been spread by couriers
or fugitives by this time and the road to the
mohawk crossing was dotted with men and
women and children riding south in carts
on horseback or plodding along afoot as
though the red terror would pounce upon
them at any moment many of these
hurled questions at us although we were
making for and not from the zone of
the white dawn



danger others urged us to turn back and
there were others who said nothing but hur-
ried on their gaze never quitting the open
road their every thought and energy bent
on reaching albany town

  birds might sing and the july sun distil
sweet odors from the grass fields but for
these fugitives there was nothing in the
world except stark horror and the implacable
axes of st luc de la cornes painted men

i endeavored to learn fresher news from
some of these fleeing settlers i was told
that ticonderoga had been burned and the
entire army massacred that skenesborough
was in ashes as well as the settlements in the
new hampshire grants and that even ben-
nington had been sacked and fearful toll of
blood and prisoners taken that fort ann
and fort edward had fallen without strik-
ing a blow in defense was also wofully pro-
claimed

  schuylers gone over to the red coats
he sold hisself cried a woman in a cart

  shut up if he has it shows his sense
growled her hulking mate were all for
the king up here anyway we aint noth-
ing to be afeared off from gineral bur-
goynes indians as he spoke he cast a
frightened glance over his shoulder ten
miles beyond the mouth of the mohawk the
oneida left me for a short time and when he
returned he was mounted and leading a sec-
ond horse for me to ride i shifted my sad-
dle to this fresh mount and turned my weary
nag into the fields to graze

  the roads are filled with little devil-birds
that make mens hearts turn white by sing-
ing about bloody axes ho the tree
breaker and the white one are keepers of
the road they will make the western in-
dians run back to canada he chanted

  i did not deny the heroic role he imputed
to me to have informed him i was bent
solely on learning the truth about our
armys defeat would have been interpreted
by him as a reflection on his veracity and i
would have seen my old friend no more
we were on the outskirts of stillwater when
the oneida went for his horse and now we
encountered the first fugitives from the east
side of the river a bateau filled with wo-
men and children and handled by two men

  why do you come over here i asked
one of the men he did not answer both
seemed to have lost their wits one of the
women replied

  the injuns are burnin an sculpin on

the hoosic we got away just in the nick o
time

  that cant be i told her no in-
dians are as far south as this there has
been a fight at ticonderoga the american
army is between you and the savages

  the american army ha ha hys-
terically yelled another woman who was
carrying a baby at her breast theyre
burnin every farm on the hoosic before
sunup this mornin we could hear em
screechin like panthers the american
army is all dead or hidin in the grants

  this was arrant nonsense of course i
translated it to the tree breaker who un-
derstood english fairly well only when it was
slowly spoken

  they saw the red paint of the sun they
heard wolves howling they are very fool-
ish he observed disdaining to glance at
the little group again

  we left them to take up their flight south
after my suggestion that they stick to their
boat and float down the river had been re-
jected they were out of their reason with
fear and instinct drove them to keep near
cover

  beyond stillwater we halted and the
oneida disappeared and was gone long
enough to requisition a quarter of fresh beef
and a kettle he had found the kettle in a
deserted house and had butchered a steer
close to the road we camped long enough
to boil some of the beef which was tough
and unsavory for the lack of salt tree
breaker did not care for salt and ate heart-
ily while we were eating there was a rush-
ing of feet through the bushes and the two
horses which i had hobbled made much
noise we ran to investigate and found
three militiamen striving to remove the
hobbles

  i covered them with my deckhard and or-
dered them to leave the animals alone the
oneida poised his ax

  they belong to us we ride north to
join the army i said

  army - there aint no army

bawled the leader of the trio guess well
have to take these critters in the name of the
republic

  the oneida brandished his ax and
sounded his war-cry as one the three
turned and dived into the bushes in their
flight south they had even thrown away
their fire-locks

  no - good spat out the tree


adventure

breaker speaking in english it is needless
to say

  when we resumed our journey we
glimpsed small bodies of men skulking
through the bush and fields on either side of
the road these were more of the militia in
a panic and it was a curious fact that
whenever we succeeded in questioning any
of these fugitives we were none the better off
as for news they were filled with frenzied
words and drew the most absurd pictures of
the calamity we were so impressed with
the utter uselessness of seeking the truth
before reaching fort edward that we de-
sisted from further efforts

  late that evening we came to saratoga
general schuylers country house on the
right where the road crosses fishkill creek
was dark but a light burned in a church
on the left i left the oneida with the
horses before this building while i advanced
to investigate although the night was
warm the door of the church was closed
i threw it open and beheld a dozen men and
women an elderly man was addressing
them he ceased speaking when the door
opened i was amazed at the expression of
horror on each face as there was nothing
alarming in my appearance

  the indians are here shrieked a wo-
man in the shaft of light shot through the
open door they had seen the oneida an
equestrian figure in bronze

  we are messengers from general wash-
ington i loudly proclaimed we seek
general schuyler can you give us any in-
formation as to where we might find him

  god be with him but we fear he has
been killed with all the others said the
elderly man he was to marcfi with rein-
forcements to ticonderoga thats the last
word we received please take your indian
away he frightens the women folks
and in all truth he might have added the
men folks

  we crossed the fishkill and forced our
tired mounts for another two miles or until
we came to the ford of the hudson and went
into camp for the night on the fort edward
road the tree breaker had fetched the
kettle and meat along and we made a meal
after a fashion

  we finished the fifty-mile ride by noon
the next day and found general schuyler
just returned from a futile attempt to lead a
slender force to aid st clair hold the north-
ern gate but an army of five thousand

could not have held the place once the
enemy had hauled their guns up the steep
slopes of sugar loaf hill learning from
his aide that i was from general washing-
tons headquarters general schuyler had me
before him and immediately i experienced
the charm of his most gracious personality

  he was strong without being autocratic
america always came first with him and
position and power could pass him by with-
out lessening by a tittle his zeal for the re-
public i explained my errand was to ob-
serve conditions and remit reports to wash-
ington he sorrowfully said

  it will be sad news for general washing-
ton i did what i could to put the fort and
works in condition and general st clair did
all he could to strengthen the place but
we lacked supplies and we needed twice as
many men as we had i am starting a mes-
senger south at once giving the facts of the
affair ticonderoga was shelled from an un-
occupied height the army retreated across
a floating bridge at midnight the women
the sick and the wounded were taken to
skenesborough on two hundred bateaux es-
corted by six hundred men in five galleys
commanded by colonel long we lost our
heavy artillery and supplies

  once the garrison troops crossed the lake
they were joined by the troops from fort in-
dependence general fraser pursued these
on the sixth followed by riedesel and
his german grenadiers burgoyne and
phillips followed colonel long and his flo-
tilla overtaking them on the seventh at the
wharves of skenesborough two galleys
surrendered

  the crews destroyed the others as well as
burning the mills the stockade and the ba-
teaux colonel long then fell back to fort
anne eleven miles below yesterday morn-
ing he would have whipped colonel hill the
foremost of his pursuers if not for the in-
dians under st luc de la corne sent for-
ward by burgoyne from skenesborough
burning fort anne colonel long fell back
to this fort arriving this morning

  where is general st clair general

  god knows he retreated into the new
hampshire grants if you wish to do a
service sergeant scout to the east and find
him and urge him to bring his force here at
once i thank god that burgoyne is march-
ing his army from skenesborough he will
find much trouble in getting through had
he gone back to ticonderoga and come
the white dawn



down lake george he would have had an
open road to albany he could have been
here to reduce this fort by the thirteenth
at least we have that to be thankful for

  general i shall be pleased to make the
scout now there is no need for me to dupli-
cate your message to general washington
i will take with me an oneida the tree
breaker an old friend it will save me
some explanations later if you will add to
your report that you are using me for
special work and that i have nothing to add
to what you have so kindly told me

  ill fix that sergeant morgan how
congress will howl and want to dance my
scalp well well theyve danced better
ones

  i deny that general i warmly de-
clared

  he smiled benevolently and patted my
shoulder and walked to the door with me

  beware of the savages after you have
met and passed through my line of axmen
he cautioned they swarm the woods
scalping the dead and dying and as the
rum is in and the ax is out theyre scalping
the british and hessian wounded and dead
too the tories of argyle are frantically
flocking to burgoyne and begging him to
protect them from his red pets burgoyne
will have his unquiet moments in doing
that very thing ottawa help is a blade
that cuts with two edges good luck lad

  the marvel of the man to me was his ca-
pacity for being gracious even solicitous for
my welfare when he knew the storm was
rolling up which would sweep him from his
command and deliver the department to the
less worthy gates

rejoining the oneida i found
him surrounded by a circle of sol-
diers- who were inclined to resent
his presence being suspicious of his ameri-
canism he did not seem to know they
were there and-his haughtiness held them
back from any demonstration beyond mut-
tered threats and epithets he was relieved
by my appearance however and was eager
to be off we struck into the old military
road used by abercrombie and amherst in
the french war and followed it for a few
miles

  this was the road open to burgoyne had
he had the wit to use it instead of attempt-
ing to bring his army through a virgin wil-
derness where natures obstacles were aug-

mented by the american backwoodsmen
he was to use up twenty-four precious days
in covering twenty-six miles and each day
of grace was worth a regiment to schuyler
and his weakened army

  we met several scores of soldiers strag-
gling into the road from the bush these
although having been in contact with the
enemy were not suffering from panic they
did seem to be disprited possibly a ma-
jority of them should have been in the hos-
pital three wagon drivers were emptying
the brine from their casks of pork to lessen
the load thus spoiling the pork this was
due to ignorance rather than fear for other-
wise they would have cut loose the horses
and fled

  two men-nay mere boys-attracted
my attention by their extreme youth and
their emaciation they barely managed to
walk and clung to each other for mutual
support horses were useless where i pro-
posed going and i signaled the oneida to
dismount the two invalids halted in
alarm and one of them drew a knife the
only weapon they seemed to possess they
imagined the indian and i intended to take
their scalps

  get up on the horses tell them at
fort edward that sergeant morgan and
the tree breaker will call for them later i
said leading the animals forward

  even then they feared some trickery i
motioned the oneida to retire a few rods and
i laid my deckhard on the ground to aid
them in mounting they did not attempt
to thank me with words but their lips
trembled and big tears rolled down their
poor cheeks they rode away to safety
i briefly explained to my companion the
things told me by general schuyler and his
eyes flamed as he heard the name of st
luc

  his warriors will be very thick in the
woods he hissed it is good the
western indians shall show the elder broth-
ers how to fight it is said the oneidas are
quick to learn

  we had covered about three out of the
sixteen miles between fort edward and
fort anne and now it was time to leave
the road and strike through the timber due
east so as to pass some ten miles below
fort anne this course i hoped would
bring me in contact with general st clairs
army for the first few miles we took
advantage of the game trails and covered

 the ground quickly until night came we
 made no efforts to conceal our advance
 the oneida bagged several grouse and as
 i had procured a small supply of salt while
 at edward i fared well before sunrise we
 were racing toward the east after two
 hours of fast work the oneida in the lead
 threw out his hand as a signal for me to
 halt i heard it a heavy crashing sound
 far ahead

   the axmen i murmured

   we soon came up to them sullen deter-
 mined fellows who knew they risked their
 lives each moment they paused to impede
 the advance of burgoynes army for
 every two choppers there was a man on
 guard with a flintlock first would come
 the cloud of indians and last the veteran
 of portugal and his regulars could i have
 known that those continental honors were
 i to receive no luster from our northern
 woods i would not have felt so downhearted
 as i watched the backwoodsmen bring down
 tree after tree the men scowled fiercely
 at the oneida who stared straight ahead
 leaving it for me to obtain free passage for
 him and i doubt if he could have trav-
 ersed the barricaded area alive if my ex-
 planation had not served as road-belt

   the axmen gave back doggedly and only
 when they had left a chevaux-de-frise behind
 them now began our difficulties huge
 trees had carried down those of lesser
 growth and the long winrows presented
 a rare jumble of splintered branches and
 upright boughs so thorough was the work
 in spots that it did not seem as if a weasel
 could get through but the tree breaker
 with the cunning of his clan tutelary the
 bear glided around and climbed over and
 dived under our route often being circuit-
 ous yet always swinging back to the east
 the indian always kept ahead his painted
 head and oiled body shining like a snake
 here in the woods his facial decorations were
 most ghastly

   he dropped on his knees and wriggled
 under a huge bole i followed at his heels
 but instead of rising he remained flat on
 his stomach i drew myself beside him
 and he whispered

  an ottawa a very big man he
 should be very brave wait for me be-
 fore i could remonstrate or ask a question
 he glided like a snake into the debris and
 was gone some ants from a rotten log
 began to explore me much to my incon-

 venience in the north i heard the howling
 of wolves the dead in the forest tempting
 them to the hunting before it was dark
 then came a subdued scuffling sound near-
 by but cut off from my line of vision by the
 thick growth i located it as being just
 beyond a prostrate pine the branches of
 which formed a green wall

  as i stared at this two brown hands
appeared clutching the boughs and a moc-
casined foot was thrust through and rested
on the trunk i raised my rifle then lowered
it as through the screen stepped the tree
breaker he held something above his
head and howled his scalp-cry then with
grotesque steps striking his feet smartly
into the forest mold he danced to my
hiding place while he was thus indulging
his vanity another hand appeared through
the green tangle and another indian stood
on the tree trunk and fitted an arrow to his
bow i knocked him backward killing
him instantly his bare legs remaining in
sight

  the oneida wheeled and leaped to my
victim and was soon repeating his scalp-
cry and was dancing back with two instead
of one gory trophies from the song he
improvised i learned that both indians
were ottawas big as forest trees but
quickly broken down by the mighty tree
breaker of the bear clan of the oneida
people not a word as to my part in the
tragedy i finally managed to secure his
attention and upbraided him for risking
our lives by calling the dead warriors com-
panions down upon us

  ho white one who shoots before a tree-
cat can snarl there were but two i found
their trail before i killed one my white
brother did well but to seize a man with
the bare hands to bend him and break him
as a bear pulls down and breaks a young
tree to get at the ripe fruit is the coup the
oneidas make into songs

  there will be others following these
two

  the tree breaker has a long voice he
will make new medicine if his scalp-cry does
not bring more game to his trap

  i am scouting for general schuyler not
to kill indians if you wish to stay here
and kill mangy ottawas i will go on alone
but until i find st clair there must be
no killing for the killings sake i have
spoken

  there is a cloud over the sun he said
the white dawn



after a brief silence its shade is over the
white ones heart or it may be wild
pigeons passing or thick tree tops shutting
out the light if the cloud goes away the
tree breaker will follow his white brother
and let his hands and knife sleep

  this was handsomely said especially for
an indian i replied

  the sun drinks up the cloud it burns
the tree tops away and lets in the light
the pigeons have passed over to the hat-
irontaks the white one sees the path
clearly come

  this time i took the lead as he had sug-
gested

  it was very warm and the black flies tor-
mented us but of savage life there was no
evidence yet we knew the scalp-yells had
been heard and that as we pressed east
a horde of the enemys red allies were has-
tening west to learn who had fallen and to
avenge his death it was impossible to
read beneath the hideous mask of paint on
tree breakers face but he could not sup-
press the excitement shining in his eyes
he was keyed up to great adventures and
his hand was ever on the handle of his toma-
hawk his quick gaze sweeping half circles
as he sought enemies in ambush

  our progress was interrupted by a call for
help instead of by a war-cry expecting
only the latter i was rendered stupid for
a moment the faint voice mouthing the
one word help died down into a groan
the oneidas nostrils pinched in and his
savage little eyes became dancing dots as
he sought to locate the sufferer

  water water for the love of god-
water

  a wounded man i whispered

  let the tree breaker go and bring him
here he said but this i feared to do for
if the sufferer should be an english soldief
the oneida would-quickly spoil his throat
i shook off tree breakers hand and crawled
forward now the voice was faintly moan-
ing i parted some dead branches and
beheld a man with both arms over his head
he had heard me or sensed my presence for
he began gasping-

     w ater-water-water  

  i am a friend i said bending over
him

  instantly two sinewy arms were around
my neck and his long legs were twisted
about mine holding me helpless and his
voice in my ear as he shouted in an indian

dialect i did not understand deafened me
i struck blindly but could do him no
mischief guns began to bang and the
shrieking cry of defiance of the oneida came
from a distance then strong hands were
seizing me and trussing me up with lengths
of rawhide i was stood on my feet and
the make-believe sick man also stood up
and brushed the twigs and dirt from his
forest clothes and bowed prettily sweeping
his hat to the ground

ah msieu of the soft heart
i salute you you are most polite
he mocked and he made another
elaborate bow there was no guessing his
age as his long beard was coppery brown
and his hair showed no gray completely
surrounding us was a circle of savages
naked except for loin cloths or a shirt
these were tall brawny fellows fantastically
painted

  from their stature i took them to be
ottawas they eyed me hungrily the
frenchman for he was that although he
spoke english without any accent that
i could catch continued

  msieu is like an angel from heaven he
hears the voice of suffering his heart
melts what does msieu think should be
his reward for such gentle kindness

  he was playing with me and vastly amus-
ing his red followers i said nothing and
turned my back he whirled me about and
struck me in the face and with a voice of
velvet begged

  please please msieu give me your
attention for a little what shall msieu
have for pitying the voice of the distressed
this time i was careful not to take my
eyes from his gaze with more mincing
steps which seemed to amuse his red
friends much he answered his own query
by saying-

  msieu shall have the honor of being the
next to fit into an ottawa kettle

  he waited to see how this announcement
affected me i was too benumbed by the
shock of my capture to display any emotion
with a shrill screech he grabbejl my hair
with both hands and shook my head vio-
lently and yelled

  into the pot with you this night you
shot the turtle your red companion
killed my best trailer you shall die two
deaths in one

  i gathered my wits and asked-
io

adventure

  who are you that have to play such
sorry tricks to get your man

  he struck his chest lightly and threw
back his headland in a shrill voice proclaimed
i am st luc de la corne veteran of
pontiacs war the french war and of this
little war you have killed two of my best
warriors it will be hard to cover their
bones with one body but we will do the
best we can

  far off rose the triumphant cry of the
oneida st luc glared wolfishly at me
and demanded-

  that means what

  the oneida has made another kill hell
get all your trailers if you do not call them
back

  his rage seemed to have left him with
no show of resentment he gave an order
and two of his ottawas took hold of my
elbows and helped me over the encumbered
ground making toward the north once
when i pitched forward and the savages
were roughly dragging me to my feet the
strange creature spoke harshly to them
whereat they handled me more gently
near sundown we halted outside of the
felled timber and from the appearance of
the camp i estimated that fully two hundred
warriors were accommodated there shortly
after i had been tied to a tree two indians
arrived with the body of a dead indian on
a litter the man had been scalped

  his head rolled grotesquely as though his
neck had been broken but i could discover
no wounds upon him the tree breaker
had counted another extraordinary coup by
remembering he was of the bear clan st
luc stared at the dead man thoughtfully
then gave an order the litter was placed
at my feet this was the ottawa the oneida
had killed after i was captured

  by depositing the corpse at my feet i was
given to understand that i would be held
responsible that i must pay for three deaths
instead of two

chapter viii

the oneida brings a teade-belt

st luc kept away from me until he
had eaten nor did any of his evil brood
annoy me when he approached he came
alone his warriors keeping well back he

said

  i am filled with pain msieu to an-

nounce my braves are very angry over the
death of their friends i fear it will go hard
with you of course you must die but i
had hoped it would be something easy and
simple

  the black-hearted scoundrel this speech
was skilfully calculated to be the beginning
of my torture

  we morgans are very brave men we
do not seem to notice physical pain as do
most men i told him

  morgan he exclaimed not related
to general daniel morgan

  his brother i lied seized by the
inspiration to trade on one of the most
famous names of the republic

  he lost something of his aplomb and
twisted the ends of his beard and gnawed
them reflectively it was all very well to
cook an ordinary soldier in an ottawa
kettle but to use general morgans brother
thus might stir up a very far reaching retri-
bution

  what rank he snapped

  there was nothing in my rifle dress to
designate my rank and i replied

  a captain in morgans riflemen now
detailed for special service at the request of
general schuyler

  he continued chewing his beard and
entirely lost his air of mocking politeness
were i daniel morgans brother there
would be much pother made from burgoyne
down to guarantee me decent treatment
burgoyne was unable to save all the indians
prisoners from torture but he did what he
could after a few moments of moody
thought st luc said

  no one knows who you are no one
knows morgans brother has been captured
youve told me nothing im afraid that
captain morgan will be marked missing
on the rolls with no one ever the wiser as
to just how he ended his career

  you forget the oneida he will report
back to general schuyler about my cap-
ture a flag will be sent and information
requested from burgoyne the oneida is
as wise as he is brave

  may a thousand devils skin your oneida
ill give a barrel of rum to the indians who
bring in his hair

  america is not wide enough nor long
enough for you to hide if general morgan
knows you killed me by torture

  he simulated amusement and with a
laugh replied
the white dawn



  your general morgan will be running
to florida to hide himself when he hears of
general burgoynes great victory

  youve spoken a lie and you know it is
a lie and youve also made a foolish mis-
statement i told him he fumed and
indulged in a violent pantomime and
whetted the fears of the indians who
thought he was about to kill me off-hand
when he had subsided i went on

  general morgan never hides you
know that so you lied when you spoke of
florida burgoynes great victory is a
flash in the priming pan if he advances
he will be whipped

  in rich disgust st luc exclaimed

  zut either you are a fool or think
i am one whipped mon dieu who
is there to do the whipping

  disease and hunger will begin it the
american army will finish it i boldly
answered

  name of an ass well cut your comb
slowly my young cock for that talk whip
general burgoyne when already your rabble
of boys and sick men are caught between
him and general howe with colonel st
leger soon nipping in from the west
faugh well cook the silliness out of your
young bones

  howes troops have sailed for the chesa-
peake to try for philadelphia we do not
worry about st leger

  he stared at me thoughtfully trying
to decide how much of my talk he should
believe speaking slowly and with jeering
disdain he said-

  you say howe has sailed south when
we all know he is ordered to meet general
burgoyne at albany

  he could not disguise his uneasiness for
he was ever one to fight with the winner
we had captured ten men within thirty
days who had tried to pass through our
lines to howe in new york st lucs
bearing proved to my satisfaction that
the northern army had no suspicions as to
howes real plans i said

  i am fresh from new york howes
troops embarked several days ago he has
received no orders to cooperate with bur-
goyne

  he stripped a withe from a bush and
cleared it of leaves and then quietly said-
you puppy to talk such foolishness to
st luc de la corne

  he struck me several vicious blows

across the face each leaving a burning welt
the indians rushed forward to enjoy this
assault expecting it would lead to a richer
sport one man a brawny caughnawaga
mohawk carried a big kettle and called
out

  the children are hungry big brother
see they have a fire lighted he pointed

   the flames in te middle of the camp

  tell them they must first catch my
oneida i cried for if he escapes to tell
of my capture general burgoyne will be
angry that i was not brought to head-
quarters

   st luc motioned for the savages to halt
and puckered his brows in cogitation
around him stood his expectant followers
their eyes glistening but i had put two
obstacles in the way of an immediate killing
st luc might pretend to hold our army in
contempt but general morgan was not
a man to be disregarded the other de-
terrent was my statement concerning howes
movements if i spoke the truth it was of
prime importance that burgoyne should be
told if sir william had sailed for the
chesapeake instead of up the hudson then
there was a chance of the invading army
accomplishing but little

   st lucs knowledge of our north country
of the scattered settlements and scarcity of
food of the difficulty of maintaining a line
of supplies against the bushfighting of our
woodsmen easily permitted him to picture
a less rosy future for british arms i
believed he would have willingly postponed
my fate had it not been for the furious
demands of his indians

  a tall menominee pointed dramatically
at the dead savage at my feet and made an
impassioned plea a sioux chief who wore
a head-dress of feathers unlike any worn by
our eastern indians spoke next i could
not understand what he said but his mental
attitude toward me was shown when he
stuck his ax into the tree within an inch of
my head

   as if this were a signal the tree was now
surrounded by whooping yelling savages
their knives slicing the air close to my face
their axes thudding into the tree until my
body was fenced in with iron tomahawks
st luc shrugged his shoulders and stepped
back as though the situation had passed
beyond his control

   after all his only claim to power was his
leadership of the wild horde when they
io

adventure

could not be stopped from butchering
british wounded and scalping the most ar-
dent of the argyle tories why should i
expect him to fend them off from an ameri-
can prisoner

  the dancing ceased and the sioux chief
made a speech w ch had to do with his
war record for as he talked he touched the
feathers on his long head-dress each feather
standing for some notable coup a sac
began pounding the bottom of the kettle as
if it were a war-drum

  msieu can see i am helpless what will
you have when my children are so incorrigi-
ble called out st luc

  in gazing toward him my eyes discovered
a splotch of scarlet at the edge of the woods
a british soldier had wandered into the
scene and even as i saw him he threw up
his hands in disgust and turned to leave me
to my fate but i would not have it so
and scored on his conscience by yelling
englishman wait and see a welshman
die

at first i thought he would not
heed my cry but after some hesita-
tion he wheeled and strode into the
camp the savages became silent and eyed
him sullenly st luc was ill at ease for his
face twitched perceptibly beneath his
beard

  i am captain morgan brother of gen-
eral morgan i loudly announced your
red allies are about to boil me

  he was not more than twenty-two or four
and looked very brave in his gay uniform

  curse the luck captain what can i
do i am lieutenant levering of the ad-
vance corps general burgoyne himself
can only go about so far with these red
devils

  ah msieu says the true word sighed
st luc i reason i beg i plead but they
will not be denied a regiment of bayonets
can stop them yes but what about scouts
after they turn back to michilimackinac
ill give them four oxen and a hogshead
of rum for this man said the lieutenant
tell them that i have twenty guineas in
my chest for you sir

  a million devils take your guineas
snarled st luc how long since a boy
lieutenant can make gifts to st luc de la
corne as for your rum and oxen my
children will laugh at you they take all
drink and meat they want

  the lieutenant colored and his blue eyes
grew ominous yet he held himself well in
hand

  monsieur there are other prisoners for
your indians if they will but take to the
woods and find them this man is a brother
of general morgan he is an officer
and he was captured while trying to
assist what he supposed to be a wounded
man possibly an englishman i broke in
and added how st luc had fooled me
st luc grinned evilly the lieutenant
grimaced the frenchman pointed to the
dead indian and said

  the prisoners friend a bloody oneida
killed three of my ottawas lieutenant
levering my red children have their code
even as you have yours they must cover
their dead my ottawas firmly believe
they must do this or michibou the great
hare or namepich the carp or their third
god the bear will be displeased with them
they are droll in their notions but white
men have been much the same and fought
wars over their religions the other tribes
represented here feel the same

  yet monsieur you and i ought to be
able to circumvent them make them
liberal promises god knows we do not
feel any affection for morgans riflemen wrho
make a practice of shooting officers but
this man can not go to the kettle it would
be a stain on your honor monsieur gen-
eral morgan would make a rare reprisal
looking for you first monsieur

  bah that for morgan the welsh-
man jeered st luc snapping his fingers
but he did not mean it only st luc de
la corne and charles de langlade can
manage these wild men and we can go
only so far it is the fortune of war i
advise msieu to retire at once

  the young lieutenant was torn between
his great desire to aid me and his horror of
being a witness to what would appall the
stoutest heart his manhood would compel
him to remain with me until the last mo-
ment even though he be unable to help me
i said to him

  howe will not join burgoyne at albany

get these-to wait until you can take

that word to headquarters then youve
done all you can for me the rest will be
general burgoynes responsibility he will
be keen to question me about my knowledge
of howes plans i have been in new york
and i know the truth
the white dawn



  thus i baited my words with what all
new york knew by this time but which
burgoyne did not know my request af-
forded the lieutenant an honorable chance
to avoid witnessing my death and at the
same time suggested the only rational
course for saving my life

  by heavens captain morgan you shall
not die if these beggars will wait until i can
reach our general if the advance corps
were within hail wed have you out of this
fix and let the explanations come after-
wards

  msieu forgets its bad business to inter-
fere with my control of the indians
ominously spoke up st luc they do not
love the english so much that they will
suffer very much beware msieu and be
thankful they do not understand your
words go to your commander i will try
to keep them quiet for twenty-four hours
but if you meet your corps do not bring it
here for i will not be responsible for the
bloody heads they will wear

  bloody heads angrily cried the lieu-
tenant there are not enough of these
red scum in america to give the advance
corps any concern but remember the
twenty-four hours and longer if no word
comes from burgoyne by then

  turning to me levering patted my shoul-
der and tried to smile encouragement i
felt most grateful to him and would have
liked to take his hand he was english
and i was welsh and an accident of geogra-
phy had set us against each other eager to
whip and kill before we had seen each other
now that i was in the toils he felt nothing
but friendship and sympathy for me and
would i knew do his utmost to succor me
what grim irony that such warm fellowship
could not have been experienced before the
quarrel began

  he hurried from the camp to find some
one with authority and the power to enforce
it he left st luc in a villainous humor
the englishmans manner sat heavy on the
frenchman the assurance the uncon-
scious air of superiority and the racial
difference between them worked my captor
up to a white heat of venom and i was the
only object he could vent his rage upon
the indians had remained silent staring
at their white leader st luc appreciating
the red mans grasp of dramatic values
struck a haughty pose at last he addressed
me saying-

  general burgoyne can not afford to lose
his red allies for the sake of saving one white
enemy

  general morgans brother can not be
tortured without every one of his riflemen
taking an oath to run down st luc de la
corne

  i have been thinking of that msieu
he frankly confessed i do not believe
any one would care to follow me beyond
michilimackinac however then again
there is no certainty the oneida knows that
i had a hand in your capture and if he
does there is no certainty he will live to take
the news to schuyler what is told to
burgoyne amounts to nothing when it is
too late he will keep very quiet i have
a hundred warriors out under charles de
langlade hunting for your red brother if
he can escape from de langlade he is a mas-
ter at woodcraft he has no gun only
a knife and an ax

  and his hands and arms i added
the first indian he killed was with his
hands and arms he is not called the tree
breaker for nothing he kills like a bear
your vermin will never dance his scalp
perhaps not if they hunted him without
langlade but the man who was cunning
enough to destroy braddock msieu will
find the task of running down one indian
to be very simple yet i am a cautious
man msieu  i will have my children
wait a bit

  facing his warriors he spoke to them at
some length their impassive faces be-
trayed no emotion but after he had finished
and had listened to a few short responses he
told me

  it was very close to failure msieu
morgan you have been shaking hands
with death while i talked it is only be-
cause i made them believe langlade would
wish to be present when you burn that they
consented to wait until morning by then
i shall know about the oneida if he
is hit in the head they can take you and
welcome i care nothing for burgoynes
feelings

  but if the oneida is not captured or
killed by morning

  he pursed his lips for a moments de-
liberation then decided

  then theyll have you just the same
only i will leaye the camp and say it all
happened against my orders and in my
absence in that way every one will save


adventure

his face and the blame put upon my irre-
sponsible red children

  leaving only general morgan to be dealt
with

  im not afraid of morgan he will
blame burgoyne

  he lied he was afraid of daniel morgan
but he believed morgan could never reach
him in the michilimackinac country tn
postponing my death until the morrow he
granted me no favor beyond a few more
hours of painful anticipation it would
be impossible for lieutenant levering to
reach burgoyne and set about my rescue
before sunrise burgoyne would be at
skenesborough or close to it woods travel
would be slow and the lieutenant was no
woodsman

  at least have this dead indian removed
and allow me to sit down i asked

with much politeness st luc
himself unfastened the thongs which
held me to the tree after i had
slumped into a sitting posture he had the
indians take the dead warrior to one side
had others bring me water and a wooden
platter of fair beef nor did he forget
a pinch of salt that night they extended
my arms and feet and tied them to four
saplings

  they placed a small sapling across my
body and a warrior slept on each end of it
my slightest movement brought my guards
to a sitting posture their war-axes raised
i slept none for my dread of the morning
was terrible i hope i am not more of a
physical coward than the average man but
to lie there helpless to know i was sur-
rounded by ferocious foes to realize there
was an ordeal which i must endure before
receiving the mercy of death nagged my
mind to the verge of insanity

  the camp was astir at an early hur and
st luc came and stood to look down on me
my manhood returned as pride urged me
to remember the brave fellows who called
me friend i kept telling myself that there
was a maximum of physical pain and that
once i endured it the savages could torment
me no further st lucs greeting was
malicious he said-

  i fear msieu did not rest well last
night

  the sapling bore heavily on my chest
it annoyed me

  he bowed and gave an order to my

guards they released my aching limbs
and allowed me to sit with my back against
the tree

  how much grace do i have i asked
striving to speak with unconcern

  i fear only an hour from his deep
sigh one might have imagined he was ex-
tremely sorry langlade has not come in
i go to look for him i shall command my
children not to distrub msieu while i am
away but msieu knows how playful and
unreliable indians are still we will hope
for the best

  i only hope that general morgan
catches you before burgoynes army is
turned back

  msieu has the rich fancy in wishing
he said with a smirk but i forget i am
the host

  he went to the nearest fire and soon the
sioux with the long head-dress came and
placed beef and a tin dipper of water beside
me he must have been a big war-chief in
his nation and his personal attendance on
my wants evidenced the certainty of my
fate he stood and watched me eat and
said something i could not understand
the guard who had released one of my
hands and who remained squatting on his
haunches close by me interpreted

  black cloud says you will die like
a brave man that your scalp will be dried
on a black hoop because you are a soldier
he says that the inside will be painted
green with red on it to show you died by
fire

  i do not believe that any normal man
has an appetite for food when facing a vio-
lent death it did not need the sioux
warriors words to plunge me in mental
misery i had suffered that all night the
sight of the food nauseated me yet i was
being sharply watched for some sign of
weakness i have ever held the white race
is superior to all other races only so long as
it maintains a superiority of deportment

  if our religion and upbringing can not
afford us the boon of dying like men if our
mental supremacy can not more than make
up for the savages insensibility to physical
pain then our civilization is inferior to that
of the iroquois who knew not that david
said i will fear no evil

  because of what i owed to my blood and
the teachings of the psalmist i did endeavor
to bear myself bravely and did force myself
to eat the beef and ask for more of the
the white dawn

ill

water i could not get enough on return-
ing with my second helping the sioux chief
declared

  this is a brave man his people will
never hang their heads his women will
tell his children how he died the mohawk
interpreted this

  i finished eating and the indians about
their fires bolted the last mouthfuls in their
impatience to witness how an american
could die st luc had stood at one side
while i ate and nodded in approval when
i sent back my platter for more now he
walked to the middle of the camp and
briefly harangued the red men and then
made a pretense of departing but i could
see the bushes move where he remained to
watch secretly the torture left to the
mercies of the warriors i was courteously
addressed by a caughnawaga who request-
ed me to stand up while they arranged the
post the post was the tree to which i had
been tied this was trimmed to a height of
twelve feet when they had finished i
called the caughnawagas attention to the
stump of a small branch and asked that it
be smoothed off

  with a blow of his ax he did as i asked
and then shouted to his own people

  ho ho a brave man will die this
morning a very brave man will do us
honor

  this was repeated in various tongues
until all the savages understood and their
war axes were raised in salute to my sturdy
bearing but i took no glory in my role for
i was maintaining it only by will power
but will power is a fickle thing and may be
routed at any moment so i concentrated
on the twenty-third psalm and held my
mind to it

  when they had finished with the tree
i stepped to it of my own accord anxious
to have it all finished before i should break
down that was the crevice in my armor
i had not practised faith and i feared i was
unmanly in waiting until in the last ex-
tremity before asking for help i never had
the respect for the eleventh hour worker
in the vineyard that i had for him who came
in the early morning yet the tardy worker
was paid but i humanized the almighty

  i saw him from my own poor little plane
the indians had me there was not the
slightest chance of escaping strange fatu-
ity of the human mind if i could dis-
cover an opportunity to escape i would give

god the credit with death inevitable i
doubted his omnipotence yet i mouthed
the psalm over and over and found it some-
thing to cling to if only to dull my mind
and i slipped the rope of rawhide around
my wrists and told the mohawk to tie it
and throw the loose end over a branch fif-
teen feet above my head and make it fast

 whereat the caughnawaga struck the
flat of his ax lightly against his bps as
though amazed and cried

 this man is a chief this man is
a sachem with a very brave heart the
warrior who eats of his heart will be a very
brave man ho he is greater than a
sachem roy ana

  in pronouncing this the highest term
of respect an iroquois can bestow he held
his ax above his head until every brown
arm was similarly extended holding either
ax or knife

  they were sincere in this tribute and
through my intense concentration on da-
vids song stretched the desire to maintain
my show of hardihood to the end i have
always tried to believe that had the horrid
affair proceeded i should have borne myself
fittingly no man can say how he will
carry himself under similar circumstances
i have known rough rude ignorant bor-
derers who went through hell to their
release with a smile and a taunt for their
tormentors i have been told of their stout
hearts by their admiring executioners who
spoke of them with respect aye even with
awe and who saluted their memories with
uplifted ax and royanal

  i try to believe that for the sake of my
name and race i too would have endured
the devilish torture so as to warrant a like
remembrance of me on the part of the iro-
quois but i do not know i do not know
one should not wait until the storm breaks
before kindling the fires of faith i do know

that when the- slowly approaching the

heaped up brushwood with lighted faggot
was halted by a loud cry from the edge of
the forest there came a physical reaction
that turned my legs to strings and would
have revealed me in a sorry plight had not
all heads been turned toward the new-
comer

  it was the tree breaker the oneida ah
he was the man who should have been
greeted as royana in honor of his brave
heart should the hundred axes have been
sent spinning to catch the first kiss of the


adventure

 sunbeams for he came alone unarmed
 his extended hands holding wampum

   he ignored me and my circle of unlighted
 brush he walked toward the savages with
 head held high his carriage as haughty as
 that of a mohawk wandering alone into
 an abnaki village on the penobscot to
 dictate to hundreds of warriors what
 tribute they must pay to the long house

 i had my blood and he had his and he
 measured up to the situation with a calm
 yet audacious courage i could never hope
 to possess not a savage of the various
 tribes sought to lay a hand on him or
 hurl a weapon

   their eyes burned as they stared at his
 hideously painted face in the counte-
 nances of the caughnawagas once of the
 new york mohawks there flickered ad-
 miration for the man he came to a halt
 and the indians quietly arranged them-
 selves in several lines before him st luc
 ran from cover panting with excitement
 and swinging a french ax he did not
 stop until before the oneida he read the
  mans clan from the symbolic painting on
 the chest and from the imitation of claw
 scratches on the face with a howl of
 exultation he raised his ax

   the oneida did not move a muscle that
 i could see except that his eyes darted
 a question at the canadian mohawks and
 one of them caught the uplifted ax and
 held it another explained to the infuriated
 frenchman

   he is a bearer of belts we will hear
 him

 jp j st luc puffed and panted but
 reason at last returned and re-
 i i linquishing his ax he pretended to
 discover for the first time the nature of the
 oneidas business

   let the oneida speak h grunted

   the tree breaker apparently did not
 hear him a mohawk said

   let the man of the bear clan speak
 he brings a talk he has belts we will
 hear him

   the lines of warriors sank to a sitting
 posture a mohawk brought forward
 a robe and spread it before the oneida
 the tree breaker folded his arms and
 stared at the sky for five minutes and no
 man moved or spoke then his powerful
 voice began

   sachems and warriors let this wam-

 pum open your ears to hear the truth so
 you may grow very wise

  he placed on the robe three strings or
a small belt he continued

  sachems and warriors some of you
come from the setting sun to kill the women
and children of the americans some of
you were brothers of the keepers of the
eastern door of the long house before
they tore up by the roots the great tree at
albany to which was fastened the chain of
friendship offered by the thirteen fires
and long before that when the great coun-
cil fire burned at onondaga you french
mohawks who came down from canada
with the english have killed more women
and children than you have killed soldiers

  this trouble between the great father
over the water and his children of the
thirteen fires is a family trouble and you
should keep your axes in your belts even
as the oneidas did but you stick your
axes in the heads of women and children
and some of the oneidas find a red ax stick-
ing out of the ground and pick it up you
would torture a brave man after a white
man caught him

  he dropped a black belt on the robe
this insolent accusation of cowardice
caused the savage lips to tighten but
while the oneida waited for his words to be
interpreted to the western indians there
was not a visage that did not reflect pro-
found admiration then he resumed
sachems and warriors i come here
without a path-belt i come bringing no
white wampum i come with no bag of
peace talk i bring this for the men of the
ottawa nation

  he placed on the robe three belts of wam-
pum the usual algonquin price for a pris-
oners life no ottawa offered to pick up
the belts the oneida after a brief pause
continued

  i bring this for the sioux and their
neighbors he pulled a cord encircling
his neck until an indian pipe that had
hung down his back was resting on his
deep chest it was richly decorated with
feathers each feather being symbolic and
only understood perhaps by the bearer
and the western indians as the latter
pass pipes instead of belts removing
the cord the oneida placed the pipe on
the robe a sioux warrior seated near
bent over it and examined it with grave
attention but did not touch jt when
the white dawn

ii

he gave place others of his nation studied
it carefully but none offered to touch it

  the belts he had displayed looked to me
like  ttawa wampum i always believed he
procured them from some warrior or
warriors he had slain i also believed st
lucs indians knew this to be the fact and
admired him the more for it i never got
the truth from the tree breaker although
i later questioned him about the belts he
could be amazingly deaf at times and usu-
ally so when there seemed no reason for
reticence

  as for the pipe i recognized it as his own
he had fitted a long reed stem to it to
accommodate the decorations without
glancing in my direction my friend said
they say you have a white man a brave
man prisoner they say you would tor-
ture him and put him in a kettle the three
belts for the ottawa the pipe for the sioux
i offer for his life

  he waited several minutes then a mo-
hawk also of the bear clan rose and with
much dignity replied

  sachem we saw a very brave man be-
fore you came he will not make us feel
ashamed when he dies now we see two
very brave men

  ho ho two very brave men cried
the iroquois

  the mohawk continued

  sachem it is a brave man who comes to
us when his business is not to make peace
between himself and the warriors he visits
it is a brave man who even when he seeks
peace comes without a path-belt that
man will look death in the face and be not
afraid sachem we have looked at the
wampum and the pipe we have had
prisoners we would sell now we have
much wampum the western indians have
many pipes we do not want either
wampum or pipes

  ho ho two brave men will die
each man will try to be brave as the other
honor is done the long house and the
western tribes

  this was translated for the benefit of
the western indians and st luc in the
background too wise to interrupt the cere-
mony softly beat his hands together in
great glee the oneida had come without
a safe-conduct he came neither to seek
peace for his people nor to offer the savages
any advantage in exchange for my life
there was nothing attending his coming

which could protect him from the fury of
his enemies yet he stood with arms
folded his lips slightly curled in contempt
after the shouting had ceased and the
indians were settled down to wait with
breathless interest his next move each step
in the drama being most keenly enjoyed by
all the tree breaker spurned the pipe and
the strings of wampum and drew from his
girdle something which he held enclosed in
his two muscular hands

  sachems and warriors he said the
ottawas have refused the three belts their
price when they have a prisoner to sell
the sioux and their friends refuse the pipe
with its feathers from the eagle the owl the
woodpecker and duck who are chiefs of the
day the night the forests and the waters
the oneida has no more wampum nor
pipes for them now here is a trade-belt
for the frenchman who they say caught
a brave man by a trick

  with that he held up a belt of leather of
french make it meant nothing to me but
the moment st luc beheld it he gave a
little snarling cry and ran forward and in
violation of all indian etiquet snatched it
from the oneidas hand heads twisted
eyes rolled but no indian rose

  sachems and warriors it is the belt of
charles langlade the tree breaker holds
him prisoner now you know why the
oneida comes here without a path-belt
if i do not go away from here very soon
langlade will die de la corne has taken
my trade-belt to look at it and see if it is
a good trade-belt wolves are howling on
the mountains and in the woods they will
not wait for night they will come down
very soon to eat the dead and helpless
does de la come return the belt to the
robe or does he keep it and save his white
brothers life i have spoken

  there was a surging and heaving through-
out the squatting semi-circle and the red
men came to their feet and howled like the
wolves that tree breaker had represented
as about to devour langlade the ends of
the half circle came together and the oneida
was surrounded by the infuriated warriors
axes were held over his head knives were
thrust within an inch of his eyes arrows
were drawn to the head impassive as the
tree to which i was tied he stood and stared
vacantly into the grimacing faces when
he spoke it was calmly to say

  strike me-and kill langlade i have
h

adventure

killed three of you between two sleeps

i shall not count your dead for they were
squaws one i killed with my empty
hands just as the bear kills by crushing
i am unarmed strike and feed lang-
lade to the wolves

  the howling ceased abruptly the indi-
ans gave ground until the oneida stood in
the center of a cleared circle st luc stood
just outside the circle still staring blankly
at the langlades leather belt to him the
indians turned for council a mohawk
cried

  the little father must not die he led
the attack on fort william henry

  an ottawa stood forth and shouted
vehemently and i caught it when the
mohawk translated it to the eastern indians
black cloud says the little father must
not die he killed the big chief braddock
and stuck the ax into many heads

  st luc strode inside the ring and con-
fronted the oneida saying

  warrior of the bear clan of the oneida
you come here without a path-belt you
defy these chiefs and warriors you are
a very brave man you say this belt is
langlades how do we know you speak
with a straight tongue

  if he thought to tempt the oneida into
any revelations which might suggest schemes
for langlades immediate release he was
disappointed the indian gave him no
heed the savages pressed about st luc
and fingered the belt eagerly through
a double thickness of the leather the rivet-
ing tacks formed a fleur-de-lis and the
letters c l there was no mistaking the
belt the indians identified it with little
grunts i do not know what measure of
friendship existed between st luc and
de langlade but i do know that st luc
would rather lose a nation of his red allies
than to lose the man who helped to plot
braddocks destruction st luc addressed
the savages in their several dialects asking-
my children what shall we do with this
trade-belt shall we give the white pris-
oner in exchange for the little father
their cruel eyes were focused on me
longingly then turned to glare at the
oneida still i was only a white man and
there would be many such to torture the
oneida might lose his medicine next time
and be captured there was only one
little father

  after a considerable silence a menominee

spoke up his speech was repeated by
the sioux and sacs i could not under-
stand what they said no more than when
the ottawas registered their decision but
when the canadian mohawks spoke i drew
my first free breath for the spokesman said-
we must have the little father with us
to the oneida st luc said

  we pick up the trade-belt we keep it
a life for a life but how do we know
langlade is unharmed go and bring him
when he walks into this camp your white
friend shall be set free

  the oneida looked at him scornfully but
did not speak st luc angrily demanded-
you will not trust us to set the white
man free

  no the white man goes with me
before night langlade will walk into this
place i have said it

  why should we trust you if you will not
trust us passionately cried st luc

  there is but one road for you to travel
when there are two roads you can stop and
say i will follow this road it is smooth
the other road is filled with briars and
sharp stones now there is but one road
ask the canadian mohawks who left
their ancient homes many moons ago to
live with the french to fight against the
english in the french war ask them if
a chief of the oneidas a man of the bear
clan is to be believed if my white brother
goes with me now langlade will come to
you before the sun goes to sleep i have
spoken

  st luc much worried walked to one
side and conferred with the leading men of
the various tribes when he returned to
the oneida i knew my fate was settled
either for the stake or for freedom the
frenchman harshly announced

  the white man is yours take him
and go some of my braves will go with
you to help langlade walk here

  my white brother goes alone with me
langlade can walk alone

  this refusal of an escort had been antici-
pated for although he clawed at his beard
st luc did not consutt his followers before
replying

  let it be so he said but if langlade
does not come here unharmed there are not
enough woods nor deep places in the earth
to hide you from us

  a foolish bird is talking jeered the
oneida or the wind is blowing when
the white dawn

ii

did the tree breaker ever grow afraid at
the empty whistling of the wind or the
howling of a mountain wolf bears do not
turn aside for wolves

  he came to me and with a small knife
from his girdle he cut me loose instead of
hurrying me away he faced the baffled pack
and said

  my white brother says he can not walk
without his gun we are waiting the
wolves are howling and creeping down the
mountain there is no bear to keep them
from langlade

  with a snort of rage st luc spoke the
word which produced my rifle the shot-
pouch and powder-horn not until i re-
ceived my property back did the oneida
turn and stalk slowly toward the forest
as we passed the frenchman he glared
murderously and hissed epithets at us
but when we walked by the massed savages
their stern faces showed no resentment and
the gleam in their eyes was one of approval
of the oneidas proud mien and great
courage first one then another then all
raised their axes in salute to him and the
mohawk gave the signal for the hoarsely
shouted-  roy anal

  the savor of their praise was sweeter
than life in the nostrils of my friend

while hot to reach the woods and
make good my escape although
i knew the indians would not back
out of their bargain i was forced to accom-
modate my pace to the tree breakers
and he loitered along most carelessly but
once we had passed inside the green wall
he darted his glance to all points of the
compass and surprized me by taking an
old trail leading south one that was well
beaten and would leave no signs and be-
ginning to run rapidly

  i followed at his heels glad to place
much distance between us and the enemy
yet disturbed by the chiefs great haste
fully four miles did we cover at a sharp
trot when my friend halted and motioning
me to be cautious daintily picked his way
to one side and crouched down in the
undergrowth perhaps only a minute
passed but it seemed a dozen when we
heard the soft fall of moccasined feet and
through the lace-work of the boughs i
caught a glimpse of a white man running
at a dog-trot

  he wore acanadian hat of gay color and

a red sash and his hair was streaked with
gray behind him filed fully four score
indians the foot of each falling on the spot
trod on by the man ahead a jumble of
wild questions rose to my tongue but the
oneida kept his hand on my knee for
silence after the last warrior had passed
we yet waited to make sure there were no
laggards then we stole back to the trail
and the oneida whispered

  if my white brother does not wish to
eat fire let him keep close to me we have
until those men reach the camp

  they are tired they have run a long
distance they will not go very fast
i said who is the white man
langlade

  his answer put springs into my heels and
i urged him to quicken his pace but he
held to his steady swinging stride

  langlade i softly cried after him
then he has escaped

  not from the tree breaker he was
not my prisoner

  but you said--

  my orenda put strange words into my
mouth so i might save my white brother
i talked to the sioux who are snakes and
i used a crooked tongue i talked to the
ottawas who are wild men and talk only
with evil spirits to speak with a crooked
tongue to them is wise an owl in which
was the spirit of my grandfather told me to
do it the french mohawks went to live
with the priests and desert their brothers in
new york i owe them nothing lang-
lade sent his indians chasing me i dou-
bled back to surprize him in his camp he
was gone but i found his belt i scouted
the camp where my brother was tied up to
be roasted before going into the kettle
langlade was out in the woods hunting for
me so i took my trade-belt to st luc
he is a very foolish man

  you risked all that to save me you
came when you knew langlade might come
at any time

  they were like children the white
one is my brother

  by heavens tree breaker they did well
to call you royana

  my tribute pleased him his shoulders
braced back his invasion of the camp
would be talked about from the mohawk to
michilimackinac he slowed down and
tilted his head i did likewise but could
hear nothing
n

adventure

  they are very angry he quietly in-
formed me the next man they catch
must be very brave not to show he is
afraid now they know langlade was
never taken by the tree breaker

  but four miles they never had time
to make that distance i demurred

  they sent men to scout after us they
met langlade now they are howling to
tell st luc they will be after us very
soon but the bear is cunning he leaves
his scratches on a tree but when does the
hunter see him men live and die old men
without meeting a bear in the woods unless
they catch him in a hole

  i hear nothing i protested

  he jerked his head and half closed his
eyes once more i concentrated on listen-
ing then i caught it a thin pulsating cry
coming from no particular direction the
pack were seeking the scent and never

again would it do for me to be taken alive
the oneida resumed running and at the
end of a mile stopped and began hunting
at the foot of a spruce he drew forth his
ax and knife and paint bag now we will
run he said

  he was off like the wind and i had all
i could do to keep within a rod of him be-
hind us a hundred warriors were speeding
along the various trails spreading through
the woods to investigate snug hiding places
behind them a hundred travel-weary braves
were coming waiting for their second wind
st luc would seek to cut me off from sur-
rendering myself to the british at skenes-
borough from escaping west to fort
edward and he would send some of his
swiftest runners south for his scouts had
dogged our steps long enough to know we
started in that direction

  the hunt seemed all but over for us

        t was the isola marus maiden
voyage she was nine days out of
yokohama and fourteen hours out
of honolulu fair skies a sea of
glass and faultless turbines had conspired to
make the voyage uneventful from the first
mrs l apworth meredith had suffered from
the tedium of the long pacific passage shuf-
fle-board deck quoits and all the other hun-
dred and one inventions of travel-weary voy-
agers had from long association become
classed as imbecilic in the mind of mrs mer-
edith ocean travel was to her a matter of
pure business

  by other names and in different personali-
ties mrs meredith had sailed the seven
seas to captain juggins of the tramp
ulysses who had brought her as passenger
from cape town around the horn to rio
and from there to boston u s a she was
the daughter of a missionary whose life of
privation and sacrifice had earned for him
at last the full burial rites of a zulu chief-
tain captain svensen of the swedish karl
gustav would have remembered her as
a russian princess making a tour of the
world without the formalities of a numerous
attending suite at present she posed as
the widow of a gallant british officer some
months deceased and in her presumably
shallow memory almost forgotten in
cabin and saloon it was rumored that her
period of mourning was over that her
widows weeds worn as a caterpillar wears
its cocoon would soon be cast aside allow-
ing her to burst forth a butterfly of fashion
and mrs meredith took pains to foster this
impression by a number of mild flirtations

with the most prepossessing among the
male passengers

  in the shade of the promenade decks
wide canvas awning mrs meredith half-
sat half-reclined in her steamer chair her
attention centered on two men shipboard
acquaintances who were seated at oppo-
site sides of a cloth-covered card-table play-
ing chess a steward had brought the table
and chessmen from the smoking-room hours
before and the two men had been playing
steadily since luncheon

  mrs meredith had always thought of the
ancient pastime as the slowest of all games
a sort of mental gymnastics requiring long
study and more than ordinary intelligence
before it could be mastered but these two
combatants of the checkered field played as
if they were driven by a mad spirit of haste
each player moved in turn but move
followed move with bewildering rapidity
out of curiosity mrs meredith had counted
the number of times that the contestants
had reset the pieces and to her certain
knowledge they had played more than
thirty games since she had begun to keep
tally

from time to time during the afternoon
promenaders had paused to watch the chess-
play and once she had heard a man say-
rapid-fire chess interesting and some-
times brilliant

  he had spoken as one having authority
on the subject of chess and she had noted
how the older of the two contestants
watched the speaker out of the corner of one
eye as he passed on along the deck

  both chess-players were known by name




adventure

to mrs meredith the younger of the
two barney coburn she had danced with
on several occasions and knew him to be
what he represented himself-a junior
attache of the american legation in peking
the other an older man had been pointed
out to her as a mr blodwen a prosperous
american with interests in the chinese
leather trade

  a shrewd judge of men this character-
ization had not satisfied mrs meredith as
to the mans real business on board the
isota since leaving honolulu where
certain information relative to blodwens
affairs had reached her ears she had per-
sistently sought his acquaintance she had
secured an introduction but blodwen did
not dance preferring the company of the
smoking-room to that of the ships parlors
mrs meredith knew nothing of the game of
chess but if knowledge of that particular
pastime would promote relationship with
blodwen that knowledge she resolved to
acquire much could happen in the five
days that would elapse before the isota
reached the golden gate

  the afternoon had sped more quickly
than mrs meredith had thought possible
and she was surprized when the declining
sun began to peep beneath the edge of the
deck awning its rays slanted into the eyes
of blodwen who sat with his back against
the white wall of the cabin facing the un-
ruffled sea he looked up in annoyance

  had enough frank asked his com-
panion noticing blodwens distracted atten-
tion

  for this afternoon answered the older
man glancing at his watch and rising
suddenly from the table

  he lifted his gray tweed cap and bowed
slightly to mrs meredith who had been
sitting at his elbow all the afternoon and
whom he now noticed for the first time

  you havent looked at me for hours
mr blodwen said the widow reproach-
fully

  astonishing that beauty should have
been so near and i unaware of its presence
he replied with banal gallantry

  that compliment bald as it was has
earned your pardon laughed mrs mere-
dith you were so absorbed in your chess
that it took the sun himself to rouse you
from it i am almost tempted to ask you
to teach me such a fascinating game

  her tone was just serious enough to call

for a serious reply and blodwen rose to the
occasion as a trout in an untroubled pool
rises to the carefully tossed fly of the angler

  the game is fascinating he said po-
litely and if you really care to learn the
moves i shall be glad to show you after
dinner

  he was not averse to a prolonged tete-
a-tete with the charming widow even though
he had observed the carefully hidden wrin-
kles at the corners of her eyes that told
him mrs meredith was older than she
wished to appear as far as age was con-
cerned he himself was no longer young
despite his upright carriage his black hair
and keen eyes there was an air of sophisti-
cation of self-assuredness about the man
that made mrs meredith estimate his age
at somewhere in the forties

  blodwens hair betrayed a certain van-
ity for it was not his own even an
expert would have looked twice however
before discovering the fact that he wore a
wig

  the call to dinner interrupted her accep-
tance of blodwens invitation and it was
later in the evening before she saw him
again the promenade deck had been
cleared of steamer chairs and a dance was
in progress the soft strains of a waltz
floated to the ears of blodwen as he leaned
idly against the steamers rail just aft of the
bridge and watched the thin wisp of smoke
from his cigar drift in wavy lines toward the
stern of the isota a crescent moon hang-
ing low in the western sky silvered the mill-
pond calm of the pacific with a broad path
of beauty that stretched from the steamers
rail to the far horizon

  the isota seemed to glide through the
dividing waters with scarcely a whisper
from the white line of foam rushing smooth-
ly past the black hull twenty feet below
where he stood only the relentless throb
of mighty heart-beats told of the driving
force that urged the vessel onward lulled
by the calm serenity of the night blodwen
forgot for the first time during the voyage
the little oilskin packet pinned to the inside
pocket of his vest

  the clear tones of a womans voice
startled him from his reverie

  i have come to claim your promise of
this afternoon

  he turned quickly mrs meredith stood
at his elbow with a quick motion he
tossed his half-smoked cigar overboard
the double thirteen



  you need not have done that she pro-
tested i dont object to cigar-smoke
so you are really in earnest about learn-
ing to play chess asked blodwen

  certainly why not do you consider
me too stupid

  no no not that your request sur-
prized me because i thought that your
taste for amusement favored more active
pastimes

  you thought that i had rather dance
for instance

  something like that yes

  thanks for your candor but really
your games with mr coburn this afternoon
completely fascinated me i feel that i
simply must learn chess

  the game is difficult

  i am not frightened

  then when would you like to begin
  now

  blodwen was surprized at mrs mere-
diths haste he had taught chess to many
people but he had never found a woman so
eager to learn the game he glanced at
his watch

  it is already nine oclock he said
then the sooner we start the better
that is unless you repent of your bargain
blodwen laughed negatively and offered
his arm side by side they descended the
broad companionway iifto one of the isotas
brilliantly lighted parlors a steward was
dispatched to bring chessboard and men
from the smoking-room while mrs mere-
dith and blodwen seated themselves at
opposite sides of a small mahogany table
to await his return

  the cabin furnishings of the isota were
as new as the ship itself tapestries rugs
pictures and bric-a-brac proclaimed by
their spotlessness a recent origin even
the rosewood box brought by the steward
and its contents of ebony and boxwood
chessmen were new the green-and-white
chessboard shone in its first coat of virgin
varnish

  how gallant they look commented
mrs meredith as blodwen arranged the
pieces on their proper squares

  he recalled the battered chessmen that
he had seen in the chess clubs of the world
and smiled ironically

  in a few months he remarked the
knights will be noseless the battlements of
the rooks will be chipped off and the pawns
will have grown dingy with much handling

these little armies so spotless now will
soon become dilapidated and disreputable

  mrs meredith gave a little shiver of
annoyance

  b-r-r-r she exclaimed you make
me think of time and death cheer up
and tell me their names again

  blodwen laughed and cast aside the feel-
ing of oppression that had suddenly come
over him as he entered the cabin chess
was a favorite pastime with him and he
exerted himself to make it so with mrs
meredith he explained carefully the
powers of the pieces their manner of mov-
ing gave illustrations of check and
checkmate and grew more and more
surprized to find mrs meredith an eager
and attentive pupil

  time passed quickly the influx of
passengers into the cabin told that the
evenings dance was over he looked ques-
tioningly at mrs meredith but she shook
her head

   please dont stop yet she pleaded

  mrs merediths maid came and stood
behind her mistress she was young and
of the type known as dressy her prox-
imity seemed to exasperate mrs meredith

  go away you distract my attention
she said petulantly  stand behind mr
blodwen see if you can make him ner-
vous

  obediently the girl carried out her mis-
tress order blodwen glanced up the
maids face seemed unnaturally pale in the
light of the cabin lamps but except for that
he hardly noticed her the three were alone
in the parlor now blodwen glanced at his
watch it was one oclock

  just one more game begged mrs
meredith if you give me your queen
again i think i can almost beat you

  blodwen smiled agreeably and assembled
the pieces the maid who had remained
standing behind him shifted her position
slightly a subtle perfume oddly familiar
stole from her hair or clothing what was
there about the smell that reminded him of
a hospital ward

  the air in the cabin seemed close he
was becoming drowsy in spite of himself
his head nodded he roused sufficiently to
see if mrs meredith had observed his
sleepiness her blond head was bent for-
ward her eyes intent on the chessboard

blodwen drew a long breath decidedly
there was something wrong with the cabins


adventure

ventilation he thought that the girl be-
hind him had moved nearer did he dream
or had her soft arm stolen around his neck

it was daylight when blodwen
opened his eyes he was in his own
stateroom fully dressed lying awk-
wardly half in half out of his berth his
cabin door stood open and on the threshold
a japanese steward bowed politely

  a wireless for the mr blodwen he
said extending an envelope

  blodwens brain cleared rapidly in-
stinctively he knew what had happened
as a matter of form he felt for the oilskin
packet that should have reposed in the
inside pocket of his vest although he knew
beforehand that the package would be
missing

  with the certainty of his loss came re-
turning strength he sprang suddenly to
his feet and confrpnted the steward

  look boy he demanded who
brought me here lastnight

  the japanese startled from his smiling
complacency shrugged his shoulders and
shook his head negatively

  i find the mr blodwens key in the door
just now

  assured by the boys attitude that he
spoke the truth and knew nothing of the
nights happenings blodwen made no
attempt to question him further but took
the envelope that the steward still patiently
extended toward him he tore it open
three short sentences stretched across the
sheet

    a mrs meredith aboard she may know
  of the double thirteen watch out

  blodwen smiled ironically the warning
had come too late

  the effects of the drug that had robbed
him of consciousness were not lasting for
he found himself steady on his feet and
his active brain raced with plans for the
recovery of his property he faced the
situation with calmness indulging in no
self-recrimination his carelessness had
brought its own punishment

  for a moment his thoughts dwelt on mrs
meredith it was perfectly plain to him
now that behind her desire to learn the
game lurked an ulterior motive now that
she had accomplished her object she would
turn to other forms of amusement it
would have surprized him to know that

mrs meredith had that morning borrowed
from the ships library a volume of hoyle
containing a section devoted to the royal
pastime which together with the chessmen
she had taken to her stateroom

  without questioning the steward further
blodwen sought the captain of the ship

  captain matsu commanding officer of
the isota a graduate of oxford with an
inordinate pride in his english university
training acknowledged blodwens self-in-
troduction with a perfect imitation of
a britons bluntness and listened imper-
turifebly to his story

  slightly excited blodwen was neverthe-
less calm enough to place his facts before
the captain in logical sequence

  to begin with he said i represent the
firm of pendergast  hartley diamond
importers of new york city my position
with them is that of confidential agent or
buyer i buy diamonds

  acting under instructions from my
firm i recently purchased from the russian
princess marya mamontovna the diamond
necklace known as the double thirteen
this necklace composed of twenty-six
small but perfectly matched and flawless
diamonds is justlycelebrated as one of the
worlds finest i carried it in an oilskin
envelope pinned to the inside pocket of my
vest last night the necklace was stolen

  captain matsus face had not changed
expression during blodwens brief recital
but now he smiled in a manner meant to be
sympathetic

  well he asked as blodwen hesitated

  blodwen blushed it humiliated him to
have to tell how easily he had been tricked
but he continued his narrative

  i had been playing chess in the cabin
with mrs meredith one of the passengers
and as it was late i had grown sleepy-so
sleepy in fact that i could hardly keep my
eyes open mrs merediths maid stood
behind my chair and now in the light of
after events i am convinced that she was
slowly and skilfully drugging my senses
with some powerful narcotic at any rate
i gradually lost consciousness and have no
further recollection of what took place
i awoke this morning in my stateroom with
a steward calling my name and offering me
this

  he handed the marconigram to the
captain

  the japanese officers face wrinkled into
the double thirteen



a frown he looked up from the message
to study his passenger more carefully
blodwens jaw was squared with determina-
tion his eyes sparkled with subdued
passion

  the captain realized that in spite of the
simple manner in which he had been hood-
winked blodwen was far from being a fool
he realized also that blodwen would be
insistent in his demands for assistance in the
recovery of his necklace an assistance which
captain matsu was none too willing to give
it was the isotas first voyage and the
steamship was his first command he
desired ii possible to avoid any inconveni-
ence to his passengers that might cause
sensation or scandal

  this woman must be clever he said
thoughtfully

  she is answered blodwen his tone
leaving no doubt in his hearers mind as to
the sincerity of his belief in her cleverness

  you should have placed the necklace in
the safekeeping of the purser

  blodwens face reddened at the rebuke
in my eighteen years experience of
travel with valuable jewels i have never
lost anything but once that was when
i entrusted my property to the ships safe
the captains eyes lifted questioningly
and blodwen hastened to explain

  the ship was wrecked the passengers
escaped with what valuables they were able
to take with them but the strong-box went
to the bottom of the sea

  that experience was unusual in the
long run your jewels would have been safer
in the pursers charge than in your pockets
possibly but thats neither here nor
there the fact remains that the necklace
has been stolen and i demand your assist-
ance in its recovery

  what would you have me do

  search mrs meredith her maid her
stateroom and her effects

  the captain shook his head

  were i to do that it would necessitate
the searching of every man woman and
child on board the isota i could not sub-
ject mrs meredith to the indignity of
a search without doing the same to every
one else

  then you refuse

  i have not said so i merely tell you the
difficulty of following ypur suggestion
a better way to recover the diamonds would
be to wait until we reach port your ameri-

can customs officials duly warned of the
missing diamonds would conduct a thor-
ough search

  blodwen had thought more than once of
the customs service as a possible hindrance
to the successful landing of the stolen jewels
but he was impatient he wanted an imme-
diate search of the ship

  i have great confidence in the efficiency
of your customs officers mr blodwen
i doubt if the double thirteen can be
smuggled ashore after they have been told
of its presence on board

  but blodwen was insistent that the cap-
tain conduct a search which he more and
more firmly refused to do and since no
command is more imperialistic than that
of a japanese captain over his ship blodwen
was compelled to depart at last with his
request ungratified

  for the next few days blodwen haunted
the vicinity of mrs merediths stateroom
but she confined herself inside refusing to
be seen notes sent in by a bribed stew-
ardess were returned unopened

  on the afternoon of the third day of his
vigil blodwen was amazed to see the state-
room door open and barney coburn emerge

  what are you doing in there he de-
manded excitedly seizing the young irish-
man by the elbow

  in surprize coburn shook himself free
then as blodwen apologized for his rudeness
he smiled

  playing chess he replied

  look out for her warned blodwen
she probably has designs on your purse
shes a woman of the world and will bear
watching

  dont worry about me laughed co-
burn im sophisticated and penniless
she cant do me any harm but as far as
chess is concerned her game is improving
she studies the openings continually and
this afternoon she actually beat me playing
the white end of -an evans gambit by
the way you and i havent played lately
want to have a few games before dinner
blodwen held up his hand and shook his
head

  im off chess for life he answered

the long voyage drew toward its

 - close morning succeeded morning

  with the same red sun rising from
the same smooth sea noon followed noon
with the great glowing disk of copper

adventure

hanging motionless above the isotas black
funnels hot afternoons drifted into cool
nights with the same daily lengthening of
shadows along the deck as the sun sank
slowly to the western horizon and dis-
appeared at last into the steamers glittering
wake

  on the morning of the sixteenth day the
eastern rim of the ocean was topped by the
irregular outlines of distant mountains
and shortly before noon the isota steamed
in through the golden gate

  blodwen all impatience fumed at the
quarantine delay and paced the deck like
a caged animal as the isota slowly docked
his nervousness increased his face was
haggard as he scanned the faces on the
wharf  and he sighed with relief when after
careful scrutiny he failed to recognize any
one

  for ten minutes blodwen poured his
story into the ears of gilvrain of the cus-
toms service gilvrain who for thirty
years had worn the blue of a customs
inspector listened in silence and when
blodwen had finished stood in deep thought
before making any comment

  the situation is this mr blodwen he
said at last this mrs meredith as you
call her is an old hand at evading the
customs she has been at it so long that
she knows how nearly impossible it will be
for her to bring anything ashore without
our knowing its nature where an unsus-
pected person might land practically with-
out molestation she on the contrary will be
subjected to a most rigorous search and
this fact she knows as well as i do

  what she will unquestionably attempt
is to have the necklace brought ashore by
some confederate who will be unknown to
you and unsuspected by us i will per-
sonally supervise the inspection of the pas-
sengers and i will guarantee that the double
thirteen will never leave the isota in mrs
merediths possession or in that of her
maid but you can readily see how impossi-
ble it will be for us to thoroughly search
each individual of the steamers nine hun-
dred passengers

  blodwen nodded

  at that moment his roving glance caught
sight of barney coburn at the rail of the
ship he plucked at the inspectors sleeve
directing his attention toward the young
irishman

  it is possible that that gentleman at

the rail may be the confederate you spoke
of hesuggested

  the inspector started with surprize as he
caught sight of the man blodwen indicated

  ill give him a careful search he said

  blodwen thought there was a ghost of
a smile on the inspectors face as he turned
away to begin his duties

  three hours later gilvrain came to blod-
wen who was impatiently fuming in the
smoking-room

  no trace said the inspector laconically

  what became of mrs meredith asked
blodwen

  she left the wharf in a big limousine
as soon as we were through with her

  but she should have been arrested
exclaimed blodwen jumping up excitedly

  that would have been a mistake as
it is i am having her watched and when-
ever she is joined by her confederate they
will both be nabbed believe me mr
blodwen that is the only way to recover
your necklace

  how about coburn

  he is still aboard the ship but i will
vouch for him he had absolutely nothing
to do with the theft of the double thir-
teen

  blodwens faith in the customs service
dwindled half an hour later it disappeared
altogether when gilvrains man reported to
him that mrs meredith had made good
her escape blodwen decided that it was
high time to take a hand himself in the
recovery of his diamonds mrs meredith
must still be in the city there were meth-
ods of tracing her out he sat down at a
table burying his face in his hands to
think

  gilvrain had said that the diamonds
would probably be taken ashore by some
one of the passengers some one above sus-
picion in that case it was possible that the
necklace might still be on board the isota
customs officials never searched an out-
going vessel their activities were always
confined to new arrivals might it not be
possible that mrs meredith had hidden the
necklace somewhere in her stateroom if
such were the case how simple it would be
for her to engage the same room for the
outward passage ten days or two weeks
later and then to come aboard on the sailing
date and remove the necklace at her leisure
a search of the stateroom might prove
worth while
the double thirteen



       his train of thought was interrupt-
fyl ed by a disturbance in the smoking-
room two white-jacketed stew-
ards were in loud altercation in their incom-
prehensible jargon from words their
argument grew to blows and the larger of
the two soon drove the smaller flying up
the broad companionway to the deck the
second steward as if nothing unusual had
happened began to move quietly about
brushing ashes from the tables and other-
wise putting the room in order

  engrossed in his own troubles blodwen
had paid no attention to the quarrel of the
stewards his mind made up he sprang to
his feet determined to seek the captain of
the ship and enlist his aid in a thorough
search of mrs merediths stateroom

  as he crossed from his chair to the com-
panionway the steward paused before the
the chessboard where the pieces had been
hastily shoved into a heap at the conclusion
of last evenings play and gathered them
into their rosewood box then instead of
placing the box back on the shelf he tucked
it under his arm and followed blodwen up
the stairs

  on the deck evening shadows had begun
to stretch black arms across the promenade
against the white row of staterooms clearly
outlined by the level rays of the setting sun
the crossed lines of the steamers cordage
wove an intricate pattern like the web of
a gigantic spider

  blodwen was surprized at the hush on
deck a few hours before the bulwarks had
hedged in a crowd of eager passengers now
the rail swung in a deserted curve back past
the bulge of the cabin toward the stern of
the ship passengers had vanished but
leaning against the ladder that led upward
to the pilot-house and the hurricane deck
captain matsu was talking excitedly to
a steward

  it was quiet on the upper decks of the
isota but from the hold and from the dock
echoed the ceaseless crash of the steamers
unloading from below an endless stream
of man-propelled trucks emptied to the
wharf clattering and rumbling away into
the shadowy distances of the barn-like
dock-sheds scattered arc lamps cast a
fitful glare upon the dim figures moving
like a procession of gnomes or pixies into
the far corners of the structure among the
countless bales and boxes thus disappearing
from his view blodwen wondered if any

individual package secreted the double
thirteen

  the clank of a windlass and the sound
of a donkey engine drowned out for a mo-
ment the rumbling of trucks a huge
packing-case large enough to contain
a piano lumbered across the wide gang-
plank a stevedore on either side to steady
it and a giant longshoreman pushing the
truck on which it rode

  blodwen watching idly saw a fourth
man step out from behind its shelter as the
wheels of the truck clattered on the wharf
the flash of the mans white jacket as he
dodged for an instant into the light of an
arc lamp identified him as one of the isotas
stewards

  his evident desire to escape observation
aroused blodwens suspicions acting on
a sudden impulse he turned and hurried
down the gangplank eyes searching for
the retreating figure now vanished in the
gloom of the great shed

  for a moment he thought that the man
had given him the slip then as his eyes
accustomed themselves to the partial dark-
ness he saw a distant gleam of white and
quickened his steps at the next arc lamp
the gap between himself and the white
jacket had materially lessened he was
almost at the stewards heels when the jap
reached the outskirts of the shed and turned
abruptly to the right passing into the
street through a narrow door almost con-
cealed from view by a pile of packing-cases
blodwen following swiftly stopped him-
self by catching the door-frame as he heard
a familiar voice ask-

  have you got them

  it was still light enough in the street for
blodwen peering through the open door-
way to recognize the well-tailored figure
of mrs meredith she stood on the curb-
stone of a narrow sidewalk one foot resting
on the running-board of a big black limou-
sine whose throbbing bulk completely
filled the cramped roadway from warehouse
to warehouse she was tendering a bank-
note to the steward who in return extended
a rosewood box toward mrs meredith
blodwen sprang through the doorway and
snatched the box from the fingers of the
astonished jap

  just a minute boy he said coolly
i want to know what you have in this
box

  he snapped back the cover and to his
i

adventure

disappointment saw that it contained
nothing but a set of chessmen mrs
meredith from whose nerveless fingers the
bill had fluttered to the sidewalk recovered
her poise

  you startled me mr blodwen she
exclaimed bending quickly and retrieving
the bank-note which blodwen saw was
a twenty i was buying the isotas
chessmen i have taken quite a fancy to
them

  yes missy buy chessmen announced
the steward eagerly

  for a moment blodwen was nonplused
his brain was at work however why
should mrs meredith wish to own this
particular set of chessmen when others just
as good could be purchased for less than
half the price at a dozen stores in san
francisco

  come boy heres your money im
in a hurry

  blodwen was conscious of a troubled note
in mrs merediths voice his grasp on the
rosewood box tightened

  ive taken a sudden fancy to these
particular men myself he said turning to
the steward mrs meredith offers you
twenty dollars for the box ill give you
twenty-five

  thirty snapped mrs meredith

  blodwen was sure of his ground now he
smiled pleasantly and bid-

  thirty-five

  from his place at the wheel of the car the
chauffeur leaped suddenly to the ground
out of the corner of his eye blodwen caught
the gleam of brass knuckles as the man
sprang upon him he dodged back but
the drivers swinging fist swept away both
cap and wig at the same instant a street
lamp overhead flashed suddenly to life

  without his wig blodwen became a dif-
ferent individual

  baldy otoole gasped his assailant

  recognition was mutual

  jerry teegan exclaimed blodwen

  mrs meredith took in the changed aspect
of the situation at a glance

  heres your money she said extending
the twenty to the steward who had re-
mained standing by the door of the ware-
house an interested spectator in the whirl
of events

  now otoole she ordered holding
the door of the car wide

  jump in baldy added the chauffeur

and meet kate mcoy the slickest little
diamond smuggler in the world

  but the double thirteen protested
the bogus blodwen

  in the box with the chessmen

  thats what i thought muttered
otoole and stepped in through the door

  in the shadows he saw a second female
figure-mrs merediths maid mrs mere-
dith herself followed him into the tonneau
teegan sprang to the drivers seat

  to the imperial ordered mrs mere-
dith

  came a roar from the exhaust and the
black car leaped away toward the mouth of
the narrow street

  the japanese steward had stepped for-
ward as the chauffeur sprang to the wheel
but when mrs meredith spoke he dropped
back into the shadows now as the car
whirled around the corner he followed after
at a run thirty seconds later he was at
the public telephone in the drug-store across
the avenue his voice as he spoke over the
wire had none of the accents of a japanese
on the contrary it was sharp authoritative
and thoroughly american

  captain prentiss the voice said this
is barney coburn of the secret service
send a squad of men to the imperial at once
and arrest two men and two women who
will arrive there shortly in a black limou-
sine the men you know they are baldy
otoole and jerry teegan one of the
women is known as kate mcoy the
name of the second is immaterial shell
be with the others hold them on some
kind of a charge until you hear from me

  twenty minutes later barney coburn
without his white jacket his face red from
scrubbing away the stain that had dyed his
skin sat at one of the card-tables in the
smoking-room of the isota facing him
was his friend gilvrain of the customs
service

  it was by chance that i happened to be
in at the death explained coburn i
had been on a special mission to japan and
with my work accomplished was returning
home on the isota with no cares on my
mind the voyage was like a vacation i
played chess with the so-called blodwen
danced with mrs meredith

  then the steamer docked simul-
taneously with its arrival came the cable-
gram from the real blodwen telling how he
had been robbed and held prisoner in that
the double thirteen



hell-hole in yokohama you suggested
that i arrest otoole at once but according
to his story to you the necklace wa no
longer in his possession mrs meredith
second thief of the double thirteen be-
came according to the old saw its best
owner

  there is a certain amount of humor in
the whole story otoole masquerading
as the real blodwen with the diamonds
safe in his pocket never suspected that
mrs meredith was in the same business
as himself until he got that marconigram
from blodwens firm then it was too late
mrs meredith had the necklace

  otoole was in a difficult situation he
did a remarkably nervy thing he appealed
to captain matsu and to the customs
service forces representing law and order
to assist him in the recovery of stolen
property both failed him

  further complicating his position an
event occurred about which he knew
nothing the real blodwen escaped three
days before otoole had planned that he
should

  at this point i enter the picture with
the knowledge that the double thirteen
had passed from the hands of the bogus
blodwen into those of the masquerading
mrs meredith the rest was easy it only
remained to discover where she had hidden
it and how she planned to get it ashore

  coburn paused

  and how was it done

  mrs merediths sudden and unaccount-
able interest in the game of chess gave me
the clew if she had discarded the game
after securing the diamonds i might have
suspected that her only interest in chess
was to gain the acquaintance of otoole

but she continued to study the game until
the steamship docked consequently when
i heard your story i watched the isotas
chessmen as a jealous miser watches his
hoard when the steward came to take
them away i substituted for him and de-
livered the men to mrs meredith in per-
son

  then she has them now

  coburn grinned he stretched out a hand
to the shelf where the games were stored
and lifted a rosewood box

  the isota is especially well equipped
he said she has two sets of chessmen

  he opened the box and poured its con-
tents out on the table by this time gil-
vrain wise in the customs service knew
what was coming he smiled as coburn
began to operate on the chessmen

  with strong fingers coburn tore the
green felt covering from the bottom of the
black king and with the point of his pen-
knife picked at the circular plug that
appeared beneath it the wood came loose
in his hand and he noted that the thin
coating of lead that had been used to weight
the piece and keep it upright had been
scraped away he shook the king and
from the orifice a ball of tightly wadded
cotton slipped to the palm of his hand

  industriously he worked at the bottoms
of the other pieces while gilvrain looked on
with a broadening smile in a few minutes
coburns palm held twenty-six bits of cotton
wool he tore at the wadding with eager
fingers above his head the cabin lamps
cast their glare downward and from their
snowy shrouds a handful of small hard
substances many-faceted gleamed up at
him reflecting the light in dazzling pris-
matic colors

as needs must at various trades occupa-
tions and professions also he had studied
much and deep

  he was wise he had come to know

what protoplasmic life he knows is

formed by such vegetation

supreme on the earth living upon itself and
upon the chemicals of the earths crust
gifted with intelligence-greedy animal
life could not exist would be smothered
until plant life began to destroy itself

to fly above it to crawl beneath its surface
-thriving upon the oxygen which was an
excrement of plant life

  he has wondered whence how and why
had come the genus homo sapiens half-

life in one hand and animal life in the

an eminent theologian he was the posses-
sor of various other uncanny facts and stray
bits of learning he had gleaned from the
minds of men and from the books of
nature

  he was human enough to want his por-
tion of this worlds goods mainly because at
times he needed money to make certain
experiments buy certain books or to meet
and talk with a man he thought knew
something he wished to find out yet by a
certain twist of his nature he wanted to
make money his own way it is true he
often worked for little or nothing to outfit
for a trip or to get passage money to some
other part of the world he had been
offered good money to take some position
permanently but had smilingly refused

  work delayed him ordinary human en-
deavor was distasteful to him except as a
means to an end he was not lazy he did
labor much along his own lines he walked
thousands of miles he dug for weeks with
pick and shovel to see what was under
some crumbling ruin he hid in the jungles
for months spying out the habits of animals
birds and insects he scaled cliffs and
peered off of mountains he explored the
interior of yawning caves in the earth he
beat up tons of various sorts of rocks to see
what they were made of he analyzed saps
and gums

  no danger held him back he had been
among savage tribes and had fought them
himself fierce as a savage and more cunning
when they interfered with what he was
doing from fifteen to thirty-five he had
lived twenty years of life packed with
incident

  when he arrived at a certain andean
copper-mining camp his hair was hanging
two feet down his back chance had
brought him to the camp the chance of a
few grains of corn dropped on a llama path
many days distant from the camp the
company had bought corn from a tribe of
indians living far down the side of the east-
ern slopes of the mountains a sack had
leaked and he had followed picking up and
eating the grains over barren stretches
and through bleak mountain passes

  he was on the fag end of a long trip
he had walked the incredible distance from
rio de janeiro the entire width of the
south american continent a matter of two
thousand miles as a crow flies and for the
most part through unknown and unex-

plored territory the jaunt had taken him
eighteen months

  he had run out of ammunition and had
thrown away his carbine and revolver and
was carrying a cashibo blow-gun a roll of
tiny darts like knitting-needles an im-
mense bow and a bundle of large bone-
barbed arrows these he had taken from
an indian who had stalked him for days for
his flesh and head more cunning than the
indian he had sprung from the fork of a
tree and -had throttled the savage with his
bare hands

  his clothes were in tatters tied with
strings of beaten bark patched with bits of
skin of beast and fowl he could scarcely
speak english from not having spoken it
in so long

  he tarried not to bandy useless words
with men who stared open-mouthed as he
stumbled down the road in front of the
office buildings and storerooms he knew
the place had a company mess-house and
when he had sighted it he turned off the
main road and cut across the lot to the door
to an apron-clad american he made known
the fact that he had not had a square meal
for months

  he was given food at a little kitchen
table in the corner the animal within
him grew ravenous  he ate greedily
sucking and smacking over it in an ecstasy
of enjoyment then as his straining nerves
relaxed he went sound asleep sprawled
over his plate

  rough men came and stared curiously
at him and while he slept they bathed
shaved and doctored him with salves and
ointments then put him to bed his
subconscious self had relaxed

  this subconscious self had not slept an in-
stant in eighteen months it had re-
mained awake watchful even when his
body was deep in slumber rousing him at
the slightest sound of danger he slept for
two days and two nights without waking

  at last when he did arouse he found
new clothes on a chair beside his cot
within a few days he was at work bossing
a gang of quechua laborers at the ore
tipple he became one of the bunch a
strange bunch birds of passage t t ts
contract men

  men crowded near him in the club of
evenings when they gathered after the
days work and asked him eagerly of the
long hike he told the story simply


adventure

he had walked the estrada central from
rio de janeiro to sao jose dos campos
four hundred miles from rio and from
there-he stepped to a wall map and indi-
dicated an east and west course across
brazil and into the interior of peru

  he spoke of the jungles silent dim as
twilight at noon the swamps and deserts
the mighty rivers and rapid streams the
vast aades slashed and gashed with yawn-
ing canons buttressed with cliffs pitted
with great caverns spanning from tropic
heat to perpetual ice he spoke of the
dangers of his lone struggle the caution he
had used the grim fighting he had done with
wild men and with wild nature yet when
some one let slip a question why he had
made this trip he started to answer then
kept silent

  in a couple of months curiosity of the
crowd toward him waned for which he was
modestly thankful he became apparently
a cog of the company machine whose busi-
ness was to mine and ship out copper to the
civilized world

  yet with his renewed strength he had
begun anew to pilgrimage into unknown
fields of thought he managed to get a
small cottage on the hill above the smelter
for his own use one of the three-room cot-
tages set apart for married employees
several were vacant

  here keene did a staggering amount of
work of evenings and at night often
he worked far into the morning hours
water earth air fire ice metal insect
plant-he experimented with them tested
dissolved took them to pieces and divided
the cells to find out the laws that govern
them

  he discovered that down to an infinity of
minuteness each cell was composed of
others bound together yet possessing indi-
vidual force animal and plant cells had
an intelligence suitable to their needs living
their own fives but adding to the total life
of whatever they composed each cell had
its own supply of force revolved on its axis
went through phases and was a world unto
itself

  some of these things had been touched
upon by scientists keene went deep
deep to the bottom he connected ani-
mate with inanimate vegetal with animal
life the earth with our universe our uni-
verse with other universes

  he got hold of facts that hitherto were

unknown although men had almost grasped
them keene proved them by chemistry
with mathematics by faultless deduction
he lay hold of the exact laws that govern
all things

  he was amazed at the revelations his
work had disclosed he had found rules by
which he could understand almost anything
he attempted to fathom he stood in awe
of the magnitude of these laws their dove-
tailed perfection from an infinity of small-
ness through the gamut to an infinity of
greatness he became the greatest intel-
lect of his time he was aware of this

  keene did not feel a swelling egoism
he knew too much to give undue value to
any one person one man even though
that man be himself was too small an atom
in the scheme of things for him to thrill over

  he did feel however a responsibility
terrific in its gravity that rested upon him
he saw and saw plainly things that would
help mankind and through it animalkind
and vegetalkind he saw methods to
hasten the march of protoplasm upon the
earth to speed evolution toward the goal of
perfection to make man more of a man and
less of a beast

now he began to frequent the club
he took better care of his person
he cultivated friendships from
seclusion he came out and bubbled with
sociability

  when some one asked about a detail of
his travels he dilated upon them he spoke
of men and women and things of other
lands with sweeping strokes of clear-cut
english he painted scenes and events and
held his friends spellbound

  this all was a part of his plan he knew
the history of man he was well aware that
humankind is wary of thoughts a trifle be-
yond the narrow limits of any particular
period that it kills crucifies burns at the
stake destroys the life of men ahead of
their time in thought

  future generations judge coldly the acts
of their predecessors they build monu-
ments to men the mob has torn to pieces
and scorned but they in turn are ready
to fall upon similar men in their own midst

  robert keene did not wish to be a martyr
he wanted to live to be of use to help
lighten the burdens of humanity to strike
off a few false shackles to throw a few
beams of light along the way
the rolling stone



  it was with superhuman cunning that he
began to put the balance of his scheme into
effect he started to interject words
phrases expressions thoughts into his
talks that would bring out some natural
or biological fact some intellectual gem
some truth that would live until the end of
time he casually mentioned that certain
portions of south america were in tho
midst of remote ages of evolution he
showed that animal life and vegetal life
had taken strange turns in such places and
that present-day descendants of supposedly
extinct flora and fauna existed differing
but little from those of three million years
ago while others also existed which were
easily three million years ahead of any other
part of the world

  he mentioned plants that closed upon
small animals and insects and devoured
them of other parasitic plants that moved
of their own volition from place to place on
tree trunks of others that grew hollow pods
or knots in which to house certain venomous
or vicious insects to protect them he men-
tioned the reproduction of each kind and
the hybrids that have formed to start other
species

  he went into many descriptions about
animals birds and reptiles he had observed
giant toads whose sweat of anger is a deadly
poison other toads whose pores are used as
an incubator for their eggs lizards which half
fly and half walk over the water cannibal
fish snakes of unbelievable length myriad
forms of bird life monstrous apes and wild
men hitherto unknown tiny worms and
insects of amazing shapes and propensities
the facts were almost incredible

  however the men who had drifted to this
camp were a broad-minded lot they
themselves were rolling stones who had seen
things and had thought they connected
these descriptions with similar things they
themselves had seen

  from english-speaking countries they
had come and from all other countries
where white men hold sway the experi-
ence of any twenty of them would span the
earths crust

  there were among them an english lord
a professor who had held a chair of language
in oxford and later had been a private
tutor to a prince of the punjab in india a
german count-an imperial spy-who se-
cretly was a high official of one of the largest

steamship companies in the world a man

	v

who had been president of a bank in den-
ver a chemist who had taught his subject
twenty-nine years in one of the best colleges
in the united states a former big-league
ball-player a renowned pistol champion

  others had been experts in various lines
some were hoboes and a fewwere plain
bums some had pasts that came in
whispers from the outside some expected
futures in quick promotion to high salaries
caused by the short stay that many men
made at this high bleak wind-swept camp
all in all they were a good lot the bond
of good-fellowship was strong

  yet broad-minded as they were intel-
lectual as they were experienced as they
were they began to doubt the deductions
that keene arrived at because he went a
trifle beyond their depths he saw in their
eyes and read in their faces this vague un-
formed doubt tinged with an incompre-
hensible trace of anger for having made the
plunge this grew more pronounced as he
proceeded with his talks they listened
carefully to actual descriptions but when
he tried to make a point from such data
they walked away

  keene moved back to the bachelor quar-
ters he tried to give his knowledge to
them individually he tried by sheer force
of argument to compel an acceptance of his
facts and logic he continued to frequent
the club and to devise plans to make his
words interesting without resorting to actual
fiction or lying

  men began to look curiously at the others
and at him when he talked keene watched
these reactions carefully he could frame
words to express what he did not hear

  its too bad hes a trifle off hes been
hit by the sun the trail hammered him
too hard hes missed too many boats

  keene noted that the camp surgeon a
former panama canal man closely ob-
served his bodily reflexes and coordinations
he was being passed upon by a jury which
was half convinced of his insanity

  this cut deep these men were his own
kind of man they were rolling stones-
his class but he was the master rolling
stone the master rambler of them all

  and he was the thinker where they had
just punctured the shell of mass thought he
had plunged through and had probed the
universe he was not trying to sell them
anything he was trying to give away
knowledge he was an intellectual good


adventure

fellow striving to lend a helping hand with
what he knew

  it hurt him to see the antagonism in
minds and faces it was a hard slap in the
face he knew some men did in reaiity go
insane when the best that was in them was
unappreciated

  he worried over it trying to solve the
why of it that it did exist there was no
question so he left off trying and with-
drew into his shell he moved back to the
cottage and bachelor quarters sighed in re-
lief when he was gone

  there in the cottage he admitted that the
first round had been against him if this
broad-minded gathering of men would not
accept him what had he to hope from inex-
perienced shallow-thinking groups they
would lock him up as unsound

  he was no quitter this man he was
game to the marrow in his bones he had
won battles by fighting when he was whipped

  he began to look at his failure in an ab-
stract way as if it was something apart
from him his reasoning had been fault-
less when he tried to impart knowledge it
was no mere babbling of loose words he
had weighed each one and he had seen them
take effect a trifle later had come the
reaction against them and him

  poverty he had the solution poverty
and wisdom were not synonymous men
looked to the materially successful for words
of wisdom

  this habit had begun five hundred thou-
sand years ago around the common camp-
fire of the hairy man ape those who had
been successful or lucky in the chase with
hurled stone or club were the center of at-
traction some meat might he left over
those who had no food gathered around
those who had listening with awe-struck
faces as the wise one with sundry grunts
clicks growls and whistles entertained
them with narratives of prowess the
association of ideas had lasted down through
the ages-abundance and wisdom

  taking the angle of the others and looking
at himself keene went into the matter
coldly a tramp who had hiked into the
camp hungry almost naked men would
naturally look upon with a certain associa-
tion of ideas they would like to know how
he got food how he slept how he pre-
served his life how he lasted through it
was hard to associate the events the man
with real or superior knowledge

  then he saw himself as a foreman over a
gang of indians it was true he was paid a
hundred and seventy-five dollars a month
but this was little compared to what other
men received he had noticed that men
paid more attention to the ones who were
nearer the top of the heap and in almost
direct proportion to their earnings this
was a truth a sad sordid truth

  keene now began to spend his holidays
and sundays in strolling through the moun-
tains lunch in pocket geologist hammer
in hand he walked along studying the
earth he was not looking for biological
or geological facts he was looking for gold
ore diamonds precious stones minerals
things that men prized and paid hard cash
for

  he left off talking to men and they duly
thankful took this as a new phase of his
mental unbalance those who saw him
sneaking from the camp on a prospecting-
tour nudged each other and grinned
that sort of visionary had often been in
their midst

  one day keene was passing over a pile of
coal ashes back of the power-house that
the firemen had dumped there against the
time the section foreman would consider
the amount worth while to load on a flat-
car and use as ballast for the track or for
making walks between the buildings keene
stopped and stared fixedly at those coal
cinders for several minutes stooping he
gathered up a handful and stuffed them into
his pocket

  that night keene went to the club-house
big bert daley general manager was
shooting a game of billiards with charley
barron commissary clerk keene saw him
and edged over to daleys elbow when
bert stood chalking his cue between shots
keene touched his arm

  mr daley he said confidentially i
think those ashes over back of the power-
house are valuable

  big bert put his hand on keenes shoulder
and looked at him shrewdly

  some more of that bug stuff eh he
said with rough kindness

  then he lowered his voice

  keene why dont you take a trip down
to the coast and hang around for a couple
of weeks take a rest take a tip that
hike you made was a hard one

  this altitude is a strain on the heart and
nerves seven pounds of air to the square
the rolling stone



inch isnt the fifteen pounds at sea-level
i feel it myself at times

  then you are not interested in the
ashes keene persisted

  daleys face reddened he slammed his
cue butt against the floor

  no

  then i would like to have them if you
please

  daley started as if to swear he was a
big man with a big temper also he had a
big heart

  all right you can have them you can
have any other ashes you want they
have been a nuisance take them and get
them out of the way

  remember you gave them to me

  daley nodded and leaned over the table
to make his delayed shot when he glanced
back keene had slipped out

  that poor-is off his trolley bad i

wouldnt be surprized if we dont have to
ship him out of here soon ashes i won-
der what he imagines he can do with ashes
reconstruct some vanished planet

  he shook his head and laughed

the next day another man had
keenes gang of quechuas he had
quit as the bunch passed on the
way to work some of them came over and
watched keene pottering around the pile
of ashes he was noncommittal asking
among themselves they learned he had been
presented with the ashes it was too bad
bert daley shouldnt have tried to humor
him on tins crazy scheme it was really a
shame the man was crazy-bugs

  keene paid little attention to them he
bought numerous pots and pans at the
commissary and got to work by night he
had put a portion of the cinders through a
process similar to panning gold he had no
gold though

  men had been curious enough to see just
what he did save from the ashes and could
see nothing but a red liquid he kept pouring
from each panful to another pan in which
he saved it in three days he had washed
the whole pile and had evaporated the red
liquid into a red powder which he molded
into small tablets in all he had about a
quart bottle full

  that same night he drifted into the club
men stopped whatever they were doing
looked at him and grinned he walked
down and stood at the fireplace watching

bert daley shooting billiards bert daley
saw him there

 well hows the ashes keene he
asked winking broadly to the chemist he
was playing with the ex-college instructor

  keene took out a small pill-box in which
he had a few of the tablets and tossed one
upon the table daley picked it up and
looked at it it looked like the rough tablet
into which iodin is first concentrated

  daley smelled of it and passed it to the
chemist the chemist took his pocket
glass out and studied it gravely he never
had seen anything just like it keene
chuckled

  they both looked up at him his grin
was ah unmistakable grin of confidence
he held a pat hand this was no bluff

  what in--is that stuff asked bert

  the chemist shook his head keene en-
tered into an explanation he told how a
certain rare chemical very valuable was
found now and then in coal ashes of certain
sorts of coal in about three places in the
world and only at intervals in such veins

  the chemist bore witness to this fact

  he had heard of this chemical and knew
its name and upon having keene describe
certain properties he agreed that this was it

 the crowd had gathered around the
table when they saw something was hap-
pening they took the tablet and passed
it around and examined it few of them
remembered the exact name but they remem-
bered the value for they heard keene say in
reply to a question from daley that already
he had about twenty thousand dollars
worth and was going to take a look at thr-
ashes along the track to see if by chance
they were the right sort

  a week later he had run the amount he
possessed up to thirty-five thousand dollars
worth reckoned by the last quotation he
had seen he had been down to the moro-
bamba coal-mine forty miles away a com-
pany property and made tests that proved
the streak had played out for the time
being

  he sent the parcel of chemical by regis-
tered mail to a firm of wholesale chemists he
knew in new york and waited for a reply
while it was coming he hung around the
camp taking strolls into the mountains and
pottering around the smelter

  at the end of a month keene received a
cable telling him to call at a bank in lima
for his money the price had gone up


adventure

the cable stated that fifty thousand awaited
him he hurried down behind the messen-
ger and swung upon the platform of a coach
as the train pulled out of the station

  in an hour the camp was agog with the
news the old chemist had known from
the very night keene had shown him the
pellet that the find was a rich one a few
had taken his corroboration but the
majority had doubted and with the pass-
ing of each day this doubt had grown now
the word that keene had gone to lima to
draw so great an amount passed from
mouth to mouth throughout the camp and
down into the deep labyrinths of the mines

  what do you think about that fellow
keene what do you know about that
fifty thousand iron boys picking it out of
an ash-pile that old boy has got brains
do you mean to say you havent heard the
news

  coca-chewing quechua laborers asked the
cause of the excitement and were told
eyes rolled and heads wagged gravely
cincuenta mil pesos at dios it was too
vast for comprehension the white gringos
were a strange lot the senor keene
knew much

  as the excitement waned men remem-
bered deep in their hearts of many ways in
which they had mistreated robert keene
sturdy-bodied double-fisted hairy-chested
men blushed with memories of winks they
had passed and smart sayings they had
uttered at keenes expense the man had
done them no harm they had trans-
gressed against their code-the square-deal
code of the open road

  and brows knitted and men thought
deeply of things that keene had tried to tell
them there was not a soul who expected
him back to the camp

  but he came back the next night he
carried a bag that bulged with the weight of
money the men gathered around him as
he alighted from the train and followed him
to the club-house

  bert daley was at the billiard-table prac-
tising he strode down the room and
grasped keenes hand and blurted out his
congratulations the crowd trooped around
them and every mans face was beaming
with pleasure keene laughed uproariously
finally he began to talk

  you men have got me into a nice fix
im a student ive studied for twenty
years i study books men nature every-

thing i know many things that no other
man in the world has ever guessed but
when i try to tell you fellows about it you
fly to conclusions that im crazy you threw
me down hard

  keenes face grew wistful for a moment
and then he laughed

  and i had to outfigure you i had to go
out and pick up a fortune before you would
take any stock in me you are my class

i want you with me

  he looked around the circle of faces good-
naturedly

  can i bank on a favor from you a great
big personal favor

  yea you bet name it rang the
shouts

  keene took up the bag of money

  then take this money appoint a com-
mittee and spend it for the good of the
camp thats the favor im asking and it
is a favor i have other work in mind and
dont want to be hampered by this cash
and if i have anything to say in the future
that sounds out of the ordinary dont force
me to go out and pick up a million to prove
that im not bughouse

  the crowd roared

  keene went back to live at his cottage
the inside of the club was overhauled and
new furnishings bought an addition was
built for a reading-room and books began to
arrive by boxfuls and find places on the
rows of shelves the tables became lit-
tered with periodicals and magazines a
thousand touches were added to the camp
and the place took on an appearance of wild
beauty

  even the quechua laborers and camp
followers found themselves in possession of
clean barracks and shanties up to this
time they had lived in squalor in mud ken-
nels on the outskirts of the camp dr
ohennessy jokingly said he knew of several
who had died from the effects of taking baths

  white men who had considered the camp
no place for their families now sent for
them and they began to arrive on every
train the refining effects of women and
children began to be felt the club donned
drawing-room manners each wednesday
which was ladies day

  and in this community robert keene
was an institution his mind was con-
tinually probing for facts he labored un-
ceasingly at experiments and he took many
trips into the hills far far out on the
twice for the same offense



author of below the mark the weak spot etc-

lonely trail of unmapped thought he wan-
dered when he spoke men strained their
minds to follow each word

  the name of this strange wise man began
to travel out from the camp people
made long trips to see him colleges sent
professors to interview him on some dis-

cussed topic his name appeared often
in magazines of philosophy psychology
science and biology he knew the inmost
secrets of men and women who came to
seek advice

 the path up to his cottage bccame a
broad well-beaten road

heriff billy ransom stood
alone on the orchestra platform at
jra one enc	lng dance hall of

	the starlight saloon he was a

small man with very long mustaches that
made him look top-heavy a stranger could
not have told whether his steel-gray eyes
sparkled kindly or glittered dangerously
the skin on his face and hands warped and
gnarled like the bark of an oak tree reminded
one of very ancient parchment fifty-five
eventful years had passed over his head
leaving his scant hair the color of dirty snow

  sheriff billy blinking in the strong light
from a dozen or more oil lamps that stood
in wall-brackets let his gaze wander spec-
ulatively over the crowd that lounged on
chairs and benches and leaned indolently
against the side walls it was a crowd of
male gender exclusively the hand-printed
placard that sheriff billy had posted on the
door of the post-office that morning had
specifically stated men only

  eagle as much like any one of the myriad
cow-towns that are to be found scattered
about the broad expanse of the state of

texas as one pea is like another boasted a
permanent population of sixty males and
eight females transients kept the number
of males constantly at about eighty sheriff
billy knew all of them personally and most
of them were his friends

  there was an even dozen men however
who were not his friends nor was he their
friend thereason lay in the fact that the
dozen men represented the exact opposite
of what sheriff billy did and sheriff billy
represented law and order

  while sheriff billys eyes were wandering
over the crowd before him he was singling
out the faces of the dozen men of law-
breaking propensity and mentally checking
them to see that they were all present
much to his gratification not a single face
of the dozen he sought was missing that
was as it should be and as he had suspected
it would be for it was to the advantage of
the dozen men to keep themselves well in-
formed about the doings and sayings of
sheriff billy ransom

  a broad leather cartridge-stuffed belt
circled the sheriffs waist on either side of


adventure

the belt at the hip swung a holster con-
taining a competent six-gun sheriff billy
casually hitched the holsters around front
where the guns would be handy his gaze at
the time fastened upon the sneering face
of one frio bill king-pin of the renegade
twelve

   gents began the sheriff after clearing
his throat ive asked you-all to gather
yere tonight so as i could say a few words to
you-all about a matter of burnin import-
ance to this yere town an county we calls

theres been entirely too much lawlessness
in this neck of the woods lately to suit me
an judgin by certain remarks ive heard
some of you let fall now an then i reckon
i aint the only one feels that way about it

  he stopped and pinned frio bill with his
eyes the sneer on frio bilps face deepened
perceptibly

  durin the past couple months or so
sheriff billy went on theres been a mighty
sight of random shootin an holdin up
stages an rustlin cattle an -depredations
like them its got so a mans life an
property aint safe none a-tall round yere

of you is disposed to observe peace an
rectitude but gents i now finds theres

  he paused long enough to rest accusative
eyes upon frio bill and his henchmen

ceeded i leaves it to them thats guilty

jtthillll the second evening following at
the starlight saloon tom danton
an impetuous young man of forty-
nine years shot and instantly killed one
joe arguelles a party of mexican father
and hopi indian mother

  jack thompson one of the deputies
whom sheriff billy had sworn in to assist
him in cleansing eagle county of its human
dirt was an eye-witness to the killing he
hurried at once to the bailiwick of sheriff
billy down the street to lay the matter
twice for the same offense



before his chief before making an arrest

  now it so happened that tom dan ton
and sheriff ransom were bosom friends
their friendship had passed through almost
every conceivable sort of test and had en-
dured between very few blood brothers
existed the genuine affection that existed
between sheriff billy and tom danton

  billy tom just irrigates joe arguelles
was the way thompson broke the news to
the sheriff

  at the moment sheriff billy was sucking
at a long stogie his nimble fingers busily
weaving a hatband of horsetail hair he
spent most of his odd time plaiting buck-
skin into stake ropes and lariats for sale
and making fancy gew-gaws of hair and
beads for his friends it was an art in
which he excelled

  at thompsons announcement sheriff
billys fingers came to a full stop and he
quickly looked up at his informer with a
rather pained expression in his eyes

  hows that jack he asked

  tom just shot arguelles repeated the
other split joes heart with a bullet an
joe never knowed what hit him

  the look of pain on the sheriffs face
intensified and he laid aside his work

  tell me about it jack he requested
tom an three others was playin poker
at the starlight said thompson the
others was ed love charlie harris an
pedro zayas zayas is one of frio bills
crowd you know he was settin right
acrost from tom an arguelles was standin
behind toms chair

  pedro was winnin steady an him bein
a pore hand at poker thataway it looked
kind of funny then jim hart whispers
somethin in toms ear an tom jumps up
an lights into arguelles with his tongue
he claims joes been signalin to pedro
what kind of cards tom holds

  was that right jack the sheriff asked
jim hart swears he seen him an
arguelles dont deny it none

  what did joe do then jack

  why he come back at tom in spanish
an some of the boys what knows the lingo
says he makes remarks no real mans goin
to put up with none tom knowed the
lingo an i see his face go white then all of
a sudden he draws an puts a bullet through
arguelles heart

  did-did arguelles draw first jack
the sheriff inquired

  you mean was it self-defense billy
no cant say it was replied thompson
with evident reluctance it was just

that - hot temper of toms which it

gits away with him an i reckon he shoots
before he knowed what he was doin thats
all billy arguelles is layin on the floor
at the starlight dead as moses

  whered tom go

  he hadnt gone nowheres when i left
he didnt look to me like he was goin any-
wheres better come along an see about
it yoreself billy i dont like to say nothin
to tom him bein a particular friend of
yore n

  all right ill come jack said sheriff
billy

  as he rose to his feet it would seem that
he had aged considerably in the past five
or ten minutes his face was drawn and
troubled in silence he buckled his belt
with his guns about him and took dwn the
key of the jail hanging on a nail then
he and thompson went out and up the
street to the starlight saloon

  they found tom danton still there sitting
on the edge of a card table smking a
cigaret on the floor where it had fallen
now covered with a blanket lay the body
of joe arguelles there were perhaps
twenty men in the saloon besides danton-
including pedro zayas zayas was the
only member of the frio bill gang present

  as sheriff billy closely followed by jack
thompson entered the saloon and walked
to where the body lay and lifted a corner
of the blanket and looked at the dead mans
face not a word was spoken it was one
of those tense moments when speech seems
to be strictly out of order

  there was not a single man in the saloon
at that moment who had not been present
in the starlight dance hall two evenings
before when sheriff billy had announced
his policy of law and order for the future
and by some trick of fate some despicable
irony tom danton one of the deputies
who had been sworn in to help toward
making eagle county safe and sane had
been the first to transgress moreover and
this was the devilish irony of it tom danton
was sheriff billy ransoms best friend

  finally the sheriff dropped the blanket
and turned slowly to look at the man who
had killed arguelles danton dropped his
cigaret on the floor and rose and put a foot
on it then his eyes encountered those


adventure

of the sheriff they looked full at each
other a moment or two then sheriff billy
looked away

  did anybody yere see this arguelles go
after a gun the sheriff asked generally
of the crowd

  his tone was appealing imploring as if
in his heart was a prayer that at least one
man in the crowd would answer in the
affirmative but none of them answered
anything at all they understood what the
sheriff was driving at and some of them
cursed under their breath that they were
unable to help him

  or a knife or any weapon a-tall sup-
plemented sheriff billy

  joe arguelles he ees my frien an i
know wat he got an he has no knife or
gun an no nothin to keel danton he
keel my frien like a dog senor sheriff

  this from pedro zayas an angry mur-
mur from the crowd arose and the sheriff
looked hard at the mexican then once
more sheriff billy lifted the blanket this
time pulling it clear of the body he
stooped and searched the body thoroughly
and at length got to his feet again with
empty hands pedro zayas had spoken the
truth

  cant find no weapon gents the sher-
iff said if we could find a weapon

mebbe-

  yore barkin up the wrong tree billy
spoke tom danton im not claimin self-

defense the greaser calls me a ---

-- an i killed him

  sorry tom said the sheriff a trace of
huskiness in his voice lemme have yore
gun

  ii not long after danton stood by
himself on the dirt floor of eagles
i adobe jail looking at the moon
through iron bars the door of his prison
was locked on the outside and the sheriff
had the key and not far away in the
sheriffs bailiwick sat sheriff billy and jack
thompson

  sheriff billy his forehead wrinkled like
a sheet of corrugated iron chewed at a
stogie and stared at the floor thompson
a cigaret between his lips sat on the end
of his spine in a chair thoughtfully gazing
at the ceiling thus they had been sitting
in a complete silence for the past ten or
fifteen minutes

  if wed only found a knife or somethin

jack mebbe we could fix it so tom could
claim self-defense sheriff billys mournful
voice finally broke the silence but then
agin tom hisself admits he killed arguelles
in hot temper an didnt see joe try to draw
no weapon plenty heard him i reckon
toms guilty all right

  there was that in the sheriffs voice that
caused thompson to send him a quick
glance sheriff billys face was hard and
grim looking

  billv ransom are you calculatin
to-

  thompson did not finish what he had
started to say was even too preposterous
to think about sheriff billy made a little
noise in his throat and did not look at his
deputy

  i passed my word jack he said i
told em what they could expect if there was
any more promiscuous shootin in this yere
town they all heard me an tom hes
done gone an busted that rule plumb to

- i wisht to gawd wed of found a

knife jack

  you danged old buzzard are you aimin
to tell me yore a-goin to stretch toms
neck for killin that no-count arguelles
demanded thompson

  i passed my word an tom busted the
rule answered sheriff billy

  yore an old fool cried the deputy
why you lemme tell you billy ransom
you cant hang tom for killin arguelles
toms got friends here he has didnt
you tell me yoreself just the other day you
had an idea arguelles was one of them stuck
up the stage down to los gatos two weeks
ago if anybody round here needed killin
it was that arguelles person an now you
wantin to stretch tom dan tons neck for
riddin eagle of him billy ransom you
quit yore foolin

  i aint foolin jack said sheriff billy
shaking his head i passed my word an

i got-

  -yore word snapped thompson

  i passed my word an i got to keep it
if i was to let this go thout doin nothin
about it them varmints im after would git
the idea i was talkin through my hat the
other night an bust loose worsen ever i
got to jack there aint no way out of it
i tell you i got to hang old tom up by the
neck same as i would one of them frio
bill renegades which thems the folks im
after cold blooded killin jack it was
twice for the same offense



tom hisself says so i got to hang tom i
tell you

 jack thompson began to swear he
cursed sheriff billy up one side and down
the other he cursed the sheriff long and
fervently and he stopped only when both
his breath and vocabulary were exhausted

  i reckon mebbe im everthing you said
jack said sheriff billy humbly when his
deputy subsided but i passed my word

  thompson opened his lips as if to begin
the tirade anew but with a single sizzling
oath he closed them again and whipped out
a sack of tobacco and a book of papers and
began to twist a cigaret

  now dont you go gettin all het up
about this yere business jack thompson
the sheriff said quietly i reckon theres
others thinks as much of old tom danton
as you do me an tom was mighty nigh
born an raised together first time i ever
laid eyes on him was one time down on the 
border

  both of us was yearlins then in a way
of speakin him bein only nineteen an me
twenty-five them was troublesome days
jack they shorely was what with the
apaches an the renegade mexicans runnin
wild an lootin an killin frequent enough
to suit anybody

  the old man paused and pulled at his
long mustaches and looked at the toe of his
left boot reminiscently

  i aint much of a hand to talk about
things which happens way back yonder
so far you almost forgit they happens he
went on presently theres too much
present to keep a man busy thout diggin
round thataway in the past but this yere
affair tom ventilatin arguelles kind of
brings to mind one or two little incidents
happens quite a spell ago am i borin you
jack

  go on answered thompson gruffly

  way i come to meet tom danton jack

i hook up with the rangers an git myself
sent out to join capn saterlees troop
patrollin the presidio county border a
gang of mexicans which they got a leader
name of tino beceda was causin the
rangers out that way a heap of trouble
long about that time what with raidin
american ranches an stampedin cattle
acrost the river there was a few killins
too in cases where ranchmen objected to
havin their cows rustled thataway but
them was mostly reduced to a minimum

by the cattlemen theirselves so to speak

  well tom danton was one of saterlees
troop him joinin up not long before i came
along an somehow me an him cottoned
to each other right from the start off it
wasnt no time a-tall till the rest of the
boys got to callin us the twins which we
was that inseparable manys the time me
an toms slept under the same blanket
capn saterlee knowed how it was with me
an tom an when he sent one of us any-
wheres he always sent the other n too
which he said he was afraid wed pine away
an die if we was separated thataway

  one time when the troops restin at
marfa word comes to the capn by way of a
greaser kid that tino beceda was aimin
to visit his girl a mexican lady that lives
with her sheep-herder daddy in a little hut
down on hot springs crick near the foot-
hills of the chinati range that shorely
was good news this yere tino was a bad
egg an we had orders from headquarters
to git him first time he put his foot on our
side of the river mebbe headquarters
figgers if we ketched tino it would go a long
ways toards bustin up his gang which i
reckon it would

  as far as we knowed tino hadnt been
north of the river goin on mebbe its three
months the last time he was over on our
side he raided a ranch an killed two ranch-
men where fort davis is now he was
plenty fit for hangin so it was good news
him callin on his lady friend thataway
which mebbe we would git him that time
the kid what brought the news said he
would be alone capn asks the boy what
makes him bust out on the secret thataway
about tino an the kid says one time tino
kills his big brother an he wants to git
square with tino

  well capn sends for me an tom an
tells us were detailed to go down there to
that sheep-herders hut where tinos ex-
pected to call an fetch him in which it
was a fifty-mile ride down there from marfa

   now you two boys be mighty careful
the capn says to me an tom when we was
gittin in our saddles tinos a tricky
gent an mebbe that boy tells the truth an
mebbe he dont for all we know it might
be a trap but if we wants to ketch tino
we got to take risks i cant send nobody
else with you account of the troop goin
on special detail to alpine tomorrow im
sendin you boys cause you-all aint so well


adventure

knowed as us old heads which thats an
advantage you bring mister tino back
yere alive if you can but bring him back
so long an good luck

  me an tom starts early enough in the
mornin to come up to the chinati foot-hills
late that afternoon an we didnt have
no trouble findin hot springs crick we
struck the crick near headwater which then
all we has to do to locate that hut was follow
the crick down the hut bein in sight of the
crick accordin to the greaser kid with
plenty chaparral an pear standin ever-
where im tellin you it was a wild country

  the sun was purty near down when
finally me an tom sights the hut so we
stops an consults an concludes a plan of
action accordin to the story the boy told
capn this yere tino aint due at the hut
till mornin of the next day me an tom
figgers the best plan would be to go on to
the hut an take the girl an her daddy an
hold em prisoner till tino shows up then
we bags him so we hobbles our hosses
short an leaves em in a thick patch of
chaparral about a mile up the crick from
the hut an goes on afoot

  when we come up to the hut there aint
nobody in sight tom knocks on the door
but nobody comes to open it an we open
it ourselves an go inside if wed of had
any sense a-tall we would of knowed right
there that seein nobody an hearin nothin
thataway it was a good sign for us to lay
low but we didnt know as much then as
we do now an anyhow we was both kind
of flighty

  by that time the sun was plumb gone
an what with the chaparral thick thataway
all around the hut it was kind of dark inside
an we couldnt see nothin the first we
knowed there was anybody in the hut was
when they comes at us whoopin spanish
cuss words an poppin at us with their guns
i heard toms gun go off twicet longside
of me but before i could git my own gun
in action somethin powerful hard hits me
on the back of the head an i tumbles

  when i come to agin im all tied up
hand an foot an layin on my back about
a dozen feet from where four greasers was
set tin round a fire smokin cigarets an
jabberin spanish i judged one of them
a purty good sized gent with fancy clothes
to be tino beceda hisself which my judg-
ment was correct when i hears one of the
others call him by name

  i could jabber their lingo about as good
as they could an that way i knowed what
they was talkin about first thing i done
when i come to was look round for tom
figgerin mebbe he was a prisoner like me
or mebbe hes dead an i sees his body
somewheres but he wasnt present none
which by an by i gathers by what the
greasers say hed got clean away one of
his bullets had downed one of their men
though then he slid out the door into the
chaparral an lost hisself complete two
of em went after him but they didnt find
him an i reckoned they hadnt located our
hosses either cause they wasnt men-
tioned

  i tell you i was mighty glad to know
that tomd got away though i couldnt
figger it would help me none before he
could ride to alpine where the rest of the
troop was by that time mebbe an tell capn
what had happened an bring em on my
goose would be cooked one way or the other
there wasnt no doubt in my mind them
greasers would make me pay for the man
tom killed which me bein a ranger that-
away made it certain theyd spill my beans
there wasnt no guessin about my fate
no siree

  well when tino seen i had my eyes
open he got up an come over an kicked me
in the ribs an cussed me somethin awful
till he runs out of breath then he kicked
me agin an went back to the fire an curls
down on a blanket an dropped off to sleep
purty soon two others was asleep which
that left only one of em awake to keep
an eye on me of course when he wasnt
lookin my way i tried to git my hands
loose but i was tied too tight an numerous
for that

  finally i give up tryin to git loose an
resigned myself to bad luck which i starts
to wonderin how them mexicans will do
for me would they knife me shoot me
hang me burn me or hitch me on the end
of a rope behind a hoss an drag me to death
i concluded theyd drag me to death that
bein a favorite form of death this yere tino
party inflicts on his victims by makin
my death slow thataway hed have that
much more fun killin me

  there wasnt nothin joyful layin there
all trussed up thataway picturin myself
bouncin an bumpin along in the rear of
a hoss goin as fast as he could throw a leg
my nose diggin in the sand an my body
twice for the same offense



hittin agin rocks an gettin all cut up on
cactus no siree it wasnt pleasant by a
long shot i had one consolation though
tomd got away

  it must of been near midnight when all
of a sudden i heard a little noise like mebbe
its gravel rollin or a twig breakin about
thirty feet behind the greaser that was
guardin me he heard the noise too i
reckon cause he turned his head quick as
lightin an put his hand on his gun he
looked back that way a long time an then
since he didnt see nothin or hear the noise
agin he turned round an went to rollin
a fresh cigaret

  but i saw what he didnt an couldnt
see him settin up thataway he couldnt
see things on the ground as well as i could
you know how that is jack what i saw
an he didnt was somethin that looked a
heap like a man lavin out there belly down
in the sand as still as a shadow you bet
my heart went jumpin in my mouth if
it was a man an i was purty shore it was
a man it couldnt be nobody else but tom
danton which i thought by that time was
mebbe half way back to marfa it made me
feel lots better to know mebbe i was goin
to have a show for my life after all

  i reckon the greaser whos appointed to
watch me has a hard day of it cause by an
by he got to noddin an his cigaret dropped
out of his mouth old tom seen it too an
he started wormin his way forward a little
bit at a time i didnt hardly breathe for
fear hed git ketched before he got in
strikin reach of that mexican man but he
didnt hear tom none i didnt hear him
myself which all i could do was see him
move to know he was movin i never in
my life see a man crawl along on his belly
thataway quiet as tom did then i bet
no apache beat it purty soon he was only
three or four feet from the greaser

  then mebbe its somethin tells that
greaser man all aint well behind him an
he wakes up sudden but before he could
bat an eye tom slammed him on the head
with his gun an tumbles him over as he
went over though he let out a squawk that
brought the other three to their feet pronto
tom yells so you could of heard it a mile
then he lets go with his six-gun an brings a
man down two more shots gits another
man which its tino hisself is left an
by that time he has his rifle an bangs loose
at tom it was a clean miss him not bein

awake yet mebbe which you cant do much
with a rifle at close range nohow

  well tino saw he couldnt pump an-
other catridge into his rifle before tom got
to him so he ends her an uses it for a club
he swung at toms head like he was aimin
to knock it into the next county tom
tells me later he aggers to ketch tino alive
which is why he dont shoot no more he
drops his gun an ducks under tinos rifle
an they close the rifle goes flyin

  tino was a plumb bigger man than tom
by mebbe its fifty pounds but tom was
a mighty good hand at wrastlin an that
kind of evened things a bit they lit into
each other like a couple of bobtailed cats
with a grudge an finally went down huggin
tom on top

  me bein tied thataway i couldnt do
nothin to help tom which all i could do
was cuss that tino party an holler to tom
to look out for the knife tino had drawed
from somewheres an was tryin to stick in
toms ribs i could see everthing plain
enough by the light of the fire

  well they fought like a couple of devils
mebbe its five minutes then i hears tino
give a grunt like somethin was hurtin him
right smart an he lets go his hold on tom
an lays still when tom gits up i see he
had turned the greasers own knife agin
him which of course thats the end of
mister tino beceda

  well tom cuts me loose an we brings -
round the mexican tom knocked out an
tied him up then we look for the greasers
hosses which we found five of em in the
chaparral not far away an fetches em into
camp we lashes the four dead mexicans
on their hosses which we found the body
of the fourth man in the hut an boosts the
five man up to his saddle an ties his feet
to the stirrups then we goes up the crick
leadin the five hosses till we finds our own
which they aint been disturbed none an
starts back for marfa right then we gits
back there about noon next day

  all in all its a purty good job me an
tom done that time though tom done it
all hisself an im shore grateful to him for
pullin me out of that hole i recollect an-
other time tom done me a good turn
similar but i reckon you-all dont care to
hear about it jack ever since that time
me an toms been as dost together as the
prongs on a clothes-pin i reckon tom
dantons the best friend i got


adventure

   sheriff billy stopped speaking and
 thompson grunted an oath

   whats all that got to do with you
 stretchin toms neck for killin that
 arguellesbreed the deputy growled

   dunno jack mebbe because a time
 like this a man thinks about things
 another oath from thompson

   seems to me billy ransom he said
 if it was my life tom saved that time id
 find enough gratitude in my system to make
 me go out there an unlock that jail door an
 tell tom danton hes a free man

   now now jack protested sheriff
 billy im sheriff of this county an ive
 got my duty to do as i sees it tom
 killed an unarmed man an hes got to
 pay the penalty as specified by me the
 other night you run along jack an
 dont bother me

   sheriff billy rose and from a peg on the
 wall took down a coil of brand new two-
 inch hemp rope thompsons eyes nearly
 popped from his head

   - me if i dont believe yore a-goin

 to do it you old fool he snarled

   course im goin to do it jack an-
 swered the sheriff i passed my word an
 i got to make an example of somebody to
 show the restof you i mean business if
 toms the man i puts up as the example
 thats bad luck if i was to let tom off
 thout hangin him frio bill an his crowd
  would play their hands high an often you
 go long now like i tell you

   thompson went he went swearing and
 banged the door behind him

at precisely fifteen minutes of
 noon the following day sheriff billy
 with a coil of brand new two-inch
 hemp rope circling his left arm and his six-
 guns at his hips went to the jail and un-
 locked the door and threw it open at
 various points farther up the street eighty
 pairs of eyes were watching him

   come along tom the sheriff called
 into the jail

   danton came out and sheriff billy ges-
 tured with his free hand up the street
 danton strode away with firm steps the
 sheriff closing in behind him his right hand
 resting on the butt of a gun as they
 passed along other men fell in behind them
 at the starlight saloon about twenty men
 joined the ranks some mounted and others
 afoot it was at the saloon that frio bill

and his eleven cronies all with their horses
joined the procession

  when the crowd reached the big cotton-
wood tree that stood at the end of the street
sheriff billy halted his prisoner directly
under a big limb and ordered the crowd to
stand back the crowd formed a wide
circle about the sheriff and his prisoner

  early that morning sheriff billy had
posted a notice on the post-office door to the
effect that at high noon that day he would
hang tom danton by the neck for mur-
dering joe arguelles everybody who could
had come to see the sheriff of eagle county
send a man to eternity via the hemp-rope
route

  quietly yet with one eye always on the
crowd sheriff billy arranged one end of the
rope he carried in a running noose and
slipped the noose over his prisoners head
danton offered no objection between the
rough rope and the flesh of dantons neck
the sheriff placed a small folded saddle-
blanket explaining that he had no desire
to disfigure the persons of those who died
by his hand danton thanked him for his
thoughtfulness

  the noose at length satisfactorily ar-
ranged about the condemned mans neck
sheriff billy tossed the free end over the big
limb and brought the rope to the ground
again

  wheres my deputies he asked looking
around the circle

  yore aimin to hang one of em you
stubborn old fool snarled jack thompson

  i aint hangin em all though mebbe
it would do em good if i did retorted
sheriff billy sarcastically i wants my
deputies to step out yere an git this job
over with come on

  but not a man stirred a low murmur
like the muttering of a distant storm arose
from many throats sam boyle another
of the deputies spoke

 billy yore the sheriff all right an you
done said what you was a-goin to do if there
was any more cold-blooded killins in this
town he said but you aint a-goin to
hang tom there

  not by a-of a sight he dont hang

tom for killin that arguelles reptile
shouted frank childs another deputy all
right boys

  it would seem that there was a previously
arranged plan to take the sheriffs prisoner
from him by force should that action be
twice for the same offense



required in order to save danton childs
and several others started forward like
a flash sheriff billy jerked out both his
guns and swung them up his gray eyes
glittered

  ill mess up the first man takes another
step he said in a quiet tone but its quiet-
ness made it that more ominous you
boys back up

  those who had surged forward at childs
bidding stopped short and glowered at the
sheriff none of them doubted that he
would shoot if they went another step it
was the prisoner himself his face serious
who came to sheriff billys assistance at
that critical moment

  much oblige boys for yore good in-
tentions danton said but im askin
as a personal favor you let this hangin go
on billy dont like to do it no more n
you-all like for him to do it but you-all
aint sworn on the book an billy is there-
fore you-all aint got no call to interfere with
a gent when hes tryin to do his lawful
duty

  i killed arguelles in cold blood as they
calls it he called me that name which
that shore makes me mad an i shot him
which that makes me liable to hangin
now you gents stand back all right
billy go on with yore party i got a-honin
to see what heaven looks like

  sheriff billy gave his prisoner a glance
that was a mixture of gratefulness and sur-
prize then his eyes went roving about the
circle again until they fell upon frio bill
frio bill and all his companions were stand-
ing together on one side of the circle holding
their horses

  aint nobody yere got enough sand to
help me string up this yere prisoner asked
the sheriff

  the invitation to participate in the hang-
ing could not have been more direct had
sheriff billy mentioned frio bills name
and frio bill was secretly delighted to
receive such an invitation he hated tom
danton for two reasons first because
danton was a friend of the sheriffs and
hating the sheriff as he did frio bill natural-
ly hated any friend of the sheriffs

  second joe arguelles the deceased was
a very particular friend of frio bills he
was an important member of frio bills
gang that fact however was not generally
known though it was suspected arguelles
had been used in the capacity of scout for

the gang and his visible connection with frio
bill would have made him persona non grata
in certain quarters

  it would therefore be a decided pleasure
to frio bill to help hang one of sheriff
billys friends and at the same time the
man who had killed an important member
of the bandit gang frio bill would be
killing two birds with one stone his only
regret was that the sheriffs neck was not in
the noose with tom dan tons

  tail on here men he ordered theres
some around here aint afraid to help the
sheriff do his duty

  frio bill set the example and eleven other
pairs of hands seized the free end of the
rope sheriff billy indulged himself in a
quiet chuckle

  tom danton have you-all anything to
say before you meets yore gawd he said
to the prisoner

  nary a whisper billy answered dan-
ton with a grin play yore hand

  lift him up men cried the sheriff
pronto

  twelve pairs of boots clawed at the
ground and the rope tautened with a jerk
the next instant a dozen very much
astonished men went floundering on their
faces the rope had parted about half way
between dantons neck and the limb above
and save for a moment of pain in the neck
which the folded blanket mitigated tom
danton was uninjured

  perhaps a more astonished crowd never
got together there were one or two loud
laughs at the discomfiture of frio bill and
his men

  reckon youll have to git another rope
billy said danton rubbing his neck im
kind of hefty you know les have another
rope somebody

  frio bill came stumbling up cursing
softly to himself and digging sand from his
ear as he passed his horse he caught up
the coil of rope swinging at his saddle-horn
and proffered it to the sheriff sheriff billy
ignored the proffered rope completely

  gents i shorely hates to disappoint you-
all he said to the crowd there aint
goin to be no hangin today less you
fetches me another prisoner suitable for
hangin providence has done took a hand
in this game an tom is saved by the skin
of his neck

 sheriff billy was looking squarely at frio
bill as he spoke frio bill cursed roundly


adventure

  sheriff aint you goin to hang danton
he burst out

  shorely not answered the sheriff if
you knowed the law like i do youd know
you cant put a mans life in jeopardy
twicet for the same offense providence
done busted that rope an that settles it
i aint the man to buck providence no
siree

  danton hisself says he killed joe cold-
blooded snarled frio bill its right he
gits his neck stretched

  i reckon youve had yore say now bill
said sheriff billy calmly next time some-
body comes up for hangin mebbe pro-
vidence wont be lookin an the rope wont
bust thataway i hopes you sabe mister

  frio bill understood the sheriffs meaning
perfectly and at once shut up and dropped
back among his companions

  is that right billy dont i git hung
today asked danton

  i cites you-all the law tom an i
observes it to the last letter replied the
sheriff

  danton let out a whoop and loosed the
rope and blanket about his neck and threw
them on the ground

  boys whos my company down to the
starlight to drink on my good luck he
shouted come on billy

  sheriff billy gathered up the two pieces
of the hemp rope and tucked them under
his arm then let danton lock an arm in his
and pull him toward the saloon

  frio bill knew well enough that he and
his gang had not been included in dantons
invitation to drink so scowling darkly at
the crowd as it moved away he and his
men remained behind

  maybee we get heem another time
capitan said the soft voice of pedro zayas
in frio bills ear

  frio bill whirled on the mexican

  were goin to git the-away from

here thats what were goin to git he
said the man thatd try to hang his best
friend wouldnt stand back if it come to
stringin up his worst enemy i allow this
aint no healthy place for this gang no more
so we rides git aboard men

  sheriff billy heard the thudding of horses
hoofs behind him and turned his head he
saw twelve horsemen riding swiftly west-
ward he was rather inclined to think that
he was taking his last look at frio bill and
his gang and he chuckled to himself he

turned to danton who walked by his side

  tom wasnt you scared a little bit
he asked

  scared answered danton scornfully
say you old reprobate i reckon ive
knowed you long enough to know when
yore bluffin scared nothin i knowed
youd find a way out without havin to go
back on yore word an spoil yore bluff to
frio bill an his crowd besides billy
i reckon the rest of the boys overlooks the
fact that even if you are sheriff you cant
string a man up without hes been found
guilty by a jury

  an theres another thing you old
renegade danton went on you shore
was a-beatin the devil round the stump
when you-all says you cant risk my life

guelles thataway tom ill write the govner

remember that big hombre with saterlees
troop when we was that fella you pulled
out of the rio grande that day when he
had cramps

  shore i remember him

  hes govner of texas now tom its
all right you ventilatin arguelles

  late that night when sheriff billy had
gone to his bailiwick alone after a prolonged
debauch at the starlight saloon with tom
danton and other friends he unfastened a
coil of brand-new two-inch hemp rope con-
sisting of two pieces he looked at the ends
where it had parted that afternoon

  the core of the rope had been severed
with a knife and the outside strands had
been neatly woven together again with a
skill that deceived the most critical eye
it was an excellent example of blind splicing
the rope though brand-new would scarcely
have sustained a fifty-pound weight

  sheriff billys face broke into a smile
author of french ilcels and bobbed hair

dmiration for bravery is uni-
vm versal there are countries where
as vg-i honesty is held low countries
where the cultivation of loyalty
is neglected countries where unselfishness
is despised as weakness but black white
red brown and yellow men unite in the
worship of courage

  we were talking in this vein skipper
dredge amory and i one lazy after-
noon on the bridge of amorys little tramp
steamer the sham-pan which lay at a
wharf in marseilles

  dredge loved to philosophize to go to
the bottom of a subject andmuck around
for all lumps of fact as he put it which
was how he got his nickname

  speaking of courage look aj them
chinks coming aboard now said amory
waving a hand toward a stream of chinese
coolies which poured off the dock over a
gangway and down into the odoriferous
hold of the old steamer with most white
men chinamens courage is proverbial for
no courage at all yet ive seen things
in the east thatd make me think twice
before id say that the chinamans yeller
goes any deeper than his skin

  the skipper paused and narrowed his
eyes as he always did when thinking

  i believe courage is mostly a question
of what a man thinks is worth fightin
for he continued a flag aint nothin
to a chink but just you try to take a
foot of his land from him or maybe sug-
gest disturbin the bones of his ancestors

  a reflective sparkle in amorys eye grew
quickly to a blaze of amusement

  i seed a feller oncet- he was fairly
crackling with internal laughter now-
i seed a feller oncet try to put a street
car line through a chinese cemetery roary
boary alice

  in his gusty laughter the captain choked
on his quid his tanned face turned purple
the approach of the third officer with a
question about stowing the cargo put an
end to our conversation

  i did not dream how soon we were to
have a demonstration of the quality of
chinese courage as i leaned over the
bridge rail and watched the coolies coming
aboard they were some of the invalids
weeded out of the labor corps which were
used to make roads and dig reserve trenches
in france when a chinaman in a foreign
country becomes sick in body he becomes
homesick in soul a homesick chinaman
is no use to any one including himself
therefore these were being sent home on
the sham-pan

 home that word has a meaning to a
chinaman which few of us nomadic ameri-
cans ever know for instance here was i
with an army discharge in my pocket
bound for shanghai instead of for new
york but to a chinaman his home is
half his religion the skippers words re-
turned to me

  i believe courage is mostly a question
of what a man thinks is worth fightin for
a flag aint nothin to a chink

adventure

  certainly no nation has less patriotism
than the chinese i reflected but no
nation has more love of family and is
not the chinese attitude an intelligent one

  i looked aft to number two hatch where
a crane was dropping chunky oblong boxes
into the hold there was an example of
chinese values each of those boxes held
a body doubled up in the buddhist fash-
ion-the body of a labor coolie who had
met death in france and who had put it in
his contract that if he died his body must
be shipped home for to be buried in
a foreign land is to the chinese mind a
tragedy too painful to contemplate

  the old sham-pan would ride high on
this voyage except for the coolies living
and dead she would carry little a cargo
of corpses yet it was a fitting cargo for
this old hulk a mere rotting corpse of a
ship herself how old she was how many
years she had sailed the four seas of china
alone no one seemed to know

  on the front of the deckhouse was an
empty niche where had once been her
builders name-plate owned now by ameri-
can and chinese capital she flew the chi-
nese flag her skipper was an american
her second officer a portuguese her third
a briton and her crew chinese

  when the oriental republic had entered
the war thesteamer had been in the china
coastwise trade since then she had made
one voyage to france laden with food-
stuffs and the effort had laid her up three
months for repairs her plates were rusty
her tackle was frayed and her salt-caked
smokestack canted aft and to port con-
sidering her chinese name as two english
words the sham-pan was well named

  a dirty dock in summer is not a savory
place and all of us were glad when the
wheezy old ocean wanderer joined a con-
voy of freighters bound for suez

 i at sea again to leave behind
the foul smells of the city the rattle
of cabs the shock of cobblestones
for the soft green restfulness of the sea
when at the harbors mouth the sham-
pan met the ingliding embrace of the ocean
she gave herself to it gladly utterly as to
the caresses of a lover long away

  twenty-four hours out of port our engine
began to weaken the senior convoying
destroyers repeated inquiries as to whether
we needed help were stopped at last with

  the message that little could be done for us
in the opinion of our chief engineer who
had diagnosed our engine trouble as senile
decay whereupon the destroyer set
standard speed for the flotilla at a pace that
made us seem to crawl and morning found
us alone

   behind for miles our low-trailing smoke
brushed the foamy wake undisturbed by a
breath of air the day was frightfully
hot the slight ground-swell which crept
through the expanse of viscid blue jelly
about us gave it no more life than the
painted canvas ocean of the witching
waves at coney island the sun climbed
higher our decks sweated pitch

  on such still hot days as this one and
those that followed the best hour is just
after sunset as the sky darkens the air
grows slightly cooler and men who have
dozed all day begin to walk about the ship
a little it grows yet darker and a big
star shines out above the foremast the
officer of the deck lights a cigaret con-
tentedly for now he has a tall ship and a
star to steer her by

  an even fringe of white foam clings to
the ship from end to end and hisses softly
steadily sleepily it is a cool sound too
for it suggests the faint rustle of slush ice
on a spring morning when the tide begins
to move a straight furrow runs diagon-
ally off each bow deepened by the shadow
from the faint moon except for that
soft steady sleepy hiss overside there is
no sound unless you go aft to the uneven
roar of the wake

  down beneath number two hatch candles
always glimmered and incense burned be-
fore the coffins a boy of nineteen called
teddy because of a fancied resemblance to
a famous american statesman and an
elderly chinese named sing wo were the
chief mourners it seemed that one of the
queer-shaped coffins contained the body of
a brother of sing wo and another held all
that was left of the father of teddy and
each time i went near this sepulchral part
of the ship i found the devoted man and
boy in attitudes of immovable grief

  it was good to leave this gloom for the
noonday blaze of the bridge from here
an officer and a seaman swept the horizon
with glasses the same alert watch was
kept by a sailor in each of the two crows-
nests a lone steamer armed with only
a three-inch gun and limping along at five
celestial cargo



  knots an hour would make easy picking for
a u-boat

  through borrowed glasses i swept the
horizon myself until my eyes began to
wince at the monotony of blue sea broken
only by blue sky i was about to lower
the glasses when miles away something
thin and sharp jutted from the polished
surface of the mediterranean then the
water boiled and a great gray shape rose
dripping from the sea and bulged against
the horizon until the lenses were filled with
the familiar profile of a large submarine

  orders were shouted this way and that
and miraculously the old sham-pan hummed
with sudden life coolies ran to our side
and stared stupidly at the distant steel
monster then jabbered excited gutturals
to other coolies below eager hands tore
the canvas jacket off the gun at our stern
black smoke poured from the steamers
stack she had been making her best
speed under the conditions yet almost
imperceptibly she began to make better
she lurched about on short zigzags creak-
ing and groaning

  we pointed our gun but the range was
too great to fire almost immediately a
column of water shot up off our bow but
two hundred yards short

  another geyser leaped up three hundred
yards the other side of us he had the
range of us the enemys gun carried far-
ther than ours he could keep out of our
reach and pepper us until he got a hit home

  there was nothing to do but to heave to
and surrender probably dredge amory
was about to do this when a fluke shot
struck fairly on our bridge knocking the
skipper senseless killing the second officer
and two seamen and carrying two spokes
out of our wheel

  i was stunned myself bruised and cut
by the time i recovered my wits benson
the third officer had reached the damaged
bridge from his post at the gun and was
shouting orders like a mad man our
engine stopped obediently and the five-
colored flag of china fluttered down the
jackstaff

  at this a babel of voices rose from the
stern our coolie passengers began gath-
ering there in an excited mass their tones
quickly changed from fear to unmistakable
anger fists were raised at the scorching
sky

  two men who had no business on our

   

  bridge appeared there sing wo and teddy
the two chinese i had seen mourning their
dead in the hold behind them on the 
companionway were the faces of three or 
four of their fellows serious faces with glis- 
tening eyes the mien of sing wo and
teddy was serious too almost menacing
as they approached the third officer

  master said wrinkled sing wo we
wanchee speak you

  whats the matter asked benson

  of course he should have booted them off
the bridge with celerity but he was a man
of slight morale at best and he was not at
his best now under the sudden burden of
responsibility

  you no makee fight master asked
sing wo no makee more fight sub-
maline you dlop china flag hey you
makee one sullenda

  -you yes were surrendering yelled

benson gradually regaining something like
the proper air for an officer were sur-
rendering to keep you all from being blown

to pieces like them two seamen was -

-you yes were surrendering and you

two--monkeys get to-off this

bridge

  sing wo did not move benson raised
his arm to strike a chinese quartermas-
ter seized the upraised wrist

  no mus slike him master said the
quartermaster apologetically as benson
turned on him with a snarl he velly
good man number one holy man

  benson wrenched himself free and made
to beat down the quartermaster when the
old chinese whom till now i had supposed
to be a common coolie stepped between the
two

  master i speak you ploppa said he
master you listen me two hunda china
boy here they all follow sing wo

  indeed there was an air about sing wo
which implied he had long been accus-
tomed to speak with authority

  master he continued suppose we no
fight how fashion submaline do this ship
submaline makee sink evellything

  no snapped benson you and your
precious two hundred can have a chance
to save your lives in the lifeboats you no
drown old chink

  but sham-pan go sink persisted sing
wo evellything inside bottomside sham-
pan go sink all dead china boy mus
go sink


adventure

  -- - yes yelled benson and

if you and your - pals dont climb off

this bridge and obey my orders you can tell
them all therell be two hundred more china
boys thatll go sink get i say-get

  sing wo got but without dropping a
particle of his dignity

  we looked at the submarine again she
was signaling

  abandon ship immediately have your com-
mander board us with ships papers let all your
other boats stand by half-way between your ship
and us

  a canny boche that he was still far
enough away to be a very difficult mark
for us to hit even if we had had the whole
concealed armament of a mystery ship

  benson gave an order for lowering and
manning the lifeboats and went to get some
papers from the captains cabin where
amory had been carried and lay still uncon-
scious i went to my cabin which adjoined
bensons in the bridge-house and began
throwing things into a canvas carry-all

presently i heard benson enter
his own room and begin to rum-
mage about there then from his
direction came a choking sound like an out-
cry stifled at birth

  i turned toward my door and plumped
into the arms of two sinewy chinese sea-
men in my weakened condition i could
offer very little resistance and in a few
seconds was trussed against my berth an
undershirt stuffed into my mouth for gag
i heard bensons door slam then my door
was closed also and locked from the out-
side

  feet pattered about the deck beneath
my porthole for a few seconds then abso-
lute silence fell over the sham-pan

  what treachery was this i judged the
only other able white men on the ship
benson the chief and the second engineer
had met the same fate as i or a worse fate
if only that submarine would hasten and
board us austrians would be welcome now

  if i must be a captive i thought i
would rather be an honorable prisoner of
war than a victim of god-only-knows-what
undcthand plot

  the key clicked in my door sing wo
and teddy entered they bowed with
polite gravity

  master said the number one holy
man now the evident leader of all his

countrymen aboard the sham-pan mas-
ter i think you good flen all china people
we no wanchee hurt you master but
you sawee we no wanchee submaline makee
sink all dead china boy a pleading note
crept into sing wos voice as he continued

  master you been china side you sav-
vee ploppa ligion china people say all
china people when die mus be belly
buried china side ploppa china glave
if submaline makee sink sham-pan thlee
hunda china boy soul no havvee peace
you sawee

  i savveed i had heard of the doc-
trine of feng-shui or incomprehensible
wind-water which dictates that every
chinese after death must be given a prop-
erly placed grave in his own country

  well to put sing wos story into plain
english he declared that he and his coun-
trymen had decided that the sham-pan
would never go to the bottom with that
celestial cargo except after a fight which
made a corpse of every buddhist aboard
her

  i gathered that they felt that the salva-
tion of their own souls was at stake that
they would be doomed to writhe in some
chinese hell under the eternal curses of
their children and childrens children unless
they resisted to the last breath any viola-
tion of chinese theories for the proper
burial of those corpses in the sham-pans
cargo

  yes sing wo was aware that our three-
inch gun was practically useless against the
heavier ordnance of the u-boat he was
aware that the submarine showed no inten-
tion of coming near enough to permit us to
board her but he had determined on a
tlick to make this tlick effective
my help was needed

  we let you loose you help us master

  after very little consideration i prom-
ised that i would loyally help this mutiny
for the purpose of continuing the resistance
against the sworn enemies of my country
this mutiny of chinese against the order of
her british commander that the ship be
surrendered

  sing wo led me below decks and aft
always keeping me out of range of observa-
tion from the u-boat in the semi-
obscurity between decks teddy and the
chinese quartermaster who had intervened
between benson and sing wo brought
from a locker a quantity of dynamite and
celestial cargo



explosive caps these extraordinary orien-
tals explained that they wanted to make a
bomb-

  velly big number one bomb master
plenty big makee sink submaline

  they did not know how to make it
could i show them i could and i did

  apparently only sing wo teddy the
quartermaster and four seamen were in
the conspiracy the quartermaster directed
two life-boats already loaded to row off
toward the submarine which had become
suspicious of the delay and was signaling
furious threats to resume firing then he
proceeded lowering filling and dispatching
the other boats with the exception of the
dingey which he held ready at a rope lad-
der on the side of the steamer away from
the u-boat

  meanwhile i was showing sing wo and
teddy how to make a tremendous bomb
by stuffing a quantity of dynamite into a
galvanized-iron ash-can after fitting on
a detonating device we wrapped the can in
a tarpaulin leaving exposed only the firing-
pin straps and a handle were then  taken
from a suitcase and fitted to the bomb
giving it the appearance of a crude duffel-
bag just such a piece of baggage as a sea-
man might carry

  sing wo and teddy saluted each other
gravely almost tenderly followed by
two seamen who carried the bomb sing
wo went above hiding a hammer in his
clothes as he went

  teddy told me to stay where i was while
he looked forward to make sure that amory
benson and the two engineers were still
prisoners teddy and six seamen were to
stay aboard the sham-pan to guard us
five occidentals the bulk of the chinese
were already bobbing up and down in
badly overcrowded life-boats at distances
of a few hundred yards from the old steamer

  the captains dingey put off from the
ship and was rowed rapidly toward the
submarine by the four seamen who were in
the conspiracy the bomb lay beneath a
thwart within easy reach of old sing wo
in the stem sheets

  teddy brought sea-glasses for himself
and me and through a half-shrouded port-
hole we watched the progress of sing wos
desperate plan to save our gruesome cargo
from desecration

  the submarine began to run in rapidly
its gun trained on the dingey when a

cable length from the tiny craft it hove to

  we saw a man in the conning-tower raise
a megaphone to his lips no doubt he
was asking why there were no white men
in the dingey sing wo stood up dignified
even through the glasses and shouted be-
tween his hands

  velly solly master white mans all dead
me havvee ship paper i could imagine
him calling

  there was a consultation on the conning-
tower then the dingey was ordered to
come alongside

  -i that picture is unforgetable the
 blue swelling- mediterranean the
gray life-boats gently rising and
falling filled with huddled coolies the great
grim submarine glistening in the warm sun
and that frail cockle-shell carrying five chi-
nese on their errand of preposterous brav-
ery i had little hope of their success i
knew that even if they could get alongside
without arousing suspicion the efficacy of
the crudely made bomb was very doubtful

  i wanted to take my eyes from the
glasses but i could not the lenses were
wonderfully strong even the clear-cut fea-
tures of the u-boats commander were dis-
tinguishable he was debonaiply blond
and lean he seemed so young such a
handsome boy that i felt a momentary
glow of pity for him an insane desire to warn
him this vanished when his face wrinkled
with rage as he shouted an impatient order
at sing wo there was no telling when
an allied warship might happen along and
the austrian wanted to be done with this
job quickly

  the bow oarsmen in the dingey shipped
their oars one of them threw a line deftly
across the submarine an austrian sea-
man caught it and strong hands hauled the
little boat alongside

  sing wo had remained standing since he
had answered the u-boats first hail one
hand lay on the steering-oar the other
hand was hidden in his clothes we knew
it clutched the hammer we had seen him
pocket now whipping this out he bent
forward and struck

  nothing happened hurriedly he raised
his arm again the austrian commander
pointed at the old man and an austrian
seaman leaped on sing wo just as his arm
went down the second time

  there was a glare as if some one had


adventure

suddenly opened the door of a gigantic
furnace then a rush of air and thunderous
sound that capsized two life-boats and shook
even the distant sham-pan like the first
burst of a typhoon where submarine and
dingey had been the water was leaping and
lashing skyward

  the only traces left of these two craft
were a few splintered fragments which
plopped into the sea about us a few seconds
after sing wo blew himself into buddhahood

        the lifeboats still afloat saved a
few of the unfortunate coolies from
the capsized boats and returned to
the ship while teddy and i liberated ben-
son and the two engineers amory was
still unconscious and remained delirious for
days

  with benson in command again we got
under way teddy and the quartermaster
were never punished for their part in the
insubordination benson although weak
was not a bad sport his report of the
strangest mutiny perhaps ever chronicled
was fairly written and all sorts of posthu-
mous honors were bestowed on the four
seamen and sing wo by the allied govern-
ments

  to the chinese of course the very word
posthumous is absurd as the sham-pan
poked her way to shanghai over waters ever
blue and ever smooth the conduct of our
coolie passengers and crew showed that to
them sing wo and the four seamen were
now more alive than ever candles burned
for them it is true and prayers were said

for them in the gloom below decks around
the corpses their bravery had saved for
proper burial but the way the living
referred to them proved how real to these
coolies was what we westerners speak of
glibly as the immortality of the soul
throughout the rest of that weird voyage
we learned how actual to a chinese is the
oneness of past present and future the
unity of the dead the living and the unborn

  the self-immolation of sing wo and the
four seamen was not a sacrifice of the living
for the dead as it seemed to us occidentals
it was a sacrifice of men living in one state
for men living in another a sacrifice which
those orientals believed had saved the souls
of our coffined fellow voyagers from insult
and degradation unthinkable and it was
a martyrdom which had sent sing wo and
the four sailors-despite the dissolution of
their own bodies-on to a plane much
higher than the condition they had known
in this world

  this belief in the continuity of exis-
tence-so instinctive in buddhists that it
is part of the very breath of the east-
far surpasses in intensity similar convic-
tions held by any but the most fanatical
christians it could never be quite com-
prehended by lifelong materialists like ben-
son and me

  but the other lesson of sing wos heroism
was as clear as the tropical seas which bore
us on to shanghai as dredge amory had
said-

  courage is mostly a question of what a
man thinks is worth fighting for

unseeingly

on the huge sergeants face shook merrily

  the httle mans eyes through the thick
unaccustomed glasses came round to spring
and gazed up at his new questioner dazedly
the eyes came back and at long distance
peered vaguely at the thumping palm

  the whisky came and one hand with as-
sistance poured then lifted up the glass
the other hand stayed just exactly where
it was and kept on beating time

the little londoner and drew him aside
with intense seriousness he placed his lips
close to the little mans ear he whispered
be a pal cockney dont keep things

quickly and cleverly and why

  the little mans weak eyes thoughtfully
searched the floor minutely they ap-
peared to scan the bar and ceiling dream-
ily they came round to spring a hand
went up-the hand which didnt tattoo-
and the thick glasses came away

 them glawses them blawsted
glawses the little man said quietly

  and hopelessness-a depth unplumbed
in hopelessness-was in every letter of each
soulful quivering word

  the thick owl glasses went safely on
again and without any fraction of trouble
whatever the laughing spring faced the lit-
tle man back round to the counter

straight down admiringly the bearded

open palm slowly he brought it closer
until it almost touched his nose with the
thoroughness of a scientist trying to split

but i cawnt get used to the messin things

in sides

  the bearded sergeant laughed and laugh-
ing patted the small man on the back

  thats nothing cockney youll soon
get over that he said happily and made to
take the little fellows pattering hand

  aough dont touch that blawsted and
and alf jumped madly back its bit

  bit and at once big spring was deathly
serious what bit it

  what bit it a voerschlack a bloomin
whip lash

  a wha-a-at

  a whip lash denys the transport
rider awsked me while i was fiddlin rahnd
if id clean up a voerschlack for is mules i
worked free or four ours on the bleedin
thing piece of raw ide it was

  oh and so you cut yourself big spring
said pacifyingly

  nah im bit bit be a whip

  the sweltering crowd stood round and
calmly waited waited for cockney to curl
right up and die

  and carefully with eyes an inch away
from sweating skin he went once more over
the flattened palm

  its that there bleedin musters the
little man explained ever since capn
musters said i was no more use in the plice
an put me on to boss the boys in the gard-
ing- me lookin awfter bloomin sweet
peas an roses an honions an dysies

  the little fellows voice trailed off into
sheer dumb disgust and there it stayed
stayed while the palm had just one more
inspection

  and all the crowd kept silent for speech
was too hard work

  that bleedin musters the small man
went on presently that bleedin mus-
ters said i was too blind to ride a orse
a-gyne an got me these ere blawsted
glawses

  once more there was deep silence and
cockneys eyes were running weakly they
passed across the open palm and searched
and searched in vain a hot tear dropped
an i got bit the little man said sadly
kindly but firmly spring gripped the
trembling hand smiling he looked it
quickly over

  bit if that hand got bit cockney
that hand got bit by rattiness theres not
a mark on it can you feel anything
with painful seriousness the bleary eyes
looked up with pained voice the little
man went on

  rattiness be anged im bit bit be a
whip for a second the small man hesi-
tated at least twas a whip when i put
it dahn he finished lamely

  and then the company roared roared
with no trace of sympathy

  you put down a whip and picked up a
slamashla mani



snake spring howled and the thing
never bit you at all

 the outstretched hand came lamely
down and the spectacledface went sheepish

  well i wasnt goin to tyke no bleedin
chawnces i didnt know if snyke bite urt

oles dyou blyme me

thumped a back heavily not a bit and
where was this snake when it bit you

dead somewhere the bloomin boy be-
hind me killed the bleeder only a little
squirt of a thing it was bout free feet
long

  oh just a baby spring said disinter-
estedly

  but while speaking an eye winked wick-
edly one man sidled up

  go see if you can find that dead snake
spring whispered must have been a
whipsnake crawling on the fence and cock-
ney mistook it for his lash lets pull the
little fellows leg

  the sweating dripping crowd lined up
and spring bought two full rounds lazily
his eyes surveyed the crowd then satis-
fied the big man bought again

  with glass held high appraisingly spring
looked toward the ceiling

  heres a go cockney taint often i
drink with the dead

   appy dyes

  that was a narrow squeak slamashla
mani youll have to practise with those
glasses before you take any more risks

again god never meant a policeman to
five by picking weeds

  nor snykes neether

 no cockney if i were you and i
thought they wouldnt trust me on a horse

and go back to london

  the little mans hand swiftly came down
with a bump his glass hit the counter the
ruddy face went gray the mouth sagged
limply

  blymey no no bloomin london
the little fellow gasped im syfe aht ere
an syfe im goin to keep

  safe and the big spring rippled gaily
safe alf and you play tag with snakes
snykes well snykes only bites you
once an snykes cawnt talk all dye any-
wye thoughtfully the little fellow
stopped and pondered an night he
added seriously

  the missing man quietly returned slow-
ly he edged his way through the crowd and
up to the bar and tightly pressed against
the cockney

   bout my turn isnt it he called to
spring across the little man whats
everybody going to have

  as though surprized spring turned his
head then wedged the cockney on the
other side and all the crowd pushed in
while something slipped gently into cock-
neys pocket

  whisky spring answered wearily i
dont know anything else

  professionally the men poured and mea-
sured with the eye then all stood off

  heres to our next and the glasses
went on high

  heres looking at you

 heres-

  but springs full glass came down untasted
why cockney you little fool youre
crazy you never put that whip lash on

round the bleary eyes looked watery fury

fully a finger pointed and pointing al-
most touched a breeches pocket the other
hand with ponderous meaning tapped a
forehead

  mad cockney absolutely mad the
voerschlacks in your pocket this very min-
ute and hanging out

  blearily dreamily completely mystified
the little fellows hand felt down and
shakily it gripped the hanging lash and drew

it out shiveringly tremblingly the hand
and lash came up and close before the heavy
glasses

  ugh wah and the thing hit the wall
sharply twenty feet away its that there
bleedin snyke a-gyne

  the little mans hand reluctantly loos-
ened its hold on the door-post and he
stepped out into the open the sun on the
parched plain beat back like a huge flat
yellow flame and the bleary eyes saw fire
and nothing but fire

  for a moment the small man stood and
teetered thoughtfully then at a venture
aimed for the garden aimed blindly

  ha-ha-ha lo mlungu maninge dar-
gale came loudly from somewhere twenty
yards ahead

  the voice was a welcome guide post and
the small man knew it but his face had to
pucker in fury

 who the - s drunk you mind
your own blurry business

  the laugh came back again and the
cockney steered for it

  biff and he charged full into the rail-
ings and clung on

  cant you see where youre going you
drunken fool a voice a dozen feet off
roared

 with studious care the little man straight-
 ened up

 shernly i cn shee he announced with
 perfect gravity bloomin rylin got in
 wye thass all

the owner of the voice came up and
lightly gripped a shoulder

 drunk again eh cockney youre get-
 ting to be useless

 roughly the little man shook himself and
 freed his shoulder

not drunk a-gyne who the-you

talkin to s them blawsted glawsses
for a second he paused then shook a dig-
nified head  s shame drunk anywye
he admonished

 more firmly the helping hand gripped him
 again and aimed him for the gateway

come on cockney dyou expect me
to get all the fence taken down just sos to
make a big enough gateway for you to wab-
ble through without killing yourself

 a hand went out and firmly clung to each
 side the opening shakily the little man
 braced himself

 you go wye he said yarningly you
 takin vantage just cause youre offisher
 think you cn talk me like that

 with little effort captain musters undid
 the little man and shoved him on
slamashla mani



  come along cockney come and lie
down

  shan come long goin wash blullfool
water panshiesh an liliesh wanna wash
im waer liliesh

  grimly the captain grinned to himself
and pushed his captive on

  be sensible slamashla mani dont
be a fool

  in a second the faltering feet went still
the body stiffened the wabbling march
stopped chock

  dont you call me slamashla mani
capn musherst don you call me four
eyes  and the weak eyes tried to blaze
the six-foot captain laughed an all-
embracing laugh

  dont be silly you know we mean
nothing when we call you four eyes
dontthey call me gerties papa
yesh but youre offisher cn call you
anythin

  the bunch of living fury commenced to
wilt and captain musters again took up the
white mans burden

  easy now just a few more steps
then ill put you on your stretcher and
make you comfy

  for a dozen yards or so the weakening
feet staggered on then the going became
slower and slower the feet mixed and
still worse mixed dizzily the httle fellow
struggled to halt and get them sorted out

  that malaria certainly didnt do a thing
to your sight slamashla mani youre as
blind as a bat

  once more a violent wrench a furious
struggle once more the weak eyes shot a
watery blaze

 t - wif that slamashla mani

t-- wif-

  the captain dodged aside the vicious
blow passed by him and just as he should
hit the ground the captain caught the flying
man and saved him easily he swung him
over his shoulden kicking hitting and
swearing the httle cockney was borne help-
lessly home

  and like a naughty fractious kid he lay and
cussed himself to soddened dreamless sleep

the horses were fitfully picking
their way through the high grass
the dry stalks cut them the thorny
bush ripped them the holes and rocks deep
covered were hidden and an everlasting
pitfall

  all day long-for three solid days long-
the body of horses and men had pushed for-
ward and for two nights in the still afri-
can moonlight the men ever on the alert
had rested and swapped whispered lies

  half a mile ahead on the brow of a rise
two horsemen halted and looked leisurely
over the country rolling far ahead for a
moment the main body of police halted and
waited the two men turned and one man
waved a hand then at an amble a broken
tripple the horses moved ahead once more

  over there behind those hills spring
said as the troop reached the top of the hill

  over there the little man riding be-
side him assented thoughtfully abaht
firty mile or more to go yet

  about that and only think in behind
those hills theyve killed every single soul
every white farmer every miner and
prospector every man and woman the
big man hesitated and child he added
viciously

  yes my- tortured an murdered

em-the poor elpless bleeders

 tortured the-

  the riding men ahead drew farther away
the flankers spread more widely slowly
the tiny crowd of police descended the slope
and struck into the level plain the bush
higher than their heads closed round them
as though a sea each man saw just his
neighbor and nothing more

  firty mile the little cockney muttered
again firty mile there aint no bloom-
in dynger yet

  you know as well as i do cockney
theres danger every second some peer-
ing eyes have seen us from the top of the
last hill of that you can be sure

  but they cawnt see from them ills
them ills is all aze

  hazy now cockney but on a clear day
i wouldnt like to bet their eyes cant reach
this far

  the little cockney smiled wryly them
kaffirs dont get no malaria then

  no alf and to make sure as you
know theyll have outposts out every mile
or so in each dangerous direction and
insimbell know all about us and how many
we are long before daybreak to-morrow
the blighter eh well he aint got no
more to murder anywye excep us
twisting and dodging from bush to bush
and round bush after bush the httle mob
went on at times a snake stopped in its


adventure

wriggling march in startled curiosity then
shot away like a flash of living ribbon in-
sects buzzed and screeched and shot jets
of filth at the intruders and always and
everlastingly gaudy-hued lizards raced out
of sight in all directions but of human life
or of signs of human life not one faint trace

  mye as well be in yde park the little
cockney suggested but for the bleedin
bush	

  then his horse rose a good four feet on
high and the mamba it had trotted over
squirmed frantically away

  the blazing sun like a huge red ball
tipped the edge of the far horizon as
though pushed down it slid away and the
long shadows became faint dusk the sud-
den african night closed in

  well camp here captain musters di-
rected as they came to an open space be-
fore a line of greener fresher looking trees
we can at least see a few yards round us
and theres a sluit ahead there should be
waterholes somewhere in it

  there used to be spring told him
but the seasons been so dry

  the weary sweating horses halted and the
men off-saddled and rubbed them down
a couple of men detached themselves and
made to hunt up water a few were busy col-
lecting wood for fires

  carefully spring went over a penciled
list and ticked off eight or ten names on it

  youre a lucky little beggar after all
cockney he said laughing those glasses
are quite an asset i cant put you on sen-
try or outpost duty with those on

  the little man looked hurt

  sen try duty he blurted out disgustedly
men dont want eyes at night in this ere
bleedin bush they want ears

  youre right cockney ears and eyes
and noses

   the little fellow sniffed

  gwan i dont want no bloomin kaf-
firs near enough for me to smell em

  the frogs in the sluit piped shrilly piped
their shrill call mixed in with throaty croaks
water water in a dozen places from
somewhere in the bush a jackal yapped a
querulous womans yap and from a point
a mile or more away a wandering jackal
howled an answer back then as the moon
sailed up the breeze went cold and all the
eery sounds of the gentle african night rose
on the clear thin air

  by the side of a blazing fire springs quat-

ted and watched the water boil for tea

  the freest life on gods free earth
cockney he said ruminatively yet for
all we know death may be looking at us not
even a hundred yards away

the little cockney smiled and the aching
eyes seemed to be piercing a vast distance

  free spring yes this is freedom
its ard to think that were not syfe aint
it

  hard enough cockney with this still
night around us but less than fifteen miles
away inside those hills we saw theres hell
them blawsted kaffirs

  yes cockney but when you come to
think way back from their point of view
were really in the wrong you can scarcely
blame them

  blyme em if the bleedersd only kill
us decent but this ere torture an wo-
men an kids too its bad this time
you bet its bad alf thats why
musters brought out every man he could
lay hands on thats why he brought you
out along

  for a second the little fellow gulped then
smiled wryly

  oh i cn shoot awright a fellow dont
look out the sides or over is bloomin
glawses when e looks at a sight

  not if he ever wants to see his home
again

  the little cockney winced then smiled
smiled a queer smile and stupid

  thats if he murmured strangely

  the blazing fire died down and spring
threw on more sticks fresh flames sprang
gaily up from a slight rise a good five
miles away the rumbling roar of a lion
echoed and rolled through the trembling
earth the shuddering roar went out and
in the deep silence the almost silent wings
of a passing bat seemed noisily disturbing

  what ever made a little man like you
cockney come away out here and join this
mob of toughs spring asked presently
his bright eyes smiled true friendship the
big beard shaking with a happy laugh

  i wanted to be syfe

  creditors police joined the police
to escape the police

  police naw nor creditors neether
whos goin to give a bloke like me credit
enough to run awye from

  what was it then cockney this
isnt the kind of life a man like you hankers
after
slamashla mani



 it is though its the only hfe worf
 livin

 yes but what put it into your head in
 the first place

 the little man was silent in the uneven
 firelight what might have been an unasked
 blush spread over his thoughtful face

 what was it

 but still the man was silent

 what was it cockney girl big
 spring insisted

 the blushing face went really red

 girl no ooman

 woman some skirt you got tied up in
 id never have thought it of you cockney
 thought what

 that youd be messing about with other
 fellows wives

 the little man looked daggers unspeak-
 able disgust

 stash it you bloomin ijjut there was
 no other fellow

 no other fellow cockney and spring
 laughed loudly and you let a girl throw
 you over and took it so to heart you sent
 yourself to exile

 with scathing pity the httle fellows eyes
 searched into the others

 frow me over no bleedin fear no
 ooman ever got a chawnce to frow me
 over

 what you married her cockney
 naw and the profound disgust was
 absolutely superbly perfect the bleeder
 married me

 the cold clear moon rose higher and by
 its light spring stared incredulously upon
 his neighbor

 married you cockney he said with
 earnest sympathy poor little devil
 yuss married me

 and what were you doing all the time
 that she was getting married

 i wasnt doin nothin the httle fellow
 pleaded

 thats why

 why what

 thats why she married you

 the httle fellows eyes came round in

 sorrowful rebuke what in - could i

 do she weighed fir teen stone six

 the waving beard of spring stood straight
 out in the air his face aimed at the stars
 the piping frogs were speechless as his great
 laugh rolled by

 whats hurting you came over from
 the next fire

 hurting theres nothing hurting me
 musters its cockney whos hurt the
 httle shrimp just said hed let thirteen stone
 six marry him

 thirteen stone six a hundred and

 eighty-eight pounds -

 yuss the httle man agreed emphati-
 cally

 well it was your own fault spring
 ventured you must have given her en-
 couragement

 i didnt

 but you must have cockney you
 must or else she wouldnt have insisted on
 marrying you

 i tell you i didnt the little man de-
 clared unalterably and savagely then for
 a moment he was silent she was a
 widow he added presently and his
 speech was very very weak

 and once again spring laughed

 poor beggar and so you thought it
 better to come out here and chance fight-
 ing kaffirs than to stay at home and argue
 with her

 it was syfer the httle man observed
 but what was the trouble alf the
 main bone of contention

 trouble the fambly

 what too much mother-in-law
 mother-in-law me foot no the fam-
 bly the ready-myde fambly er byby
 oh i see she had a child when she
 married you how old was it

  bout free years

 and how old was it when you left for
 africa

  bout free years an a week

 a howl came from musters and all close
 round joined in kaffirs and danger might
 have been a mihion miles away

 quite a quick actor the captain said
 admiringly marry in haste and repent
 much hastier how did the final bust-up
 come about

 that bloomin byby

 you didnt like the kid what was it
 boy or girl

 a httle girl an she was always idin
 things an that ooman blymed me

 poor cockney

 yuss he said miserably an then
 one dye she said id drank er fours-abaht
 her wha-a-at

 her stout big spring explained

  er fours-abaht the doctor told er
 she was weak er weak an then the


adventure

bloomin rotter said she must drink staht
at every bleedin meal mind you

  well that was all right cockney mus-
ters soothed a big woman like that-
thirteen stone sis-needed something to
keep up her strength

  the little mans disgust was freezingly
sublime

  i didnt mind the staht he muttered
bitterly but the bloomin ooman twitted
me with pinchin it on er

  and i suppose you did spring laughed
staht would i drink fours-abaht i
dont drink no oomans stuff

  id hate to trust you with a bottle now
cockney

  shut up the little mans voice threat-
ened that dye she said id pinched er
lawst four bottles i told er id never even
say fours-abaht a-gyne in all my life
fours-abaht

  and so you came out here

  yuss i ad to go somewhere for peace
the small mans voice died off into a whis-
per-to a mere movement of the lips

  an syfety they seemed to finish up
for one more careful day the little band
moved on the bushy plain lay far behind
and all around were hills hills growing
rougher and higher as they drew deeper into
them hills with great bare overhanging
rocks great holes and caves and rifts

  hill after hill was surrounded and rushed
yet only to find the kraal on top of each
completely deserted not a living native
or sign of a living native in sight but of
relics of recent feats and relics of things
more awful there were signs a-plenty
gruesome parts of many a gruesome body

  once more the sun went down and a mile
away from the foot of the last kopje theyd
raided they made camp for the night

  no harm in making fires captain
musters said theyll never attack till
dawn if ever they attack at all and my
opinion is theyll simply keep moving out
of the way and doing all the damage they
possibly can

  that sick kaffir we picked up this after-
noon seemed to think so spring remarked
said there wasnt a single kaffir left in all
the hills at first but after a bit of prompt-
ing explained that insimbes men were
massed at mashabis forty miles away
for a while captain musters was
thoughtful

  mashabis theres not enough of us

to rout him out of there if he is he pres-
ently observed but if that kaffir we
found says hes there you can depend in-
simbes quite somewhere else

  thats my opinion spring agreed
and our finding that sick man was no
great accident either

  where is he spring i said to bring
him along

  hes skipped waited until we got
alongside that last rocky hill then bounded
away like a buck

  then well need extra guards tonight
tomorrow morning

  tomorrow morning spring decided
but though every horse was saddled an
hour before dawn and every man stood
ready sunrise saw the country as free of
kaffirs and as innocent of any enemy as
ever drill ground on a sunday morning

  too innocent the captain murmured
dubiously

  a much too obvious quiet spring sur-
mised

  and each man shook his head

  the afternoon was wearing on the roast-
ing sun deep in the west for hours the
men had ridden through a winding heav-
ily bushed plain more than a mile wide on
each side of which were towering kopjes
more than once men had climbed those
hills to scan the country beyond the val-
ley narrowed the scouts a good half-mile
ahead moved up a rise and passed into a
beetling gorge

  that kaffir was right musters spring
mentioned wearily theres not a black
skin left in all this district

  seems like it spring theyve done
their work and cleared

  just bit and ran

  the men in the gorge reached the nar-
rowest highest point quietly they reined
in and appeared to be making a careful sur-
vey of the land on in front then one man
looked behind where they had passed

  zipp and he fired his rifle excitedly
back and at the side of the lazily moving
police then his arms worked furiously

  from each side the little band of men
came scattering shots then twisting and
dodging the men of the flanking parties
rushed back into the main body

  and with them in came hell

  from every covering bush from every
shading rock in every clump of grass rose
painted shrieking kaffirs hundreds of
slamashla mani



them thousands each man with flow-
ing head-dress each man with ox-hide
shield each man with bloody murder in his
heart a few had old trade rifles the rest
sharp assagais and native battle axes

  with howls and shrieks and piercing
yells the painted men rushed in a shower
of assagais came through the air ahead of
them and some hit wincing flesh others
fell shivering deep into the burning sand

  instinctively the police separated and
fired at any moving thing and for a mo-
ment the onrushing kaffirs took cover as
best they could then screaming on again

  make for the kopje on the right get
on higher ground captain musters
shouted above the noise and backing
and charging the little crowd made for the
rise

  a horse or two went down and their riders
backed on foot once or twice a hiss or
curse went up as an assagai found its mark
and was wrenched away and more than
once a man went down and didnt rise again

  the howling mass of kaffirs still kept
close around on every side and still the rain
of assagais was falling gingerly the horses
picked their way through dead or wounded
natives and several times those wounded
men gashed savagely at moving legs as they
passed over them

  right in the gizzard the httle cockney
said grimly as a kaffir fell and he rammed

his breech block back again - all

the wye for tuppence and then another
kaffir kicked and sprawled

  you seem to like it cockney but its
no joke spring muttered as he hastily
filled his magazine you wait till they
get right in

  we mustnt let em spring now watch
this bleeder

  a savage head peered round a bush and
cockneys bullet caught it squarely the
kaffir didnt even scream

  free shies a penny the little fellow
piped and once again he fired

  the backing pushing horses were near-
ing the foot of the hill and still the kaf-
firs dodged from bush to bush and kept
around them

  the troubles coming now cockney
spring cautioned well have to cross the
open to get high enough to see them
theyll ave to cross the open too

  i know dont let them get you cock-
ney-alive

  i aint a-goin to

  be careful

  the cockneys horse jumped high and
screamed quickly the cockney turned his
head an assagai was firmly in the horses
buttocks and trailing out behind

  the cockney wrenched and threw it far
away

  into the small open space the police were
crossing the kaffirs madly rushed yelling
and howling with stabbing assagais poised
they bounded in the police drew their re-
volvers the last backing man turned to-
gether they charged blindly up the rock-
strewn hill -

  and from above a new-a thicker-rain
of assagais fell on them

  a screaming kaffir charged the httle
londoner and hissed the stab passed
harmlessly against his saddle and the httle
mans revolver barked a hiss the other
side of him and the revolver barked again
then a shield hit up against him flat

  the shield stayed wedged the face be-
hind it glowering instantly the httle man
rose in his stirrups and crashed his clenched
revolver butt down on the kaffirs head
the kaffir howled and jumped away ziss
and the assagai stabbed savagely

  the frantic horse squealed loudly and
swerved on two hind legs squealing it
spun completely round on every side the
cockney were vicious sweating faces and
cursing howling mouths were everywhere

  the little fellows revolver went empty
and at once he clubbed his rifle a dozen
men stabbed at him but his squealing horse
spun round again then helplessly the lit-
tle fellow loosed the reins to use both hands

  a kaffir seized the reins then promptly
fell with brains all spattered and another
man grabbed at them

  the rifle butt fell and missed the
kaffir at the horses head seized it and
jerked it furiously away and then-just
then-the cockney wondered

  furiously the kaffir brought the rifle up
and swung the frightened horse squealed
madly and sprang into the air and as it
did a floundering hoof ripped tremblingly
out-and into the kaffirs chest ripped
and tore down completely through his
stomach

  with agonized screams the horse kept
twisting round and wildly hopelessly the
httle cockney gripped the saddle before
him then of a sudden in crazy maddened
i

adventure

agony the horse charged blindly through
the ring of kaffirs an assagai deep in
streaming and flapping as it ran

  the horse charged through the kaffirs
and at the kaffirs a dozen hands reached
for the reins but the terrified beast dodged
by them

  grimly the little fellow sat as assagais
hissed past him grimly he clutched the
saddle and numbly held tight on his face
was cold his teeth were clenched his brain
quite dead

  a crowd from out the howling mob
turned with him and leaping raced along
chance assagais still fell and more than
once one grazed against the horse

  but panting charging blindly through
bush and over bristling rocks the frantic
beast rushed on gradually the chasing
men seemed fewer seemed to get further
away the sounds of firing soon were get-
ting far behind

  slowly the little cockneys mind began to
work again his brain faintly to act me-
chanically the little fellows hands felt for
the reins and found them cut

  the shivering bleeding horse went on
galloped yet slower and much more shakily

  the horse left the bush and charged into
long grass charged for a hundred yards
through grass above its back

  both fore feet plunged deep down into a
hidden ant bear hole the horses brisket
touched the ground

  once more the horse screamed loudly

  and cockney turned a somersault and
promptly went to sleep

  the little mans eyes opened and he weak-
ly moved a hand and felt himself the open
eyes saw nothing and he closed them tight
again

  once more the eyes went open and in
painful puzzlement he rubbed them
rubbed them and still he couldnt see at
all

  wearily the little fellow stroked his open
shirt damp all over dumbly it flashed
into his muddled brain that it was night
and for a while he lay just as he was

  a hard half-whining breath sounded a
few feet away wonderingly the little man
came to himself again and listened the
troubled breathing kept on and he turned
himself over and got on hands and knees

  with nervous care he crawled the few
long feet to where the breathing seemed to
be a hand touched something-touched

sweating skin-and then his throbbing
brain woke up

  poor blighter he muttered sorrow-
fully poor bloomin pal

  stiffly he leveled himself to his feet then
felt along the shivering quivering horse
still in the buttocks stuck a five-foot stab-
bing assagai with teeth set at the thought
of it the little fellow ripped the assagai
away the weakened horse making but a
single fretful whimper

  then once again the small man felt along
the quivering skin whizz and with all
his force he drove the blade in where he
best guessed the heart would be

  poor blighter he murmured once
again you poor old beast

  the little man turned round and walked
to where hed lain unthinkingly he went
on hands and knees and felt ground me-
chanically he felt the sand then grass and
thorns and bush his shaking hands
touched fretfully at everything in reach
and still he wasnt satisfied

  again he felt around felt carefully pains-
takingly and far and once or twice the
small things which he touched moved
off

  the little man sat down and for a mo-
ment thought dazedly he reached to a
pocket and produced a box of matches
with deep meditation he counted to see
how many matches he could spare then
as the breeze for a short moment died he
struck the matches one by one and hunted
slowly round

  carefully he examined the spot where he
had fallen carefully he inspected the
ground beside the horse every rock and
foot of sand and towering clump of grass
and all he saw was rock and sand and grass
and that but hazily and dimly

  but half a dozen matches still remained
dumbly the little fellow pondered with
a sickly feeling he closed the box and pushed
it back into a pocket

  roughly he kicked and hit a patch of
grass down flat then wearily he lay and
straightened himself out weakly ex-
haustedly hopelessly he slept and waited
for the dawn

  without his glasses

  the sun was high and blazing when the
little man came to himself each bone
seemed cracking each muscle stiff and dry
fretfully he reached beside him and felt
his water-bottle the bottle was half full
slamashla mani



and warm greedily he drank the best part
of it then struggled to his feet

  unthinkingly he shook himself the
bruises from his fall had hardened and his
body seemed like one big sore dully he
felt himself and rubbed himself then looked
toward the horse

  the horse was one great blurr

  for one full minute he stood with eyes
firmly closed the eyes went open and
still there was a blurr

  the little fellow took a couple of shaky
hesitating steps the outlines of the big
blurr moved puzzled he stood and closed
his eyes once more then opened them and
took another step

  the blurr moved moved distinctly
and he heard it

  the watery eyes strained painfully and
he walked on the blurr moved in a dozen
places moved noisily

  anxiously the little fellow halted dead
halted and listened then turned and
staggered horrified away

  and as he staggered more blurrs came
down from out the sky and joined the flock
of gorging vultures on the fresh-killed horse

  the cockney swallowed hard

  the shadows were solid beneath each
bush the sun directly overhead wearily
the little fellow sank beneath a tree and
pulled the stopper from his water-bottle
greedily he drank the last remaining
steaming drop

  and for a while he rested

  an hour later appraisingly yet dreamily
he inspected himself and counted up his
goods one clasp knife and still six matches
with a wry smile he opened up the tin
opener and corkscrew in the knife then
closed them and hung the knife away back
on his belt

  and once again he wandered out

  the grass was high above his head and
slowly he pushed through it at first the
stalks had cut him but hed long since found
a stick to use to push a way and for an
hour or more without the faintest thought
of aim he beat his path along

  the grass grew shorter then died away
completely happily he stepped out into
clearer sand sand with scattered tufts of
bush the weak eyes roved around but
past the nearest clumps of bush saw noth-
ing but gray smoke

  thoughtfully the little fellow stood and
gaged the sun overhead smiling he turned

aside and picked his way in the direction in
which he thought his troop had come

  and still he staggered on

  the blinding sun poured on him and in
the fierce hardness of his blind march the
sweat dripped down in little rivulets soon
his mouth caked with parching thirst his
lips went cracked and then he stood in
dumb dismay

  back in his saddle bags were rations
and he had never thought of them

  the little fellow laughed laughed loud
thought of them with that vast horde
of vultures there and he unarmed and
almost blind

  laughing a silly cackle he started on
again took up the march to nowhere

  the hills closed in and for a while he
skirted them fear that if he climbed up
he might fall back kept him on level ground
dully he kept along the foot of the hills the
while the sun went lower

  and then he knew that he was circling
round

  uncaringly he turned aside and took a
line away and steering by the sun he held
a wabbly course

  the shadows were growing longer but
one hour more of light the little fellows
throat was aching his tongue like prickly
sand but one more day like this and he
must die

  the sparse scrub turned to bush the
bush to grass the dry grass became green
hopefully the little man pushed on and
dryly licked his lips

  the grass seemed damp then came a line
of trees trees like a line of shimmering
ghosts which reached up to the sky the
cockneys nose worked fast the cock-
neys weak eyes gleamed smiling he
pushed his way along and through the danc-
ing trees

  beyond a sandy beach the far side that
clear water water that gleamed and glis-
tened like mirrors in the setting sun

  laughing the little man skipped down
and tripped across the sand two yards
ahead was water still clear sweet smell-
ing water

  a log lay on the waters edge the little
fellow lifted up a foot to step across it
lifted a foot found the log too high and
stepped upon it

  gratingly the log moved and commenced
to turn

 the stepping foot came back and
io

adventure

shivered shivered and splashed into the
yielding sand

  the moving log came round twisted into
a half circle

  squealing the little cockney jumped
away sobbing he wildly charged toward
the high green grass

  and whimpering blubbering like a httle
child he tore his maddened course along

  a mile away beneath a tree the little
fellow lay and shivered the red sun
touched the hill tops poised for a second
then softly slid away ten minutes more
and the bright night had fallen

  with pounding heart the little man rose
to his feet and stared with blinking eyes into
the tree above him shakily he felt the size
of the trunk and roughness then reached
above and groped around for limbs

  the waving hands gripped at a stunted
broken branch and jerkily he raised himself
then carefully felt above and all about
the limbs were fairly thick and mostly
strong enough and once more the cockney
rose another foot or so

  again the hands went up and tightly
gripped a bough something at rest upon
the bough-something cold and soft-
wriggled beneath his hand and curled
around his wrist

  frantically the hand came loose and furi-
ously the little fellow flicked it the
wriggling thing flew hurtling through the
air and cockneys other hand slipped free

  struggling he wilted backward and
grabbing wildly at things he couldnt see
he fell bumpily from bough to bough

  gasping he lay still in the grass below

  and once again he sobbed

  the soft cold dew fell on him and soon he
felt refreshed and with the coolness came
new hope

  half undecided a hand went to a pocket
and the box with the six lone matches came
slowly out blearily the little man held the
box close and peered at it then sadly he
shook his head

  fire meant safety from prowling things
yet two-legged death might see

  sorrowfully the matches went back and
the little man lay down once more and for
a while he dozed dozed fitfully

  crack and he jumped up wide awake
again and a frenzied animal rushed off into
the distance and as he stood there wonder-
ing the chasing hon passed not a dozen feet
away

  the small mans blood froze still and his
knees knocked together his head felt
queer and he sagged down again

  and all that frightful night wedged
tightly up against the tree the little man
sat firm and listened listened with weak
eyes staring and staring eyes quite useless

  not twenty feet away a prowling hyena
halted and quietly looked him over and
cockney never knew yet when a long full
mile away the same hyena turned and
laughed the small mans tired spine went
trembling

  swift jackals raced close to him and
scuttered off in terrified surprize yet in
the shadows the dull eyes never saw them
nor did they see the slinking leopard whose
green eyes hungrily pierced through and
through him

  or the wild cat which crouched upon
a branch above

  yet every breaking twig or snapping
blade of grass cracked like a rifle to him
and buzzing insects sounded like whirl-
winds in the still night

 and as the morning sun streaked up
above the horizon a small weak hopeless
man sat with arms gripped round hunched
up legs

  and silently he sobbed

  with cracking legs the little man stood
up and stared straight at the sun pain-
fully he sucked his tongue and tried to wet
his lips then lifted high his arms-and
winced

  the useless eyes stared round and round
then once more at the sun again the small
man strove to lick his lips

  the drawn face smiled a smile of hope-
less doom one at a time the small man
moved his legs and tried them out then
slowly stepped away

  the sizzling sun went higher and still
the little fellow staggered on through
bush through scrub through grass the
grass went high went low went thin went
out sand and for most a mile clear sand

  the way began to rise and rocks were
looming large clumsily the little man went
over them or limply passed aside the
rocks became bigger higher whiter rocks
of a beetling hill

  the little man kept on and soon the
rocks were split numbly his weak brain
showed him this was a well worn path yet
numbly his brain refused to tell him more
and teetering staggering wabbling like a
slamashla mani



drunken man he wandered up and up

  the path began to twist then-zigzagged
right and left on without a thought the
little fellow went

  the rocks had disappeared-but a dozen
feet away-and the week eyes searched
round blankly for them the eyes saw
nothing and the path went widening on

  on the thin air a faint sound trickled
down the little man stood still and
scarcely breathing listened the sound
came down again a deep full rumbling
voice

  smiling the man went on the aching brain
seemed useless and up and up he
went

  again the voice came down and once
again he stopped the words were indis-
tinct but they were human

  perhaps the police

  the tottering feet moved faster at-
tempted a piteous rim the rocks fell right
away a great flat open plain

  two fluttering forms rushed to him two
wiggling charging forms

  the small mans face lit up a deep
thank god burst out

  the hazy forms came one each side him
each roughly gripped an arm quickly
the little fellows nose twitched sharply
twitched a suspicious sniff

  the eyes bulged out the jaw sagged
down the opening mouth was yammering
then the lips closed and opened

 c

  the shouting glorying kaffirs rushed
him with them as though he were a toy
the tired legs stumbled and still they rushed
him on roughly they lifted him then let
him slip and drag

  voices from everywhere came echoing
voices of men and women shrill squeals of
childish joy from everywhere poured
forms dark sinewy lithe forms dark
cruel savage forms and forests of waving
head-dress swaying and fluttering as they
moved

  the stinking crowd closed in around and
yelled and danced with glee danced and ges-
ticulated leaped and mouthed and shrieked
shrieked filthy taunts and screamed a wild
revenge

  grimly the little fellow set his teeth
grimly his dull brain told him to try to
hold his peace

the glorying kaffirs pushed ahead the
crowd in front danced back dancing they

led the way toward the center of the open

square

  and there for one long moment the whole
crowd stood and yelled

  a tall gaunt hideous man rushed from
a thatch-roofed hut the howling crowd
in sudden fear divided and the tall man
jumped along the pathway they had made
a dozen crouching leaps he made then
landed dead before the trembling little man
firmly his captors held the little fellow and
faced him to the hideous man the man
grimaced stood close and with long
pointed claws made a pretended vicious
slash right at the small mans eyes

  the cockney simply saw a blurr and
innocently he smiled

  the gaunt man jumped away and howled
in mad surprize again he sprang almost
upon the little man and slashed within a
foot of his pale cheeks

  the small man saw a shadowy blurr
and once again he smiled

  the tall gaunt hideous man backed off
in sheer unfeigned dismay backed off
a score of feet and stood in puzzled thought
howling he made a maddened rush jumped
high came down within six inches of the
little man

  the cockney wondered why the sudden
shadow and smiled

  the gaunt man turned away cunning
witch-doctor of a cruel tribe-for once the
man felt beaten that a policeman right
away out there alone was blind could never
enter his savage head and theyd pounced
upon him far too quickly for him to
realize the white man couldnt find his
way

  puzzled the witch-doctor walked slowly
into his hut and slowly came back out
again the happy grinning natives still
held their helpless prize

  thoughtfully the gaunt man wandered
down the open lane of men a grass woven
covered basket swinging from one hand
meditatively he placed the basket on the
ground and looked up curiously at the
little man the gaunt mans eyes were
troubled

  with anxious care the gaunt man moved
away a flap of covering skin from off the
basket swiftly he slid his hand inside and
made a dextrous grip the hand came out
trailing a long brown mamba the snake
wriggling to fix itself around the arm

  the gaunt man rose and stood a short
adventure

yard from the quaking white man grin-
ning a hideous yet mystified and wondering
grin he watched him for a moment silently
then lifted up the mamba and held its
open willing mouth three inches from the
small mans nose

  the small man saw a feeble shimmering
blurr and smiled

  the gaunt man dropped the reptile back
and saw it safely in then straightened
up and made a slow queer sign quickly
the happy grinning kaffirs loosed their
furious hold and took the cockney lightly
by the rolled up sleeve the happy grins
turned instantly to scowls of bitter dis-
appointment

  and in deep disgusted awe they moved
their prisoner gently off

  the huge insimbe stepped toweringly
out into the open and casually watched the
silent procession coming toward him with
fierce resentful eyes he glowered at the
white man and waited for him to come closer
up lazily his vengeful brain questioned
the awesome silence

  the guiding men convoyed the little man
up to the big chief then quickly stepped
aside the following crowd halted a score
of yards away and waited curiously ner-
vously the gaunt man stepped before his
chief and made a ponderous bow then
stood and looked him queerlv in the eyes

  tagatil witchcraft he said and
lightly tapped his forehead

  the big chief scowled and took a long
stride forward

  ikona tagati-the white man is
shamming

  glowering insimbe stooped and brought
his face until it almost touched the cock-
neys his mouth opened wide and he
made as though to bite

  the small man noticed a cloud before
the sun and smiled

  insimbe straightened up and motioned
to the gaunt man by him

  hes shamming the chief insisted
or else the man is mad

  the gaunt man turned and pointed
pointed to something foul which lay upon
the sand outside the kraal sharply the
gaunt man beckoned and the same two
kaffirs again caught hold of their prisoner

  more gently they aimed him and steered
him as they went went to the grisly
awful thing outside

  the torn wrists were still tied to pegs

deep in the ground the feet still tied and
wide spread-eagled out the dead lips
hacked away showed firm set teeth the
nose and ears were gone and where the
eyes had been were ghastly sockets

  the chest was ripped the body scarred
and on the stomach a charred spot where
a small slow fire had burned

  the cockneys keen nose twitched
twitched like an anxious cat carrion the
keen nose said carrion two full days old

  the silent crowd drew up around the
cruel remains the small man and his holders
close at the very feet

  the gaunt man grasped a shoulder and
a neck grasped it and forced the small
man firmly down the small mans face
came not two feet above the rotting thing
came and the gaunt man moved the cock-
neys face around so that it couldnt miss
a part of all the fearful crime

  the weak eyes saw a huge flat blur the
keen nose smelled a stench the cockney
wondered why and smiled

  in superstitious fear the big chief moved
away in unfeigned terror the gaunt man
moved along the watching crowd with
wondering mouths sagged open backed a
safe distance and stared with frightened
eyes

  witchcraft it is the huge insimbe
murmured harshly

  witchcraft the gaunt man muttered as
an echo

  witchcraft the little cockney thought
as the oft-repeated word- suddenly sank in

  and once again he smiled

  the little cockney loudly called for
food a score of anxious kaffirs hastened
to fetch what he required the little fellow
sharply demanded water and water came
at half a dozen hands

  smiling the small man called that a man
should be put to attend him to guide him
in a kraal he didnt know

  a trembling kaffir at once was singled
out and shiveringly took up his job as most
unwilling servant

  fearfully the big chief backed into his
own great hut and crouched down on the
floor the gaunt witch-doctor entered
scaredly and crouched before him and for
a while witch-doctor and coward chief
consulted

  a mad man and a white man that
was unnatural some magic somewhere
beyond their savage understanding white
slamashla mani

man or black no sane man could have such
fearful nerve none but a crazy man or
a born idiot could stand such tests or see
such awful things unmoved something
outside their ken was happening in their
midst happening far too close for ordinary
comfort

  hopelessly the chief decided they couldnt
keep the man there yet dared not harm him
and the gaunt man hopelessly asserted they
couldnt turn him out

  the big chief rose and slowly went outside
the hut loudly he called to where the
cockney squatted and furiously ate then
harshly ordered the men round to fix
a clean hut ready for the little man and
take good care of him

  and on a bed of soft karosses-of soft
brayed goat and sheep and buck and leopard
skins-the httle fellow peacefully slept the
whole long afternoon

  slept as a little child safe in its mothers
arms

  the glowing sun was sinking as the small
man gently woke cozily he turned himself
and rested on an elbow the weak eyes
roving round the hut halted at the entrance
light and dark were quite distinct but
nothing more

  and yet the small man smiled

  quite well he knew the trend of what the
kaffirs said quite well he knew their
superstitions and that in fancied madness
lay his safety and cockney that he was
hed play it to the end

  smiling the little fellow waited for the
next move and felt the night come on yet
numbly wondered what the next move
would be

  the kaffir servant entered and laid a dish
before him beside the dish a calabash of
kaffir beer

  nangu skoff mlungu-theres food
the kaffir muttered shakily then just as
quick as legs and space would let him he
sought the open air

  eagerly the httle fellow attacked the
feed of steaming meal attacked it with
all the hunger of a starving man

  the last full spoon went down and the
httle fellow started in to scrape the dish

  blymey he murmured in happy com-
fort this aint so rotten better than
roostin in a bloomin tree an syfer
than-

  o-o-o-o-oh a long drawn hollow tor-
tured groan-a groan dismal as the howl of

 a tortured soul in - floated in from

 a hut a hundred feet away o-o-o-o-oh
 the little fellows jaw dropped loosely
 his half-raised hand went open and the
 wooden spoon fell down

 o-o-o-o-oh

 o-o-o-o-oh

 the awful groan went high and trailed
 away to nothing then rose again and
 dragged in horrid tune

 o-o-o-o-oh

 the little fellows weary eyes went round
 in helpless terror his well-filled stomach
 quivered his very soul went sick

 o-o-o-o-oh and a screaming curse in
 kaffir then o-o-o-o-oh again

 the little man stood up and staggered to
 the moonlight loudly he shouted for his
 serving man

 the groaning voice said-

 o-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh and muttered
 a stifled curse

 then let a howling screaming screech
 mercy mercy help

 the open space outside the hut was silent
 again the cockney shouted loudly and
 back again came -

 help

 vaguely the little fellow wandered out
 and made toward the place whence came
 the sound perhaps thirty feet hed gone
 a few uncertain steps before a tall gaunt
 man loomed up and stopped him the
 gaunt man made a sudden call

 a vigorous kaffir firmly gripped each
 side the little cockney and turned him
 round firmly yet carefully they steered
 and pushed him back and softly they
 pressed him down and left him on his bed

 shivering he lay there still and listened
 listened and shivered till his very spine
 went cold

 o-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-oh
 hlep

 and all that fearful night and well toward
 the dawn the small man heard that piteous
 o-o-o-o-oh and over and over and over
 a hundred wracking times a whining plead-
 ing help

 o-o-o-o-oh help

 the day was well advanced before the
 little man woke up killed though his
 hunger was the past events and night of
 fearful noises had had their dire result and
 nature answered

 the nervous squatting servant anxious-
 ly waiting for the little man to waken
-

adventure

 quietly rose and brought in food and as
 the cockney ate the unwilling servant
 stood and watched him

  where was the dog which howled all the
 night the little man asked smilingly
 fully he thought to get no clear reply so
 asked off at an angle

  the kaffir smiled queerly

  in that hut which stands at the far side
 of the kraal from insimbe mlungu he
 answered willingly

  what was the matter with him the
 cockney queried hopingly

  sick mlungu very sick

  hurt wounded

  the kaffir laughed a cruel rasping
 laugh

  hurt mlungu badly hurt the dog
 was white mlungu

  for a moment the little fellow hesitated
 and wondered if hed dare to take a chance
 ingratiatingly he smiled

  take me to him madoda i want to see
 his hurts

  without the least reluctant sign the
 serving kaffir instantly agreed

  when the mlungu has eaten i will
 guide him

  with studied slowness the little cockney
 ate then rose and made to move

  take hold of my arm he told the wait-
 ing kaffir my legs are tired and weak

  carefully the kaffir held the mans shirt
 sleeve and steered him out to the open
 plain and through the blazing sun and
 carefully very carefully the little fellow
 reckoned out his direction and counted
 every step

  just ninety steps and then a square
 thatched hut the cockney reached a hand
 and felt the flat square side sharply they
 turned a corner and quickly stepped inside
 the kaffir servant halted stiff

  inside a gloomy dull half-light a bare
 earth floor no sign of blanket box or any
 single thing

  the cockney moved across the floor
 then stood and listened a rasping grating
 breathing struck his ear

  slowly short step by step he drew across
 to where the sound appeared to rise his
 foot hit against something which gave
 something soft and big

  the something groaned turned over and
 looked up

  cockney

  gaw blimey musters you

 quickly the cockney sank upon one knee
 and felt the trembling man before him
 a deft hand went over him and gently
 made a search

musters good - man ow dyou

 get in ere an what in-s name ave

 they done to you

 horse fell and pinned me down for just
 a minute and then they got me there
 were too many of them and they over-
 whelmed us and drove back all they didnt
 kill last night they cut the soles from
 off my feet

 hissed thats what i eard then

 yes cut them off and made no gentle
 surgeons job of it either and from their
 talk tomorrow nights full moon

 myke

 tomorrow nights full moon alf from
 the kind way they threatened and promised
 they mean to kill me then

 the lahsy bleeders the little fellow
 said wholeheartedly

 ders the fellow they pegged out out-
 side

 the little mans rejuvenated brain went
 cold his keen nose faintly twitched

 ed glawses i lost the messin things

 i dunno

 my- the captain said and almost

 smiled you ought to thank your lucky
 stars for wearing glasses and losing them
stamashla mani

 but for that you might now have been
 where poor saunders is

 both men lapsed into silence the little
 cockney deeply thinking the captain
 changed his stiff position and looked up at
 the roof

 tomorrow night theyll kill me he
 muttered presently unless i kill myself
 instead have you a knife alf for just
 a second he paused and here ill have
 to leave you too blind to get away he
 added sadly

 the useless eyes went damp and strove
 to peer close in the captains face

 no fear you aint a-goin to leave me
 the little fellow said emphatically

 it seems it has to be the captain whis-
 pered hopelessly perhaps youll be res-
 cued or find a way back out

 of course ill find a wye musters an
 you too

 i find a way cockney why even if
 i could i cant stand up much less walk
 out

 the little fellows bleary eyes went really
 wet bravely he tried to stop them and
 forced a fluttering smile

walk musters who the - wants

 you to walk im goin to carry you
 wincing the captain turned upon one
 side and stared in dumb amazement

 you carry me why alf youre really
 mad

 mad me foot of course ill carry you 
 the little man insisted

 but alf you little shrimp you cant
 i weigh thirteen stone six

 firteen stone six thats nothin
 slowly the captains agonized face took
 on a curious smile

 nothing a hundred and eighty-eight
 pounds

 thats nothin

 and its a hundred and twenty miles to
 camp

 thats nothin

 but alf you cant i tell you its im-
 possible

 the little fellows face went hard set
 firm in pained disgust

 its not whats firteen stone six
 anywye

 lots more than you can carry

 the little mans strained face went blank
 somewhere in some strange way professional
 pride was wounded

 firteen stone six he said deep in his

throat firteen stone six didnt i used
to be a porter in covent gawding mawket
i cn frow little weights like firteen stone six
rahnd wif one and

  the captains pains went out and he
reached up a hand

  youre fooling alf just trying to make
me happy

  im not the little man insisted angrily
ill tyke you on my back just like a little
byby

  and i cant walk and you cant see
nice chance well ever have

  shut up the little fellow ordered
sharply thats my business you do the
seein let me do the walkin

  the reaching hand gripped harder the
captains eyes went misty and i said
youd never again make a policeman and put
you on as gardener the captain said
ashamed

  oh thats awright the little fellow
whispered

  more hopefully the captain lay and slow-
ly thought it out grasped at a straw yet
hoped it was a tree

  i dont suppose therell be any guard
with me tonight he mused assayingly
therell scarcely be a need to stop me
running off unless he added quietly
they come to worry me again

  theyll let you be the little man
assured leave you to keep your strenf
so that youll suffer all the more

  the- i think youre right cock-
ney

  yus an there wont be any guard wif
me ill tell this bloke to go an you cn bet
e will if e dont go ill bite im

  the little fellow turned a scowling face
upon the waiting kaffir and worked a yam-
mering mouth

  id like to bite that bleeder anywye
he mentioned casually

  the shivering kaffir moved a shaking
foot and stepped a long pace closer toward
daylight the cockneys estimate of his
appreciation of his job was pretty nearly
right

  an ow about a gun the little fellow
queried

  a gun the captain asked in great sur-
prize

  yes a rifle you dont suppose that
we cn go two weeks wifout no food an
i cawnt live on grawss the little fellow
feebly grinned even if i am a orse
adventure

  but a rifle cockney and me youll
never carry all that lot

  again the little fellow grinned at
covent gawding he explained they cd
always put just one more bawsket on me
ead

  i know where my revolver is then the
captain thoughtfully said at least i did
know they put it in a hut two huts away
from this put it with the rifles and saddles
they captured off us

  the little cockney rose to go

  then ill be ere tonight soon as the
kraal gets quiet dont go an get upset
musters

  the captains face bright with new hope
smiled broadly

   upset i never felt so fit in all my life

  the clear bright moon was high the
jet black shadows shortening quietly the
little cockney rose and crossed the well-
swept floor

outside the kraal was silent-
silent as in a country of the dead
away off in the distance a wandering
mongrel dog was howling and from a
scraggy tree an eery owl called but all
around inside the kraal was deathly wierd-
ly still

  with confidence the little fellow stepped
outside the hut and carefully gaged his
direction then on tip toe and noiselessly he
crept off

  just ninety steps and then the square hut
loomed before him and with an out-
stretched hand he felt along its walls
quickly he found the entrance went in
and listened for the slightest sound

  a breathing a heavy breathing and it
seemed nothing more

  musters the little man called in a
sharp whisper musters

  his voice went out and nothing stirred
so slowly he went on the inside of the
hut after the bright moonlight was as
black as sin and for a while he hesitated and
stood again then sharply called once more

  and still no answer

  cautiously the little fellow moved a
couple of paces on moved till his foot
struck at a soft resisting something

  the little man stooped wonderingly and
lightly gripped an arm his other hand
went down to help him lift

  a grappling hand came up and seized one
arm as in a vise a reaching hand caught

at his throat and held a grip of steel

  the little fellows keen sharp nose went
busy

  then both his hands were working over-
time

  the lithe strong kaffir made to rise and
fall upon him the little cockney readily
collapsed and let himself fall flat

  quickly he wrenched his right arm from
the grip then fiercely squeezed the kaffirs
throat to stop a chance of noise his two
legs locked around the kaffirs body and
squirming like a pair of snakes the strug-
gling men rolled over

  gasping for breath the little cockney
loosed his hold upon the throat and raised
the hand that held it to try to free himself
instantly the kaffir drew a rushing gurg-
ling breath and made to start to shout

  both hands together pounced upon the
kaffirs throat and madly tried to pound his
head upon the floor

  and all the time the kaffirs grip upon
the small mans windpipe- was firm and
tight as though twere some machine

and once again they rolled and rolling
kicked and jarred with knee to stomach

  the kaffir loosed his hold upon an arm
wildly his hand clawed round and sought
the white mans face the clawing hand
ripped down across the forehead and thumb
and finger came almost together in the eyes
and gouged

  the httle cockney tried to squeal the
grip upon his throat was killing hopelessly
the little fellow let both hands go free and
he too gouged for eyes

  hissing the kaffir tore his hand from
round the - cockneys neck hissing he
seized the wrist which lay above his face
and with both hands wrenched at it

  and cockneys other hand went back to
squeeze the neck

  musters musters the little fellow
called soon as his aching throat allowed the
breath to pass

  musters musters

  a troubled breathing from the wall close
by stopped and a faint voice called
across

  where are you cockney whats the
trouble

  come elp me quick this blawsted
kaffirs got me an the bleeder wants to
yelp

i cant help cockney fm all trussed
slamashla mani

  roll over then an get my knife an
open it

  i cant i cant im fastened to a peg

  - the little fellow said with horror

and then his nails dug deeper in eyes and
throat and the kaffirs body squirmed

  one hand let go the cockneys wrist and
found his throat again the fingers felt
behind the windpipe and clenched to come
together

  the little cockney gurgled

  hopefully the little mans hand left the
kaffirs bleeding half-blind eyes the
hand went swiftly to his hip and to the belt
around him and shakily unhooked the
hanging knife

  gurgling and fighting for just one gulp of
air the little fellow bravely tried with teeth
to open the big blade

  the blade was rusted and far- too firmly
fixed to move

   snorting the little fellow wrenched fiercely
at the tin opener his other hand mean-
while still tightly gripped the kaffirs
throat the tin opener was fastened so
teeth on it were useless

  desperately the small man turned the
knife around and clenched his teeth upon
the corkscrew bit it and worried like a
dog sharply the corkscrew jerked aside
and stood away at a right gngle

  the grasping straining hand quickly let
go its hold upon the squirming kaffirs neck
and closed upon his mouth with every
ounce of force he still possessed the small
man plunged the twisting screw into the
rasping gullet

  and frantically he stabbed at it again and
yet again and ripped and tore and slashed
and gashed

  - he said weakly

  then limply he crawled off

  a few short moments the panting cock-
ney rested and wiped the trickling blood
from face and neck then felt his way to
where the captain called

  i tried to pick the blighter up the
cockney laughed above his several pains

thought e was you - id a job to

stop im shoutin its lucky all these uts
are pretty far apart

hurt much the captain asked it
made me almost vomit to listen to you
struggling and know that i was useless
that was awright the little fellow
said  e wasnt nothin

  soon the little man forced his knife open

then felt around and cut the fast tied

thongs

  they must have been suspicious when
you left the captain freed explained
put a man here to guard me and bound
me up as well

  a - of a guard e was the little

fellow snorted

  i should have kept awake to warn you
the captain went on guiltily but after that
awful night last night and all this fearful
day i somehow fell asleep

  that was awright the little fellow said
again before this ride youre goin to
take you needed lots of rest now show
me where the guns are but i must take
my boots off first ere you old em he
added presently

  the little fellow closely stooped and
braced himself then lifted up the heavy
captain clear stiffly yet careful of his
feet the captain eased himself around and
on the small mans back

  are them there plates o meat of yours
a-burnin much the little fellow asked
solicitously

 like - the captain said a

fellows feet are just about his tenderest
place

  poor bleeder the little cockney soothed

  the little fellow staggered out into the
moonlight the big man on his back blinking
painfully after being so long in the half dark

  quite silently they moved across to where
the guns were stored and into the hut
and there the cockney laid his burden on
the floor

  better feel for a rifle an your revolver
too he said then stood aside and anxiously
waited

  sure you can carry all this the captain

asked

  certain i can an bring about a score
of cartridges if you cn find em

  the captain found the several things he
wanted then once agair the cockney
lifted him and swung him on his back

  and creeping along like a criminal fear-
ful at every second that some stray dog
might rush out yelping and get them back
to worse than death not even daring to take
the shadow of the huts the little fellow
sneaked along

  half way across the open square the
little cockney stopped his heart stood
still some gray four-footed thing was in
the path
adventure

a bleedin dawg the little fellow
gasped his weak eyes noticing a movement
only a goat cockney thank god
blymey i awmost dropped you the
little cockney said relieved

  and he crept on again

   the captains lips were close to cockneys
ear and as they moved he whispered

   its a hard thing to say alf he said
with so many poor beggars killed but its
good that we were licked these kaffirs
feel so secure in victory that theyre sleeping
like dead men

  well dead em yet the little man
asserted

   and still they crept along

  i know this district well the captain
whispered again as they reached the edge
of the kraal and struck the winding path
a half mile from the foot of this hill theres
a swamp runs back a long way from the
river well make for that

   an walk in the swamp so that itll hide
our spoor eh

  thats right its a sandy marsh and
the grass is high once through it and
theyll never find us

  grawssy the little fellow ruminated
that grawssll give them tender plates o

meat of yours just little-

  the happy captain smiled

  far better that cockney than actual

--itself before a second sunrise

  youre right uncle the little fellow
said and jolted on and down the twisting
slope

  just as the pathway ended the captain
called a halt

  youd better rest here cockney and
put your boots on therell be no more
rocks for quite a weary distance and i can
sit on one of these without much fear of
pain

  awright the little man agreed i
expec ill ave to drop you off a few times in
the swamp an let you rest on ands an
knees

i expect you will carrying me with
mud up over your bootsll be no easy job
no worsen carryin a fifteen foot pile of
bawskets on me ead fru a fick london
crahd the little fellow parried jauntily
the captain forced a smile

  well theres one thing in our favor
cockney with all this scrapping and
marching round of late the grass will be
broke through in about fifty million places

theyll never follow us by broken grass
alone

  thats just what i was finkin the
little man agreed

  and every long hour of that bright
african moonlight night the little cockney
floundered on at times they rested at
times the rasping grass cut across the cap-
tains tender feet and he was almost forced
to whimper

  the little fellows breath was coming
harder his progress getting slower oftener
and still more often he had to stop and put
the heavy captain down

  but one more hour till the first faint
streaks of dawn in the near distance a
jumble of rocky hills

  just a few hundred yards more cock-
ney the tired captain said as cheerily as
possible and we come to a place where the
grounds as hard as steel then we can
leave the swamp without the faintest
trace

  an get into them kopjes

  into those kopjes cockney i know
those kopjes well because ive reason to
in the last rebellion we found so many holes
and connecting caves there we couldnt
rout the kaffirs out so we had to get a
crowd of capeboys to do it for us

  good and the weary little mans
pace quickened then todye im goin to
ide there wif the bloomin rabbits

  and when the glowing sun shot up and
sent its blazing rays across the plain safe
in a deep-set cave the two men lay inert
and rested

  and as a host of straggling kaffir bands
later in the morning crossed and recrossed
the swamp in the far distance and searched
in half a hundred places the fatigue-wrought
men slept innocent and heavy

  and with utter uncaring recklessness
they loudly snored

the sun was high up on the morn-
ing of the second day thoughtfully
the little fellow turned a corner in
the cave in which they lay and weakly
looked at daylight

   weve got to eat musters he said with
firm finality me stummicks wavin up
agynst me back-bone like a flawg

  i think its safe enough the hungry
captain pondered it ought to be we
made another dozen miles in the night

  i fink we must ave the little man
slamashla mani

agreed an there dont seem no sign of
no more chasin kaffirs

  i think theyve given it best myself
cockney the famished captain smiled
i fancy they had reason to or thought
they had he finished

  what reason musters

  i fancy they were scared just scared
themselves

  but ow

  just fancied you had taken me away
by magic and they were afraid to follow
farther thought it best to leave mysteri-
ous things alone

  the cockney loudly laughed

  fine bleedin magic there aint much
bloomin magic in umpin you along

  the captains raw and festering feet were
paining and he winced thoughtfully his
eyes peered at the feet then at the weazened
cockney

  i dont know alf he said with plain
affection it maynt be really magic but

-well its-near it

   unger aint magic the little man
decided sharply youve got to tyke the
gun and chawnce a shot

  if you dont feel too tired and think
that you can carry me until we see a buck
tired t- the little fellow snort-
ed im starvin

  the weary burdened cockney beat his
straggling way through bush and scrub in
spots the grass quite hid him and the cap-
tain clenched his teeth to stifle rising
screams as stalks hit at his feet

  carefully the captain searched the coun-
try for any signs of life or any signs of dan-
ger a second hour had almost passed be-
fore a tiny buck nestling in the shade two
hundred yards away gave hope of welcome
food

  ill get off here the captain said as they
drew slightly nearer you just stay where
you are until i call and ill crawl into better
position

  dyou fink you cn do it the little
cockney asked uncertainly

  of course i can the captain answered
stoutly but in his heart there was a doubt

  and when five minutes later the captain
softly called his face was gray and serious

  i missed him cockney he said with
deep disgust those blasted feet that
slang of yours is pretty nearly right alf
theyre plates of meat sure enough-and

  -	raw meat at that

  the hungry little cockney smiled broadly
that aint the kind of meat were awfter
though but never mind

  im sorry-mighty sorry cockney that
i missed i couldnt see above the grass to
get up closer and as i went to shoot the
darned grass tickled and i winced

  oh thats awright the little fellow
cheered him well soon fix that youve
got to do some of old frank fillis circus
tricks thats all

 some what

  some circus tricks youve got to shoot
off orseback

  and when an hour later the staggering
little cockney beat up wind within a hun-
dred yards of a wondering duyker the cap-
tain fired from off his back and that one
shot went home

  and as the sun set on that glorious eve-
ning faint wisps of smoke rolled from the
entrance to a winding cave and wafted high
into the darkening air

  close by the fire sat a httle cockney who
smiled and hazily watched his cooking while
just beside him lay a waiting big man who
thought the world was mighty good

  and not a kaffir knew or dreamed that
they still lived

  the evening of the fifteenth day came
round thankfully the two men sat high
on a rise and looked to where the police
camp and little settlement lay like a white
spot but six short miles distant

  tomorrow mornin well be ome the
httle cockney said contentedly

  tomorrow morning yes the captain
soulfully agreed tomorrow morning
but cockney he suddenly broke out
why not leave me and go on and get some
kind of conveyance i could aim you
straight and you could steer by the sun
the cockneys useless eyes came sharply
round

  leave you the little man said queerly
leave you behind when weve come all
this wye no uncle im goin to finish up
me job finish it proper

  the captains hand went out and touched
the small mans arm

  cockney i wonder if you ever feel you
should forgive me youre the best soldier
that any gardener ever was

  the little cockney blushed

  ferget it he said and turned away

  in ecstasy the two men sat and still stared
toward the camp the glowingsun was


adventure

falling the night would soon be born

  did you ear somethin the little
cockney queried presently i fought i
eard a shot

  carefully the captain listened-so care-
fully he held his breath i do hear some-
thing cockney something i hate to hear
just now

  each man went suddenly silent and each
mans face went hard

  its firing cockney firing and its
all around inside the camp

  i fought it was the little man agreed
nah what

  trouble again alf we seem to have
escaped it and now run clean back into it
the police must have been driven right in
and now the camps surrounded

  the little cockneys jaw fell loose then
came to with a snap

  thats nothin he said decisively
kaffirs wont fight at night an theyll be
restin well start right nah an i shall
tyke you fru

  take me through cockney youll
never do it

  of course i shall well creep fru in the
dark an get right close to camp then at
the fyntest sign of dawn when the plice cn
see ill myke a rush

  the captain put both fists up to his eyes
and firmly rubbed them then took the
fists away and stared almost with awe
straight at the little man

  its magic cockney he said with deep
conviction magic and nothing else in
all gods world

  the sentry pacing up and down inside
the camp came to a sudden halt and stared
out over the open space and to the line of
bush far out beyond in the dim morning
light he fancied something inside the bush
was moving yet wasnt really sure

  for a full minute he stood and strained
his eyes to pierce the gloom then felt rather
than saw a waving signal

  some trick he muttered drowsily
some wretched kaffir trick and raised
his rifle with pretense of firing

  the rays of light behind the horizon were
shooting ever higher and the tired sentry
more clearly saw a signal

  investigation needed he murmured
and strolled to meet the man on the next
beat

  the man took one good all-appraising
look then turned and shouted-

  spring

  youre right spring said the moment
he came up theres some poor frightened
white man there who wants to rush to
camp

-	anxiously big-hearted spring waved back
then turned and shouted loudly a host of
men came tumbling out from all directions
quickly spring explained

  you fellows line up each side the pas-
sageway into camp ill shout to the fellow
out there to chance it and if the kaffirs
interfere you fire each side him and let him
run in between

  at once the men took up their positions
and spring called at the top of his huge
voice

  and big springs mouth stayed open and
his revolver clattered to his feet

  the man inside the bush stooped down
a lying form rose to sit up deftly the
form was lifted and swung onto his back

  then the little man charged

   the little cockney left the bush and tot-
tered into view full fifty feet then yells
went up and assagais began to fall and
as they fell a scorching rain of bullets
came from the camp and whined each side
the cockneys head

   the little fellow bravely kept his stagger-
ing way the assagais falling quivering in the
sand around him and firing men rushed
out to meet him and help him in

  and grinning and puffing the little man
came on

  but just another forty feet and then the
darned thing got him an assagai lodged in
his calf and flapped and trailed behind as
he went on the little fellow winced his
steps were tottering

  drop me and pull it out the captain
muttered frantically and made to wriggle
down

   the little mans grip tightened his wab-
bling trot went slower

    old fast  old tight i fink i cn do it
i fink i can mind them there plates o-

  a whizzing twisting knobkerrie sang
through the air twisting it fell and
skidded on a stone then bounded up
again

  the knobkerrie came hurtling up hur-
tled and twisted round and round again
neatly it caught the little fellow just be-
hind an ear

  weakly he crumpled up his legs sagged
down limply the little man collapsed
slamashla mani



  flat on his face he lay the captain safe
above him

  and calmly numbly he slid off into sleep

the glorious african sun shone
down upon a crowd of happy men
on three sides of the flat parade
ground lines of police were standing at atten-
tion behind them everywhere were groups
of eager laughing men and smiling women-
several of the smiling women in nurses caps
and uniforms round the wheel chair which
the virile captain musters now scarcely
needed

  and in the center of them all stood gen-
eral lord arthur blumer with cockney
facing him a scant two paces off

 for two long weary months the little
man had suffered now with new glasses
on he listened nervously to all his good
points and suffered ten times worse

 the general read the message from the
queen then made his own great speech
and with one hand above and eyes raised
to it he held the thing most coveted of all-
the rare victoria cross

  the general almost finished speaking the
waiting crowd prepared to scream a
cheer

 then on the road up from the railway
station up from the boat train from cape-
town came horses madly galloping tee-

tering and swaying behind them a near-
careening cape cart

  the cape cart drove on to the square
and men stepped out to stop it it stopped
but some one rushed away and passed re-
straining hands

  a little sharp-nosed woman raced over
to the general raced over and roughly
pushed herself directly in his way stood
right before him a hand upon each shoulder
of the nervous little cockney

  and cockneys eyes stared right above
her and at the rows of ribbon on the gen-
trals breast right clean above her and her
six stone thirteen her ninety-seven pounds

  alf you little blighter the acid lady
blurted her cheeky face six inches below
his i fahnd the bleedin fours-abaht id
in the bloomin bybys crydle

  the generals eyes still staid aloft his
good right hand came down

  for valor he soulfully said and
pinned the cross upon the tiny womans
shoulder

  the little cockneys set mouth trembled
his eyes came from the lengthy rows of
ribbon the eyes came faintly down

  and then a hand came up

  a savage push the sharp-faced woman
staggered a savage push and her hard
face went blank

  get aht lahsy the little fellow growled

                                reader
                                writers

                                                                    jnd

                                v adventurers

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken tbe long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between-
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

    if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

tn connection with his story in this
  issue ferdinand berthoud says

 i dont know how to spell slamashla mani-
nobody does-but thats how it sounds

as to our camp-fire stations each
as it comes into being is given a nunv
ber which may be called its official
designation and which it retains throughout
mr cox suggests that each keeper might
if he cares to choose a name as well as
a number for his own station for exam-
ple a keeper whose experience or interest
lay chiefly in south america might like to
suggest his particular welcome for comrades
familiar with latin america by the name
southern cross station or anything else
suggestive of southern latitudes or of that

 continent in particular the names of
 places or things suggestive or typical of
 places like palms pine trees rio klon-
 dike landfall forecastle new chum etc
 or of famous adventurers places or events
 of history or recent times might also be used

    all a keeper need do is write us the name
  he wants and well register it for his station
  in case of more than one wanting the same
  name the first to be heard from gets it
  a name of course is optional with each
  keeper

 t want to make it plain in advance
 that our system of stations calls for no
 money changing hands there are no dues
 or charges of any kind so far as camp-fire
 and this magazine are concerned and if any
 keeper were to charge for the services
 
the camp-fire



obligatory on him as a keeper or attempt to
turn his station in any way into a money-
making device his sign and number would
promptly be taken away from him of
course if a station happens to be a store
no one would grudge to its keeper any gain
to trade that might result from its being
made a meeting-place and of course when
a station organizes its own local club it is
free to charge its members whatever dues
fees etc may seem best but it is the mem-
bers as a whole not the keeper alone who
must determine any point concerning
charges

  the station idea is certainly taking hold
solidly give us a year or two to develop
them and i think well find weve built up
something far bigger and more valuable
than wed thought possible in the beginning
come across with any advice or suggestions
that will hasten the good work

comething from uncle frank huston
 concerning the death of the apache
kid

napa county california

  i am very much interested in bob heckles
account of how his pardner one clark killed apache
kid

jn  coming out of mexico i ran into the th

  cav at boeie station the commanding
officer col later maj gen m v sumner jr-
invited me to stop over withthe command and later
came to me and we had a long wa-wa on old
times and men apache kids name came up and
sumner said oh theres no doubt the kid is dead
died of smallpox up in squaw basin josh went up
there and identified the corpse and buried the body
i give his words verbatim josh was an apache
scout had been with crawford in mexico when the
captain was killed old billy another pache scout
had been along at the same time now then in
- capt wm d conrad u s a ret and
myself camped in squaw basin on the sites of
both the old camps of pache kid moving from the
first camp when andy mills rode in and told us
that we were sitting on infected ground

tater at ft grant we talked with josh who
once went out and brought in his own brothers
head to the commanding officer at grant col
royal i think it was but wont be sure of this
and old billy the scout after selling me an old
pack-horse adopted conrad and myself and spent
all his off time in our quarters

  both asserted that the kid died of smallpox
billy saying mebbe so no dead but planted any-
way and pooh all rotten like - no pick

him up too soft push him in hole

  a man one night went into andys corral and
took his two horses leaving a couple of worn out
plugs andy heard them leaving and went out
following down into the aravaipa where the doctor
homesteader name forgotten told him whom he

was following as andy later remarked to me

i hadnt lost kids and-quick turned round

and put for the ranch again horses - i

was-glad i wasnt lost myself

tf connection is had with andy mills

  willcox arizona or the nortons barney is
alive yet or the morgans and the old judge at
bonita i forget his name also or the blacksmith
who forged the leg-irons for billy the kid when this
coot killed his first man at that same hog ranch
at bonita you will find no man killed pache kid

   col tompkins now of the th cav may tell
you something of the kid that others havent got
might ask him-uncle frank

in our december  issue in connec-
tion with camp-fire and ask ad-
venture youll remember the short general
article africa the vast and savage by
william ashley anderson of our staff it is
the first of a series not all so long as that
many of them very short indeed and run
every now and then there have been
several similar articles by edgar young
concerning central america these were
the outgrowth of his a a work but it
happens that they and several more to
follow are in line with the idea of this
series though the series plan as first worked
out included only tabloid data

  heres the idea we in the office find
that while we know a little about most parts
of the world when it comes right down to
definite facts and conceptions we are sadly
lacking in many cases had been going
along satisfied with a few definite facts and
a too hazy general conception as to this or
that part of the globe just as in the case
of maps-a fellow thinks he has a pretty
clear idea of the map of some place but let
him try to draw that map even roughly or
be really definite as to relative locations etc
of course in some cases we can muster
a pretty fair knowledge among us-mr
anderson for example lived years in
africa and mr greene also but the
worlds a large place well we figure that
most of you are the same kind of critters
we are and that while some of you know
more geography than we do there isnt any
one of you who knows it all also we find
when we get right down to it and gather the
facts about some country or locality previ-
ously hazy in our minds that we get a whole
lot interested in what we dig up here
again we figure youre no different from us
and are likely to be equally interested
especially if we do the work for you and
just hand you the dope on a platter


adventure

so were going to try it out you can
sit back and criticize and suggest and
help now and then an article like mr
andersons a general survey of a whole con-
tinent sometimes a shorter one on some
one country or river or island thats rather
hazy in most peoples minds sometimes
a continent handled as to one subject only
sometimes the striking but little known
facts concerning some place comparatively
well known

  sometimes it will be a short regular arti-
cle more often just an assemblage of
interesting data sometimes the dope
will be packed into the most compact form
possible-just a condensed paragraph of
data for ready reference no regular rules
about any of this plan-well just browse
around for data and pass em along in
whatever way seems to make a particular
case most interesting our a a editors
will help us out in a way its a a ma-
terial or rather a fine solid background for
a a information

  it wont take up much space and i think
youll find it rather interesting in itself and
that it will make a good many stories more
enjoyable to have a less hazy idea of their
scenes fire in your suggestions and opinions
as these little items appear from time to time

following camp-fire custom nor-
man j bonney rises and introduces him-
self on the occasion of his first story in our

magazine arlington heights massachusetts

   my life history is so uneventful that i am certain
it can be of no interest i have clerked in a bank
and office for thirteen years and have never been
farther from boston than the state of maine i
write stories hoping that they may find favor in the
sight of magazine editors and play chess now and
then to keep my alleged brain in working order

    tis pleasant sure to see ones name in print

a books a book although theres nothin int

  -norman j bonney

in this case-particularly as i cant
find the letters in question-i think it
will be fair to publish only the answer to
them as it indicates pretty clearly the
points they raised but ill use a b and c
for the names of the three men since their
case is not given full statement e o
foster is a pen-name one of only three or
four among the many who write for us so
of course you will not find it on the army
rolls but aside from the authors word in
the matter ive seen in newspaper type
the story of his record

   e o foster isnt sore just rising with
a grin to wrestle with those who seemed to
him to challenge his knowledge of his ma-
terial i dont think hes likely to go far
wrong in handling the material he under-
takes but i can see why they challenged at
least some of the points and this magazine
wants its stories challenged-so long as it is
done pleasantly

an author of course has considerable
liberty in shifting fact material to
suit the purposes of fiction but it happens
that readers of our magazine have come to
expect an exceptional degree of historical
and fact accuracy most of our writers
give it to them in exceptional degree-
have established a standard and readers
naturally measure all stories by that stan-
dard when a story seems not to toe the
mark in this respect they rise to protest
often their points are well taken and their
watchfulness is most important in keeping
up our standard of accuracy there will
always be slips by writers and by us here
in the office but this help from our readers
enables us to keep on a level we need not be
ashamed of in comparison with other
magazines

  and heres an important point readers
have no way of telling whether an author
has taken liberties with facts intentionally
and in full knowledge or merely through
ignorance therefore its all right for them
to ask him to state his case

  the remedy lies right here in camp-
fire i wish all our writers would do what
most of them do-take pains to explain to
camp-fire just where and how they have
taken their justified liberties with facts
historical or otherwise then everybody
will be satisfied ive yet to hear any mem-
ber of camp-fire object to hearing explana-
tions of this kind so a writer need not be
in fear of boring his readers by letting them
in on the inside in fact so far as i can
judge camp-fire is very particularly
interested in just this kind of thing

   here is e o fosters explanation to his
questioners

   will you please extend to messrs a b and c
whether through camp-fire or as you may other-
wise choose my thanks for their interest in the
old spud stories

believing that the columns of the magazine
are for fiction not friction im going to put
it up to your readers as to whether or no officers
the camp-fire

i

of the regular establishment of the united states
army ever use profane language and if a few even
so late as our recent war did not have a bhit o
the brogue

  so far as the setting of any story i write i must
reserve the right so long as my stuff is not labeled
historical to throw different incidents together
to make one complete whole disregarding time and
place in my endeavor to make a story that will
please the great majority of your readers even if it
does jar the sensibilities of a few

  to get down to our mutton

  mr a is right it was the first tennessee and
not the tenth

  the answer to mr c will be found in the third
paragraph of this letter

to major b my answer is a bit different

    first old spud was an enlisted man in the
civil war and was given his commission for bravery
in action as were many officers at that time he
certainly swore and had a rich brogue on occasion
second i with the other men in my company
wore a dog tag the war department orders
will settle this if major b cares to inquire third
got five years to do his in dates back long before
the spanish-american war when there were five-
year enlistments fourth there were big canoes in
the philippines fifth there was a power canoe in
the islands about this time driven by an acme
gasoline engine maybe it did not have a carbureter
but it did have some kind of a thingamajig to mix
the gas sixth since major b is ringing the bell on
his service in the army i will say that i served as
a private soldier over thirty years ago was in the
spanish-american war the philippine campaign on
the mexican border in the world war have held
every grade up ip major in the united states forces
and have held commissions in a foreign army from
colonel to lieutenant-general

  and thats that to quote our good friend
noyes

  in closing i will say that ive got on my tin
kelly and gas-mask let em all come-e o
foster

a word from thompson burtis con-
cerning his complete novel in this issue

langley field hampton va

  it deals with kentucky mountaineers the in-
cident mentioned about the shooting down of a
balloon by moonshiners is fact that illustrates the
fact that their attitude toward a stranded army man
as in the story is not far-fetched

t have tried to portray the best and to hint
briefly at the worst in the mountain people
as a newspaper man covering all the army camps
in the country on publicity work at the start of the
war i came into contact with mountaineers a t camp
taylor kentucky camp lee virginia and camp
hancock in georgia who could neither read nor
write had never seen a railroad train and didnt
know what a postage stamp was some of them were
good but when they were bad they were wildcats

  an interesting sidelight on them proving that
truth is stranger than fiction may be given by this
incident for the truth of which i can vouch in
one of the clan fights a few years ago two men were
always on guard on a hillside above their enemys

house armed with rifles he built a stockade around
the house for two years he never went out with-
out carrying his baby with him thus holding the
fire of his would-be assassins the first time he
ventured outside the shielding stockade alone he
was shot-it took two years of constant watching
to do it there is another case for the truth of
which i can vouch where a man who had killed
another never left his house for eleven years except
for a few minutes at night every one including
the police thought he had got out of the country

  i have met enough of them to know the types
although i am not an authority save in the matter
of repeating the testimony of unimpeachable wit-
nesses who know them inside and out-burtis

a canadian publication says adven-
- ture owes canadians an apology be-
cause in a a we grouped canada under
north american countries it says but
we suppose this is all part of the campaign
across the border to depreciate canada
says parts of the u s are as much snow
countries as are parts of canada

  all right we apologizeto any canadians
who feel an apology is due it hadnt
occurred to us that we were doing anything
unpleasant to canada or wed not have
done it been running that north ameri-
can snow countries in a a for years
and no canadian ever even hinted there
was any slur in it and ive an idea canadians
in general havent suffered much agony over
it but if even a few of them object to it
were pefectly willing to change have
already done so in fact

  it seems to me rather amusing that any
one should make as it were an international
affair of so small a matter campaign to
depreciate canada what campaign

tjut theres a serious side too to this

     so far as i can see two countries never
dwelt side by side in more friendliness than
canada and the u s why try to create
unfriendliness by hunting for trouble so
hard that you find unfriendliness where
there is none it is little things like this
that gradually build up feeling between two
peoples

  on both sides of the border are found
a few who seem to make more or less a
business of suspecting and hating their
neighbors apparently on the benighted
basis that any one outside their own nation
is an enemy and a devil its up to the rest
of us on both sides the line to calm them
down doubtless there are as many of
these trouble-makers in the u s as in
canada ive heard from only a few and


adventure

it only happens that these few were cana-
dians showing their teeth against us be-
cause they said wed been showing our teeth
against them canucks and yanks lets
try to discourage the teeth-seers among us
tooth-talk in this case is merely silly the
only time for quite a while that weve shown
our teeth we were standing at your side
not facing you and you seemed as satisfied
with the situation as we were

  i first learned from canadian trouble-
hunters that the u s wants to annex
canada very possibly they may have got
that idea from some loud-mouthed yank
but ive lived all my life in this country and
have never heard a single american voice
anything like a wish to annex canada
maybe the u s does want to but ameri-
cans apparently havent heard about it
bosh or possibly boche lets forget
this nonsense until some chip-on-the-shoul-
der yank or canuck bobs up again and
needs soothing-sirup

f i he following refers to captain frank-
lins man wanted ad as posted in
the adventurers club of chicago and
quoted at a recent camp-fire asking for
a man to go to india within the next thirty
days to deliver a demented hindu to the
indian government its all over now so
dont apply

  ive an idea none of you would object in
the least to having one of the clubs flags
accompany our expedition and heres hop-
ing one of the club may be a member of the
expedition

   i have received hundreds of letters and scores of
telegrams from readers in answer to the advertise-
ment in the magazine of september th i en-
close one letter which i have answered it has been
impossible for me however to answer them all so
can you mention this please at camp-fire i have
answered all the telegrams the readers of ad-
venture are evidently an adventurous lot

  i enclose a photo of one of our club flags we
have two others out one with sir ernest
shackleton on the quest going to the antarctic the
other with carl akeley going into central africa

  we wish now to make application for one of our
flags to accompany the adventure expedition our
club is taking a great interest in this expedition
and we hope to be allowed to send a member of our
organization with it-capt f j franklin

talbot mundy has lived in this
country a dozen years or more and for
most of that time has been an american
citizen but until recently hes never

been west of indianapolis now hes doing
it plumb to california as a starter after
that anywhere and everywhere hes not
the kind who map it all out in advance he
just goes somewhere and then goes some-
where else and he likes the west-gosh
how he likes it and westerners judging
from his letters the more he likes it and
them the more he hops about the map
apparently trying to see as much of them
as possible as soon as possible says he
this isnt a country its a gosh-blamed
hemisphere full of he men

on one of his hops he sent mi the
following poem which will be familiar
to some of you we have to go sort of easy
on poems in camp-fire you fellows
may not believe it or like it but as a bunch
youre pretty blamed poetical lots of
poems come in from you for camp-fire
some of them mighty good ones but if we
start having poems where will there be
space for the rest of us who cant talk
poetry this poem however is from out-
side our circle so we can take a chance
you never can tell though the unknown
writer of it may turn out to be one of our
number after all if so let him own up
its a good poem

    mr mundy says it was found nailed on
the door of an old prospectors cabin in the
middle of the nevada desert country the
cabin showed signs of having been occupied
for about three years but had been aban-
doned for a long time the man who runs
the cigar store in the riverside hotel at
reno got it from the prospector who found
it on the cabin door and had copies printed
anyhow here it is

camp-fires expedition

to print all the letters concerning the
proposed camp-fire expedition is en-
tirely impossible because of lack of space
yet the only right way is to give to all so
far as possible all the opinions and sug-
gestions that have come in from you so
that as many as possible can have a hand
in shaping the final decisions accordingly
ive tried to take the most essential points
from as many of the letters as we have
room for-sometimes a quotation some-
times a brief statement of the suggestion
or opinion not forgetting arguments and
reasons some of these follow others will
be heard at later camp-fires

   besides letters like the above there have
been a great number that merely declared
in favor of the expedition most of these
promising their support there were no
letters against it except some that sug-
gested some other undertaking in place of
it and these suggestions will be presented

   the expedition undoubtedly has camp-
fires hearty support that means success

   some of the main points to be decided
are shall it be under the auspices of a

museum-an expedition for scientific pur-
   

poses where shall it be sent how
financed what sized shares how man-
aged abbreviations will often be used to
indicate votes on these questions

  treasure-hunting cocos island-john ander-

  with apologies i venture to oar in
it seems well established that rich treasure
was buried on cocos but the many unsuc-
cessful expeditions for it have become a
byword and if we added another to the
long list wed at once be subjects of ridicule
and in any case be doing only what scores
or hundreds of others have already done
theres probably treasure there and prob-
ably some one will find it some day com-
rade anderson has been planning a try at
it and i hope he proves the lucky man but
doesnt the cocos treasure seem particularly
the one that this particular expedition
should not go after

  must be democratic but that need not mean a
fixed amount of two men with salaries f  and
 each giving the same amount the first is
working  times as hard for the expedition as is
the second

as he can publish all names without the amounts
given but giving totals and a list-without names-

not be handled separately in case of organizations

more letters later as you see there are
all kinds of differences of opinion remem-

i	took particular pains to bring out the
points on which there were differences all
the way through on the other hand i cut
out most of the endorsements of the plan
as a whole leaving this to be inferred from
the fact that theyd written in with opinions
and ideas also remember that i have
omitted entirely all the many letters that
merely endorsed the expedition without
taking up specific points

  looks to me as if a systematic vote would
have to be taken if i wait till you can
vote unsystematically on how the vote shall
be taken it will mean delay of two or three
months so we in the office will just go
ahead consider carefully the suggestions
already offered on voting-method fix up
the best one we can and get it into operation
off-hand the best general plan seems the
one suggested by ohioan of printing in
the magazine the various questions to be
decided and numbering each question
then any or all of you can send in a post-
card or letter giving your vote on each
number

  well try to give you more letters at our
next camp-fire the bunch we already
have on hand will give you a pretty good

life and trade in central america

pearls furs guano timber gums-insects that fatten their
meat ration on mushrooms

by edgar young

seems that a chain of trading-
posts similar to those of the hud-
sons bay company in canada
would be an immense benefit to
both central america and the people who
ran them american products could be in-
troduced in this manner and native prod-
ucts that are now unknown could be brought
out and a market found for them

  a company large enough to run their
own boats down from here a communica-
tion inland from the coast and the employ-
ment of the right kind of men to run the
posts should make a go of it there are
numerous rivers that are navigable for
good-sized vessels or up which flat-bottomed
river-boats could be run and ideal locations
along both coasts for the placing of cheap
bamboo buildings until the erection of bet-
ter ones was guaranteed by the volume of
business

  ivory-nuts sugar coffee tobacco ma-
hogany ebony gold dust pearls opals
and even corn beans and such products
could be traded in to the post for machetes
axes small machinery clothing agricul-
tural implements and general merchandise
such a business that would help develop
these rich countries should look good to
some enterprising capitahst

  an individual with small capital could
start a business of this kind in a small way
the building of a bamboo-thatch house is a
small matter and the expense is very light
or a building could be rented in some small
place for a few dollars a month and the
start be made with a very few hundred
dollars worth of goods the department
of commerce at washington is acquainted
with the duties into each country

  a man with what he can carry in on his
back provided he goes into the right part
can make money out of his trip the head-
waters of almost all of the rivers flowing
into the atlantic from nicaragua and hon-
duras are good trading-centers for this class

of trader one trip in will give a man an
idea of what he can make the most out of
the next time

  where an individual reckons on trading
in heavy articles such as rubber vanilla
etc he can build a raft of bamboo and
float his cargo out to the coast for a man
who intends peddling jewelry there is no
better place than among the coffee fincas
of guatemala both the owner and his
family and the laborers will buy the former
a fine grade the latter a cheaper and flash-
ier at some of the larger fincas there are
many hundred employed

  what might be classed as standard trade
goods are blue overall-pants calico and
blue work-shirts

  for one who intends trading in the cities
the following method is suggested the
goods are brought in trunks or boxes and
the customs paid on them in the usual man-
ner a room is rented in some hotel and
the goods displayed on tables or shelves
advertisements are inserted in the local
papers stating what is being offered and the
purchasers are asked to call as a rule
they are so anxious to get american prod-
ucts that everything is gone in short order
and advance orders can be taken

  for trading of this kind only the best
should be taken americans and britishers
who happen to reside in the city are good
patrons and expect to pay high prices
some of them are likely to want quite an
order brought down the next trip

  this class of trading is fairly new to cen-
tral america although quite common in
south america one trader disposed of
ninety thousand dollars worth of silk
pajamas paper napkins etc in santiago
chile in one week

  a certain amount is allowed free entry
for personal use it is always the best plan
to pay the full duty in a lawful manner
even if approached bv people who make a
business of helping to smuggle goods in


life and trade in central america



  there is a great field for men with capital
to buy up shipments of native products in
the large cities and towns for cash and
export them american money especially
gold is always at a premium more so since
the conclusion of the war than before

  pearls in its purity liquid beauty
and charm of romantic and poetical associa-
tion the pearl-aristocrat of gems-leads
even its peers of the highest rank the dia-
mond the emerald ruby and sapphire   
it seems almost like desecration to reduce
the lustrous pearl to the concrete mineralogi-
cal base of carbonate of lime    pearls
are concretions of carbonate of lime found
in the shells of certain species of mollusks  

  the smallest pearl in commerce is less
than the head of a pin the largest pearl
known is in the beresford hope collection
in the museum at south kensington lon-
don its length is two inches and circum-
ference four and a half    pearls range in
color from an opaque white through pink
yellow salmon fawn purple red green
brown blue black and in fact every color
and several shades of each    the beauty
and value of the pearl in brief depends upon
color texture or skin transparency or
water luster and form pearls most de-
sired are round or pear-shaped without
blemish and having the highest degree of
luster   

  it is authoritatively stated that the
finest single strand of large pearls in exis-
tence was recently acquired by a western
millionaire of the united states the
strand is composed of thirty-seven pearls
ranging from eighteen to fifty-two and
three-quarters each the latter being the
largest central pearl the pearls combined
weighed  grains and the strand is said
to have cost its possessor four hundred thou-
sand dollars from a book of precious
stones by julius wodiska new york
 g p putnams sons

  by the foregoing it is made known that
the pearl a small bit of carbonate of lime-
one of the cheapest of substances-is manu-
factured into a beautiful gem by certain
oysters conches and mussels it can be
correctly classed either under fauna as the
product of a living shellfish or under min-
erals as being composed of carbonate of
lime it is usually to be found under the
latter classification

  a great many pearls are to be encoun-

tered all along the pacific coast of central
america from mexico to colombia and a
few are found on the atlantic coast and in
the fresh-water mussels of the rivers but
these latter finds are so few as to be negli-
gible

  the finding of pearls along the pacific
coast of costa rica nicaragua honduras
and salvador is a rather haphazard and
disorganized affair covered by grants and
concessions from the governments the
pearl islands a possession of the republic
of panama are the seat of quite a large
pearl-fishing industry which is well organ-
ized

  before the war a few buyers trom
england france and germany circulated
up and down the coast buying whatever
pearls they were able to find in the hands
of the natives some of which it is to be
feared were held out on the concession-
holders as mr wodiska states all pearls
of round and pear shapes without flaws are
valuable there is a saying among pearl-
buyers that a pearl is worth what you say
it is for its value is greatly enhanced when
it is desired to match info necklaces and
collections

  besides the gems large mollusks are fished
for on account of their shells-mother-of-
pearl being of great value-and also as a
food some of the shells taken along the
pacific coast are of immense size

 mahogany find ebony the mahog-
any industry is fairly well organized after a
primitive fashion local buyers travel from
end to end of the country and much
mahogany is to be found in almost any of
the ports this wood does not grow in
forests as is popularly supposed but grows
at random here and there in the jungles its
great size and peculiar-colored foliage hav-
ing earned for it the title of king of the
forests

  the method used in logging this wood is
as follows a spy is sent out to climb tall
trees and search out any mahogany that
may be in the vicinity trails are slashed
to them and they are marked for cutting
which is done at a certain season of the
year according to a local superstition which
forbids cutting them except during the
waning of the full moon this superstition
is perhaps based on the fact that the sap
is less abundant and the wood less likely to
check if cut at this time and may have
adventure

foundations in scientific fact the logs are
hewn square dragged to the nearest stream
with oxen and floated to market or if good
roads are in the vicinity hauled to market
in heavy antiquated ox-carts

  many times reports have been current
that all the mahogany in central america
was exhausted but a large quantity con-
tinues to come out each year from all of the
various countries and recently the united
states government bought up great quan-
tities to be exported to this country for the
constructing of aeroplane propellers these
reports have possibly originated in the erro-
neous belief that mahogany is a slow-grow-
ing tree

  mahogany has three distinct growths per
year accounting for the many giowth-rings
shown on the logs it will grow to cutting
size in twenty years and show twenty rings
and to immense size in forty and show one-
hundred and twenty rings

  the ebony industry is also fairly well
organized but not so thoroughly as the
mahogany industry there are many va-
rieties of true and false mahogany and
ebony many of which when dressed almost
defy detection consequently it is well
for a prospective buyer to know the existing
differences rank amateurs have become
proficient in a very short time by using
high-powered microscopes and examining
the make-up of small bits carefully to note
the cell-construction of both true and false
varieties	

  other hardwoods one of the sani-
tary squad with the i c c on the zone
went into the jungles and brought out over
a hundred varieties of hardwoods which he
dressed polished and oiled some were
extremely fine of texture and beautiful of
color

  this leads one to believe that many others
of the native trees are just as valuable for
fine cabinet work and furniture as the well-
known mahogany ebony and lignum vitae
there exists at present a small market for
the following

  silk cotton santamaria sunwood sapo-
dillo mangrove mangrove-grape native
pine cedar and oak ironwood mahoe
locust almond and granadilla

  other valuable timbers recently
an immense quantity of raftwood or balsa
a wood half as heavy as cork was exported

to this country for the making of life-
preservers for the united states navy
great forests of bamboo exist along some
of the rivers locally this giant grass is
utilized in several ways such as for making
unsinkable rafts of the logs-some of which
are more than a foot in diameter-for split-
ting and nailing on as siding for houses for
making an almost indestructible piling by
driving and filling with sand for cutting
the individual joints into bottles kegs and
pails and many other more or less useful
purposes during the scarcity of dye in
this country the forests of central america
were resorted to for dyewoods with which
to dye army uniforms and other cloth
the best known of the dyewoods are fustic
yellow sanders brazil-wood dragons-blood
nicaraguan-wood and anotta

  gum-bearing trees the most popu-
lar if the least known gum is chicle used
for making the familiar chewing-gum of
this country other gums taken from cen-
tral america trees that have a high com-
mercial value are balsam gum arabic
copaiba copal liquid amber palma-christi
and rubber many other gum-bearing
trees exist which might be exploited with
great profit

  trapping little trapping is carried on
in central america by the native people
possibly due to the warmth of the climate
and the absence of the need of heavy furs
in winter among the furs which they
could supply to northern markets are the
following otter raccoon puma jaguar
ocelot ounce panther fox and conejo
pintado the skins of large snakes igua-
nas and young alligators have a high com-
mercial value for making ladies hand-bags
belts etc

  alligator skins and shark skins are bought
by jewelers for mounting a heavy exporta-
tion of deerskins occurs from costa rica
nicaragua and honduras each year

  preparing furs for market mr

samuel lewis importer and exporter of
furs and skins twenty-ninth street be-
tween sixth and seventh avenues new
york city has been kind enough to write
down directions for preparing furs for mar-
ket so as to not render them valueless as
might happen should one not know how to
proceed he has to say in part
life and trade in central america



     i will try to enlighten you as well as my
   knowledge of about twenty years experience
   will permit me to first as to handling furs
   for shipping purposes i would advise after
   skinning to stretch the skin as much as you
   possibly can but be sure it is done smoothly and
   as evenly as possible and then fasten or nail it
   down flesh side out never rub any alum
   arsenic or salt on the pelt as the chemicals they
   contain will injure it and sometimes make it
   absolutely worthless for marketing

     as to the drying i would suggest that after
   your skins are properly stretched and nailed
   down scrape off all the meat and fat with a
   large dull knife so that you do not cause any
   cuts or damage to the skin place it in a dry and
   shady place for drying in a warm climate
   they should be placed in a cool place out of the
   way of bugs or flies under mosquito-nets
   never dry a skin near a fire or in the sun
   always let them stay on the boards until they
   are dried out fairly stiff

     as to packing never fold or crease skins
   but try to pack them as near flat as you can
   and when packing try to place fur side to fur
   side then paper between where pelt meets pelt

     i know of no books on furs but can suggest
   the department of commerce washington

   d c which can probably give you some very
   good advice as to the amount of central and
   south american furs that have been received
   here also the last prevailing invoice price of
   same

  guano in the numerous caves of hon-
duras and nicaragua as well as in parts of
guatemala and costa rica quantities of
bat guano or manure have been deposited
by swarms of bats that cling to the sides
and roofs of these subterranean caverns
during the war due to the absence of
nitrates the value of this was very high
being something like eighty dollars per
ton even in peace times this guano has a
high value as fertilizer some one who
deals in such imports should be consulted
as to prevailing prices and demand

  flora and fauna with its great diver- v
sity of climate due to elevations difference
of rainfall of the two coasts and prevailing
winds central america is rich in natural
flora and fauna and in opportunities
thereby opened to the merchant with a
few notable exceptions the flora is almost
unknown in this country but those hav-
ing access to the zoological gardens of the
larger cities are fairly familiar with a ma-
jority of the larger animals especially the
larger cats the tapir the peccary and other
mammals as well as various reptilia and
birds

  among the insects the knowledge is more
limited being confined to books dealing

with species of butterflies and a few of the
other smaller insects among which may be
named the dragon-fly a study of which
by the calverts made in costa rica has
filled a very large volume a party organ-
ized by the new york zoological park
and headed by one of the curators has just
returned from a long investigation into and
a collecting of many interesting species of
birds reptiles insects and small mammals
in the interior of central america in some
of the least known spots and will doubtless
add much to the existing knowledge

   nicaragua is especially revered by natur-
alists for it was in this country many years
ago that the renowned thomas belt made
valuable discoveries in regard to ants mak-
ing known for one thing that the leaf-
cutting ants grew tiny fungoids upon the
remains of the decayed leaves which they
stored under ground and that they rfeither
ate the leaves nor the fungoids but ate a
tiny mite that lived on the diminutive
mushrooms much has been said about
the wisdom of the ant and this man brought
to light many interesting facts that were not
known before see a naturalist in nica-
ragua thomas belt e p dutton  co
-

  central america offers a wonderful field
for one who likes to delve into the mys-
teries of nature at its best and with modern
instruments much valuable information
could be brought to light it appears that
a man to be a real naturalist has to have a
little of the rip van winkle in him-not
the sleeping proclivities but the patience
he displayed when hunting and fishing
it is said rip tramped for hours over lonely
hills without so much as sighting a squirrel
and sat for hours with a heavy pole without
getting as much as a nibble according to
his own statement washington irving was
a poor student in school and doubtless
gave the lazy rip these good qualities
through envy

  fruits the following list while not
complete will give an idea of the immense
variety of fruits to be found growing wild
or under cultivation in some part or other
of central america

  chirimoya avocado or alligator pear
granadillo manzana rosa negrito lebibo
banana coconut supa melocoton sonsa-
pote zapotillo caimito guava manza-
nillo sandia papaya mango tamarind
adventure

zapote jacote almendro mamay granado
cacao and cacao-mico citron pimiento
mulberry apricot orange lemon lime
grapefruit coffee sweet-lemon olive pine-
apple grape quince wild-plum various
cantalopes and muskmelons nance as well
as many of our own familiar temperate zone
fruits nuts and berries apples pears
and peaches act peculiarly at sea-level
bearing fruit flowers and buds all at the
same time however in a high altitude they
fall into something like their regular habits

  domestic animals the principal do-
mestic animals are the dog canis domesti-
cus goat cat ox ass and a few mules
and horses of small size many wild ani-
mals have been domesticated for household
pets and are prevalent enough to be worthy
of mention the principal one is the mon-
key of many varieties peccary and the
raccoon-like pisote locally called pizarro
and pizarro solo for the two varieties as
pets also the raucous parrot of many sizes
and kinds the macaw and other forest
birds are also worthy of note

  wild animals and game the largest
of the mammals is the tapir or anta which
attains a weight of about eight hundred
pounds this animal has a long and
extremely flexible proboscis which is really
an extension of the nose and upper lip form-
ing a sort of trunk about half as long in
proportion to its size as the trunk of an
elephant its heavy body and short legs
are not unlike those of a well-fattened hog
but its skin is soft and covered with a heavy
coat of fine hair its hoof is composed of
three huge toes

  it roams the low swampy ground after
the manner of the rhinoceros and is short-
sighted to a marked degree similar to this
same animal but does not submerge itself
under the water although it frequently
wades and wallows in shallow pools upon
being molested it either makes a fast charge
toward the sound and having missed run-
ning down the enemy keeps on going at top
speed or it dashes away in the opposite
direction

   the meat of this animal is dtlicious and
highly prized by both natives and foreign-
ers resembling very closely the beef of a

young steer for this reason it is locally
called vaca del monte or vac a silvestre moun-
tain or wild cow by the natives the west
indian negroes who have settled along the
atlantic coast call it by these english
names

   it thrives and is very docile under domes-
tication the two specimens to be found in
new york zoological park being among the
most popular animals there with the keep-
ers who often bring bits of cake from their
own tables to feed them but no organized
raising of them has ever been attempted in
central america for their flesh and tough
skin

  the other larger game animals are the
large cats locally called lions and tigers
but known to us as puma and jaguar the
rarely existing black tiger the lobo or wolf
the wild hog which is said to be from the
imported domestic breeds the peccary of
two varieties several varieties of deer and
the immense aquatic mammal manatee
which is supposed to be the foundation of
maritime superstition regarding mermaids
the monkey raccoon opossum squirrel
ant-eater armadillo gibeonite sloth co-
yote hare pisote and some of our own small
rodents constitute the remainder of the
principal animals

  birds currasow or wild turkey of sev-
eral varieties parrot hawk vulture owl
sea-eagle crow blackbird jay ricebird
swallow rainbird humming-bird pelican
muscovy and black duck curlew plover
spoonbill teal darter heron ibis crane
partridge quail snipe pigeons and doves
the quetzale or bird of liberty of guate-
mala and a great variety of others both
large and small

snake corral tamaquasa tortoise turtle
lizard iguana chameleon and various others

  fish and sea-food oyster lobster
crab rockfish kingfish hogfish parrotfish

ter and sister-in-law

ing to get to florida some time in december

water also will they keep water cool will bags
leak if sides come in contact with anything

  answer by mr liebekentucky is not in my
territory of the ask adventure service i can
give you up-to-date information on the route if you
come via chattanooga and atlanta if you dont
inquire at one town or city as to the best route to the
next at garages

  go from chattanooga to atlanta via rome not
via dalton its longer but a far better road regu-
lar route from atlanta to macon you can cut
macon out and save miles by going across from
barnesville via ft valley to perry if you like
go from perry down to ashburn all these towns in
georgia and there make specific inquiry as to route
via tifton and valdosta to madison florida unless
the report is very good better turn to right and go
to madison via sylvester moultrie and quitman
this was the best road i ever saw last time i was
over it but is longer than to go via valdosta val-
dosta by the way is about the prettiest little city
in georgia

  go from madison florida to live oak to lake
city and to high springs these towns all in
florida at high springs inquire as to best route to
gainesville whether via alachua or newberry
gainesville is floridas main seat of education
from gainesville go by regular rotite to ocala lees-
burg eustis and orlando orlando is the best
town in florida and a sort of hub from here
you can go anywhere you like

  this route cuts out jacksonville roads through
georgia to jacksonville are apt to be very bad espe-
cially from waycross down i paid  per mile to be
i

adventure

dragged through mud half-way of the radiator on
some of that road last summer it took three
negroes and four mules and my six-cylinder car

running like the - in low with chains on all

wheels-and it ruined a  paint job id just had
done on the old boat now to your specific ques-
tions

  	i always got water in towns we passed through
carried it in gallon bottles and never boiled it it
should be boiled if taken from country wells or
springs after you get half-way of georgia i never
treated water in any way except by boiling

  	cant tell you anything about water-bags
jugs or bottles are o k

  	you will have to take out non-resident license
for hunting which comes high everywhere or else
take a chance no license necessary for fishing un-
less for the market i always carried a revolver in
the car and was never bothered about it in
states that have the new wild-life law it is unlaw-
ful to carry a shotgun or rifle except in the hunting
season florida has it

  	not a great deal of danger of the family being
molested in camp i should say while you work near-
by towns camp close to town and teach the wife
how to shoot practically no danger at all perhaps

  	the roads are usually better in september and
october than at any other time of year most roads
off main highways are passable unless very wet

  	employment after you get here ordinarily i
should say yes but as i write this it is probable
that work will be a little scarce however theres
a way wherever theres a will wages are about
like they are anywhere else

  	dont know a thing about compasses i al-
ways used indian logic in the woods-and a big
thing is to keep direction in your head and remem-
ber what you see ive beat men with compasses
this way its nearly always sunshine down here
you know and if you know what time of day it is
what do you need of a compass the suns in the
east in the morning and in the west in the after-
noon and you can locate certain stars after sun-
set etc

  	any kind of light water-proof tent is all right
cut out poles and ridge-pole by stringing it on a rope
between trees or between your car and a tree this
will give you a headlight for light if the car faces
the tent i used to carry a tent that covered the
whole car and left a space on either side for a folding
army-type bed our two children slept in the car
seats the only objection was that the blamed
thing was too heavy to handle and to carry

  	you are not apt to be troubled with anything
in the shape of insects except mosquitoes and not
much with these in the winter these can be
kept out by cutting a window in either end of the
tent and closing it with mosquito-netting

  in case of snake bite do this bind the limb tight
above the wound cut a cross-mark as deep as the
snakes teeth went in each little wound if no abra-
sions on the lips suck the wound then fill the cuts
with moistened crystals of permanganate of potas-
sium and shoot into the surrounding tissue a solu-
tion of this same permanganate with a hypodermic
and release the cording a little to keep the flesh
from dying these of course are emergency
measures

  a doctor should be had as quickly as possible
after the binding of the limb but you are not at
all apt to be bitten there are not many poisonous

snakes down here except in the very wildest places
see your doctor as to the permanganate solution

  	as to medicines i would take along anything
i was apt to need iodin aromatic spirits of am-
monia aspirin something of the nature of sodium
phosphate or sal hepatica etc with an emergency
roll of bandage cloth youre not apt to need the
latter-named but you never can tell

  as to dehydrated foods ive never used them
but i imagine theyd be all right you can buy
anything you want in the towns you pass through

  	ive never used field-giasses doubtless
there are any number of good makes we dont
have much opportunity to use them here its a
wholly flat country

  if this is published your name will be omitted
the magazine does not publish names against the
inquirers wishes

  i believe this answers your letter wish you
good luck and an enjoyable trip down

the south american amazons

the origin and history of this myth are
interesting

  question-can you give me any information
on the tribe of women warriors that inhabited the
northern part of south america known as the
amazons my grandfather crossed and recrossed
the isthmus many times and told tales of the ama-
zons along with other stories of s a what i wish
to know is was there ever a tribe of that kind and
if so are they still in existence

  please give me the habits of the people inhabiting
the central part and western part of brazil their
friendliness to the whites and the prospects of
finding gold or some valuable metal to pay the cost
of trip would one want to travel solely by boat
or by boat and burro-w i robertson lim-
erick n y

  answer by dr goldsmith-it is rather curious
that this story about the women warriors being
in any way connected with the amazon region of
south america should crop up again the ama-
zons according to greek legend were a race of
women that dwelt in the neighborhood of the black
sea and the caucasian mountains they were sup-
posed to compose a state from which men were
excluded and to have devoted themselves to war
and to hunting and according to legend they were
often in conflict with the greeks of the heroic age
the amazons and their contests and customs were
a favorite theme in grecian art and story

  these supposed amazons were probably nothing
more than priestesses but they got on the imagina-
tion of the greeks and their followers in culture and
consequently of the spaniards and portuguese
when the spaniards discovered south america and
reached the waters of the amazon they heard the
legend of female warriors and they applied to them
the name amazons and to the region rio de las
amazonas or river of the amazons the
story of the tribe of warlike women spread over
south america and then throughout the world but
there seems to have been no ground whatsoever for
it there certainly was no such tribe and we have
no reliable information regarding any considerable
numbet of unusual women no such tribe therefore
exists at the present time
ask adventure



 the central and western part of brazil is inhabited
by the descendants of europeans or europeans by
native indians of many tribes and with many
languages by negroes or by people of mixed blood
in general they are friendly enough to outside people
of european or of north american stock which is
what i suppose you mean by whites

  much gold and silver are to be found in brazil
gold particularly in the state of minas geraes as
to whether it would pay or not no one can say if
one were energetic fortunate and had funds on
which to maintain himself for a sufficient length of
time he would doubtless succeed many parts of
brazil can be reached by railroad and steamer
as to other parts all would depend upon where one
desired to go

hydah canoes again

mr catton supplements an earlier
ask adventure questionand answer
with the following very interesting informa-
tion it indicates that the age of specializa-
tion of products had already dawned among
the indians of the north pacific coast
when the white man showed up

tweed ont can

  re mr schwalms question to mr carson re
hydah or haida canoes in issue of november 


  haidas were premier canoe-builders of the
pacific if not of the world made canoes for other
pacific coast tribes niskas giatkatlas tsimsheans
etc bela-bela indians also canoe builders but not
in same class

  haida canoes ranged from seventy-two feet in
length-war canoes-down to twenty feet and even
less were dugouts made from single red-cedar
trunk accommodated with ease from twenty to
thirty men-the largest were artistically molded
and very finely finished outside and in and were
often decorated at stem and stern and frequently all
over with designs done in teeth and mother-of-pearl

  they were widest at the middle and tapered to a
point at either end and the prow was higher than
the stern only trouble was their tendency to split
lengthwise the way of the grain which was over-
come with ribs

  they were supplied with thwarts of three-inch
cedar lashed in with twisted cedar bark stood up
and weathered the worst storms on the long miles
between islands and between islands and mainland
and coastwise were used with sail and driven
with paddles and poled up-stream against currents
were steered with sweep at stem or with paddles
according to size war canoes manned by twenty
or more men or with sail or both outran the earlier
power-boats in the same water

  free-lance trading in the south seas
gplendid way to lose money

  question-the writer spent some nine years in
the pacific having lived in the hawaiian and fiji
groups but has been out of touch with this part of
the world for about ten years

   i am writing you for information on the possibility
of trading in the different groups my idea is to sail
from new york or the maritime provinces in a -
ton registered schooner with auxiliary power carry-
ing freight and passengers the passengers will
pay a certain sum for the trip taking with them
trade goods or any standard line of manufactured
articles that you would advise our intention is to
visit australia making a through trip stopping at
any islands where we can trade

   what i would ask you is what flag would be the
best to sail under what islands should we visit
and what trade goods should we take and what
would we take in trade from the islanders

   i might say that we have all the time in the world
how long a trip would it be approximately visiting
the islands you suggest and spending whatever time
necessary to trade what are the trade regulations
of the islands you suggest

   we will sail through the panana canal visiting
jamaica on the way and taking on a load of hooch
for local and foreign consumption i might say that
that we are not booze-fighters but if you have lived
in the islands you will realize the necessity of having
something on your hip

  from panama what route would you advise
should we sail directly to tahiti or visit any other
islands lying off the coast of south america

   it is possible at the present time to purchase from
manufacturers here surplus stores of almost any
goods desired do you think that american goods
will sell in these islands if i have left out any
questions i shall have to depend on your good na-
ture to inform me

  would it pay us when we get to the islands to
carry freight from one to the other or to new zea-
land or australia or america

   i would be pleased to reimburse you for any ex-
pense you may be put to in answering this letter-

	b t nase new york

  answer by mr charles brown-after the ut-
most consideration i am minded to write you as
follows

   your idea of sailing a -ton registered schooner
into the south seas is a good one but the chances
are ten to one that the venture or is it an ad-
venture will go down in the log as a financial
catastrophe the reasons are obvious 

   because of the prohibitive exchange rates south
sea islanders have practically stopped buying amer-
ican goods months ago they learned that it is
cheaper to send all the way to france england
australia and new zealand for the commodities
they need america will have to do considerable
price-cutting before she can compete in the south
seas with these countries

  another thing is against you it is the uncon-
testable system built up by the great south sea
trading-companies concerns with millions of dollars
behind them they would make things so hot for
you and your passengers that all of you would be
lucky if you escaped with your hides and behind


adventure

these companies are the trading-laws and tariff
duties of the various groups too no trader or
planter would think for one moment of letting you
have a cargo for he knows too well on which side
his bread is buttered

  i do not know where and under what conditions
you would dispose of your hooch in most of
the groups it is a criminal offense to give or sell
liquor to natives i tell you that the south seas
have changed in the last ten years even in beau-
tiful tahiti the paris of the south pacific things
are not as they once were

  as i have never had occasion to register a vessel of
any description save sundry schooners of cali-
fornia steam beer i can not advise you as to what
flag you should sail under nor can i say how long
your trip will take ever there are unforeseen mis-
haps and delays to contend with

  if things were favorable for such a trip i should
sail from panama over to the marquesas islands
then through the paumotus and on up totahiti
and the other society islands

  i have been very candid perhaps a bit brutal but
i just dont want to hear of you and your passengers
losing good american dollars at this time theyll
be needed this winter

two-purpose shotgun

one barrel is full cylinder the other
full choke

  question-what make and type of shotgun
would you recommend for me to purchase our
hunting will all be done in a hilly and heavily
wooded country necessarily at short range

  can i get a gun which will be all right for both
rabbits and birds would you advise a double-
barrel or pump gun what ar the advantages
and disadvantages of both

  i imagine that in this sort of a country a straight-
cylinder barrel would be better than a full or medi-
um choke am i right would you advise a
twelve gage or something smaller

  any other hints you might be able to give me in
the handling or selection of a gun will be greatly
appreciated what do you know about the three-
barreled combination shotgun and rifle is such
a weapon practical-r l bowman fairmount
w va

  answer by mr thompson-the only gun i
know of that would suit your specifications in every
way is made specially by the ithaca gun co
ithaca n y though possibly any other firm can
make it for you it is their  gage with sunken
rib it has the right barrel full cylinder and the
left full choke and is very light for that gage
for your purpose on account of the difference in
barrels it will suit you in every way it is a splen-
didly constructed gun and yon have the open
barrel for close shooting and another for long
distance

  i have never liked the three-barrel combination
rifle and shotgun the balance was  altogether
wrong and it was not right for birds they are
no longer made in this country but are made by
sauer in germany and marketed under the name
of fred adolph geneva n y as you shot a
rifle well you will easily get on to a shotgun

the climate of bermuda

onderful but you cant live on
climate

  question-i take the liberty of writing you on
account of invitation extended by adventure to
ask for some information in regard to bermuda and
other west india islands

  what is the climate year round of bermuda
islands a as to health b as to pleasantness

  are there any business opportunities there or in
other west india islands for a man of small capital
say from  to 

  what of social conditions in bermuda and other
british islands

  are the same heavy taxes levied there as in the
mother country

  what of the fishing and wild-fowl shooting

  can board be secured at a reasonable figure in the
islands-the rev c w boyd sumter s c

  answer by capt dingle-bermuda enjoys what
i believe is one of the most perfect climates in the
world speaking out of an experience which covers
a quarter of a century of travel and extends to very
nearly every known land perhaps you might con-
sider it hot at some times during summer but it
never reaches the summer heat of new york or
charleston it is healthy for any except asthmatic
subjects i believe

  i have lived here some three years with two grow-
ing young daughters and none of us has suffered
ill health to such an extent as we did while living
around new york staten island long island or
maryland

  as for business opportunities i can not paint so
pleasing a picture the place isnt big enough
social conditions here are good-about on the
english standard-and taxes are light fishing is
good-that is deep-sea fishing-but there is no
shooting at all except at clay pigeons or occasional
tame rabbits

  board usually is high capitals intentional
bermuda is a winter resort and residents pay
accordingly boarding-house and hotel keepers
and merchants generally make a fair living the
rest shuffle along pretty promiscuously unless they
either have means of livlihood independent of
place-as writers artists or independent persons-
or enjoy a clerical living here it seems to be a
paradise for brethren of the cloth

  i understand from your parish that you are
american why not try porto rico the virgin
islands or even land nearer home if the islands
are preferred the virgin islands are not to be
despised by any means let me know your views

homesteading in western canada

f i he lands there but its miles from the
     railroad

  question-i would like some information about
homesteading in canada how much land can
one man take up when is the best time in the
year to come up there two of us are coming up
there next year and any information you give us
will be appreciated how much cash would it take
toget started i think we have enough to get
started by cutting the comers close-w h nay
clarksburg w va
lost trails



  answer by mr hague-there is good land
ivailable in both manitoba and saskatchewan for
homesteading the land in saskatchewan is heavier
than that in manitoba but all is eminently suited
for grain-growing by writing to the lands
offices at prince albert saskatchewan and dau-
phin manitoba you can get particulars regarding
land open for homesteading in those two districts
which are among those most promising at present
open

  at the present time all the land within fifteen
miles of the railroads is reserved by the canadian
government for returned soldiers from this coun-
try but there are good tracts of land outside this
belt which should be connected by rail before
long

  one man can take up a quarter-section of land
the entry fee for which is  the applicant must
declare his intention of becoming a british subject
as soon as he is qualified at the end of three
years a patent can be secured as long as the regula-
tions have been complied with which include the
residence for six months of each year on the home-
stead

  as far as the amount of money you would need
is concerned it would be rather hard for me to
make an estimate but many people manage to scrape
along on practically nothing however a little
capital is a great advantage

  the best time to come up to this country would
be may or june as prior to that everything is frozen
up for six months
