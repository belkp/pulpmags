and railroad mans magazine issued weekly a yfar april two new ideas which won millions of friends w hen the now famous brunswick was announced most people be- lieved that the utmost had already been attained in the phonographic art hence they expected and rightly so that
the brunswick would have to bring out
overwhelming betterments in order to win
a place among the leaders

  and this great expectation was realized
the brunswick created a memorable sen-
sation it commanded instant respect and
admiration

the pioneer

  of the major instrumentsthe brunswick
was the first to play all records with faith-
ful regard for different requirements this
feature alone created thousands of ad-
mirers for it meant that a brunswick
owner could buy and play any record
whatever make

  since different makes offer different ar-
tists and no one make offers them all
music lovers saw in the brunswick the

opportunity to select their own library of
records without restriction

  the other outstanding brunswick better-
ment was in tone production by a more
scientific amplification of tone waves the
brunswick overcame many old time crudi-
ties and brought out lovely tones hitherto
lost today the brunswick method of re-
production is a recognized triumph it
means perfected reproduction to all who
know it and the news is spreading fast

two famous ideas

  the brunswick method of reproduction includes
the ultona an all-record player this master in-
vention can be obtained on no other phonograph
the ultona presents to each make of record the
proper needle and diaphragm all at a turn of
the hand it is a unique reproducer not an attach-
ment nor makeshift

  the brunswick method also includes the bruns-
wick amplifier an all-wood sound chamber built
with scientific regard for acoustic laws no metal
is used because it muffles sound vibrations

  before you decide which phonograph for your
home hear the brunswick compare its tone
note the ultona a brunswick dealer will gladly
assist you in making a tone test

from  a week to 
a year in  hours

the story of two office men who needed
better salaries

  two fellow-employes one a bookeeper the
other a stenographer decided that s a week
was not in keeping with the high costs of jiv-
ing with such a salary there was little pros-
pect of giving their wives and kiddies any
pleasures outside of the movies street car
rides and summer outings in the parks

  they both decided that an income of at least
s a year was necessary and was not too
much to ask for their services-if they could
gkt it

  there was the rub kach of them had a dif-
ferent idea as to how he was going to put it
over on this one point they were at wide
disagreement kach was so convinced that
his way was right a wager w as entered into
between them as to who would be first to land
a job at  a year or better

  mr bookkeepers plan was to put up a bold
front to bluff his way into an important
job-he was going to get there on hisnerve
he positively knew men who were less cap-
able than he and they got into good jobs he
claimed by pure nerve backed up by a little
luck he was going to watch the want ads
and apply for every attractive position so long
as he thought there was the slightest chance
of landing one of them he scanned the news-
papers day after day after some several
hundred attempts and aided by the fact that
the war had made men scarce he finally se-
cured a position at  a year but was tired
and kicked out lor incompetency after a
weeks trial

  he had actually put in an average ol two
hours a day over a period of a year and a half
reading the help wanted columns of the
daily papers writing letters of application
telephoning scheming dreaming and hoping
in uot one case in twenty did he even get an
interview all his efforts were for noth ing
nothing but another twenty-five dollar salary
he finished exactly where he started after
wasting a good part of a year and a half hunt-
ing jobs he was unqualified to fill

  now mr stenographer had a different
scheme-one that was practical and thorough-
ly tested it worked out even better than he
had planned he put it over in a big way
in exactly  hours-spare time too they
were thrift hours he said which can be
saved out of the time men ordinarily waste
in any  days of the year

  mr stenographer too went over the help
wantedcolumns of the newspapers he was
attracted by the large number of really big
positions open to competent men he noted
particularly the unusual salaries-any num-
ber of them at  to sc a year offered
to expert accountants auditors cost ac-
countants comptrollers senior and junior
accountants

  why this big demand for trained account-
ants he asked himself

  that night he read a book the awaken-
ing of business by mr edward n hurley
when mr hurley wrote this book he was
chairman of the federal trade commission
he claims that not one in ten american busi-
ness men keep accurate accounting systems
they dont know their costs they are losing
money when they think they are making a
profit he said in effect that american busi-
ness men have got to wake up if they are
going to be factors in the competition for
world trade

  and american business is waking up

  that is one reason why expert account-
ants are in such great and growing demand
mr stenographer at once pictured that bigger
income for himself as a trained accountant
that night in another section of the evening
paper he read an advertisement of an institu-
tion offering to train ambitious men in the
principles of higher accountancy under the
direction of a certified public accountant as-
sisted by a big staff of accounting and busi-
ness experts that institution was the lasalle
extension university-the largest institution
of the kind in the world whose graduates are
in demand in every organization where efli-
cient well trained men are needed

  before mr stenographer went to bed that
night he dropped into the mails an inquiry to
the university asking for full particulars re-
garding their home study course and servica
in higher accountancy

  the very next day he heard a big employer
say

     the most efficient and most rapidly
  promoted men in our whole organiza-
  tion are lasalle trained

  within  hours of only spare time effort
given to lasalle training from the time he
read the advertisement he had made of him-
self an expert accountant with an income a
little better than  a year he had in-
creased his salary  and had accom-
plished in  hours what his bookkeeping
friend failed to do in a year and a half

  lasalle trained men can be found in the
administrative and executive departments
of practically every large business firm
corporation and railroad in america

  large and quick salary advances come so
regularly to lasalle men that there simply is
no doubt about the profits to be made from
this training a lasalle member writes of
 per cent increase one reports  per cent
another tells of  per cent another writes
that he has become an official of his company
and still another has had four raises and is
eligible to a quarterly bonus these and
thousands of other instances of promotion
won through this spare time training under
lasalle experts show how any man can
literally push himself ahead in business

  lasalle training is the shortest cut to an
executive accountancy position ever made
available to ambitious business employes
to those who have had no bookkeeping ex-
perience it provides thoro instruction in ele-
mentary accounting principles it enables

the recluse

steele weir cast a measuring glance
at the pile of chopped wood then wiped
the-fine dew of perspiration from his
brow sank the ax-blade into the chopping-
log and seated himself upon a sawn block
a grim smile shaped itself upon his lips

  though he never chopped wood now ex-
cept on these rare visits to his recluse fa-
thers cabin here on the forested mountain-
side his tall lean figure was as tough and
wiry as ever his arm as tireless his eye as
true to cut the exact line there was yet
no softening of his fibers nor any fat on his
ribs and there would be neither if he had
anything to say about it

  from the little idaho town in the valley
below which he viewed through the clear-
ing before the cabin his gaze came around
to his father seated on the door-step taci-
turn and brooding the latter had always
been but a poignant pity and sorrow
struck at the sons heart as he perceived
what a mere shell of a man now sat there

gray-haired bent fleshless consumed body
and soul by the destroying acid of some
dark secret

  even when a lad steele weir had sensed
the mystery clouding his fathers life like
an evil spell it had condemned them to sol-
itude here in the mountains until steeles
youth at last rebelled and he had departed
hungry for schooling for human society
and for a wider field of action

  what that secret might be he had for
years not allowed himself to speculate
unbidden at times the memory of certain
revealing looks or acts of his fathers float-
ed into hisjnind a dread if not terror
that oh occasion dilated the elder mans
eyes and a steadfast driving of himself at
work as if to obliterate painful and de-
spairing thoughts and an uneasy furtive
vigilance when forced to visit town

  once when a stranger-a short heavy-
set bearded man-had unexpectedly ap-
peared at the door his father had leaped
for the revolver hanging in its holster on
the wall

  on catching a second view of the chance

	argosy

visitor he had exclaimed  not burk-
hardt after all  with which he burst into
a wild laugh the shrill mirthless laugh of
a man suddenly freed of a terrible fear
however as he returned the gun-belt to its
place his hand shook so that he pawed all
around the nail on which it was accustomed
to hang

  steele weir would never forget that mo-
ment of panic his fathers spring to the
wall and following laugh-the only laugh
he had heard from those lips and though
but twelve years old at the time he could
not misread the episode

  on another occasion he found his father
kneeling at the grave under the giant pine
beyond the cabin-the graveof the gentle
mother of whom steele had but dim recol-
lections- and his fathers hands were
clasped his head bowed

  with an infinite yearning he had longed
to creep forward and comfort him by his
presence by a clasp of the hand but the
recollection of his fathers habitual chill re-
serve daunted him and he stole away

  on his own life the mystery had left its
gloomy impress a solitary and joyless
boyhood overhung by he knew not what
danger haunted by a parents lurking fear
and anguish had made him a silent cold
ever-watchful man never entirely free from
the expectation that his fathers sealed past
at some instant would open and confront
him with terrible facts

  for that reason at thirty-five he had
never married for that reason he felt
that the success he had made as an engi-
neer a success won by relentless toil and
solid ability rested on a quicksand for
that cause he had welcomed and executed
with a cool grim indifference to risk engi-
neering commissions of extreme hazard on
which account he was known in the profes-
sion as  cold steel  weir

  who first had bestowed upon steele weir
that sobriquet was not known but it was
not misapplied cold steel he had proved
himself a dozen times in critical moments
when other men would have broken - in
pushing bridges over mountain chasms in
averting threatening mine disasters in al-
most hopeless fights against bandits in
mexico and yet though admirers he had

by scores he possessed no friends no inti-
mates and as a man was still as solitary
of soul as when a boy here at this lonely
cabin

  once again he put the question he al-
ways asked on his visits and with no more
hope of a consenting reply than before

   i must be going to-morrow wont
you come along with me this time father
i want you to live with me so that i can
look after you and be with you we can
fix up a good cabin at the engineering
camp youre not so strong as you were
you could fall sick here and die and never
a person know it i doubt if you spend
in making yourself comfortable one dollar
in ten of the money i send you you
would be interested in the work of this big
irrigation project im to build

  his father appeared to shudder

   no no he muttered  ive lived
here and ill die here

   thats what im afraid of steele re-
sponded  afraid you may become sick
and die for lack of care

   no ill remain my son

  that was conclusive it was the answer
of not only thirty years of living at the
spot but of his secret dread steele saw
once more the stark fear in his eyes the
fear of contact with men of venturing out
into the world of precipitating fate

  for a time his father plucked his white
unkempt beard with unsteady hand

   wheres the place youre going this
time he presently inquired without real
interest

   new mexico

  on the elders face appeared suddenly a
gray shadow as if the blood were ebbing
from his heart

   where in new mexico he whispered
   the town of san mateo

  his father struggled to his feet with
one hand he clutched the door-frame for
support the skin of his cheeks had gone
a sickly white

  san mateo-san mateo he gasped
 not there not there steele keep away
keep away keep away my god not san
mateo-you

  he swayed as if about to fall full length
gesturing blindly before his face as if to
cold steel



 sweep away the thought while his son ran
 toward him	

     father youre sick steele exclaimed
 putting an arm about the other and in
 truth the elder man seemed fainting ready
 to collapse  come let me help you in
 so you can lie down i must bring a doc-
 tor

   steele almost carried him to the bed
 on it his father sank remaining with closed
 eyes and scarcely breathing

     no doctor bring no doctor he said
 painfully at last  i feel-i feel as if-
 dying

    i must bring a doctor and i have a
 flask of whisky let me pour you a little
 to revive your heart

    the change the words wrought from pas-
 sivity to action was starting the elder
 weir arose suddenly on elbow glaring
 fiercely

     whisky never it brought me to this
 -it damned my life if it had not been
 for whisky- without finishing the words
 he fell back on the bed

    the loathing the hatred the utter hor-
 ror of his exclamation banished from his
 sons mind further thought of using this
 stimulant

     but the doctor he inquired gently

     no use steele ive been the same as
 a dead man for days just ashes i want
 to die i want to lie by your mother there
 under the big pine and maybe ill have
 peace-peace

    steele took in his own the wasted hand
 hanging from the bed he held it tight
 with a feeling of infinite tragedy

     youll be yourself again soon he said
comfortingly though without faith in the
 assurance

    his fathers lips moved in a whisper

     no my time is here at last said he
  but dont go to san mateo steele-dont
 go dont go oh spare me that

    would- you have me break my word
  never have to any man father i ac-
 cepted this offer and signed a contract im
 morally bound these men are depending on
 me were you ever at san mateo was
 it something that happened there that
 makes you fearful to have me go san
 mateo is a thousand miles from here

  the face before him became like the face
of a corpse for an instant steeles heart
went cold in the belief that his father had
died under the effect of his declaration but
at last the eyelids raised the eyes gazed
at him and all at once the features of the
harsh visage seemed softened changed
lightened by a dim illumination

   i see you now as you are a man
stronger than i ever was he murmured
 i lived in fear but my fear was not for
myself had i been alone nothing would
have mattered after your mother died but
my fear was for you-and of you i was
afraid your life would be blasted i was
in terror lest you should hate and despise
me when you learned the truth so 
sought to conceal it

   you had no need to fear that

   i see it now tell me everything or
nothing as you wish about your going to
san mateo to work it will frighten me no
longer

  steele briefly spoke of his new work
there of the magnitude of the project and
the desire he had had that his father might
be with him

   im proud of you his father said
 god knows i have not been the parent i
would or should have been to you

   its enough for me if your hearts easy
now

   i feel as if i were gaining peace at
last and-and i must speak in san mateo
-ah steele you may hear of me-you
may have to fight the damning influence
of my name and past but i kmnv now
youll come through it and all i pray for
is that you can retain a little love for me
despite everything

   whatever it is i shjll hear of my fa-
ther i should rather hear it from his lips
than from strangers

  the hand in his closed spasmodically
for a long time nothing was said and the
only sound in the room was the ticking of
the tin clock on the shelf busily measuring
off the seconds of the old mans failing
span to steele it was as if his father
were slowly summoning the few remaining
shreds of his fortitude to reveal the cancer
of his past

   im a branded murderer he gasped


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   you never killed a man from a mere
desire to slay steele responded firmly
 i too have killed men in fights in mex-
ico the fact doesnt weight my mind

    in the line of your duty in the line of
your duty but i was drunk he was a
friend when i became sober i saw him
with a bullet-hole in his head

   do you remember nothing of shooting
him

   nothing nothing

   how do you know you killed him
his son demanded with inexorable logic
 what is the proof

  a low groan escaped his father

   men said i had killed him but my
own mind was blank

   who were the men were they pres-
ent at the time

   they were four - sorenson vorse
gordon burkhardt

   were you arrested and tried

   no they helped me to escape be-
cause of your mother they said and be-
cause they said they were my friends but
i never felt they were really friends for
they were always against newcomers and
wanted to keep things in their own hands
you were only three or four years old at
that time steele so you wouldnt remem-
ber anything about matters there

   what were you doing at san mateo
father

  now that the hideous past at last stood
uncovered the son was able to turn upon
it his incisive mind he would drag out and
scrutinize every bone of the skeleton
which had terrorized his father and shad-
owed his own life

  facts faced are never so dreadful as
fears unmaterialized and more he sought
with all the love of a son for circumstances
that would mitigate excuse or even justify
his fathers act

   i was ranching was the low answer
 i had come to san mateo two years be-
fore from the east bringing you and your
mother and considerable money i bought
a ranch and stocked it with cattle i was
doing well in spite of the fact that i was
new to the country and the business also
i was making friends and i had been nomi-
nated for the legislature of the territory

to run against gordon but i had taken
to drinking with the men i met - other
cattlemen-because i fancied no harm in
it and then while in a drunken stupor
i killed jim dent

   had you quarreled with him

   never never-till that moment i killed
jim they said i quarreled with him then
but i remember nothing jim was my best
friend i would have trusted him with my
life even now i cant make it seem real
i shot him though it must be true with
those four witnesses

   what of your ranch your political
nomination

   i withdrew from the latter that was
one of the terms made by gordon on which
they were to help me escape instead of
turning me over for prosecution and my
rnch and cattle-i had to deed them over
to the four men too

   then their friendship wasnt disinter-
ested steele said quickly with suspicion
dawning on his face

  thev werent really friends-i knew
that

   how were they to arrange your es-
cape

  the senior weir seemed to shudder at
the question

   by bribing the sheriff and county at-
torney i was then to leave the country at
once never showing my face again or i
should be arrested i was still half dazed
by whisky and terror i took your mother
and you and fled this far when my money
gave out so here ive remained ever since
for here i could hide and here was her
grave

  the look on the sons countenance was
grim

   whats the last thing you remember of
the circumstance previous to learning dent
was dead he asked

   ah though i had been drinking i can
remember clearly up to the time i stopped
playing poker with jim and the four men
for we were losing and i felt they were
working a crooked deal on us somehow i
asked jim to quit also for though i hadnt
lost much he was losing fast and playing
recklessly but he wouldnt drop out of
the game and when vorse and sorenson
cold steel



cursed me and told me to mind my own
business i went back to a table near the
rear door and laid my head on my arms
and went to sleep

   when i was awake again vorse and
gordon was holding me up by their table
and jim was dead on the floor  had
come forward they said begun a big row
with dent and finally shot him

   then the only witnesses were these
four men who were gambling with him who
cursed you when you attempted to persuade
him to drop his cards steele proceeded
 one of whom was your political adver-
sary- men who were old-timers and op-
posed to newcomers who pretended to be
your friends but took your ranch and
cattle it begins to look to me as if they
not only killed your friend dent but
double-crossed you into the bargain did
you look in your gun afterward

   no i was sick with horror of the
accusation i tell you steele  had no
way to deny it it seemed indeed as if 
must have killed him and from that day
until this ive never had the courage of
soul to reload my pistol or even clean it
it hangs there on the wall with the very
shells - two empty the rest unfired - it
carried that day in san mateo

  the son sprang up and crossed to the
nail where hung the weapon the latter
he drew from the holster and broke open
so that the cartridges were ejected into his
hand for an instant he stared at them
but at length walked to the bed before
which he extended his palm	

  look-look for yourself he exclaimed
hoarsely you never killed jim dent
drunk or sober youd never kill any one
youre not a murderer youre the inno-
cent victim of those four infamous scoun-
drels they deceived you they ruined your
life and their damnable fraud not only
killed my mother in her youth as i guess
by grief and despair but has brought you
now to your death too

  his father had raised himself on an arm
to gaze incredulously at the six unfired car-
tridges lying in his sons palm then all
at oijce -his bearded lips trembled and a
great iigljt of joy flashed upon his face

   innocent - innocent  he whispered

steele my son - helen my wife xo
stain on my soul

  as he sank back steeles arms caught
him he did not speak again but his eyes
rested radiantly on his boys before they
glazed in death

  weir gently lowered his fathers form
upon the bed covered it with a blanket
then he walked to the door and gazed
forth upon the sunlit valley for him and
for his father also the black curtain of the
past had been rent in twain in the twinkling
of an eye but revelations are not to be
calculated by units of time

  some obscure process of mind more pro-
found and more sure than mere intuition
had prompted him to delve into the mys-
tery and had established the truth in his
fathers case he was as certain of his
fathers innocence as that the sun stood in
the sky nothing now would ever shake
that faith

  he felt no sorrow no grief indeed his
spirit was lighter than it had ever been
hitherto peace and happiness had filled
his father at the final minute of his life
he had died with the knowledge that his
hands were not red with the blood of mur-
der in that there was cause for gladness

  but what of his fathers thirty years of
undeserved torment what of his ruined
life steele weirs gray eyes narrowed
until they held but glints like knife-points
his bronzed features became as hard as the
mountains granite the names of the men
responsible for the hellish business were
seared in hisurain and never a mild man
there were slowly distilled in his soul at
this moment a deadly haired and an im-
placable purpose if yet alive they should
pay the penalty

   theyll beg to be put over a slow fire
and end it before ive finished with them
he grated between his teeth

chapter ii

in a hostile country

castward out of the torquilla range
the burntwood river emerged from a
gorge flowing swift and turbulent during
the spring months shallow and murmurous


argosy and railroad mans magazine

the rest of the year to pass through a basin
formed by low mountains and break forth
at last through a canon and wind away over
the mesa in the canon was being erected
the huge reservoir dam which was to store
water for irrigating in the future the broad
acres spreading from its base

  a beginning had already been made but
the engineer in charge had met with delays
local opposition and labor difficulties until
the directors of the company determined to
replace him by a man capable of driving
the work over all obstacles

  steele weir had finally been engaged as
the best for the task after his father
had been laid away in a grave under the
pine above the cabin he had traveled with-
out pause to new mexico for a week he
had consulted with the retiring engineer
studied maps and blue-prints examined
the work finished analyzed the general sit-
uation and then taken over the project

  what had been accomplished had been
done well enough he had no criticism to
make on that score but he perceived that
magney his predecessor had been drag-
ging at the work had been checked and
defeated in a dozen ways and indeed was
only too pleased to escape from a difficult
situation

  when magney had whirled away in an
automobile for the nearest railway point-
bowenville thirty-five miles away-weir
strode to the dam site where he located
the superintendent directing the pouring of
concrete in the frames of the dam core

  atkinson was a man of fifty with a
stubby gray mustache a brown wind-
bitten face and a tall angular figure as
weir joined him he was observing the in-
dolent movements of a group of mexican
laborers with a speculative eye

   theyre not breaking any records are
they steele remarked

   i ought to land on them with an ax-
handle and put the fear of god into their
hearts was the bitter reply

   well why not

   why not atkinson swung about
and stared at the other  theyd quit to
a man if made to do a mans work i sup-
posed magney had told you that a dozen
times ive been ready to throw up my job

im ashamed to boss work where the men
can loaf and i must keep my tongue still
 from now on they work or get out of
the camp

   what about that  company policy 
magney was always talking about of hiring
nothing but local labor to keep the com-
munity friendly the superintendent ex-
claimed grinning  that made him sorer
than everything else said the directors
had tied his hands by promising no work-
men should be imported if they did and
i guess they did all right they sure bun-
coed themselves keep the people here
friendly huh  he concluded scornfully

   they havent been that then weir
asked with a slight smile

   does it look like it when the workmen
wont work enough to earn their salt
they openly boast that we dare neither
make them work nor fire them they say
sorenson and his bunch will pull every man
off the works if we lift a finger and they
all know about that fool promise of the
directors friendly just about as friend-
ly as a bunch of wildcats

   this whole section white men and
mexicans are putting a knife into this proj-
ect whenever they can do you think they
want all that mesa fenced up and farmed
this is a range country they propose to
keep it range they dont want any more
people coming here-farmers storekeepers
and white people generally

   thats always the case in a range coun-
try before its opened up weir said  but
they have to swallow the pill

   let me tell you something they dont
intend to swallow it here they figure on
keeping this county just as it is for only
themselves and their cattle and woollies
and everybody else keep out the few big
sheep and cattle men white and mex have
their minds made up to that and theyre
the only ones who count all the rest are
poor mexicans with nothing but fleas chil-
dren goats and votes to keep sorenson
and his gang in control

   theyve set out to bust this company
or tire it out till it throws up the sponge
theyve spiked magney and theyll try to
spike you next and every manager who
comes thats plain talk im giving you
cold steel



mr weir but its fact and if it doesnt
sound nice to your ears you can have my
resignation any minute

   ive been hoping to hear it from now-
on drive this crowd of coffee-colored loaf-
ers put the lash on their backs

  a gleam of unholy joy shone in atkin-
sons eyes as he heard weirs words

  all right that goes he said but
im warning you that theyll quit youll
see em stringing out of camp for home to-
night and those who hang out till to-mor-
row will leave then for sure by to-mor-
row night the dam will be as quiet as a
church week-days theyll not show up
again either until you send word for them
to come back-and then theyll know
youve surrendered magney tried it once
-just once and thats why you found
me chewing tobacco so lamblike and saying
nothing

   turn your gat loose weir said and
turning on his heel he went back to head-
quarters

  before atkinson fired a volley at the
unsuspecting workmen he crossed the canon
to where a cub engineer was peering through
a transit the superintendent had over-
heard a scrap of gossip among the staff one
evening before weirs arrival when they
where discussing the advent of the new
chief

   what was that name you fellows were
saying weir was called by he asked the
youngster

  the boy straightened up

    cold steel - cold steel  weir any-
way thats what ferguson says was the
answer  i never heard it before myself
his first names steele you know and he
looks cold enough to be ice when hes ask-
ing questions about things boring into a
fellow with his eyes but hes up against
a hard game here

   maybe but a man doesnt get a name
like that for just parting his hair nice
atkinson remarked  he told me to stretch
em -a horny thumb jerked toward the
workmen- and youll see some real work
hereabout for the rest of the afternoon

   and to-morrow will be sunday three
days ahead of time

   sure

   what then

   you know as much about that as i do
make your own guess with which the
speaker started off

  the morrow was  sunday  with a
vengeance the majority of the laborers
demanded their pay-checks the minute
work ceased at the end of the afternoon
atkinson tightened cyders and by noon
next day the last of the mexicans had quit
the fires in the stationary engines were
banked the concrete mixers did not re-
volve the conveyers were still the dam
site wore an air of abandonment in head-
quarters the engineers worked over tracings
or notes and in the commissary store the
half-dozen white foremen gathered to smoke
and yarn that was the extent of the ac-
tivity

  two days passed after dinner weir
held a terse lon-distance telephone con-
versation the only incident of the second
day and it was overheard byno one on
the fourth day this was repeated at dawn
of the fifth he despatched all of the fore-
men enginemen and engineers with wag-
ons to bowenville and about the middle
of the afternoon accompanied by his assis-
tant meyers and atkinson he sped in the
managers car down the river for san
mateo two miles below the camp

  of the town steele weir had had but a
glimpse as he hashed through on his way
to the dam the morning of his arrival
twelve days earlier it had but a single
main street from which littered side streets
and alleys ran off between mud houses

  the county court-house sat among cot-
tonwood trees in an open space a few pre-
tentious dwellings homes of the few white
men and the well-to-do mexicans arose
among long low adobe structures that were
as brown and characterless as the sun-dried
bricks of which they were built

  that was san mateo to-day that with
the exception of here and there a sloping
wooden roof was the fateful mexican san
mateo of his fathers tragedy and every
man of those guilty of the crime of blasting
the elder weirs life was yet alive that
much steele had speedily ascertained yet
alive as if destiny had preserved them for
his hands

  he anticipated that they would have no
suspicion of his true identity weir was
not an uncommon name for them his
father had vanished thirty years ago and
men who could deliberately execute so in-
famous a plot as these had done would be
men of nerve little likely to be disturbed
by fantoms when however they had be-
held him and perceived a resemblance in
face as well as in name to their victim he
imagined they would not be so easy in
mind

  before doors and everywhere along the
street workmen from the dam were idling
as meyers brought the automobile to a
stop before the court-house news of weirs
visit appeared to spread miraculously and
mexicans began to saunter forward to hear
what they expected a suave invitation to
return to work the three americans in
the car sat quietly while they gathered

  weir stood up

   who can speak for these men he
demanded

  a lean mexican with a shiny black mus-
tache and a thin neck protruding from a
soiled linen collar pushed forward

   i am authorized to speak for them he
announced disclosing his teeth in a smile

   are you one of the workmen

   im a lawyer and represent them you
have come to persuade them to resume
work there are conditions to be agreed
to before they will return first no driv-
ing of them by superintendent or foreman
second full wages for these days you have
forced them to remain idle

   i not the workmen make the condi-
tions for work on this job weir stated
in reply there will be no back pay
they can return to work only  on the un-
derstanding that they work as directed
and they must start for the dam within
an hour or not at all

  preposterous the spokesman ex-
claimed angrily

  swinging about he rapidly translated
into spanish weirs statement at which
jeers and curses broke forth

   you see the lawyer addressed weir
spreading his hand in an exaggerated ges-
ture and lifting his brows

   ask them if they definitely refuse to

return to work on the terms ive stated
and at once the engineer said

  the lawyer put the question to the
crowd a chorus of howls from the three
hundred throats came in answer the re-
fusal was disdainful immediate and unani-
mous

   well now discuss the mens terms
the lawyer stated urbanely

   no the matter is settled they wpi
not be hired again start the car meyers

  the roar of the engine swallowed the
protests of the indignant mexican lawyer
the crowd in stupefaction at this abrupt
ending of the conference divided and the
automobile moved ahead

   drive to vorses saloon i want a look
at the man was the engineers next direc-
tion

  into the place weir and his companions
entered an anemic-appearing mexican
youth at the far end of the bar started for-
ward to serve them but a bald - headed
hawk-nosed man seated at a desk behind
the cigar-case laid aside his newspaper
arose and checked the other by a sidewise
jerk of his head

  he received their orders for beer and
lifted three dripping bottles from a tub of
water at his feet his eyes passed casu-
ally over steele weirs face glanced away
then came back for a swift unblinking
scrutiny

  the eyes his own met were as hard
stony and inscrutable as his own finally
vorse turned his gaze toward the window
and extracting a quill toothpick from a
vest-pocket began thoughtfully to pick his
teeth

   youre the new manager at the dam
he asked presently still considering the
street through the window

   i am

   and your name is weir

    youve got it right

  the questions ended there the three
men from camp slowly consumed their beer
and exchanged indifferent remarks at the
end of five minutes the mexican lawyer
clutching the arm of an elderly gray-mus-
tached man entered the saloon

  they lined up at the bar near the
others the older of the pair regarded the
cold steel



trio shrewdly and ordered  a little bour-
bon when he had swallowed this he
addressed the men from the engineering
camp

   which of you is mr weir

   i am he steele replied

   mr martinez here has solicited me
mr weir to use my offices in explaining
to you the workmens point of view in the
controversy that exists relative to work
im senator gordon and i have no interest
in the matter except to see an amicable and
just arrangement effected

   theres no longer any controversy
weir said  the men stopped work re-
fused to go back again and that closes the
matter

   my dear sir let us talk it over and
the other bringing forth a pair of spec-
tacles set bow upon nose

   i gave them their chance and theyll
not have another theyve browbeaten this
company long enough i expected them to
refuse so made preparations accordingly
a hundred and fifty white workmen ar-
rived at bowenville from denver this morn-
ing and are on their way here now a
hundred and fifty more will come to-mor-
row the case is closed as you would say
mr gordon

  the others blue-veined hand shut in a
sudden grip his lips framed a snarl

   the case isnt closed we have the
directors promise that no outside labor
shall be brought in here

   it will be here to-night

   youll repent it youll repent it he
seized the whisky-bottle and poured him-
self a second drink  as sure as your
names weir which im told it is

  steele stepped nearer him

   thats my name did you ever hear
it before

  the look on his face became grim and
menacing his eyes held the older mans
in savage lease atkinson and meyers and
even the volatile mexican lawyer marti-
nez remained unmoving sensing in the sit-
uation some deep current of unknown
forces of which they were ignorant

   you are the son of- gordon at last
muttered staring at steele weirs features
with fascinated gaze

   i am

   and-and-

   and i know what happened thirty
years ago in this selfsame room

  the whisky in the glass that the other
still held ready to drink suddenly slopped
over his fingers the mans figure appeared
to become more bent without a word he
set glass on the bar and went out the door

  weir turned his gaze on vorse the lat-
ters right hand was under the bar and he
seemed to be awaiting the engineers next
move tight-lipped taut watchful

  that was for you too vorse weir
flung at him

  and he led his companions out into the
street

chapter iii

  a comedy-and something else

toward noon one day a week later
steele weir headed for bowenville in
his car had gained chico creek half-way
between camp and san mateo when he
perceived that another machine blocked the
ford about the wheels of the stalled car
the shallow water rippled briskly four or
five inches deep entirely deep enough by
all appearance to keep marooned in the
runabout the girl sitting disconsolately at
the wheel

  she was a very attractive looking girl
steele noted casually as he brought his own
car to a halt sprang out and went to join
her wading the water with his laced boots
as he approached he perceived that she
had a slender well-rounded figure fine-
spun brown hair under her hat-brim clear
brown eyes and the pink of peach-blossoms
in her soft smooth cheeks

  but her look of relief vanished when she
distinguished his face and her shoulders
squared themselves

   has your engine stopped he asked

  yes

    ill look into the hood

   i prefer that you would not

  for an instant surprise marked his coun-
tenance

   you mean that you desire to remain
here he asked
	argosy and railroad mans magazine

   i dont wijjfi to remain here but i
choose that in preference to your aid

  the man who had bent forward to lift
one cover of the engine straightened up at
that he considered her intently and in
silence for a time marking her heightened
color the haughty poise of her head the
firm set of her lips

   to my knowledge i never saw you be-
fore in my life he remarked at last
 what may i ask is your particular rea-
son for declining my services

  she was dumb for a little while she
tucked back a stray tendril of hair the
act was performed with the left hand and
weirs eyes which seldom missed anything
observed a diamond flash on the third finger

   well id also choose not to speak
said she afterward  but if you insist-

   i dont insist i merely request-your
highness

  a flash of anger shot from her eyes at this
irony

  dont think im afraid to tell you
she cried  its because youre the man-
ager of the construction camp and if youve
never seen me before ive at least had you
pointed out to me i wish no assistance
from the man who turns off his poor work-
men without excuse or warning and brings
want and trouble upon the community it
was like striking them in the face and
then you break your promise not to bring
in other workmen

  as she had said she did not lack cour-
age her words gushed forth in a torrent
as if an expression of pent-up and outraged
lustice disclosing a fervent sympathy and
a fine zeal-and likewise a fine ignorance
of the facts

   well why dont you say something
she added when he gave no indication of
replying

  steele could have smiled at this feminine
view of the matter that violent assertions
required affirmations or denials

   what am i supposed to say he asked

  apparently that exhausted her patience

   youll please molest me no longer she
stated icily

   very well

  he raised the hood and inspected the en-
gine during his attempts to start it she

sat nonchalantly humming an air and gazing
at the mountains as if her mind were a thou-
sand miles away-which it was not

   something wrong it will have to be
hauled in said he finally

  no reply steele returned to his own
car and driving into the creek-bed worked
his way around her when he was on the
far bank he rejoined her again carrying
a coil of rope one end of this he fastened
securely to the rear axle of her runabout

  what are you going to do sir she
demanded whirling about on her seat and
glaring angrily

   drag you out

   youll do nothing of the kind

   oh yes was his calm response

   against my wishes sir

   certainly

   this is abominable

   perhaps

   ill put on the brakes and put them
on she did with a savage jerk

  but nevertheless weirs powerful ma-
chine drew jier car slowly up out of the
creek upon the road where he forced it
about until it pointed toward san mateo
then he retied the rope on the front axle

   now for town said he

   why did you haul me out of there 
demand to know

   why because you were a public ob-
struction blocking traffic if you had re-
mained there long enough you would have
become a public nuisance and its the duty
of every citizen to abate nuisances no one
would call you a nuisance of course-not to
your face at any rate but travelers might
have felt some annoyance if compelled to
drive around you they might even have had
you arrested when they learned you were
acting out of wilful stubbornness

  in a sort of incredulous wonder of
charmed horror the girl heard herself thus
unfeelingly described

   you-you barbarian she cried

   ready were off for town now

   ill run my car in the ditch and wreck
it if you so much as pull it another inch
 i dont like to be frustrated in my gen-
erous acts they are so few according to
common report well well leave the car
but it must be drawn off the road
cold steel



  when this was accomplished weir re
placed the rope in his machine then he
returned to her

   what now do you intend to sit here
in the hot sunshine to say nothing of miss-
ing your dinner

   that doesnt concern you

  weir shook his head gravely

   you must be saved from your own
folly said he

  before she hadrealized what was hap-
pening he had opened the door of the
runabout swung her out upon the ground
and was marching her toward his own ma-
chine stupefaction at this quick atro-
cious deed left her an automaton and
before she had fully regained her control
they were speeding toward san mateo she
at his side

   this is outrageous  she gasped

  steele weir did not speak until they
entered town

   where is your home he asked

   turn to the right at the end of the
street

  it was before a house of modern struc-
ture banked with a bewildering number of
flowers and shaded by trees that he halted
the car he alighted bared his head as-
sisted her to descend bowed and then with-
out a word drove away leaving her to stare
after him with a baffling mixture of feelings
and the single indignant statement  and
he didnt even wait long enough for me to
thank him

  nor did her perplexity lessen when her
car was left before the door during the after-
noon by one of the camp mechanics to
whom weir had telephoned from san
mateo and who had put it in running
order

  weir himself proceeded to bowenville
where matters regarding shipments and the
unloading of machinery engaged him the
rest of the day into his mind however
there floated at moments the image of the
girls face banish it as he would

  he had learned her name by asking who
was the owner of the house where she had
alighted information necessary to direct the
mechanic as to the delivery of the stalled
car

  hosmer it was and the residence was

that of dr hosmer presumably she was
his daughter and what a vivid charming
never-surrender enemy lucky the chap
who had won this high-spirited girl

  his own past in relation to the other
sex had been starred by no love affair or
even episodes of a sentimental nature the
character of his work had kept him for long
periods away from womens society but
further than this there had been the shadow
on his life which he recognized with a high
sense of honor laid upon him an obliga-
tion to carry it alone

   he felt himself bound to solicit no girls
affection or trust he considered himself
as unfree to seek friendships or favors and
in consequence he had pursued toward wo-
men a course of deliberate indifference that
with increasing years had unconsciously
made him more harsh more hard more
silent and aloof until at last he believed
no fair face could arouse in him an interest
or quicken his pulse

  but now the clouding shadow had been
dispelled indeed it had been but a false
shadow all the while he had the right
to breathe the air freely and mingle with
the world as he pleased long-stifled emo-
tions struggled in his breast sleeping de-
sires awoke his spirit swelled within the
shell of the years indurated habit then
these feelings would subside in a wave of
sardonic pessimism for his youth was gone
his nature was fixed and he would remain
hard and cold to the end of his days

  well let it be so it would serve him so
much the better against his enemies it
was this thought that occupied him as he
ate supper that evening in a restaurant in
bowenville and his course presently may
have been an involuntary revolt against
the fetters of fate his encounter and mild
clash with the girl at the ford had stirred
in him a strange restlessness a fierce pas-
sion to rip to pieces the pattern of gray
commonplace things and he welcomed the
chance that presented itself for action

  the restaurant was of an ordinary type
with a lunch-counter at one side a row of
tables down the middle and half a dozen
booths along the wall offering some degree
of privacy in one of these steele weir
was smoking a cigar and finishing his coffee


argosy and railroad mans magazine

before making his ride back to camp from
the booth adjoining he had been overhearing
for some time scraps of conversation when
the voices rose in protest and answering
explanation in perplexed appeal and earnest
assurance

   weirs own reflections finally ceased his
 head turned and remained fixed to listen
 while the cigar grew cold between his fin-
 gers for ten minutes or so his attitude of
 concentrated harkening to the two voices
 a girls and a mans remained unchanged
 little by little he was piecing out the thread
 of the confidential dialogue-and of the
 little drama being enacted in the booth

   his brows became lowering as he gathered
 its significance his lips drew together in a
 tight thin line he did not move when
 he heard the man push hack his chair to
 leave the place nor alter his position until
 there came the sound of the door closing
 at the front of the restaurant then he
 reached for his hat stood up and went
 lightly around into the other booth where
 he pulled the green calico curtain across the
 opening

   a girl of about seventeen of plump clean
 prettiness still sat at the table which was
 littered with dishes the cheap finery of
 her hat and dress showed a pathetic at-
 tempt to increase her natural comeliness
 at this minute her face showed amazement
 and a hint of apprehension

    what are you coming in here for
 she demanded

    i want to talk to you for a little while
 weir replied seating himself  you will
 please listen ive overheard enough of
 your talk to catch its drift you came here
 to get married but now this man wants
 to induce you to go to los angeles first

    that isnt any of your business the
 girl flashed back going white and red by
 turns

    im making it mine however you
 live up on terry creek by what i heard
 thats not far from my camp im the
 manager at the dam and my names weir

   at this statement the girl shrank back
 beginning to bite the hem of her handker-
 chief nervously and gazing at him with ter-
 rified eyes

    im here to help you not harm you

youve run away from home to-day to
marry this fellow did he promise to marry
you if you came down to bowenville

    yes

   and now he wants you to go with him
to los angeles first promising to marry
you there

   the girl hesitated with a wavering look
    yes

   he givfs you excuses of course but
they dont satisfy your mind do they
they dont satisfy mine at any rate its
the old trick supposing when you reached
the coast he didnt marry you after all
and put you off with more promises and
after a week or two abandoned you
oh he wouldnt do that she cried
with a gulp

   thats just what hes planning he
didnt meet you here until after dark i
judge youll both go to the train separate-
ly-i overheard that part afterward he
could return and deny that he had ever
had anything to do with you and it would
simply be your word against his and
which would people hereabouts believe tell
me that-which would they believe yours
or his after you had gone wrong

  the girl sat frozen then suddenly she
began to cry softly and with jerks of her
shoulders weir reached out and patted
her arm

   whats your name he asked

   mary-mary johnson

    mary im interfering in your affairs
only because i know what men will do
you must take no chances if this fellow
is really anxious to marry you hell do it
here in bowenville

   after a few sobs she wiped her eyes

    he said he didnt dare get the license
in san mateo or his folks would have
stopped our marriage

    then you could stay here to-night go
to the next county seat and be married to-
morrow his parents are bound to learn
about it once youre married a few days
more or less makes no difference and
though i should be back at my work ill
just stay over a day and take you there
in my car to-morrow to see that youre mar-
ried straight and proper why go clear to
los angeles
cold steel



   he said it would be our honeymoon-
and-and i had never been away from
here

   whats his name

  she hesitated in uncertainty whether or
not she should answer

   ed sorenson came at last from her
lips

  steele weir slowly thrust his head for-
ward fixing her with burning eyes

   son of the big cattleman he de-
manded

   yes sir

   and you love him

   yes oh yes

  weir sat back in his seat lighted a cigar-
ette and stared past her head at the opposite
partition the evil strain of the father had
been continued in the son and cited by
her physical freshness and the expectation
that she would be an easy prey was work-
ing here to seduce this simple ignorant girl

   well i doubt if he loves you he said
presently

   he does he does 

   if he really does above everything else
in the world hell be willing to marry you
openly no matter what his father may say
or do thats the test mary if hes in
earnest hell agree at once to go with us
to the next county seat to-morrow and be
married there by a minister isnt that
true answer me that squarely isnt it
true

   yes sir

   then by that well decide if he agrees
to it well and good if he refuses that
will show him up-show he never had any
intention of marrying you im a stranger
to you but im your friend and youre
not going to los angeles unmarried

  the last words were uttered in a level
menacing tone that caused mary johnson
to shiver to her reared in the humble
adobe house on her fathers little ranch on
terry creek a man who could manage the
great irrigation project seemed a figure out
of her ken a vast form working against
the sky his statements were not to be
disputed whatever she might think

   yes sir she said just above a whisper

   all right now well wait for him he
was coming back for you wasnt he

 yes i was to stay at the hotel till
train time

  is this your grip

 weir jerked a thumb toward a worn can-
 vas  telescope  fastened with a single
 shawl strap resting in the corner of the
 booth

  its mine yes sir

  how old is ed sorenson he asked
 after a pause

  about thirty maybe

  how old are you

  seventeen next month

  but sixteen yet this month

  yes sir

 he said nothing more as the minutes
 passed her timorous gaze continued stead-
 fastly on the stern graven image of the
 man she dully expected something terrible
 to happen when ed sorenson appeared for
 she knew ed would be angry but she had
 been powerless to prevent the intrusion of
 this terrible stranger

 fear in truth a fear that left her heart
 c  was her feeling as she contemplated
 him yet under that was there not some-
 thing else a sense of safety of com-
 forting assurance of protection

  you-you wont hurt ed if he wont
 go with us she asked in a low voice  if
 he gets mad and wont marry me here- i
 mean

 the mans eyes came round to hers

  ill just break him in two nothing more
 mary was the calm answer

chapter iv

the enemys spawn

 t he curtain to the booth was flung back

       ive the train tickets come along
 to the hotel- exclaimed the man who
 quickly entered but the words died in his
 mouth at sight of weir sitting in the place
 he had vacated

 he was over average height of strong
 fleshy build with a small blond mustache
 on his upper lip under his eyes little
 pouches had already begun to form his
 mouth was full and sensual but he still re-
 tained an air of liveliness of carelessness
 and agility that might at first sight seem


argosy and railroad mans magazine

 the spontaneity of youth he wore a brown
 suit a gray flannel shirt and stetson hat-
 the common apparel of the country

   who the devil are you and what
are you butting in here for he exclaimed
with a vicious spark showing in his pale-
blue eyes at the same time he clapped
a hand on weirs shoulder closing it in a
hard grasp

   instantly weir struck the hand off with
his fist

    keep your dirty flippers to yourself
he said rising

  the blood faded from the others coun-
tenance leaving it white with rage

   get out of this booth or ill throw
you out

   it was weirs turn to act like a flash
he caught sorensons elbow jerked him for-
ward spun him about and dropped him
upon the chair

    sit there you cradle-robber until im
through with you he commanded  and
 if you dont want everybody in this res-
taurant to know about your business with
this girl voull lower your voice when you
talk

  sorenson shot an uneasy glance toward
the curtain and his wrath became not less
furious but better controlled clearly pub-
lic attention was the last thing he desired
in this affair he leaned back staring at
steele weir insolently and produced a
cigarette at which he legan to puff

   mary get ready well be going in a
minute said he

    no youll not sorenson  ve taken a
hand in your game this girl says youre
going to marry her-is that right the
other rolled his eyes upward and began
to whistle a jig tune softly  well this
is the plan she and ive made shell re-
main at the hotel to-night-as will you and

i	-and to-morrow well drive to another
county-seat in my car and youll secure a
license there then youll go to a min-
isters where ill act as a witness and the
ceremony will be performed afterward the
pair of you can proceed to los angeles or
elsewhere as you please on your wedding
journey

    youre quite a little planner arent
you the other jeered

  	thats the arrangement if you agree
   i dont agree

mary johnson in whose eyes a light of
hope had dawned during weirs low-toned
statement began nervously to bite her lip

   wont you do it ed she asked
timidly

   well do as i planned or nothing he
stated then with sudden spite he con-
tinued youre responsible for this mix-
up what did you let this fellow in here
for while i was gone didnt you have
sense enough to keep your mouth shut
steele halted him by a gesture

   dont begin abusing her youre not
married to her yet i overheard your talk
and saw the low-lived scoundrelly trick
you proposed to play on her

   you damned eavesdropper-

   sure eavesdropper is right weir in-
terrupted coolly  so i just stepped in
here from my booth next door to discuss
the situation with her you cant mislead
an innocent girl like this with the intention
of shaking her when you get her into a
city not if i know about it and am around
if you sincerely intend to marry her and
will do so to-morrow in my presence then
ill withdraw afterward i mean of
course

  sorenson arose

   come mary then to weir  stand
aside you

   she doesnt go with you the engineer
stated

  for a moment the mens eyes locked-
those of one full of blue fire and hatred
those of the other quiet as pieces of flint

   and she shall go with me while i tele-
phone to your father that you brought her
here under promise of marriage a girl of six-
teen without her own parents consent and
that you now refuse to marry her steele
added

  a sneer twisted the other mans mouth

   my father happens to be in the east
where hes been for a month he mocked
 if he was here he wouldnt believe you
hed know you were a liar he knows im
engaged to marry-

  rite off the words as he tried they had
escaped

  ah thats the way of it weir re-
cold steel



marked with a silky smoothness  you
expect to marry some other girl-and have
no intention whatever of marrying mary
here

    to hell with you and your opinions 

    first you -coax her to bowenville with
a promise then you persuade her to go to
los angeles with more promises the en-
gineer proceeded steadily  and there you
would betray and abandon her to a life on
the streets like the yellow cur you are

   sorenson snapped his fingers and moved
round to the girls side

    pay no attention to him he addressed
her  hes only a crazy fool

   but she drew back against the wall star-
ing at him with a strained searching regard

   will you marry me to-morrow as he
says she asked anxiously

   no i explained the reason once
come on lets get away from him then
ill make everything clear and satisfactory
to you

   for a moment she stood wavering in in-
decision picking at her handkerchief her
face pale and unhappy questioning his
countenance finally she turned to look at
steele wreir standing silently by

  you never said you were engaged to
another girl you told me i was the only
one you loved she muttered in a choked
voice  but i see now you wont marry
me you wish me to go with you-but not
to marry me im going away-away any-
where by myself where ill never see
any one burying her face in her hands
she shook with sobs

    this is what comes from your putting
an oar in said sorenson lifting his fist
in a burst of fury to strike weir

   the latter at once smote him across the
mouth with open palm at the vile epithet
that followed sorenson staggered then
lunged forward tugging at something in his
hip-pocket while the table and dishes went
over in a crash

   before he could draw the weapon steeles
fingers shot forth and seized his wrist his
other hand closed about sorensons throat
in an iron grasp slowly under that power-
ful grip the younger mans struggles ceased
his eyes dilated his knees yielded and gave
way the revolver was wrenched from his

numbed hold his eyeballs seemed afire
his breast heaved in violent spasms for the
denied breath and his heart appeared about
to burst

    you miserable skunk  weir said bare-
ly moving his mouth  i ought to choke
the life out of you then he released his
hold  ill keep this gun-and use it if
you ever try to pull another on me now
make tracks remember too to pay your
bill as you go out

  when sorenson had straightened his coat
giving weir a malignant look during the
process he departed his air of disdainful
insolence had quite evaporated but that he
considered the action between them only
begun was plain though he spoke not a
word weir however heard him give a
quieting explanation to the waiter hovering
outside who had been drawn by the crash
of dishes

   thought a fight was going on the
aproned dispenser of food said to steele
when he and the girl emerged

   just an accident nothing broken i
imagine was the response

   you cant break those dishes with a
hammer theyre made for rough work

  if theres any damage this may cover
it and steele tossed him a dollar

   outside the restaurant he slipped his hand
into mary johnsons arm and led her along
the street with him he had brought the
old strapped grip

   where you taking me she asked in a
worried quaver

   home mary

    oh im afraid to go home

   are you afraid of your own father and
mother theyre the ones to trust first of
all

   but when father-mother is dead-sees
the telescope hell want to know where ive
tfeen he doesnt know i have it i told
him i might stay with a girl at san mateo
overnight and then sneaked it out

    the best thing is to tell him all about
it

    oh i cant

   then i shall leave that part to me

   and though her heart was filled with fresh
alarms and fears at the prospect there
seemed nothing else to do she longed to

flee to hide in some dark hole to cover
her shame from her father and the world
but in the hands of this determined man
she felt herself powerless what he willed
she dumbly did

  terry creek flowed out of the mountains
four miles north of san mateo an insig-
nificant stream entering the burntwood
half-way down to bowenville the john-
son ranch-house was a mile up the canon
where the rocky walls expanded into a
grassy park of no great area they reached
the girls home about half past nine that
night

  for two hours weir remained talking with
the father describing the occurrence at
bowenville fending off his first bitter anger
at the girl and gradually persuading him
to see that mary had been deceived lured
away on hollow promises and was guiltless
of all except taking him into their confi-
dence

  at last peace was made mary wept
for a time and was patted on the head by
her rough bearded father who exclaimed
 there there dont cry youre back
again well just forget it

  outside of the house however where he
had accompanied weir to his car he said
with an oath

   but ill not forget ed sorenson if i go
to hell for it my little girl

   shes half a child yet thats the worst
of his offense steele replied savagely

   mary said you choked him

   some not enough

 ill not forget -or you mr weir
steele mounted into his machine he
thoughtfully studied theranchers bearded
weather-tanned face illuminated by the
moonlight

   at present  d say nothing about this
matter to any one later on you may
able to use it in squaring accounts

gage on my little bunch of stock and on
my ranch here if i opened my mouth
about his son id be kicked off of terry
creek lock stock and barrel

   thats the way sorenson keeps all of
us poor devils white or mexican eating
out of his hand ive just been poor since
i came here a boy the gang in san mateo
wont let anybody but themselves have a
chance and i reckon old man sorenson
wouldnt care much if his boy had ruined
my girl cuss him a little maybe that
would have been all but  wont forget
the whelp some day my chance will come
to play even

   sure if one just keeps quiet and waits
steele agreed  well i must hit the trail
if you want work any time come over to
the dam we can always use a man with a
team

  johnson nodded

   after hayins done maybe and re-
member im much obliged to you for look-
ing after my little girl i wont forget that
either

  he reached up diffidently and shook
hands with the engineer weirs grip was
strong and sincere

chapter v

a secrict conference

     hope so was the answer with a bit-
ter note  but talking would only hurt
mary not ed sorenson whatever the
sorensons do is all right you know because
theyre rich the daughter of a poor man
like me would get all the black end of the
gossip and i cant lift a finger thats
what grinds me unless i go out and shoot
him then hang for it for hes got a mort-

     n a certain afternoon felipe martinez
     the lean and restless attorney who had
     acted as the mexican workmens mouth-
     piece observed through the broad plate-
     glass window of the san mateo cattle com-
     panys office an incident that greatly inter-
     ested him

     for the moment he forgot the resentment
     kindled by sorensons abrupt refusal and

 brutal words when he asked for the nomi-
     nation for county attorney the election

was in the autumn the nomination was
equivalent to election and felipe consid-
ered that he had too long been kept apart
from that particular spoil

  martinez had once had a slight difference
with the cattleman and now outrageously
sorenson had recalled it he had stated
that martinez should hold no office he gave
offices only to men who did exactly as he
cold steel



said his exact words were that the mexican
was  tricky and no good

  and picking up his hat sorenson who
had that day returned home from the east
went out of the building leaving martinez
to stare out the window and meditatively
twist a point of his silky black mustache

  it was before the window that there oc-
curred the meeting between sorenson and
the manager of the dam martinez per-
ceived the two men glance at each other and
pass but after a step or two both men
halted as if worked by a single wire they
slowly swung about and took stock of each
other	

  the mexicans nimble brain calculated
that they could not have previously met
and in consequence their conduct bespoke
something out of the ordinary

  the pair stood exactly where they had
turned three or four paces apart he noted
the mexicans mind palpitated with a
slight thrill of excitement the manner of
each of the men was that of a fighting
animal looking over another animal of the
same sort-neither uttering a word nor
stirring a fingernor yielding a particle in
his mixed unwinking gaze

  martinez could almost feel the exchanged
challenge the cold antagonism the hostile
curiosity the matching of wills the instant
hate between the men

  though they had not met before to be
sure nevertheless they were enemies was
it because of the discharge of the workmen
then martinezs mind flashed back to the
scene in yorses saloon when gordon had
shown such sudden emotion at the en-
gineers words and the latters enigmatical
reference to some event in the past

  that was it something which had oc-
curred thirty years ago something prob-
ably crooked men did things in those
early days that they would now like to
forget he would look into the matter

  sorenson passed out of sight and weir
likewise proceeded on his way thereupon
the lawyer sauntered over to the court-
house where presently he became engrossed
in a pile of tomes in the registers office
as examining records is a part of a lawyers
regular work it never aroused curiosity in
any one

    	argosy

  that same evening martinez perceived
yorse enter sorensons office vorse he re-
called had been included in the engineers
threatening attentions to gordon shortly
thereafter gordon himself ambled along the
street and passed through the door last
burkhardt short fleshy and bearded went
into the building

  presently martinez strolled by the office
outwardly displaying no interest in the
structure but furtively seeking to catch a
glimpse of the interior through a crack of
the drawn shade but in this he was un-
successful 

  of one thing he was certain however
his prolonged examination of the county
records had revealed an old bill of sale of
a ranch and cattle from one joseph weir
to sorenson vorse gordon and burk-
hardt he had placed his finger on one
link connecting the engineer with these men
the entire four as this old bill of sale thus
recorded showed the intimate though un-
expressed partnership of the men which
was common knowledge over the country
and intuition told him also that this private
conference by the quartet hard on soren-
sons return home had its inspiration in the
new manager of the dam

  martinez determined to continue his in-
vestigations events might prove that it
would have been much better for the cattle-
man to have given him the political nomina-
tion in any case it would do no harm to
have  something on  sorenson and the
others-these rulers of san mateo-for
future use and there was the other side
of the affair weirs side-so it looked as
if there might be profit either way

  the four men sitting in the railed-off
space in the san mateo cattle companys
office made up the cattle company more-
over they made up the financial political
and other powers of this remote section of
new mexico

  in face manner garb they were dis-
similar vorse clothed in gray was hawk-
nosed and impassive and though now like
his companions wealthy beyond simple
needs he continued the operation of the
saloon that had been a landmark in san
mateo for forty years


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  burkhardt was rough-featured rough-
tongued choleric and coatless typically
the burly uncurried uncouth stockman
whose commonest words were oaths or
curses and whose way with obstinate cattle
or men was the way of the club or the fist

  gordon was the wily cautious unscrupu-
lous politician he had represented san
mateo in the legislature for years both
during the territorial period and since new
mexico had become a state and was not
unknown in other parts of the southwest
and he engaged himself ostensibly in the in-
surance and real estate business

  like the others his share of the large
cattle sheep and land holdings of the
group made him independent

  sorenson the last of the four and in re-
ality the leader because of a greater breadth
of vision and a natural capacity for busi-
ness was dressed in a tailored suit of green-
ish plaid-a man with bushy eyebrows a
long fleshy nose predatory eyes a heavy
catfish mouth and a great barrel-like
body which reared two or three inches over
six feet when he stood on his feet but one
thing they had in common in addition to
the gray hair of age and that was a joint
liability for the past

  for years they had believed that that
liability had been extinguished through the
operation of time they had considered
the account of early secret lawless acts by
which they had acquired wealth and a grip
on the community as closed and sealed
they were now law-observing members of
society they controlled even if they some-
times failed to possess the good will of the
county-and they were not men to measure
position by friendships their councils de-
termined how much dr how little other men
should own and in local politics their
fingers moved the puppets that served their
will

  with the entrance of the powerful group
of financiers who were constructing the irri-
gation project they recognized the threat to
their old-time supremacy cattle and sheep
interests would succumb to farming a
swarm of new independent settlers would
arrive like locusts and their leadership
would eventually be challenged if not
ended

  new towns would spring up new money
would flow in to dispute their financial
mastery new leaders would arise to assail
their political dominion and against the
prospect of all this they had initiated a
secret warfare endeavoring by stealth to
ruin the irrigation company at the begin-
ning and nip the danger in the bud

  now it had been revealed all at once
that they had not only a general and im-
personal enemy in the form of the company
but a specific one in the form of a man its
manager out of nowhere he had emerged
out of thirty years silence a sinister figure
who tapped with significant finger the book
of their secret past while his eyes stead-
fastly demanded a reckoning did he know
all or nothing knowing did he deliber-
ately leave them in doubt to shatter their
confidence

  at least one of the four had been badly
shaken on learning weirs identity and all
now were uneasy it was as if fate after
a long wait finally was about to open the
sealed record

   perhaps you were just imagining
things senator sorenson was saying

  gordon moistened his lips and tugged
nervously at his gray mustache

  no no he exclaimed just ask
vorse the man said his name was weir
and that he was the son of joe weir then
-then-

   wrell sorenson demanded frowning
at the others visible trepidation

  pie added and i know what hap-
pened thirty years ago in this selfsame
room those were his very words isnt
that true vorse

   yes

   they could mean only one thing

   when the senator went out wreir said
to me vorse stated   that was for you
too i had my hand on my gun under the
counter as he said it ready if he made a
move he knew what i had there but it
didnt feeze him hes a better man than
joe ever was i want to remark and differ-
ent he has nerve and a bad eye he
knows something lay your bets on that

   how much how much if we only
knew that senator gordon vouchsafed
testily
cold steel



   how would he know anything joe
weir didnt know so how can this fellow
know dont get scared at a shadow it
was the bearded rough-tongued burkhardt
who spoke concluding his words with an
oath

   theres the mexican who saw-and
that boy who looked in at the back door
gordon asserted  we just caught sight
of him and couldnt makeout his face
against the light then he had skipped
when we ran there we never did learn
who he was

   do you think he remembers soren-
son said scprnfully  he may be dead
he may be on the other side of the world
just some kid who happened to drift by at
the minute and look in and theres riot one
chance in a million hes anywhere around
these parts yet he would have blabbed
long ago to some one if he had been dont
figure him in hes lost

   suarez isnt though

  at this vorse put in a word

   he saw more than one killing in those
days when he was roustabout for me it
was only one more to him probably has
forgotten it anyway vorse ended with
deadly emphasis  he knows what would
happen to him yet if he remembered it and
talked leave him out of the calculation
too

   then that just makes the four of us
said burkhardt  nobody else so this
fellow weir doesnt know a thing

   but we cant be absolutely sure gor-
don replied

   well hed need proof wouldnt he

   certainly to bring an action but how
do we know he hasnt even that look all
around the question as a lawyer does let us
assume the millionth chance for instance
suppose that he somewhere met and be-
came acquainted with that boy suppose
that he learned the latter had been here at
the time and seen the shooting and heard
his story suppose that weir knows this
instant where he is and can produce him as
a witness in court

   i reckon in this county his testimony
wouldnt count for much the ex-sheriff
stated with a harsh laugh

  sorenson however was impressed by-

gordons reasoning for he drummed with
his fingers on the desk and sat in brooding
silence so likewise sat vorse who had
heard weirs utterance and beheld his face

   he knows something he repeated in a
convinced tone  or hes a damned good
bluffer

   i passed him here at the door this after-
noon the banker remarked  i turned to
look at him guessing who he was and he
haj stopped and was looking at me cool
about it too well have to watch him
 perhaps if we just tip him off to keep
his mouth shut tight that will be enough
burkhardt suggested if he knows the
four of us are ready-

  vorse sniffed

   you think he can be bluffed he said
 you havent seen him yet go take a look
well not throw any scare into him if he
was that kind he wouldnt have told us
who he is he wanted us to know hes
after us thats my opinion lie wants to
shake our nerve-and he shook the sen-
ators all right that day at the bar

   he did gordon admitted  the
thing was so infernally unexpected almost
like joe weir himself appearing i didnt
sleep a wink that night what with my heart
being bad and what with seeing him

   suppose he has proofs vorse asked
after a pause while his narrowed eyes
moved from one to another of his com-
panions	v
a considerable silence followed the
question jerked into full light the issue that
had all the while been lurking in the re-
cesses of their minds an issue full of
ghastly possibilities gordons fingers
trembled as he wiped with his handkerchief
the cold sweat on his brow

   were all in it vorse added
burkhardt brought his fist down on the
desk with a sudden crash

   if he has proofs then its him or us
he exclaimed while the blood suffused his
face  him or us-and that means him
ill never go behind bars

   sure not none of us vorse said
itwill mean- gordon began in an
agitated voice but did not finish

  sorenson gave a nod of his head his
mouth was compressed determinedly


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   exactly hell never use his proofs
were in too far to halt now if matters
come to the point of his trying to use them
he has a grip on us in one way he knows
we cant declare his father joe weir did
the killing that would make us-what do
you call it senator

   accomplices after the fact besides it
would then come out that we had taken
over and shared among us his stuff-fifty
thousand apiece its a deplorable situa-
tion were in gentlemen deplorable if we
were but able to start the story joe weir
believed and fled because of it would cut
the ground out from under this mans feet
at once

   its him well cut not the ground under
him burkhardt growled thrusting his
hairy chin forward toward the lawyer
 and cut his damned throat

   i hate to think of our being forced to-
to homicide even justifiable homicide

   homicide nothing its just killing a
rattlesnake waiting in the brush to strike
thats the way we used to do in the old
days and if hes going to bring them back
thats what well do again

  sorenson smiled grimly

   well wait till were sure he has the
proofs then-

   then well act quick and sure vorse
shot out

   and quietly the cattleman added
 well take no more chances this time it
will be arranged carefully beforehand all
four of us will be in it of course-equal
responsibility-and therell be no wit-
nesses

  senator gordons face wore a pallid
sickish look

   i hope to god theres some other way
out of it he muttered

   so do all of us burkhardt snarled
 but if there isnt it means guns-for you
along with the rest of us

  the big cattleman leaned forward and
gazed from under his heavy brows com-
pelling gordon to meet his fixed look

  you were keen enough at the time for
your share of joe weirs stuff and to get
rid of him as a legislative candidate know-
ing he would probably beat you he said
 so youll play the hand out to the end

now the bad cards as well as the good
youre no better than the rest of us and it
was you who hatched the scheme for clean-
ing him up and put over the story

   i know i know but-but this would
be too much like cold-blooded murder

   murder sorenson grated  did you
look straight into this fellow weirs eyes
didnt you see something there that re-
sembled murder hed like only the
chance to kill us one by one with his own
hands i sat that much just as burk-
hardt said its him or us after you told
me about him i had only to take one look

   if he has the goods on us-well hell
have to die make up your mind to that
were back to the time of thirty years ago
and fighting for our lives were not only
all in on the weir job but the dent killing
-all of us if the facts become known
well be run into some other county and
court and hung and every enemy weve
made in these years past will put up his
head and clamor for our blood let that
sink into your mind

  the effect of this low fierce utterance
was to hammer the truth home gordon was
ashen vorses face appeared like an evil
mask burkhardt glowered savagely

  at that instant there sounded the faint
report of a shot from the street then as
the group sat unmoving rigid keyed to the
highest pitch of expectancy there followed
quickly two more shots afterward a
hush

  a gun-play issued from yorses lips
softly

  they all sprang up to hurry to the door

chapter vi

a shot in the dark

cteele weir driving his car down the
street in the dusk had caught sight of
felipe martinez standing near sorensons
office he stopped close by beckoned
martinez would do as well as another

   youre a notary i suppose he ques-
tioned

   yes mr weir most of us lawyers here
are he replied politely when he had ad-
vanced
cold steelj



   ive some papers here i want acknowl-
edged to-night must get them into the
mail going down to bowenville in the morn-
ing

   only too pleased to facilitate your
business mr weir my office is down a
few doors

   jump in

   its but a few steps

   then ill get out here and the en-
gineer stopped the engine and descended to
the ground

  along the street open doorways and win-
dows were already beginning to make yel-
low panels of lamplight in the thin gloom
the air was still warm balmy scented by
the lingering aroma of the greasewood
smoke of supper fires in mexican ovens
stars were jeweling the sky few persons
moved in the twilight

  one of these was a man who standing
at the door of a native saloon across the
street and a little farther up had come
diagonally over toward the spot on seeing
the engineer halt his car he walked with
a slouching haste seldom exhibited by a
mexican and gained the place as weir
stepped out there he slackened his pace
while he scanned the american with an in-
tense slow gaze that the engineer chancing
to raise his eyes squarely met

  mexicans always looked at him and fell
silent when he passed since he had shown
who was master at the dam in the eyes
of some was merely stupid curiosity in
some a shrinking and in many a half-
veiled hostility that did not trouble weir
in mexico he had dealt with recalcitrant
workmen of more lawless nature than these
he usually ignored them altogether now
as they were no longer in his employ but
this man seized his attention

  it was not yet too dark to mark his face
as he lounged past slowly turning his head
about as he progressed until his chin was
on his shoulder staring back his look the
while remained riveted on weir-a steady
contemplative evil regard in chihuahua
the engineer had once seen a notorious local
 killer  who had that same gaze

martinez also had glanced at the fellow
 who is that man one of the dis-
charged workmen weir asked him when

moving forward they in turn had passed
the mexican

   no i imagine not at any rate he
doesnt belong in san mateo or anywhere
about i know everybody for fifty miles
for ive been active in social and political
affairs hes unknown to me a stranger
then a little farther along  here is my
office mr weir ill have a light in an in-
stant ah now be so good as to have a
chair and well expedite your business

  as martinez filled out the acknowledg-
ment blanks on the papers his eyes furtive-
ly skipped over the vital portions of the
documents the latter were connected
with company business he had hoped
they would be personal so that he might
learn something more of this managers
affairs possibly more of his secret antagon-
ism for sorenson and his friends

  any intrigue appealed to the thin slip-
pery lawyers soul but most of allsome
one elses intrigue into which he might
profitably put a finger however from
these papers he was to learn nothing

  he had considered all possibilities of the
affair all possible solutions of what might
have occurred between joseph weir un-
doubtedly the father of the man sitting
across the table from him and the four men
now conferring in sorensons office this
was no petty squabble he divined there
was something going on under the surface
that was big-big and very dangerous
too for that moment in vorses bar was not
to be mistaken it had been tense electric
utmost caution on his part would be neces-
sary

  as between the two parties his sym-
pathies at present inclined toward weir
the refusal on the latters part to reemploy
the mexican workmen on their own terms
was purely a matter of policy and the law-
yers first gusty anger had long been for-
gotten

  but not so sorensons sneering words
that afternoon they struck to the heart
of his vanity breeding an animosity that
would last had not the cattleman stated
that he should hold no political office what-
ever after all his services too had he
not definitely shown martinez might never
expect anything there


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  well the lawyer wasnt one tamely to
yield his rights he did not purpose always
to remain a scrimping pettifogging attor-
ney existing on crumbs

  when with a flourish he had appended
his name to the acknowledgments and
affixed his seal he sat back thoughtfully
studying the engineer who was carefully
examining the paragraphs for errors he
knew his business martinez the man
would find no mistakes the lawyers eyes
suddenly glistened he arose and closed
the door as weir thrust the documents into
a stout linen envelope addressed and
stamped

   ill be pleased to see that your letter
goes to the mail in the morning he said
returning to his place  the stage leaves
at eight-thirty

   post-office is closed now i suppose
very well it will be an accommodation
the engineer responded

  martinez leaned forward

    if you can spare the time i should like
to have a little talk with you pardon me
if i appear presumptuous but as you are
aware mr weir i overheard your words to
senator gordon in vorses saloon i in-
ferred-check me at any instant if you con-
sider this none of my business-that there
exists some unpleasant feeling between you
two gentlemen and possibly others

   senator gordon has always handled the
companys business in his private capacity
of agent as you know hes a silent part-
ner in many enterprises with sorenson
vorse and a man named burkhardt they
run this town and county you should
know if you already dont that theyre
secretly opposed to your irrigation project
whatever they profess theyve misled the
people into believing it will work an injury
to the district whereas it will be beneficial
unfortunately too they lead the people by
the noses-but not me i refuse to be
subservient

   he paused to note the effect of his words

   now mr weir these are facts you can
confirm if you are not already acquainted
with them which i think you are be-
cause im independent in my opinions and
actions i stand in disfavor with these gen-
tlemen which may or may not be an objec-

tion in your view to what i have in mind
and this is it

   i should be pleased to execute any legal
work that you care to give me it might be
of advantage to your company to have at
times a representative other than gordon
who is not even a lawyer only a politician
who is alined against you and will serve his
own interest first hes in a position to
cause you embarrassment

   our eastern attorneys draw all docu-
ments

   of course but i was thinking of de-
lays more than anything else there are
a thousand ways a lawyer can push or halt
matters at will and your project will never
be free from legal red tape until completed
-if then im not unselfish in this i ad-
mit the business would be valuable to me
but aside from that id give you this ad-
vice anyway-secure another agent in any
case one without antagonistic personal in-
terests if you can find another in san
mateo besides me see im frank that
may sound egotistical but really im the
only free man among lawyers and ive
paid for my liberty

  he made a sweeping gesture to indicate
his shabby office

   if i had taken orders i could have been
county attorney and probably a judge but
i respect myself too much to take orders
from sorenson and his bunch i choose this
sort of thing in preference

  steele weir maintained a non-committal
silence again the thin dark-skinned law-
yer swiftly weighed the man before him
considered the dangers in which he might
become involved if he went a step farther
recoiled then grew bolder

  sorenson had marked him for poverty
and nonentity under the favoring shelter of
the irrigation companys power he might
arise from both for at moments the acute
mexican sensed the inevitable victory of
the new forces at work this one of the last
strongholds of old-time cattle and sheep in-
terests would break down yield to plow
and fence

   now theres something more though i
hesitate to mention it he went on doubt-
fully  while sorenson and his crowd run
things its not because the people-and
cold steel



that means us mexicans chiefly-love them
were indolent by nature we idle rather
than work borrow when we can rather than
earn-i speak of our race but were learn-
ing that work proves best in the long run

   those men have squeezed my people
and robbed them and kept them down
nothing more would i wish than to see
them deposed its no secret theyve built
their wealth by questionable methods but
who can prove it

   do you know what i suspect you
have something on sorensons crowd
thats why theyre uneasy thats why the
four are sitting over in sorensons office
this minute with their heads together meet-
ing the minute the cattleman arrives home
 saw them go in

   leaving aside the question of your own
affairs id like to see matters changed here
in this county so that every man had a fair
chance anything that will bring that
about enlists my interest when i heard
your statement to gordon and saw his face
i knew there was something in the past
that alarmed him i recalled a name i had
once run across when abstracting a title-
it was not this ingenious twisting of the
truth that caused the lawyer to become
filled with sudden dismay and stop but the
hardening of the engineers face

   go on weir commanded

   well the name was joseph weir i
looked it up again to be sure and found
the property had been deeded to sorenson
who still has it i wondered-

  what didyou wonder came with a
devouring look

   if-if joseph weir received considera-
tion according to law martinezs courage
flowed back again  ill make no attempt
to justify my curiosity sir except to say
that more than one man in the southwest
was done out of property in early days
and the practise has not ceased for that
matter but now the means are usually
legal and mexicans the victims sharp
mortgage dealings and so forth now if
ive said too much ill instantly forget all
about it on the other hand-

   well

   i might be of assistance if you wish
to look into that old transaction that is

if there was anything crooked about the
deal-and i set it down that there was with
sorenson mixed in and with vorse and
burkhardt the witnesses named in the deed
and gordon as notary taking the acknowl-
edgment of joseph weirs signature as the
record shows-then there should be some
weak spot that could be attacked

   there may be men yet alive conversant
with the circumstances they may know
whether duress or fraud was exercised sup-
posing the sale was not honest some of
the old mexicans may remember weir and
could give a clue they have good memories
for things of those days of course if the
transaction was all right then im all wrong
in my suppositions

  weir arose

   i can give you some of the companys
business perhaps considerable of it he
said

  martinez sprang up an expression of
gratitude upon his face he had not re-
alized all that he had hoped for but he
was nevertheless delighted

    im really sincere when i give you a
thousand thanks mr weir said he
spreading his arms wide  ill not make
promises as to the efficiency of my services
let results speak for temselves

   i always do was the comment  but
ill tell you what i demand in any one as-
sociated with me-absolute trustworthiness
first of all then loyalty and ability

   which leaves nothing martinez
smiled

  he preceded the engineer and swung the
door open stepping aside to the visitors
question regarding fees for the acknowledg-
ments taken he waved a declining hand

   nothing nothing delighted to render
you the service

  -	very well

   ill attend to the letter the lawyer
again assured him

   come out to the dam in a day or two
   to-morrow if you wish
  l to-morrow afternoon will do

  steele weirs frame filled the lighted
doorway as he stepped forth from the office
he paused to accustom his eyes to the dark-
ness for during his colloquy with the at-
torney full night had descended on the


argosy and railroad mans magazine

same side of the street with himself and
perhaps twelve or fifteen paces off he saw
a girls figure appear before a window and
disappear as she moved along

  then suddenly a tongue of red flame
darted at him across the street where lay
a space of unlighted gloom his hat was
whipped off his head the sharp report of
a shot cracked between the adobe walls

  with an unbelievably rapid movement
steele weir drew from his pocket the gun
which he had carried ever since his en-
counter with young sorenson in the restau-
rant fired twice where he had seen the
flame and leaped aside into the darkness
beside the doorway there he waited half
crouching for a further attack

  but none came men began to run to-
ward the place shouts and calls echoed
along the street in two minutes a crowd
was surging before martinezs door wildly
asking questions

  weir pocketed his pistol and walked back
into the office where he found his bullet-
pierced hat lying on the floor and the at-
torney standing frozen with astonishment
a stream of people followed at his heels

   who did this shooting do you know
felipe a tall raw-boned white man who
led them asked hastily

   this gentleman mr weir was fired
on sheriff martinez burst out volubly

   and i fired in return the engineer
stated  the fellow was across the street
in the dark you might look over there
turning and pushing his way through the
packed door the sheriff disappeared the
crowd melted away again presently as
weir glanced about he saw a new figure
at the doorway staring at him he went
toward the girl outlined in the lamplight

   was that you i saw moving along just
before the exchange of compliments miss
hosmer he asked

   yes i was coming toward you on my
way home

   it probably gave you a fright

   it did indeed i heard the shot and
saw your hat knocked off i just went cold
in mv tracks at first i believed vou were
killed

   im very much alive as you see

   but it was dreadful who would fire

at you from the dark some one tried to
murder you

   it looks like it still here i am ready
to move your car out of the water next
time its stalled

  she entered the room slowly

   who in san mateo would do such a
terrible thing mr martinez she ad-
dressed the lawyer the pallor was still on
her face and her eyes large with horror

   ah miss janet if we but knew wed
lay hands on him and send him to the peni-
tentiary

  real emotion struggled in the lawyers
words with the return of his senses he
had just begun to realize by what a narrow
margin had the assassins bullet missed de-
stroying his future client and prospects

  a growing murmur across the street at-
tracted their attention then as they con-
tinued to chat of the event the sheriff re-
appeared directing half a dozen men who
laid a burden in the light of martinezs
doorway

   you got him he said to weir with
ominous significance  one bullet through
the head one through his stomach hes
good and dead

  weir walked forward and inspected the
outstretched figure it was the man whose
gaze had been so malevolently fastened
upon him as he joined martinez before the
bank

   who is he he asked

   a strange mexican some of these
men say he showed up this morning and
hung around the saloons not talking much
didnt you ever see him before the
question expressed a perplexed curiosity

   once when martinez and i were
coming here to transact some business he
was taking a good look at me then when he
passed us that wasnt over half an hour
ago never saw him before that

   he shot at you first

   i had just stepped out of this room
could i see him hiding over there or
know he was there then he added  i
was taken by surprise but i saw the flash
of his gun

  the sheriff madden by name looked at
weir appreciatively

   you can use one yourself said he
cold steel



  martinez now repeated the fact of the
dead man having fired the first shot which
janet hosmer confirmed

   well is there anything more weir
questioned

   not to-night i reckon madden re-
plied well have an inquest in the morn-
ing show up then where will i find your
father miss hosmer

   at home then to the engineer she
explained  father acts in the absence of
the coroner whos away just now

   im very sorry this happened on your
account said he

 and im very glad you were not hurt
outside the corpse was being borne
away followed by the crowd of mexicans

   youre still shaken by the thing its
enough to upset any girl let me walk
home with you or you may be starting at
shadows all the way

chapter vii

janet hosmer

a silvery brightness shone in the east
as they came out of martinezs office
that increased as they went forward until
all at once the moon arose into view light-
ingthe street disclosing the flanking lines
of squat buildings revealing the tall cotton-
woods about the court-house and elsewhere
thrust up in the town

  janet hosmer breathed a sigh of relief
the darkness had seemed potent for further
evil but now it was as if the latter re-
treated with the shadows she felt a desire
to go on alone to separate herself from this
companion with whom chance had brought
her in contact at a dramatic moment to get
away from the whole terrible affair

  involuntarily her spirit shrank at the
nearness of the man for though he had
struck back in self-defense he nevertheless
had killed another and the act somehow
appeared to set him apart from ordinary
men isolate him give him the character of
an ishmael

  yet her feelings were confused against
this inclination was an avid curiosity or
rather a wonderment as to what must now
be occurring in his soul

  her eyes sought his face as he walked
beside her neither had spoken and his
countenance wore the same stern contained
aspect calm forceful as the first time she
had ever observed it

  but what was below the surface what
were the thoughts now revolving in his
mind and the emotions flowing in his
breast she could read nothing on that
composed mask of a face was it possi-
ble for a man to slay another human being
even justifiably without suffering a hurri-
cane of the spirit

  but perhaps he had killed men before
the fact of his carrying a weapon and his
swift deadly fire pointed ominously to pre-
vious experience

   did you ever shoot any one before
popped from between her lips then she
stopped clapping her hand over her mouth
in consternation and staring at him palely

  weir had halted too he regarded her
in silence for a little a slight smile resting
on his face they stood before the bank
and his look went past her once to embrace
the small darkened building

   im not a murderer by trade if thats
what you mean said he at last  but
ive killed a man or two before yes then
at the white anguish of her lips and cheeks
his tone softened a degree as he went on
 unfortunately since becoming of age
ive had to fight if not men then the
earth if not the earth then men some-
times both together you saw what hap-
pened to-night that fellow was unknown
to me he was not a workman who had
been discharged and felt he had a griev-
ance-

   oh no  she interjected  the mexi-
cans here wouldnt attempt to murder you
however angry they might feel

   im not so sure of that he answered

   but i am i know them ive lived
among them

   well let that go the man tried to
kill me at any rate however he was
merely a tool hired for the business by
some one else ordinarily i dont discuss
my affairs with any one but since youve
raised the matter ill just say that ive
enemies in san mateo who are anxious to
dispose of me


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   enemies here

   yes who would be delighted to see
me lie where that dead man lies and are
apparently determined to effect it he
touched her sleeve with a finger  hut you
will speak of this to no one

   no oh no not a word

  steele gazed at her steadily he already
repented disclosing even s little of his pri-
vate concerns an impulse altogether at vari-
ance with his close-mouthed habit but he
had for some vague reason felt it necessary
to explain his course to justify himself to
this clear-eyed fine-spirited girl he could
not let her rest under a misapprehension
that he was a brute who reveled in blood-
spilling and as he regarded her a con-
viction that she was absolutely to be trusted
settled firmly into his mind

  she would be stanch oxen and ropes
could not drag information from her once
she had determined not to speak yes she
would be loyal to her given word and to
her friends weirs eyes glanced at the dia-
mond on her finger it would be a girl
like her with whom he would have chosen
to mate if fate had not directed his feet on
a road which seemingly left him no choice
but incessant and solitary struggle

   i hate it all i have nothing but crusts
and nettles he exclaimed with sudden
fierce passion and with a quick movement
of his hand he beckoned her on

  submissively she accompanied him her
bosom rising and falling with a quickened
rhythm too much had happened one
thing piling on another for her to sort her
thoughts or to attempt to understand things
yet and in her tossing state of mind she
went at his gesture as one follows a guide
or as a simple matter of course

  in her mental turmoil that last passion-
ate utterance of the mans played like a
lambent flame tense violent spontane-
ous it had come from the heart what
harsh lot he had lived and sufferings borne
she could not even gdess but no man spoke
with such unconscious bitterness who had
not undergone pain and travail of spirit

  his head was now turned a little toward
her as they walked she perceived him star-
ing at the moonlit street his lips com-
pressed his brows knit

  then he glanced about at her his face
clearing

   pay no attention to what i said he
remarked  i shouldnt have let loose that
way hello whats on now

  before them and in front of the court-
house was a packed crowd people who had
run forth at the sound of shots augmented
by those who had since arrived upon the
scene it was motionless

   stand back stand back dont trample
the body came sheriff maddens voice in
an angry order

  the crowd surged a little apart in the
center

   how do you know this dead man fired
the first shot asked some one vehemently

  the voices went lower so that steele
weir and janet hosmer who had paused
at the edge of the throng were able only to
catch the tones

   who was that that questioned the
sheriff weir whispered

   mr burkhardt i think sounded like
him

  so intent were the mexicans upon the oc-
currence in their midst that those close by
remained with backs toward the pair fail-
ing to notice their presence all craned
eagerly to miss nothing of the controversy

   how do you know this engineer didnt
start it came burkhardts voice again

   dont be a fool there were witnesses

   id like to talk to those witnesses i
doubt if they really saw anything it looks
to me as if theres another side to this shoot-
ing

   well of course you know -you sitting
there in the bank as you say was the
ironical retbrt

  at this juncture another voice interposed

   madden we want no mistake here
this weir doesnt bear a very good reputa-
tion for peacefulness from what ive
learned if this mexican has simply been
shot down-

   who is that steele demanded of the
girl  i cant see him

  that-janet hosmers speech fal-
tered- that is mr sorenson oh they
misunderstand let me push in there and
tell them how it happened

  the engineers hand closed on her arm
cold steel



   youll do nothing of the kind he com-
manded low

   but-

   no remain quiet and listen

  her eyes flew up to his at this extraordi-
nary course so injurious to his own inter-
ests she was anxious to press to the front
and declare his innocence in the affair of
everything but defending his life from an
assassin she could not understand why
he also was not eager to spring forward
why he restrained her then she saw the
implacable hatred on his face

  a thrill quivered through her body the
feeling she had at that instant was one of
being on the point of seeing behind the cur-
tain of a mystery of making a discovery
so sinister that she would gasp her very
finger almost rested upon it

  why were mr sorenson and mr burk-
hardt talking as they were trying by
innuendo to make it seem her companion
might have been guilty of a crime could
it be- her blood slowly congealed to ice
at the horror of where her reasoning led

  could it be they were the enemies he
meant

  such a thing was too dreadful too ab-
surd they the respected leaders of the
community could never put a pistol in the
dead wretchs hand to slay this man beside
her mr sorenson the father of ed
whom- she stared blankly at her ring

  yet the cattlemans heavy smooth words
continued to assail her ears steadily she
grasped their import once more

   for the story is too thin no man
could hit another man across the street in
the dark as this engineer claims not only
once but twice put a bullet where it would
kill probably the dead man had some-
thing on this weir and the latter knew it
its not impossible he found the fellow in
his path drew and murdered him at once
quickly put a hole in his own hat and then
carried the body across the way running
back to martinezs office the thing could
have been done in a minute martinez
himself wouldnt have seen how it was
worked im not saying that was exactly
how it was done or that this weir did
actually murder him but - investigate
madden investigate

  steele weir felt an angry tug at his
sleeve he looked around and beheld janet
hosmers eyes distended with incredulity

   come away come away she whis-
pered  i should never have believed it if
i hadnt heard with my own ears

   keeping close to the line of buildings
they skirted the crowd still unnoticed and
left it behind she walked with quick
nervous steps her hand yet unconsciously
grasped his coat sleeve all the way to
her house which they found dark since a
messenger had called the doctor to the
court-house and the mexican servant girl
also was gone she said nothing

   come up on the veranda i want to
talk she announced when he opened the
gate

   wouldnt it be best if you took your
mind off the whole thing by a book or
something else ill go

    as if i could take my mind off there
are matters in this i must know you may
wonder when i say it mr weir but this
happening concerns me more than you
dream her dark glowing gaze brooded
on him with a sort of intense determination
then she went on  it-it involves my
whole future as well as your own though
in a different way so come insider if you
please

  weir in silence accompanied her upon
the dark broad vine-clad porch in the
half-gloom he found chairs for them

   im going to the point at once she
declared  why did mr sorenson talk in
such a fashion and he could feel her
bending forward as if hanging on his an-
swer

    thats the one thing i cant discuss
said he

   i must know i must know

    and unhappily i must refuse

   oh mr weir if you could but un-
derstand what this involves for me you
wouldnt hesitate i was shocked at the
shooting but i saw its necessity on your
part youre not one to run from a foe a
cowardly foe least of all but what i heard
there in the street horrified me i couldnt
believe it i can scarcely credit my ears
yet mr sorenson and mr burkhardt were
not near when you were attacked they


argosy and railroad mans magazine

are not acquainted with the circumstances
or facts as you mr martinez and i know
them they apparently didnt appear until
the crowd started away with the dead man
yet at once-

    aye at once steele weir let slip

    at once immediately when they had
barely heard the story they began to tear
it to pieces and suggest another making
you out a villain youre only an ac-
quaintance sir scarcely more than a stran-
ger but as i listened it outraged my sense
of justice mr sorenson of all men my
brain was in a whirl but its steady now
the engineer failed to open his lips at
her pause

    im no fool mr weir i think of other
things besides dressing my hair and using a
powder puff i can sometimes put two and
two together-when i see the  twos  clear-
ly now tell me why mr sorenson talked
as he did for i must have my eyes clear
 ask me anything but that miss
hosmer

   he sat distressed and uneasy at her pro-
longed muteness suddenly she questioned
quietly

   are those two men the enemies you
spoke of

    it will save me embarrassment if i go
he remarked starting to rise  i dont
want you to hate me you know and yet i
cant say anything

   her grasp pulled him imperatively back
    you shall not go yet

   vthen i can only continue to decline
making answers i frankly say that i re-
gret having uttered a word of explanation

     i dont regret it and i intend to keep
questioning you however rude you may
think me  must know she cried im-
petuously  and i shall know mr soren-
son is one of the men you referred to or he
would never seek to direct suspicion at you
i saw the look on your face sir as he spoke
but why should you two be enemies you
come here a stranger to san mateo or
have you been here before some time did
you know him before

   again he could feel her eyes straining
at him

    it seems mad to think of him and mr
burkhardt and perhaps others hiring some

one to shoot you down from a dark door-
way it is utterly mad-crazy but why
should they want to convict you in the
crowds opinion at least of murdering the
man it would not be just trouble about
the dam-oh no i cant see through it at
all why wont you tell me you can
trust me-and i want to help you as well
as help myself you certainly dont hold
against me my silly nonsense and unkind
words of the day you brought me home
from the ford

   i didnt think them silly they de-
lighted me he responded  i hadnt had
anypg happen to me so refreshing in
yearst

   we must be friends something tells
me theyre going to make you trouble over
this shooting and youll need friends

   something tells me youre right in both
respects he laughed

   and friends must stick together

   thats what they should do

  in the dusk of the vine-clad flower-
scented place where they sat he experi-
enced the subtle power of this intimacy
not a soul stirred in the empty moonlit
street before the house no sounds dis-
turbed the warm peace of the night only
there ran in this secluded spot the murmur
of their voices	

   i could never stand by and see any
man unjustly accused and defamed if i
knew he was innocent without lifting up
my voice in defense she proceeded  but
let me ask if on your side youre treating
me fairly

  weir could have groaned

   you have a noble spirit miss hosmer
youre more courageous and kind than any
girl ive ever known would you have me
reveal what my best judgment tells me
should remain untold

   but what of me would you keep it
to yourself if my future happiness might
turn on it

  the appeal in her words shook steeles
heart

   how does this business affect your hap-
piness how he asked in perplexity

  now it was her turn to hesitate why
should she pause indeed before telling to
this man what every one else knew yet
mustered out



hesitate she did from a feeling she could
but partly analyze of her fiance she had
already had disturbing secret doubts that
had increased of late doubts of his habits
his character and the worthiness of his
love so that it was with a little eddy of dis-
satisfaction and shame that she admitted
the relationship more she questioned her
own love as an actual thing

  in a startling way too this silent force-
ful man so deadly in earnest and so earn-
estly deadly so terrible in some aspects
seemed at the instant to dwarf the other in
stature and power as if the latter were a
plump manikin

  perhaps at the last minute she had a
shiver of dread at what might issue from
the engineers lips in the way of facts if he
took her at her word and told her what she
had demanded to know did she want to
know suppose she let the affair rest where

to be continued

it was and went forward to the future in
the comfortable assurance of ignorance

  in that case that might be wooing revela-
tions that then could not be escaped like
consuming lightnings she would settle it
now once for all

   it does concern my future and my hap-
piness vitally she declared earnestly
 for this reason-

   yes

   im engaged to marry ed sorenson son
of mr sorenson

  weir leaped to his feet

  good god that fellow he ex-
claimed astounded

  without another word he sprang down
the steps and strode away janet hosmer
grasping the arms of her chair and staring
after him saw him once bring down his
clenched fist on nothing then he passed
rapidly along the street and out of sight
next week

sergeant aloysius larrigan
inspected the houses ahead-and
hesitated before he found name and
wealth and fame in california film fields
aloysius larrigan had been born and
raised in new york hence he knew the
metropolis he knew that behind him on
fifth avenue were the false jewels and
that here ahead of him was the real thing
here half a block off fifth avenue was
the house of jim bleeker bunky of ser-
geant aloysius larrigan

  but the sergeant hesitated gripping the
package a little harder in his hand then
mustering up courage he approached the
doorway and rang

  the outer door opened and a stolid but-
ler gazed at him

   i-ive come to see mrs bleeker said
the sergeant nervously

   its quite early sir answered the but-
ler somehow stifling his first instinct of
blank rejection  i hardly think sir that
mrs bleeker is-

  look here snapped larrigan flush-
ing  ive just landed from france my

c

if h bedford - jone

fivs
ss	argosy and railroad mans magazine

name is larrigan jim bleeker was my
hunky-

    if youll step inside sir hastened the
hutler changing countenance abruptly
 im sure that mrs bleeker will wish to
see you

  aloysius larrigan tat himself down be-
tween a mounted piece of fifteenth-century
armor and a dull-gleaming rubens all
this he knew was the real thing he had
guessed that jim bleeker was an aristocrat
but-well all this was a bit crushing be-
fore he quite realized it mrs bleeker in
her widows black was upon him and hold-
ing his hand

  jim wrote me so much of you she
was saying quietly  im very very glad
to know you mr larrigan i received
your letter from bordeaux telling me of
the final days- i cannot tell you how i
appreciatedthe sweetness of that letter

  aloysius larrigan blushed fearfully he
stammered something and fell silent

   you must stay for luncheon-but how
jong shall you have in the city

   no time at all maam returned
aloysius he displayed his package
l were going through town to be mus-
tered out and then  have to hit for cali-
fornia ive got important business there
you see- a lady ive not seen for a year
and also business i just got permission
to run up here with this

  he thrust forward the package all his
carefully rehearsed speech and actions gone
to the winds

   you see mrs bleeker jim made me
promise to bring these things here myself
they are just the little things well youll
see he thought maybe you would like to
have them i have to be back in half an
hour

  mrs bleeker took the package bit her
ljp very hard and then threw back her
shoulders and looked aloysius larrigan in
the eye he realized that hers was a
peculiar bravery-the courage of deep
things of rare blood of a sensitive inner
grief that was tearing her very soul before
his eyes

  he felt tongue-tied and extremely un-
comfortable far different from the easy as-
surance habitual to him

   wait just a minute please she said
and left him

  he waited gazing at the velvet hangings
the deep softness of everything around him
feeling himself frightfully out of place
the knowledge that he was an american
soldier and as good as any man alive did
not help him

  then he smiled grimly at thought of how
little the studio directors knew about the
furflishings of an aristocratic home all
the studio men knew about was the flashy
emptiness of the newly rich and the pro-
fessional decorator

  mrs bleeker was before him again

   im more sorry than i can tell you mr
larrigan that you have to run away so
quickly when you get settled in califor-
nia will you please send me your address
one does not know what unforeseen emer-
gencies may arise

  aloysius promised

  mrs bleeker produced a little morocco

case

    i would like you to have this she said
quietly very steadily  i brought it to jim
once he always wore it theres no other
man i could give it to mr larrigan-but
if you would accept it you would give me
great pleasure

  larrigan gazed at the scarf-pin an
abalone blister mounted in gold

  it came to him that this was a very
precious tribute a tribute from the womans
heart meaning more than words could say

  jim bleeker had other friends of course

-	wealthy friends college friends all that
a man of his standing would have but
he larrigan had been bleekers bunky in
france had watched jim bleeker die had
been more to jim bleeker than any man
alive

  and this was a tribute the most precious
heart-gift he would ever know

   i-id be very glad he said stumbling
over the words cursing himself because he
could not express the thing that was in him
the feeling that gripped him in that moment
of revelation  ill be wearing cits in a
couple of days i-i sure appreciate this
very deeply mrs bleeker

   theres no other man i could give it
to she said again very softly
mustered out



  this was all he was thankful that his
face seemed quite unknown to her

  reever keene was home again-reever
keene the great reever keene the man
who had snapped asunder his fabulous
contract a year ago in order to enlist as a
private reever keene whose pictures
were the greatest drawing-card in every
theater of the country

  he had sent no notice of his coming but
the studio knew of it and was ready as
the overland drew in sixteen automobiles
were waiting and these automobiles were
the cream of motion-picture motordom all
los angeles knew that the aluminum car
with purple trimmings was reever keenes
that his director owned the pea-green twin
duplex striped with canary that his lead-
ing lady had paid eleven thousand dollars
for the screaming blue-and-gold roadster
and so forth

  but a terrible thing happened at the
station-a thing which fortunately was
kept out of the papers by influence as
one of the lesser lights of filmdom grasped
the hand of the great keene he gave a
raucous laugh

   for heavens sake reever whered
you get the abalone sparkler wow
look at it folks pipe the-

  reever keenes fist smashed him square
in the mouth

  the press-agent wanted to use the story
of course but reever keene took the press-
agent by the nape of the neck and kicked
him hard influence did the rest-adver-
tising influence the story was killed

   i cant understand whats got into
keene said the director riding back to
the studios with the president of the com-
pany  and look at the face of him
well have to paint him an inch deep to
disguise that brick-red tan and make him
come out like the old screen idol fortu-
nately his profile is all right still

  the president grunted he was a wise
man or he would not have been in his
present position

   keene takes up his contract where he
left off he returned  thats all im
worrying about let keene run the whole

damned place if he wants if youd gone
into thf army my son instead of sitting on
your draft-proof job the lord knows youd
be a damned sight better director

  the director looked at his leather puttees
and said no more

   wheres lola asked reever keene
driving to the studios in his own car once
more his leading lady and chief supports
gathered around him  thought she might
be around

   shell turn up at the studios was the
response  working on a location near
santa monica to-day theyll be back for
dinner were having a real celebration
old boy

  lolas awful proud of that sparkler you
gave her simpered the leading lady
 heaven knows it was a beaut

  reever keene shivered a little he was
not sure why he shivered nor was he
sure why the warmth and cordiality of his
reception at the studio left him cold and
hard

  he had not thought it would be this
way he had looked forward to falling
right back into the old rut among the old
friends and he had anticipated swaggering
like a good one-all kinds of publicity in it
but somehow he found himself landing
with a horrible jar he was damned glad
he reflected to be done with the bare sim-
plicity of the soldiers life with the saluting
and uniforms and general prophylaxis and
yet-

  homesickness had glamoured all the old
life but now that he was back in it the
glamour seemed unaccountably like tinsel
the directors for instance even his own
director and old crony with their puttees
and riding-breeches general superiority and
bustling business-well maybe it was the
puttees that grated keene had saluted
leather puttees until he was heartily sick of
it but that was another story altogether

  he wondered inwardly if he had ever
been like the men now around him-good
fellows of course but abominably artificial
these fancy tailored garments these amber
cigarette-holders and sodden cigarettes
without a bite these flashing jewels and
worst of all this breezy talk that moved in
perpetual high lights-

  what the devil was the matter with him
anyhow maybe it was because lola had
not come yet

  well lola came with a stifled shriek
and a tiny peke and flung herself at him
good heaven keene had been away from
studio paint so long that her appearance
frightened him and had he really picked
that engagement ring that diamond like a
walnut yes he remembered hideously
the glee with which he had nonchalantly
signed that five-thousand-dollar check and
the delight with which he had seen the
check pictured in the papers

   youve been away a hell of a long time
old sport and his director clapped him on
the back  but now youre back to the
life-the only life boy

   right you are cried reever keene
bracing his shoulders lets have a
drink

iii

  the fact that reever keene home from
the army insisted on working with an
abalone blister in his scarf was an idio-
syncrasy good for three-day comment in
the press and the press-agent sighed for
the lost opportunities that were closed to
him simply by the stubborn deviltry of
keene nobody knew what had got into
the screen star he had changed the
abalone pin for instance was a sore subject
with him

  he never wore any of his former loud
attire and had discarded all his jewelry
which formerly flashed in the cabaret lights
of los he even wore that abalone pin
stuck in the front of his dress shirt for a
society picture and when the director ex-
postulated keene bluntly told him to go to
hell-which was no way to treat a famous
director

  then somebody in the scenario depart-
ment-that is somebody in the orange-
hued-flivver class-had an inspiration he
wrote a story about that abalone pin
keene according to his contract had the
say about what film stories were to be ac-
cepted for his use and he went into closed
session with the scenario department and
there was evolved a scenario which made
the director gasp but the scenario went

through it had to go through with keene
backing it

   whats come over him said the
president to the director  he used to get
stories written by his friends turn down
everything from the department make us
pay five hundred dollars for the stories -
and then split with his friends thats the
old stall whats this new wrinkle

   damned if i know groaned the di-
rector  its got society stuff- in it and
only last week he said hed never touch
society stuff again and there aint any
punch not a bit its one o them bleedin-
heart things and it aint got-

   its got reever keene in it snapped
the president  and thats enough to put it
across anywhere do you get me

  the director departed weeping

  worse was to come however reever
keene sold his gorgeous car and showed up
with a plain green-black affair-not even a
victoria top to it lola refused to ride in
the wretched thing and keene swore and
the end of this matter was a fine quarrel
which the press-agent featured without the
least opposition

  and then came the first of the month
and the new story

  the story was a society story right
enough for three days the company was
on location at the billingkamp residence-
you remember of course billingkamps
canned soups-and the exteriors were gor-
geous affairs

  the trouble was that reever keene had
been reading some highbrow stuff and in-
sisted on wearing his silk hat without any
of the rakish tilt which is so fetching to the
screen folk and he insisted on throwing
out the beautiful white roadster with red
upholstery which the director had provided
and used his own sobersides of a car-and
other things like that

  in between times the quarrel with lola
was deftly adjusted the date was set for
the wedding and duly featured by the
press-agent

  after that the company came back to
the studio the remainder of the picture
being interior sets-and then the trouble
really began reever keene had instruct-
ed the property-men about the drawing-
mustered out



room set the director had done likewise
props seeing himself between the devil and
the deep sea provided both sets and left
the principals to scrap it out which was
wise

  reever keene took one look at the di-
rectors set and ordered it off the stage
the director was inspecting reever keenes
set and keene met him in the act

   my lord said the director   dont
know anything about motion-pictures im
just a poor simp whos spent all his life in
the game look-for the love of fleaven
look

   get down to cases you growled
keene  never mind the high-art stuff
now just be sensible and jell me whats
wrong

  the director swallowed hard and waved
his hand at the set it had been assembled
with a good deal of trouble there was an
imitation rubens there was a real set of
imitation armor that looked from the cam-
era considerably like fifteenth century
the rest was deeply rich velvet and
hangings

   as man to man said the director
 ill put it to you keene how do you
think this dark stuff is going to take all
to the bad it cant be done man youve
got to have contrast now cant you
realize that this picture has got to show a
society home a real swell home none
of your junk but stuff that spells money
they eat it the people do

   if you knew the money wed spent on
this set began the property-man plaintive-
ly but keerie interrupted

   what would you suggest then

  just what i ordered set up returned
the director  statuary a nude on the
wall some o this here lacquered chinese
furniture-we got bents whole store to
draw on and you know the best people
aint buying anything else but lacquered
which shows up like real money then
that high-colored rug and so forth it 
be toned down fine in the film keene

   maybe so maybe so said reever
keene

   and then these here costumes i been
reading over your directions the director
tapped the papers in his hand with growing

   	argosy

boldness  i notice you got white neck-
ties with evening clothes you knows well
as  do they dont make contrast then you
got die society dames ordered to cut out
the low-neck stuff- what the hell give
you such a notion of society anyhow
dont you know they run around half
naked and no jewels my lord if i
was to run out such a picture the society
papers would give me plain hell

   if you had ever read them at all said
keene dryly  youd see they do that any-
how

  a few minutes later the president sent
for reever keene

   take a cigar reever he said genial-
ly  now well have to cut out this
fussing between you and bob see hes
a damned good director im not paying
him twenty-five thousand dollars for noth-
ing

   let him mind his own business then
said keene a little white around the jaw
 ive got a good picture and hes not to
spoil it

   sure not agreed the president affably
 but see here now hes contracted to
put out your pictures aint he all right
and hes got the say

   in other words said keene slowly
 ill have to stand for his directing in this
picture eh

 sure his contract is up in three
months if you want ill put you in
charge of your own directing after that
 then stop work on this picture until
hes out of it

   cant do it reevenwere a week be-
hind on the next release and its got to be
rushed thats why im putting it up to
you straight to work in with him now and
well work in with you later see

  reever keene nodded curtly

   ill try he said  but-i wont
promise

   the hell he wont laughed the presi-
dent later when he was recounting the con-
versation to the director  like the rest
of them-throwing a big bluff so he can
strut around the screen club and tell how
he handed it to me well thats one way
of managing these here stars believe me
this guys getting more money than the


argosy and railroad mans magazine

president of these here united states is
he going to chuck his job

   not him said the director confidently
 besides hes under contract to us and if
he broke the contract-

   hed be finished absolutely declared
the president  hes no fool

  the president was playing both ends
against the middle which is a wise game-
sometimes

iv

  reever keene had been too long in the
movie game and was taking too much
money out of it to have any artistic tem-
perament-that is when he was on the lot
movie folk have to keep their temperament
out of business

  still when keene saw what his director
was doing to the abalone-pin story and
realized that he could not prevent its being
done he boiled with inward and suffocating
rage after three days he was so stifled
with fury that he was ready for an out-
break

  he had put jim bleeker into that story
and when he saw how the director was
handling jim bleeker despite all protests
his fury became white-hot

  on the fourth morning he drove to the
studio without opening his private mail
once in his dressing-room he glanced over
the letters while he was making up but
for him that mail resolved itself into just
one letter he propped it in front of him
and read it over again

  dear mr larrigan-

     within a few clays i am leaving for europe
  to take part in reconstruction work i could
  not leave without writing you to express
  anew my very deep appreciation of allyour
  thoughtful kindness to jim i know from his
  letters what your friendship meant to him
  and i have learned from other comrades of
  your great devotion toward the end thanks
  seem but a little thing to offer yet believe
  me my thanks and appreciation come from
  the soul

    i know nothing of your financial position
  or status in civil life and i do not wish you
  to think that i am insulting so deep and pure
  a thing as your friendship with jim how-
  ever i am enclosing a card from my attor-
  neys who are fully instructed to honor it in
  any way if you should ever be in need of
  advice or aid it will give me great happiness

  to know that you will make use of this card
  as though it had been handed you by your

   friend

                           jim bleeker

  bless her sweet heart muttered reever
keene tearing the card across and tossing
it into his waste-basket he smiled a little
as he thought of his twenty thousand dol-
lars in cash buried where no one would ever
detect it and of the kansas oil stock held
by a friend which brought in itself a com-
fortable income everybody in the busi-
ness thought that reever keene blew all he
had like every one else but aloysius lar-
rigan knew better

  he read the letter again fingering the
blister pearl in his scarf and forgetting his
make-up completely once more he was
standing in that house half a block off
fifth avenue once more he was living
through that moment when mrs bleeker
had handed him that scarf-pin with her
quiet steady voice and her brave stricken
eyes

  the thought of it made him sit very
quiet staring at the letter in all his life
he had never experienced a moment such as
that no not even when jim had died
beside him it had been a moment of the
spirit a moment of absolute integrity of
purity of unsullied sweetness

  that moment had assoiled many long-
soiled years it had grown upon larrigan
ever since had grown larger had grown to
mean much more than he had dared admit
now this letter had come to bring it before
him again in all its larger aspects

  he made up mechanically and went out
on the lot for an hour he acted mechan-
ically obeying the director without protest
without thought then during a change
in the set he went to his dressing-room

  lola was there standing at his table
reading the letter something went cold
inside reever keene and he stepped for-
ward as if to take it from her but she
turned upon him a flood of passion in her
face

   well she observed with a sneer  i
guess i got your number now mr larri-
gan lady signs herself jim bleeker does
she maybe were goin to hear a lot of
things that happened-
mustered out



   youre making a mistake lola said
reever keene

   mistake am i she shook the letter
at him with sudden passion  maybe i
dont know a chickens writing when i see
it huh well if you think im a fool
this ends it you can go along with your
jim bleeker all you damn please when
you get ready to talk turkey to me-

  lola drew off the walnut diamond and
laid it very carefully on the corner of
the dressing-table under reever keenes
nose the whole action was very statu-
esque and very dramatic at least was so
intended

   an instant later lola uttered a despairing
shriek reever keene had seized the wal-
nut diamond and had hurled it throughthe
open window-hurled it with a swing that
sent it glittering through the air to heaven
only knew where

   ends it eh snapped keene  then
im blamed glad of it so-long

  lola fainted as he vanished and imme-
diately the dressing-corridor was filled with
figures answering her final dramatic shriek
reever keene went outside and climbed
into his plain green-black car and drove
down the street to his lodgings

  once there he wiped the paint from his
face with a curse and began to pack up
his things he paid his landlady he
burned mrs bleekers letter over the oil-
stove then he threw his stuff together
in the rear of the car and drove down to
the bank where he drew what money he
kept deposited there

  this finished he went to the central
gasoline station and turned over his car
to be filled with gas and oil and to be load-
ed with sundry extra five-gallon cases of the
same

  while he was watching these affairs being
brought to conclusion he heard a wild hail
and saw the presidents car stopping at the
curb and the president himself descending
red and perspiring of face

  hey keene demanded the magnate
heatedly  what the devils struck you
they said you blew out o the studio like
a wild man and quit work get on back
there-

   go to hell snapped the star  ive
quit being keene im aloysius larrigan
see and dont get fresh you

   what where you going

  im going to kansas where i got busi-
ness retorted larrigan  hurry up with
them two cans of oil over there and
blow up the extry tires while youre about
it partner

  the president seized him by the arm

    look here you  he exploded violently
 are you quittin on the job-quillin

   i am said larrigan coldly

   by heaven if you bust this contract
  see to it that you never get another job
in front of any damned camera in the
world raved the other ill-

   you said larrigan  and your con-
tract and your seventeen companies and
your directors and your money and your
whole damn camera battery and your
entire double-dashed motion-picture indus-
try-go to hell im done mustered
out

  he shoved a greenback at the gasoline
dealer climbed into his car and went
the president gazed after him with eyes
of dulled glazed despair

   bein in the army-thats what done it
for him-ruined the best star in the whole
damned works he murmured dismally
 damn the kaiser

i

nita met me at the station i shall
always remember her as i saw her
from the car window that day sitting
bolt upright among the soft rose cushions
of the family carriage staring fixedly at her
hands and i recall now a curious impres-
sion of fear in her attitude-the merest
suggestion-so vague that it passed as she
looked up her dark eager face was gleam-
ing as brightly as did the silver trappings
on the black horses uncle jesse an aged
colored man stood ready to assist me

   you are just in time eleanor to find
us at out maddest she cried as we drove
slowly through the narrow crowded streets
over which monogrammed terraces jutted in
decaying splendor  i promise you such
adventures as you in your unromantic new
york never dreamed could happen

  she pointed out historic places talking
in a sort of feverish way as though she
must be saying something all the time on
every hand gay buntings and excited dark
faces proclaimed the joy of mardi gras
that season when care ceases to be in the
quaint old creole city and love and light
and color are all

  we trailed along between flanks of decay-
ing ivy-colored mansions soft strange
negro melodies mingled with the cries of
dirty-faced children who sprang out of al-
leys or doorways and urged us to buy a

st anthony or a st joseph- for good
luck

  merrymakers rushed this way and that
sidewalks and streets were thronged white
brown and yellow faces all eager excited
passed a smiling panorama horns and
musical balloons aided in the expression of
their excess emotion it was the citys
great playtime and no smallest moment
must be lost young and old business men
and loafers mingled in happy disregard for
work or time or circumstance all hurrying
toward canal street where the joyous din
of noise was more insistent

  a mulatto woman selling pralines kept
up an incessant wail that slowly died in
the distance as we passed on a young
octoroon strode by us she never looked
to right nor left but her long arms sawed
the air like rhythmic pendulums and she
sang to save a poor sinner like me

  a little unbalanced nita shuddered
 she keeps that lip from sunrise to sun-
down

  and all at once she fell to gazing at
her hands they were frail blue-veined
idle hands but they had no special claim
to beaut- nor did it seem vanity with
her she studied them as if she found in
them some unfathomable problem some-
thing beyond her comprehension or belief
for the moment any presence was forgotten
she came back with a start

   there is the old hotel royal she said

 
whose hands



 one day you must come and see it it
has been condemned for years but the stave
block and the grand stairway are worth
seeing royalty have lodged there does
it not seem odd-they laughed and danced
and sang-and then-the worms

  she talked on and on until her evident
excitement began to project itself into my
own consciousness it was as if some fear
in the back of her mind were being tele-
graphed to mine

  directly i noticed that the huge wester-
ing sun whose long golden tongues had
been struggling with the shadows of evening
to the left of us was now on our right

   i was prepared for many things i re-
marked  but not for the phenomenon of
a sun that shifts from west to east in the
hour are we going north or south

   we cant speak of the points of the
compass here she said  on account of
the bend of the river which turns due north
at the head of canal street and the streets
follow the river therefore in going down-
town you find the sun setting in what seems
the east also you may get the impression of
shifting if you continue long in what seems
the same direction instead of north south
east and west we say  woodside riverside
down-town and back o town

   did i not promise you adventures
and if you can explain them as easily as i
have explained the phenomenon of the shift-
ing sun you may count yourself both clever
and lucky dr richard says everything
in life can be explained mais le pativre
docteur is an infidel

  she spoke gaily but i thought i caught
an undercurrent of deeper meaning

  after what seemed but seconds so
charmed was i with the scene through which
we drove our carriage stopped

   this is esplanade my hostess was
saying it is the oldest residential part
of town

  i followed her across the sunken pave-
ments to a big iron gate from it a wide
passage tunneled under the building to an
open court she pulled a knob on the
side of a gate and a gong boomed so loudly
in the distance that it startled me there
was a flash of ebon features topped by a
bright bandanna a low wooden door

opened and i followed nita up the stone
stoop then down two little steps and into a
narrow alleyway

  the brick walls on either side of us were
quite wet a musty odor assailed us and a
sort of chill crept over me then we came
to a dark stairway a small bell sounded
somewhere in the house as nita reached
the top she turned to wait for me and
i came up from the dark murey regions
into a luxurious reception-hall

  a man hurried toward us

   ah madame cried the pleasant voice
of my host grasping both my hands in the
effusive fashion of the cordial creole  at
last we have the joy to see you again

 after removing our hats we went at once
into the great dark dining-room full of
shadows and old-world magnificence the
day was warm but a dampness was in the
room a negro boy bending over in a big
fireplace tried to encourage a small fire

  we sat down at once to the early dinner
that was their custom the white table
with its old silver plate gleamed brightly
at the solemn faces of dead-and-gone de
charleus that looked down on us from the
dark paneled walls

  amedee de charleu was unusually hand-
some in this setting that seemed to suit
him so well i had not seen either him or
nita so brilliant and entertaining his ex-
treme consideration and courtesy to her
struck me afresh he anticipated her every
wish and mine and i was no more punc-
tilious in my acknowledgments than she

  it was a sort of revelation to me they
had been married ten years yet never for
an instant did they seem to fall into the
familiar and often careless habits which
so frequently characterize the conduct of
married people he might have been her
fiance for all the charming courtesy each
showed the other

  here was the ideal marriage i could not
refrain from remarking it

   merci madame he smiled it is
quite true wwere made for each other
his caressing black eyes rested on his wife
with a look that seemed to say  is it
not so but his smile struck me as
strained he dabbed his napkin at his mus-
tache to hide his mouth for the moment


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   it is wonderful-the ideal marriage
she answered  it would be a horror to
be married to the wrong one do you think
we shall go up the river to meet rex to-
morrow she spoke rapidly as though she
wished to change the subject  i do so
want eleanor to see his arrival it is a gor-
geous sight she turned gaily to me
 you will like it rex you know is king
of the carnival and is royally received he
is chosen by the clubs and must be a
wealthy man to support the great honor
rut no amount of wealth could buy that
honor

   which is fitting said de charleu  a
king must be of the blood or he must have
crossed the alps

   mistah rums am in de drawin-room
announced the negro butler

  there was a brief pause the woman
seemed to stiffen and the mans eyes flashed
with a peculiar glitter

   voulez-vous le voir he asked sharply

   non non mais jaissez mes excuses
she replied hesitatingly

   rurk tell mr rurns maclame will be
delighted to see him he looked steadily
at his wife as he spoke  we wfll join him
immediately

   yassir

   pardon me madame he turned to me
 we speak french together so much that
we sometimes forget comprenez vous
franais

   very little i answered in english
knowing he had insisted on his wife receiv-
ing this man against her inclination-and
realizing that he did not want me to know

  their entire attitude had changed de
charleu drank the black coffee hurriedly
and hastily excused himself

   you will join us soon he questioned
pleasantly but looking with pointed intent-
ness at his wife

   yes she replied briefly

   merci he smiled bowed to both of
us and hurried out

  an embarrassed silence followed

   susan tell mammy i want her nita
said constrainedly

  -my mind went back four years to that
summer in atlantic city when i had first
met this fascinating little creole and the

haodsome lover-husband who always hov-
ered near responding to her slightest glance
with some expression of affection there
had been times however when the glitter-
ing black eyes of the man would startle
me i could not credit the thought at such
times that amedee de charleu watched his
wife

  i had always been at a loss to under-
stand her violent fancy for me-her deter-
mination to have me visit her i was won-
dering about this and the curious scene
that had been enacted a few moments be-
fore when again i was struck by her strange
regarding of her hands one might almost
fancy they were somehow objects of loath-
ing to her

  an old negress waddled in

   what do mammys baby want now
she scolded lovingly

   mammy this is miss eleanor it is
one of their customs to introduce a guest
by the first name to the servants

   how y-all is mis eleanor mammy
smiled graciously

   i wanted to tell you not to wait up
for me to-night nita continued then
turned to me in the feverish w-ay that
seemed natural to her now though i had
not noticed it four years ago except on
occasions  come she said  we are for-
getting our guest good night mammy

   good night honey mammy replied
y-all know youah ol mammy cant
sleep till her little lamb am safe in bed

  i found mr rurns a rough-mannered
loud-voiced man who gave ones hand a
vigorous squeeze then opened his own as
if loath to deliver the remains amedee
de charleu was effusively friendly but it
somehow did not ring true and in spite of
nitas graciousness to her guest i could see
that she detested him

   i came over to ask you-all to go up the
river on my yacht to-morrow to see rex
come in he said cordially when the for-
malities were over

   thank you nita spoke hastily  but
i fear my guest would find it a bore after
all rex is but a man and his boat is but a
boat

  i looked at her in surprise as she de-
liberately contradicted the wish she had ex-
whose hands



pressed but a few moments before her
eyes were bright her cheeks flushed as
though she labored under some extreme
excitement

   on the contrary said de charleu in
his soft drawl  i fancy madamc would
enjoy it immensely- it is one of the
sights

  he turned to me as if appealing for con-
firmation embarrassed i hesitated nita
at once came to my rescue in her charming
way

   you are right she replied brightly
 i forgot for the moment that she is a
stranger she turned to mr burns  we
accept with pleasure you are most kind
to think of us and now you will excuse
us she rose as she spoke i have prom-
ised to show madame the sights for a little
while this evening and we must be dress-
ing or we shall not get anywhere she has
had a long journey and will want to retire
early

   ill take you in my car burns said
eagerly

   no indeed you will not you most kind
man nita cried laughingly  see new
orleans for the first time in a modern con-
veyance it would be sacrilege and be-
fore he could protest further she had flashed
out of the room i followed more slowly

  nita sent susan the maid who had
served us at dinner to assist me

   show miss eleanor to the blue room
she said to the girl who led the way up-
stairs

  as susan and i were quite near the
second landing i looked down in time to
see mammy come out of a room further up
the hall she held out her arms nita
ran into them and seemed to fairly crumple
on the old womans bosom

  my room was large and cold but mag-
nificently furnished the walls may at
some time have been blue now they were
dark and quite devoid of color the great
canopied four-post bed that stood in one
corner must have been put in before the
room was finished as never by any chance
could it have come in by the door a hand-
some old dresser a large wardrobe a quaint
little commode and a what-not some stiff
tapestry chairs one rocker a marble-top

table and a modern writing-desk completed
this room of dismal old world splendor

  the wardrobe alone would haye made
any room in my tiny flat look crowded
not to mention the bed here the room
looked barren almost empty a poor fire
tried hard to brighten the scene

  when my hostess and i were again in
the picturesque family carriage with old
uncle jesse as driver and guide with the
bright flowers and brighter faces about us
that mocked decay the depression of the
great dark house lifted from me and the
lazy drowsy singing breezes sweet as musk
laid hold of me a thrilling torture

  romance seemed lurking in every vine-
draped arbor under every moss-hung oak
even as tragedy stalks the very streets them-
selves

  quaint old stone strucures stood like
sentinels in courtyards whose magnificence
was guarded by high brick walls over which
the sweet olive sent its fragrant breath the
umbrella chinaberry the magnolia and the
flowering mulberry flaunted their scorn of
prison walls and sent out long arms of deli-
cious coolness to shelter the sun-stricken
streets

  occasionally one caught a glimpse of
dark flashing eyes from behind heavy wood-
en shutters little negroes who sat about
pounding bricks into dust spied us with
their quick eyes and ran out holding dirt
little sacks high above their small tabby
heads

    please missis buy a bag o rednin for
your banquette

   white teeth glistened in oily-brown faces
and black eyes snapped as they caught the
coins we tossed to them and they went
back to their occupation seldom recollecting
to deliver the merchandise

  even here in this more quiet part of the
city the spirit of pleasure charged in ram-
pant glory french voices chattered on
their highest notes and shrieked with laugh-
ter at anything or nothing flowered mus-
lins and silks and brilliant ribbons pro-
claimed their best dress-and the young
made love openly

   ah here we are at the famous old
french market nita was saying  driye
close to the banquette uncle jesse


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  we made out way under the vast low
weather-beaten shed through bawling ven-
dors of the seasons products past the odor-
olfc fish and meat stalls to a fragrant spot
near the early fruits we sat down on little
wooden benches against big square posts
with long mirrors at our backs a little
octoroon ran forward asking if we would
have coffee au lait or coffee non

  french english spanish and creple-
the latter a compound of the first three-
mingled in a confusing babble with shrill
cries and joyous laughter

  old carriages and the modern car passed
us sitting there watching what was to me
the strangest scene in america we drank
strong coffee and nibbled rice-cakes and
 stage-planks new york seemed very
far away

  negroes octoroons and whites crowded
around nita each trying to give her some
of his wares directly the market-house
folk began hurriedly and silently to disperse
as by a sudden word or sign of mutual con-
sent i turned in some surprise

  de charleu stood just behind me how
he had found us he did not say nita did
not ask it was plain to see that the market
folk felt none of the warmth toward him
that they had evinced at sight of his wife
i wondered in a vague way how he had got
rid of his guest so as to reach the market
almost as soon as we did and whether he
had come on purpose to meet us

  he helped us into the carriage then took
the vacant seat beside uncle jesse he
faced back toward us however and began
to talk in his easy way the while his eyes
left my face now and again in quick flashes
at his wife he pointed out quaint shops
antique stores and old mansions telling
me many pretty legends about them and
curious superstitions

   there is the haunted house once occu-
pied by louis philippe and also by lafay-
ette he said  one of them still occupies
it he laughed

   but surely the de charleus havent-
i began

   a ghost we have a legend and a curse
we are pursued by a pair of fantom
hands he said lightly  nearly two hun-
dred years ago a de charleu cut off his

  young wifes hands because he saw them
caressing another mans head with the
aid of her old nurse she committed suicide
the count her husband buried her in the
court because she was unworthy to lie in
the vault with his people

   he built the fountain over her to sig-
nify his overflowing joy that she had left
no children to reign over the house of de
charleu he was the first to see the fan-
tom hands they followed him every-
where haunted tortured him until he
hanged himself in his room after leaving
in a note the prophetic curse that has fol-
lowed us

   it was a long time before they were
seen again then one night they appeared
to one of the de charleus he had blown
out the candle and retired and they were
suddenly on the wall-white as marble
against the blackness of the room the next
day he killed his best friend over a game
of cards and shot himself after he realized
what he had done

   from that time on the hands have al-
ways appeared before a tragedy in the fam-
ily usually they have signified that the
one to whom they appeared would with
his own hands do a cruel murder not al-
ways but they meant at least death by
violence

   my own great-grandfather saw them
and killed his wife and himself his eyes
were on nitas face not mine and they
seemed to hold a menace  and he
added significantly  it has been our cus-
tom this past century to choose some gala
time for a family tragedy-as if we would
end with laughter in spite of the curse
we are always on the watch for it when
the city is in full dress

   you surely do not believe such- i
began

  he shrugged his shoulders  i must
the history of our family is in the proof
is it not so ma chere he said to nita
who sat curiously rigid beside me his
eyes glittered strangely even while he
smiled and his lightly spoken words had
an ugly sound

  here was somehow the key to nitas
regard of her hands just what the relation
might be i was at a loss to understand
whose hands



hers were no fantom hands certainly but
whatever it was de charleu held the key
and i felt that he used it as a means of
torture like a knife in the hands of a cruel
small boy

  we dropped him at canal street where
the crowds were so great that we moved
with difficulty lights blazed in long fes-
toons down the long streets

  i was surprised several times to see my
host in our neighborhood and in the most
unexpected moments always he appeared
unconscious of our presence if nita ever
saw him she gave no sign but talked on

  once when we stopped to let a crowd of
maskers pass a young man of perhaps thir-
ty with fair hair and keen gray eyes
threaded his way to us nita introduced
him as m randolph he talked to me
with the inquisitive courtesy of the south-
erner toward a stranger but his eyes dwelt
on nita in a fashion that left no room for
doubt as to his feelings for the brilliant
little woman

  i caught myself watching her for some
answering sign on her vivid dark face
there was none she chatted along gaily
indifferently about many things then sud-
denly i felt her stiffen i looked up and
following her eyes found de charleu com-
ing toward us

  ah m randolph he cried extend-
ing his hand in great cordiality on reaching
the carriage  i hear you are doing big
things eh 

  the young man made an embarrassed
gesture of dissent and de charleau turned
to me

   m randolph is one of our brilliant
young attorneys he avill be our next con-
gressman from this district he seemed
to say it in the tone of one who wishes to
entertain a guest and compliment a friend
 he is a young man of great charm and
promise once he wished to be my deadly
rival and deprive me of my countess-
mais -de charleu shrugged his shoulders
- those things are arranged for us and
so it was destined he shall lose her and i
win he laughed softly  now he is my
friend but i suspect he would not weep if
i am laid beside my ancestors for which
i do not blame him

  de charleus black eyes turned with ador-
ation toward his lovely wife as if to say
 but look at her and you will see he is
not to blame

  his words and manner were light almost
frivolous his white teeth were exposed in a
good-humored smile and redolent with flat-
tery toward his wife but somehow back of
all there seemed something sinister

  nita accepted the implied compliment
with a little forced laugh

  randolph flushed under the creoles
words but his own smile did not waver
he retorted with some pleasant banter for
de charleu a compliment for madame and
left us in a few moments

  i was curiously shocked by the scene it
seemed in bad taste at best and so out of
keeping with my suave courteous host who
also left us directly saying he was going up
to the club

  nitas eyes that had grown absent as
we trailed along again drifted out of space
to her own limp hands she studied them
for a long while then apropos of nothing
began to tell me about young randolph
as if she thought she must explain her
husbands words

   we were in love with each other as
boy and girl she said her dark face flush-
ing noticeably under the lights  i mar-
ried amedee by my fathers request before
he died and never since my marriage have
we m randolph and i exchanged a word
except in public have you ever been
greatly in love eleanor she asked a
catch in her voice then she went on to
speak with the passionate frankness of her
people

  in this sweet warm palpitating land of
the creoles where the very breath is love
they have none of our reticence about dis-
cussing matters of the heart but as we
are ashamed of love so they are ashamed
of divorce

  in the course of a gay evening full of
shifting scenes nita seemed to forget her
disturbing thoughts

  it was almost twelve when she turned
to me contrition in her big dark eyes

   but i am a sorry hostess to forget how
tired you must be  she exclaimed  uncle
jesse drive home at once


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   ob i love it  i cried r it is no won-
der your women marry at fifteen and six-
teen and your men are lovers from the
cradle to the grave cupid is in the air
do you not feel the brush of his wings to-
night-

   no-not that she said absently and
all at once a vague dread a feeling of im-
pending something began to lay hold of me
i almost wished myself out of this gay city
with its undercurrent of tragedy and super-
stition

  on reaching my room at last i stepped
out of a long french window and found
myself on a balcony that ran all around
and overhung a big square court all the
rooms gave upon this great space and sev-
eral straight stairways led from the two
balconies directly to the ground

  to my overwrought imagination it seemed
as if i stood before a monster vault and that
the balconies were shelved for storing the
bodies a full white moon aided the illu-
sion by casting weird shadows on a fountain
standing like some huge ghost in the center
and i thought of the young countess lying
there alone for more than a century

   you baf am ready i jumped at the
sound of susans voice  dems the ser-
yants quarters she continued smiling and
pointing directly across the court  all but
mammys-she sleep down-stairs nex to
mis nita her maw done tell mammy to
take care o her when mis nita was a little
baby and mammy she mos lak mis nitas
own maw

  i could not sleep and dragged a chair
out on the balcony where i could watch the
low-hung moon that dimmed the sparkle of
the stars thrilling exalting torturing with
its flood of mellow light the distant
sounds of revelry reached me faintly drift-
ing up with the odor of honeysuckle and the
penetrating sweetness of the night-blooming
cereus as the flowers sleep not so new
orleans during the mardi gras

  it was three oclock when i finally blew
out my light and sank luxuriously into my
bed of soft down i was very tired but
the strong coffee made me wakeful and i
was restlessly tossing about when a loud
piercing scream rang through the old rooms
it was a fearful cry

  i sat up in bed straining in the dark-
ness the blood rushing in my ears was
all i heard i got up lighted my lamp and
waited for-i knew not what not a sound
broke the stillness

  i went out on the balcony the ser-
vants quarters were dark gathering up
my feeble courage i slipped down-stairs
nobody was stirring clearly i was the
only one in all that household who had
heard that this was so seemed unbeliev-
able it somehow filled me with unspeak-
able dread the walls creaked and i
jumped and looked quickly behind me i
should not have been at all surprised had
a de charleu ghost stalked in

  uneasy and yet angry at myself for
yielding my modern mind to the insidious
atmosphere of superstition i finally lay
down and left the lamp burning

  the morning found me tired and worn
susan brought my petite dejeuner and was
as smiling as usual

  cautiously i mentioned being wakeful
and hearing a noise  was any one sick
in the night i asked i saw at once that
she too had heard that scream

   ah spec hit was de ghos she sai-
after some thought

   what ghost

   lady marie she stay in de room nex
to yourn did hit soun close or-down-
stairs she asked cunningly

  seeing i was on forbidden ground i pre-
tended not to hear

   cause ef hit was down-stairs hit mus
a been mammy susan went on deter-
mined to put my mind at rest  she was
mos possible havin one of her nightmares
she plumb full of nightmares dat op
woman is

  i smiled as though satisfied but susan
was not she fussed around my room sev-
eral minutes after she was through serving
me split some pine fat into kindling though
there was plenty cut and put the little
hatchet that was part of the fireplace equip-
ment carefully in place with the poker and
tongs finally it came out

   hit worries mis nita dem nightmares
of mammys susan said  mis nita
am powerful lovin and she am scared
mammy mought die and maybe so she
whose hands



didnt wake up and wont know nothin
bout hit unless you tells her

   i wont tell her susan i said and
with a broad expanse of white teeth she
went out

  de charleu and nita were pleasant and
he was charmingly affectionate as usual at
breakfast no mention was made of that
horrid scream of the night before i might
almost have been inclined to think it a
dream but i knew i had not been asleep
besides susan had heard it too why had
she not got up or called some one
and why had she been so anxious that i
should not mention it to nita and why
were so many things in this house

   have you ever turned a cup nita
asked gaily as we lingered over the table
de charleu had left us alone

   oh yes lots of times i answered
 but i use tea grounds

   coffee grounds are better she as-
sured me seriously  mammy is wonder-
ful at reading them susan tell her we
want her to read our fortunes

  she began to talk in her bright rapid
way of the carnival the while we drained
away our coffee leaving only the grounds
then he turned the cups three times above
our heads making a wish and set them
top side down in the saucers

   you go long honey mammy smiled
as she ambled in  yo-all know dey aint
no truf in dem grouns

  mammy politely took my cup first  ah
sees some money in de cup an a surprise
you is gwine to git a letter foh long devs
a little sickness ahead of you an a long
trip

 i suspect im going home i laughed
 yassim ah spec you is dah it is
plain as daylight she said  deys gwine
to be a big crowd round you an a heap of
talk too an folks laughin sho is

   that will happen to-day i smiled
dr richard the old family physician
dropped in during the fortune telling nita
introduced him and i recollected what she
had said  le pauvre docteur is an infi-
del mammy continued my fortune with
many amusing platitudes i was rather
astonished to see that the doctor did not
look upon this mild pastime as amusing

but seemed to regard it with distinct dis-
favor

    rot perfect rot he sputtered

  oh no but it is not m le doc-
teur cried nita seriously  for how can
you explain-

   explain anything can be explained
he broke in it seemed to me more bruskly
than the occasion demanded  there is
no supernatural thing in life that common
sense cant explain he said rising  come
to my office as soon as the carnival is over
ive made up my mind to have aserious
talk with you young woman i dont work
during the carnival though nobody
does

  he winked at me but i felt that he was
serious after he went out mammy took
up nitas cup and stared jong into it

   hits bout de same honey she said
gravely

   are they there mammy the little
woman asked eagerly

   yes honey

  nitas dark eager face seemed suddenly
to sag all over she stared vacantly at an
old portrait whose faded face had a ghast-
ly hue a deathwatch ticked loudly in
the stillness a mouse squeaked behind
the wainscot-and mr burns was an-
nounced

 ii

  as we had planned we went to meet
rex king of the carnival on mr burnss
boat

  no royal personage was ever more gra-
ciously received from the time his craft
was sighted three miles up the river until f
he landed was a deafening roar of cannon
a clanging of bells and blowing of whis-
tles the big golden key to the city was
handed him as he stepped ashore and new
orleans was figuratively and literally wide
open

  we followed him from the river and up-
town as far as st charles street

  everybody seemed to go mad the pa-
rade was an imposing military affair and
lasted all day

  in the evening canal street seemed lift-
ed out of some fairy tale music mingled
with laughter gay buntings fluttered


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  everywhere and myriads of varicolored
  lights shone on the gorgeous floats and the
  merry maskers

    we watched this wild revelry-this sea
  of surging pushing laughing swaying hu-
  manity from the balcony of-pickwick club
  which is reserved for the families of mem-
  bers other balconies are improvised to
  seat thousands across the front of every
  business house but the streets catch the
  great overflow

    i was watching a masked knight in the
   cave of the winds who waved gaily to
  us all at once his arm dropped and he
  seemed to draw himself up taut as steel
  under the head of a monster serpent at
  that moment mr burns bent vver nita
  and her pointed nails cut sharply into the
  flesh of my arm

    the now-disappearing knight did not
  look our way again nitas hands were like
  ice and her nerves were aquiver

     who was the knight in the cave of
  the winds i asked

  amedee she whispered

    after the parade we made our way to
  rexs ball even the queen in all the
  crown jewels was not more radiant than
  this exquisite little creole in a gown of
  orange tissue and old lace when the
  grand march was over we slipped out to
  attend a private reception given in honor
  of the royal visitors

    i had grown accustomed to nitas sud-
  den changes but i could not make her out
  to-night she was glorious dazzling
  gay but with a gaiety that made me feel
  like tears and twice i caught her studying
  her hands

    may i have a dance asked
 a pleasant voice at my elbow and i
 handed my program to young randolph
 he looked very handsome in evening dress
 his fair head showing to advantage among
 so many dark ones inita he said hesi-
 tatingly to my hostess who stood beside
 me  maynt i have one

    she seemed to waver i looked away as
  though interested in a distant couple

     it is ten years since he spoke very
  low for her ears only

     there was another instant of hesitation
  then the music struck up and i heard her

say  come there was a note of reck-
lessness in her voice

  randolphs arm closed around her as if
hungry for the feel of her slim form and
i wondered what they would say to each
other in the public privacy of the dance-
these two who had loved so greatly and
had not spoken together in private for ten
years

  de charleu claimed me for that dance
he was abstracted silent and i realized
for the first time that he was actually
homely that only his splendid animation
made him appear handsome his brilliant
black eves and flashing teeth distracted
ones attention from the chin and lips that
were unpleasant in repose

  it was nearly four oclock when he es-
corted xita and me home he went back
to the club

  mammy met us on the first landing
 ah had de water on for an hour honey
an ah started drippin you coffee jus as
soon as ah heard you-all cornin down de
street

   you dont mind if i come up with
you nita asked as mammy left us
there was an exhilaration in her eyes and
voice-a sort of high-tensioned reckless
happiness

   by all means come up i said

  soon mammy bustled into my room with
the coffee things a door slammed some-
where in the house and nita started up in
fright then settled down again

   the family ghost she laughed  i
hope she has not disturbed you

  i thought of my first night in that room
but i felt that she was watching me and
answered  not at all i hope she will pay
me a visit before i go home

   dont say that she whispered the
eyes she turned on me showed how horrible
to her was even the thought of a visit from
the spirit lady  you think me foolish
she smiled in an effort at self-recovery
 has susan come in yet mammy she
asked absently

   nom honey dat nigger gal aint got
no sense o time nor nuttin else when de
mardi gras am gwine on she done lef
tom and got a new man she git a new
one every mardi gras god send
whose haxds



  nita heaved a heavy sigh put her hands
up to her eyes as if to shut out something
then asked suddenly

   do you believe in warnings

  no and surely you dont

   the de charleus have always known
when a great tragedy has hung over them
she replied gravely  they have always
been warned of its approach yet they have
never been able to avert it

   then what is the good of the warn-
ing

   i dont know perhaps there is a way
if one could only find it if one only
could there was a far-away look in
her eyes  the curse-if it could be lift-
ed-if it only could but it cant no
not so long as there is a de charleu liv-
ing

  there was a long pause i waited for
her to speak but her eyes simply drifted
back out of space to her own limp hands
and i was forgotten

   not so long as there is one she re-
peated

   are there many i asked softly

   he is the only one the absence
that looked out of her eyes now trailed
into her voice though she answered my
question she was plainly talking to her-
self

   your husband

   yes and there is an old prophecy
that says  the man shall pay his debt to
the woman and the house of de charleu
shall fall by the hand of a woman-a wo-
man who is a de charleu but not of the
blood i am the first not of the de char-
leu blood to see the fan tom hands and
they have appeared to me only in the cof-
fee grounds mammy saw them three
years after i was married

  in a flash of horror i understood her
tragic contemplation of her hands also
i recalled de charleus story of the legend
and the menace in his voice

   but you say it w-as mammy who saw
them i suggested when i could trust my-
self to speak

   true  a new and staggering thought
seemed to hold her for a moment  but
no they are always in my cup

  she got up suddenly some one was

moving below  it is amedee i must
go good night dear if i should die to-
night she whispered as she kissed me  i
have had one little minute of happiness
and it is worth whatever comes after-in
this world or the next

  when she had gone i sat pondering over
the hideous situation of this woman her
evident fear of her fate and of herself and
the gruesome fact that de charleu knew
and seemed to foster the horrid notion
which i was now convinced he did not even
believe else he would not have dared use
it to torture her as he undoubtedly did
also i wondered over the curious nature of
the passionate creole who would pay here
and hereafter for one moment of love and
happiness yet is such a slave to race tra-
ditions that a young girl may be disposed
of in marriage by her family and divorce
for any cause whatsoever is unknown

  i was in a state of cold terror unable to
go to sleep-waiting for-the development
of nitas words perhaps when the morn-
ing dawned and nothing had happened i
was inclined to be vexed at myself the
morbid atmosphere was fastening its sub-
tle fangs of suggestion on my twentieth-
century mind

iii

  the carnival spirit still hovered over us
when the eve of the lenten season arrived
on the morrow the gay city must put on
sackcloth and ashes and do penance for
the sins of the past year-and especially
those of the past fortnight

  nita did not appear at breakfast my
host spoke lightly of her absence

   she begs you will excuse her this morn-
ing he said she is quite worn out-too
much festivity he laughed  i am to be
your guide to-day she will join us this
afternoon at the old absinthe house at
one time the headquarters of the famous
pirate lafitte you must not miss it and
there is the cabildo where the transfer
was made of a land that was an empire in
itself

  i pleaded a headache and would not go
with him somehow i had come to loathe
his white-toothed smile his glowing black
eyes and soft drawling voice besides


argosy and railroad mans magazine

my mind was deeply concerned over nita
 could not imagine her volcanic vitality
slumping like this

  mammy was clearly disposed not to let
me into her mistresss room but i was de-
termined she lay propped up high on her
big canopied bed with its lace draperies
and mosquito netting back of her i
paused shocked her face was haggard
her eyes-almost insane it seemed to me
 nita i cried  what is it

   oh i cant keep it from you she said
 i have abbut reached the end of my
strength what do you think i did last
night i sat on the floor all night my ear
pressed against the door waiting for my
husband to come home and kill me

   sank down on the foot of her bed un-
able to speak

   mammy was with me she always is
nita went on  i think amedee loved me
once she said in a low voice that some-
how frightened me  hut when he knew
for a certainty that the de charleu curse
had fallen on me he grew suddenly to
watch me and hate me he is always cour-
teous and devoted when in company but
when we are alone- she shuddered
 those scenes those wretched scenes
he gets out his big hunting-knife and
sharpens it and taunts me and tells me
how he will wipe out the curse with my
blood if i do not have a care

   my god i cried

   i would not tell you she half sobbed-
 but i feel that the end is near and be-
sides i have kept silent for seven years
i must speak or i shall die her words
tumbled out  i was sixteen when i mar-
lied him and i did not know what to do
her voice rose  he followed me about
the streets stepping out of sight in door-
ways and alleys until i was almost mad

   at last i quit going out except when he
could bewth me then he brought his
friends to the house and compelled me to
receive them and if he thought he de-
tected undue warmth in my manner-how
can i speak of the awful nights that have
followed when i would sit waiting for him
to come back break in and kill me

  now her voice sank to a shuddering
whisper  i began at last to wonder when

it would happen i could picture the whole
awful thing i knew just what h would
do it with-that awful hunting-knife
she sat up straight  i hoped  would not
struggle and make him scar my face

  she drew a deep gasping breath and her
eyes had a wild look in them she
streiched her arms in front of her as if to
push something from her

   i could see my body as it lay in the
drawing-room in my high-necked robes
i saw the people come and go then i fol-
lowed myself to the vault in the old ceme-
tery oh the horror of that vault with
those dead and gone de charleus and
the darkness she fell back on her pil-
lows  at this point i would seem to go
mad i would wish that i could put him
there and stay myself in the light-the
beautiful light at last it has taken pos-
session of me she spread her hands and
spoke resignedly then sat up rigidly

    think of it constantly i picture it
over and over again and i am always glad
glad when the great iron doors of the vault
close on him and  am free from the daily
horror that hangs over me there was a
hectic light on her drawn face

   i do not want to do it my whole
soul and body revolts against it i have
talked with the priest about my unhappi-
ness though i have not told him of my
fears he good man cannot give his con-
sent that i leave my husband

  she stopped suddenly i was too horri-
fied to speak

   lately he has lost large sums at gam-
bling and one night he put up the old
house-and lost it the man who won it
told amedee that we could continue to live
in it on condition that he introduce him
into our set it was then that the real
tragedy began amedee conceived the idea
of setting a trap for the man i was to en-
courage his attentions and when he de-
clared himself i was to ask for amedees
written promise of the house i refused at
first-and myhusband said he would kill
me he got out his knife-it had been
newly sharpened and-i-promised him

   he often leaves us that man and me
alone together oh it is a nightmare i
am almost mad last night at the recep-
whose hands



tion the man took me into the conserva-
tory and declared his love for me i was
in a panic if i refused him too suddenly
i would lose the home and amedee would
kill me if i accepted his caresses and
amedee learned of it he was just as likely
to kill me

   for curious as it may seem he is in-
sanely jealous of me and of every one who
looks at me i tried to think of a way
suddenly i went to pieces and told the
man i loathed him-i saw a movement
among a group of palms near me-and
amedee came out from behind them when
the man had left me and-well i have
promised to get the papers to-night i do
not know if i can

  she stopped speaking and lay back on
her pillows i went and took her in my
arms

   dont pity me she said  i could
not bear it

   im going to take you to new york
with me to-morrow i said

  she sat up frightened  oh i could
not go he would not let me

   he is not going to know when or where
you go

   oh but he would find out besides-
the church-the disgrace none of ray
family have been in any scandal and he
would follow us

  finding that further talk but excited
her i left her with mammy who came in
bringing a julep to brace her for the ordeal
of this last night of festivity-and some-
thing more

  but i made up my mind that with the
assistance of dr richard and young ran-
dolph i would put amedee de charleu
where he could not harm his wife

  the afternon and evening seemed end-
less somehow nita under mammys skil-
ful hand and by the aid of her own ter-
rific pride managed to recover her dyna-
mic vivacity none could have guessed the
horror she had come through only the night
before she did not mention it to me again
and i felt that she already regretted her
burst of confidence they have no lip
pride these creoles but it is deep in the
hearts of them buried in every grave writ
on every tomb

  that night when i saw her beckon to
burns who had received an invitation to
the dwyer ball through the de charleus
i turned sick her smile was perfectly
done i had to go out on the balcony for
air returning in a few minutes to the
ballroom i looked everywhere for nita and
burns nor could i find de charleu
after a while she came in on the arm of
burns and her face was so bright so gay
that i thought she must have succeeded
without any unpleasant complications i
had not estimated the fulness of her proud
control

  that night when we returned home with
my fears temporarily allayed by her man-
ner and my determination to start some ac-
tion for her on the following day i sank
into a deep sleep almost as soon as i
touched my bed

  suddenly i was roused to full conscious-
ness by a loud piercing scream  a second
and third followed in quick succession
there were two voices and they came from
the direction of nitas room i dont know
how i got down the dark stairs but all at
once i found myself at her door it was
open no one was there so i ran to mam-
mys room from which i now heard hid-
eous moans

  how can i describe the sight that met
my eyes at that door

  there in the pale lamplight crouched
against the wall in an attitude of abject
terror stood nita her head was bent as if
to ward off a blow her arms were half ex-
tended as though she sought to push them
from her her hands hung limp-those
frail blue-veined hands that had always
seemed so fascinatingly useless i fol-
lowed her stricken gaze to the fireplace
and there on the floor lay amedee de char-
leu-dead

  mammy was huddled in a heap on the
further side of the room  oh lawd
amighty she moaned oh lawd
amighty she rocked from side to side

 nita mammy oh my god i
cried

   ah nevah meant to done hit mammy
pleaded looking up at me for the first time
ah nevah meant to done hit she kept
repeating over and over


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   mammy what are you saying i
grasped her shoulder and shook her

   ah never mearit to done hit lawd

	lawd you knows ah never and
that was all she would say nita seemed
to shrink further and further against the
wall while she kept horrified eyes on the
form of her husband and continued to hold
her hands away from her  sank on a
near-by chair too weak to stand my
mind was paralyzed i could not think of
anything to do but sit and look upon the
awful scene before me

  never once did the old negress cease her
low moans  ah never meant to done
hit

  at last i roused myself  nita nita

	cried come away i took hold of
her and for the first time her eyes left that
ghastly thing on the floor she looked at
me in a dazed way and let me lead her to-
ward the door when we reached the hall
mammy rose with a scream

   great gawd amighty you-all aint
gwine to leave me wid dat thing she
cried in a frenzy of terror running out
after us and slamming the door behind her

   mammy  commanded  stop that
screeching and wake the servants

   oh nom ah has to go thru dat dark
cout and mars amedees ghost gwine to
git me shore

   ill go i replied  you stay with
your mistress we must notify the au-
thorities

   de police

  yes of course

   oh mis eleanor does you think
deyll hang me oh blessed mother ah
never meant to done hit

  nita sat quite still always with her
hands held away from her hanging in that
peculiar droop

  mammys wailing voice followed me
across the great dark indoor garden to
the servants quarters and sent waves of
horror over me

  the negroes fled in panic i phoned
dr richard and then we three women sat
huddled miserably waiting in nitas room
with the thought of that awfwl thing in the
one adjoining us and the sound of revelry
coming to us - those sounds that would

cease only with the dawn of lent it some-
how brought home to me lifes great drama
of suffering and dying within sound of
laughter and song

  mammy kept moaning at wide intervals
nitas eyes roamed about in a way that in-
creased my nervousness suddenly she be-
gan to speak it was as if she thought
aloud without realizing that her lips gave
utterance

  i had to get it she murmured
 what was i to do she turned to me
suddenly and her words came so fast that
i could hardly catch them  i had to get
it-the paper of which i told you so in
desperation i made a clean breast of the
whole thing and threw myself on  burnss
mercy it was then that i learned how
good a crude rough man may be how in-
finitely more the heart of a man counts
than his breeding

   he was wild at amedee he got up
and stamped about calling my husband all
sorts of names it warmed my heart but
i was in a panic because i did not know
what he would do i humbled myself
 please i said  give me the paper he
will kill me if you do not then  turned
to see-amedee

   mr burns saw him too and he walked
up to my husband and with words of most
deadly insult handed him the paper hit-
ting him in the face with it as he did so
then he took me back to the ballroom
and amedee did not dare to resent

  i thought of her as i saw her enter that
room laughing and talking gay and bril-
liant and i wondered at the deeps of the
frivolous-seeming latin

  so busy had i been with watching tier
that i had not noticed her companion
now i recalled the grim look that was
upon his face

   amedee had been drinking heavily
she went on  and when we were in our
room he told me i had reached the end
i had disgraced him and the de charleu
family with calm cold voice and glit-
tering eyes he said he was going to send
me to meet them he drew out his knife
deliberately oh my god she threw
her arms over her head

  then all at once she began to scream
whose hands



nor could mammy and i quiet her dr
richard arriving in a few minutes admin-
istered a hypodermic and directly she fell
asieep

  new orleans whose very history is writ-
ten in blood was deeply stirred the de
charleus were so prominent and every-
body apparently knew about the curse that
was believed by many to follow the
family

  young randolph phoned me to meet
him at his office he was distracted for
nita but would not go to the house he
wanted all the details from me first hand
and took no pains to hide his love

   they took her from me damn them
he said  but they cant take my love from
her tell her that please mrs warren
and that i stand ready to help her if im
needed and tell her -he hesitated and
seemed embarrassed -  that - nothing
under heaven or in hell can change my
feelings for her-that-no matter what-
shes done-i justify her and love her and
will go to hell to serve her

  a slow dark red suffused his face and
with a shock i realized that he believed
what i had not allowed my mind to formu-
late-that nita de charleu had killed her
husband

  in a state bordering on collapse i re-
turned to that house of horror to find that
dr richard had taken xita to his private
sanatorium susan the only servant beside
mammy who had not run away told me
that when xita waked up she began wring-
ing her hands and whispering to herself
susans eyes rolled with terror

  officers were already in charge of the
death chamber

  mammys story was simple she had
killed her master she had used a hatchet
that she always had in the room for split-
ting kindling she kept it on the hearth
he was drinking he came in and started
at her with a knife for scorching one of his
best shirts she had the hatchet in her
hand when he came at her to beat her and
she struck out never thinking of what she
had in her hand

   had he ever beaten you before she
was asked

   yas sir heaps of times and dis time

    	argosy

he come at me wid a knife dat knife you
found by him side

   why did he beat you and go after you
with a knife at that time of night over a
shirt asked the coroner glancing at a
large hunting-knife he had found by the
body

   he was layin it out for mawnin oh
gentlemen you aint gwine to put de black
cap on my haid is you an a rope aroun
mah neck and squeeze my eyes out is
you ah never meant to done hit-deed
ah didnt

  the one weak spot in her testimony was
that the scorched shirt could not be found
nor could mammy give any account of it

  the old woman was bound over for the
grand jury without bail and i was held as
a witness i moved to a quiet hotel up-
town somehow i could not endure the old
city that had so fascinated me at first

  i was besieged by xitas friends black
and white for some explanation-some
word from her dr richard allowed no
one to see her and i learned from him that
he was very anxious about her condition
young randolph was like a maniac he
became my shadow somehow he seemed
to feel that being with me brought him
nearer to her he offered his services to
defend mammy while dr richard and i
tried to make her as comfortable as possi-
ble by taking her delicacies daily but she
ate hardly at all her one thought was for
her  chile

  a true bill being found against her by
the grand jury i arranged bail for my ap-
pearance when court convened and went
home

ring forces and was both bright and mel-
ancholy

  mammys trial had been postponed on
account of nitas illness an officer had to
clear the entrance when nita entered the
court-room with dr richard

  fat old negro women in ample aprons
and kerchiefed heads young octoroons in
brilliant cotton gowns and sailor hats
dried-up old negro men in jeans and misfit
shoes with toes protruding and brawny
young men in dingy homespun crowded
against the walls of the court-room a mot-
ley fringe around the white friends that
filled the seats

  from my place down in front i leaned
eagerly forward i was shocked by nitas
face that looked so strained and white
against her somber black gown but glad
to see the light of reason in her big brown
eyes that immediately sought out mammy

-	 lemme git to ma chile white man
cried the old woman to a bailiff who re-
strained her owing to the fact that al-
most the entire court including the digni-
fied judge and prosecuting attorney were
intimate friends of the de charleus and
had been scolded and petted as little boys
by mammy she was not inclined to stand
in awe of or to  mind them

   impulsive passionately sympathetic the
crowd rose as if by common consent at
sight of nita order being restored the
tedious business of impaneling a jury
began

   randolph sat at a long table in front of
the judges stand i did not see him look
once in nitas direction nor did she look
at him the judge was pale and kept
turning the pages of a big book

  outside the sun grew hotter as the day
advanced and a lazy drowsy breeze swept
in through the windows without cooling
the air big palmetto and hand-painted
ivory fans in masculine and feminine
hands were going all over the sweltering
room a constant mass of choppy motion
that made one dizzy to watch

   at last the trial began

  the servants on examination admitted
reluctantly that the dead man had never
struck or even spoken crossly to any of
them they however had disliked him

for no reason that they could give what-
ever amedee de charleu had been to his
wife it was clear that he would not de-
mean himself by bickering with his ser-
vants

  witness after witness was called by the
prosecution to prove that de charleu had
been the soul of courtesy to black and
white-but in each case it came out that
nobody liked him mammys contention
of cruelty however was slowly crumbling
away clearly other motives were back of
the crime

  the following day i took the stand for
the defense i was in a panic lest under
cross-examination i would tell things that
i had determined they should not wring
from me convinced as i was that mam-
my was innocent of de charleus murder
i was still not disposed to turn suspicion
on the little woman who had suffered so
much at the dead mans hands i trusted
randolph to get mammy off somehow

   did you see the knife beside m de
charleus body when you first entered the
room asked william dorsey the prose-
cuting attorney when randolph had fin-
ished my examination for the defense

   yes i recollect seeing it i said
 though i didnt think of it at the time
 had you see that knife before in the
defendants room or in her possession
 i had not been in her room before that
night i said  and i had never seen any
knife in mammys possession

   had you ever noticed any ill-feeling
on the defendants part toward her mas-
ter he asked

   no she was always most respectful and
pleasant toward him

  had you any reason to believethat
the hatchet was kept in her room for ma-
licious purposes

  randolph rose with an objection which
was overruled

   no i had not i answered  the
hatchet was part of the fireplace equip-
ment used for splitting kindling on the
hearth

  i breathed a sigh of thankfulness when
told to stand down

  then mammy was called by randolph
she was a pitiable object her old black


whose hands

lace was ashen and great tears rolling
ceaselessly down her cheeks fell on her
ample bosom

   wept without shame as did many wo-
men in the court-room knowing that the
defendant need not testify i was surprised
that randolph would allow her to take the
stand since i knew his fears and how easy
it might be for a clever man like william
dorsey to trap the simple-minded old
woman

  but her testimony could not be shaken
she had killed her master over a scorched
shirt and she had burned the shirt
when asked why she had not told about
burning the shirt at the inquest she said
because she didnt see no use in telling
everything she knew at once she was
saving something for the big judge

   where did you keep the knife ordi-
narily questioned the prosecuting attor-
ney

  sudden wrath dried mammys tears

   willie she cried  you know ah aint
had dat knife how ahm gwine to keep
dat knife ordinarily when ah aint had hit
at all what you tryin to make out
you know dat aint mah knife jes as well
as ah do

  a laugh ran over the court and  wil-
lie  applied himself to the papers on the
table before him in her excitement mam-
my had forgotten the prefix cultivated after
dorsey had come back from college a
young man

  when mammy stepped down there was
one of those strange hushes that so often
go before some portentous moment a cu-
rious sense of waiting after a pause that
seemed age long but was in reality very
brief randolph turned to the judge i
expected as did everyone perhaps that
nila would now be called instead he
merely said  the defendant rests your
honor

   gentlemen of the jury dorsey began

  wait it was nitas voice sharp
high-pitched her slim black-robed figure
stood out strikingly against the white walls
of the court-room the judge looked at
her surprise and sympathy in his eyes

   wait nuttin cried mammy  jedge
you go on tend to your business



  the court rapped for order dr rich-
ard spoke to xita in a low voice but she
paid no attention to him everybody
looked uneasy and there was a whispering
and general restlessness randolphs fair
face was white and drawn

  xita extended her arms toward the
judge moistened her lips opened them-
but no sound came never have i seen any
one struggle so for speech a great lump
ached in my throat dr richard tried to
force her back into her chair she resisted
wordlessly when at last she spoke it
was only a tense whisper but it penetrated
every corner of that room

   they dont look like murderous hands
do they she turned her hands over
looking at them curiously  yet that is
what they are

  a gasp went over the court-room ran-
dolph jumped up the judge signed to
him he sank back and covered his face
with his hands

   yes those hands killed amedee de
charleu

  wonder and horror were in her voice
and in her eyes there was a shifting in
the jury box the crowd leaned forward
a woman cried out then there was si-
lence fans paused and it seemed as if
the very aii held its breath mammy sat
paralyzed

   it is the old story of the de charleu
curse nita went on directly  the man
has paid his debt to the woman and the
house of de charleu has fallen by her
hand

   taint so mammys shrill voice cut
the stillness like the crack of a whip
don you believe her jedge the old
woman tried to get out of the prisoners
chair  she sick-she mos crazy she
don know what shes talkin bout the
old woman went on excitedly

  be quiet mammy the judge com-
manded

   ah isnt gwine to be quiet till you
takes me out an hangs me ah done mur-
der mars amedee an ah aint never gwine
to be happy till ahs hung

  silence commanded the court

  ah wants to be hung ah tells you
the old woman was sobbing violently


argosy and railroad mans magazine

 ahs tired of foolin lak dis ah wants
to go home to glory

   mammy ill have you removed from
the court if youre not quiet and at last
she sat down

  the grim humor of her words was lost in
the tragic pathos of her self-immolation

  the court waited for xita to proceed
the prosecution made as if to speak

   let her tell her story in her own way
the judge said quietly

   amedee told me xita continued  as
soon as he knew we would have no chil-
dren that i was the woman a de char-
leu-but not of the blood by whose hand
the house must fall at first i would not
believe him mammy saw the fantom
hands in my cup and i knew it was true-
that the de charleu curse had fallen on
me

  a murmur of horror ran over the court

  xitas voice dropped so low that i could
hardly hear

	 he began to taunt me she whispered
 and say that i would never have a chance
to do it oh i was so afraid of him-
and of myself on the night of the-i-
the accident-

  she seemed unable to go on it was
hideous-this proud woman of a proud
race pilloried before these folk who had
known her from childhood baring her soul
to them

   something occurred xita brought
out at last  at the-dwyer ball-and
when we got home he said i had reached
the end he got out his big sharp cruel
bunting-knife-i-ran screaming to mam-
mys room there was a hatchet on the
hearth-before i knew what i was doing
i had snatched it up-and-i threw my
arms over my eyes and-struck out

   the next instant he tore the hatchet
from my hand mammy screamed and
he fell then i started screaming too i
think i did not look up i had no need
to i knew what i had done he had
been too late-and the prophecy was ful-
filled

  she broke down completely dr rich-
ard made her sit i went at once to her
and somebody gave me a seat there was
a subdued hubbub all over the court-room

the judge cleared his throat brushed back
his hair with a painful gesture and pulled
his sleeves carefully and exactly over his
cuffs

  randolph leaned on the attorneys
table like an old man i saw minutely as
one does in big moments

  mammy had tried to speak several times
and been silenced dr richard rose  i
wish to be sworn in he said quietly xo
objection was offered and the oath was
administered randolph looked as if noth-
ing mattered now

   i have had mme de charleu in my
sanatorium for several months past said
the doctor  i have had her under close
observation her confession comes as a
complete surprise to me but it is my in-
tention to point out to the honorable court
and to you gentlemen of the jury that
mme de charleu has been caught and
swept ruthlessly along by the most power-
ful force known to man-suggestion

  again the fans stopped waving there
was a breathless hush and randolph
looked up eagerly i doubt if xita heard
him she was weeping in my arms

   for over a century he continued
 the de charleu family has been under
the curse of insanity the very root of
which was suggestion the countess ma-
rie in dying more than a century ago
promised that she would be avenged on her
husbands house this was the first sug-
gestion then the nature of the gruesome
deed carried with it the second suggestion
of fantom hands that sought constantly to
destroy the family

   and the crime being committed against
a woman a de charleu not oj the blood
in the first place gives us the last link in
this deadly chain of suggestion which has
been handed down from father to son ac-
cumulating its own proof gathering force
generation after generation and finally
reaching its culmination in amedee de
charleu

  he went on to speak briefly and authori-
tatively on the subject of thought as a great
motive power and particularly on the ac-
tion of mind over mind citing case after
case to prove his premise strong men
had been made ill by suggestion there
whose hands



was even one case on record which told of
a death caused by suggestion pure and
simple

   the realization that he was the last of
his line the physician continued  to-
gether with the old prophecy undoubtedly
fostered the seeds of insanity in de char-
leus mind he in turn planted like seeds
in mammys credulous superstitious mind
and she naturally thought she saw the
hands in mine de charleus cup and so
it was that de charleus constant sugges-
tion backed up by mammys confirmation
preyed continuously on mme de charleus
mind

   this together with her husbands
threats and her fear of him was unques-
tionably sufficient to compass the tragedy
the three of them had expected and dread-
ed it was de charleu himself who con-
ceived his dreadful end then by syste-
matic reminder and accompanying threats
he pushed it toward fulfilment and finally
at the point of a knife drove his wife to
the desperate consummation of his own
suggestion

  dr richard sat down quietly without
question or objection from either side jus-
tification but-

   jedge you shore is gwine to be sorry
if you dont let me speak up mah baby
done tole de prezactly truf up to one pint
and dat am where she say mars amedee
snatch de hatchet out of her hand how
she know who snatch dat hatchet when she
got her arm over her eyes and aint never
look up she blurted this out before any-
body could stop her and randolph at
once put her on the stand again

   ah was soun asleep she said  when
mah baby come runnin ascreamin to mah
room him after her full tilt wid dat big
knife mah lamp was turned low as ah
hit de flo mah chile grab de hatchet and
struck out at de air and ah snatch de
hatchet away from her and let him have
hit just as he reach her ah tried to keep
her out of hit dats why i tole dat about
de shirt an dats all an hits de gawds

  randolph and nita looked at each other
for the first time

the

   mah baby done run to me foh pertec-
tion an ah pertected her mammy went
on  ah done sont dat debbil whah he
belong an de good lawd doan never pun-
ish nobody foh killin a pizen snake but
ah reckon a jedge aint spected to hab no
mussy even if ah is nuss him when he was

    but doan you believe hit jedge what
de fambly doctor say he is a smart man
but dey is things he dont know and one
of em is dat de de charleus cuss is more
dan any congestion it is a fac aint
mah folks always belong to de de char-
leus don dat make me a de charleu-
but not of de blood well den aint
de cuss come true an ah shore did see
tem hands in de cup an ah thought dey
was mis nitas ah mought hab knowed
better cause dey was-black hands

  for the space of a deep-drawn breath
there was dead silence

  when the judges gavel finally brought
order and both sides rested he cleared his
throat and turned to the jury

v

  a reluctantly sinking sun illumined
nitas lovely tear-wet face as randolph
helped us into the family carriage and
out of the deeps of a weeping willow a
mocking-bird sang his love-song in joyous
abandon

  mammy sitting beside uncle jesse
nodded condescendingly to those of her
color fortunate enough to get near her
henceforth she would be a personage she
had been acquitted of the terrible charge
of murder

   looking into randolphs eyes i saw the
dawn of a great hope and as we drove
away far down the sun-flecked shadow-
dappled street above the autumn clatter
of metallic palms and the laughter of folk
to whom past tragedy is present romance
there came to us a weird tuneless music-
the muffled negro holler that is like no other
sound in nature it is the forest song of
freedom from his savage ancestors

  and i echoed the suggestion that lay
therein for nita last countess of the house
of de charleu

the hotel oriental was unusually silent
-no not  unusually the word is
misleading because the thing hap-
pened every so often uneasily perhaps
describes the prevalent air of expectation
better

  lithe brown hindu boys dressed in
clinging white chupkuns slipped noiselessly
about their business on their bare feet
white guests dressed in the coolest ducks
or tussur silks lolled with their feet up on
long-arm cane-chairs in the far end of the
veranda and sipped pale yellow fizzy drinks
libelously described as scotch while they
talked in low tones and smiled with under-
standing tolerance

  the hotel manager a one-fifth portuguese
from goa who bore the proud name of
senhor dom roderigo cardozo pec-ped at
intervals from one of the many curtained
doorways and hoped for the best

  and all this because jehannum smith
had come back not from the war-he had
cpme back from that some little time ago
 invalided out though nobody could un-
derstand exactly why for smith was gener-
ally described as being the size of a door
and all his limbs were still where a lavish
nature had placed them there was some
talk of shell-shock but most people refused
to believe that that kind of shell could be
made

not that smith was abnormally huge

be wasnt more than a decent six feet or so
by some two and a half wide there was
something about his face rather which had
been carved by an unskilled workman out
of red granite with an ax which gave the
impression of immensity and strength and
domination that and his ideas which on
these occasions of his coming back were
colossally magnificent

  all the far east for instance remem-
bered with joy the time when he had con-
ceived the splendid notion that he was the
ameer of afghanistan and had gone forth
to purchase the y w c a as a suitable
nucleus to his establishment

  this coming-back habit of smiths needs
an explanation there would come periods
into the great mans life when his soul
seethed within him at the sameness of things
and the taste of the world was as sawdust
in his mouth then he would become rest-
less as an elephant about to go must and
his fellow men would note the symptoms
with uneasiness

   gorblimey smith would say presently
when the urge within him grew too puissant
for mortal soul  strike me pink but i
got to go on a exploration or somethin
and forthwith he would go

  his camp equipment consisted always of
the same impedimenta a half a dozen of
whisky and a package of crackers with
these and his native boy he would disap-
pear into the uncharted jungles after the
passage of days he would  come back -

 
 j eh annum  smith



having all the crackers and none of the
whisky

  where he had been or how he had lived
nobody ever knew sometimes tales would
drift in from frightened villages of a portent
in the land but even the district commis-
sioner could never get a word out of smith

  his demeanor on these occasions was a
vast and momentous solemnity marked by
an unblinkirfg stare from wide gray eyes
which were as devoid of all human expres-
sion as those of a long dead fish and his
speech consisted of the passionless consign-
ment of all who addressed him to jehannum
-which is the colorful oriental conception
of the lowest of the hells

  smith then had  come back and the
hotel oriental waited in anxious expec-
tancy not that smith was quarrelsome
far from it but his mind on these prodigal
home-comings was like the unaccountable
grease on the fly-wheel nobody knew at
what amazing tangent it might suddenly fly
off and it was always possible that smith
might have somewhere about him artillery
suitable to his size

  everybody remembered the joyous occa-
sion when an offensively overbejeweled
bengali princeling who had been educated
at eton-and was therefore of course quite
the equal of the best white men and better
than most-had spoken in a proprietary
way of some fluffy member of a pitiful
traveling musical comedy show from aus-
tralia the show of course was white
and the prince was-a raja

  now individual white men can never
learn to regard these loose-lipped vapor-
ings with equanimity governments some-
how seem to think differently and princes
whether of blue blood or brown weigh
heavily in the scales of those who sit in the
high places the group therefore seethed
but said nothing

  it was smith who had risen with massive
dignity and with the sightless stare of a
dead man had reached out a vast slow
hand and clutched the scion of royalty by a
bunch of his embroidered vest while he an-
nounced his passionless determination

    im goin to pull all the arms an legs
an things offn you an then let you go

  when an army had finally accumulated

and subdued the outraged white man before
anything could happen which the official
utterances could  deplore  as an  unfor-
tunate incident they had taken from
smiths person five revolvers of various
large calibers-all of them unloaded

  it will be readily understood then why
the hotel oriental watched and whispered
and waited

  smith sat now in the open veranda before
his room stiffly straight with his thick
forearms resting on the arms of his chair
quite flat like a sculptured egyptian god
contemplating the vastness of nothing with
the solemn impassiveness of the ages

  his boy slipped from behind the curtain
which was the only door to his room and
salaamed it was apparent to the men in
the far end of the veranda that he was
making lengthy orations but smith sat
like a stone god

  this native boy is worthy of mention
he was a madrasi from salapore whose
inherited cunning had shown him at an
early age that it was a discreet and profita-
ble maneuver to become a  curry-and-rice 
christian that is to say being without a
job and devoid of money he went to the
local mission professing a vague unrest of
the soul which was beyond his understand-
ing the good fathers joyfully embraced
him clothed him fed him taught him
english-a very fearful tongue- and in due
course baptized him exchanging his patro-
nymic oi poonoosawmi relic of paganism
for the christian name of paul

  after wlmeh paul gently faded from the
ken of the mission for he was now a mem-
ber in good standing of an extensive series
of clubhouses by the simple expedient of
going to a tin chapel of which there are
many in the land he could obtain at any
time food shelter clothing if necessary-
which was always having thus acquired
a veneer-a very thin veneer-of the true
religion and adapted it to suit his inherited
beliefs about godlings and devils poonoo-
sawmi paul had long ago lost the faculty
of distinguishing between right and wrong
with one ineradicable exception-that what-
ever his nter said and did and thought
was right	

  this exceptional boy then stood before

 his masters chair and delivered himself of
 a quantity of the english which he had
 learned at the mission

    marshter i telling true thing this
 one verree high class gentleman rupees he
 got like bug on damn nigger fellows coat
 from long distance-america-coming and
 tell only for see marshter

   smith stared motionless into space for
 three full minutes then at last his lips
 moved as an oracle might speak

    ow jehannum he said without pas-
 sion which is good arabic and comes from
 the same root as gehenna

   the boy salaamed gratefully and pleaded
 further

     but please marshter this feller making
 superior business talk plentee rupees you
 get

   thus adjured smith remained rapt in
 the contemplation of a hazy infinite the
 boy salaamed again and withdrew-but no
 further than behind the curtain of his
 masters room

   after a blankness of meditation which
 lasted an hour some germ of an impression
 seemed to have made its way into the giant
 mind smith rose suddenly and made his
 way with the accuracy of a sleep-walker
 along certain corridors instantly his boy
 was at his heels skilfully directing his steps
 and presently he darted to the front and
 drew aside a curtain

   within the room so unceremoniously in-
 vaded sat a gentleman whose first impres-
 sion was cigar whose second was fat gold
 chain and whose third was keen business
 the gentleman showed neither surprise nor
 annoyance at the invasion he was used to
 the queerest-looking people in- the world
 with the most staggering manners bursting
 into his presence unannounced in fact he
 was looking for such people for he was a
 vaudeville manager

   smith stood in the doorway and gazed
 at the man with wall-eyed gravity for three
 long minutes then he raised an unwaver-
 ing finger at him

    you go to ell he announced momen-
 tously and he executed an about-face with
 military precision	

  but the vaudeville man wasaccustomed
 to dealing with temperaments which were

very much more startling than smiths
artistic temperaments had been one of his
daily trials for many years and he had a
long experience in not letting a  find  get
away from him

  he made a bound for the door skilfully
twisted his callers maneuver into a com-
plete turn deftly piloted him into a chair
and with the grace of a conjurer produced
a selection of cigars smiths astonishment
at the swift efficiency of the gentleman from
the other side was such that he stayed
where he had been put the genial one
lit a cigar for himself then another for
smith and plunged into his business

  now then mr smith heres my propo-
sition im here looking for good head-line
stuff n ive heard a whole lot about this
classy dancer whos making such a splash
in some back-woods hindu temple around
here now back in the states weve had a
raft o phony princesses from the jersey
side whove got nothing except a good press
agent an im ready to gamble that the
genuine article properly handled will pull
a high number in the three figures a week
how bout it

   yuss said smith ponderously ho
yuss five undred rupees

  oh sure the manager agreed only
id make it dollars and thats goin some
for a one-girl dance specialty these days
now the way i dope it out these temple
janes are kinder prisoners so to speak
their makins goes to the management an
all they get is their keep so im figurin
that this queen will be tickled stiff to come
to a free country where her salary is her
own-of course im entitled to a fair com-
mission for my risk an-

  smith interrupted him solemnly weary
of all this unnecessary talk

   five undred rupees i calls fair

   oh i guess im entitled to more than
that mr smith all expenses press stuff
railroading an alkthat coming out o my
pocket but shell get a square deal from
me im no cheap john agent i wanna tell
you now see here if youll take up this
job ill pay you your own figure an ex-
penses on the side whatever graft any-
bodys got to get is covered by-

  once again smith interrupted the voluble
 jehannum  smith



agent the glassy eyes had closed in the
extremity of boredom and with the shut-
ting out of that codfish stare the hard-
chiseled face suddenly stood out in all its
rugged strength

   five undred rupees came the monoto-
nous murmur

   aw say now five hundred rupees
is pretty steep for just expense money but
see here ill make a deal with you all
these poor pikers around here say theyre
scared to tackle the proposition and they
tell me that you know these hindu ducks
like a book and if theres anybody wholl
take on the job youre the- say mister
are you-what th-well whadda ya know
about that

  the agents voice trailed away in dis-
gusted astonishment for smith had incon-
tinently gone to sleep nor would all the
agents shouting wake him and to lay
hands on that massive figure struck the
other as a gamble which was a little too
precarious even for his irrepressible spirit

  for half an hour smith remained like a
dead thing while the vaudeville man raved
of all the queer characters he had met none
had been as impossible as this

  then suddenly smiths eyes opened wide
without a blink without a suspicion of the
daze which marks one who has just slept
without a word he stood bolt upright on
his feet and walked solemnly from the room

  as he reached his own quarters poonoo-
sawmi appeared from the veranda side of
the curtain and busied himself about trivial
nothings while his master gazed vacantly
from the window presently the boy
coughed gently in preparation and his ques-
tion showed that he had been listening

  without shame he spoke for why should
there be any was not his masters business
also his

   marshter you going ketchum this
mutchni woman

  his masters answer made up for its
trifling inaccuracy by its staggering matter
of factness

   yuss me son five undred rupees we
gets for the job three times the blighter
tries to cut me down but five undred i
says resolute an ill go yer he says

  poonoosawmi knew better than to argue

this statement but he pleaded earnestly
against his masters resolve

   oah marshter please this bloody
awful madness temple female is holy
thing all the time this man making steal
away talk my liver is turning all into water
i am expert in all kinds of priests marshter
and i telling you this hindus is damn bad
fellows vengeance in his catechism is not
for the lords it is for the priest craftiness
and their forgetfulness is not

   poonoosawmi said smith  you shut
up an go to ell now its this ere malka
devi who does the hootch in this bloomin
old temple o mahadeo out on the goobari
road that the gent wants aint it

   yes marshter she is of most expensive
beautifulness but please marshter ma-
hadeo is verree powerful god if he is angry
he can turn all fellow into monkey

   all right me boy ill remember that
said smith  so now you run an tell the
bloke well bag the loot an deliver to-
morrow morning an hes to ave the paisha
ready five undred he said an not a
pais less

  the boy knew that argument was futile
he bemoaned his masters madness in
which he had been so cheerfully included
but he sped to the room of the zealous
vaudeville agent to him he paraphrased
his masters message

   sar my marshter telling you damn fool
for hell therefore to-morrow morning
time he is putting girl in the bag and deliver
loot for five-hundred rupees f o b this
much my marshter telling but i telling
you for safetyness you take this female in
the arm and run golly for hell in the ship
for priests is verree blood-curdling man
he is stabbing the belly cutting the throat
he is putting arsenic in the rice you one
time malakathwabi dead

  having delivered his message and his
warning poonoosawmi salaamed deeply
and turned to dart from the door

   hey wait a minute there the aston-
ished manager called  let me get this
straight you say your boss is going to
grab off this queen hows he propose to
pull the stunt

   that knowledge sar is for my myste-
rious wondering my marshter say
argosy and railroad mans magazine

ketchum all right can do what i know
how can my marshter is verree great
man

  with that the loyal youth ducked out
and hastened to be at his masters orders
for the preparation and planning of the
great coup mr smith reposed in a cane
chair with his feet on the extended arms
his orders were

   boy you hurry up an bring me a
whisky peg

  that was smiths last word for the rest
of that day his thoughts if he had any
were hidden behind the mask of the idio-
syncrasies attendant upon shell-shock the
vaudeville managers high hopes sank with
long leaps as each successive inquiry showed
that smith still sat in his chair with his
eyes- closed

   guess hes a four-flusher he muttered
in angry disgust  looks like its up to me
to round up some other attraction

ii

  yet when the quick tropical night had
fallen like a moist blanket over the land
two figures strode swiftly down the goobari
road i-rom time to time they shrank
aside into the dark teak jungle which fringed
the highway as parties of men obviously
late worshipers advertised their coming
from far ahead by the gleam of lanterns
which served the double purpose of dis-
closing scorpions in the path and frightening
away the devils in the tree-tops

  about a quarter of a mile from the temple
of mahadeo th more massive of the two
figures struck boldly into the jungle the
smaller followed but it was plain that
there was reluctance in his steps he kept
casting uneasy glances over his shoulder and
upward as they passed under low-hanging
boughs he crossed himself devoutly and
fingered a greasy scapular which he always
wore under his thin coat next to his skin

  he set great store by this scapular for
tightly sewn into its folds was a five-sided
cylinder of pure iron which had been guar-
anteed by a yogi of great merit to drive
away each of the five different kinds of
bhootlis which haunted the forest land

  presently the smaller of the two maraud-
ers spoke

   marshter how you grab this nautchm
from inside

   how should i know his master
grunted  when we gets there somethins
bound to turn up

  he plunged on through the darkness till
the jungle began to thin a little and pres-
ently a high wall loomed before them he
grunted again and surveyed it for a long
time in silence it looked almost as though
he slept standing the boy broke in on his
contemplation

   marshter to-day - afternoon - what
time you craftfully plotting i coming this
temple for worship the arranging whereof
is thusly outside is wall middle side is
outside court inside court holy place and
gods house surroundings is garden priests
house mango tope tank womens house
and what not

   well i knows it was his masters
amazing comment but poonoosawmi
youre a jewel says i therefore sit you
on the wall-top an wait whilst i goes on a
exploration

  he took the boy by the waist-band and
hoisted him to his shoulder without an
effort then with one hand under the soles
of his feet he heaved him up like a weight-
lifter the boy clawing wildly at the wall
the while till presently he lay like a limp
sack across its summit but he quickly
straddled the top and reached down a help-
ing hand smith however drew back a few
paces made a quick rush and a superb leap
and his finger-tips just hooked over the
coping

  it was all he needed in a second he was
sitting alongside of his servant and survey-
ing the great enclosed square which was to
be the scene of his coming depredation

  in the dim glow of the tropic starlight
the various buildings were easy to distin-
guish through the lacy fretwork of the
mango and orange trees far out to the
front near the road lights flared smokily
and every now and then a gong banged and
a conch-shell blared as some fanatical shadu
assailed the demons which lurked ever with
malicious intent about the holy places
back by the rear wall everything was dim
and silent

   that thing females quarter poonoo-
 jehannum  smith



sawmi indicated  but marshter please
sitting by my alone is a ghostly labor for
bhooth i got sacred amulet but in presence
of this mahadeo fellow i am verree fearful
man becoming riled monkeys he can
make

   ho ken he well me boy theres a
time when i has a argument with this ere
same mahadeo an i sloshes im in the
belly with a coconut an a million o priests
comes yawpin for to cut out me gizzard
an i metagrobolizes em by battalions but
i aint no monkey yet

  and with that the -amazing man leaped
like a vast ape to a perfectly impossible
branch and was lost in the heavy shadows of
its foliage what wild adventure of his
past lay behind that incident of the coconut
poonoosawmi never knew but he sat and
waited in contentment for his faith in his
master was infinite he saw him drop
springily from a lower limb and melt into
the darkness in the direction of the womens
quarters

  the staggering thing about the whole pro-
ceeding was the sublime carelessness of the
man on that exalted soul such trivialities
as preconceived plant or disguise had never
impinged their troublesome presence there
he stood a white man in a sacrosanct enclo-
sure restricted to a fanatical creed where
even governments did not venture to
interfere

  but paltry considerations such as these
never troubled that soaring spirit if the
thought came to him at all it was immedi-
ately counterbalanced by the supreme con-
viction that whatever untoward thing might
happen something equally unexpected and
astonishing would immediately happen to
offset it

  he ambled on therefore in the dark till
he came to the womens lines a long low
barrack removed quite a way from the
rest of the temple buildings just a series
of single rooms hardly more than cells
with a door in front and a grated window
in the back the doors opened out on a
long veranda with a floor of stamped earth
in which those unfortunate creatures who
had been dedicated to the temple service
cooked and ate and lived and did every-
thing in fact except sleep

  from most of the windows the wretched
light from open chirag lamps threw flicker-
ing shafts which lined the barrack with a
series of dim gun-ports

  with amazing directness smith strolled
along the rain-gutter and peeped into each
window till he was satisfied that he had
found the boudoir of the beauty whose fame
had reached all the four corners of the land
none too softly he called her name

  in an instant the woman was alert
intrigue is the life blood of the women of
the orient and for most of them penned
up as they are it is their only relaxation

  smith spoke a low bazaar hindustani
with the fluency of a coolie after twenty
minutes conversation with the girl her only
anxiety was the hazard of escape

   all that is necessary  nautchni is a
thick pole wherewith to pry off the bars of
thy prison said smith simply and there-
upon he shoved his hands comfortably into
his pockets and strolled off with the fixed
idea of finding a pole somewhere about the
grounds in the dark

  there was no slinking no crouching be
hind trees somewhere against the walls
smith knew there would be a lean-to or a
shed containing garden tools and he began
a leisurely exploration with the directness
of a man going about his legitimate business

  fortunately the far walls were of course
deserted quite fortunately again the di-
lapidated outline of a lean-to bulked pres-
ently ahead smith found himself treading
in a sand path and he strode forward with
eagerness

  then three figures drifted silently out of
the dimness in front of him

  they were dressed in a single robe of
dingy muslin which encircled the waist with
certain prescribed folds and draped the
loose-flowing end over the shoulders it
was their only garment even in the dark
they were instantly recognizable as priests
of mahadeo they stopped in surprise at
the crunching of boots on the sand

   kaun hai who is there one of them
called

   smith stared in their direction slowly
his head lowered like a bulls and he swelled
with indignation at their interruption
then


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   you-you go to ell he growled

  the priests came forward wondering at
this strange greeting and peered at the
queer figure which wandered in their gar-
dens for a few minutes the reality of the
horrible happening was unable to impress
itself on their brains the thing was too
inconceivable

  that a non-hindu should defile the in-
terior of a temple was unthinkable enough
but a christian and a white man so
frightful a sacrilege just could not happen
that was all yet it stood there and growled
at them

  their eyes began to open wide in fanatical
rage the first instinct of a native when
surprised in any way is to yell like a siren
horn the foremost of the priests opened
his mouth and then smithwith a sudden
spring clutched all three of them in a vast
anaconda embrace for crucial minutes the
four shapes merged into a single swaying
bulk in the darkness the priests struggling
to yell for help and smith straining all his
gigantic muscles to choke them to silence

  his great arms long as they were could
not surround all three of course but their
loose robes which offered such a satisfactory
grip helped wonderfully the best that the
panting three could accomplish was a chok-
ing squawk from time to time which smith
discouraged by a tighter squeeze

  but at last the great fellow got the hold
which he had been trying for he settled
himself and tightened his grip then like
a hammer-thrower he grunted with sudden
effort and put all the strength of his swelling
muscles into a whirling heave limbs flew
up in the air billowy robes spun in serpen-
tine curves and the whole straining mass
thudded together to the sand

  smith possessed a fist of the size and
consistency of a paving-stone w here it
fell there followed silence three times in
lightning-quick succession it dropped and
then smith sat up and scooped the sand
from the back of his neck

   gorblimey- hs panted  nerve o the
bloomin eathen but so elp me i only
socked em knockouts i aint killed a one
o the three-i dont think theyll come
around in about arf an hour an owl ruddy
murder

  with slow deliberation he felt for a head
in the dark and finding one dragged it
with easy confidence across his lap and
gagged it most efficiently with strips of its
own garment the other two he served the
same and grunted his satisfaction

  then as he contemplated his handiwork
a quaint conceit came to him he consid-
ered it gravely and with consideration its
allure grew with sober seriousness he
rolled the inert forms out of their robes
laid them carefully side by side like sar-
dines and then rolled them into a single
huge bundle which he folded over and
knotted and tied with elaborate care

   ill drop em down a bloomin well
somewheres he murmured so appro-
priate a disposition was eminently satisfac-
tory but smith was never one to spoil the
contemplation of a noble idea by haste
why should time or place be permitted to
interfere

  he grunted therefore arranged himself
comfortably against the bundle and drew
from his pocket a flask of unusual size

   cheer-o he said and he drank a health
to himself in celebration of his victory

  the bundle was softly comfortable
smith wriggled his great shoulders to dis-
pose of sundry protruding lumps to better
advantage and pondered with earnest im-
portance over the captives of his prowess
their uncalled for interference with his
plans irritated him and he grumbled petu-
lantly to himself

   sanguinary niggers ill-bloomin well
shove em in a-bloomin well swelp me
i will

  smiths virtuous indignation grew with
reflexion so ungentlemanly a meddling
with his vast plans was  unendurable and
his racing imagination launched itself into
a pleasant contemplation of yet vaster plans
for the utter immolation of the obtrusive
three his original quest and the appalling
risk of his present situation drifted back
into a dim insignificance before the absorb-
ing contemplation of various fantastic forms
of retribution

  it was only by the grace of the red gods
of shamgar whose peculiar province it is
to look after all true adventurers that the
whole thing had happened in the most de-
 jehannum  smith



serted part of the gardens smiths re-
minder of the stern necessities of life there-
fore was not through the searing agony
of a long knife-blade under the ribs but
he was constrained none the less to leap
suddenly into wide-eyed vigilance

  a stealthy scuffling in the branches above
had disturbed him he turned just in time
to see a dim shape hang for a moment in
black silhouette against the sky and then
drop full thirty feet from a great limb to
the ground and crouch facing him

  he was on his feet in an instant with
legs wide apart evenly balanced in alert
readiness for whatever might happen the
shape rose to its feet and advanced warily
toward him

  it was about a foot shorter than smith
but then again it was about a foot wider it
looked in the darkness like a horribly
formidable antagonist smith quietly low-
ered one of his knotty arms and drew it
back in preparation for an annihilating
drive without a sign of fear the shadowy
figure shuffled nearer

   krik-krik-krr-ee-eek it said in a high-
pitched voice

  it was smith who leaped back five feet
out of reach and landed on the balls of his
feet in his exact original defensive position
the burly shape advanced again swinging
a long arm just as smith did and chattering
inquiringly at him

  then smiths tense breath escaped from
him in a windy explosion and his great
bunched shoulder-muscles relaxed he
pointed a sudden finger at the huge bulk

   i know who you are he muttered
accusingly  youre a bloomin carnation

  the figure reached out with astonishing
length to take hold of the finger which
pointed at him and krikked again

   yuss youre a bloomin carnation o
hanuman thats what you are an youre
god of all the bloomin monkeys in the
world and you got a shrine somewheres in
ere

  the great ape chattered softly and snug-
gled nearer it was obviously quite tame
and entirely unafraid since quite apart
from its vast strength nobody would ever
have dared to molest it on account of its
extreme sanctity

  for hanuman had long ago been elevated
to the godhead in reward for his services
in helping the great god rama to get his
wife sita back from the hundred-eyed
demon ravana who had kidnaped her

   blimey aint e friendly muttered
smith and as he felt the creatures huge
arms  golly but im glad i aint ad to
fight im

  then reminiscently almost regretfully
 i aint never ad a fight with a god-only
with a coconut and after a ruminating
pause with inspiration  nor i aint neither
ever ad a drink with a god

  no sooner conceived than acted upon
smith produced his abnormal flask and took
a long draft

   eres to yer hanuman ji he wiped
the bottle politely to make up for his rude-
ness in drinking first and handed it to the
ape  ave a nip yerself old sport

  the great brute smelled at the bottle
and then tilted it awkwardly to its mouth
it coughed and spat as the fiery stuff burned
its throat but it smacked its lips over the
after aroma

   crickey e done it murmured smith
in awe  the beggars human ere dont
swig the ole blarsted lot ere gimme it 
he rescued the flask from the big brute
and stood in wondering cogitation of the
unusuai honor which had come to him in
drinking with one of the most revered of
the hindu pantheon then a sublime and
magnificent conception formed itself in his
brain he pointed a thick finger once more

   hanuman he uttered solemnly
youre a good sport an ill tell you
what im goin to make a offerin to you
yuss thats what im goin to do a bloom-
in offerin three priests i got what i cant
use-an im goin to give em to you
now you show me your little private shrine
ere an ill bring em right along an
maybe you got a pole or something that i
can use for a little job i got on hand

  the noble idea was worthy of smith in
his most exalted moments he stooped to
his great bundle of humans and up-ended
it like a great roll of bedding it wriggled
slightly but smith only grunted then he
turned his back to it reaching behind over
his head squatted for an instant and with
i

argosy and railroad mans magazine

a heave he hoisted the weight on to his wide
shoulder and staggered to his feet

   come on he grunted and he stepped
heavily out toward the central group of
buildings the ape shuffled and swung be-
side him

  in a hindu temple there are always a
number of niches and lesser shrines built
into and out from the jutting angles of the
outer wall smoky chirag lamps burned
before most of these but the danger of
light never entered smiths mind priests
could be seen further out toward the main
entrance but round to the rear nobody
paid any attention to the two dimly lit
figures smith passed one or two minor
shrines with scorn tnen a more preten-
tious one faced him before this was a little
court paved with red bricks and within
through the dimness loomed a grotesque
idol smith was satisfied

   ho i guess this is it he grunted
 anyow it  do and he dunlped his
bundle to the pavement and rolled it in
through the doorway he stood in the
entrance and stared emptily at the pot-
bellied deity

   funny lookin duck arms an iegs like
a blinkin centiped if i ad that a many
id-

  smiths cogitation was suddenly cut short
by a howl of astonished rage a group of
priests in silent bare feet had come round
the corner and stood looking at the desecra-
tion with fanatical horror

  smith had long ago absorbed the axiom
that the most efficient defense was-offense
with an instants glare to take in the situa-
tion he rushed at the crowd and essayed to
crush them all at once in a second he
was the center of a clawing shouting mael-
strom of whirling arms legs and robes

  the ape leaped up and down on all fours
and whooped with excitement smith with
wide-spread legs stood like a huge bear
which the hounds were trying to pull down
livery now and then a mighty buffet of his
got home and there was one less priest to
claw at him

  but more came running from around the
corner and immediately added their yells
and efforts to the original pack the crowd
in their clinging robes hampered one an-

other  but presently a knife flickered in the
smoky light and then another

   smith seized a lean priest of small stature
by the neck and thrust him choking this
way and that as a shield while he swung a
right arm like a derrick-beam wherever
it fell there fell also a priest the mob
surged against that defense like hillows

  then a man with a copper-bound lathi
or quarter staff of bamboo forced his way
to die center and swung at smith the
hard-beset giant lifted his shield to the blow
and crouched swiftly under it and the man
went down limp smith grabbed into the
crowd for another shield while the lathial
struck again this time the blow fell on
the shoulder of the leaping ape

  from such as saw it a gasp of horror
went up and from smith a shout of exhila-
ration for in an instant he had an ally
who was worth ten men

  with a coughing shriek of rage the great
ape leaped out at the crowd  tearing
hands and clutching feet and frightful
crushing jaws smith whooped with the
creature and smashed a knotty bunch of
knuckles at the chest of the man with the
staff the blow would have staved in a
barrel the mans knees crumpled and he
went down clutching at two of his fellows

  instantly smith snatched at the staff and
whirled it up with a shout he held it in
the middle in one immense hand and plied
both ends after the good old method of his
far back ancestors in a very few minutes
he stood alone in the center of a respected
circle and stepped on groaning bodies as he
fought forward

   a little distance off the frenzied ape at
whom none dared to strike back was a
clawing shrieking demon of venom and
fight a swift-leaping menace to which none
of the priests fanatic though they were
cared to turn their backs

  in this heaven-sent respite a gleam of
sanity came to smith as usual he acted
on it without a seconds consideration with
a final shout he rushed at two priests who
still faced him rather than the ape bowled
them over like ninepins and then shame-
lessly leaving the giant monkey to finish
the fight into which he had led it he turned
and dashed off into the darkness
 jehannum  smith



  the priests were so occupied with their
ferocious god that the few who noted
smiths flight had no stomach for following
that crazy hercules into the darkness under
the trees many minutes would have to
elapse before an armed pursuit with lanterns
could be organized but of minutes smith
needed only a few for the work he had in
hand

  having acquired the pole the lever which
he had set out to get his mind reverted
inflexibly to the job he had come to
accomplish

  it was hardly an effort for him to insert
the heavy bamboo under the grating of the
fair dancers prison and to apply one of his
massive shoulders to the other end the
whole grating tore its way out of the wall
bringing with it an avalanche of soft bricks
and cement

  in a few seconds the girl was dragged
through the jagged opening squeaking with
terror and pain smith bundled her in her
voluminous garments tucked her under one
arm and raced for the wall

  the faithful poonoosawmi sat where he
had been stationed counting off urgent
prayers to a long list of queer gods on his
rosary beads and quaking at the sounds of
strife which came from the direction of the
light glow he squealed joyously as the
crunch of running feet came over the leaves
and his masters form loomed in the shadow
beneath him

   ere ketch old an ang on panted
smith

  he spread his feet wide to get a good
purchase swung his bundle of cloth gently
once or twice to get the heft of it and then
heaved it upward with all the strength of
his great shoulders and loins

  poonoosawmi on the coping grabbed and
clutched at the billows of cloth and hung
on desperately as he was bid and in an-
other second smith himself sat astride the
wall and lifted the bundle easily to his lap
in a few more moments their footsteps
died away in the blessed sheltering darkness
of the jungle

  it was morning seven oclock and the
hotel oriental was thinking of getting up

for breakfast a closed match-box sort of
native carriage rattled up to the door a
white man and a brown man and a heavily
wrapped figure slipped out and hurried into
the hotel

  the vaudeville man was as usual quite
unmoved by the hurried entry of the three
smith stood with feet apart like a colossus
and pointed with a magnificent gesture to
the veiled loveliness

   theres your malka devi an my tip
to you is to grab er an then take a train
as fast as you knows ow-after andin over
five undred rupees

  the agent sprang up with an exclamation
 by golly you got her man youre
a genius but say hold on i got to see
her first aint i

  the girl needed no persuading to show
her beauty which had allured so many to
this man who was going to take her to a
land of affluence and freedom veils slipped
from her like the famous dance of the
seven and presently she stood forth in all
her glory-a middle-aged rather stout and
dusky lady of form and features which
while they suited the oriental conception
perfectly could never have measured up to
the standard of a ziegfeld chorus

  the managers face turned grayish and
he gasped

   gosh say mister did-are you sure
you got the right one

   sure suttinly arsk er yourself
 holy gee say id-id expected a
sort of a show-baby-broonette of course
but with a good make-up i figured shed-
gee whillikens but maybe shes got the
fancy steps tell her to do a turn

  smith translated nothing loath she
began to weave her arms in and out and
shuffled her feet and beat time with her
anklets

  the manager sat down heavily

   holy mike its the hootch a coupla
new shakes maybe but its the good old
coney island cootchie dance gosh-a-
mighty say is that all there is to a temple
dance

   no sir said smith  theres more to
it-heaps more-if you aint modest

  oh golly no yapped the manager
 say mister i cant handle this for a
argosy and railroad mans magazine

minute why if i sprung that stuff on an
american stage id be mobbed first and
pinched after no sirree this aint what
i figured on and i call the deal off you
take her away mister i cant do anything
jvith this act

  it was smiths turn to sit down heavily
 gawds he murmured  this ere is
a descent from the sublimey to the gor-
blimey

  poonoosawmi with keen business instinct
chimed in

   sar you dont wanting for pay five
hundred rupees

  five hundred rupees the manager
almost shrieked  say i couldnt stage
that for fifteen a week no sirree the
deal is off i tell you why i just hired a
troupe of performing goats thats a better
drawing-card no sir you take hor right
away before her owners arrive and com-
mence to carve up the landscape

  so cold-bloodedly irresponsible a repudia-
tion was quite a shock but then that is
the way of vaudeville managers

  smith was never a man to haggle he
rose majestically andstrode from the room
poonoosawmi followed with the wondering
woman the shock however after all the
frightful risks he had taken was sufficient
to call for a bracer smith was never a
man who hesitated over bracers he took
one-in proportion commensurate to the
shock the measure of the bracer showed
how powerful the shock had really been

  then smith sat back in his long-armed
cane chair to consider the problem after
staring into the void for some minutes he
propounded the question to his servant

   poonoosawmi whatre you goin to do
with the girl now youve got her

  poonoosawmi was quite unmoved by this
sudden responsibility thrust upon him

   i dont knowing marshter i think
maybe putting in ticca gharry and telling
drive like hell for temple

    poonoosawmi youre a fool said his
master nodding wisely and pointing the
accusing finger  she wont go she was
too bally pleased to get out

   then i am at losses said the servant
-and speeding is needful for this priest
fellows soon coming and making bobbery

   all right quoth smith with awesome
seriousness  you tell em to go to ell-
an you go too came a long pause with
closed eyes then  an take er with you
the last was a dreamy murmur and in the
next instant smith slept with the untroubled
peacefulness of a child

iv

  he woke with his usual wide-eyed alert-
ness two hours had passed but there had
been no cataclysm of battle and murder
and sudden death the boy stood exactly
where he had been the only difference
was that the girl had gone and a coar
gunny sack lay on the table

  smiths eyes always took in everything
in a flash-habit born of necessity

   whats that there he demanded
  poonoosawmi grinned all over

   this marshter is rupees

   what as the geezer changed is blink-
in mind

   no marshter i taking woman like you
tell

  smiths vague recollection of his last or-
ders was sufficient cause for mystification
 where to-to ell

   oah no marshter how can  take
to one armenian fellow in bazaar one
verree low fellow marshter he agent for
matrimonial of nawab of dacca-that one
mohammedan swine two-three dozen he
got five hundred rupees price i sell and
agent is paying with leaps temple trained
female of muscular contortions is verree
valuable marshter 

  for the first time in his life smith was
overcome with astonishment he sat back
eyes closing and opening in spasmodic
jerks

   strike-me-pink  he muttered an
whatd she say

  poonoosawmis grin went all the way
round to the back of his head

she plentee tickling marshter she
give me one ring for bakshish look see
and he lifted a dusty homy foot and
displayed a half-carat ruby shining from
the grime of his middle toe

   gorblimey  murmured smith and
consciousness drifted softly from him and
he slept the sleep of the just

what has already happened

apparently the sole survivor of the ill-fated irene statler dr vawter told an amazing story
to his fellow travelers in a pullman smoking compartment including among others a coarse
seaman and arthur westcoft whose fiancie dorothy gaylord had been the only girl aboard
the vessel following the murder of captain jessup vawter stated and the finding of two huge
green spiders under his berth suspicion passed from letcher a naturalist to ulmquist the carpen-
ter and then to the reserved and quiet falkens mankus the mate a hairy brute who had
suddenly begun to drink heavily following jessups death was now in charge and the rivalry for
the girls favor between him and letcher became acute now that the captain was out of the running
as a result of an impromptu investigation ulmquist was put in irons mankus killed a mutinous
sailor and the very air seemed filled with menace

    for suddenly one evening when they were sitting in the saloon the lights went out something
or some one rushed from the captains stateroom and a terrific struggle ensued in the darkness in
which the chief engineer was killed the crew had mutinied stolen and consumed a quantity of
wood alcohol and with mankus a prisoner began a wild debauch during which vawter fearing
for dorothy and going aft for the captains pistol was knocked out by the blow of some unseen
assailant when he came to he found the ship driving upon a rocky coast and with the crash
again lost consciousness and recovering found the ship strangely silent and deserted

    when vawters strength was somewhat restored he made shift to reach shore by means of a
smalf boat which was wrecked in the passage then from a clifl-edge through his glasses he saw
several figures on deck one of whom lie made out as mankus reaching the ship by means of a
ladder of vines and a short swim from the cliffs foot he was just in time to see mankus advancing
on dorothy with outstretched arms mankus caught dorothy about the waist with both hairy
arms and forced her brutally to him just as vawter reached the rail

prisoners of the tide

 t ands off i exclaimed raising my
i i club threateningly as i sprang to-
ward him

  at this unlooked-for interruption dor-
othy started glanced at me and turned pale
mankus released her with one arm and
swung round with a look half startled half
angry evidently prepared to defend his
rights against all comers in the flesh but
as his fish eyes took in the situation his
arms dropped to his sides his great jaw
sagged he recoiled and his face paled

   wha-wha- he gasped but his legs
wabbled beneath him and his lips worked
convulsively

this story begat in t

	argosy	

   if you touch this girl again ill kill
you i repeated advancing toward him

   wha-wha-who he whimpered and
clutched the rail unsteadily  mother o
god whered ye come from he finally
gasped

   from the ocean ill always be near
at hand to protect miss gaylord against
you understand that

  mankus had now come to the sage con-
clusion that i was not a ghost but he
showed no fight

   the sawbones muttered huskily wip-
ing his parched lips with the back of a
hand  that you doc-are you alive

   very much so i returned satirically
 well thats different again but ye
aint a fooling me are ye doc he de-
argosy for march 


argosy and railroad mans magazine

manded suspiciously  no well thats
different too alive-and hearty thats
the answer to that question that theres
the answer to that question

  why he considered it necessary to as-
sure us repeatedly of this obvious fact he
did not enlighten us but continued

   well thats different again alive
thought ye was dead doc now on my
soul i thought ye was-but glad to see ye
sure glad to see ye back agin even if ye
did interrupt a little queenin match id
been a laying plans fer fer some time next
time dont butt in so bruptly send in yer
card-

  you heard what i said i exclaimed
angrily now leave us

  mankus drew himself up at this and
squared his shoulders but the sight of the
club in my hand pacified him

   well doc he drawled  i guess i aint
got no quarrel with ye an you aint got
no quarrel with me-as i figger i got
rights to this little gal as much as you
more the way shes been a stringin an a
playin me-

  i strode toward him and he retreated a
step

   all right doc steady there the voice
with the smile wins im a goin to leave
ye but ill tell ye somethin ye aint
seen the soft looks this gal give me all
along its the way with the sex to pur-
tend one thing-but shes mine and i say
hands off if ye knowed what  know-but
doc i thought ye was dead an now yere
alive-thats the answer to that question
i guess ill go forard an see how the grubs
a cornin along but i aint through yet-
mind that

  with that he swept off his cap to each of
us in turn and swaggered forward to the
alleyway

  till now dorothy had spoken no word
i saw that her pallor still remained but
whether because startled at my sudden rise
from the grave or because of the ordeal
through which she had just passed i could
not at once determine her sweet eyes
glowed with wonder and thankfulness as i
crushed her little hands in mine

  i briefly outlined my adventures as we
walked slowly forward and she told me that

falkens and george letcher had gone off
in the boat early in the afternoon they
should have returned long before now her
father mankus and herself were alone on
the ship

  as soon as i changed my clothes dorothy
announced we would wait dinner no longer
the three of us sat at the table and i
learned from dorothys lips what had be-
fallen them

  it will be remembered that i left falkens
and letcher crouching in the alleyway op-
posite the saloon just at the critical mo-
ment when some of the crew were getting
ready to batter in the door of dorothys
stateroom it was my intention to get the
dead skippers gun from the aft-hatch in
time to reenforce falkens and letcher in
their plan of attempting a rescue

  poggio now half drunk was the leader
of those who wished to break down the
door but the brute ulmquist soberer and
planning to save the girl for himself ob-
jected the men fell to parleying while
others began shooting craps and brawling

  poggios hot southern blood did not long
brook ulmquists dictatorship and when
the latter rose from his chair at the head
of the table and left the saloon poggio
seized this opportunity to put his designs
into execution

  one of his retainers a malay of crossed
blood swaggered toward dorothys door
with the intention of forcing it but he had
taken only three steps when his swarthy
face convulsed spasmodically after writh-
ing a few moments apparently in great
agony he fell to the floor

  most of his companions thought he was
ridiculously going through some marriage
rite according to the custom of his particu-
lar jungle and they roared heartily at his
ludicrous pantomime but in the midst of
their merriment one of the white stokers
who had gone below came shrieking dash-
ing lunging into the saloon tearing out
his hair by the roots and striking his belly
his wild course and staring eyes showed
that he was stone blind stumbling against
ulmquists empty chair he fell to the rug
writhing and frothing at the mouth

  a third man a portuguese with a strain
green spiders



of malay blood dashed shrieking across
the tween-decks and with an insane cry
jumped overboard two more of poggios
men in the saloon were stricken with nau-
sea at these additional sounds of commo-
tion the negro tack came bounding up
on deck shouting

   the hant the hant a hoodoo
ship

  a series of wild shrieks below and aft
showed that the  hoodoo  was working
elsewhere some of the men were over-
taken with convulsions and died in the
focsle others died in the saloon on the
tween-decks or jumped overboard pan-
demonium seemed to have broken loose
one of the mortally stricken machinists
yelled desperately despairingly for the
doctor

   its pison i say fetch the saw-
bones fer the love of god

   he cant help you bawled some one

 hes croaked an overboard-an god
too

  a hoodoo ship a hoodoo ship
shouted tack rolling his eyes terribly and
others took up the cry meanwhile falkens
took the opportunity to slip down to the
brig and release mate mankus who con-
cealed himself in jessups cabin and locked
the door

  by morning the extent of the havoc was
ascertained it was even more devastating
than had been feared the only survivors
among the crew were ulmquist poggio
omura tack and two other negroes one 
engineer stone blind and five portuguese-
malays the two negroes and the majority
of the malays were sleeping off the effect of
their potations there were only two men
in the engine-room and ulmquist himself
had to take his trick at the wheel

  in the night letcher had succeeded in
getting a knife from a dead stoker but
falkens failed to get one of the guns for
the crafty ulmquist took them all as soon
as their owners were stricken and poggio
partly sobered by the disaster threw the
extra knives overboard

  a new situation had to be faced at once
the ship was terribly short-handed and her
engines were left to the mercy of unskilled
men ulmquist the most capable sailor of

the lot was frankly unfitted to cope with
the situation and in addition now lived in
mortal terror of the hoodoo frenzied and
panic-stricken he crowded all the steam on
the ship he could make held a course south-
west and gave orders to run for the first
land that should be sighted

 ever since the storm the irene had been
leaking a little but practically no work had
been done at the pumps since jessups
death and the ship settled lower and lower
ulmquist piped all hands to the pumps
but at the end of two hours work the depth
of water in the well showed an actual in-
crease

  it was too late to save the ship the out-
look seemed desperate night came on
again and the crew lacked the courage to
face it the cry of  land ahead  did not
mend matters for it soon became only too
evident that the irene was running full tilt
before a strong wind toward a line of un-
broken cliffs which were unrelieved by
lights either stationary or revolving

  no effort was made by ulmquist to
change his course or reverse engines it
was as if lje and his crew had gazed with
horror at the fata morgana that dread re-
incarnation of many forms which beckons
sailors to their destruction

  there came a sudden lull in the wind
the long heave and thrust of the swell had
subsided to comparative calm and the ship
deprived for the moment of the impulse of
the wind lost way for a space coming al-
most to a full stop as if in the grip of some
powerful current making from the shore
her engines laboring against the sluggish-
ness of the ship herself seemed all at once
to slacken speed it was now or never a
veritablefrenzv now possessed them the
best life-boat was lowered with mad haste
and every man jack of them including
omura and his dictionary tumbled into it
and rowed desperately away

  mankus now came out of his hiding-
place took in the situation and with the
help of falkens and george letcher low-
ered a second boat the irene was so low
in the water the roar of the breakers so
loud and terrifying and the tall black cliffs
were so near that mankus grew alarmed
and would not take the time to stock the


argosy and railroad mans magazine

boat with adequate provisions daniel
gaylord was helped into the boat followed
by his daughter and the five of them were
soon clear of the ship and rowing away
from the cliffs

  with the departure of all hands the wind
again rose the ship like a thing alive with
wheel lashed lights blazing fore and aft
and engines going full tilt once more
steamed straight toward the cliff but in-
stead of being dashed to pieces and sinking
before their eyes she was suddenly swal-
lowed up hull deck-house stacks and
lights quite as if she never had been she
seemed a fantom ship indeed

  all exclaimed with horror at this inex-
plicable phenomenon the three rowers re-
doubled their efforts to combat both wind
and current and upon gaining some half
mile of distance from the cliffs they di-
rected their course westward at length
they succeeded in making a landing on the
lee shore of a small promontory and here
they passed the night

  in the morning the sea was still running
they did not dare venture out in the boat
falkens and mankus devoted the day in an
effort to reach the top of the cliffs but
failed they learned however that ulm-
quists gang had landed about a mile further
west on a palm-lined beach for the next
two days the high wind obtained the
scanty provisions and the single keg of
water began to run short there were no
fruit trees except betel-palms near this bar-
ren part of the coast

  the sailors too were having their trou-
bles for about noon ulmquist and the larg-
est of the negroes came over to borrow a
box of matches falkens gave him some
matches and asked for a sack of potatoes
ulmquist laughed his hoarse laugh and said
he would take the question under advise-
ment then he said he would give them the
potatoes if  the little leddy maam  would
return with him to his camp and select the
ones she wished

  of course this offer was promptly de-
clined and ulmquist remarking that he
would see her again when she  warht too
high-toned and too high-brow  to talk to
him took his colored retainer and returned
to his men

  the few crabs and shell-fish on the beach
were not enough to sustain life all were
agreed it would be most unwise to have
further dealings with ulmquist and his
precious crew and the following morning
the sea being rather calmer they embarked
before daylight and rowed back along the
cliff to find a more fertile country

  upon rounding a projecting lip of rock
they were hugely surprised to find a deep
inlet this they entered forthwith with
the result that by  am they were all
safely back aboard the irene from the
signs in saloon and galley it was evident
that the ship had been visited in their ab-
sence and they concluded that some of ulm-
quists gang must have come for food and
water

  daniel gaylord was delighted to reach
the ship again rapidly recovering his
health he vowed he now had enough ma-
terial to write seven novels the first of
which he meant to begin work on at once

  falkens however was restless upon
him seemed to devolve the responsibility
and he realized the necessity of reaching
the high ground of the island to determine
if it were inhabited learn its resources and
take steps looking toward an escape

  accordingly shortly after lunch he and
george letcher took the boat and rowed
away they were now three hours over-
due and every one was feeling anxious

  such then was the brief narrative of
what had befallen ship passengers and
crew from the moment i was struck on the
head and knocked into the hatch till the
present time

   well sawbones said mankus who
had now joined us at dinner and was busily
picking his teeth with a sharpened match
 that theres the answer to that question
an all along we thought ye was croaked
an overboard but instead ye was a layin
in the cabbitch crate down in the aft-hatch
whicht was different agin whod a thunk
it why i never heerd  sitcha think
doc

  having now reduced the end of the match
to pulp he spit it out and inserted in his
mouth five sticks of chewing-gum one after
the other before he continued
green spiders



   no sirree i guess i never heerd o
siich a think an who do ye guess rapped
ye on the dome doc ye must a see his
face or arm or suthin

   no said i  it was too dark

    it couldnt a been the hoodoo now eh
he suggested digging the head of a match
into his ear and twisting it with a look of
ineffable relief  i alwuz like to know the
answer to that question nit the hoodoo
would a made a clean job of it like it
foxed the skipper besides i aint taking
stock in that there hoodoo thats focsle
talk thats an excuse of them ignorant
swabs of loafers when they gets tired of a
ship then who was it rapped ye on the
dome doc why i tell ye that skunk
ulquist it was him done it an croaked
the skipper too

  daniel gaylord who had been growing
very restless took this opportunity to leave
us mankus was now absent-mindedly
picking his teeth with the match that he had
put in his ear and dorothy turned away
and started to go on deck

   are ye worrited miss dorthy over the
absent heroes called mankus  aw
shucks no need to git so all-fired anxious
over the likes o them is it falkens or
eorge bug-ketcher yer purtendin yeve
tooken a fancy to now

  dorothy had already left the saloon and
did not hear this last remark

   wouldnt it beat ye doc wouldnt it
beat ye exclaimed mankus turning to
me  the way a female plays off one man
agin another it does em good to git
worrited an weep over them thats absent
while spittin on them thats under their
nose thats the female of it

   now if i was absent instead o them
shed be a straining her two eyes down
channel jist the same her little heart a
going like a donkey injine and a bouncin
in her boosum at every ripple o brine
shed crowd on full steam ahead and run
after me but if she was to sight my stacks
or masthead light shed back water an ware
off a showin as cool a pair o heels as ye
please doc females is like boats they
dont savvy where theyre a goin nor why
unless theres a man at the wheel

  we now heard the welcome splash of

brine astern the rhythmic gurgle of water
and the hiss of foam as if the life-boat were
returning but though we listened we could
not detect the creak of oar-locks the drip
of blades on being lifted from the water
nor the rippling sound of a prow cutting a
rapid path up the channel

   thats funny observed mankus as we
strolled out and joined dorothy on the
after-deck  that dont sound like no
ships boat he pulled at his lip nervous-
ly  but i guess it must be them all
right

  we strained our eyes into the darkness
but could see nothing

   perhaps its the echo we hear i sug-
gested

   sure thats the answer to that ques-
tion returned mankus gruffly but there
was an uneasy note in his voice one huge
hand stole toward the revolver that falkens
had given him earlier in the day  them
blasted slithering ghost-raising echoes
stab my guts if i ever heerd-but falkens
hell turn up again all right i knowed all
along that hed turn up hes so all-fired
quiet ye wouldnt never think he could
take keer of himself but hes got arms like
iron

  from the way that mankus gingerly
rubbed one of his own elbows i deduced he
must already have felt the force of that iron
grip and i believed i knew the reason why
just at present  the reason  was leaning
gracefully over the rail by my side serenely
unconscious of everything except the gentle
plash of the brine astern and the rhythmic
strokes that caused it

  for more than a quarter of an hour we
strained our eyes into the night each suc-
ceeding moment but added to our per-
plexity then mankus cried

   looky there my soul that aint no
boat

  a small dark object near the base of the
walls to our left had emerged from the
black of the night - a man swimming
with powerful overhand strokes he drew
quickly nearer he seemed naked from
the waist up and wore no shoes when
still some two hundred feet from ihe stern
of the ship he paused to get his breath

   swimmer ahoy  bawled mankus


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   ahoy the irene came falkenss deep
voice

   whats the lay cried mankus  say
ye aint capsized an lost our precious boat
have ye

  falkens answered but he had now re-
sumed swimming and the splash of water
muffled his words we waited till he
grasped the cable and began to climb drip-
ping and exhausted to our side

  i now withdrew into the background to
await a more favorable opportunity but
even at this exciting moment when i should
have been interested solely in hearing the
story that falkens had to tell i found my-
self watching dorothys face jealously hop-
ing and yet fearing that she would betray
by some unguarded look or impulsive ges-
ture her real attitude toward falkens

  in fine there was no longer any dis-
guising the fact from myself  i was jealous
of falkens again i vowed that come what
might he should not have her scarcely an
hour ago  had contemplated his return with
comparative calmness i had even shared
dorothys uneasiness at the long delay and
had told myself again that if she loved him
i would surrender her with good grace
but in this last half-hour i had had her to
myself-for mankus no longer counted her
nearness and trustfulness had intoxicated
me i had been her protector and com-
panion without a rival

  the consciousness that for the time be-
ing i was  cock of the walk  and the only
man on board except her father to whom
she could turn had put the fight into me
henceforth i was in the battle to win and
in it to the death

  yet here was a man come up out of the
sea to take her from me as i had taken her
from mankus here was falkens dripping
with brine staggering with exhaustion pale
and in such a pitiable plight that a woman
who loved him must surely disclose her
feelings with her first words

  as falkens clutched the lower rung of
the rail and dragged himself to the deck
dorothy took a step toward him and her
lips moved  mr falkens-you she ex-
claimed as she recognized him her voice
faltering with such evident emotion that i
clenched my fists  where-wheres mr

letcher she gasped clasping her hands
tightly together and holding them toward
him supplicatingly  oh what has become
of him

   safe said falkens laconically pressing
the water from his hair chest and arms
 ulmquist took our boat when we were
both ashore we started to swim back but
letcher gave out i got him ashore

  not by look tone or movement did he
betray disappointment at dorothys eager
interest in letcher he seemed absolutely
proof to her charms as he continued with
quiet assurance

   hes now comfortably hidden in the
rocks miss gaylord we must get him in
the morning

   we must get him now said dorothy
firmly

   no miss gaylord hes all right
made me promise to rest till daylight what
we must do is to devise some plan for
bringing him off

   how kin wegit him without a boat
demanded mankus grinning as if hugely
enjoying letchers predicament

   its got to be done somehow a raft-
 and git a raft out agin that current
nix that theres the answer to that ques-
tion i guess letcher  have to rustle fer
himself thats thepenalty fer the fool
stunt of losin the only boat we got i
guess you said it was him that done it eh
falkens drew himself up and eyed man-
kus steadily  i said nothing of the kind
mr mankus for the loss of that boat i
take the whole responsibility its gone and
thats the end of it

   well it was a dern fool stunt anyway
persisted mankus  i heerd you say this
mornin you was takin letcher along only
to watch the boat an now think of him a
hidin out there in the rocks all wet think
of him doc he cried explosively slapping
his sides and turning to me  jest think
of him doc 

  at this rather brutal remark i advanced
toward them and when falkens realized
the situation he seemed so genuinely glad
to find me alive that i felt heartily ashamed
of myself

  he went to his cabin for a change of
clothes and then joined us in the saloon to
greex spiders



discuss ways and means of reaching letch-
er when he had eaten dinner he felt so
much better he was for swimming back with
a load of provisions and attempting to bring
letcher in by easy stages but from this
plan dorothy anfl i dissuaded him

   if we only had some bamboo said
falkens  the problem would quickly be
solved

   how so i asked

    outriggers

   owriggers-whats them asked man-
kus with his most incredulous grin

    outrigging canoes like those the malays
use to shoot rapids and in interisland
trade explained falkens patiently  by
working all night i believe the three of us
might be able to knock together a narrow
tub of a boat from loose lumber-

    cant be did-thats the answer to that
question grunted mankus polishing his
mouth with the back of his hand to remove
the remains of a large boiled potato with
which he had just supplemented his own
dinner  how about calkin seams how
about oars an locks how about ridin
the breakers without turnin tuttle any
boat we could mak would keep us workin
double shifts fer a month an then ye
wouldnt git very far them breakers is
the worst  ever see the fact of the mat-
ter is ladies and gents were prisoners
aboard the old irene an here were a goin
to stick a while thats the answer to that
question

   dorothy evidently took him at his word
for presently she rose and left the saloon
without offering any comment

   personally i was inclined to be a trifle
skeptical i looked for the ulterior motive
and found it i felt convinced mankus had
multiplied objections to the plan because he
was not only willing but eager to leave
letcher to his fate since captain jessups
death mankus had felt that letcher was his
only rival worth fearing and dorothys re-
cently -expressed solicitude over letchers
fate had confirmed him in this belief and
increased his dislike when i glanced at
falkens i saw that he too had read man-
kuss motives

   who is this letcher id like to know
mankus continued venomously  a lemon-

rind dung-heel hes got a mug on him
like a bulldog an ugly bulldog an when
he aint groomin his manners to make an
impression he aint no different to one too
how he kin fool anybody is more- with
his swelled head always braggin an mow-
in an a first-class nut at that but be-
hind all that theres something uglier to
take into account yes sirree-

  dorothy had returned and had heard
the last part of this tirade against letcher

   mr letcher hasnt done anything to
forfeit our assistance said falkens  hes
a wonderfully well-read man and has had
some amazing experiences of his own but
this isnt figuring how to rescue him

  i could not but observe how quietly and
magnanimously falkens had championed
the man who was not present to defend
himself the contrast between mankus
and falkens-the one with his slanderous
sledge-hammer blows the other with his
praise where praise was due marked the
depth of the gulf which must ever inter-
vene between the classes from which these
two men were drawn as for the traits in
letchers make-up which deserved condem-
nation falkens had ignored them

   i too feel that mr letcher is a won-
derful man murmured dorothy  won-
derful in a good many ways and deserving
of any sacrifice we can now make to help
him

   is he though growled mankus
 thats jist thepint im a makin-not to
be disputin ye miss dorthy an all that
sort of think but is it up to us to save a
murderer

  a murderer  exclaimed

   now yeve said sortiethink letcher
hes been too deep fer us hes been a
foolin of us all along with his talk of
drown led spiders an his innocence oh
hes played his keerds careful an crafty
right from the start of the hull think its
only while i was a monkeyin round the
tween-decks and superstructure to-day
sort o thinkin thinks over an calculatin-
its only while  was a setlin here at the
table here to-night before dinner in the dark
a lookin toward the skippers cabin so
silent an solemn an puttin two an two
together that i tumbled 


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  dorothy had turned a trifle pale she
leaned slightly toward mankus her lips
parted her eyes containing a look of dread
not pleasant to see

   what did you learn mr mankus
demanded falkens suddenly

    im almost ascairt to tell ye he said
solemnly impressively  if it was to come
to a show-down whether id lift a hand to
save letcher id vote no hes out there
on the rocks a starvin to death is that
righteous yea says i its a judgment
on him its the finger o gawd my sould
go to hell if i was to lift a finger to save
him or let any one lift a hand to save him
while im boss of this here ship letchers
got to die for it was him that croaked the
skipper jest like i said at the start-thats
the answer to that question-an i got the
papers to prove it

chapter viii

dorothys confession

i had never seen falkens so deeply afiect-
ed as he was by mankuss accusation of
letcher the sudden fire in his eyes and
the animation of his face showed that he
meditated an immediate reply but evi-
dently he thought better of it for he hesi-
tated toyed a moment with a teaspoon
then pushed his plate slowly from him
dorothy had risen from her chair face
white and set hands clenched at her sides
lips slightly parted with an expression
which showed she was nerving herself to
some resolution just as she was about to
speak falkens who had now mastered
himself cleared his throat and exclaimed
abruptly

    that makes no difference mr mankus
theres something much bigger in the lives
of us all than the murder of captain jessup
theres no sense quibbling about it no use
blinking the facts were in a desperate
plight here-prisoners as you say aboard
this helpless hulk provisions gradually
dwindling it seems to me weve got a
man-sized problem to wrestle with the
more heads and hands we have to work on
it the better

  mankus idly poked a thumb-nail into

the empty loops of his cartridge belt ana
picked at the metal stud of the revolver
holster belt and gun with its three car-
tridges really belonged to falkens but
mankus made no effort to return it and i
somehow gained an impression from his
proprietary manner that he did not mean
to do so no doubt he considered that in
his capacity of captain of the irene he had
justly requisitioned the gun for any emer-
gency that might arise

  humph he grunted letcher 
only eat his head off at the grub an its
precious little help wed git from him all
he kin think of is bugs an spiders an wim-
min first thing hed do if he was to git
back aboard hed croak me or you or the
doc jist like he croaked the skipper i wont
help sitch a scoundrel nor i wont leave
him come aboard i guess ye got better
sense than to try it

   falkens turned on him like a flash

   do you think  fear you mr man-
kus he demanded and for a moment his
eyes blazed with fire which betrayed his
estimate of the mates conduct and charac-
ter but again he controlled himself
 no  he exclaimed shaking his head  i
beg your pardon no use bringing it to an
issue on those grounds when i can meet
you on your own

    i thought not rejoined mankus grin-
ning at what he considered an easy victory
 i knowed ye was level headed enough to
square with my views if i give ye time
lf youve just accused mr letcher of
murdering captain jessup continued fal-
kens evenly we ignored your words
but now they cease to be a jest i advise
you to weigh them very carefully before
you repeat that accusation

    ill repeat it agin ill repeat it to you
or any one it was letcher that croaked
the skipper

   then-prove it

   hey

    prove it

   prove it of course i kin prove it
jedge fer yourself there lays the skippers
cabin right starbd side forard and there
aint nine paces between it an letchers
door on tother side-nex to miss dorthys
fathers stateroom when letcher come
greex spiders



out of his room that night jist before eight
bells with the spider-box in his hand-

   how do you know letcher came out of
his room just before eight bells that night
asked falkens

   how do i know how do i knowi
aint i to believe my own eyes

   you saw him then

   -	 sure

   where were you

   i was a goin to the engine-room down
the starbd alleyway jist as i turned into
the shaft i see some one cornin from near
letchers room to go out on the tween-
decks

   did you see his face

   how kin you see a face through the
back of the dome he was stoopin over
thats why he didnt look as tall as letcher
an was a wearin a long kimony or dressin-
gown carried somethin in his hand what
could be plainer n that letcher a bug-
catcher with a room full o spiders poison
-bite-spiders-an the skipper croaked
letcher-thats the answer to that ques-
tion

   is that your only reason for thinking
mr letcher caused jessups death
mankus who had settled back in his
chair with a self-satisfied look now leaned
forward again and planked his huge hands
upon the table

   thats as ye might think but i aint
a tellin all i know aint this reason
enough

  no rejoined falkens emphatically
 you didnt see the mans face you didnt
see exactly which room he left you cant
even swear the object in his hands was a
spider-case do you still persist in accus-
ing mr letcher

   strikes me mr falkens all this here
polly-vooz is foolish it aint a goin to
change me an leave him git aboard hes
out there on the rocks a starvin to death-
an thets a jedgment on him fer croakin
the skipper

   very well mr mankus said falkens
rising swiftly and taking a step toward him

 then i accuse you-here before two com-
petent witnesses-of foully murdering cap-
tain jessup

  mankus cringed as if he had received a

physical blow gulped and moistened his
parching lips with his tongue

   wha-what he stuttered blinking
his red-lidded eyes very rapidly for a few
moments and flushing apoplecticallv

   the piece of string which was tied to
the lid of the spider-box came from a ball of
twine in your cabin you by your own
confession were in the vicinity of jessups
cabin at the time the crime must have been
committed xo one aboard had more rea-
son to hate and fear captain jessup than
yourself he had threatened to complain
to the ow-ners of your carelessness and
ignorance and obtain your discharge your
conduct the day follow-ing the murder was
decidedly suspicious every one of us can
testify to these things the question of
your guilt is not only a possibility in our
minds-it is a decided probability

   in the course of this terrible arraignment
mankus continued to gulp and change
color and once he clawed at his throat as
if struggling for breath but now by what
seemed for him an unusual effort he partly
mastered his terror and at the conclusion
broke into a hoarse laugh

  he he he tittered that theres
what i call umor better feed that up to
a jury then ill git damages fer deforma-
tion er libel but howd ye know the string
come from a ball in my cabin howd ye
know that he demanded

   i compared it it was freshly cut with
a knife and tied with sailors knots
o-ho cried mankus with an ugly
sneer  the sock-foot agin the gum-
shoe sock-foot that sneaked out on the
tween-decks that night so ye sneaked into
my cabin too to find something ye could
hold up agin me-like a weasel i thought
ye was white xow i find yere a-
take care cautioned falkens a
sharp commanding note in his voice
 your eagerness to sidestep a regular in-
vestigation was the cause of my actions-
for which i make no apology and now
youve brought all this upon yourself by
your cold-blooded accusation of mr
letcher

  mankus shifted uneasily and gained
time by lighting a cigarette his great
hands were actually trembling as he did so


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   sure now miss dorthy he said ap-
pealing to the girl  you dont think it was
me that done it

  dorothy had seated herself at the op-
posite end of the table when mankus
addressed her she glanced quickly in his
direction  cant you see the case is just
as strong against you as it is against mr
letcher she cried eagerly you wont
refuse to help him now

  oh aye so thats the lay he
snorted closing one eye in a tremendous
wink and hooking his thumbs into his sus-
penders  guess im commencin to tum-
ble he cooked it up to accuse me sos to
clear letcher an git me to help him but
seein s i never done fer the skipper it
must a been letcher an thats the an-
swer to that question

  falkens lit a cigar with the slow delibera-
tion which was the only mark of his im-
patience and resumed his seat

   your denial mr mankus has little
weight he said slowly  theres more
evidence against you now than against
letcher-

   what of it demanded mankus hotly
 i know what i done an what i never
done you kin count me outen it an see-
in im boss here i aint a goin to leave
him git back because theres more evydence
agin him than anybody else barrin me

   not at all returned falkens smiling
 theres less evidence against letcher
than almost any one you could mention

   what ye givin as do ye mean to
say theres less evidence agin letcher than
agin the doc here fer instance or agin
yerself or old danl gaylord or miss
dorthy there-or ulquist or that darty
little devil of a steward omura fer in-
stance

   yes thats what  mean

  mankus grinned expressively and turned
to me wouldnt it beat ye doc he cried
holding his sides and rocking with laughter
 wheres the logic in that why  never
heard o sitch a think prove it prove
it

   certainly

   prove it agin the darty little devil of a
steward fer instance said mankus satiri-
cally selecting the one last mentioned

   very well omura had received a beat-
ing from the captain for failing to bring his
scotch on time its not going too far to
say captain jessup treated him like a dog
japanese-malays are the most revengeful
creatures living omura had access to all
the staterooms he more easily than any
one could have taken the spider-case from
mr letchers room and the string from
yours you force me to say some ugly
things mr mankus but come admit it
why couldnt it have been omura who
dropped the spider-case into the port even
more readily than it could have been mr
letcher

  thats so i exclaimed all but con-
vinced by this skilful manipulation of the
evidence  why havent we thought of
this before

   we aint thought of it before retorted
mankus bluntly  because it wont hold
salt water an thats the truth

   it seems plausible to me i contended 
 whats the matter with it

  worms an barnacles-thats whats the
matter-with it mr falkens-hes purty
darned smart to trim sails to fit that darty
little devil of a steward ani aint sayin but
what his lingo answers the helm an seems
ship-shape enough in fair weather why
its jist like a purty picture of an old-style
four-master spankin full rigged up the
channel before the trade wind but let a
squall strike her-shell veer galley-west
about an turn tuttle bein et through hull
an ribs with rat-holes mr falkens hed
make a top-notch lawyer but he aint no
sailor an that ye kin see without a glass
mankus grinned broadly as if at some
amusing recollection and continued

   ye see mr falkens ye aint studied
yer man that darty little devil of a
stewardd been homesick without the skip-
per raggin an man-handlin him he
growed fat offen it like jackies often duff
the trip before this the skipper jumped him
twicet as hard as this an the darty little
devil could o signed off at hong-kong

   but did he nit he tooken the pen
an signed on agin the skipper cussin him
the while an he only grinnin like mad
the night of the murder when i passed the
steerage abaft the galley there was the
green spiders



darty little devil curled up an swayin in
his hammock as happy as ye please

   besides the man i see shamblin to-
ward the tween-decks at eight bells was too
tall fer the steward omura he walks
quick like a cat an picks up his feet high
but this fella kind o shuffled along limpin
almost an seemed kind o old why in-
stead o bein that darty little devil of a
steward it might better a been old danl
gaylord hisself

  dad moaned dorothy under her
breath and i saw that her face was like
wax

   did ye speak miss dorthy asked
mankus turning toward her  no well
as i was sayin instead o omura the
person i see that night might better a been
mr gaylord-or mr falkens here from
the shape of the dome-

  mankus paused abruptly and his jaw
sagged as if a sudden great thought had
just come to him then he shook his head
slowly  i said it was letcher an stab
my guts if i dont stick to it hell never
git aboard this craft while i got a cartridge
in the gun 

  falkens turned suddenly as if about to
reply but dorothy forestalled him

   the person you saw that night was
myself said she a hard strained note in
her voice

   hay hay returned mankus blank-
ly his cigarette dropping from his mouth

   it was i repeated dorothy i wore a
long kimono and stooped over

   hay cried mankus sharply exhaling
with such vigor that the stuffing of his
cigarette blew out and scattered burning
over the table-cloth  ye wore a long
kimony an stooped- well now whod
a thunk it why i never heerd o sitch a
think i thought it was letcher all along
an now it was you why didnt i a
knowed it then i guess i never heerd a
sitch a- but what ye a givin us gal
you had somethink in ver hand i see-
 the spider-case of course

   mother of god then it was you as
done it

   yes continued dorothy in the same
expressionless tones  it was i who
dropped it in the port-hole

  for heavens sake miss gaylord
think what you are saying i exclaimed
but just then i remembered that i too
had seen her that night going toward the
tween-decks and the realization appalled
me

   this has gone too far said falkens
chokingly as he rose and rapped on the
table with a fist  what miss gaylord has
just said is false i-i dont believe her
i have good reason to think it was a man
who was guilty of this crime i-i-
dorothy glanced at him in vexation and
bit her lip to keep back a sharp retort
evidently she expected him to make some
important disclosure for she waited for
him to continue when he hesitated and
stopped in evident confusion her vexation
quickly changed to a look of deep scorn

   is that all you have to say mr fal-
kens she asked coldly

  falkens thus taken to task compressed
his lips and flushed as if he felt the irony
of her words but was determined to abide
by his decision

   that is all he returned shortly
l then i shall know what to think of
you she said scornfully as for myself
you all knew my feelings toward captain
jessup  -resolved to kill him i saw
mr letcher throw his spiders in the basin
and- but why detail the miserable
story i am the guilty person

  the fact of dorothys guilt did not seem
to concern mankus so vitally as the bare
suspicion of letchers had done mankus
lit a fresh cigarette drummed idly on the
table and actually grinned

   well now miss dorthy he said a
new note of respect in his voice as he eyed
her with undisguised admiration  if ye
done it then i guess ye must a had good
an sufficient cause to do it which it aint
up to us to question or throw in yer teeth
why if ye done it you was sure justified
that clears the little gal fore an aft t-gal-
lants to keelson come doc that theres
what i call good new

 it also clears mr letcher i reminded
this put a damper on his spirits for he
shrugged his shoulders and an ugly ex-
pression supplanted his grin as he realized
the truth of my contention


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   thats so he conceded grudgingly
staring hard at the opposite bulkhead as if
in profound thought  thats different
agin but i guess we cant git round that
there proposition-thats the answer to that
question somehow i cant git the idee
out o my dome that letcher croaked the
skipper him a bug-ketcher - poison-
bite-spiders-an jessup gone

   ye kin take my advice or leave it but
im strong fer not leavin him git back
aboard hell only stir up trouble agin
but now it was miss dorthy done it an
all along i thought it was letcher why
i guess i never heerd o sitch a think
wouldnt it beat ye doc he cried laugh-
ing explosively and slapping his chest  all
along i thought it was letcher an now it
was miss dorthy he he

  the horrifying confession of murder
which i had just listened to had startled me
considerably but as mankus talked i re-
volved it in my mind and began to see day-
light was it possible dorothy had be-
lieved that the man whom mankus saw
shuffling along toward the tween-decks with
something in his hand was her own father
if so her motives in attempting to assume
the guilt were obvious by her confession
she hoped not only to clear letcher a man
in whose fate she seemed vitally interested
but to shield her father and turn aside any
suspicion of him that might later arise in
the minds of any of us

  i now recalled dorothys anguish on sev-
eral occasions when the subject had been
discussed and when any new line of in-
quiry had been opened without a doubt
she had seen her father go toward the
tween-decks that night-or return from it

  i remembered also how daniel gaylord
had persistently declined all discussion of
the subject his nervousness when it was
referred to and his hasty retreats to his
cabin several times in the very midst of the
inquiry

  as for dorothys vexation at falkens i
knew not what to think suppose she
knew that falkens also had seen her father
go toward the tween-decks that night
falkenss refusal to shield him would natu-
rally rouse her anger for if the guilt were
allowed to rest on her shoulders she would

probably escape punishment but if it were
her father who should be convicted the se-
quel would tell quite another story

   was not quite certain either that man-
kus was as completely taken in by dorothy
as he allowed us to think it seemed to me
that mankus when accused of the crime
had shown too much confusion for a man
with a clear conscience mankus had not
been entirely frank with us he had kept
some conclusive bit of evidence in reserve
might even have manufactured a situation
for the purpose of damning letcher and
justifying himself in refusing to allow
letcher aboard

  if mankus himself were guilty that
alone would explain his great complacence
at dorothys confession his rollicking high
spirits marred only by the knowledge that
letcher must now be allowed to return

  a more interesting phase of the situa-
tion occurred to me what if mankus feared
george letcher not only as a rival for the
girl but because letcher was in possession
of some damaging testimony against him

   now about that boat said falkens
abruptly  weve wasted a quarter of an
hour in talk lacking bamboo for outrig-
gers well have to devise something else

  no we wont i exclaimed one
trip up the ladder to the top of the cliff
will furnish us with enough bamboo for ten
outriggers

  mankus snorted and interposed all sorts
of objections but finding himself ignored
he swaggered out on deck

  by the time i had prepared for my trip
he had concluded to accept conditions with
good grace for he returned and said af-
fably

   well doc i see yer dome is set on get-
tin that letcher back agin an nothink
wont change it no use to take the hard-
est way about says i and mebbe i kin
help ye he paused and looked about
 wheres the cap

   who

   wheres mr falkens

   hes down getting tools-here he comes
now

  mankus turned and faced him  ye
wont need them tools mr falkens he
said respectfully  jist now when  was
green spiders



a squinting into the main hatch i remem-
bers theres a chinee tub-boat stowed in
there all we got to do cap is rig up
blocks an tackles an hist her i wont
take my davy shell ride them fierce break-
ers cap but shes pretty deep keeled an
we can do wussn take a chanst i guess
for the next two hours the three of us
worked hard and when we had hoisted the
little tub to the deck rendered her sea-
worthy shaped an extra pair of- oars and
lowered her over the stern we turned in to
rest till daylight

  the question of who were to go on the
expedition was the first thing that en-
gaged our attention next morning falkens
seemed to take it for granted he and i
would go

   doctor are you ready he asked
after we had despatched a hasty breakfast
while mankus was out on deck collecting
tools

   see here  objected as dorothy went
out with a tray of dishes  we cant leave
miss gaylord alone with-

   thats so he exclaimed  i tried it
yesterday i thought i could trust-but it
wont do you must stay here vawter

  i had set my heart on the trip and we
finally compromised by matching coins i
won without further ado we walked aft
and i took my place in the little boat and
untied the painter

   so the cap aint a goin observed
mankus sticking his square head over the
rail  ye look sort o lonesome doc
whatd ye say if i was to offer to ply an
oar fer ye

  i hesitated to acquiesce on account of
his animosity to letcher but not wishing
to seem ungracious i told him to jump in
and come along if he thought letcher would
not take to the bushes at sight of him

  oh aye he grunted closing one
eye in a tremendous wink then he slid
down the rope and sprang aboard with a
dexterity and an agility i envied letcher
hell be tickled to death t clap lamps on
any one thats a bringin the grub wagon
letcher hes in the rocks at the tip of the
first pint of land did ye say mr falkens
a hundred strides up the beach we cant
miss him in a fog dont let nothink hap-

pen to the little gal cap id leave ye the
gun only-

   thats all right mankus called fal-
kens though i believed he was not par-
ticularly pleased with the arrangement
 as for the gun you keep it till you get
back

   thankee sir youre man enough t
take keer o her look what ye done t
the- he paused as if remembering him-
self  look what she done to the skipper
stab my guts if id admire to be in the
shoes of the next man wot tried it damned
if ever i see an uglier corp n him when he
come a lungin outn that berth all swellt
up so his laigs was like to bust outn his
drawers but i guess letchers elected for
the next one yoho theres the little
gal now so-long miss dorthy well
we back a bringin a precious cargo by
noon

  dorothy came quickly to the rail at
some distance from falkens and looked
down at us her realization that she was
to be left alone with falkens did not seem
to appeal to her ever since falkens had
discounted her confession of the murder of
jessup she had avoided him i had seen
her gazing at him with an expression i
could not define well it was a peculiar
mix-up and that was the truth

  mankus and i bent to the oars and soon
reached the outlet my impression that
falkens doubted the wisdom of allowing
mankus to go lingered in my mind and
just before a twist in the channel whisked
the ship from our sight i thought i saw
him waving to us frantically

  but when i sprang to my feet for a bet-
ter view i could see nothing and i came
to the conclusion i had been mistaken
after a short struggle with the billowing
surf we made open water and turned west
along the cliffs

  the breeze was extremely light and va-
riable the sea comparatively calm the sky
almost cloudless the early morning sun
beat fiercely hot upon our backs as the
elongated shadows which it threw in front
of the prow gradually contracted mankus
peeled off his shirt and fastening it to a
leadline dropped it astern

   look at the sweat run outn it already

doc  he cried  each man his own chink
laundry except them thats spliced an got
their gals along of them i learned this
here trick over to the gold coast bein a

not contemplatin matrimony that is to
say not the kind of matrimony where ye
got to fork over two bucks to a preacher
an all that sort o thing they do it fer
less up to chefoo on account of-

  he paused suddenly as if remembering
himself cocking his square head on one
side he turned and squinted several times
toward the sky

   shes a goin to be a scorcher of a day
doc he observed sagely  puts me in
mind of wunst i shipped before the mast
on a sail ship an we was becamed but i
disremember if it was in the little caymans
or along nigh trinidad id hate to be out
on the rocks right now like letcher with-
out no water to swig here goes 

  he opened the water cask we had
brought and took a long drink

   yoho that steadies the ballast an
sends the juice a running up into the to-
gallants to ketch every thimbleful o wind
but if ye stow away too much it slops
about like darty bilge want some doc
 no better go slow on it letcher 
need it

   im a savin some fer him hes a
camel besides whos a breakin their
backs at the oars-letcher not that guy
hes a loafin on the rocks mebbe laffin
at us a sweatin over the blades an all
along of him bein dern ass enough to lose
the boat yestiddy how he kin fool any
gal is moren i kin savvee - that four-
flusher that dung-heel

  the memory of george letchers short-
comings was evidently too much for him
for he tugged away viciously and it was
several minutes before he glanced round at
me again and asked quizzically

   doc was ye ever contemplatin- he
slowly closed one eye in a-tremendous wink
 contemplating what i inquired

   contemplatin matrimony o course
thems the words that follers along to-
gether aint they spliced side by side
like man an wife thats lingo any man
of thirty thats sound in the dome an duff

hatch kin understand aint it was ye
ever contemplating matrimony doc

   of course i returned frankly  ive
contemplated matrimony several times in
my life

   that is to say matrimony with a
view

   with a view to what i asked

   a view to marriage o course

   whats the difference its all the
same isnt it

   thats as ye might think he replied
biting a generous chew from a large plug
and shaking his head  some does and
some dont now take that dung-heel over
yonder to the rocks hes a contemplatin
matrimony but without no views so to
speak to marriage not that i holds that
up again him genrally speakin every
mans entitled to what he kin ketch an salt
down in his own private pickle-barrel un-
less his nets runs foul of another mans
who planted hisn first

   you stow away my words fer future
reference if ever he gits back to the ship
alive an sound in the dome hes a goin
to stir up trouble so thats the answer to
that question-why he aint never to git
back to the ship 

  the unlooked-for termination of his re-
marks filled me with vague uneasiness i
now noted that our boat was standing a
much greater distance from the cliffs than
was necessary mankus had done the
steering and by the time the point of the
promontory became visible fully half a
league of heaving blue lay between

  i accordingly backed water with my left
oar and pulled hard on my right with a
view to turning inshore but mankus with
superior skill and greater brawn easily
counteracted my efforts

   what ye doin doc he asked ge-
nially  we got to stand off a bit longer
till we kin squint along the beach an git a
proper survey of the lay of the land sos
not t run foul o the mutyneers but pres-
ently he rested on his oars and after sous-
ing himself with brine took a third gener-
ous pull at the water-cask 

   do ye know doc that fella falkens is
a wiz he observed speculatively with
more than a note of admiration in his voice
green spiders



 i guess i always claimed nobody between
marseilles an macassar was handier with
the tools than me but did ye notice him
when we was a tailorin the boat last night
hes a bear on them block an tackle too
longside o him you looked like a land-
lubber on yer fust voyage an i felt like
one

    now it seems queer t me a gal like
miss dorthy dont cotton t mr falkens
an him t her but thats the way he
dont pay no more attention t her than if
she wasnt there treats her like she was a
man either he aint interested in the fe-
males or else hes got a gal back home

    i guess miss dorthy left a lover or
two back home too he continued resum-
ing the oars  but thats different females
aint bothered with sich thinks its the
fella that kin throw the heftiest bluff at the
proper time lands em but cap falkens
lies steady to the gal back home an she
instead o feelin slighted is glad to be left
alone i guess its some sort o instinct
tells a girl whicht is the right guy fer her
ye wouldnt think to look at her she could
see any one but letcher but i knows what
shes a doin-shes makin up to him so
as to git me riled an jealous he paused
and took a fresh chew of sailors twist

    a funny thing this coortin game she
says to herself  that there peter mankus
-theres the upstandin figger of a man
fer me but hes a leetle too sure i got
to make him so jealous hell eat outn my
fist i got to play him like a trout keep
him guessin or hell likely lose interest an
dig out if things come too easy fer him
peter hes the man fer me

    thats what she says to herself so shes
been a playin up to letcher jist to make
me jealous thats the answer to that ques-
tion 

   he cocked his head round with that fool-
ish leer of his wherever a woman was con-
cerned and said

    ye know doc she calls me peterkin
when she thinks o me whadda ye think
-pe-ter-

    indeed i interrupted

  we were now clear of the promontory
and far enough on the other side to obtain
a glimpse of the narrow strip of beach our

boat was standing so far out to sea it
would have been almost impossible to see
letcher unless he were near the waters
edge but mankus evidently had no inten-
tion of rowing nearer

   there lays the beach he said swing-
ing our boat around  an yonder lays the
rocks above it kin you see letcher nit
letcher aint there hes gone skinned out
joined the mutyneers an sailed away we
better row back to the irene

chapter ix

the fight in the small boat

vaaxkus sent the blades ripping
through the water before i could real-
ize what he meant to do

   hold on i exclaimed  i dont un-
derstand i must have heard you wrong
 why its plain enough he returned
glancing roundat me and grinning letch-
er he aint there so after havin carefully
searched the beach an rocks were a going
back to the ship

   this is no search-this is brutal no
i cried with quickly rising anger  drop
that right oar-head for the beach im
going to land on it i believe letchers
there

   now looky here doc-

   do as i tell you-quick 

  mankus turned slowly and faced me
 why doc whats got into ye he asked
in an argumentative tone  do you guess
id lie to ye aint the beach bare aint
we squinted along it an seen that letcher
want there- theres facts aint it
thats logic all along i thought ye was
failin in with my views an now ye was
only foolin me all the time

   but i guess ye must be sick with the
heat the suns got into yer dome i
guess ill have t git ye back t the old
irene in a hurry an tell miss dorthy t
stick an onion plaster on yer adams apple
yer words comes out crooked mr fal-
kens hell know what ails ye when i tell
him-

   are you going to the beach or not
i demanded white with anger struggling
desperately to turn the boat inshore


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  mankus must now have realized i was
in earnest and no longer to be hoodwinked
or influenced by his words for suddenly
he dropped both his oars and faced me
again an ugly look on his face

   it pears to me yer spoilin fer a lick-
in he sneered  ye sass back like ye
thought ye was boss it aint wise fer a
sawbones t talk thataway t his captain
i guess ye dont recollect peter mankus is
now skipper of the irene statler peter
mankus late first mate and yere only
vawter the sawbones liable fer mutiny
yes sirree-liable fer mutiny-that theres
the civil answer to that qu-

   you didnt answer my question i
flung at him sharply

  oh aye i didnt hey he bawled
i didnt answer yer stinkin rotten skunk-
tail of a question hey he bellowed his
face turning purple with the sudden angry
rush of blood and the veins standing out
on his forehead oh aye ill answer
it yoho ill answer ityou shrimp
you four-flusher fer a couple o cash id
pitch ye in the brine an tell em ye went
crazy with the heat an drowneded yerself
fer another cash id twist yer runty neck
into the bargain till the goo run outn yer
beak an mouth an yer lamps popped out
like a squashed rat stab mv guts if i
wouldnt 

  by this time my anger had reached
white heat throwing caution to the winds
i jerked the board on which he was sitting
from under him and dumped him into the
stern across the water cask then i sprang
upright in the little cockle-shell of a boat
and struck at him savagely with a shore
anchor

  the blow caught him above the left ear
with considerable vigor and just as he rose
with a volley of profanity to grapple with
me i followed it with a nasty fluke-jab in
the bulging ribs of his hairy red chest he
sucked air like a stricken walrus and
sprawled under the seat upon the wooden
grating between the oar-locks-spitting
blood and cursing but before i could
knock him out what with the teetering of
the boat the awkwardness of my weapon
the shank of which became tangled in the
rope the difficulty of maintaining my bal-

ance and the fact that my feet constantly
slipped on the wet planks he managed to
scramble to his knees and with a cry of
rage hurled the water cask straight into the
pit of my stomach

  unfortunately i had just thrust out both
arms to prevent myself from pitching over-
board and therefore was unable to ward off
the blow there was no room in which to
sidestep without throwing my weight on the
narrow gunwale which would have capsized
the boat in short order and brought our trip
to an untimely end i tried to turn and
advance a hip but too late the missile
caught me squarely in the wind and re-
bounded between his knees

  the blowr was wicked enough but the
cask lacked weight for it was more than
half empty and i succeeded in retaliating
with an oar before pain and nausea over-
came me i reeled and collapsed half
stunned and woozy and the next thing i
remember i was grappling with the mate
in the bottom of the boat the bilge rush-
ing about and choking me the little cockle-
shell rocking from side to side and shipping
gallons of salt water over the gunwale

  the bilge had a nauseous reek of decay-
ing fish tar and dirty chinamen who for
ages had lived and slept and worked and
fished in the boat on the hoang-ho and
all the unspeakable refuse which had been
collecting for decades in the seams had now
soaked loose and was splashing up through
the planking to fill my hair mouth and
eyes with a putrescent and sirupy com-
pound while mankus struggled to gouge
me in the wind with the water-cask for-
tunately i still gripped the handle of the
oar and sometimes when the rock of the
boat threw me uppermost i managed to
deliver a telling blow

  the rising bilge floated the cask into the
bow beyond his reach and when he made
a grab for the anchor-ring i jerked my
feet from under him and we grappled

  ordinarily i should have been no match
for him but he was weak and groggy from
the blows of my oars and when we finally
broke away and staggered to our feet he
stood swaying a moment heavy-lidded and
then pitched drunkenly overboard by the
stern
green spiders



  his great bulk went down like a shot
and i weak and trembling sank to my
knees and lay heavily across the gunwales
my hands dragging limply in the water

  he came up choking and gasping a yard
astern and i saw a helpless piteous look
in his vapid fish eyes before he sank once
more

   wondered whether he would come up
again i wondered whether a leg an arm
or his head would be the first to appear
i almost hoped no portion of him would
appear but as my brain quickly cleared
i experienced a reaction when four sec-
tions of time had passed and three more
had dragged by i found myself beginning
to hope-to pray-that mankus would rise
again

  my insane anger had entirely passed it
had failed to survive the sight of him sway-
ing drunkenly helplessly in the boat just
before he pitched overboard and now the
utter folly of our argument anger and bar-
room brawl filled me with self-loathing

  john falkens had spoken wisdom when
he said that something of vastly greater
import than jessups murder had come into
the lives of us all when he urged us to sink
our private jealousies and bickerings and
combine our heads and hands for work on
the greater problem the fight for freedom
and now i realized that if we were to de-
vise a plan of escape from the entombed
ship mankus was too valuable an asset
to lose

  i had made the mistake of getting angry
falkens would not have done so i felt
too that he would have found a way to
reconcile mankus and letcher and unite
them in the work for the common welfare
yet i had only spilled the fat in the fire

  if mankus drowned i should be respon-
sible i had no real quarrel with mankus
i shrank from the burden of causing his
death besides that queer weak helpless
look of his just before he sank had been
too much and now even the bubbles
which marked the spot where he vanished
had ceased to rise

with a cry of dismay i sprang up and
hurled myself into the water down
down i swam till my right hand came in
contact with one of his boots his body
 argosy

was limp and pliant there was no struggle
left in him no sign of consciousness when
i dragged him to the surface shook the
water from my eyes and glanced around
i saw that the cockle-shell had drifted near-
ly fifteen fathoms and was headed out to
sea

  after no end of frantic work i succeeded
in towing him to it where i looped the
painter round his shoulders and tugged him
up over the stern

  the little boat having shipped several
additional gallons of brine in the process
my first task was to bale out then i set
about the work of resuscitation first i
resorted to all the feasible methods and
tricks known to medical science to dislodge
and express the water from his lungs and
induce respiration i had no pulmotor

  then with his legs still hanging over the
stern and his shoulders resting beneath the
seat i made the most of the cramped
quarters and worked his arms as method-
ically as i could from his sides up over his
head and back again it was no easy task

  half an hour passed he showed no spark
of life his face was like a plaster cast
without a stethoscope i could detect no
flutter of heart or pulse redoubling my
efferts i shook and kneeded him as vigor-
ously as i could it was no use

  dropping his arms i took a drink of
water and then returned to the work
when the limit of time which is usually
allowed such cases had passed i realized
that my efforts had been wasted and that
the only thing to do was to dump him over-
board long hours in the tropical sun had
pretty thoroughly robbed me of my vigor
and i found that i was unable to hoist the
heavy carcass from the floor of the boat

  he had been such an exceedingly well-
nourished individual every morning he
could tuck away nearly a dozen fried eggs
-cold-storage eggs at that-and follow it
up with a stack of wheats a foot high and
now it was i who had to suffer for his
greediness i tugged and tugged however
and just as i succeeded in forcing his shoul-
ders over the side i saw that a faint tinge
of color had crept into his face

   that was a near thing my friend i
said grimly when i had safely steered him


argosy and railroad mans magazine

through the fit of strangulation retching
and nausea essential to a speedy recovery
 youve been skating dangerously close to
the edge

  im a dyin doc a dyin he gurgled
wheezing and drooling and spitting brine

   rot

  a dyin - a dyin doc he groaned
coughing and striking his chest with his
huge fists

   sit up and try taking a few strokes at
the oars i told him

  he made a wry face and turned over on
one side

   i guess im done fer-i aint long to
live he said wheezingly as -he felt the
lumps on his head with his fingers and gave
vent to a series of the most heartrending
moans imaginable but when he found
that instead of being faced with approach-
ing dissolution he continued to improve
he ceased his absurd groaning and sat up

   my laigs is so weak jist like a cat
doc he informed me with an air of stupid
surprise  jist like an ornery slinkin
one-eyed cat

  i murmured my comprehension and ex-
pressed my sympathy yet upon reflection
i failed to see the exact application of these
words all specimens of the genus feline
which came within my knowledge were sup-
plied by nature with limbs as well muscled
tough and wiry as was needed for the pur-
suit of a most active existence one-eyed
cats in particular seemed singularly fa-
vored in this regard at least the only one
i had known was a crook-tailed thomas
with a very comfortable appetite and well-
developed predatory instincts who could
outmaneuver and outfight any two-eyed
god-fearing cat in the neighborhood and
could rake more garbage out of a can with
one lusty paw in a given time than any cat
i ever heard of

  the day was so extremely warm and
sticky however that i lacked the breath
to argue with him and i lay in the bottom
of the boat panting from my recent exer-
tions a piece of wet sailcloth over my head

   them biffs on my dome was pretty
fierce doc he said looking foolish  i
wouldnt never a drownderf thataway if ye
hadnt jumped me when i want a lookin

and all along i was jist a fooling with ye
doc was jist a foolin all along a tryin
ye out an i wouldnt never a dreamed o
beatin it back to the ship without landin
fer letcher any moren id a hurt a hair
o yer precious dome

   do you forget the threats you made
against my life i asked  the names
you called me-your rage

   jist byplay doc why thinks i heres
the doc a plannin to cut straight into the
beach in plain sight o them mutyneers
stead o crawlin along shore hid by the
rocks heres the doc without no more
plan n a bebby to keep from bein jumped
by them fierce mutyneers whod swipe his
little chinee tub-boat an turn him loose t
shift like they done letcher

   thinks i peter mankus has got t
guard the doc agin hisself peter mankus
has got t wheedle the doc into puttin back
round the pint out o sight before a look-
ing fer letcher that theres common
sense that theres logic that theres
wisdm

  hehad hauled in his shirt from over the
stern to wring the water out of it and at
each word he gave it an additional vigorous
twist

   so thats what i was a thinkin all
along he continued  but suddent as a
spankin jibbm ye hies up an biffs me in
the dome-like the tail of a runnin rat-
line yer two lamps a blazin an the holes
in yer beak stretched wide an a grabbing
at the air and all along i was only a fool-
in i guess i never heerd o sitch a think
doc i never heerd o sitch a think

  by this time mankus actually believed
that events had fallen out exactly as he
described them and i did not seek to con-
tradict him it was sufficient that on ac-
count of the great fright he had received
he was now tractable and willing to rescue
george letcher

  while mankus talked i glanced toward
the shore and found that our boat had
floated a considerable distance out to sea
during the hours we had wasted in bicker-
ing fighting and recovering the cliffs al-
most blended with the horizon and were
partly obscured by haze

  we had drifted in an easterly direction
green spiders



and the promontory where george letcher
was concealed seemed a mere speck the
shortness of shadows and the vertical posi-
tion of the sun showed that it was already
past noon both our watches had stopped
running on account of our plunge in the
ocean

  without further loss of time we rowed
to the eastern side of the promontory near
the point itere beaching the boat in a
sheltered inlet we clambered up the rocks
after a short unsuccessful search we re-
turned to the boat in the inlet to compare
notes

  we had found the spot where letcher
had passed the night to judge by the
marks of his shoes he had crawled from
his hiding-place down to the beach several
times that morning then he had walked
westward some hundred yards toward ulm-
quists camp if it had been letchers in-
tention to throw himself upon the mercy
of ulmquist he had for some unknown
reason changed his mind and darted into
a clump of scrub bushes near the foot of
the cliff from this concealment he had
been dragged only after a struggle the
marks of five pairs of feet including those
of ulmquist and the biggest of the negroes
told the story

   well doc said mankus sitting down
on his thick haunches and opening a case
of biscuit which we had brought for george
letcher  i claimed all along hed jin that
skunk utquist good riddance to bad rub-
bitch the hull pack on em says i lay to
at the grub doc better carry our ballast
a leetle higher up on the back trip an
wed oughta be a startin before the surf
gits any heftier

  by this time however  was mad clear
through and obstinate the failure of my
plan to accomplish my mission and return
hours ago to the comfort of the ship had
been caused solely by the mates folly
perhaps the loss of a good hot lunch was
mainly responsible for my present black
mood

  of course george letcher was probably
as well off with the crew as he would be
on the irene statler particular respect or
friendly regard for letcher i had not fie
seemed to have stolen a march on us all

so far as the girl was concerned though
 scorned to elevate him to the dignity of
a rival i began to foresee that he might
prove a much more important figure in the
final reckoning than  had at first been led
to believe

  furthermore the easiest thing for me to
do would be to leave him to his fate and
return as mankus now suggested to the
ship but would it be so simple a matter
to explain the reason of my failure to dor-
othy whose concern over his prolonged ab-
sence had been genuine

  this thought as much as my slumbering
anger against the mate and my impulse to
espouse any plan in direct opposition to his
own may have been responsible for my de-
cision

   out with the rest of that chow and the
water cask i said impatiently  out
with them and hide them away in these
bushes

   hey asked mankus stuffing his
mouth full of crackers  whats the lay
 im going to stay here

   oh come now doc that aint-

   oh yes it is

   but what you a goin t do

   what i set out to do after dark im
going over to the camp you go back to
the ship and tell mr falkens

  ah even in this civilized age it is fre-
quently a quick solution of difficulties to
tote a gun at ones hip i had removed the
gun from mankus while he was recovering
from his plunge and it now enabled me to
speak with entire authority

  oh aye he grunted jerking loose
the painter from the bush  if yer domes
sot on it thats the answer to that ques-
tion

  he inserted the oars in the locks and
shoved the boat into the water then he
glanced back hungrily at the half-finished
box of biscuits

   tell ye what doc give me three more
biscuits an ill bring grub enough fer two
right away but doc he cried with a
note of sincerity  recollect that skunk
ltquist aint got no love fer ye hes like
t cut yer windpipes at bolo-range go
slow doc jist supposin ye never was to
show up no more 


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  this whimsical reflection evidently
touched the chords of sentimentality in his
paradoxical make-up - chords with which
he was well supplied on occasion-and al-
most with tears in his voice he essayed to
plead with me again

   no doc it aint philosphy its like
a buttin yer dome into the jawr of a man-
eater shark into a school of jellfish that 
sting ye to death stab my guts if taint
better come along of me back t the old
irene the cap an miss dorthy-

  i bundled him into the boat and shoved
it vigorously through the surf then i
watched the powerful methodical strokes
of his oars till a bend in the coast-line blot-
ted him from my sight

  after all i meditated mankus bore me
no real grudge and i believed i could de-
pend on him to return with water and ra-
tions unless dorothy should chance to be-
tray too much solicitude for my welfare
yet it would take a pretty powerful jolt to
convince him that i was a rival to be
feared he would mistake her attitude for
anxiety over george letcher an anxiety
partly real partly feigned for he solaced
himself with the belief that she was  play-
ing up  to letcher just to  git him riled
and jealous

  in mankuss mind letcher was the goat
and therefore the rest of us would be
spared the effect of his peculiar jealousy for
some time rut in the future i foresaw
complications if mankus ever got it into
his  dome  that i was trying to win the
girl and had a fair chance of success i
should find him a powerful and a relentless
foe

  when darkness fell i went along the
rocks toward ulmquists camp it was a
nasty trip through marsh and jungle if
all was fair in love why must i be bound
by a code which george letcher as well as
mankus had already violated why was
i taking all this trouble to save an unwor-
thy rival for a girl whom i had hoped to
deprive him of later it was like betting
two rival poker hands i came to the con-
clusion that the time-honored adage  alls
fair in love was originally invented by
dishonor and shiftlessness to cover their
own weaknesses

  now comes the exciting part of my ad-
venture while floundering through a salt
marsh some distance inland i thought i
heard the sweep of oars this suspicion
was verified when i reached the neck of
the promontory near ulmquists camp
for instead of finding the two life-boats
there i saw but one boat

  at this point a low sand-bar fringed with
betel palms received the shock of the surf
and left a strip of comparatively calm wa-
ter between it and the fern-covered ledges
of rock these ledges rose by easy stages
to the foot of the cliff a mile inland

  ulmquist and most of the men had evi-
dently gone off in the long-boat leaving
poggio tack and omura to guard the sup-
plies and the jolly-boat which lay in the
angle of the sand-bar its painter fastened
to a stick of driftwood thrust in the sand

  wedged in a crevice of a handy rock
stood a soup kettle beneath it a fire of
driftwood and newly cut timber had nearly
burned itself out there remained only the
ends of a few green fagots and a generous
pile of embers the ruddy glow of which lit
up the faces of the three men who squatted
on blankets about it

  poggio was leaning against his sea-chest
the lid of which had been propped open a
few inches with a stick to make a head-
rest a ludicrously short clay pipe hung
from his yellow teeth and the soles of his
bare feet were stretched out toward the
fire tack who lay near him was naked
from the waist up he had scooped out a
snug hollow in the sand and spread his
blanket in it

  at present he was engaged in the divert-
ing pastime of chewing tobacco with great
gusto and squirting the juice upward in the
direction of the soup kettle and whenever
he succeeded in plastering its sooty sides
with trickling saliva he wagged his woolly
head and roared with tremendous glee at
the idea

  omura crouched at some distance his
little red dictionary peeped from his belt
he muttered to himself while he slowly
stroked the tawny fur of queechee the
ships cat which he had brought away with
him much against that fat and selfish crea-
tures will
green spiders



  i circled the fringing bushes and climbed
through the banks of tall fern till near
enough to hear what poggio was talking
about

  this i gathered ulmquist had just
taken letcher over to the point of the
promontory in the hope of forcing him to
disclose the whereabouts of the passengers
and the provisions which they had brought
with them the whole crew was already
suffering from a shortage of rations omura
was in particularly bad odor for stealing
an extra potato only to-night some tins
of salmon had disappeared and ulmquist
blaming omura had threatened to kill him

  most of the men feared to put out to sea
without additional rations they had cir-
cled the little island without finding a safe
anchorage natives or means of ascending
the cliff and the land that lay southward
seemed even more inaccessible than this
barren coast

   no tack said poggio as he refilled
his clay pipe with the unburned embers of
his last three smokes  cappa ulqueest
tella me we going stay here till we find de
grub or catcha five hundred pounda feesh
but i teenk i know why he wanta stay
here he wanta find de very pretty sig-
norina

  as this last profound observation of pog-
gios was delivered without undue gesticula-
tion and in a low tone between short puffs
at his pipe and as tack was paying very
little attention to what the italian was say-
ing but was intent upon his own edifying
avocations he did not hear it

  to tell the truth tack had just succeed-
ed after two disheartening misses in
splashing the exact center of the kettle with
an enormous gob of the red-brown juice
which trickled swiftly in five rivulets and
fell upon the hot coals of the fire with an
explosive hiss

  this astonishing performance which il-
lustrated aptly strikingly and triumphant-
ly the truth of four or five laws of physics
appealed so irresistibly to tacks well-
developed sense of humor that he placed a
sable fist between his two rows of ivories
forthwith and wagged his head in ecstasies
while the crystal tears rolled down his
ebony cheeks

  dats a ringer dats a ringer he
gasped as soon as he could recover his
breath  ah reckum dat makes seben
drinks ob gin yo owes me did yo see
dat monstorious ringer oh man

   sheesa no looka lika ringer to me
observed poggio squinting his eyes and
shaking his head gravely  sheesa too
iowa down

  oh sho man dats de trickul
dats a fac ah reckum dat gob ob juice

    alla right you tack alia rightpog-
gio hastened to agree an ingratiating note
in his voice and compliance in his gestures
 sheesa joost one fine ringer now you
going to shoot for me one bottle de red
wine one roasta pig with de garlic and one
beeg fat cheese

  at this enumeration of appetizing viands
tacks face convulsed spasmodically in a
series of the most remarkable grimaces im-
aginable and sitting up suddenly he
pressed with both hands in the region of
his stomach

   say boy doan yo tantalize dis yeah
niggah dataway yo heah me he ejacu-
lated sharply

   aint you going shoot me for one beeg

his eyes from the potency of the nicotin in
his clay pipe  one beeg feast so quick

bif villim merriam rouse

for more than ten years the village of
belle riviere had called him jacques
of the thick head not to his face
certainly for jacques grondin commanded
respect in spite of the uncomplimentary
title which his own people had given him a
man who could put a barrel of flour on his
shoulder without visible effort was worthy
of respect even if he did have less common
sense than any other french-canadian be-
tween montreal and the gulf at thirty
jacques had become a proverb in his own
parish

  jacquess lack of sense by him realized
fully had troubled him more or less for a
long time but on a certain day in the
middle of a cold winter it became a danger
it threatened his happiness as one of the
black storms of the north threatens the
white world - impenetrable omnipotent
bringing darkness and bone-searching cold

  he stood upon the heights overlooking
belle riviere in winter sunlight which
failed to sweep the shadows out of his
thoughts and hoped against certainty for
some little trick of fate to relieve him he
knew that he was going to do a thing which
might easily rob him of that which he most
desired

  a hundred feet below lay the village its
stone walls pink and pale-green and white
according to the fantasy of the painter and
the odds and ends of paint which must be

kept from waste the roofs buried under
snow except for their dormer windows
slanted gracefully heavenward and little
trailing wreaths of smoke sauntered from
broad chimneys

  grondin loved the village almost as much
as he loved the blue laurentians at his
back and the ice-locked st tawrence
which went out toward the sea past the
village and the misty heights of cap tour-
ment he was brother to the wind and
snow and the keen cold air what mis-
fortune to be afflicted with a disease of the
spirit which repeatedly weakened him in the
face of necessity-thus ran his thoughts

   cest dommage he muttered as he
turned on his snow-shoes

   what is a pity my jacques

  the question came from behind him and
in a voice which to his ears had ever
shamed the chimes of ste anne de beaupre
he turned quickly celeste rigaud to
whom he was betrothed was almost near
enough to touch him-with a sparkle in
her black eyes and red in her cheeks and
a smile like dawn she wore little caribou
chaussom and a boys mackinaw jacket in-
stead of the flimsy moccasins and fancy
coats which most of the village girls
affected

   mon dieu he exclaimed  you have
learned to put your feel down like feathers
-or was i asleep




argosy and railroad mans magazine

   dreaming of your good luck my
jacques she suggested moving to his side
 is it true as they say that you have
bought a hundred cords of pulp wood for
three dollars less than the regular price

   yes he refused to meet her eyes
preferring to stare off into the blue-and-
white regions south of the st lawrence
 old didace parent was glad to sell he
made a just profit this year it is almost
impossible to get men and teams to bring
wood out of the mountains-and i have
them

  what luck for us

   but -grondin drew a breath that
vas very nearly a groan- there is the
matter of henri painchaud to be con-
sidered

  jacques her voice rang sharply
 what folly are you going to do now

   you see he began trying to get hold
of a much-rehearsed explanation  pain-
chaud is not young any more and hehas a
very old father and mother who are so
feeble that they need a hired woman to
look after them he has had bad luck
and-

   tell me the worst of it first she de-
manded  are you going to give him the
wood

   but no  protested grondin  not at
all i am merely going to turn over the
contract to him so that he can make the
profit

   i thought no one but you had the
horses and men to handle it

   butyou see he can take mine-

   dieu seigneur it is a miracle of the
good god that you have a house and clothes
to wear

   painchaud has had bad luck this year
he repeated  and his father and mother
are very old what could i do

   it is true that heaven has given you
no sense at all the storm he had feared
was gathering  charity yes but this
is more folly than i believed even you
knew how to commit

   it will help him through a hard win-
ter persisted grondin  there are doc-
tors bills-

  jacques grondin she struck his
bulging chest with a tiny mitten until he

looked her in the eyes  can he pay you
back

   eh bieril he might

   he might mon dieu listen to me
never after this day will i celeste rigaud
speak to you if you do this thing

  misery filled him like a great sickness
she was terribly angry or she would not
have said it and he knew that the anger
would pass but he also knew that she
would keep to her word even though it had
been spoken when rage had made her forget
their love

  he hesitated-for not to lie was a part
of his madness-and as he hesitated with
blood pounding in his temples and a mist
before his eyes celeste faded and in her
place he saw undersized henri painchaud
his cheeks sunken beneath a weeks stubble
and his eyes with the look of a wounded
rabbit

   painchaud is not a strong man -
grondin licked dry lips- and he has had
bad luck

  the mist cleared away and he saw
celeste again - celeste whose warm red
mouth had said it would not speak to him
the wrath that had darkened her face had
departed leaving a questioning speculative
look

   i said that  celeste rigaud woyld
never speak to you after this day-is it
not true

   my dear he pleaded huskily  pain-
chaud is a little fellow-

   scoundrel  she cried  i am not talk-
ing about this painchaud if you do not
marry me to-day how can celeste rigaud
answer the questions at the altar tell me
that

  not in all respects was jacques grondin
without sense he swept her up in his arms
with snow-shoes dangling careless of who
might be upon the roads-her arms laced
about his neck

   oh my jacques of the thick head
she murmured  it is a terrible thing to
love a man like you-but i cannot help it 
so they were married before the sun went
down that day and belle riviere which
insisted upon knowing all the business of
everybody had something to talk about for
months
jacques of the thick head



  the gossips shook their heads certain-
ly no good could come of such a helter-
skelter marriage between a man with no
sense and a girl whose temper was known
to be that of the chat sauvage even if the
parents were willing

  for a time it seemed that the gossips
were to be confounded and jacques gron-
din prospered and all went well he and
his wife wore fur coats such as few along
the cote de beaupre could afford and they
kept a horse which was used for driving
only

  it may have been that this prosperty was
due to grondins having no opportunity to
make a fool of himself for a time anyhow
five years from his marriage he wrote his
name on the back of a note for a friend
and suffered as most such adventurers do
his house-and even the horse-went to
made up the sum to be paid

  to the bitterness of the things which
celeste had to say he could make no reply
all through one summer night she stormed
at him because of his folly and he could
do nothing save sit at the opposite side of
the room and pretend to smoke

  of course he would have given an arm
to spare her the privation and the hard
work which must result and he believed
that his strength would in time win back
what had been lost but he felt now that
there was something stabbing deeper into
her heart than the physical loss it was
as though she had come to feel contempt
for him-really to consider him such a fool
as the shrewder men of the neighborhood
thought

  he knew that he could not help his folly
fbr it was as deep-seated as a disease of the
lungs and he did not know how to explain
his feelings to her

  after that long night of reproach the
fortunes of the family grondin remained
stationary or went lower if they moved at
all madame did not lose her dark and
vivid beauty and the great strength of
jacques became if anything better knit as
he drew into the prime of manhood but it
seemed that the two of them were like
horses which do not pull together they
made no progress and into the mind of
grondin came more than once and with

  sadness the words of celeste on their wed-
ding day  it is a terrible thing to love a
man like you

  at last jacques conceived a plan quite
patterned according to the direct and sim-
ple working of his mind which would at
least give him a start toward his old posi-
tion of independence two days march
back into the mountains he took a contract
to cut an amount of wood which needed
three mens labor during the winter he
would do this alone and thus by the sheer
power of his back and arms and the en-
durance of his lungs he would accumulate
more than three years savings in one
winter

  without protest at leaving the village
celeste went with him to the camp where
they were to live alone although she knew
that she could not expect to go down to
belle riviere to mass more than two or
three times during the next ten months

  their camp was larger and more com-
fortable than that of the average wood-
chopper the single room was fitted with
a well-built table at one end and a broad
bunk at the other under the roof and in
lieu of a ceiling a thick mass of evergreens
had been plaited and laid upon poies so
that nearly all of the heat from the stove
was conserved the logs of the walls were
hewn flat on the inside and whitewashed
to a satisfactory degree of cleanliness

  celeste seemed at least resigned to the
winter and jacques whose ax rang from
the first break of dawn until early dark-
ness was of necessity occupied mainly by
the needs of his body for food and sleep
one day was like another as the weeks
passed and at length with february the
time drew near when teams would arrive to
draw out the many cords of wood ranked
up near the cabin then when it appeared
that the winter was to end tranquilly and
exactly as jacques had planned the monot-
ony of their life was broken

  in storm and fair weather celeste carried
 hot dinner to her husband in order that
he might save a half-hour of working time
one clear still day she came rather more
hurriedly than usual and jacques knew at
first sight of her face that there was news

 after you have eaten she said setting


argosy and railroad mans magazine

his dinner-pail down upon a stump  come
v-ith me to the north of the camp-some
one has been chopping there all the morn-
ing

   chopping he echoed  but it is full
of young poplar there and theophile
bedard of whom i took this contract said
he would not have any of it cut for five
years more

  truly mme grondin permitted
more than a touch of sarcasm to creep
into her voice  perhaps you will refuse
to believe that any one is wicked enough
to steal that poplar

   it could be done replied grondin
slowly  drawn down by the road that
goes on the other side of grande montagne
and no one would be any the wiser

 what are you going to do about it
stop it he answered with decision
and as soon as he had eaten they set out

  before they had traveled a quarter of an
hour ax-blows came ringing out of the
forest and in a few minutes more they
rounded a little knoll and saw a red-shirted
chopper who had already cut down a dozen
of the valuable poplars he stood half-
facing toward them and grondin recog-
nized a man called pierre gagnon of belle
riviere--a man given to dealings which
had several times brought him in danger of
jail

  telling celeste to remain out of sight
grondin walked toward him with no effort
at concealment a twig broke under one
of his snow-shoes gagnon paused with his
ax in mid air guilt written plainly on his
face he let the ax down and stood with
its head resting upon one of his bottes
sauvages

   sacrc he swore  jacques grondin
 yes acknowledged jacques  how
do you happen to be cutting poplar on the
land of theophile bedard

   bedard awkwardly  does this land
belong to bedard

   it does what are you doing here
 there are three of us in a camp on the
other side of grande montagne - were
going to cut sixty cords for a man in ste
anne de beaupre gagnon was recover-
ing from the effects of the surprise  what
have you got to do with bedards wood

   ive been here all winter working for
him

   alone

   yes he did not think it necessary to
mention celeste gagnon grew more and
more assured

   name of the devil  he exclaimed  i
dont know anything about bedards land-
this is where were supposed to chop and
im going on with it

  you will stop now said grondin
quietly

  he slipped his feet out of the snow-shoe
harness and advanced gagnon took a step
backward and flung up his ax then
jacques who had expected just that leaped
and caught the helve as the shining blade
descended toward his head he sent the
ax flying twenty feet away and seized gag-
non by the shoulders-had the man meant
murder or had his movement been merely a
threat

  for a moment he shook him until his
head flopped on his shoulders then al-
most gently he lifted pierre gagnon and
set him down with his face toward the
direction of grande montagne

   go back to your camp he com-
manded  and if i see you or the others
chopping here ill - ill treat you worse
than this

  without a word gagnon shuffled off
while even in his own ears grondins words
sounded foolish like the threat of a small
boy and when he again faced celeste he
read confirmation in her eyes

   mon dieu she cried  a man tries
to kill you and you shake him thank
heaven he will suffer when bedard knows
of this

   but protested jacques avoiding her
gaze as they turned toward home  gag-
non you understand has a dozen children
theophile bedard is a hard man- -he would
send him to prison because of the wood 

   prison certainly

   but-

   jacques  celeste stopped and pulled
at his sleeve until he faced her  for ten
years i have endured your folly you
might have been as rich as bedard and
instead you are poor are you going to
send word to him by the teamsters when
jacques of the thick head



they come-he will undoubtedly give you
a reward-or are you going to let your
thick head do us another injury

   i dont know he answered slowly
and for the first time he admitted his dis-
satisfaction with himself  i wish i were
not such a fool 

    it is the end for us she said bitterly
 my father is still living and i have a
home 

  in silence they walked back to the camp
and while celeste went inside jacques
turned to the pile of firewood and worked
furiously he had no heart to go back to
his chopping and he could not remain still
for the second time in their lives there was
a sharp division of their ways and now his
instinct told him there would be no sur-
render on the part of his wife

  it was true that she had endured much
yet he did not see how he could have done
differently from the time when he had be-
friended henri painchaud to the present
day even the man whose note he had
signed had been in desperate need and
thus filled with impotent regrets the after-
noon wore on to a close

  it was dusk and grondin had driven his
ax into the chopping block preparatory to
going in for his supper when the clatter
of snow-shoes striking against each other
caught his ear he looked up to see a man
staggering toward him from the edge of the
clearing the man was old as evidenced
by the grayness of the beard that brushed
his chest and he was either ill or hurt or
starving for he swayed at each step his
head rolled helplessly and his arms hung
limp and powerless but in spite of his
condition he managed to drag by means of
a rawhide harness about the shoulders a
loaded sled

  grondin ran toward him and at the first
touch of his hands the old man collapsed
sinking down in a heap upon his snow-
shoes jacques slashed away the harness
and carried him into the cabin where
celeste after the first exclamation of sur-
prise made ready their bunk as grondin
put him down gently he spoke one word
 furs and then broke into a babble of
delirium which had to do with the far
north and long marches and dogs that had

had to be killed after a fight with a wild-
cat

   a trapper said jacques after the
man had leen undressed and wrapped in
blankets  many of them come down past
grande montagne at the end of winter-its
a short route but a hard one

  look at his face celeste touched
lightly a small patch of flesh not covered
by matted hair and beard  he has fever
-some kind of a sickness and the man
is half-starved

  in the woods there is one kind of sick-
ness which tries the souls of men more
than any other if this stranger was
stricken with the dread scourge of smallpox
then those who helped him risked their
lives jacques and celeste looked at each
other with the same fear and the same
question in their eyes

   i dont know said jacques in reply
to her unspoken question  but if a red
rash comes upon his body then god help
us

   whatever it is he must be taken care
of said celeste as she turned to the stove
where supper was cooking  it is our
luck

  grondin remembered the sled outside
and in the growing darkness he unloaded
it of two heavy bales and a canvas sack all
of which he carried into the cabin the
sack contained nothing but a meager cook-
ing outfit and a piece of salt pork big
enough to make one bite for a hungry man
but the bales brushed free of snow and
inspected in the lamp-light set the heart
of jacques grondin pounding

  celeste he whispered this man
has a fortune in furs silver fox and mink
and otter such as i never saw before

  she gave up a vain attempt to make the
sick man swallow some soup and shrugged

   the fox skins alone are worth a for-
tune jacques insisted if he lives he
wont have to work any more

    eh bieti she replied listlessly  that
is nothing to us

   no agreed her husband as he sat
down to the supper which she carried to the
table  nor would i change places with him
for if i ever saw the mark of death its on
his face now

  they were silent after that celeste sit-
ting with her hands in htjr lap and making
ro effort to eat as for grondin his great
body demanded food but he was no less
miserable than his wife more so perhaps
for he felt that all the blame for the breach
that had been made in their love belonged
lo him

  the good taste had gone out of the
food quickly he reached for his pipe-
and became motionless with it half-way to
his lips some one was lifting the latch
on the cabin door a click had caught his
ear then he saw the latch raised carefully
and even as celestes breathed  jacques
came to him the door burst open and what
seemed at first seemed like an avalanche of
men swept inside

  grondin leaped to his feet the men-
there were three of them-stood poised in
the middle of the room one was pierre
gagnon one was another worthless fellow
cf the same type named maurice laplante
and the third was a certain character of the
st lawrence called black matthieu a
smuggler people said although he had
never been caught he was the first to
speak

   where are the furs he demanded

   what furs asked grondin seeking a
little lime

  his rifle was on the other side of the
room hung over the bunk where the
stranger lay his knife and belt were on
the peg with his cap back of the stove but
each of the three visitors had knives and
the hand of matthieu was upon his

  you know what furs he barked
 we saw the old man when he stopped
here-and afterward laplante remembered
him for a trapper of belle riviere what
would a trapper have but furs

   theyre hidden under the bunk gag-
non shouted before jacques could speak
 lets get them and get out-nobody
knows what disease the old fellows got

  at the cry from gagnon black matthieu
turned his head only for a second did he
take his eyes from grondin but that second
was enough to give the giant his chance

  he caught black matthieu by the belt
and the collar of his packet and swung him
aloft until his back brushed the thatched

ceiling jacques felt the knife rip harm-
lessly through his shirt and then he hurled
his burden straight at maurice laplante
whose arm was already raised to strike
the two of them hit the log wall with a
thud that jarred the building and sent down
a rain of dried bits from the fir branches

  at ihe prick of a knife-point in his flesh
jacques whirled-to see a stick of firewood
in the hands of celeste come down upon
the head of gagnon the man dropped
face downward and the weapon slid from
his fingers

   celeste cried grondin between hard-
drawn breaths  you saved my life

   perhaps she sat down rather weak-
ly although there was no hint of weakness
in her flashing eyes  but it will have to
be saved again if you dont tie those pigs
up the one who looks most like a villain
is already beginning to stir

  black matthieu was trying to sit up
grondin snapped a coil of rope from the
wall and bound him hand and foot then
he tied up the others and set all three with
their backs against the wall

   parbleu he exclaimed  what a
foolish thing for them to do

   foolish repeated his wife  foolish
when theres a fortune to be had for the
taking

  to this grondin made no reply he sat
down on the bench by the table blowing
little spirals of smoke from his pipe and
watching the prisoners gradually they re-
covered full consciousness but no one of
them spoke it was celeste who broke the
silence

   ill start for belle riviere at day-
beak she said  while you keep watch
and take care of the sick man ill send
back help from the first camp on the way
and well have these fellows in jail before
the end of a week

  jacques did not reply instead he got
up and gave a drink of water to the man
in the bunk who neglected through the ex-
citement had grown more restless in his
delirium

   theyre going to jail arent they
the voice of celeste was like steel  tell
me that 

  grondin lifted a griddle from the stove
jacques of the thick head



and put a coal to his pipe he gazed down
into the scowling face of black matthieu

    it seems hard to put a man in jail

 truly

   at her tone jacques wriggled he was
 apologetic miserable but impelled by a
 pity which mastered him

    gagnon has children as i told you he
 said  laplante is a young fellow and
 they would take the best part of his life
 for a thing like this as for black matthieu
 -man dieu he is a tough bird but cer-
 tainly he has courage

    courage so you admire the black-
 guard you will invite him to try robbery
 and perhaps murder again to-morrow

    but no jacques puffed furiously at
 his pipe  ill go over to their cabin to
 see if they have a rifle then ill put the
 old man and his furs on the sled and well
 start they wont dare to attack me in
 daylight as i shall have at least my own
 rifle and by night well be safe

    marvelous exclaimed celeste  me
 i am going to start for my fathers house
 at dawn and leave you to your folly for
 the present im going to sleep behind the
 stove

   gagnon laughed grondin got up delib-
 erately and lifted his open hand as though
 to strike the prisoner across the face then
 he let the arm fall and turned away

    hit him said black matthieu sober-
 ly but jacques shook his head and sat
 down again by the table to smoke and
 watch his wife as she made a bed of
 blankets on the floor

   she lay down and after a long time he
 knew that she slept he got up walking
 on tiptoe and filled the stove he gave
 another drink to the sick man before he
 went back to his seat

   in the dim light of the oil lamp which
 he had turned down jacques saw that
 his prisoners were apparently dozing their
 heads sunk on their chests he resisted an
 impulse to loosen the ropes that bound
 them telling himself sternly that he was
 growing to be more of a fool every day

   certainly his wife was justified in going
 back to her fathers home he had lost her
 just as he had failed in everything if it
 were not for her safety and the furs he

 would let the robbers loose-let them take
 what revenge they wished on him he had
 neither desire for life nor courage for the
 future

  he looked drowsily at his big silver
watch and saw that it was midnight that
was the last thing he remembered until a
kind of thrill went through him-one of
those silent warnings that sometimes strike
mysteriously into the sleep of a man and
bring him up from the depths of fatigue
with every sense at the alert so jacques
grondins muscles were set for action even
as his ears filled with the sound of shuffling
feet and quick breathing he opened his
eyes upon a battle going on almost within
reach of his hand

  black matthieu was locked in the arms
of gagnon and laplante who were op him
like dogs on a wounded bear all three
had got their knives again - they were
treading underfoot the ropes with which
they had been tied matthieu held the
others for the moment but blood streamed
from a cut on his head and his knife-hand
was raised and helpless in the clutching
fingers of laplante they were still for an
instant straining then steel flashed against
matthieus dark shirt and a blade drove
deep into his side he went backward
pulling the other two clown with him

  by that time grondin was on his feet
he reached down and his broad thick
hands closed upon the necks of laplante
and gagnon he lifted the men up with
their tongues lolling from opened jaws and
brought their skulls together with a crack
like the report of a pistol they sprawled
into a corner and lay still

  jacques knelt and as he lifted the head
of black matthieu celeste reached his side
with a tin cup of water and a bottle of
whisky blanc she began to cut away the
shirts of the wounded man his lids lifted
slowly and an expression that was almost a
smile softened his face

   youre a good fellow grondin  he
whispered thats why i was - a - a
fool

   you save my husband said celeste
 i woke up just as they got the knives-
and saw

  name of a name swore grondin
	argosy and railroad mans magazine

brokenly as he lifted matthieu and passed
a bandage around his body  you very
nearly got yourself killed my friend and
i am nearly of a mind to send those two
devils to jail after all

  a smile sparkled about the eyes of
celeste and the wounded man grinned in
spite of his evident pain

   tie them up now he advised faintly
 or you wont have a chance

  he had just finished when celeste called
him in a voice strangely gentle to the
bunk the sick man lay now with the light
cf reason in his eyes but upon his face was
that dim grayness which is unmistakable to
one who has once seen death

  jacques he breathed in a voice so
low that they had to bend down to hear
grondin brought the lamp trying in vain
to learn what former acquaintance was hid-
den behind that tangle of dirty gray beard
and hair

   my lungs jacques said the dying
man  not smallpox 

   who are you asked grondin

   me i am henri painchaud the
wood-ten years ago-

   henri

  but yes always i have dreamed of
doing something for you jacques keep
the furs and le bon dieu bless-

  the benediction remained half-spoken
for henri painchaud was called to travel
the dark road which grondin himself might
have taken that night but for black
matthieu

  jacques turned away fumbling meehan-
ically for his pipe he did not see the
whitewashed walls of the cabin he scarcely
felt the touch of his wifes hand upon his
arm for the first time in his life men had
praised him to his face-one of whom had
been about to go to the good god and who
must therefore speak truth

  my jacques the words of celeste
came to him through a ringing in his ears
 will you believe me when i say that
black matthieu and henri painchaud have
put light in my soul it is my head that
has been thick these many years

the manner in which it is said

the simpler a man can be in his greatness the greater he is and the simpler the expres-
sion of a truth the more universal its appeal principally because it is the more easily
understood therefore since fame is measured largely by the number of people one
can get to noticc ones existence it would seem to be of first importance that the aspirant for
recognition make himself as understandable as possible so that the most of the people will
the more easily be able to appreciate what he is trying to do or say

    which applies to stories as much as to anything else

    style in writing as with style in clothes is merely a matter of taste but-to instance
the most prevalent inclination of all sorts of writers-it has always seemed to me that when
a man feels the need of long-winded paragraphs rather loud-mouthed metaphors and pon-
derously syllabled words to give vitality to the tale he is trying to tell he is in much the
same case as the south sea islander who sticks a ring through his nose to draw attention to
himself the south sea islander unquestionably gets the attention he craves but the ring
through his nose actually gets more attention than he does and every one will admit that
the nose would be a much better nose without the ring

     the more we know the more we know how little we know

    no truth could be much simpler or more mightily true than that it is credited to
socrates the foremost of the ancient grecian wiseacres who by the way never wrote a
single line he said a great deal however and said most of it better than it had been said
before or has been since plato wrote down as much of it as he could remember and proved
himself not only the exponent of an enduring philosophy but a first-class reporter and press-
agent as well nevertheless even if plato had written nothing else his account of the death
of socrates would surely have immortalized them both not because it is garnished with
grandiloquence and erudition but because it is a simple story simply but most eloquently
told

    in the nakedness of simplicity and naturalness there is a world of power adornment
of any sort is always a confession of weakness

 chapter xviii-continued

 the urge of a dream

as mary ann gazed down upon the form
of her husband he looked so gigantic
stretched on the ground she wished
she had married a smaller man or that she
had more than a womans strength for
she had determined to get him upon her
horse

  the poor beast was almost dead for want
of water there was no near-by stream
and the animal had had nothing except the
moisture that he had licked as he grazed
on the leaves and short grass that grew close
to where he was tied mary ann had not
dared to hobble him and leave him even
that much freedom because she felt that
in the horse lay their only hope of reaching
nacogdoches

  she attempted to rouse fred from his
stupor but it was useless she then got
to her feet and covered her shaking limbs
with the garments which had been over her
husband during the night she ate break-
fast which made a sad hole in the provi-
sions she had brought with her but she
was ravenously hungry and now that she
had got the chilled blood to circulating
in her veins she felt equal to anything
however another look at fred made her
doubt her powers

   still she comforted herself  the
good god who has helped me so far will
not desert me now only i wish i had two
horses instead of one

  she brought her own horse close beside
fred and roused him sufficiently so that he
could aid her a little and so with infinite

this story began in the

difficulty she succeeded at last in getting the
body of the man she had so unselfishly cared
for upon the back of the horse once
there she tied him in place she knew that
she was hurting the poor sufferer but he
seemed to realize that she was doing all she
could for his benefit because he made no
outcries and seemed to strive to wince and
groan as little as possible

  sometimes he would open his eyes and
look vaguely about him but there was no
recognition for her or anything else in their
glassy depths the struggles of mounting
had caused freds wounds to break open
and mary ann was terrified to see the wid-
ening spots that soon completely covered
the bandages

  however she strove not to look at them
and leading the horse she turned her face
toward home at the first stream she wa-
tered the poor animal and resumed the jour-
ney she had her compass and felt sure
that it would prove a trusty guide but
the big question was could fred live to
make the journey

  she hoped so she earnestly prayed so
but at such times the candle of faith burns
low and mary ann was far from being a
devout person she had learned to pray
as she had learned to read and do sums in
arithmetic but even thetis carrington had
found fault with the girls knowledge of
mathematics

  the day wore on mary ann was certain
that she suffered more than the man tied
on horseback beside whom she tramped
but alas she did not have the blessed
balm of unconsciousness to relieve her suf-
ferings

  when the sun began to reach such a posi-
tion that traveling beneath its rays seemed
dangerous mary ann unstrapped her pre-
cious burden and eased his descent to the
ground she was enraptured to find that
the wounds bled very little during this oper-
ation she hoped she was learning better
how to handle her patient and she was
for in the cool of the afternoon when she
again bore her burden to his place upon the
horse she found that she had managed mat-
ters with much greater comfort to fred and
with less strain to herself

  all that afternoon and all that long night
they went forward there was a little moon
which came up early and aided her in find-
ing her way across the prairies not a
single human creature did she see although
often in the thicket she would startle small
animals and in the open she passed several
droves of wild ponies and more than once
encountered feeding herds of buffalo which
took not the least notice of her

  in the early morning more dead than
alive but with an infinitely thankful heart
she arrived in nacogdoches no one was
awake yet and she went unescorted toward
the inn

  the man bound to the horse was still
burning with fever and looked as though he
had been dead buried and dug up but he
was still alive and mary ann realized that
whether he lived now or died she had done
what she could

  she hitched the horse and staggered into
the big room

    help help  she cried

  several men who were sleeping here
sprang to their feet one of them caught
at her as she swayed drunkenly on the
threshold to mary ann in her pitiful
state it all seemed a dream for colonel
carrington was beside her and so were
hamilton and the two rogers boys she
would not have been surprised if neil had
also appeared

   why how did you escape the old
man cried

   escape she repeated as she almost
fainted in the old friendly arms

  yes werent you abducted hamilton
cried

   abducted mary ann muttered

 abducted everybody is crazy fred
-outside-somebody help me-h-e-l-p
then unconsciousness wiped out every-
thing

chapter xix

in the balance

yyhen mary ann came to herself the-
tis carrington was bending over her
the first words to escape the young
womans lips were  where is he

   where is who dear

   fred-my husband

   hes quite safe child be quiet lie
still you have been very ill lie still
thetis attempted to hold the girl upon the
bed

   where is he alary ann cried again
struggling to get up

   hes over there thetis waved vaguely
 the doctor says he will get well you
are the one-you have scared us far more
than he has

  i mary attempted to remember
abducted she muttered  who is ab-
ducted a puzzled expression came into
her pinched face

   we thought you were mrs carring-
ton explained  but all that can wait you
must lie still and be quiet you almost
died

   died mary ann quavered  what
makes me so weak when was all this

   four days ago now do be quiet and
sleep mrs carrington seated herself on
the side of the bed

  mary ann remained silent for a short
time then she opened her eyes again and
asked  what is this about my being ab-
ducted i must know she persisted  i
cannot rest until you tell me

  thetis decided that it would be less ex-
citing to tell the girl than to allow her to
fret over the matter besides the old
woman placed little faith in the abduction
story she thought it was largely a figment
of her husbandsrather romantic brain

   its like this mrs carrington began
 the morning we arrived we found the inn
in confusion mr bailey just before day
had heard a noise in your room and investi-
texas fever



gated you had disappeared and your win-
dow had been forced open and a ladder
was placed against the wall no one could
imagine what had become of you there
was confusion in the room where you had
slept although nothing was stolen-your
watch was on a chair beside your bed the
door leading into the hall was ajar it all
seemed so mysterious and of course dear
old charles was certain that you had been
carried off it was too silly she patted
the girl who stared fixedly at the wall
thetis did not tell her that shots had been
exchanged and that mr bailey believed he
had mortally wounded the man he had
found in mary anns room and who had
succeeded in escaping in spite of his wounds

   now everything is all right mrs
carrington went on  so go to sleep

  mary ann heaved a deep sigh and closed
her eyes but in a moment she opened them
once more

   it doesnt matter she murmured
 nothing matters if he is safe are you
sure fred is all right

   yes perfectly certain the older wom-
an assured her

  but mary ann was not yet satisfied
 promise me that he is still alive and be-
ing taken care of-promise me

   i do give you my solemn word thetis
leaned over and kissed the flushed face
 now go to sleep

  mary ann sank into a troubled stupor
and remained apparently unconscious until
late that afternoon thetis remained with
her most of the time and when the young
woman again came to herself she found
mrs carrington beside her

   i feel better the girl announced

   i am so glad my child

   i want to talk with you a little mary
ann pleaded

  her nurse made no spoken response but
leaned close over her

   it has all been so terrible mary ann
began  i thought you were captured by
the indians and-and-was it all a dream
 it certainly was not mrs carrington
explained  we were captives but for
some iffidiscoverable reason we were given
our liberty and as we started home we
came upon your husband and all the rescue-

    	argosy

party fred and steve rogers and two
other men who were both killed by the in-
dians left us to go to the scene of our bat-
tle with the savages and-

  mary ann interrupted  but steve rog-
ers was down-stairs i saw him when i
first came into that room the other-

   yes i know thetis interposed  he
had been with fred and he thought that
your husband was killed he just escaped
with his own life after a terrible race for it
he got in late the night before you stag-
gered in after steve had slipped through
the indians fingers he got lost and had an
awful time he and the others were to
leave the first thing that morning to search
for fred but you brave little girl came
in with your husband

  she ceased speaking because she saw by
her quiet breathing that the sufferer was
asleep

  mary ann was very ill but after three
more day she was well again only very
weak and pale frederick pope was not so
fortunate he hung between life and death
for many days although after mary ann
came to nurse him which she did on the
sixth day he began to improve

  she watched over him carefully scarcely
leaving his side except to eat and when
she slept it was on a pallet made of two
buffalo robes spread close beside his bed

  when the minister dr crabb who was
also a physician heard the tale of freds
rescue he declared that it was only the way
in which mary ann had cared for his
wounds and drawn the poison from them
that had saved the mans life

  long since the party had returned from
their vain attempts to locate the comanches
they easily found where they had been
camped beside the stream but the savages
had departed leaving no trail leonidas
carrington had been forced to return
empty-handed with them and no one could
understand what made him so different he
seemed disconsolate was exceedingly rest-
less and eagerly seconded his fathers im-
patient proposals that they again set out for
their new home in the red lands

  for the carringtons were actually con-
templating going out on that same journey
which had already cost them so dear it

          -

seemed almost unbelievable but such is
the dauntless spirit of pioneers and the
texas fever still raged in the carrington
blood they had no intention of leaving
the country even thetis would have scoffed
at such an idea but it was never once pro-
posed by any of them

  they collected fresh supplies and house-
hold goods buying them from other settlers
or travelers who stopped at the inn on their
way to various parts of the province

   you will come out too as soon as you
are well enough to travel thetis asked of
fred pope on the morning of their depar-
ture

   of course we will mary ann respond-
ed for him in her also the texas fever
was still running its course

  in great spirits the carringtons departed
accompanied by the two rogers boys they
went as though there was not the slightest
danger in their journey nothing had been
heard of indian attacks and depredations
for some time the country seemed quiet
 but mr bailey threw out as a com-
forting bit of information to his departing
guests  the comanches and apaches dont
leave no opportunity for robbing or murder
to pass em by in their sleep they are
ever ready for villainy

  her patient required mary anns almost
constant attention the doctor declared
him out of danger but he did not seem to
regain his strength his wounds were slow
to heal and were easily infected

  mary ann declared that she was going to
take over the case herself she believed
that the physician was too devout an advo-
cate of the lancet he insisted upon bleed-
ing fred every other day mary ann
thought that this was too often and told
the doctor so they had quite a scene and
when the young woman persisted in her de-
termination not to allow freds veins to be
opened again dr crabb threw up the case
and departed in a rage

  however he came again the following
daj and seemed surprised to find that fred
was still alive he continued his daily
visits and fred began steadily to improve
often now mary ann could leave him and
get a little much-needed recreation in the
fresh air

  slowly she was coming to know her hus-
band better to understand him and to ap-
preciate him the bigness and frankness
and fearlessness of his nature were an end-
less surprise to her yet in his quiet way
he always attempted to keep her from think-
ing him different from others

  often he would talk to her of his early
life and she began to suspect that the way
in which he had been held under was re-
sponsible for his being such a strangely
unresponsive person she was beginning to
doubt thetiss theory that he was  loved
out

  one day she asked fred how many sweet-
hearts he had had and was not surprised
but very delighted to learn that she was his
first and only love

  she accused him of not loving her at
all and to this he replied just as he had
long ago that he was not a romantic sort of
person

    i love you of course he said simply
 but not in a wild way that sort of thing
is not in me thats all i wish for your
sake that it was

   she was not to be appeased so easily and
remarked  but when im out of your
sight i always think that im out of your
mind you remember how you forgot me
when we went on that buffalo-hunt that
first day we were married and then again
when you went hurrying off after neils
murderer without taking the time to say
 good-by 

   yes he responded  i remember
and he added sadly  and i wonder what
ever became of jude-oh i would like to
have made the yellow devil pay for that
innocent boys death-

   there you go again  she broke in
 i ask you how you could have forgotten
me like that and you begin at once to
think about somebody else

   he took her small hands in one of his big
ones

    dear little girl he said  its like this
im afraid love to me is not all of life
even entirely without it i think i could
get on fairly well to lots of people it
means everything in the world-it is the
ultimate end for everything they do but
with me it is just a part a very beautiful
texas fever



sweet part but not everything i love
you and all that but i think i could live
without you and when other big things
come  do not ccase to love i just-well
 just go on to them

   and leave me to shift for myself she
added with a trifle of scorn and bitterness
in her voice

   no not exactly that he corrected
kissing her pouting lips  but those other
things need me the most if you had been
in any danger  would have remained with
you

  she thought this would be a good time to
tell him of de cardac and so she did
she confided to him the entire story she
told how she had once loved de cardac
and how that day when he had passed the
caravan she had been frightened into asking
fred to marry and protect her she went
on and told him that she had been divided
in mind when she saw paul again she had
scarcely known whether she still loved him
or not

  yes fred propped himself on his el-
bow and looked fixedly at his wife  yes i
think i understand he is the impetuous
lover and im rather a snail but dearest
i have a strong feeling- that my love will
last and that other-well that other is a
sort of a fire of straw

  he sank back on his pillows and to her
complete astonishment in a few minutes
was asleep she bit her lip would it
always be like this she wondered this
sudden way in which this man could go
from the most intimate conversation with
her to something far removed-this time
to sleep

  she resented the fact that he had showed
not the slightest jealousy when she spoke
of paul he took everything in such a
matter-of-course sort of way she was both
irritated and hurt

  she sat beside him for a long time think-
ing and then she decided that after all
she could not hope to make of fred pope
something which he was not he was that
should be enough for her he loved her
in his own way and she should be satisfied
with her state

  but there was a great longing within her
which was growing day by day for un-

suspected by herself she was falling very
much in love with this patient self-con-
tained and intensely masculine invalid

  she had seen nothing more of de cardac
since that one night when she had intro-
duced him to her husband and although
she had once or twice made timid inquiries
she had received no information no one
seemed to know anything about the hand-
some young creole

  and for the very simple reason that
paul was no longer in nacogdoches he
had left long since after that one desperate
attempt he had made to carry her off for
it was he who with the aid of the unknown
mulatto had forced her window-shutter and
climbed into her room only to discover that
she had disappeared and as they departed
the mulatto had received what proved to be
nearly his death-wound

  paul de cardac was not a bad man but
he was weak and now he was blindly wild-
ly in love and his imperious nature was one
that cotfld not brook denial he had en-
countered the mulatto again and in a burst
of desire had carefully planned the abduc-
tion

  it was upon the failure of this attempt
that he had learned that the mulatto with
whom he was plotting was the murderer
jude for whom the country was still vainly
seeking the young man was horror-strick-
en by the contemplation of the sort of com-
pany he was keeping and although he did
not attempt to hand jude over to the au-
thorities he did sever his connectionsith
the fellow this was very easy because
jude had mysteriously disappeared as he
leaped howling with pain from the ladder
beneath mary anns window paul knew
no more about him he presumed that the
mulatto was in hiding nursing his wounds
de cardac made a few cautious inquiries
but other than to discover judes identity
learned nothing and then he shortly after
departed for mississippi

  arriving in natchez he went at once to
mr sims to see what could be done to get
mary ann away from her present environ-
ment mr sims quietly informed him that
nothing could be done mary ann was of
age and besides she was married

   and mr sims commented  to the


argosy and railroad mans magazine

sort of man who seems to be quite capable
of holding on to that which belongs to
him

chapter xx

a ghastly find

in due course fred grew strong enough

  he fancied to permit of the departure of
himself and mary ann for their new home
in the red lands they took with them a
negress named polly with infinite diffi-
culty they had secured the services of this
woman not that polly did not wish to work
for them but servants were hard to find in
texas

  this one mary ann declared she had
positively stolen from mr bailey in whose
employ the negress had been for three
years

  the carringtons had promised to let
them have two of their men until they got
things running indeed thetis had planned
to have the house all in readiness to receive
them but mary ann and fred were ar-
riving more than a month ahead of time
they journeyed across the prairies without
any adventures or mishaps the carring-
tons had made various trips back and forth
to nacogdoches and had marked out a
shorter and easier way than they had pur-
sued on their first fatal journey fred and
mary ann had a little drawing of this new
route and availed themselves of it with
the result that they arrived at their log
house on the third day after leaving nacog-
doches and they had traveled slowly too

  fred had stood the trip very well and
they were both in great spirits at the pros-
pect of eating before their own hearth-
stone early the next morning the rogers
boys rode over to see them they had ob-
served the smoke from freds chimney and
suspecting his premature arrival came to
wish him welcome

  since fannies death the brothers were
living together in a little cabin which they
had built for themselves on the edge of a
small pool their land lay between the
property of the carringtons and that of
the popes

steve said that he knew the entire car-

rington tribe would come over to visit them
that evening

   how far away are they mary ann
inquired

   a little more than five miles but our
house is on the way and that is less than
two fred you must get strong soon and
come and help us steve continued we
are building a blockhouse for our common
protection against the indians

   what about the indians mary ann
asked apprehensively

   oh they are quiet-have been ever
since we arrived they come around some-
times begging but they are friendly ed
declared

   never trust a friendly indian steve
began  ed is too trusting i think-
mary ann broke in by asking  where
is the blockhouse being built

   just half-way between your place and
the carringtons in other words two and a
half miles from all of you folks but only
about three-quarters of a mile from us
and steve laughed  we dont have to ride
to our work

  after a certain time had been spent in
conversation of a more or less trivial na-
ture the rogers boys returned to their
work on the little fort and fred and mary
ann began their unpacking their house
consisted of one big room with a dirt floor
and above this were two small rooms
reached by a ladder

   its terribly crude fred commented
 but well soon build a shed close by for a
kitchen first though well have some
stairs made and put in the place of that
ladder

   and who will do all this mary ann
demanded sharply  you certainly are not
strong enough i tell you we should not
have come out here so soon 

  fred thought so himself but he made no
remarks to that effect

  that evening the carringtons and the
misses lord came to call and they all
passed a very pleasant time even melissa
was less catty than usual perhaps because
every one left her alone to flirt to her
hearts content with steve rogers

  hamilton announced that he and three
negro men would come over early the next
texas fever



morning and do the necessary carpentry
work about the place

   i wish leonidas were here he con-
tinued  hes the best man with his
hands

   where is he fred inquired

   gone to hunt his indian sweetheart
one of the twins announced with glee

   whats that mary ann exclaimed in
surprise

  then thetis told her the tale how leon-
idas had moped about and no one could
discover what ailed him and that finally
she had got at the truth he was des-
perately in love with one of the squaws of
the cemanches-hailstones was her name

   one of those terrible savages that fell
upon our cavern thetis explained  how
he could ever have done it i cant see he
wanted to go and seek out the girl and he
went how he ever expects to find her or
how he will ever get her are things quite
beyond me every day i imagine him
killed in some new way its awful to con-
ceive the thought

   besides it will be worse when he gets
the girl and comes home with her one
doesnt care to receive into ones heart the
leader of a band of indians who murdered
ones son and daughter not to mention the
servants and-and-

  thetis paused for breath and mary ann
asked

   couldnt you do anything to stop him
couldnt you talk to him

   talk to him the misses lord cried
in chorus  talk-she talked herself blue
in the face and she pleaded and she wept
and she got sick and threatened to die
what was there that she didnt do
they raised their hands appealingly to the
ceiling

   when did all this happen fred
wanted to know

   about ten days ago colonel carring-
ton announced and there was a certain
amount of pride in his voice as he added
 you know i think the boy did just right
but all the same i hope he doesnt ever
find her

   then hell never return to us his
mother wailed  but come we must go
these poor children must go to bed she

did not explain whether she meant the
twins or fred and mary ann

  however the party broke up and soon
the little two-story log cabin was dark and
quiet and the young couple asleep

  now began a quiet tranquil almost
idyllic period in the lives of mary ann and
fred pope they had a great deal of work
to do and they did it at night they were
often so weary that they went to bed with
the sun up again with the first streak of
day they began their tasks

  they were happy in their strenuous life
and happy with one another weeks
passed fred grew strong and mary ann
felt herself becoming a typical pioneers
wife she spent all the time that she could
spare from her duties on the prairies in
the midst of which their house was lo-
cated usually she went on foot and would
wander only a short distance from the house
and lie down in the tall grass and closing
her eyes turn her face up to the sun

  then came the winter and although
there were many days when they were
forced to keep close there were many other
times when warmly clad she could sit or
lie in the shelter of the tall gray-and-brown
grass

  there was an old ruined mission about
ten miles distant that she always rode to
when time afforded although polly at-
tempted to keep her from going to these
ruins declaring the local superstition that
they were haunted by the ghost of some one
who been murdered and dropped into the
old well

  fred objected to her riding about on the
prairie for he feared that once on horse-
back she would venture too far and either
get lost or encounter some danger the
indians had so far given them no trouble
often they saw them on the verge of the
prairies hunting or catching ponies great
galloping herds of these mustangs were an
almost daily sight

  mary ann had grown accustomed to re-
ceiving visits from friendly savages who
were cold and hungry and came for food or
anything they could get

  often they brought something with them
which they offered in exchange but these
things were usually worthless


argosy and railroad maxs magazine

  one day she had been amused when an
indian youth of perhaps sixteen years had
brought her a half-frozen live rabbit with
a wounded foot she did not want the
creature but realized that since she must
give the trader something she might as well
take the animal she did so and cooped
up the creature in the big room down-stairs
that night it disappeared

  imagine her surprise when the next day
the same indian returned with the same
rabbit and unblushingly offered it to her
again she at first thought that the boy
had found it and was returning her prop-
erty but she was soon undeceived

  he had stolen it polly swore that she
had seen him sneak it away late in the
afternoon when mary ann had been off on
one of her frequent visits to the carring-
tons

  mary ann refused to repurchase the rab-
bit but as the indian looked cold she
poured out a glass of home-made wine and
offered it to him he refused and know-
ing the savages weakness for liquor in any
form she was surprised she attempted
by signs to induce the boy to drink it but
he shrank from her and crouched in a cor-
ner glaring at her and at the tiny glass
with its dark-red contents

   well you are a funny boy she mur-
mured although she knew that the indian
could not understand a word

  she raised the glass to her own lips not
wishing to see the wine wasted instantly
the youth sprang upon her and snatching
the glass from her fingers he drained it and
then with a grunt dashed for the door
taking his rabbit with him

  mary ann at once grasped the signifi-
cance of the episode the youth had be-
lieved that the wine was poisoned and it
had not been until she tasted it that he was
reassured

  suddenly it broke over her why the in-
dians so hated the whites and why they
attacked them for no apparent reason ex-
cept just because they were whites it had
taken a great amount of deceitful dealing
and treachery on the part of the white man
to make such simple creatures as this boy
believe that a glass of wine hospitably of-
fered to him was poison

  on another occasion she had been over
at the home of the rogers boys where she
and polly had gone to aid in the making
of some soap this was considerably later
-in the spring while the big pot of soap
was boiling an old indian and his son a
youth of perhaps twenty had silently
watched the proceedings finally after
some few words grunted among themselves
the boy who was a magnificent specimen
of youthful strength and grace came for-
ward and made it evident that they wanted
some of the stuff that was cooking in the
pot they wished to eat it

  mary ann attempted to convey the in-
formation that the boiling substance was
not intended for food the indian how-
ever seemed to think that she was trying
to tell him that it was not to be eaten while
it was hot

  she was inclined to laugh at the whole
thing but the young fellow was insistent
and made every effort to inform her that
the much-desired delicacy was not for
himself but for the old man his father

  she attempted to divert him by offering
other things-things that were really good
to eat but the youth would have nothing
he grew more vehement in his demands
he was now thoroughly convinced that the
whites would not part with the soap be-
cause it was so wonderfully desirable

  finally steve rogers who had just come
out of the house learning of the commo-
tion cried

   let the fools have some it will do
them good to learn that they should listen
to us whites when we say no

   but im afraid that when the old man
tastes it he will be very angry and that
may make trouble mary ann demurred

   let me catch them making any trouble
around here steve announced pugna-
ciously

  he went over and dipped out some of
the boiling soap and filling a bowl with it
was about to hand it to the indian but
the boy was quicker than he and snatched
the bowl from steve and ran with it to the
old man

  then began a period of blowing and
grunting among the indians meanwhile
the whites looked on with interest final-
texas fever



ly the soap was sufficiently cooled and the
old man raised the bowl to his lips and took
a great gulp

  he choked attempted frantically to ex-
pel the soap from his mouth but some of
it had slipped down his throat he gagged
and the stalwart youth looked on anxiously
ready to render any assistance that might
be necessary

  he was quivering with fear and excite-
ment the old man was a pitiable object
for a few moments but steve rogers did
not restrain his laughter and although
mary ann succeeded in keeping her face
straight polly guffawed loudly

  the old indian clung to the bowl
throughout all his troubles but when he was
quiet he raised it above his head and then
viciously dashed it to the ground where
it smashed into little bits the old fellow
turned and darted a venomous look at the
laughing white man then stalked proudly
away and in his trail glided the youth

  mary ann did not learn until some time
afterward that the old man had died the
next day of some intestinal trouble that
had been troubling him for some time and
the youth believing that his father had
been poisoned by the witch-broth of the
whites swore vengeance upon steve

  after making the soap mary ann went
home and took polly with her but they
forgot and left one of their pots at steves
house they intended to return and get it
the next day but were prevented by some
trivial hindrance and it was not until the
second day after that mary ann accompa-
nied by the black woman rode over to get
the missing pot

  meanwhile steve rogers forgot all about
the old indian and the soap incident on
the same day indeed at about the same
time that mary ann started toward his
house steve decided to take a swim in the
big pool that was directly behind his cabin
he wanted to make ed come with him
but ed was busy dressing himself to go to
see the carringtons

  he seemed to be attempting very hard to
cut out his brother in the affections of me-
lissa the matter was quite a joke with
the little community and melissa seemed
to enjoy the rivalry that she had aroused

although part of the fun was spoiled be-
cause everybody knew that she was engaged
to steve and that soon they were to be
married

   better come on in for a swim steve
called as he left the little log house which
consisted of a single big room

   no ed laughed back  im going to
see our girl

  steve departed alone taking his gun with
him and ed continued with his toilet at
the end of about twenty minutes ed heard
his brother calling for help and a moment
afterward the air was rent by the whoop
of a savage

  ed snatched up his gun and dashed in
the direction of the pool which was less
than a hundred yards away as he ran
he saw three redskins scampering up the
bank on the far side of the pool although
they were were too far away he fired at
them as they disappeared in the woods that
hugged the far bank

  as he ran ed called frantically to his
brother but there came no response when
he reached the pool there lay steve naked
and bloody

  ed rushed up to him and a most awful
sight met his eyes steve had not only been
murdered but he had been scalped three
knives had been plunged into his heart he
was dead but his limbs still jerked and
twitched the miserable man had evident-
ly been scalped while he still lived

  ed rogers went blind with fury and
forgetting everything dashed for his horse
he left his brothers body by the side of
the pool sprang into his saddle and started
in pursuit of the murderers

  within ten minutes after he had left
mary ann and polly arrived and were
surprised to find both the brothers away
and the house open she decided that both
men were bathing in the pool and she left
polly to fetch the pot from inside the house
while she mischievously crept down to sur-
prise the brothers at their bath

  she came upon the murdered body and
screamed polly came running and be-
tween them they got the corpse up to the
house

  they could not imagine what had hap-
pened and both were fearful lest this be

the prelude to a massacre of the little set-
tlement mary ann was wild to go and
warn fred and the carringtons of the
threatening danger

  but when with their ghastly burden
they had almost reached the house an
arrow whizzed by her she urged polly to
haste in a few moments they were safe
inside the cabin and rushed to bar the door
and windows

  peeping through the cracks they saw an
indian glide up close to the house it was
the son of the man who had eaten the soap
even then marv ann did not connect the
murder of steve with the discomfiture of
the old savage

  rut she did wish that she had brought
either her pistol or rifle with her it was
almost an unheard-of thing for her to ven-
ture forth without one or the other but
steves house had seemedso near and there
had been absolutely no trouble of any kind
since she and fred arrived in the red
lands and she had become careless

  in fear and trembling she and polly
searched the house but found no weapon
the indian seemed to have disappeared
but they did not know at what minute he
might return and lead an attack upon the
hut

  they busied themselves in washing and
dressing the poor mutilated body then
they seated themselves and waited the
night came on and not daring to make a
light lest it attract the shots of the indians
they sat in darkness with the corpse of the
murdered man between them

  the night wore on from time to time
they thought they heard footsteps creeping
about the house but they could not be sure
they spoke sometimes but always in sub-
dued whispers and suffered agonies of sus-
pense mary ann did not know but that
even now her own home was in ruins and
fred and their friends slaughtered she
wondered where ed rogers was and
feared that perhaps he might be dead be-
side the pool and had been overlooked by
them when they hastened toward the house
with steves body

  in this gruesome silence then they sat
all night long and when daylight came
mary ann determined that she would risk

everything and attempt to get to fred and
if it were not already too late warn him
and have him warn the carringtons of the
actions of the indians

conspirators

daul de cardac was not inclined
to agree with mr sims that nothing
could now be done about mary ann the
more he thought about her the more he
determined that married or not he must
get possession of her

  paul de cardacs nature now underwent
a strange transformation-a transformation
so great and so violent that he seemed sud-
denly to become another man from his
old courteous charming gentlemanly self
he was changed into an unscrupulous
scheming ruffian

  he had wanted something very much
and in times past he had moved heaven
and earth to gain this desire now he would
move hell itself nay more he would be-
come hells chief mover in the diabolic plans
which dashed with lightning rapidity
through his brain

  he returned to nacogdoches and pre-
sented himself at the little inn

  mr bailey was sitting in the sun at the
entrance of the  run indulging in his
usual pastime of whittling

   what are you nosing round here for
the innkeeper gruffly demanded

  paul resented the tone the question and
the manner in which it was put but in a
moment realized that it was all probably
due to the innkeepers bad manners he
answered that he was looking for mrs
pope

   well you wont find her here and mr
bailey returned to his whittling

  paul asked apprehensively where she
was

  mr bailey rose and started to walk
away

   theyve left he announced

   gone paul cried

   with her husband came the laconic
addition

 where paul was shorter in his
texas fever



speech but much more quiet than the inn-
keeper

   its none of your business mr bailey
responded and as de cardac took an an-
gry step toward him he added  keep
cool young man dont get excited you
might make yourself sick

  paul was close beside him and glaring
angrily at him as if about to strike the
old man but mr bailey quickly spoke
and his words were of such a character as
completely to divert pauls intention

   from the looks of you young fellow
he began i should say you was in for
a bad spell o fever youre yaller as er
gourd then pointedly he added as
yaller as the company you keeps

  de cardac started before he could
speak the inkeeper went on

   i will just tell you this-i know some-
thin of your companions- i have seen you
more than once with a mulatto that i think
is neil carringtons murderer im not
sure and i aint never been able to catch
you but ive got my eyes out for that
jude and ill just keep my peepers on you
too

  paul de cardac flushed he dared not
retort he did not know just how much
the old man knew and he thought it best
to let the matter drop he was therefore
about to walk away when changing his
mind he advanced and looking the inn-
keeper squarely in jhe eyes demanded

   have the popes left nacogdoches

   well mr bailey began  if i said
as how they had what would it matter to
you

   i must know paul cried

   very well then they have gone yis-
tiddy

   where did they go

   im not tellin unless  know why
youre askin

   i must see mrs pope paul an-
nounced

   well youll not find her from anything
ill tell you the innkeeper growled  ill
not have you pesterin that young woman
i like her and thats more than i will
say for her husband hes too dog-goned
opinionated like

   you mean that you will not tell me

where they have gone de cardac de-
manded

   thats about it mr bailey coolly
responded

  ill find out paul announced vio-
lently

   well not from me and i dont think
nobody else knows mr bailey snapped

  paul turned on his heel and walked back
to his own home his head was throbbing
so that he could scarcely think but he was
wishing intensely that he knew where he
could find jude but since the negro
probably desperately wounded had disap-
peared he had been able to find no trace of
him

  feverishly he mumbled to himself

   jude would go with me i must go
i must go and get her i must

  restless uncertain and full of longing
he wandered about his little two-room
cabin forming a hundred wild impossible
schemes and almost immediately abandon-
ing them all

  it was late afternoon and time to eat
but instead of making any preparations for
his evening meal he left the house he
went out to make inquiries as to where the
popes had gone

  no one seemed to know anything about
them but at last he found a negro girl who
told him that a covered wagon containing a
man and a woman had driven by at noon
the previous day they had taken the old
san antonio road and she believed they
were bound for baxter

  without a thought of food or anything
else paul hurriedly saddled his horse and
took the old spanish trail this road
usually much frequented proved very lone-
ly at night for he rode all through the
hours of darkness without passing any one

  urged on by his impatient desires he
continued his journey without eating until
late afternoon then he was forced from

                                        

sheer exhaustion to dismount lest he pitch
from his horse

  he was hot with fever faint from lack
of nourishment and miserable from dis-
appointment he had worked himself into
such a state that had he encountered fred
without a moments hesitation he would
have fired upon him


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  paul de cardac lay upon the ground near
his horse wondering why the sun should
be jumping about so his tongue was
parched and although he had drunk more
than half of his flask of whisky and all
of the staled water contained in the skin
which he had found tied to his saddle his
thirst remained unabated

  he attempted to get up but sank back
aching in every joint

   i think im going to be sick he mut-
tered and wondered what he should do

  then his head began to spin as though it
were entirely separate from his body it
seemed as if it were whirling in a giddy
manner about his feet he groaned and
seeking for his whisky-flask put it to his
lips and was about to drink

  a movement of his horse caused him to
turn his head in his half-delirious condi-
tion the horse appeared to be a fabulous
creature with wings and a hot fiery breath
this monster drew nearer and nearer to
him and he felt as though it was already
devouring him the flask fell from his
burning hands and with a cry he sank back
unconscious

  he lay in this condition moaning and
talking by turns all that night and early
the next morning was discovered by a party
of comanche indians who were returning
from a successful attack upon the covered
wagon which had been bound for baxter
the savages advanced in a wild humor
they were overjoyed with their recent plun-
der and the addition of two scalps now
worn at the belt of their old chief broken-
big-toe rendered them ferociously proud

  at the head of the comanches rode hail-
stones and she was about to allow her
braves to despatch this new victim when
jude dashed forward and interceded he
had recognized de cardac and whereas he
bore the creole no good-will he realized that
paul might be of infinite service to him in
his future attempts upon frederick pope

  after some altercation jude was permit-
ted to put de cardacs limp body across
the saddle of the sick mans own horse
and to proceed with the unconscious suf-
ferer to the place where the comanches
were temporarily camped

  now began a long period of desperate

illness for paul de cardac who hung be-
tween life and death for many days always
watched over and cared for by the mu-
latto several times the restless coman-
ches moved their camp but jude remained
in a small shelter which he had built and
where paul lay tossing about in agony

  sometimes jude would surprise himself
with the tenderness and care which he be-
stowed upon the fever-stricken patient
time passed the disease reached its crisis
jude was ceaseless in his attention the
crisis passed paul still lived

  they depended largely upon the coman-
ches of whose band jude was considered a
member to keep them supplied with neces-
sities the provisions given them were of
course the worst things possible for the
sick man but he had an iron constitution
and slowly in spite of everything began to
mend	v

  weeks had gone by they had found a
more protecting shelter and there winter
came upon them de cardac continued
slowly to improve but he was still far from
well

  the comanches were off on one of their
frequent raids and had not been near them
for ten days jude sat talking with de
cardac who although too weak to do much
for himself was beginning to plan

   well have to be doing something
mighty soon the mulatto declared

  you mean food supply is low

   yes jude responded

  the sick man made a wry face

   you might kill me paul began
 though i suppose id make bad eating

  at first jude made no reply to this pleas-
antly then he said

   when you git strong you will go with
me for him

  this was the first time that their com-
mon enemy had ever been spoken of and
in reply the white man extended his thin
shaky hand

  instantly it was grasped by the mulatto
the two understood each other

  jude spoke first

   you want her he slowly announced

   and his life paul added

   his life the mulatto echoed ques-
tioningly


texas fever



   yes i hate him paul cried fiercely

  jude was astonished but he was also
delighted now these two could work in
perfect harmony it was rather remark-
able how they supplemented each other
paul gave to the ex-slave just that initiative
that backbone which his years of servility
had robbed him of and the mulatto by his
recklessness and cold-bloodedness which
was largely born of ignorance confirmed
paul in the cruelty and vindictiveness
which were such recent additions to his
nature

  one night in the early spring-time they
had a call from hailstones she was alone
and brought them some food she was
never a talkative person and now she
seemed more than usually taciturn they
could not learn just what had brought her
to them nor why she had chosen the night
for her visit hut they did learn to their
surprise that she had temporarily separated
herself from the band and had not been
with the comanches for several days al-
though she knew where they were lying in
wait

   in the course of her talk she told the two
men that she had seen the  white squaw
and her man she had heard about fred-
erick and mary ann from jude in the early
days when desperately wounded the mu-
latto had returned to the indians and
thrown in his lot with them

  de cardac started up

   where are they he cried

  she told him that they were three days
journey away and that they lived in a
cabin of their own not far from the ruins
of the little mission where she had received
her education

   when can we go paul asked excited-
ly he raised himself on his elbow and
looked about with bright eyes

   theres no chance of our going until
youre well jude said  and goodness
knows when that will be

  paul turned suddenly to the indian girl
 how did you come to be prowling about
where they live

  hailstones made no immediate reply
she seemed lost in her own thoughts how
could she tell these men her inmost secrets
how could she ever explain to them that

since leonidas carrington had gone away
from her she had been miserable and lone-
some

  she had tried to forget him then she
had hoped and prayed that he would dis-
regard all she had told him and come and
take her for his own even to herself she
saw something pathetic in the way in which
she had gone wandering over the prairies
seeking to find again her lost peace of mind
she had gone again to the scenes where
she had been taught what she first knew of
the whites she knew that the little mis-
sion was only a ruin but still she had gone
and wandered about the old familiar
haunts

  by accident she had seen mary ann and
had followed her hoping against hope that
she would catch sight of the man she loved
but she had not for the simple reason that
leonidas was out elsewhere seeking high
and low for her

  finally hailstones spoke

   sometimes she began  i go where
white man lives i am looking-always
looking for some one and she added
sadly as if speaking to herself but i
never find some one

  de cardac was puzzled and felt inclined
to question her and learn further about
this some one for whom she was seeking
but his own affairs were of too much im-
portance

   will you take us where the white man
and his squaw are living he asked

   too sick-you she objected

   no he cried  i think im well
enough i know i am its nice weather
now spring is here yes i can go

  he was full of fire and extraordinarily
fresh and animated in appearance

  jude attempted to argue with him he
only succeeded in persuading de cardac
ter remain where he was provided that jude
himself went at once with the indian and
learned just how the land lay

   i will go jude agreed  and come
back as quickly as i can you keep care
of yourself and maybe when i come you
can go away with me and then-

  he raised his eyes in an expressive way
and did not finish his sentence

  early the next day jude departed with


argosy and railroad mans magazine

hailstones leaving the invalid with enough
food to last him about a week

  five days de cardac was left alone and
strange to relate he fared much better dur-
ing this time than in his wildest hopes he
had anticipated perhaps he had depend-
ed too long upon the careful ministrations
of the mulatto and it only required the
necessity of an effort on his part to pull him
into shape or it may have been the stim-
ulation of the prospect of at last accom-
plishing his long-deferred desire

  when jude returned he was astonished to
find the young man not only as he ex-
pressed it  up and doing but in a fit
condition to travel and looking remarkably
like his old handsome self hailstones was
not with the mulatto but had gone back
she said to join her band

   theres something funny about that
indian jude declared  shes sort of
lost like

   lost paul queried

   yes-lonesome like jude explained

   im sure  dont care de cardac re-
marked

  jude looked at his companion in surprise
sometimes he found it hard to believe that
this hard cruel selfish man was the kind
love-sick gentleman he had first known
paul had changed so much that even jude
was a little afraid of him

  without any regrets they broke camp
and departed and the heart of each man
thrilled at last they were moving upon
their prey

  this time they were determined to pro-
ceed with such caution and thought as to
insure the success which heretofore had al-
ways eluded them it was judes sugges-
tion that they take up their abode in the
ruins of the old mission

   theres a little shelter there the mu-
latto explained  and we wont be far from
the house doc has two niggers at work
with him and besides his wife has a niggej
woman we cant fight em all i dunno
what well do but when we are near some-
thin is sho to turn up

  the night of their arrival under cover
of the darkness jude went to freds home
on a stealthy tour of investigation he re-
turned with the disconcerting news that the

house was absolutely deserted neither
whites nor blacks were about

  where had they gone what had oc-
curred what should they do now such
thoughts thronged the heads of the con-
spirators

  it just happened that it was this same
night that mary ann spent beside the body
of steve rogers indeed just after dawn
the next morning de cardac and his part-
ner were almost caught by fred and his
party who were scouring the country for
the indians who had compassed steves
murder

  de cardac was awakened by jude whis-
pering fiercely

   quick get up doc pope and a big
crowd are on us

   wtiere

   there the mulatto pointed de bush-
es and dat strip of wall hide em they are
headed dis way

  immediately de cardac was alert he
snatched at his gun and was about to spring
to his feet	

jude caught at him with a frantic clutch
 keep down the mulatto cried
 they might see you we must hide
take everything with you dont leave
any traces

   wtiere shall we hide

   in dat old well we found yistiddy
theyll never hunt us dere jude began
with assurance but ended weakly  any-
how its de only place

   but our horses de cardac cried as
he was creeping after the mulatto

   they are hitched way over dere so
deep in de brush theyll never find em
anyway dey cant be huntin us

   who are they after paul wondered
aloud

  jude did not respond but stole noiseless-
ly forward almost bent double paul
followed close after they could not yet
see the approaching party of horsemen but
they could hear them talking

   hurrv jude whispered impatiently
they had reached the old well and
hastily but cautiously climbed over the side
and began the descent the walls were
formed of rough stones which had once
been held in place by plaster now the
texas fever



plastering had fallen out and they easily
climbed down and remained crouching in
almost a foot of mud which covered the
bottom

  so far they were safe but they were still
in grave danger they heard the men dis-
mount and go stamping about among the
ruins hurriedly searching for some one

  their voices frequently drifted down into
the depths of the well and once some one
came and looked down but as both of the
crouching figures were darkly clothed and
jude had heard the man approaching in
time to warn de cardac to hide his face
and hands the seeker turned away

   do you suppose they are after us
paul whispered

  for reply jude put his grimy hand
across the white mans mouth

  a long time elapsed in silence the hid-
den men could no longer hear voices and
imagined that the searching-party had
passed on but they dared not venture
forth for now they were in terror lest
their horses be discovered and thus the
suspicion of the seekers be aroused to such
an extent that they would probably hang
about the ruins all day

  finally jude considered it safe to go up
and look around he began the climb but
found it considerably more difficult than the
descent liut he finally accomplished it
and was gone some time de cardac was
alarmed and could not imagine what had
happened but at last judes face appeared
and the mulatto called down that all was
safe

  paul climbed out and saw that there was
no trace of the horsemen

   where have they gone he whispered
looking about over the expanse of prairie

   dey are concealed from us by that
thicket where the horses are hid jude
responded  i done looked dats what
took me so long

   now they are sure to get the horses
paul moaned  we better go back into the
well

   dey is long past where the hosses is
jude contemptuously explained

  so the horsemen had passed them by
their search had certainly not been very
thorough but perhaps they had been too

anxious to press on and had regarded the
old ruined mission as a most improbable
place to discover that for which they sought

   well we learned one good thing de
cardac announced  fred popes cabin is
without his protection lets go there at
once and see what we can find

   first jude began  dares something
mighty strange here lets see about it

  it seems that while in the well he had
noticed the cavity where a large stone of
the wall had long since fallen out and
he had heard the footsteps of the horsemen
very distinctly through this opening he de-
clared that he believed the side of the well
would prove to be the wall to a cellar

  they grubbed about in the ruins and
sure enough before long discovered a huge
trap-door hidden beneath almost half a foot
of debris

  the door was made of big heavy timbers
and in a fine state of preservation it was
held in place by a monstrous bolt which
had so corroded that try as they would the
two men could not budge it

   xo use jude declared  ten men
couldnt prize that open lefs go down
the well

  they did so and jude with little difficul-
ty succeeded in effecting an opening large
enough for them easily to slip through he
then lighted a torch that he had brought
down with him and crept through the hole
de cardac was about to follow him when
jude cried that it was no use

   nothing here the mulatto declared
 just a cellar and big steps up to that trap-
door

   well im going to see paul declared
dropping through the hole and dislodging
another large stone which fell with a thud
the distance of about four feet to the bottom
of the well

  they found themselves in an underground
room of about twenty feet by twelve at
one was an old stairs that led to the trap-
door which had probably once opened into
the kitchen or pantry of the mission the
room had an earthen floor which was not
very hard and the earth of the roof was
supported by heavy boards resting on rough
posts the place was chill but the air was
not very bad


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   i guess it used to be the store-room
the young creole announced  and it was
built close to the well for the sake of cool-
ness

   maybe jude admitted  lets go
again they climbed through the opening
and monkey-fashion ascended to the sun-
light once there de cardas was for going
at once to freds home

   but i tell you jude expostulated
 she aint there

   maybe she has returned de cardac
rejoined  she was not with those men
they went to where jude had hitched the
horses and mounting started toward the
little house where lived fred and mary
ann they advanced cautiously availing
themselves of the high grass and when
they had arrived within about a mile of the
place they left their horses and crept for-
ward on foot

  the two men seemed perfectly cool and
made trite remarks to each other but with-
in they were so full of excitement that they
could with difficulty control themselves

  when they drew near the house they
heard voices women were speaking with-
in one of these women was mary ann

chapter xxii

the abduction

n foot mary ann and polly prepared
to depart from the rogers house
they spread a sheet over the body of the
murdered man and crept away hating to
leave the door unlocked and yet having
no means of fastening it it was early in
the morning and the sun shone beneficiently
upon the prairies now beginning to show
faintly green for spring was well under
way

  they were unarmed and apprehensively
they traversed the mile and a half of open
country but nothing occurred to alarm
them and when they reached mary anns
home they were not surprised to find the
house deserted

  fred had gone and so had the two ne-
groes but this time young pope had thought
sufficiently of his wife to leave a note she
found this stuck in a crack between the

steps of the rude staircase hurriedly she
opened it and read

    steve rogers has been killed by the in-
  dians i am going with ed and the carring-
  tons in pursuit of the murderer the moment
  you get this go at once to the carringtons
  house and stay there until i come back and
  for gods sake be careful

               yours	f p

  so fred had departed again on some
one elses business if not absolutely for-
getting his wife at least making no effort
to assure himself that she was safe and
out of danger of course he had no way
of knowing where she was or under what
circumstances she was going to spend the
night but she felt that he should have
made an effort to find out she was an-
noyed and determined not to go to the car-
ringtons if for no other reason than to
irritate her husband

  she had scarcely made this resolve when
thetis melissa and the misses lord ar-
rived on the scene mary ann not know-
ing who her visitors were looked them over
through a loophole high up in the wall
the four women were armed almost to flie
teeth it did not seem humorous to see
guns swung around the shoulders of the
mother and daughter but the sight of the
misses lord each brandishing a large pistol
with which she menaced the life of herself
and all in the neighborhood was almost
too much for many ann

  she hastily unbarred the door and allowed
her visitors to enter

   steve rogers has been killed and
scalped the misses lord announced in
chorus their teeth chattering with fear

   and we have been terrified about you
thetis added  last night fred and ed
rogers came by our house and took with
them all of our men they are scouring
the country now for the indians

  melissa interrupted her mother to re-
mark  we were told you were coming to
us your husband said so

  mary ann looked at her and smiled
 well i didnt come she said

   so i see melissa retorted  you
dont mind your husband so well now that
you are getting used to him

 mary ann ignored this remark and
texas fever



turning to thetis told how she had found
steves body at the edge of the pool and
how she and polly had dragged it back to
the cabin at the door of which they had
been fired upon by an unseen indian she
quickly rehearsed the details of the terrible
night which she had passed polly who
had again barred the door after the entrance
of the visitors stood listening with wide
eyes as though hearing the story for the
first time once she interrupted tct tefl
about the indian boy that she had seen
prowling in the neighborhood of the rogers
house

   it wuz de same one what fotched de
soap fur his po pa to eat

   do you suppose melissa inquired
 that boy had anything to do with steves
death

   who knows mary ann cried and
added  but what difference does that
make are we all going to stay here

  good heavens no cried the misses
lord as usual speaking in chorus

   why not mary ann wanted to know
 we are as well protected here as any-
where and if the indians are out to take
the five-mile ride across country to your
house seems to me a foolish and needless
tempting of providence

  but thetis would not hear of remaining
she had promised the colonel that she would
abide in her own home and defend it against
all comers and so she intended to do

   i only came to see what was the matter
with you child we were frightened and
looked for you all last night she explained

  mary ann saw no reason for arguing and
collecting arms and ammunition she and
polly went out to saddle their horses in-
tending to accompany the carringtons

  they discovered their animals were gone
whether stolen or taken by freds party
they did not know they were therefore
obliged to return and beg to be permitted
to ride double with melissa and the lighter
of the misses lord their request was
granted and the cavalcade was soon under
way

  their progress had certain elements of
humor but no one was in the mood to ap-
preciate the fact they were nervous and
always on the lookout for skulking indians

tw-ice they were alarmed by noises in the
high grass but either these noises came
from frightened animals or if made by sav-
ages the savages did not attack them

  as they emerged from the house they did
not see two men crouching in the bushes
one man was white and the other mulatto
they were de cardac and jude they did
not deem it expedient to attack the party of
six armed women for as de cardac after-
ward remarked he was not so afraid of the
ones that knew how to use their guns as
he was of those two old women who kept
waving their pistols around

   theyd never hit anything they aimed
at but theyd be sure to kill one or the
other of us by accident he averred

  jude had wanted to fire upon the women
and it had only been with considerable diffi-
culty that de cardac held him back

   we must wait he whispered  this
is not the time

  as the women passed near the rogers
house they wanted to go in but the misses
lord were too terrified to do so and rather
than divide their forces they hurried on
to the carrington place

  here mary ann was surprised to find
one negro man  i thought all the men
had gone with fred she exclaimed

   all but this one melissa explained

   who did you suppose id leave the
twins with thetis flared indignantly
 did you think i would have left them
here entirely alone with only a few nigger
women

  mary ann did not reply to this anti-
feminist remark but began assisting her
friends in the many duties that were re-
quired to fit the house for what they be-
lieved might be an immediate indian at-
tack but the indians did not come four
days passed and there was no sign of an
attack but also no sign of the return of
fred and his posse

  the only difficulty that the little garrison
encountered was that of procuring water
this was always fetched from a branch
which formed a pool off at one side of the
house they took turns going out after
it two at a time one of the negresses
would bear the pails and one of the white
women would accompany her as a guard


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  late one afternoon polly caused a terrible
commotion by returning with the announce-
ment that she had seen the indian boy
of the soap episode peeping at her from be-
hind a big tree whose branches extended
out over the pool one of the misses lord
had been pollys guard and a the first yell
which polly had emitted the guard had
turned and incontinently fled back to the
house leaving the terrified negress to her
fate but polly got hold of herself and
made such strenuous efforts to reach safety
that-she actually arrived before miss lord

  although the indian had done nothing
whatever except peep at them no one in
the place slept that night and twice thetis
was sure that she heard footsteps they
were all in a bad state by morning and
were really in no condition to protect them-
selves had any danger presented itself but
no danger did present itself although they
felt it hovering near them

  they wondered what had become of the
men what was keeping them so long why
they had heard nothing from them no
more trips had been made to the branch for
water and before night their supply was
entirely exhausted finally polly whose
mercurial temperament had so completely
recovered from her fright that she seemed no
longer cognizant of the danger lurking about
the spring offered to go and fetch water
but only on condition that she had the
negro man as a guard

   i think its silly for anybody to go
mrs carrington declared but they had
had less than one pail of water for the whole
party for a day and a night and the twins
were clamorous for a drink

   we cant go through the night without
water mary ann commented  and i
dont see any use in waiting for the men
to come back they maynt return to-night
at all tthink polly had better go now

  it was about eight oclock and quite dark
when polly accompanied by the negro and
miss lord who carried a pine torch left
the house

   i think its very silly to let that old
woman go with them melissa remarked

   shes not so old snapped miss lord
who had been left behind  shes almost
my twin and im sure im not old

  melissa smiled and made no reply in-
deed she had no opportunity because at
that instant they were startled by blood-
curdling shrieks and in these shrieks they
could make out a mans voice as well as
the staccato yells of miss lord

   by heavens what can have hap-
pened cried mary ann looking to see that
the door was securely barred

   they are probably being scalped an-
nounced one of the twins in a comforting
way 

  at that moment an avalanche was hurled
against the door and in terror the women
were about to fire from their various loop-
holes when from out of the darkness came
the frantic cries of miss lord

   open the door let us in

  the door was unbarred and the negro
man whose terrified eyes seemed to stretch
over most ofhis face dashed into the room
at his heels came polly and miss lord
polly was minus her two buckets and miss
lord had lost her torch and her hair was
streaming out behind her

   it is a panther-a panther the poor
woman shrieked  at the- spring-in the
tree-polly was getting down on her knees
and i looked up and saw his big eyes

   a little mo and id a been snatched
to gawd amighty polly supplemented

  more than one person cried  a pan-
ther 

   yes miss lord began when mary
ann interrupted by announcing  im go-
ing to see

  an astonished silence greeted her remark
but before she could reach the door every
one was remonstrating

   are you sure it was a panther mary
ann demanded

   sho as im alive polly cried  i saw
him good i saw his eyes shinin up out of
de branch and i thought they was stars
till i heard miss lord fotch a yell and then
i looked up an saw him all yeller in the
tree

   i am going mary ann cried and be-
fore any one could stop her she unbarred
the door and rifle in hand started across
the threshold

  wait take a light go with her
somebody miss lord implored
texas fever



   whats she going for george perti-
nently demanded

   to satisfy her fool curiosity melissa
snapped  thats the only reason i can
see

   she shall not go alone thetis cried
as she also disappeared through the door
into the darkness

  this was the signal for a general exodus
from the house every one rushed forth
as if determined to capture mary ann the
negro man a pine torch in each hand soon
joined them

   wheres she gone mrs carrington
demanded she was about fifty yards from
the house on the way toward the branch
and there was no sign of mary ann

    shes right thar see her dress  polly
pointed and called out but no reply came
and no one was able to see anything in
the direction indicated by the negress

   i guess the panthers got her george
confided to georgiana

    do they eat little boys and little girls
too georgiana wanted to know

  georges reply was cut short by a note
of terror in his mothers voice

   something horrible has happened
mrs carrington declared  that girl has
disappeared theres her gun on the ground
-right there by you melissa

  melissa gingerly picked up the gun it
was mrs popes several voices called to
mary ann but there was still no response
if she had only gone to the branch she could
easily have heard them it was not more
than three hundred yards from the house

  in amazement the little crowd stood won-
dering what had happened

   thetis soon recovered sufficiently to take
charge of the situation she ordered them
all back into the house and taking the negro
man and polly with her started bravely
toward the branch in a few moments they
arrived near the water

  there was no sign of mary ann thetis
called again with no success it was as
though the earth had opened up and swal-
lowed the girl and then mrs carrington
thought she heard horses the sound was
so muffled that she could not be sure but
she called again and again xo answer

  in the excitement caused by this un-

    	argosy

looked for disaster the panther had been
forgotten until a scream from polly was
accompanied by her announcement that she
could see his eyes again thetis went for-
ward a few steps

  shading her face from the glare of the
torch she distinctly saw the outlines of some
beast crouching in the tree across the
branch she could shoot but she was not
an accurate marksman nevertheless she
leveled her rifle and fired and polly fol-
lowed her example whether it was pollys
shot or mrs carringtons that took effect
they did not know but a commotion oc-
curred in the branches and then the creature
moved so that it came more clearly into
view they had wounded it and it was
as the negress had declared a panther

   hes cornin down on us the negro
man cried in terror

   not until after he gets across the
branch mrs carrington disdainfully an-
nounced she had loaded again and was
ready to fire this time she took accurate
aim and the shot did the work the pan-
ther mortally wounded attempted to reach
the ground but half-way down fell and
crashed into the bushes at the far side of
the pool

    think hes done for thetis an-
nounced  but i wish i knew where that
girl has gone she called again and again
but finally gave up arrd started back to the
house hoping against hope that when she
arrived mary ann would be there

  she found the little garrison in a state of
panic not only had mary ann not re-
turned but mrs carringtons shots had
scared them almost to death in imagina-
tion they had seen her and her companions
murdered in a dozen different ways

  the misses lord had taken refuge in
their usual manner and it was not until the
customary administration of brandy that
their hysterical cries and laughter were
quieted general consternation possessed
the party because of mary anns mysterious
disappearance try as they would they
could find no explanation until one of the
twins commenting upon the fact suggested
that whoever it was that put the ladder up
to mary anns window at the inn was prob-
ably the one who had got her now


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  thetis then believed that she saw a solu-
tion to the enigma

   if its not the indians she muttered
 its that mulatto and if its not the mulat-
to its that nasty stinkin little foreigner
may the lord help her i wish charles
or some one were here to tell me what to
do

  in this disorganized state the garrison
at the carrington house remained until
about twelve oclock that night when fred
and his party returned

chapter xxiii

the prisoner



a fter allowing mary ann and her four
companions to pass in safety de car-
dac and jude held a long consultation
the result of which was to bind the two
schemers more closely together paul had
promised that no matter what happened
he would stand by jude until frederick
pope was killed the creole had vainly
endeavored to discover why jude bore such
enmity toward fred the ex-slave would
not reveal his secret but he solemnly prom-
ised de cardac that come what might he
would not desert him until mary ann was
his

  the conspirators had overheard most of
the discussion at freds cabin and they
knew where the party of armed women had
gone they followed them and secreted
themselves in the neighborhood of the car-
rington house

  for four days they spied upon the place
during which time it just happened that
mary ann never left the house paul and
the mulatto took turns at watching they
dared not make an open attack but bided
their opportunity

  de cardac was like one possessed hectic
in his intentions to achieve the fiendish
purpose upon which he had staked every-
thing and toward which jude with the
cunning of the devil himself was constant-
ly inciting him

  the mulatto hated and the white man
loved these two opposite passions burned
in them at white heat and produced the
same result the desire to compass the de-

struction of the life and happiness of fred-
erick pope and the undoing of his wife
nothing was too low nothing too mean for
them to stoop to in order that they might
gratify their evil lusts

  on the night of the panther scare when
mary ann emerged from the house de
cardac had been hiding very near the door
as the woman rushed out into the dark-
ness she was clearly revealed in the bright
light which streamed through the open door

  paul realized his advantage mary ann
had only taken a few steps when he crept
after her skirting the path of light he
stole through the darkness divesting him-
self of his coat he sprang upon the unsus-
pecting girl and threw the coat over her
head

   at first she was so astonished that she
made no cry nor did she struggle to free
herself her gun slipped from her relaxed
fingers and dropped silently upon the grass
de cardac pinioned her arms tightly to her
sides and lifting her off her feet ran with
his burden toward where the horses were
hidden

  paul was far from having recovered his
usual strength but mary ann was light
and besides now that he was achieving vic-
tory he seemed possessed of an almost su-
perhuman power

  the woman taken so completely by sur-
prise could make little resistance the
arms that held her seemed made of iron
and were so hot that they seemed to burn
through her clothes she was dazed more
than she was frightened she attempted
to cry out but no sound escaped through
the heavy coat

  in a few ninutes paul had joined jude
then mary ann was bound her arms
strapped to her sides her feet tied together
the coat was not taken from her head and
paul continued to hold it tightly in place
while he whispered directions to the mulatto
mary ann could scarcely breathe and
gasped pitifully for air trembling and twist-
ing as she was changed from the hands of
one of the captors to those of the other

  then like a sack of meal she was lifted
onto a horse and placed in the arms of paul
de cardac

  all this had taken place before thetis
texas fever



carrington had started to the branch mary
ann faintly heard the calls of her friends
but she could make no reply

  she had not heard pauls whispers to
jude because the cautious creole had spoken
so softly and she did not know who held
her but through instinct she divined the
identity of the man in whose throbbing arms
she lay and it was characteristic of her
that anger surged much more strongly in her
than did fear

  the horses were first walked very cau-
tiously their hoofs had been muffled but
in spite of everything a certain amount of
noise was made had it not been that at
just this time thetis carrington was com-
pletely absorbed in her efforts to kill the
panther she would probably have heard the
fugitives

  for the moment de cardac believed that
her shots were directed against themselves
he urged his horse into a gallop and jude
did likewise although the mulatto remarked
that the commotion was from the far side of
the house and over in the direction of the
branch

  then de cardac recalled the panther and
the fright of the negroes he had been near
enough to the house to overhear all the con-
versation which had taken place when the
terrified water-carriers returned

  he explained the affair to jude and then
suggested that he thought it safe to pause
for a moment and properly gag the prisoner

   shes breathing so hard that im afraid
something awful will happen if i keep this
coat over her head much longer he an-
nounced

   ive got a gag made jude replied
 but be mighty careful shell holler if
she gets a chance

   i think we are far enough away paul
persisted he was afraid that mary ann
was already suffocated

  he took the coat from her head she
had suffered considerably the first intake
of breath hurt her and she struggled away
from the man in whose arms she lay one
cry she gave paul then her eyes
caught sight of jude and she was struck
dumb

  the mulatto took advantage of this mo-
ment to insert the gag between her teeth

she at first made no effort to resist and
when she came to herself sufficiently to
struggle it was too late

  her eyes stared at the murderer and she
trembled for now she realized the enormity
of her danger the mulatto glared ma-
liciously back then without a word he re-
mounted and the cavalcade resumed its
flight through the night

  the chill air blew about them a wind
was sweeping over the prairies and the grass
bent and flowed beneath it like black sheets
of water a strange expectancy hung over
the fields as though a storm wrere brewing

  the man against whose breast she rested
held her more tightly as they galloped for-
ward she felt his bodys heat flowing into
her it was offensive to her but she could
not draw away from time to time she
would look at him in an attempt to make
her eyes speak her aversion but whenever
she did so de cardac would lean down
and kiss her defenseless cheek or throat or
hair

  angrily she attempted to protect herself
but it was all vain she was too firmly
bound the ride continued neither of
the men spoke jude was slightly in ad
vance and did not look back

  de cardac was fast being roused to a
frenzy of passion he was like a drunken
man and the captive woman was terrified
by the prospect of the awful fate which she
felt steadily advancing toward her

  once jude looked at them and with a
meaning leer suggested that it was now
quite safe to take  the stopper  from her
mouth paul was on the verge of doing
this but he was afraid

   her crjes might be heard he remarked
ruefully gazing upon the lips which the gag
protected from his amorous assaults

  for a long while they rode the night
had now become sinister in its hushed
silence the wind had ceased but a storm
was gathering

  could it be possible thought mary ann
that this was really herself was she really
here riding across these prairies and how
had de cardac and jude come together
what was their object whither were they
taking her would fred ever find her and
if he did would it be too late


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  where was he now and how had de
cardac come to be lurking in wait for her
beside the carringtons door could some-
thing have happened to fred had these
villains already made away with him be-
fore attempting to capture her

  suddenly her wretched questioning
thoughts were broken jude drew rein
and de cardac who was intent upon fond-
ling his prey did not notice in time and
dashed into the other horse

  the mulatto caught angrily at the white
mans bridle  take care he warned

  de cardac had been almost unhorsed
and iary ann nearly slipped from his
arms her knees were crushed against the
flank of judes mount she was not seri-
ously hurt but she had been forced dumbly
to endure considerable pain

  paul realizing this for although she
could make no complaint her eyes told
of her suffering he began to pat and
stroke and coo over her as one does over
a child that is hurt

  the mulatto interrupted him and dis-
gustedly announced  leave her erlone
somebodys cornin

   i dont hear anything paul spoke
like a man in a dream

   hear them now jude persisted  a
lot of em

   yes paul cried  i do hear them
who do you suppose it can be

  mary ann heard them also and in her
heart sprang the exultant hope that these
gallant riders would prove to be her res-
cuers

   they are certainly coming this way
paul declared

   yes jude agreed  and they mustnt
see her

   no of course not we must hide our-
selves from view paul looked about
desperately

  but where what should they do
where should they go

   if we hide her in die grass de cardac
suggested  we can ride past them and
then come back for her-

   and let em see me the mulatto cried
 no sirree

  paul had forgotten that his companion
was a hunted man

   they may not see us at all he began

   takin no chances jude declared

  as he spoke he sprang from his horse
then stood silently listening to the approach-
ing horsemen who could now be heard dis-
tinctly  this way will be safe he an-
nounced after he had calculated the prob-
able course to be taken by the oncoming
riders

   you help me de cardac cried in
alarm  help take her down

  hurriedly the defenseless woman was
transformed from the abhorred arms of paul
de cardac to the more abhorrent embrace
of the mulatto she was carried a short
distance and dropped in the grass which
was brushed back into place again

  while this was being done mary ann was
wondering what would happen if one of the
unknown horsemen should ride over her
would she be killed or only mangled
would the horseman pause and investigate
what he stumbled upon or would he think
it the body of some dead animal and ride
on

  meanwhile jude had taken the two horses
and led them a considerable distance away
where he hobbled them when he returned
he found paul hovering over mary ann

   dont talk any more the mulatto
warned him  they are in easy hearing
distance now

  the two men squatted in the grass and
anxiously waited for the horsemen to pass
by the big party laughing and talking
drew nearer suddenly jude clutched at the
arm of his companion

   do you hear he whispered  its
him

  they recognized the leader of die party
it was frederick pope

  mary ann had also recognized that voice
yet she could not make a sound nor lift a
finger to indicate her presence

   im goin to finish him dis time jude
whispered

  no paul fiercely objected fool
dont fire he clutched at the mulatto
who had already unslung his rifle  well
all be murdered

   what do i care if hes already dead
jude hissed

   you must not paul pleaded  thats
back to the moil



not our bargain i was to help you kill
him and you were to help me get her

   well havent i done it jude remon-
strated

  almost insane with fear paul de cardac
argued with the bloodthirsty mulatto
was this to be the end of all his hopes and
wild desires was he to be tricked like
this when success was almost his he
pleaded he threatened he prayed to this
fiend who crouched beside him trembling

to be concluded

like some wild animal about to spring upon
its victim

  meanwhile the horsemen were filing by
only a short distance away through the
grass the whispering men could vaguely
see them against the black sky which from
time to time was threaded by yellow zig-
zags of distant lightning

   so far jude had not fired but his gun
was still ready and de cardac expected
every moment to hear it explode

next week

in edward lemps several sectional book-
cases there was no volume authored by
honore de balzac this was merely an
accident of choice for i-emp was better
versed in literature than the ordinary busy
american business man

  however in the fact that lemp had
never read a line written by the immortal
frenchman who penned the  comedie
humaine lay a droll anachronism
though because balzac lived and worked
and joyed and sorrowed and died a long
time ago nobody knew this least of all
did lemp himself know it

  yet in person and in elements of mind
in big wise jane outlook upon life in
sense of humor ranging from chuckling
subtleties to gargantuan laughter lemp
was the living replica of balzac whose
name he knew rather dimly as that of a
writer of tales and that was all

  this sane sound sweet sense of humor
was iemps chief compensation in living

in turn fate had its jest with him in that
he did not know of his uncanny resemblance
to the master whose works he would have
reveled in had he known of them

  which proves only that fate is a subtler
jester than even the balzacs of this world

  upon a spring night wherein the chill of
winters aftermath lingered edward lemp
in smoking jacket and slippers sat at ease
in an armchair in his apartment within one
of the cloud-aspiring cubes on washington
heights

  about him were evidences of happiness
prosperity and as much contentment as
hectic metropolitan standards will allow

  first there was an ideal wife comrade
and coworker who sat next him knitting
in addition to fcese graces eunice lemp
possessed fchat of brunette beauty that had
not withered with the years now in mid-
dle life she appeared even younger and
her attraction which was of the tall and

stately order was accentuated by the few
streaks of silver in her black hair to
these lemp was wont to refer affectionate-
ly as times mining assay of his  lucky
strike

  secondarily was their housing for a
rental of a thousand dollars a year lemp
occupied this apartment on the eighth floor
large windows commanding a wonderful
view of new york they had a living-
room dining-room two bedrooms and a
smaller maids room a kitchen and bath
adam furniture and parquet floors lent dis-
tinctive touches the breezes whisking
about the lofty roof transformed with rustic
seats and trellises into a summer garden
made a most desirable luxury for the vari-
ous families during the evenings of the
heated months

  lemp laid down the book he had been
reading it was by the frenchman dumas
and had to do with the adventures of
 three musketeers

  placidly puffing at his brier pipe the
man who looked like balzac gazed from the
window over the wilderness of lights

  a thick crop of crisp waving dark hair
cut short covered his massive head the
brow was rather high the nose short and
with flaring nostrils evidencing a predomi-
nant sense of humor the lips finely cut
and inclined to thickness were shaded by
a small dark mustache clipped a la mode
his neck was short and thick but firm his
body somewhat bulky he was of average
height

  of his features however the eyes were
the most irresistible they were dark but
such was their magnetism that the be-
holder never thought of their hue but only
of their expression determined by their
owners mood of the moment

  sparkling with humor capable at once of
a caressing kindliness the lances of shrewd
raillery and keenly hungry for new im-
pressions patient but restlessly eager
brightened now with laughter and again
with scorn mirroring the ranges of philoso-
phy analysis pathos and pure fun capable
even of containing the shadow of tragedy
that is the legacy of the humorist they
were the eyes of a man who from a height
observes the grooves the eyes of balzac

  lemps eyes staring out over the noc-
turnal glory of manhattan now contained
a remote expression that told of retrospec-
tion presently he chuckled softly

  what is it edward in the low
sweet melodious voice of his wife was an
undertone of anticipation twenty years
of companionship with lemp had bred no
spirit of boredom of which pessimism is
the parent lemp was that most refresh-
ing of entities an optimist with a brain an
asset which enabled him to be always dif-
ferent

  he blew a ring of smoke his eyes
twinkled as he glanced across at her he
spoke his deep voice an ursine growl of
gentleness

   i was thinking  of blazed trails and
tangents eunie i was remembering how
often we had gazed out over these chinese
lanterns strung in the big joss house with
the feeling that  this world is not my home
i was remembering up-state and twenty-
no eighteen-years ago

  she returned his rather wistful smile
her own smile was a little melancholy with
no tinge of bitterness it was not in her
nature to retain acids of thought

   you were thinking of the old dream
she answered gently   castes in spain 
take so many forms in the questing ours
was that of the farming lands we hoped one
day to own

   yes he assented  odd isnt it how-
two persons who so love the open spaces
must limit them to elevator excursions to
the roof of a twenty-story building for
three months in the year and people who
have them are yearning for the canons of
the city i have a theory that old man
fate has been in business so long that he
has contracted creeping palsy that would
account for his spilling the beans

   sometimes she pursued her mind
turning with his own to life currents that
had sped  during those first two years of
our married life in rochester with you in
the office and  busy in the little flat that
farm would be right in monroe county on
the bank of the genesee river again it
would be in the middle west and per-
haps the next week in california once we
discussed-if ever we could get a thousand
back to the moil



dollars ahead you remember-buying one
of those abandoned farms in new england
and developing it our farm was one of
migratory horizons

   i remember assented her husband
 which migration we were obliged to
emulate just after our talk about the
new england farm along came the panic
and panned the dream and incidentally
my job long before the cyclone had
reached the sighing stage  was down here
engaged in a wild-eyed hunt for work
leaving you with your mother then i got
that little twenty dollar clerkship and you
came on and bravely fought out the met-
ropolitan game with me shoulder to shoul-
der-

   and now she smiled  its not so
bad

   six thousand a year would be pretty
good in -rochester he agreed philosophi-
cally  and even here with the war prices
getting their sixth wind we manage to keep
abreast of living expenses

  he glanced down quizzically at the
volume of dumas in his lap  but i won-
der what the  three musketeers  would do
to the cabaret hat boys he added

  the bell at the entrance door to the
apartment rang vigorously from the
kitchen came the brisk steps of the maid
soon she entered the room with a small
yellow envelope

   telegram for mr lemp she an-
nounced and went back to the confines of
the kitchen

  he tore open the envelope and read the
message  h-m he murmured as he
glanced at the signature  he hasnt writ-
ten to me in a year probably somethings
wrong

  he finished reading and looked up
 there is he announced  hes lost his
job

   who is he asked mrs lemp

   tom osgood

 oh

   you remember him then he called a
couple of times when we lived in rochester
a boyhood friend of mine weve main-
tained a desultory correspondence well
this time hes got a real trouble he always
had a lot of imaginary ones

   he wires hes down and out that his
need is desperate and he thinks i could
help him to connect after some plan he
has formed he wants to know if we can
put him up for a few days while i exert
my influence for him id starve before id
send such a yowl either over the wire or
under a sealed envelope but tom is tom
and always will be

   how about it eunie-shall i wire him
to trot along down here youre the
doctor

  mrs i-emps thought had kept pace with
his words rarely congenial they had
grown to be quite sufficient to themselves
and visitors were rare at the apartment
also their scale of living did not admit of
much entertaining

  of recent years they had fallen more
deeply into the easy habits of metropolitan
life in a financial sense and their outlay
kept pace with their income with the
rising cost of living they would now have
been at a loss to figure how to correct this
even if they had been disposed to do so

  however eunice whose heart was kind-
ly had decided without hesitation  by all
means dear wire him to come she urged

  youd better step down to the telegraph-
office and send him a night message if hes
down and out the poor fellow must be wor-
rying terribly you will be able to do
something for him doubtless

  edward lemp changed his pipe for a
cigar and secured hat coat and stick
good little girl he growled affection-
ately though eunice was as tall as he was
 youre an artist you contrived to sound
as if you liked the idea when two people
become settled down along in the meridian
its hard to consider being disturbed isnt
it selfish i grant you but quite a hu-
man offense

  he turned at the door his sparkling gaze
seeking hers

   when we were kids together tom used
to be afraid of his shadow he told her
 that ou-ht not to affect him down here
there are too many lights he wont have
any shadow in little old new york

  northward over the courier wires flashed
the night message about ten oclock the


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  next morning while lemp was busy at his
 desk down-town came a second telegram
from osgood

                               syracuse g am

      message received thanks old man for
    old-times sake am on way arrive new
    york s pm	osgood

    lemps eyes contracted and his lips
  pursed in a low whistle as he read the
  yellow sheet

     haunted the telegraph-office at ro-
  chester till my reply got through ran his
  thought  must have been up all night
  for he caught the earliest train this morn-
  ing and sent this message en route

     theres enterprise for you by george
  if everybody showed as much enterprise
  holding a job as in getting another when
  it is gone office forces would stay put con-
  siderably more than they do

    he studied the telegram again his criti-
  cal cool business sense concerned with its
  phrasing it was waily whiney almost
  hysterical in tone it was the communica-
  tion of a man whose courage was unequal to
   swinging a bluff

    that it required real courage in the vi-
  cissitudes of life to thus muster ones nerve-
  to at least a seeming of assurance lemp
  well knew from observation-and from ex-
  perience

   poor old tom somehow lemp ap-
 plied the adjective now as he had done in
 the far past when he had been twenty-
 five and osgood twenty-three tom had
 always carried upon his shoulders the re-
 sponsibilities of a heavy if timorous ego
 he was apparently still doing it

    he was evidently in frightful luck now
  perhaps near his last dollar and approach-
  ing the meridian of life which brings either
  the promise of ultimate success or the en-
  croaching shadows of failure lemp must
  do what he could

    he telephoned his wife that osgood would
  arrive at five oclock and that he would
  meet him and bring him up for dinner
  then turned to the accumulated work upon
  his desk as office manager of the peerless
  agricultural implement company with
  factories up-state and business headquar-
  ters in new york his days were w-ell filled

  five oclock found lemp at the grand
central terminal he had postponed an
important late conference to render the
courtesy to his old friend

  at six oclock he sighed with relief as the
belated train began to discharge its quota
of passengers from his position near the
end of the rope behind which stood folk
awaiting friends he scanned the faces of
passing passengers

  he saw osgood first though the little
mans anxious eyes were boring like gimlets
this way and that in search of him tom
had requisitioned the services of no  red
cap he was carrying his own bag

  lemp stepped around the end of the line
 hello tom old boy  he greeted  how
are you here give me your bag come
on lets get a taxi your train was late
he strode across the concourse toward
forty-second street the little gray man
trotting at his side with swift nervous
steps gray he was from head to heel
his fedora was gray likewise his hair and
the flesh of his face that was webbed and
spun with wrinkles of lifelong worry he
wore a business suit of dingy gray and a
gray overcoat there was a sprinkling of
gray dust on his shoes for he had inhabited
the smoker all the way from rochester
finally from his thin gray lips poured a
torrent of nervous gray phrases

   i dont know when ive been so glad to
see any one ed coming along the line
just now looking for you i didnt see you
and i wondered if anything had happened
for a minute ed i felt as if i didnt have
a friend left in the world i tell you 
was glad to get your message when a
fellows down and out its a thing like that
puts heart in him the feeling that some-
where theres a friend he can rely on

   here we are tom amiably growled
lemp hailing a taxi driver and giving him
the address  climb in well be having
some dinner before you know- it youve
had a long trip

    i didnt sleep last night confessed
osgood as the vehicle began spinning over
the asphalt up-town  i hung around till
i got your message then i went home and
smoked a while and packed to get the
first train how glad my wife was at the
back to the moil



chance she told me to tell you how grate-
ful she was at your interest i was so
worked up with everything that i didnt
think to wire you i was on the way till i
reached syracuse

  lemps shrewd eyes narrowed as he lis-
tened to the disjointed almost breathless
sentences flung in the queer cackling un-
even voice he so well remembered

  the man who looked like balzac was as
keenly alive to the bewildering ramifica-
tions of the human comedy as had been
the master he had achieved his knowl-
edge in the same intimate way through
battling with obstacles wrestling and strug-
gling in the mob tasting both the dregs of
defeat and the sweets of victory reading
men not through a glass darkly but face
to face

  for years in manhattan most relentless
of the worlds marts and its most inspiring
lemp had experienced his ups and downs
and had witnessed those of others he had
shared in and observed scenes of exhilara-
tion and of depression he had seen men
glad beyond reason-and men with suffi-
cient reason on the rack of worriment

  but never in his life had he seen a man
in the blue funk under which tom osgood
was laboring

  of necessity he was silent since tom was
talking incessantly giving him some of the
details attaching to his perturbed state of
mind

   it came out of a clear sky ed yester-
day morning after fifteen years of honest
work and making good think of it called
by the old man into the office given two
weeks pay and told that a relative of the
manager had to be taken care of and i
was the goat that my job must be turned
over to him is there any justice in the
world

  lemp studied the flare of the haggard
eyes in the gray face as the taxi whirled by
a street-lamp there was a deep cleft be-
tween the gray brows lemp recalled that
it had been indelibled there before osgood
had reached his early twenties it had
been etched not by concentration but by
worry

  aloud he answered with dry truth
 oh yes theres justice in the world but

dont start to hunt for it you wouldnt
have time for anything else

  thats just it agreed osgood with
tragic earnestness absorbing the generality
into the whirling orbit of his private affairs
 time thats it im up against it ed
ive got to have a job

   well soothed lemp  well see if we
cant get you one ill tell you what mrs
lemp has an engagement out this evening
something she contracted a week ago so
after dinner you and i will have the place
to ourselves and well whale out your prob-
lem meanwhile dont worry the world
owes you a living and youll keep right on
collecting were nearly there now and
you must be hungry

  but the exercised spirit of osgood re-
sponded to no gastronomical lure

   not so very he responded rather ab-
sently  abbie put me up a lunch and i
ate some of ttn the train i gave the
rest to a dog that wras tied up in the ex-
press car ahead it kept him still for a
while he made me nervous with his in-
cessant howling

    its all very well for you to say not to
worry ed but how can i help it re-
member that old poem that tells how a fel-
low feels when he is out of a job its
different with you ed youre fixed you
havent sftything to worry about things
have gone fine with you

  at the throb of self-pity in osgoods
voice a faint smile wrinkled the corners of
his hosts mouth his glance grown quiz-
zical veered through the window to the
tintinnabulating street they were traversing

  had osgood forgotten the crash of
eighteen years before which while not af-
fecting his position had sent lemp a straw
blown by winds of chance scurrying down
into this maelstrom did he assume that
this town had been conquered even in
modest degree while lemp lay upon flow-
ery beds of ease more than this did he
believe that it did not require the most in-
tense concentration in this town of fiercest
competition to hold the ground already
won

  his gaze returned to osgood while he
remembered that with the selfishness of
fear tom was not considering the problems


argosy and railroad mans magazine

of the great world at all but only those of
his little individual one

   let me see he mused  you were with
the apex agricultural people werent you
 yes miserably assented osgood  i
wds

   and were you thinking of locating
here

  tom straightened in swift dismay and
stared across at him with visible shrink-
ing his look swerved to the outer jam
through which the taxicab was threading its
way at the moment to the hordes of people
upon the walk scurrying to subway ele-
vated stations and to surface cars

   what he squealed in positive terror
tackle new york when im past forty
do you think im crazy ed if i didnt
dare to do it when i was young what
chance would i have now

  lemp contrived to preserve his gravity
 well he admitted regretfully  the old
town is bigger than she was when you and
i were young tom and thats a fact and
shell be still bigger when were old
old despairingly cawed osgood
 thats the word and were old now
for the next five minutes he discoursed
with gloomy enthusiam upon the  dead
line  which his own fluttering mind had
long since created it seemed that he had
fastened upon the exploded osw theory
as business law and gospel that he figured
that after a man had passedjjje portal of
forty years he was permitted perhaps to
continue cringingly to toil only through for-
tunate sufferance

  he made it plain that because of this
accident of his years-realized bccause he
had made it his business to grow older with
every year instead of wiser-he hail come
to new york not to demand a right but to
beg a favor

  lemp listened his droll visage fixed at
respectful attention as he heard the non-
sense he realized how far away from os-
good he had grown during these years

  this fact he knew well he owed to new
york the crucible wherein in fire the pre-
cious metal of the spirit is separated from
the dross it came to him that never be-
fore had he realized the development the
town had brought to him till now when

face to face with this pitiful being who had
not dared but a prey to his silly fears had
slipped backward with the years

  because lemp had grown bigger under
the lash of manhattan he accepted this
sudden realization of values not with any
sense of superiority to osgood but with
humility

  the taxicab stopped in the midst of his
raven croakings osgood stopped and looked
about bewilderedly

   where are we he asked with a ner-
vous start

   at my home smiled lemp reassuring-
ly  wheres your bag well have
dinner and then well have ample time to
talk things over

   i havent been to new york in fifteen
years chattered tom clambering out
after him and staring about  abbie and
i have talked of coming but we felt we
couldnt afford it is that where you live
some building his glance flashed up the
tiers of windows as he walked with lemp
toward the entrance

   fair answered edward nonchalantly
through knowledge of apartments much
more ornate look out his ready
hand caught osgood whose gaze was still
upward from stumbling at the lower step

   didnt suppose id be coming down on
an errand like this muttered tom with a
sorry grimace as they entered the vestibule
of the house

  round this wandered his look grown
awed and respectful as he noted the color-
ful appointments and the gilding the girl
at the telephone board the negro elevator-
boy in buttons and blue

   gee ed pretty swell youve struck
it soft he whispered as they walked to-
ward the cage  i wish i could have struck
luck

  they were whirled upward to lemps
apartment where eunice graciously greeted
the guest who was shown to his room to
make hasty preparations for dinner which
had been waiting

  osgood had the grace to refrain from any
allusion to his plight while at table so mrs
lemp was spared the ordeal through which
her husband had passed however he was
palpably ill at ease he ate but little it
back to the moil



was evident to her that he was consumed
by anxiety connected with his errand to
their home

  it was with relief wholly irrepressible
that she left after dinner to fulfil her en-
gagement her concern for edward who
was left to the mercies of this strange being
was tempered by the knowledge that some-
how through the processes of his unique
mind that could manufacture sunlight from
the deepest shadows he could extract di-
version from the enforced companionship

   now tom suggested lemp as they
took easy chairs in the living-room smok-
ing two of his choice cigars  tell me just
what youd like to do  gather you have
some plan more or less definite spill it
into my sympathetic ear old scout

  osgood smoking furiously fidgeted in
his chair his sharp-featured clean-shaven
face snarled into an expression of utter tor-
ture his restless gray eyes which had
been darting restlessly around the room
now fixed upon lemps calm good-humored
face

   when i got that word from the old man
yesterday morning i was knocked silly
ed he answered  then i heard some-
thing by accident-which i hope proves
lucky-that made me think of you and
i figured id he standing a better chance to
be right on the ground so i wired you
and hear  am

   now ive been for fifteen years with
the apex people your principal competitors
-though they dont turn out as good a
product as the peerless he added with
haste chat lemp did not relish it savored
of insincerity born of osgoods need

   the peerless makes the best line of
farming implements on earth pursued os-
good fulsomely  every one knows that
ive thought for a long time id like to be
with them-with you but you know a
man gets rather used to a place-he hates
to change

  he paused swallowing dryly the mag-
netic glance of lemp was upon him he
found it rather disturbing he contrived to
continue his nervousness increasing

   i can sell the goods my record proves
that ed but you cant teach any old dog
new tricks im used to that territory i

dont want to leave it im used to it-like
you are to new york

  lemp smiled inwardly with the eyes and
lips of his memory how he would enjoy
leaving new york for the north if he
could outwardly he only nodded gravely
with the judicial manner he invariably as-
sumed in moments of business

   after lunch yesterday-though i didnt
eat any being so worked up-i heard from
prentiss your man that has worked mon-
roe and adjacent counties for ten years
that hed just mailed a letter to your office
here resigning hes going west so im
down to see if you wont put me on in his
place

   see the advantage i know the
ground the people  can swing right in
there i can deliver the goods youll see
i dont want to go anywhere else id be
lost anywhere else im so used to it and
im sure i could sell more goods for the
peerless than i ever did for the apex its
a better house and besides i wouldnt
feel any too good toward the apex crowd
for letting me go

  he was pleading now like a man for his
life that job was a supreme necessity to
him there were evidences enough that he
had not much money that he was not
financially equipped to remove with his
family to a new field to say nothing of the
torture of uprooting to a man of his settled
groove

   you have children perhaps you wish
to continue in school at rochester asked
lemp  you havent told me much of
yourself in your infrequent letters

   no answered the little man staring
hungrily at him  there are just abbie
and myself we never felt we could afford
children that territory doesnt carry
much of a salary-

  a momentary pang assailed lemps
heart neither had he and eunice had
children but they would have been wel-
comed had they come

  he stifled the feeling and stared at os-
good curiously  just you and your
wife he asked  i should think that you
would want to try new territory in that
case just the adventure of it the excite-
ment of blazing new trails


argosy and railroad mans magazine

      new trails  echoed osgood in in-
 credulous dismay  when im past
 forty

    thats only a start answered lemp
 reflectively  a man doesnt begin to
 think till hes past forty tom id like
 to blaze a new trail-somewhere-myself
 he was thinking of the old dream that he
 and eunice had laid by

     but you dont observed osgood slyly
  you stay right here in new york
  inference was unmistakable  it is
 not because i am afraid to try that i do not
 blaze that trail he answered quietly  i
 owe this old town a debt which i can never
 repay it taught me early in the game to
 conquer fear

   but tom osgood had not heard the
 words his mind turning constantly in-
 ward through stress of his plight had re-
 turned to that job he so ardently desired

     thats the situation ed he imparted
 huskily throwing all his scattered forces in-
 to a final despairing appeal  im offering
 you my services for the best money you
 can give me to start i dont think i ought
 to get less tbrthe apex people paid me
 but we coiiw adjust that i think and if
 i get the chance ill give that new relative
 of the apex manager whos grabbed my
 job a run for his money ill promise you
 that

    wriggling in his chair he pursued his
 theme with the fierceness of a cornered rat

     abbie feels the same as i do when i
 left she felt the thing turning out as it has
 with prentiss leaving was a chance from
 heaven i cant bear to think how shell
 feel if i go back licked and tell her i
 couldnt get it put vourself in my place
 ed

   he stared hungrily again and summed
 up with a tremor in his voice

   if i get the chance im your debtor
 for life if i dont ill take the train back
 to rochester in the morning and see if
 theres something else i could pick up
 though its dull in the old town just now
 but ive got to do something i havent
 much-money

    he stopped swallowingdryly and mute-
 ly watched lemp who sat pondering it
 was a problem he had to settle old friend-

 ship inexplicable as he now felt it to have
 been won with him

  he looked up  t-om he said  you
have been misinformed regarding my posi-
tion with the peerless concern i think i
am not the sales manager but the office
manager

   hugh lloyd the sales manager is out
of town he will return to-morrow or the
next day i will use my influence to pro-
cure for you an interview with him at the
earliest moment after he returns you must
do your best to sell yourself to him lloyd
is a mighty good fellow but in business
hes the perfection in that anomaly of
modern business that makes for results-a
hard-headed razor

  he was eying osgood sharply tom
shivered timorously forgetting in his rag-
ing egotism even to thank lemp for this
evidence of interest

   ive heard of him he said  from pren-
tiss his tone trembled  but ill do my
best to please him if he gives me the
chance

   all right lemp rose he had heard
quite enough of this sort of talk  youve
had a long trip following a sleepless night
he suggested kindly  youd better turn
in now and get some sleep perhaps lloyd
will get back to-morrow hes coming from
the west and you will need to be at your
best to talk with him

   yes ed thats a good idea i guess
dully answered osgood getting to his feet
 youre mighty fine old man will you
see lloyd after i do and say all you can
for me

  lemp nodded as he surveyed the pitiful
figure this little man near middle life who
was palpably so close to the end of his re-
sources who had not even the asset of a
 bluff as was always the case in per-
sonal affairs his warm heart rose in arms
against his cold business judgment

  he nodded silently while the tongue of
his mind murmured  yes you poor little
mutt ill say all i can for you-and more 

  he showed osgood to his room and light-
ing his pipe picked up the volume by du-
mas and resumed reading the adventures
of three fearless musketeers

  he heard tom stirring about in his
back to the moil



room then for a few moments all was quiet
and he supposed his guest had fallen asleep

  his pipe did not draw well and he tip-
toed back for a package of cleaners that he
kept in the kitchen osgoods door was
ajar and tom sat by the window with his
back toward lemp whose approach he did
not hear he was still fully dressed and
was bent over some task to the accompani-
ment of a queer rhythmic swishing sound

  lemps gaze absorbed toms employ-
ment and grew quizzical sparkling with
laughter taking more pains then before
to remain unheard he passed on and
secured his cleaners and tiptoed back to the
living-room to resume his reading of the ex-
ploits of dumass three heroes

  after a time he heard the bedroom door
close then more dimly the creakings pro-
duced by uneasy tossings and once a dis-
mal muffled groan it told of the little
mans continued state of cruel nervousness
as he writhed hoping and fearing fate as it
would accompany lloyd the sales manager
of the peerless concern who was now speed-
ing from the west

  later after mrs lemp had returned
home and retired she opened drowsy eyes
at the sound of a low chuckle from her hus-
band who stood by the dresser removing
his collar

   what is it edward she asked

   nothing eunice go to sleep he told
her

  because of his fine instincts exercised
in behalf of the guest who had now fallen
into a troubled sleep of exhaustion in his
chamber he could not tell even eunice his
pal what he had seen when he passed
toms open door

  osgood oblivious to the fact that he had
not closed his door had sat humped in his
chair like an african toiling toward an im-
maculate appearance the following day

  he had brought along paste cloths
brushes and all the paraphernalia-and
was shining his shoes

  eunice lemp was a placid woman but
even her well-controlled nerves were ruffled
by tom osgoods antics the following
morning and over the luncheon hour

 i hardly think lloyd will return before
to-morrow lemp had suggested at the

breakfast table  and anyway hed have
quite a little of accumulated business await-
ing him better take it easy to-day tom
and stroll around and look over the city
tom buttering a roll fidgeted  he
might get back to-day he suggested with
timorous hope  and he might have a mo-
ment he could give me say this afternoon
of course use your own judgment ed but
you see its a serious matter with me per-
haps id better stick around here and if
there came a chance to see him provided
he gets in you could phone me and id
come right down of course i cant spend
too much-time if theres nothing here i
must be getting back to rochester and see
if i can dig up something

  his shifting gaze dropped to his plate
lemp could not resist casting a sparkling
glance at eunice who sat lovely in morn-
ing gown and crisp breakfast cap demure
little imps flashed in response from her dark
eyes

   all right tom assented lemp cor-
dially  stick around and ill send you
word if there is any

  so tom  stuck around  all the morn-
ing and made eunice as nervo-s as a res-
tive cat would have done she perceived
early that he did not want to talk for
which he was profoundly grateful how-
ever he padded miserably about the living-
room unable to occupy himself with read-
ing or resting for more than a few minutes
at a time and altogether presented the
aspect of a man with several loads on his
mind alpof them of the interior pattern

  for a long time too he busied himself
in the bath-room from which issued mys-
terious swashing sounds

  at luncheon he ate but little and that in
jerky fashion once he almost jumped
from his chair as the telephone bell jangled
but it was a call from one of mrs lemps
friends he eyed her almost with resent-
ment as she returned to her seat

  at last however at two oclock came a
second call mrs lemp hastened to an-
swer it osgood seated in an uneasy chair
in the living-room bent forward with tor-
tured face his hands gripping the arms
tensely

    yes dear he heard mrs lemp say


argosy and railroad mans magazine

his pulses leaped with anticipation this
gave place to blank despair as he waited
while she listened at the telephone it was
probably some other woman friend who was
telephoning to her women always called
one another  dear

   oh very well dear he heard her say

  the little man heard the swish of her
silken skirts as she returned toward the
living-room he cowered in his chair star-
ing hungrily perhaps after all-per-
haps-

   oh mr osgood came mrs lemps
low vibrant musical voice  mr lemp
was phoning he has arranged that you
meet mr lloyd who will give you a few
minutes at three oclock

  up from his chair sprang tom osgood
as if shot therefrom by some fantastic
spring his webbed little face turned red
and white thus furnishing a vivid contrast
to his blue mood of a moment previous

 oh mrs lemp-thank you he
stammered  i guess ill start down-town
now if you dont mind and hang around
i want to see mr lemp again for a few
minutes before i see mr lloyd

  eunice didnt mind at all and in a few
moments she sat enjoying the first moments
of peace she had experienced since rising
tom osgood was about as calm company
as an equinoctial storm

  presently while passing the bath-room
toward the kitchen to give some directions
to the maid she glanced in at the open
door she stopped and stared then went
in to investigate 

  the early spring weather remained raw
and the steam-pipes of the apartment were
purring the radiator was mrs lemps
magnet

  ranged neatly drying over its top was
an array of the osgood laundry a pair
of cotton half-hose of raven hue and a
suit of b y ds and two handkerchiefs
had been washed with toilet soap in the
bathtub and hung thereon

  underneath these intimate necessities of
wear placed so to protect them from
streaks of iron-rust from the radiator os-
good had carefully laid one of his hostesss
best embroidered towels

  instant battle-light leaped into the laftys

usually placid eyes she stretched forth
vengeful hands to cast the garments into a
comer and to rescue her insulted towel

  midway her slender beautifully mani-
cured hands fell helplessly at her sides
she shook her head with a hopeless gesture
and turned away

  whatever else he was osgood was a
guest

  nor she decided with the fine instincts
roused by this fact of his guesthood would
she tell her husband of the incident

  osgood would doubtless retrieve his
laundry upon his return it should be a
deep dark secret between them

   now see here tom cautioned lemp
in his office one minute before three
oclock  lloyds a cross between a pile-
driver and a cleaver mind what i tell you
not a syllable to him about hard luck or
personal affairs just business see and
buck up youre not going to the death-
chair at sing sing youre going to ask for
what is your inalienable right-a job 

   ill remember gulped the trembling
little tom and walked jerkily out of the
office and down the corridor lenip
watched him go with a slow shake of the
head

  in five minutes he was back a victim oi
the th degree of suspense

   i cant make him out he throbbed
miserably  hes-terrible im afraid
he got me-tangled he wants to see you

  it was fifteen years later as it seemed to
the little man nervously pacing edward
lemps office in reality it was less than
fifteen minutes

  sales manager lloyd a man with spiky
blond hair a cold-blue eye that could bore
through chilled steel and shoulders that
continued to advertise the fact that a num-
ber of years before he had decked the roster
of all-american football for three seasons
banged a massive fist on his desk following
a verbal give-and-take

   i tell you lemp this is too much and
then some he bawled  prentiss has re-
signed yes but hang it id have asked
him to do it in another month for ive got
a real man in mind t put in his place a
back to the moil



modern product that hates grooves like an
incipient traitor hates clemenceau the
tiger of france

   and here you want me to put on an-
other of these blasted old automatons that
walks up and down instead of ahead-

   hes younger than i am interposed
lemp wearily mopping his damp brow

  yes he is not yowled lloyd
 youre the youngest man in this con-
cern

   hell work his head off for you put
in edward again

  fie hasnt any head to work off
growled lloyd  hes an old woman

  lemp nodded slowly and rose  yes i
guess he is he admitted with deep guile
 i see i cant camouflage him any to you
im sorry to have taken your time old man
you see hes an old friend of mine as i
told you and i figured its only a matter of
the chance anyway its up to him to win
or fail and we need a man right awav
well ill tell him by-by

   wait lloyd banged the table again
and scowled down at it lemp waited his
face and his dark eyes inscrutable while
his cunning leaven worked quickly

  tell him ill put him on exploded
lloyd glowering affectionately at the man
who looked like balzac  you win you
old arch-plotter with the limber tongue

   but  dont want to see him again and
hes got to make good right from the very
start

   tell him to get back to rochester ill
write him instructions there and get t
hell out of here

  the spring twilight was deepening
after a hasty early dinner served in jig-
time for the jubilant osgoods convenience
he stood bag in hand at the door to the
lemps apartment mouthing his exuberant
farewells

  he was going to catch a subway train for
the station and was explaining his abrupt-
ness in deciding to return thus precipitately
to the moil he had explained it about a
dozen times

  unleashed like mountain torrents had
been his speech since lemp returned to
the office with the glad news yet its scope

was singularly restricted it concerned
only the  life saver  of the new job

   abbie will be so pleased so relieved
he bleated  im glad i sent her that tele-
gram first thing how can i ever repay
you ed for your kindness and you mrs
lemp its great to know a fellow has
such friends in the world when hes down
and oyt

   i wish i could stay over to-night and to-
morrow to visit the theater and see a little
of the town as you both suggested but i
dont feel i can afford the time i must get
back to rochester and prepare to start the
new job as soon as mr lloyd sends in-
structions oh i feel now as if i could
breathe again 

  eunice had grown used to his fantastic
exuberance by this time she only smiled
tolerantly

  a transitory shadow of worry renewed
traversed osgoods brow and snarled it into
its accustomed creases  i wonder if i can
hold this new job he quavered  im
getting along in years

  thrusting back a pitying disgust lemp
rallied him for the th time youre all
right tom a man is only as old as he
feels

  he added  mrs lemp and i would be
glad to see you and mrs osgood if ever again
we get up in the dear old country where
in the city are you living now

   oh answered osgood  were not in
the city for the last year weve been liv-
ing out on the farm in the town of daphne
and ive been taking the trolley into town
didnt-i tell you i guess i was too wor-
ried about losing my job to think of any-
thing else but thanks to you ed ive
got my foothold again

  what farm is that youre on asked
lemp  one youre renting i suppose

   oh no answered tom rather in-
differently i own it

  lemps dark eyes dilated as he pursued
 you remember old william becks farm
thats it he was my uncle he died and
left it to me

   well gasped lemp after a stunned
moment  what have you been worrying
about dont you work it

   what do i know about farming an-


argosy and railroad mans magazine

swered tom with a touch of irritation as
if others had asked him that question
 we save rent of course and raise enough
stuff to eat with part-time from the hired
man in the neighborhood but it takes a
good share of my salary from the job to pay
the taxes on the darned place

   well i really must go abbie and i
will be glad to have you stop off and pay
us a flier if ever youre through up that
way thank you both for your kindness
to a man in hard luck well good-by 
grabbing his bag he shot out of the door
and for the elevator a unique little figure in
gray worried now lest he miss his train

  lemp walked slowly into the living-room
and stood staring from the window mrs
lemp approached him

   that farm he spoke of she asked
 is it an abandoned farm of some kind
his eyes turned to hers held a strange
look

   its one i used to wish i owned he
answered  its one of the richest farms

in monroe county its worth fifty thou-
sand dollars if its worth a cent

  while she gazed at him overwhelmed
while to her mind rushed the memory of
their buried dream he stared out over the
great city now winking awake in its glories
of the night in this city their lot was
irretrievably cast while their hearts were
up among the hills toward which osgood
would soon be hurrying

   what is there to it i wonder he
asked thinking of the strangely mixed
scheme

  i wonder responded his wife in a
hushed tone

  then came to lemp his master compen-
sation for the business of living it was his
inextinguishable sense of humor

  he laughed great bellowing thunderous
laughter the mirth of balzac whom he re-
sembled in person and in mind and did not
know it

  his mirth was hysterically echoed by his
mate

a wayside prayer

     remember artist soul of mine	

         this green gold white and blue
         of may-time in the morning shine

        when every leaf is new

        how cotton-soft the white clouds rise	

         to drift in laggard train
         through the warm stretch of azure skies
         washed clcan by april rain

        remember dancing oer the grass
        winds such as corot knew

         flinging a fragrance as they pass
         of lilacs drenched with dew

         the thrush upon the tall oaks limb

         in leafy high survey

        tossing the rapture of his hymn
        through the green fields of may

         hold these my soul inviolate-

         clear colors of the spring

        soft winds that bid the thrushes mate
        and set the leaves aswing

         bird song and lilacs drenched with dew
         keep as they are to-day

        that they may pass in dream review
        when sleep has had her way

what first attracted me to mr betts
was his thoughtful gaze on the
w s s placard behind the bar
and then the half-guilty attention he be-
stowed on his well-filled glass

  he must have caught my grin for he
inched toward me with a friendly apolo-
getic smile

   savings done in some onusual ways
he confided softly  theres folks that
says the saloon takes the poor mans hard-
earned dollar and that gamblin is a curse
mebbe theyre right i aint savin

   but that guvment savin sign there
he went on encouraged by my discreet nod

 reminds me of a saloon an gamblin place
that was a regular savings bank for its
customers yes sir the only deposit-slips
used was the bar-checks and it seemed as
though about all the depositors had to
show for their money was a headache the
morning after but it actually saved
money for them-with interest

  having thus succeeded in tickling my
curiosity the stranger perversely lapsed
into an embarrassed silence  whats the
answer i demanded laughing and
taking advantage of the freemasonry among
all men at jordans i towed him to a cor-
ner table and signaled mike to stand by
with the appropriate refreshments

  argosy	

   some queer fish-quite soberly speaking
 -run into this famous cafe usually swirled
 east with the crowds that eddy off broad-
 ways restless stream at times square

   even mr betts-tim betts of cali-
 fornia as he introduced himself-was not
 without striking characteristics his big
 frame fleshed to portliness was draped
 decently in a quiet suit of pepper-and-salt
 his brown-straw hat with the wide floppy
 brim and the broad-toed shoes were not
 in themselves conspicuous

   yet somehow mr bettss appearance
 suggested a prosperous rancher not alto-
 gether at ease in his  going-to-town  togs
 the genial smile however masked a
 shrewdness and inflexibility of purpose
 that of a man who knew what he was about
 and was not lightly u be imposed upon

   strange tales are unfolded at jordans
 mr betts eased the strain across his chest
 by loosing the top coat-button mopped a
 bald forehead and began excepting many
 quaint embellishments unhappily forgot-
 ten i have endeavored here to set down
 his story in a straightforward narrative
 it is an odd tale of the desert of good
 cloaked in evil of baffling motives and of
 a friendship that almost passes understand-
 ing

   i gathered that when macdonald made
 his nerve-racking drive into death valley


argosy and railroad mans magazine

he was not the sinister figure that dry
gulch later was to blaspheme tightfisted
well perhaps a bit careful of the pennies
but ready to stake his all at the challenge
of any big venture

  men liked his nerve they liked him
so that when macdonald announced his
determination to ferret out the mysterious
source of  death valley  scottys treas-
ure the half-dozen seasoned prospectors he
invited were with him to a man

  the adventurers hotfooted it through the
entire length of lost valley and down
through the dread valley that yielded scot-
ty his never-failing supply of gold they
found plenty of salt licks and enough de-
posits of borax to chase all the roaches in
christendom but never a sign of scottys
treasure cache so they emerged from
death valley at the south where the amar-
gosa wash enters having acquired nothing
but disappointment and a thirst that chart-
ed their course direct as the crow flies to-
ward the nearest saloon at tecopa

  then a days journey south along the
amargosa river the prospectors made the
strike that established dry gulch at this
point in the river-bed they discovered
placer deposits yielding as high as six hun-
dred dollars worth of gold to the pan

  here almost on the boundary line be-
tween the california counties of inyo and
san bernardino with needle peak visible
to the northwest and owls head and rot-
ten peak to the south the prospectors set-
tled down among the lava beds the mes-
quite and the cacti to prove their luck
for mascot they had their choice of scor-
pion horned toad or rattler - lurking
among the sagebrush and yucca

ii

  the next glimpse of macdonald discov-
ers him at his mahogany desk in the presi-
dents office of an important bank in san
francisco with vast lumber interests and
other investments in the background

  while the men who shared with him the
perils of death valley still plug along at
dry gulch working claims which seem as
productive as ever yet scarcely a cent
wealthier than when they stumbled into
this arid region several years before

  every situation has its explanation the
dry gulchers pointed the accusing finger
at macdonald and their allusions to him
reeked of brimstone and sulfur

  in all fairness however macdonald
could not be held responsible for the gam-
bling mania that gripped the camp coinci-
dent with almost the first days panning of
gold

  macdonald alone kept his sanity he
panned gold diligently accumulated his
 pile  and promptly announced his in-
tention of returning to the coast there to
 be somebody

  upon leaving he aroused tremendous en-
thusiasm by describing his plan to build in
dry gulch immediately the  niftiest lit-
tle saloon and gambling emporium east of
frisco and west of monte carlo

  the first impulse of the dry gulchers
who had held the aces in the last games
had been to gather up their vast winnings
and bear macdonald company on his jour-
ney but now nothing would do but that
everybody must wait to pass opinion on the
proposed b burns saloon and casino
this result was nf doubt what macdonald
had coolly calculated upon

  then mr  foley  dugan came out of
nowhere opened the famous general store
and made living so comfortable for the
dry gulchers that none felt the urge to
hasten away  foley  nee pat dugan
was a wiry little irishman addicted to
those rambling whiskers vulgarly classified
as  foliage his capability amounted to
genius

   doc  yards request for a guitar and
the professors order of a costly importa-
tion of yellovv-pine timber and incense ce-
dar trim for his pretentious bungalow were
all alike to foley whatever his customers
wanted they got it was under foleys
stimulating activity that the crude shacks
straggling through the rough mining camp
gave way to an orderly arrangement of
comfortable frame or adobe cottages

  only a handful of chosen worthies were
added to the original few inhabitants the
dry gulchers were exclusive-liked to
pick their company and the splendid iso-
lation of dry gulch assisted their purpose
moreover every inhabitant did plain and
first national bank of faro



fancy shooting conscientiously and well
therefore trespassers about the sluices and
staked-out claims were few and all account-
ed for

  foley made life bearable until the b
burns saloon and casino bloomed swiftly
and exotically out of the desert its sur-
passing magnificence fulfilled macdonalds
promise to the letter

  the saloon shone resplendent in rose-
wood mahogany and plate-glass it was
stocked with really choice vintages and
liquors and a small but potent side-line of
narcotics which put curious strangers gen-
tly to slumber while the natives dallied with
high stakes in the casino adjoining

  the casino itself an extension wing of
the saloon was equipped not only with the
most up-to-date gambling paraphernalia
but also furnished tastefully with cosy
chairs handsome tables draperies and val-
uable prints besides affording an intimate
little grill where eccentric persons might
consume food or the coroner hold an in-
quest undisturbed

   sure thing-macdonald has went an
done his damnedest chortled mandy
swatt at the rollicking house-warming an
opinion that ever dry gulcher shared
then and thereafter

  that the b burns coiled its tentacles
about the community so quickly however
was due in no small measure to magnetic
doc yard who combined the genius of
versatility with the indomitable spirit of
the pioneer

  monotony was death to him he chafed
under the ternal sameness of draw poker
california jack dom pedro fan-tan and
ace-in-the-pot inspired by the gorgeous
new casino he introduced into camp a vol-
ume of the immortal hoyle starting at
 a with  all fours he led his enthus-
iastic comrades straightway through all the
card and dice games in the book to the
glossary

  thus gambling permanently became the
ruling motive for dry gulchs existence
before long only the highest possible stakes
seemed worth playing for so that the camp
routine came to be fixed in this wise

  for six days the miners labored at pan
rocker and sluice washing out the fine

golden scales coarser grains and even nug-
gets from the  placer  gravel hardly a
caim failed to pan at least its fifty ounces
of gold daily

  then on saturday afternoon each miner
gathered together his weekly dust tidied
up a bit and repaired to the general store
foley weighed out the dust and took each
miners orders for necessities and luxuries

  and on the evening of the same day or
in the wee hours of the next each miner
and foley came forth from the b bums
saloon and casino and made his more or
less erratic way to his own neat cottage-
virtually flat cleaned out busted

  macdonald had taken his weekly toll

  the more skilful among them might
have outwitted their evil genius and made
the  pile  each had set his heart upon
had it not been for this unwritten law be-
fore leaving the casino the winners in the
inter-hoyle card or dice match must play
the roulette-wheel faro or other gaming
device operated by the house

  this practise originally had expressed
the communitys gratitude for macdonalds
munificent gift but it was continued
through force of habit and precedent when
plain macdonald became known to them as
 pluto  macdonald and already was
cussed as a  grafter besides every dry
gulcher cherished a sneaking notion that
if he only could beat the b burns and
macdonald just once he could die smiling

   as soon as he would signify his intention
of  playing the house however all would
be over but the shouting-and the proprie-
tor did that not that everything was not
fair open and above-board it was so far
as any dry gulcher knew nevertheless
when pluto hung over the bar this neatly
lettered quotation from his favorite poet-

   heres a bottle and an honest friend

   what wad ye wish for mair man

-the doc was quick to paraphrase an epi-
taph by the same poet and scribble on a
placard below

    here lies old pluto-honest man

      cheat him devil-if you can

  then for he was in a bibulous and a
merry mood he borrowed a can of paint


argosy and railroad mans magazine

from foley and poising his brush over the
b burns sign outside the saloon changed
the letter  s  to  t

     b burnt is right conceded even the
staidest among the dry gulchers

iii

  doc yard smote his guitar and lifted his
voice in a quavering falsetto from the
opposite angle of the same window-seat
where curley q likewise nested on the
small of his back among the pillows came
the palpitant bleat of a ukulele in accom-
paniment

  neither tried to brighten the corner
where he was even the docs crisply
waxed mustache seemed to droop-blighted
by the lugubrious air wailing forth beneath
it

    we found his bones mid the prickly pears
   with the gold he left behind him

   hed got his and the crows got theirs-

   we laughed ho ho to find him

  he slurred into the chorus and the un-
couth refrain was taken up perfunctorily
and dolefully by the assembled dry gulch-
ers

   o-o-o-h-

   let ill winds blow if blow they must

   some miners dust for me-

   should the dust be gold for golds the dust
   i spend so glad and free

  there was neither  pep  nor grace to
these pseudo chorus men they did their
job lying down prone on navajo rugs or
draped over wicker chairs or leather-up-
holstered benches round the professors liv-
ing-hall after saturdays revelry at the
b burns they always saw clearly the spir-
itual and economic wisdom of a day of
complete rest

  they awaited the professor knowing
that in due season he would stir from his
audible slumbers in the adjoining room
in unvarying order he would bawl for his
bracing draft of forty-rod cuss classically
the imported chinee who would bear in
the cup and eat with undisguised relish
his imported breakfast herring and his por-
ridge some men would have shuddered at
the thought of food so early on sunday-
and did

  but as they watched the heat waves
shimmer through the room piping hot from
alkaline dust and volcanic rock their in-
creasing morbidness had scant connection
with the nauseating fumes of ting lings
cooking mandy swatt-squinting moodi-
ly through his slanting eyes and feebly
stroking his drooping mandarinlike mus-
tachios-touched drawlingly on a phase of
dry gulchs present problem

   this here mr jenks new official man-
ager for the b bums i calcoolate made
the usooal killin for pluto the fust satday
hes been on the job

  jenks was the fourth incumbent of the
managerial chair

  none of the morose miners had energy
or incentive to dispute this assertion the
doc began to twang tentatively on his gui-
tar when the mat curtaining the doorway
was thrust aside and the professor shuffled
into the room his grizzled beard kept him
well under cover although where his face
was cleared of whiskers there rose a bul-
bous nose-like a glowing crimson sun as
perceived through a thicket

  the professor sank into the armchair re-
served for him and these abrupt oracular
words rumbled out amid a dense cloud of
pipe-smoke

   men o dry gulch we have been toil-
ing many a year what have we to show
for it nothing and we shall have noth-
ing so long as we spend our all in that sink
of iniquity the b burns saloon and
casino

   this situation is by no means new i
mention it now only because we must do
something and that quickly theres no
use blinding ourselves to the fact that the
gold in the alluvial deposits which form our
claims is running thin when we shut up
shop will it be as bankrupts or as men
with fortunes in our belts  have a plan
to set before ye

   weve all prospected on both sides of
the river-bed but have found no trace of
gold despite this i have a feeling that
there must be some rich vein or mother
lode hereabouts i mentioned my belief
to the b burnss former manager and
curry suggested that we have a competent
mining engineer look the ground over
first national bank of faro

 

   should the mining expert discover fa-
vorable signs we could have him begin
operations his new activity woujjjpert
our minds from this vile gambling obses-
sion that is all we need it would en-
able us to amass fortunes even though the
experts operations should prove unsuccess-
ful yere all agreed i see to my plan

   our one salvation is to pour gold into
the hands of one of our number and see
that he gets away from town before he has
the chance to spend it he will endeavor
to meet the mining expert and make the fit
arrangements i may mention a mr john
truscott whose name curry gave me

   perhaps when our representative is
beyond reach of dry gulchs baneful influ-
ence he will have the eyes to see and the
will to do what can be done to reclaim us
from our evil ways but above all let us
act justly toward him the evil genius of
dry gulch may pursue him and prevail
against him and steal away the money
therefore we must not tie his hands the
money must lie made his to do with it as
the spirit moves him-

  this whole plan was so largely a gamble
that it fascinated the dry gulchers

  not a miner was missing when the band
gathered in the general store early the fol-
lowing saturday afternoon mose tuttle
self-appointed assistant to the professor
laid on the table a fresh poker deck for
each man the professor plunged straight
into the business at hand

   gentlemen he announced  we shall
now one and all cut for highest cards

  tabulated results showed that curley
q limpid brooks and tiny tim betts
had drawn aces

  the crowd surged excitedly toward the
table to watch the three cut again

  curley q exposed the queen of hearts
limpid brooks the king of spades and
tiny tim the ace of diamonds

   its yourn-an congratoolations are in
order cried mose officiously indicating
the sacks of precious dust which represent-
ed a weeks strenuous labor on the part of
the conscientious miners

  almost any man would be flustered if
five hundred thousand and a weighty re-
sponsibility were thrust upon him by the

turn of a card shifting his huge bulk
from one foot tolthe other tiny tim finally
responded in a hoarse voice

   gentlemen i wants to say as how i
appreciates this opportunity to help put
some sense in dry gulch an if there is
any way of givin you men any backbone
to buck this here b bums casino you can
count on tim to try his level best to do it

  several hands flew unconsciously to hol-
sters but suddenly remembering the occa-
sion the men fell in with the spirit of tims
good intentions and cheered him lustily

  as had been agreed upon tim paid fo-
ley dugan for enough provisions to last the
penniless miners during the coming week
toasts were drunk from private flasks
then tim and his gold were personally
conducted to the buckboard waiting in
front of dugans livery-stable before the
flustered miner could head as in habit
bound toward the b burns saloon

  cal cutty pony-express rider-more fa-
miliarly but unobtrusively referred to as
 calipers -mounted his bronco and sig-
nificantly tapped the guns that were to
guard tim and his treasure on the road to
tecopa

  a mighty chorus of  good luck ye ol
bald-headed son-of-a-gun welled from a
dozen brazen throats tiny tim smiled
mistily resolutely unbent his gaze from the
b bums saloon and was off

iv

  mose tuttle averred that theyd kissed
their coin good-by when-with a dozen
stout boots resting expectantly on the
polished brass rail-it was discovered that
tiny tim had not bequeathed them the
price of a single drink

   any galoot what would overlook a im-
portant thing like that an throw down his
pals cant be counted on maintained
mose darkly a dozen elbows leaned de-
jectedly on the mahogany bar and a like
number of heads wagged mournfully at the
evil omen

  tragedy was averted however mr
jenks never batted an eye as he said in a
hearty voice

    gentlemen dont let a little thing like
money stand between you and your favor-


argosy and railroad mans magazine

ite beverage your credits good at the b
burns till kingdom come this ones on
the house step right up gentlemen

  jenks proved himself a good host and
a nonchalant but attentive listener after
the dozen generously filled glasses were lift-
ed simultaneously for the sixth round
jenks was able to retire quietly to the grill
there he penned in code a terse report of
the days proceedings rousing indian
pete from his wickiup jenks despatched
him post-haste to tecopa with the message

  this third and most up-to-date report
of the dry gulchers recent doings was on
the wire relayed to san francisco and in
pluto macdonalds hands almost before
tiny tim in tecopa had finished rinsing
the alkali dust out of his throat with aged-
in-the-wood alcohol preparatory to entrain-
ing for the coast efficiency was jenkss
middle name

  days passed without word or sign from
tiny tim hope flickered then burned
to ashes  what can yuh expect of a
shorthorn who cant remember to set up a
drink mose reminded his comrades and
they could make no answer

  so another saturday came and dry
gulch lapsed into its former graceless es-
tate the hoyle club ran full blast the
roulette ball clicked merrily as ever in the
casino keno klondike and three-card
monte had their innings macdonald hu-
morously disguised as the goddess of
 chance accepted their devotions and all
their gold dust

  and the seventh was a day set aside as
usual for penitence doc guitar and uku-
lele wailed sobbed and bleated dolorously
until jerusalems  weeping wall  became
a rollicking cabaret when compared to the
professors bungalow with its penitential
congregation

  but on monday a dozen assorted con-
sciences actually did prick surprisingly
when tiny tim-smiling optimistic and a
wee bit cocky-suddenly reappeared

  there followed him from the buckboard
a tall lean individual distinguished by a
close-cropped vandyke and a quiet self-
contained manner

  tim introduced him simply as john
truscott as this internationally recognized

expert preferred to be known although
the miner in a confidential aside to the
professor whispered that truscott could
tag after his name if he wanted to ms
phd ce me che and so on
through the alphabet

  when truscott looked his eyes bored
right through you when he spoke men
jumped to do his bidding his crisp in-
cisive tones carried the ring of authority
and the power to command

  under his serious penetrating gaze the
dry gulchers felt that this was no time for
effusive greeting even mose tuttles or-
nate speech of welcome-ready as ever on
the tip of his facile tongue was swallowed
hastily in silence

  after a few pointed queries the mining
expert picked up his bag the professor
immediately placed his bungalow at their
guests disposal but truscott thanking
him replied that doubtless he would be
comfortable enough at the b burns of
which he had heard his tone while cour-
teous permitted of no argument

  their supper over the dry gulchers
gravitated toward the b burns and hung
around the bar at last inquiring casually
for mr truscott jenks reported how-
ever that truscott was  busy with pa-
pers and hardly would be down jenks
himself disappeared for the rest of the eve-
ning and left his bartender young dar-
row to do the honors

   sort of unsociable cuss-that trus-
cott observed the doc notwithstanding
which he and his comrades were inclined
to be more impressed than peevish

  next morning truscott inspected the
river-bed through the camp and beyond
scrutinized both banks and the adjoining
areas

  he devoted the afternoon to a second
and closer examination of the river-bed
and the western bank which rose precipit-
ously above it he repeatedly chipped off
fragments of the rock and the following
day he concentrated on the river-bed and
western bank at the northern extremity of
the camp

  indian pete made the rounds while the
dry gulchers were at supper and sum-
moned them to confer with truscott at the
first national bank of faro



b burns they found john truscott
standing behind a small table covered with
a sheaf of notes and penciled diagrams
without preamble he began

   dry gulchs source of gold is i am
convinced a gravel-bed of curiously limited
breadth and indeterminate length the
breadth fronts on dr yards claim-an
abnormally rich field from which perhaps
ages ago a swiftly running stream carried
and deposited the gold along the river-
course

   these river-bed deposits are almost ex-
hausted as you are aware the next logi-
cal point of attack is the length of the
gravel-bed which apparently extends west-
ward from the river traces of old on
the western bank at this frontage are clear-
ly defined of course this gravel-bed un-
derlies strata of hard volcanic rock at least
fifty feet deep hydraulic mining operat-
ing on the face of the cliff therefore is not
feasible it will be necessary to tunnel
under this volcanic rock on an approxi-
mate level with the river-bed drift min-
ing combined with sluicing is demanded

   i am willing to undertake the opening
of a drift and further development and
operation my affiliation with the western
mining development company - whose
representative i am here-places at my dis-
position the required machinery skilled la-
bor and all facilities

   in addition to my stipulated retaining-
fee mr betts has deposited with me cer-
tain funds to be applied to such operations
subject to your approval when these
funds were all utilized in the preparatory
work the western mining development
company would carry on the operations
under the following agreement

   their legal title to a half interest in
the mining claim and any profits derived
therefrom togethfr with your pledge to
defray half the current expenses such ex-
penses might be heavy and would have to
be met promptly on the other hand the
investment would seem decidedly promis-
ing in my advisory capacity i unhesita-
tingly urge it

   i would appreciate having your deci-
sion as soon as possible i leave to-mor-
row thank you with an abrupt stiff

bow john truscott gathered up his papers
and left the room

   what do yuh say we chew it over right
away volunteered betts  though i
think we could do it more comfortably at
the professors he added whereupon
they adjourned making a hurried exit past
the bar

  the business was transacted in short
order-as invariably was true when the
professor actually set his brain to working

   john truscott said he from the
depths of his easy-chair  evidently is a
man of knowledge and discernment mr
betts investigated his qualifications and
found him an authority his price is high
-some of ye might call his conditions
downright robbery-but brains and ef-
ficiency always do come high

   moreover our peculiar problem can
and should be solved by the diversion his
operations bring remember it is not a
question of his producing results from the
mining our present claims still are fruit-
ful enough if we give him as much as
one-half the money we ordinarily hand to
the b burns and save the other half our
fortunes are made

   men o dry gulch i am in strong fa-
vor of informing john truscott on the
morrow that we accept his proposal those
likewise in favor ofit will say  aye 

  sure responded the dry gulchers
without a dissenting voice

   then it is agreed the professor con-
firmed  we shall recompense mr betts
for his outlay of money -he coughed dif-
fidently- as soon as we are able for the
present we shall take a rising vote of thanks
to mr betts for his very good offices gen-
tlemen let us salute the savior of dry
gulch

  the willing dry gulchers bounded to
their feet and gave three cheers with a
tiger for good measure for tiny tim

   it was nothin at all-nothin at all
tiny tim protested in confusion  twas
dry gulchs money anyway not mine
cept fer a few reasonable incidentals in
the way of refreshments and sich i was
careful not to spend a penny of it

   ah shut up yuhve done a big thing
fer dry gulch mebbe an are too mule-

stubborn to own up to it growled mandy
swatt with that the miners hoisted tiny
tim to their shoulders and perspiringly
bore him in triumph to the b burns where
the whole party had a  night-cap -or
several

  the next morning john truscott calmly
received the news of their verdict and de-
parted for san francisco with the promise
that he would make immediate arrange-
ments to have the work begun

v

  curley q was the first to espy the cara-
van of mule-teams rolling across the desert
toward dry gulch several weeks later and
heralded its approach by a whoop that
brought every miner scuttling up the cliffs

  before nightfall there had sprung up a
camp of rough shacks and canvas with
drills and other machinery unloaded and
in process of setting up and a swarm of
huskies getting swiftly down to operations
truscott acted as director general but the
actual supervision of the men was delegated
to his assistant farrel a thick-set beetling-
biowed domineering person who was
everywhere bawling orders and seeing that
they were obeyed

  the professors hope that truscott and
his work would act as a wholesome diver-
sion in the community now seemed in a
fair way toward realization the dry
gulchers actually did forsake the casino

  then gravel rich in gold was uncovered
near the mouth of the drift this news
came as a tonic to the dry gulchers who
with river-bed claims daily lessening in
yield had been on the raw edge of worri-
ment temptation to celebrate this good
fortune was irresistible and the only ap-
propriate place for a celebration was the
b burns macdonald had no reason to
complain of his receipts these days

  suddenly everything went wrong there
was a break in the gold-bearing gravel-bed
truscott determined to tunnel straight
ahead but day after day virtually no gold
assayed from the gravel uncovered final-
ly he gave orders to extend the drift no
farther instead to proceed from the break
and start new tunnels off at various angles

adding to the dry gulchers misfortunes

was the exhaustion of their river-bed claims
to a point where as the doc put it  you
had to work like a sand-hog to make a bare
living

  fagged out each day and utterly dis-
couraged they naturally resorted to the
b burns for stimulant in this condition
of lowered physical and mental vitality it
was but a step from  cheering up  to
recklessness-and thence to the gambling-
tables the stakes now were pitifully small
still the urbane jenks always was there
with comforting predictions for a speedy
change of luck he went so far as to ad-
vance moderate loans on their ious

  their  jinx  already was matched
against them-wearing them down-spar-
ring for the opportunity to land the final
blows to their ambitions the blows fell
soon and swiftly

  until recently the miners always had
paid foley promptly for everything late-
ly with luck dead against them they had
been running up little bills foley had
been happy to accommodate them but
this saturday when their gold dust weighed
at the general store proved insufficient for
their needs the little irishman seemed
frankly distressed

   im sorry boys at last he blurted
out  but i cant extend any more credit
truth is ive only got money enough to
keep my business going and pay for the
regular supplies you know where my
profits go- pointing significantly toward
the b burns  guess were all in the
same pickle he sighed ruefully

  foley had turned them down they
felt stunned-bewildered

  they drifted over to b burns one
glance at jenkss glum face warned them
of another blow impending it fell

   gentlemen murmured jenks  im
sorry to say my principal has instructed me
to sell drinks only for spot cash and to
close the casino as it is ive got in bad
with the boss i spose he wires me to
report at san francisco and leave darrow
here in temporary charge

  nothing seemed to matter after that
they received with callous indifference
farrels peremptory invitation for them to
meet him at the b burns on monday


first national

  at this conference the engineers first
words were reassuring  were now on
the right track he said  indications
are that our last drift has located a rich
field of gold-bearing gravel

  but this auspicious introduction was
merely the feint that covered a knock-out
blow

   its a question now of funds farrel
went on  not only have we expended
your contribution but for many weeks we
have been bearing the entire costs the
company advises me in mr truscotts ab-
sence that we must have at least twenty-
five thousand dollars from you at once
he paused for reply

   we aint got nothin-yuh cant take
blood from a stone tim betts muttered
finally	

   then pronounced farrel icily  i
cant see anything else but for you to assign
your interests to the company the de-
velopment is likely to be productive now
but there is no telling how long it will con-
tinue profitable if we are going to take
all the risks we want all the profits

  the professor requested a moment to
discuss the matter among themselves
when farrel had stepped outside the min-
ers looked hopelessly at one another

  the professor frowned his pessimism

 we might invoke the law because of the
short notice they have given us in which to
raise funds or we might secure financial
backing on the strength of cur prospects
or we might force a new organization--
and obtain capital through stock subscrip-
tions

   but how can we do anything without a
little ready cash among us all there isnt
enough money to defray the expenses of a
man to the coast-to put up a proper front
and make a successful dicker

    i guess this does finish us betts sadly
agreed he gulped hard  only sorry 
got you fellers into this he said

   it was not your fault tim the pro-
fessor broke in roughly  weve simply
played our last card-and it turns out a
deuce our trouble has been weve played
too many cards in plain words weve
made damn fools of ourselves

   since were dead ones we might as

bank of faro	

              

well get the obsequies over remarked the
doc with grim cheerfulness at a nod
from the professor he walked to the door
and called farrel

    its yours rasped the professor

  the engineer smiled his cool satisfac-
tion  thats settled he commented in
a tone less brutal

   mr truscott gave me instructions in
such event he thought he might be able
to salvage something for you out of the
wreck-some small interest in the mine
perhaps it will be necessary for you to
go to san francisco to sign certain papers
and arrange certain formalities this mem-
orandum shows the place and day for the
appointment he also instructed me to
advance this sum for your traveling ex-
penses

  dropping the memorandum and a bulky
roll of currency on the table farrel disap-
peared before the miners could catch their
breath

  we dont want their dirty money
shouted mandy swatt first to recover
 they beat us were sports enough to
quit the game without hollerin fer a hand-
out

   dont be hasty man the professor
admonished his brow in a thoughtful puck-
er  there may be something behind this
for all that john truscott was a clam so
far as conversation with us went i think
he felt kindly disposed toward us

   why not meet him half-way some of
us are not as young as we once were if
we can save a few pennies out of this mess
-and still maintain what little self-respect
wre have-i say by all means let us do it

   truscott was a decent fellow i must
say tiny tim coincided  mebbe he is
a better friend than we realize

  so the dry gulchers determined to see
it through

vi

  packing up was simple it only meant
putting a few necessary garments into an-
cient valises-and walking out not even
a key to turn in a lock-where no doors
ever had been locked

  moved by common impulse the miners
trotted with their bags over to the profes-


argosy and railroad mans magazine

sors bungalow they heard ting ling
shuffling behind the curtained doorway and
his occasional lisping singsong words-
indications that the professor was break-
fasting

  asthe men quietly assumed their accus-
tomed positions the professors gruff voice
came to them

   where are you going boy

  ting ling answered in a subdued falset-
to  me go long mist fallel me solly
no go long you plofesso	

  a momentary silence then the professor
cleared his throat savagely there was a
clatter of knife and fork the scraping of a
chair pushed back and an angry grunt

   somethings the matter with the
damned herring this morning

  the curtain was shoved aside and the
professor growled a short  good morning
ting ling helped him out of the dressing-
gown and into a frock coat of uncertain
period the professor took his top hat
from the chinaman in return thrusting
into ting lings astonishingly reluctant
hand what looked like a roll of bank-notes

  the dry gulchers faces set filed over
to dugans livery and climbed into the
waiting buckboards foley dugan himself
shambled down the steps from the store
 thought id go along as far as tecopa
he vouchsafed

   wholl take care of the store foley
dully remonstrated mandy

   oh sam can tend to things for a day
-or them development fellows can help
themselves foley answered listlessly

  there was the pulsating hum and rattle
of machinery and the smoke of stationary
engines over at the drift-the men working
as usual but iarrel came to the edge of
town to wave a good-by to the dry gulch-
ers amusement pity and a little of con-
tempt were artfully blended in his parting
smile

   say professor let me plug im jest
once pleaded the impulsive jackrogers
but the professor his lips compressed in a
wry smile put forth a detaining hand
with one accord the men swept their town
of dry gulch with a lingering hungry gaze
-then turned faces stonily to the desert
before them

  deeper bitterer silence never brooded
over a party of men leaving a drab desert
town to seek the lights of a city each was
absorbed with his ov-n reflections-and
they were not pleasant

  six men there were among them who re-
membered too well how they had staggered
out of death valley and come with the
glad hurrah of discoverers into this land of
gold and fortune life luxuries riches
ambitions-all had been theirs to com-
mand now they were outcasts from the
camp they had founded and the fortune
had vanished with their hopes they
cursed their own weaknesses-truly but
in the breast of every man-the six pio-
neers and their fellows-there blazed a con-
suming hatred of macdonald as the malev-
olent cause of their downfall they held
a grievous score to settle

  even the farewell imbibings with foley
at the prairie dog in tecopa failed to re-
vive their drooping spirits the function
had all the appearance of a gloomy high
executioner toasting the health of his pros-
pective victims

   hope you make out all right foley
old pal said doc with what cheerfulness
he could muster as the train pulled in and
foley dugan shook hands all around

   me returned foley in a hollow voice
 i shut up my store soon as i get back
they aint no dry gulch for me with you
fellers out of it

vii

  many a curious passer-by paused at the
intersection of certain streets in san fran-
cisco early this sultry afternoon

  the professors rusty frock coat and an-
cient topper docs immaculate cutaway
of the same vintage and the other miners
in attire reminiscent of the forty-niners
in themselves courted attention

  but what chiefly held the speculative eye
of onlookers was the animation and earnest-
ness pervading this strange group

    this aint nowise like the other offices
of the western mining development com-
pany i was in tiny tim was insisting
obstinately

  mandy swatt pointed an impatient fin-
ger at a penciled memorandum  here
first national bank of faro



  yuh kin see the address with yer own eyes
an if these aint the streets an this the
southwest corner i aint no judge of signs
of directions

   but to all intents and purposes this
edifice is a bank demurred the professor

    oh lets try it anyway doc reckless-
ly cut in

  the professor arbitrarily herded the min-
ers through thedoor of the imposing build-
ing their arrival was announced by the
fierce hoorays of irreverent newsies outside
who evidently were looking forward to a
hold-up of the cashier looting and gun-
play safely inside the professor inquired
for mr john truscott

  the elegantly uniformed functionary re-
plied without surprise or hesitation  right
this way gentlemen if you please mr
truscott is expecting you

  they were trailing their guide awkward-
ly in close file when jack rogers gave a
startled exclamation and halted so sudden-
ly that mandy swatt marched up his shins
the miners ahead turned sharply follow-
ing jacks frozen stare all saw grinning at
them from the receiving tellers cage-joe
brennan a former bartender at the b
burns

  dumfounded they moved forward-
only to be greeted from the paving-tellers
cage by smiling charlie cruse also former
bartender

  after this the sight of jenks working
busily in the cashiers sacred cubby-hole
and a glimpse through an open office door
of mr curry graciously shaking hands
with a personage who must be at least a
multimillionaire could not surprise them
into as much as the flicker of an eyelid

   what sort of a dump is this anyhow
demanded mandy swatt huskily

   what is the name of pluto macdon-
alds bank doc countered through
clenched teeth

   jumpin jinrikisha gasped tiny tim
 i do believe this here is it

  thirteen troubled miners looked at
one another at first questioningly then
sternly their jaws squared if pluto
macdonald was to be seen they had some-
thing important to say to him before they
went away

  the attendant led them through a spa-
cious handsomely appointed reception-
room he gave a peculiar knock at a
 private  door opposite then ushered
them in

  they were met by the short nod and
keen gray eyes of a powerfully built man
seated at a large flat-topped desk in the
center of the room six of the miners knew
him well he was macdonald

  john truscott rose from a chair beside
the financier and greeted the dry gulchers
with an encouraging smile macdonald re-
mained motionless

  the six pioneers had time only to note
that macdonalds impassive features had
been scored with new lines and his hair
grayed heavily then they were ranged
like schoolboys on a double row of chairs
at the far side of the room

  every man of the six seethed at what
appeared a studied humiliation yet
strangely they could make no articulate
protest the spell of the old macdonald-
whose command they had obeyed without
question-gripped them against their will
they quivered as the cold even tones of
macdonalds deep authoritative voice shat-
tered the tense silence

   so mr truscott intimated that you
might hope for a little something from the
western mining development company
after surrendering your claims did he
well i am practically that company

  he made deliberate pause-then with
cool impersonal detachment

   i candidly do not know what advan-
tage money would be to a pack of fools
who have been easy-marks all their lives
jack rogers-who in time past would
have died for macdonald-snarled and
reached like a flash for his concealed gun
easy lad easy cautioned mandy
swatt quick to forestall the crazed young
miners desperate intention disregarding
the scuffle macdonald continued impla-
cably

   gold-an untold fortune-right in
your fists a chance to use your brains and
abilities to serve some useful purpose in
life and you let it slip right through your
fingers your existence dedicated to rif-
fling bits of pasteboard and pouring alcohol

down your gullets no wonder anybody
could pick your pockets

   do you realize that the money youve
staked and lost on a little ball spinning on
a fool wheel has provided for over three
years the capital for this banking institu-
tion and the financing of several industries
even a child burnt once learns its lesson
macdonalds frigid dispassionate utter-
ance stung like a whip-lash-cut to the
raw the miners eyes burned with hatred
lips twisted impotently breaths came in
convulsive gasps

  truscott had turned toward the window
the tormentor went on

   you probably accuse me of robbing
you well why shouldnt i have it before
the other fellow you couldnt have kept
it

suppose i did deliberately build the

b	burns with the intention of taking your
money suppose i did establish dugan
to keep you contented with toys and trifles
during the operation

  foley dugan their pal-a creature of
pluto macdonald the dry gulchers
stared in a daze until comprehension finally
thrust wickedly and deep into their hearts

   no you scarcely could be expected to
see through that little trick of mine or a
freeze-out by my development company
when you were so simple-minded as to
drop all your money at roulette week after
week-regularly as clockwork-and never
even make sure whether or not the wheel
was crooked

  human endurance had reached its break-
ing-point with wild incoherent cries of
rage the miners leaped to their feet they
got no farther rising suddenly macdon-
ald leaned forward and hurled at them in
clear blasting tones

   you call yourselves men-you who
must have a nurse to see that you stow
your pennies in your little bank

   thank your lucky stars some one took
an interest in you or to-day youd be
without a cent-instead  being the
wealthiest men in san francisco

  the miners sank back stiffly into their
chairs and eyes popping out at macdon-
ald and mouths agape sat as inflexible as
immovable as a grove in the petrified forest

  macdonald too resumed his seat yet
ft was not pluto macdonald the six pioneers
beheld a transformation had taken place
tom macdonald sat before them-the old
macdonald of the shrewd yet kindly eye
and the dry whimsical smile

viii

  pivoting his chair macdonald gazed
absently out the tall sunlit window his
voice now warm and human and sympa-
thetic slipped into reminiscence

   about four years ago seven men went
prospecting into lost valley some people
called it dam-fool recklessness but i guess
it would have been just plain suicide for all
seven if i hadnt had the pick of the grit-
tiest and squarest men on the coast they
were the professor mandy swatt tim
betts the doc mose tuttle and a young
fire-eater named jack rogers-in years the
 baby  of the party but as game as men
come

   folks declared it couldnt be done
men who claimed to know said that the
sun focused through a burning-glass on
this god-forsaken waste that it dried up
the blood in your veins sucked the marrow
from your bones and left your scorched
skeleton for the dust whirls to play with
and the sandstorms to cover up they
were pretty nearly right

   but there was one thing the accursed
desert couldnt conquer-the nerve of my
six pardners that pulled us through lost
valley and dragged us out of death valley
-men more dead than alive

   if ever men deserved to handle and
hold the treasure we discovered at dry
gulch those men did however we all
have our little failings and my pardners
never had been able to steer clear of gam-
bling

   i soon saw how it would end one by
one they would recklessly quit their claims
wander from dry gulch with their  pile
and gamble away their fortune to the last
cent i always would have enough for
everybody but i knew they would be too
bull-headed to accept what they would call
 charity

   the only alternative i could think of
was to save their money for them
first national bank of faro



   so i planned the b burns-actually
as a branch of this bank the b burns
indeed was so important a part of our
financial scheme here that a man had to be
bartender-and receiving teller-at the b
burns before he could become receiving
teller here and a man had to prove his
executive ability as manager of the b
burns in order to win an important execu-
tive position in this bank

   it really was splendid training for the
 first national bank of faro -thats
what the boys jokingly called it-always
did a rushing business the ability to mix
even a cocktail or to act as banker or crou-
pier in the casino didnt hurt them they
all are teetotalers and dont gamble

   the depositors at the b burns  bank 
of course were my six pardners and the
men they took into dry gulch-who natu-
rally became my pardners also the ac-
counts were handled according to the
method i shall describe

   the bartender initialed each bar check
with the name of the purchaser and kept
accurate record of his total monthly pur-
chases in the casino it unfortunately was
impossible to record the original deposit
that each man brought into the place be-
cause the money changed hands so often
during the evening so it had to be assumed
that the patrons each made total monthly
deposits there of an equal sum

   at the end of the month all moneys re-
ceived by the b burns bank were com-
puted from this total amount i deducted
-and placed to my personal credit-in-
terest on my investment in the b burns
and a reasonable profit on the bar sales
deduction also was made of sums spent in
overhead and operating costs

   the residue might be called dry
gulchs gross investment this was ap-
portioned into equal shares from each
mans share was deducted the sum total of
his bar purchases the amount remaining
was recorded as his monthly deposit and
so entered on the books here in san fran-
cisco

   all money thus deposited i have in-
vested in worthy securities and enterprises
and have credited each depositor with a
just interest the aggregate of these de-

posits with interest compounded now rep-
resents for each man what might well be
regarded a staggering fortune

  macdonalds eyes lost their momentary
twinkle and he passed his hand wearily
across his forehead as though to brush
away unpleasant memories the men of
dry gulch still sat spellbound

   it has not always been easy for me
he said simply  my old pardners were
in dry gulch-men who had stood by me
through thick and thin i might say that
i was very very fond of them and i
wanted to see them a good many times
during the past years i have been tempted
to go to dry gulch and square myself and
give the whole thing away

   but i felt that my pardners must learn
their lesson before my plan could do them
any permanent good

   i believe the western mining develop-
ment deal has served that purpose my
friend truscott helped me put it through
although my original idea was to have
these mining interests represented in stock
held by the men of dry gulch and myself
-share and share alike-i feel that john
truscott also deserves a share these
shares promise to be of extraordinary value
before the mine peters out

   finally my plan is to act as trustee for
the men of dry gulch holding their money
in trust until each man is established in
some congenial vocation

   these great fortunes bring a response
bility which i feel that every man will ac-
cept theres not one among you without
the brains to put this money to proper use

   the professors text-books on biology
still are used in half a dozen universities
doc was one of the most promising young
physicians in baltimore before he hit the
toboggan mandy knows cattle from a to
z tuttle is at home in manufacturing-
youve all got buried talents ready to dig
up and employ ive faith in every one of
you

  swinging slowly to front the miners
macdonald searched their faces long and
earnestly and hungrily

   boys he appealed softly  maybe
ive been just a cussed meddler in your
lives perhaps it is i who am in need of a


argosy and railroad mans magazine

cruelly severe lesson but i want you to
believe that i meant it for the best and
if you can id like you to forgive me for
the suffering ive caused you

  blinking uncertainly and stirring with
the utmost caution as though fearful of
waking from an impossibly splendid dream
the dazed dry gulchers felt-rather than
saw-some one rise from a chair it was
the professor

  shamelessly mopping his eyes with a
bandanna kerchief he stumbled toward the
desk and clutched in a mighty grasp the
hand swiftly outstretched to meet his

   tom macdonald-tom macdonald-
he choked- yere white-clean white-all
through

   youve no right to take the hand of a
cur whos done nothing but slander ye
but just the same praise god it means
more to me than anything else in the world
-tom macdonald old friend

  whefeupon dry gulch found its feet-
and voice

   three rip-roaring cheers for tom mac-
donald yelled the doc as he led the wild
rush that engulfed the bank president

   good old mac good old mac good
old mac the cheers rose in a tumult of
sound that rang and echoed through every
hall and corridor

   visitors to this eminently respectable in-
stitution were mystified and shocked at this
extraordinary rude outburst

  but jenks and curry-and many others
of the bank-chuckled aloud slapped their
thighs in a most undignified manner and
donned a grin that would not come off
they knew

  mr betts had warmed to his tale and
proceeded smoothly enough until the action
would thrust him into the lime-light then
he would empty his glass or refill it ab-
sently skip a chapter and go on glibly with
the next leaving me to pick up many loose
threads my curiosity was unsatisfied on
many points some of these i questioned
him about

   how did macdonalds plan eventually
turn out i impertinently wanted to know

    we couldnt act like quitters after what
macdonald had done for us could we he

responded in gentle amazement  we all
became reliable responsible citizens-i
guess with no more vices than average hu-
mans

   macdonald soon turned over all our
money to us the professor has a chair
in an eastern university here and spends
a lot of time and money outfitting scientific
expeditions that go all over the world the
doc is active head of his own foundation
for medical research-a -wizard they say he
is now mandy swatt and curley q are
partners and cajtle kings mose tuttle is
a big manufacturer-mixes in politics too
ive heard everybody seems to bedoing
ricely

   ive a good-sized lumber business-
keep outdoors away from the office as
much as i can doing a few stunts in ship-
building on the pacific coast too just
been to washington about it

   the first national bank of faro
seems to have done a great deal for the
men of dry gulch what may i ask has
it done for macdonald i queried finally

  mr betts shook his head dismally  a
mighty poor investment for macdonald
im afraid hed had no kith or kin of his
own-an hed spent his energies lookin
after us when this responsibility was
over he thought hed sort of relax and take
the vacation he needed

   so he gave up active business for a
while and turned his affairs over to a bright
young chap he had confidence in-the first
bad misjudgment hed ever made of a man
the young feller panned out a born gam-
bler-took all kinds of raw chances mac-
donalds eggs were in a good many baskets
hed enjoyed being interested in lots of en-
terprises-a sort of outlet for his tremen-
dous energies i spose and this young
feller started to spill one basket after an-
other macdonald had been taken down
sick and had to keep to his bed for a time

   before mac could get up and about
an find out what was goin on he was
pretty nigh cleaned out then bad luck
kept followin him up the last smash-
just a short time ago-left him practically
bankrupt limpy brooks heard of it first
and rushed in to tide the old man over
then limpy wrote the professor in full
the miracle



  he diffidently drew a telegram from his
pocket and smoothed it out carefully
 yuh might be intrested in this the
professor sent one to every dry gulcher
soon as he got limpys letter

  the telegram had been despatched from
boston and read

dry gulchers meet san francisco twentieth
next month pluto unfortunate come pre-
pared transfer all assets to pluto trustee

                                  professor

  challenged by my look of bold inquiry
mr betts explained in some confusion

the

    you see once macdonald is trustee in
 charge of all our money again it  give
 im something to think about - an hell
 soon be his old self again anyway it
 never was our money whatever he might
 say rights right

   i laughed mockingly

    jack rogers took the first boat from
 france said mr betts irrelevantly his
 embarrassed eyes avoiding mine  an im
 just waitin here to go west with im if he
 gets safe through them blooming subma-

for hours we had ridden across deso-
late champagne our horses picking
their way over the pockmarked terrane
littered with the incredible debris of a race
of degenerates possessing the strength of
men coupled with the wanton destructive-
ness of children

 the heat of afternoon gave way to the
cool breath of evening the sun set in a
fantastic smear of crimson and gold and
the more brilliant stars crept forth from a
dome of lapis lazuli presently the moon
at the full rose in almost artificial splendor
back home they were speaking of it as the
 harvest moon here the only harvest
was that of death desolation and despair

  seen beneath its amber light the picture
changed from a landscape in brilliant oils
to an etching in monstrous blacks and
whites it was as if we were crossing the
ghostly contour of some dead planet the
battle line stilled by the armistice was

well beyond-the returning tide of scat-
tered inhabitants far to the rear we were
alone in a land at once empty and silent

  here and there an object caught my eye
and i guided my mount aside to identify it
once it was the sparkle of moonshine from
the staring eyes of a doll again it was a
crucifix the wooden figure hacked and de-
filed a broken iron pot lay beside a
fifteenth-century missal painfully trans-
cribed and illuminated by some forgotten
monk during slow creeping years a tom
placard affixed to a wall announced a boche
beer-drinking contest beside it was the
impaled body of a kitten-a mere scrap of
moldering fur

  oftener there was nothing identifiable
houses had been wrecked and leveled and
then seemingly brayed in giant mortars
that there might remain nothing save dust
to be blown away by the wind and worked
up into mud by the rain - to disappear


argosy and railroad mans magazine

utterly from the face of the earth and the
very memories of men

  we rode in silence for the most part
lieutenant paradis and i depressed by the
bleak and artificial desert created by man
in one of the garden spots of europe

  it was then a weird and startling sight
which suddenly materialized before our eyes
from the fog-wraiths which clung to a wind-
ing river-nothing less than a perfectly pre-
served little town in the midst of all the
woful wreckage

  not absolutely untouched of course
looking sharp one observed where a corner
of the church belfry had gone and here
and there a gaping hole where a home had
stood but practically intact even the
stained-glass in the church and most of the
humble panes of its shops unbroken

  here it stood as if left for a solitary
specimen of the vanished villages of cham-
pagne

  if any such purpose had spared it one
could have wished that some other town
might have been chosen in its place-for
breaux was unknown to the tourist it pos-
sessed no famous edifice no supreme ex-
ample of medieval craftsmanship

  still marvelously sweet it looked sleep-
ing amid its filmy draperies of vapor be-
neath the full mooh with its one principal
street widening to a civic center where stood
the church the two inns the town hall and
on whose cobbled pave had for centuries
raged no battle fiercer than that of its bare-
headed wooden-shod market women over
the prices of fat geese and luscious grapes

  it was silent and deserted as our tired
horses clumped through it i noted espe-
cially a little wine-shop with the symbolic
dry bush still in its place over the door its
square bottles still in orderly array upon
the shelf behind the copper counter

  that the boches should have spared the
church and the tavern answered all queries
as to the condition of the other buildings
breaux had been spared but why

  we passed abruptly from it to open
country as one does in france with no
tailing off such as our suburbs reveal the
town ended as if cut off with a giants
knife a little way beyond i turned in my
saddle for a parting glance

  breaux stood between us and the moon
now and its nearly horizontal beams strik-
ing through the windows and portals it
was as if the entire village was ablaze for
some silent and ghostly festival some voice-
less triumph

  lieutenant paradis answered the ques-
tion in my eyes speaking for the first time
in hours

  it is the town which was saved by
miracle he said  by the colonel eugen
etienne ste marie de voulx late of na-
poleons young guard who rose from the
dead to preserve the home of his ancestors
 a miracle i responded vaguely
 ah-yes like the angel of mons and the
christ seen at night upon the battle-fields
easing the souls of dying men

  for some moments paradis did not
speak and when he did it was not to refer
at once and directly to the miracle of
breaux

   concerning these things who knows
not i i neither believe nor disbelieve
but always in world crises these reports
are current it was so when greeks fought
trojans and do you recall that when the
turks took constantinople the wretched
people sought refuge in their cathedral and
as the enemy burst in upon them there and
began slaughtering young and old women
and children the priest who was in the
midst of celebrating mass bore the sacred
elements out through a little door in the
apse and the turks sealed it up and so it
has remained unto this day in the mosque
of ste sophia

   and it is said that on the day when it
shall be reconsecrated as a christian church
the little door shall open and the celebrant
come forth and resume the canon of the
mass at the point where it was so bloodily
interrupted centuries ago

  we crossed the brook by a ford since
its bridge had been blown up and as we
clambered up the bank paradis continued
 so in our own war men say that on a
certain night when a gap was torn in our
lines a ragged hole open to calais and
there were no more troops to thrw in there
rose silently from the mists strange men in
great bearskin shakos wearing obsolete
bandoliers and carrying clumsy muskets
the miracle



    at their head upon a gray horse rode
a gray figure bowed forward in thought
one hand thrust into his breast a cocked
hat upon his head it was to be sure the
little corporal risen from the dead to
hurl his grizzled old guard upon the dese-
crators of french soil

   at any rate the gap was stopped no-
body knows how or by whom a division
rushed up by lorries found no one friend
or foe when they arrived at dawn-only
the waves of dead men as the tide had
ebbed and flowed myself i believe that
when mankind is in travail an anguish too
great to be borne alone it flies to deity as
a child to its mothers skirt or as chicks to
the maternal wing

   it is inconceivable intolerable that
god should look down a mere spectator
upon their agony as from a celestial grand-
stand and so there are portents in the
sky and gods fighting with men and
legends passing from one to another the
children of hope and fear

   merely legends i asked

  lieutenant paradis shrugged

   who can say let me repeat what a
great philosopher has written that with so
many hundreds of thousands of lusty young
souls cut off instantly and in the full sway
of the most violent passions it is incon-
ceivable that they should at once go to
their abiding place rather must the earth
be girdled by a stratum of spiritual unrest
reacting upon our minds in many singular
and mysterious ways

  under the waning stars and to the
solemn accompaniment of the slow-coming
dawn paradis related to me the miracle
whereby de voulx though long asleepin
bis coffin returned to save the village of
his forebears from the slime of the green-
gray german horde

  three men sat about a little table in the
sacristy of the old parish church of st leu
m breaux it was early fall the third year
of the great war and save for these three
there remained no living inhabitant in the
town all had departed bearing with them
such valuables as could be gathered up
before the german onrush

  for days the unfortunates from scores
     argosy

of similar villages to the eastward had
streamed through breaux pausing long
enough to rest for an hour and to whisper
or the unspeakable wo that had overtaken
their homes

  breaux was an ancient town but one
never looming large in the pages of history
its one seignorial family that of de voulx
had produced no scions of the first rank
they had been provincial lordlings step-
ping high upon the cobbled streets of the
town dominated by their rambling chateau
but seeming ill at ease whenever they on
rare occasions journeyed to versailles

  by and large they had dealt wisely and
kindly with their tenants and retainers
one of them had saved the town from sack
during the spanish wars tradition had it
that the very earliest of the name had
beaten back the marauding bands of
teutons

  the last of his line colonel eugen one-
time commander of xapoleons young
guard seems to have been a pompous
fussy little man of no particular ability
but unquestioned courage he was consid-
ered to bear some slight resemblance to the
great commander himself a likeness he did
nothing to minimize by his dress carriage
and demeanor

  he died in breaux upon returning from
the siege of acre and in his last delirium
had risen in his bed and remarked in his
most characteristic manner that if ever
breaux were in danger of capture they had
but to open his sepulchre and he would
come forth and save the town even as the
de voulx overlords had ever preserved it
inviolate

  whereupon he fittingly died without
spoiling his utterance by an anticlimax
and he lay in a leaden -coffin in the vault
of st leu beneath the feet of the three
solitary citizens of breaux who were in
fact discussing him in the sacristy lighted
by a pair of great altar candles

  the cure father jean had remained to
secure the jeweled ciborium containing the
consecrated host and the parish register
together with such portable relics as he
could save across from him sat ai pel-
letier a heavy red-faced man with beard
cut square like a spade and who as mayor


argosy and railroad mans magazine

had busied himself securing certain of the
town records

  the third was of peasant type with a
face cross-hatched with innumerable lines
indicative of honesty shrewdness and
obstinacy in equal proportions

  it was he the grandson of the orderly of
the late colonel de voulx who was address-
ing the other two the big men of his little
world whom he sought to coerce with his
dogged persistence accompanied by many
shrugs outthrustings of palms elevating of
brows and clicks of his tongue against the
roof of his toothless mouth

    it is i who tell you mon pare and you
monsieur le maire i who had the story
from my grandsire whom the blessed sairts
have in their keeping and after him
from my father also a pious christian it
has been kept in our family as a sacred
trust pardieu for just such an occasion
as this messieurs for as he lay dying
his soul already straining at the halter if
you will permit the saying mon pare-

  the aged priest raised his hand both
he and pelletier and indeed every one in
breaux down to the gamins who played
about its one street knew the story by
heart

   the minds of dying men wander in
blind paths my son if i were to consider
all the pitiful last words to which i have
listened here in our parish during the last
half century-

  the old man interrupted him impatiently

   of a surety my own blessed father
called for his pipe-and he had not used
tobacco for twenty years but one is to
distinguish between the babbling of a sim-
ple peasant and the inspired prophecy of a
great one like a de voulx whose ancestors
have preserved this our town since history
was written

  father jean smiled faintly

   pierre my son it is not meet that we
should violate the grave of one given
sepulture according to the rites of the
church merely to disprove an old wives
tale

  pierre fairly sputtered with indignation
and ere he could find his tongue again the
third man the mayor pelletier opened his
firm lips for the first time

   you know begging your pardon mon--
sieur le cure for whom i have only love and
respect and you friend pierre that i am
an atheist religion harms no one-and
doubtless consoles old women as for me
when i die you may serve me as you will

i am dead for all time-as dead as my
faithful old dog bidou and less worthy of
immortailty

   no more than i believe in father
jeans rites do i credit good pierres
miracles we do wrong to waste time here
we are custodians of town property at
any moment the huns may clatter down
our street i havent the least superstitious
fear against opening our eminent towns-
mans leaden casket-but i see no sense in
taking time to do so

  pierre waved his knotted hands fran-
tically

   name oj a name oj god you dont
see and you dont believe and you this and
that how could colonel de voulx with
his last breath bid us commit a sacrilege
upon himself and he a good christian
shriven by the pious pere hyacinthe your
predecessor my father and you mon-
sieur why waste in empty words time
enough to open his coffin twice over see 

  pierre drew from his blouse a keen adz
and brandished it

   it is made sharp for biting into the
lead if indeed colonel de voulx spoke
idly no harm can come of it do not the
thrice accursed boches open every sealed
coffin of the blessed dead seeking for
jewels and think you they will spare this
one

  father jean glanced half-humorously
half-sadly into the steady eyes of pelletier
and shrugged helplessly the latter spoke

    there are no miracles there never
were but there are always facts and one
of them is this the german cavalry will
snap us up like trout while we argue here
and with us the records and that jeweled
gewgaw you value so highly pere jean

  pierre rallied for his final argument he
controlled his excitement with a violent
effort

   listen then it is true that you have
heard my story many times it is true
that every breeched lad in breaux knows
the miracle



il by heart and i pierre tell you they
also believe it and when they shall re-
turn some day and fumbling amid the
ashes and broken glass shall seek to trace
that place where once burned their hearth
fires think you they shall not say  if only
pere jean and that donkey of a pelletier
and old doddering pierre had but sum-
moned forth colonel de voulx from his
tomb breaux would have been saved 

  he leaned back the breath whistling be-
tween his grinning lips his shrewd puck-
crcd old eyes bright and black still tri-
umphantly seeking theirs

  abruptly the priest rose taking one of
the candles in his hand

   come  he said  the thing shall be
done that my poor people may know that
our thought was for them and their fire-
sides even if that thought be impious
which the good god forbid

  pelletier said no more but accompanied
by pierre bearing his adz followed the
priest through a little door down a narrow
stone stair into the crypt of the old church
beneath the altar

  here slept the few notables of breaux
a long line of de voulxs the departed in-
cumbents of the parish of st leu a locally
famous avocal half a dozen others deemed
worthy of internment here conspicuous
among them the great casket of colonel
eugen etienne ste marie de voulx the
soft lead deep bitten by a die of the na-
poleonic bee many times repeated and one
terse line beneath his name  of the
young guard 

  the place was cool and dry and the
home of many shadows pursued hither and
thither as the great candle held by pere
jean moved in his nervous grasp

  wasting no time for there was none to
be wasted old pierre swung his keen adz
surely and it sank into the lead casing
matching each succeeding cut with the
skill of a forester he proceeded entirely
around the casket and in a surprisingly
short time motioned to the others that he
had finished the first part of his task-
whereupon they jointly and with difficulty
eased the heavy lid to the floor under-
neath was discovered a perfectly sound oak
coffin

   from this too but without removing it
 from the outer casing pierre pried off the
 top-and behold before them lay the
 late colonel of the young guard in a sur-
 prisingly good state of preservation al-
 though his face was swollen and nearly
 biack still one might trace a hint of the
 likeness to the great napoleon so sed-
 ulously cultivated by the old soldier

   he was dressed in full uniform blue
 swallow-tailed coat with broad revers and
 tarnished brass buttons and epaulets gloved
 hands crossed over lis sheathed sword
 cocked hat by his side long-spurred cavalry
 boots upon his bandy legs a row of medals
 was strung across his breast

   the three men stared at him in breath-
 less silence the cure and pierre crossed
 themselves pelletier gravely touched his
 forehead in respectful salute whatever
 their various ideas in one particular they
 felt alike here before them visible to the
 naked eye lay one of the officers of a fa-
 mous and unbeaten regiment of the great
 military genius of their beloved country

   so absorbed were they pierre with his
 hopes father jean with his apprehensions
 the mayor with his respectful interest that
 they failed to hear upon the cobbled street
 above them the faint clatter of the advance
 force of uhlans riding cautiously into
 - breaux failed to hear them as having dis-
 mounted they followed the tiny candle
 gleam down into the crypt and were
 shocked into a numb terror only when the
 captain of uhlans in excellent french ad-
 dressed them mockingly as he advanced
 through the stairway door

    so it is that frenchmen rifle the
 graves of their own dead that they may
 afterward cry out upon the german ghouls
 the good pastor too

   his teeth showing in a wolfish smile his
 monocle fixed one hand at the automatic
 in his belt the officer advanced within the
 circle of light followed by several of his
 staff and craning forward gazed upon that
 which had so riveted the attention of the
 three frenchmen

    you are wrong my son pere jean
 replied with dignity  there are no valu-
 ables in these our poor tombs save the
 honored dead they hold 


argosy and railroad mans magazine

  the uhlan stared insolently upon him

   perhaps you will then explain the
trouble to which you put yourself in open-
in this casket

   i will do so pere jean responded with
 quiet nobility of demeanor  tradition
in our little town has it that this son of the
church and of france and one-time officer
of the great napoleon would if brought
from his sepulcher save breaux in its day
of need from impious hands even as his
ancestors did in ancient times

  the officer laughed harshly

   and your theology swallows these chil-
drens fairy tales worthy pastor

  the mayor pelletier answered him

   neither he nor i but this descendant of
de youlxs orderly to humor a good and
faithful citizen we assented that is all
the german rubbed his hands gleefully
well well and why not let us see
if there be any truth in it come forth
my gallic lazarus save thy ugly hamlet
of breaux many prettier towns have gone
up in smoke this past week

  then began a scene such as no other war
but this could match the uhlans teu-
tonic serse of humor rose to the surface
after an orgy of blood and rapine the sur-
teited beast chose to be good-naturedly
facetious for the moment

  obeying a curt command two big cav-
alrymen laid hold upon de voulx and
twitched him from the wooden bed where
he had slept so long they held him erect
clapped his cocked hat upon his head then
their captain catching the travesty of the
emperor in the bloated features he bent
one arm-the brittle bone cracking sharply
-and thrust the hand within his breast
his sword was buckled on the officer
saluted him mockingly hailed him as
 kamerad and entering into the spirit of
the occasion the gruesome figure was
pushed and pulled about complimented
upon his winning so many medals as colonel
of so distinguished a regiment and then
kicked and buffeted for failing to reply to
the queries or to return the salutes

  it was to be noted that throughout the
incredible buffoonery the little figure of
de voulx seemed to maintain an unshaken
dignity which no insult could degrade

dead this century and more the deathless
panoply of birth and character never for an
instant failed to make cheap and bestial his
living mockers

  meanwhile pere jean had been twitching
at the sleeves of his two companions and
step by stealthy step moving backward to-
ward the little door they slipped up the
crooked stairs and through the sacristy
and out into the black night sick at heart
and with the uncouth shouts of the uhlans
sounding fainter and fainter in their horri-
fied ears

  this was the story that lieutenant para-
dis told me as we rode away from breaux
and at this point we reined up for a final
back-tlung look at it

  the moon was riding high in the
heavens now and beneath its rays the little
town seemed a fragile toy fabricated of
beaten silver

   yet you have not told me i com-
plained  what really saved breaux

   colonel eugen etienne ste marie de
voulx saved it replied my guide

   but-but how-

  he turned and looked me in the eye

   a miracle so they are already saying
so say i-for of such stuff are dreams and
miracles made de voulx as has been
learned by painstaking investigation of con-
temporary records died of the black death
the germs of which he brought home with
him from asia his orderly who had served
long in the east recognized the symptoms
and warned the physician who attended
de voulx and the priest who shrived him

   he was able to prevent them from con-
tracting the plague and it was by his ad-
vice that the body was hermetically sealed
in lead and the secret kept from the village

   when the casket was opened the germs
were still virulent still lying in wait none
of the three frenchmen touched the body
but the uhlans who did contracted the
black death by contagion and when the
german medical staff learned the truth
and had cremated their numerous victims
they drew a circle about breaux forbid-
ding under severest penalties any crossing
of the dead line and as this order was not
countermanded de voulx kept his promise
and breaux stands inviolate to-day

tiie verdict

but a moment later when the door
opened and the fat stranger appeared
the last vestige of dignity dropped
from the square shoulders of peter he
sprang to his feet and fairly ran upon the
stranger crying salviati his teacher
caught him in two pudgy arms

   pietro pietro pietro i have ached
to see you as the foot of a bare-legged friar
who has trodden twoscore miles aches for
the touch of warm water pietro i have
learned all i have learned how you kneeled
before the holy father and named my
trouble when you might have asked a thou-
sand ducats for yourself noble pietro

   tush salviati-you are fat and grown
foolish likewise sit down eat drink and
tell me what is in your heart

   italy is in my heart dear boy italy-
white beautiful italy and you pietro
 i am well

  well do you call it so no you
are famous pietro  asked of a fat pedler
the way to the house of one messer peter
warburton he looked me over with a grin
from head to foot-as i am dusty as you
see  perhaps also said the rascal  you
would like to know the way to the vatican
by my heart i laughed aloud i was so
rejoiced to find you known even to the beg-
gars in the streets

   i told him i was a friend of yours off
came his hat as if i had tossed him a coin
and he must needs take me a half-mile on
the way and chatter all the time of the
great master ha ha ha to think that

i am a poor hen and yet i have had the
warmth of heart to hatch an eagle

  peter sat with a smile listening nodding
remembering

   but the statue-and of beatrice della
marca said salviati at last when he had
poured forth a whole ocean of words

   we shall go there-at once my hat
my coat lad

   and what of beatrice pietro you
blush ha well well let us go to see
this statue

  with a great anxiety peter followed by
two of his servants to hold lights opened
the door to his workshop a few minutes
later as a sculptor his opinion of salviati
had fallen much since he had come to rome
and seen the designs of the great masters
but as a critic he knew the florentine was
a man to be respected-even dreaded

  simple as his nature was he knew that
most of the praise he had hitherto received
came from men who wished to praise rather
to find fault but the honesty of salviati
was far far above suspicion

  therefore when the little man first tossed
his hands up and then clasped them to-
gether while he stood in mute admiration
before the venus peters heart bounded like
a horse under the spur he stepped closer
to hear salviatis murmurs of delight

   yes yes he said  when i left en-
gland  thought to find you a great hawk
but i find that my hawk has killed the eagle
in the blue of the sky and flown up higher
higher you shall pass beyond my ken in
another year but where is the whole de-
sign where is the model for without the
head a statue is like a face without eyes

this story began in the argosy for march 


argosy and railroad mans magazine

 peter unveiled the model confidently and
 stood back with an expectant smile it
 was to be the same story then praise and
 sweet words that warm the blood and tilt
 back the head his smile gradually faded
 and then changed to an expression of anx-
 iety for the delight was gone from the face
 of salviati he seemed to hesitate and he
 glanced once or twice toward peter

  speak speak lionardo said peter at
 last   am burning with trouble to see
 you so silent

  may i say the words that are in my
 heart

  yes yes

  then if i were here alone i should
 throw the veil over that model and sit down
 to weep 

 peter strove to smile-to speak he had
 to moisten his lips before he could say a
 word

  what is wrong salviati is it the
 chin yes i know that is not strong and
 sure but  shall remedy that in the marble
 never doubt

  no it is not the chin the chin is very
 well

  the poise of the head then

  no that also is very well

  then in gods name what is wrong
 the little man threw out his hands in
 despair

  is this not the goddess of love

  yes yes venus

  then the goddess of love is a harlot
  unsay that lionardo for the model of
 this is a beautiful and good woman

  pietro-ah that is it she is too beau-
 tiful to be good

  come you quarrel with words speak
 out your heart

  not to this thing which you call the
 venus

  salviati you anger me i say the lady
 is good

  who told you that

  my heart which beats when i see her
 yes when i think of her

  peter venus should be loved by the
 whole world but only one man could love
 this woman

  do not riddle with words

  you grind your teeth peter alas it

 is no easy thing for me to dispraise i
 came here as ready to see beauty as a
 closed flower is to receive the warmth of
 the sun

   and now-

   i shall say no more it is lovely as
it stands thousands shall praise it and
wonder at it

   but

    but it shall die before the marble crum-
bles it shall not live in the minds of men
longer than its original in the flesh

  peter moved a hand across his forehead
 why did you leave the face till the last
that should have been the first to take
form if beatrice is truly the image diat lies
somewhere in the heart of the artist as the
goddess of love no peter you have
left it till the last a single days work
would make it complete but you have left
it only blocked out as if you would fain
leave it to your imaginings before the piti-
less chisel has marked it with one likeness
forever

   i have indeed delayed the carving of
that said peter heavily  but only be-
cause i fear that i can never reproduce the
perfect beauty of her face

    it is not that you lie even to yourself
and those are the most deadly lies they
arc written in a mans heart like black ink
on white paper my friend my dear pie-
tro i find no fault with the features of her
face but with the soul that should brood
behind them there is no soul but only a
thing of smiles and flesh which reflects the
sun like a mirror shall this be the god-
dess of love-and from your hand no
no peter for the conception is right
where got you that posture

  peter searched through his mind for
the first time he remembered that the pos-
ture was never one of beatrices but of
some other woman he had seen he forgot
whom

   i do not know he answered

   at least not from her said salviati
 but i tell you this from my heart pietro
if you would have your statue live go back
to the lady beatrice and try again to find
a soul under her smiles

    salviati said peter grimly  you have
given me a thousand wounds if you were
the hammer



another man i would-but no i shall not
talk of anger for you have been frank in
my own heart i do not know whether or
not you are right or wrong but i am going
this moment to learn the truth i must go
to the house of beatrice

   wait but a little time pietro for in
this mood you will either stab her to the
heart or take her in your arms-and either
way there is ruin 

   yet i will go return to my house
hither lad and see that my friend messer
salviati is well cared for-with the best
that is in my house so farewell till the
morning lionardo

  he strode away and the little florentine
made a few steps after him calling out
when he met with no response except the
waving of the fur on peters coat he turned
about and resigned himself to theconduct
of peters servants

chapter xxix

the song of songs

the englishman went on with lowered
head the words of salviati beat into
his ear with every stride and broke up his
thoughts in this confusion he stood at
last in a room of della m areas house and
waited for the coming of beatrice he
went before a casement and looked from it
without seeing the moonlit street below him
thick with crowds who rejoiced in the warm
spring air

  pietro she called behind him as
he turned she stood dressed in clinging
white with her arm still lifted above her
head as she paused aside the violet velvet
tapestry she had much affected simple
white since the first day he sketched her
as she met him she dropped both her hands
in his her head tilted back as she smiled

  it is long since you have come to me
pietro

   two days

three days-four days-a week

   xo only two days

   how can you be so sure

    you see he explained  i have made
me a rule never to come to see you oftener
than every other day

   her head turned quickly peter relin-
 quished her hands  you are laughing at
 me again beatrice

  he touched her face and made her turn

   it is well that you only smile some-
 times you anger me when you laugh

    i cannot help it-sometimes you are
 very odd xo no i did not mean in that
 way but your thoughts move on so-so
 ponderously like the tread of a marching
 column do you see-that  cannot help but
 laugh-sometimes

   she gave example immediately for seeing
 the grave pondering in his face she broke
 out into laughter she checked it as soon
 as possible

  -now you are very angrv messer
pietro

    at least the sound is pleasant he
 decided

   anxiety and amusement were both in her
 smile

    you are a careful critic she said
  therefore that is a mighty compliment
 he said  when you blush like that i
 know you are happy and then i wish that
 i were a painter so that i could copy the
 color let us sit over here

    but why here the bench is of hard
 cold stone

    aye but the moonlight shines here
 and i must see you clearly

   during a long silence he held her with
 his glance relentlessly her eye wavered
 here and there uneasily but was always
 drawn back to his face

   i do not mind your stare she sakl at
 last  but why do you scowl so pietro

    because i am trying to find something
 he said

   she clapped her hands together with a
 little burst of passion

   are you a sculptured man is your
 flesh bloodless wood have you no feeling
 pietro

    it is pleasant to see you when you are
 angry beatrice

   she checked the r- orls even as they
 hung poised on her ups

    you see it sets a tint of yellow fire in
 your eyes he explained

   and you do not care why i am angry
   shall i ask the wind why it blows

e

this is idle talk is it not he continued
 and  have come here for a purpose to-
night why do you flush again

   what is your purpose

   to study you no do not turn away
he caught both her hands and made her
sit facing him

   i cannot tell whether to be angry or
to laugh or smile she said faltering

   by my faith beatrice you seem nearer
to weeping than to any of the other three
her hands tugged at his but his grip
held

  she said  you have such a frown that
i cannot see your eyes in the shadow i
am afraid let my hands free

   if i did that you would turn away
he answered  now you smile that is
well you are no longer angry

   foolish pietro you have seen me many
a time why do you look so scowlingly on
me now

   because i have come to study not
merely to admire i have been troubled
about the venus you see

   ah but i have heard it praised from
a thousand sources they tell me it will
be a masterpiece why will you not let
me come to look at it

   not until the head is done then you
may see it is the head which troubles me
i do not like the model

   then you find fault with me

  he did not heed the hardness of her
voice but answered

   i have wondered whether the fault was
in me or in you a friend told me to-night
that the trouble lies in you

   ah who is this friend

   the yellow is in your eyes again bea-
trice he is a dear comrade of mine he
taught me all i know

   i would give many round ducats to see
this fellow-this prodigy of wisdom where
has he seen me it was in the morning
pietro very early and then sometimes there
are shadows under my eyes and i look older
than i am-because of the slanting light

i	hate the morning

   no he has never seen you

   then his tongue should be clipped for
an insolent rogue

   hush he criticised your soul and not

 your face i was troubled also but i see
 now that the fault was mine not thine

  tell me

  i have made a venus that is flesh and
 flesh wrinkles and grows old

 he fell musing with downward eyes

  look up she whispered  for whe
 you look down i know that your thoughts
 are far from me

  no i was thinking of you even then
 ah beatrice in these white hands you hold
 my heart and play with it when i am with
 you when i am away there is a differ-
 ence 

  why why if you stop there i shall
 hate you pietro

  i do not know but when i am away i
 think i forget i only remember that you
 are beautiful

  i would not ask for more than that
  would you not he asked wondering
 deeply

  no truly what woman would ask
 for more she said

  why beatrice i have known men in
 love to whom the thought of a woman was
 like a speaking voice

  i hate soliloquies pietro if you have
 thoughts of me let me hear them as for
 the others-

 she waved such idle things away into
 the thin air peters eyes burned as they
 followed the flash of the white arm

  i shall go to see messer antonio della
 marca he muttered softly  on the mor-
 row i understand him at last

  what do you say pietro

 my friend salviati is a fool i shall
 tell him so

  and who is he

  beatrice you are beautiful

  you have said that she smiled and
 then leaned a little toward him  but tell
 me again and again and again you have
 never spoken before as you speak now
 out of the noises of the street grew a
 girls singing voice faint with distance

  beatrice-

 he stopped breathing with difficulty

  it is always this way beatrice when i
 sit close to you my pulses thicken and go
 fast and you change and i catch the fra-
 grance of some violet perfume that is always
the hammer



near you and a madness grows into my
blood

  she watched him with great eyes

   beatrice you tremble

   and you also pietro

   you are dearer to me-dearer than the
marble venus

  the singing girl was drawing closer she
sang in a strange language the white
arms of beatrice rose her hands rested
on the shoulders of peter

   tell me more peter tell me more

   beatrice when your lips are so close
and your arms i forget all other things
let salviati be damned i shall not strive
to worship aught but this marvelous white
body

  the voice of the singing girl rose clearly
from the street and thrilled about them

  the arms which locked her to him
loosened  listen he whispered

   i can hear nothing but your voice

   no no listen again the singing
from the street

    care not

   you shall care for it is love come
 what is it pietro i hear only a com-
mon ballad 

   ah it is the song of songs

  he led her quickly to the window and
they looked down the singing girl dressed
brightly in short skirts and with a wreath
of leaves about her head walked slowly
down the street strumming a lute and her
head tilted as she sang the moonlight
fell on her red-gold hair

   what is it pietro you tremble
again dear pietro

  listen ah god bc-atrice can you
not understand

  under the casement she came paused
her head raised with the ecstasy of a high
sweet note a little crowd followed her
paused with her and went on with her
down the street

  beatrice caught peter by the arms as he
turned from the window but the passion
was dead in his face and his eyes stared
past her an infinite distance into space she
could not tell how far she could not follow
his thought as it fled many a hundred
leagues past river and mountain and the
blue sea

   she only knew that he had dropped far
 away from her in a single instant and she
 connected the change with the leaf-crowned
 face of the singing girl who had paused
 beneath the window

   pietro she pleaded and drew him

 	closer he pushed himself gently away and
 still his eyes stared pasther she was
 desperate now  pietro turn back to
 me what has happened

    sonia he said and rushed from the
 room

chapter xxx

the will of the hammer

 yjthen he reached the street sonia and
 her following group had disappeared
 but he thought that he heard the singing to
 the north he ran a little distance in that
 direction up an alley and then came to a
 sudden halt for now the song came faintly
 from the west even as he turned it died
 out

    he ran on at full speed his coat flapping
 wildly about his shoulders until at the turn-
 ing of a corner he ran into the midst of a
 group of the night watch they stopped
 him and asked if he were pursued but he
 wrenched himself away and fled on down
 the street

   sometimes he thought heheard the music
 again but always fainter perhaps it was
 in his own thoughts for the phrases of the
 lyric ran in his brain for an hour he
 searched here and there

   at last he came to a halt panting and
 half exhausted and realizing that he could
 never hope to find her in this wilderness of
 crooked streets nevertheless if he could
 not find her sonia would find him even as
 salviati had done any beggr in the
 streets could direct her perhaps even
 while he talked with beatrice she had been
 to his house and asked for him he struck
 his hands together at the thought

   then a great and unreasoning elation
 swept over him and he walked on singing
 it was the ballad he had heard on the lips
 of sonia but he did not know that in
 fact she had dropped from his mind all
 thought of her and even beatrice vanished
	argosy and railroad mans magazine

 like wind-blown torches in the night and
 there remained the venus

  he knew now that he could unveil that
hidden face and a frenzy of eagerness filled
him he could not wait for the dawn but
went directly to his workshop to pace up
and down with the sheeted models ghostlike
about him and still the thought of the
venus grew out upon him like a speaking
voice telling him more more more

  the day began with an uncertain gray
the white statue stole from the gloom and
as peter stared at it he began to vision
the face which held that passion before
the day brightened his thought was clear
he picked up the chisel and then the ham-
mer that heavy hammer which was like
another mind to him he weighed it in his
hand and then shook it above his head with
a laugh of exultation still the day grew
it was bright and the venus glimmered

  his assistants came in a group one of
them seeing his master stand with hammer
and chisel before the statue and in his
richest dress smiled askance to his com-
panions and offered peter a mantle before
he started work but peter drove them
from the shop and bade them keep out
all visitors that day as they closed the
doors behind them he raised his tools and
attacked the head

  it seemed to him as if that head lay
merely wrapped in outer layers of the white
stone his only duty was to free the cap-
tive and give her to the day he worked
with fury the chips flew-the marble dust
settled over his fine velvets from the vigil
and excitement of the night he was trem-
bling- hot and cold weak and strong
alternately

   his assistants outside the door listened
to the incessant beat of the hammer and
they heard the master sometimes mutter
sometimes cry out sometimes break into a
song they looked at each other with sig-
nificant eyes now and then

   he is drunk  they would say

   yes drunk but what shall we do

   no he is not drunk fools it is the
passion of his art which is on him

   but he was never like this before did
you notice him when we came in this
morning

 yes he looked as if he had seen some-
thing-or as if he had heard some tidings
 perhaps the holy father had doubled
the price he was to pay and the master is
frantic with delight

   but perhaps he is merely drunk

   yes yes what if he should spoil all
the beautiful work he has done

   then he would beat us fearfully to-
morrow

   nay fool he would flee from rome
to-morrow if he spoiled his work to-day it
would cost a mans life to spoil that block
of marble his holiness they say has set
his heart on it

   yes and on the portrait of the lady
della marca

   how can he make it well when he works
so fast yes he is surely drunk

   let us go to the holy father and tell
him the master is mad

   harken how the hammer beats to
wield it like that would weary me in ten
minutes and he has worked like this half
the day

   this shall be a very glad or a very sad
day for us if he spoils the statue we shall
lose a good master

   you chatter like girls messer stro-
chini himself has praised the work of messer
peter he wrote it in a letter to maestro
pasquino and what he said was told to me
yesterday

   it is past the time for the midday meal
let us go in to him and ask if he will not
eat

   he would strike us with the hammer
and in his hands that would be death
listen it still beats without pause
he has ruled the hammer so long now it
seems as if the hammer were making him
perform its will whether he would or no

   theres a thought too silly for a girl
 i understand him he would kill us
if we broke in upon him now he is not
mad but his brain is on fire so it is with
a man like him all this time he has worked
upon the venus and his soul was smol-
dering to-day some wild wind has raised
the flame and now it bums-it burns 

  so they chattered while the hammer
thudded remorselessly against the chisel
the day wore on still he worked without
the hammer



ceasing they heard him cursing then
he broke off and sang a bit of a ballad
they clutched each other and fell a-whis-
pering

  that evening gradually drew on the
light dimmed slightly

   it is half dark they would say  he
cannot see to work yes yes this is mad-
ness he is ruined and the venus must
be spoiled 

   i would give my hopes of heaven for
one glance at that work he has done to-day
it must be a terrible or a beautiful thing
the apprentices broke off their comments
on their master to eye a girl dressed in
much-worn clothes with a lute pressed
under her arm she came directly toward
them

   who is this singing girl who comes
they asked each other

   look her dress is dusty and there is a
crown of withered leaves on her hair

    have never seen such hair the last
of the sun shining through it makes it a
fire

  she stood before them her lute under her
arm

   gentle sirs i have been to the house of
messer peter warburton and one told me
that i should find him here

   you may not go in are you a model
come to-morrow it would be worth my
place to let you in to him now there is a
mood on him

  the hammering within ceased the pause
continued for the first time that day

  hope fear and sorrow were in her smile

  	kind sirs i have come many hundred
leagues to see him

   the hammer has stopped said one of
them  perhaps he will work no more in
the half light yes you may go in now
but be cautious he is in his mood
shaking and blind with labor peter
stepped back from the statue the last of
his inspiration worked out of him by that
terrific day the venus was done and in
the relaxation of that knowledge his head
swam and a mist rose in his eyes so that
he could not see his work

  at the opening of the door behind he
turned with a curse and faced sonia be-
hind her the three assistants peered with

fearful eyes she seemed to peter like a
figure known in a dream and now seen for
the first time in daylight but her glance
was not for him

  straight past him she looked to the statue
and there her eyes held fascinated a
vague trouble grew in him he saw the
assistants look to one another and whisper
together

   the venus the singing girl

   singing girl fools he cried his weak-
ness passing from him in a sudden childlike
anger and he turned toward the statue
with outstretched arms  xo but venus
the goddess of love the goddess of-

  he stopped his arm stiffened in the
midst of its gesture and the whole shop
went dim with shadows

  suppose a man climbed a mountain-
range expecting to view from the top wide
fields of rich grain in the opposite valley
but when he reached the summit should see
the awful expanse of the sea instead-such
bewilderment was peters

  out of the mass of shadows reeling
drunkenly before him one object held true
and whitely clear the face of the statue it
was the sight of this which dazed him he
struck his hand heavily against his forehead
with a groan and stared again the illu-
sion still held he made a long stride closer
to it

  xo it was not an illusion it was a fact
-an unalterable fact in everlasting marble
the face of the statue was not beatrice but
sonia he no longer heard the horrified
whispers of his assistants as they stole back
through the door they left him all
rome-all his flatterers would leave with
them he had betrayed the commission of
the pope

  it was not beatrice he had made but
the image of a nameless girl-a singing
barbarian girl he felt like a man awaked
from a night of debauch with the past
hours a blank in his mind while a com-
panion sits beside him and reconstructs
his wild exploits during that lapse of
memory

  he turned again

   it is i it is i she was whispering
over and over  but you have made me
more beautiful i never knew-peter-


argosy and rtlroad mans magazine

  she ran to him and caught his hands

   i thought you hated me and  have
been wrong you have thought of w as i
have thought of you i could only make
my yearning for you into songs but you
have made me beautiful in white eternal
stone peter 

  in some way he found her trembling in
his arms while a low murmur troubled her
throat and made her smile-the smile of
venus which all that day he had labored
to make in marble she was no longer that
mute mystery which he had left in england
the difference between the old sonia and
the new was the difference between sleep
and waking water and wine the spoken
word and the song yes the chrysalis was
broken and she had shaken out butterfly
wings

  what did she say to him he did not
know he could not distinguish the words
but only the change of her voice a velvet
softness and warmth and he spoke to
her words which found their way to his
lips without his volition

  he drew closer her expression was that
of one who drinks he stared over her
head at the white venus glimmering above
them she smileda benediction and peter
understood

  sonia he criedi know it all at last
 what do you know peter - dear
peter

   you have taken the veil from my heart
you have opened the door for me you
have led me by the hand into a bright and
glorious hall there sit the immortals who
have created beauty i see their shadowy
lips pledging me above the wine

  her eyes closed she clung to him
swaying

  she whispered  tell me all i am
blind let me see with your eyes

   what is the pleasure or wrath of the
pope sonia we are a whole world in our-
selves look there are a thousand sor-
rows on the lips of venus and your lips
sweet sonia are wet as honey-dew your
love is a magic vintage-wine of the soul
wine of the soul i drink of it sonia
sonia i am drunk with your beauty

  she said  i have crossed half the world
to hear you speak

   it is not new i feel as if our love
were some divine remembered thing

   far south-far south you have told
me this a thousand years ago and while
you spoke the wind stirred in the palm-trees
over us and the moonlight ran like water
on the limbs of dancing girls before us
and the stars were the golden eyes of heaven
seeing us and the very gods leaned from
their thrones to know our love

    and there is music sonia the rhythm
-the fierce glad rhythm-can you not
hear it hush can you not hear it now
 yes for it is the beating of our hearts 
 we must talk no more now sonia we
must fly from rome as quickly as swift
horses will bear us

    what is there to fear

   the wrath of the holy father he
wished a portrait of beatrice della marca
and i have made a portrait of thee he
will be terribly angered his favors and
his money have been showered upon me
he will throw me into prison did you
see how the three fellows sneaked off even
now they may be gone to tell what i have
done and then vengeance will overtake
me

   and still they did not go but talked on
or fell into silences while the shadows drew
out in the workshop and the venus became
a glimmering thing in white to be guessed
at rather than seen

   and while they still stood together the
doors fiew open again they looked out
and saw that the night was come and
against the night shone four lanterns borne
by a train of armed men the lights flashed
on the helmet and drawn sword of him
who stepped forward peter made a stride
to meet him

  you have come for me he said
quietly

    arc you the master pietro warbur-
ton

    i am he

    and the singing girl-is this she hold
ui vour light oranno 

   one of the men raised his lantern and
the glow fell on the face of sonia and upon
the head of the venus

    aye it is she strange you must go
with us both of you
the hammer



 bothasked peter  what reason is
in that this is a girl who has but just
come to rome she has done no wrong
 my orders are clear a secretary to
his holiness gave them to me

    let her go free captain and i shall
vouch for her when she is wanted

   that cannot be sir my orders are
strict will you walk before us in that
way no attention will be called to you
peter turned to sonia and whispered
 be brave there is no danger to you
all shall yet be well go with them
quietly

   she smiled as if she heard his voice but
not his words and they took their way
through the streets to the castle of sant
angelo under the arch of the entrance
their feet beat loud echoes up but down
the halls within even the echoes were
muffled

   are our cells close together asked
peter of the captain who had conducted the
capture

   of course not he answered  your
room is in the east tower while her cell-
peter took out his purse and passed it
to the captain

     use this money to buy her comforts she
will need and perhaps you can lodge her
better than your instructions

    it shall be done signor he bowed to
the liberality of the sculptor

   l but if she is not cared for fellow said
peter sternly  i have friends and they
shall remember thee

  peters guards stopped at a door and
opened it with a screeching key sonia
passed on between two soldiers and even
by the torchlight peter could see that she
had not paled peter turned into his room

   he had expected a little lightless place
no larger than the usual cell instead he
found a spacious apartment well furnished
and with an alcove used as a bedchamber
two ample windows admitted light and air
their bars were of the flimsiest nature but
peter felt that to escape down the vast wall
of the castle would be impossible

   not many years later that impossibility
was accomplished by the inimitable ben-
venuto cellini with the assistance of a rope
made of bedding and at the expense of a

broken leg to the agility of peter the
same feat might have been comparatively
easy but he had no thought of escape
while sonia lay in the castle this was be-
yond his dreams

    if there is anything we can bring for
your comfort master- began the captain
 there is nothing said peter

   or a friend to whom we could send a
message

   guido strochini he will pay you for
your pains tell him where i now lodge
that is all

   the captain said his adieus with the ut-
most formality and in a moment the door
closed upon peter the lock ground pon-
derously home he went to the barred
casement and stared out over the dim spires
of rome and down to the street starred
here and there with moving lights

  scarcely an hour before he had been a
notable figure in that city now he was
less important than the simple englishman
who swung his hammer in a petty london
shop yet still he felt no sorrow he was
like the merchant who hears in the same
hour of the loss of a hundred shillings and
the gain of a hundred pounds

   and that night peter slept in prison like
a tired child

chapter xxxi

beatrice and sonia

lie woke with a knocking on his door
and the groan and rattle of the key
in the lock guido strochini entered-the
figure of a guard showed for an instant be-
hind him - and the door closed again
peter sprang out of bed tossed his mantle
around his shoulders but strochini gave
back hurriedly to the door he seemed
indeed to be in a sudden terror peter
stopped short and stared at him

   what the devil guido he asked
sharply  why do you watch me as a dog
watches a panther

    xay nay nay said guido neverthe-
less edging still closer to the door and keep-
ing a keen eye upon his friend  you must
not excite yourself dear peter

 what in the fiends name is this


argosy and railroad mans magazine

roared peter im no tenth wonder for
you to gape at

  he made another step toward his friend
but strochini caught open the door and
slipped half out into the corridor while
his eyes grew large with real fear

   come back said peter with a sense
of uneasy apprehension  have i changed
guido have i turned into a scarecrow
that you run away on the sight of me

   no no you are very well peter but
you must be tired lie down again and i
will come in

   why i am broad awake said peter
with a frown  and why should i lie
down 

   you are red with excitement again
said strochini  and i shall be blamed for
working you up to this humor i will not
come in unless you lie down in the bed
again

   if i loved you one whit less growled
peter   would break your sconce for this
mummery nevertheless here i am in bed
again now tell me what devil has brought
you here to act like this

   all in good time said strochini and
to the further astonishment of peter the
satirist crossed himself devoutly before he
entered the room  all in good time i
shall answer your questions my dear lad
in the mean time the thing for you is ab-
solute quiet your face is thin your eyes
are somewhat sunken you are very ill
pietro

   i tell you i was never better i wish
there was a glass for me to see how hor-
ribly i have changed in twelve hours but
i wont try to understand you guido you
got my message

  in the mean time strochini had fixed his
penetrating eye upon peter as though he
strove to bore into his inmost thoughts by
degrees his strange fears seemed to be slip-
ping from his memory at this question
he brightened at oncc and fell into his usual
gay manner as he answered

 your message scoffed strochini
 my dear lad by the lime your message
reached me your news was stale and cold
 but who told you i had scarcely
reached the castle when- -
 i was at home with a lady tasting

fruit and wine when in runs a messenger
from beatrice della marca  come as fast
as a fleet horse will carry you and i went
faster i reached her panting but she had
less breath than i she ran to me with a
scared look like a child thats seen a ghost
 messer pietro she stammered out twice
or thrice  and what the devil of him
said i

    he is taken-he is gone mad-and is
taken to sant angelo but the sight of
her took me back to life she was wringing
her hands and her lips trembled a time
or two before she could get out a word

  tell me she cried out he has
called you his friend will you serve him
in his need tell me how we shall save
him from the pope

   my money my blood and my good
repute are at his service i said at once

   with that she stammered out a tale
how your apprentices had run to a secre-
tary in the vatican with a wild story that
you had made of the venus not a portrait
of beatrice della marca but a common
singing girl sanseverino was in the room
and heard the tale the devil take him he
rushed at once to the holy father-you
know the burly churchman loves us not-
arid gave him the tale his holiness was
sick and in his grief and anger ordered
the confinement of you and of course of
the girl likewise if she could be found

   and here she broke off pietro and as
i am a true man she threw herself onto a
chair and burst into real tears of real pas-
sion by my heart she thinks well of you
 told her that wine must have done it in
you and not your real self she grew a
little pacified at that but she went on to
talk of a singing girl with red hair who had
passed beneath a casement at which she
and you stood you had acted strangely
and rushed out of the room by god
peter from the way she talked you will
soon be the heir of old della marca when
she named the singing girl a devil came
into her eyes a green devil of jealousy

  he stopped for breath and threw himself
into a chair

   how rome hums with it how rome
hums with it the borgia himself never
made a greater stir 
the hammer



  he changed his voice and something of
his former awe came back in his eyes

   and to think this devil could have
power over you  he said  peter can you
tell me how the impulse came

   i cant tell i had done the rest of the
figure and waited for the head-waited
until some great idea for the face should
come to me-waited to find a soul in
beatrice if you will have it so and i
never found one 

   instead of finding her soul you put the
face of another woman on the venus

  he leaned forward in his earnestness

 tell me more about the singing girl
can you remember any strangeness about
her any unearthly light behind her eyes
 yes golden stars shining through a
deep-blue sky

   so so but tell me what was in your
mind when you carved the head

   it was like a dream to me said peter
slowly- a great thought came to me i
suddenly saw the head of the venus i
went to my shop and threw a veil over the
model of beatrice i dont know i
thought i was making her face if i thought
of it at all-but i felt that i had seen in a
vision the true venus-the goddess of love

   i worked with a blind fury all the day
the face of the vision grew out of the stone
of its own accord and the hammer and
chisel in my hand seemed to have volition
and intelligenceof their own i was mere-
ly the involuntary force which held them
the statue was done with the day i
turned there stood the girl the venus
was the singing girl-sonia

   ha

   i had known her in england she had
followed me here

   alone

   yes  knew that i had ruined the
popes marble i did not care i do not
care now i am happy for i stood in
front of her and told her that  loved her
 but beatrice-oh ye saints she will
be crazed-

   and presently the door opened it was
night i was taken here now guido i
have no care for myself but for the girl
it may be that in their madness they will
find some fault in her-

   yes said strochini with a sinister
dryness that is quite possible by the
saints i begin to think beatrice may be
wrong love might be witchcraft enough
to work this miracle

   what do you mean

   nothing nothing dear peter but i
must go back to a certain proud lady with
a message that will break her heart be-
shrew me if i am ever again a messenger
in such affairs farewell i shall be
present at your trial before the pope

  he took peters hand in a strong grasp
and went from the room into the corridor
where the guard stood watch

   have you the care of messer warbur-
ton he asked

   yes i am jacopo

   heres money for you see that he
has everything he wants-except rope to
hang himself he may speak strangely-
and particularly of a woman called sonia
-the girl who was taken with him

    understand sir

   humor him in everything let him un-
derstand that he has his will

  the man winked and grinned broadly

   and now tell me what have they done
with the girl sonia

   she was put first in an upper cham-
ber much like this

   aye-at first

   but then a charge was brought against
her-

   of witchcraft

   yes and now she is lodged in the
lowest range of the dungeons

  the fellow shivered in disgust and made
a grimace

   a place of rats and mold and water
sir

  strochini stared at him then shrugged
his shoulders and went off slowly down the
corridor pausing several times and shaking
his head the guard looked after him with
some concern

   to my eye he said at last  the girl
is as right a lass as walks in rome he
eyed the coins in his hand and then slipped
them into his pouch  but if she has sold
her soul to the devil have i the money to
ransom her back

  strochini went directly from the castle to


argosy and railroad mans magazine

 beatrice he found her walking up and
 down a room with an impatient step like
 some caged beast of prey her face was
 a singularly transparent white like that of
 one who has watched long over a sick-bed

  you are wrong he said  theres no
 witchcraft in this affair if hes enchanted
 beatrice its by the girls beauty

  a common singer of the streets said
 beatrice

  it seems he had known her in england
 and she followed him here went on stro-
 chini

 the color faded marvelously from her
 throat and cheeks

  what does he say of her guido tell
 me it all how did he look

  feverish thin of face wild of eye

   you are ill peter i said

   what of the girl sonia he answered

   what madness made you change the
 statue i asked him

   the face of sonia he answered

 beatrice made a little gesture to check
 him

  stop she cried as soon as she could
 speak

 strochini felt as if he had some beautiful
 tigress under the whip the cruel pleasure
 thrilled him

  but you asked me of him he com-
 plained

  yes tell me more

 strochini raised the whip again and
 struck

   i care nothing for myself he would
 say  but the girl strochini- 

  ah moaned beatrice

 strochinis heart melted

  i would give a kings ransom to see
 him freed from this folly he said

  i have sent a message to him through
 a man of influence he has heard i think
 he already believes if we can manage it
 so then pietro will be saved-restored to
 favor 

  but this charge of witchcraft beatrice
 the penalty is death and the heart of the
 holy father is merciful moreover if pe-
 ter hears that the girl is condemned through
 us-

 she uttered a little cry that made stro-
 chini wince

  after a moment in which she stood with
her hands clutched tightly to her breast
 for a time the-the spell may hold him
but in the end-in the end he will forget
tell me he will forget guido

   aye forget yes yes but the pen-
alty is burning at the stake for the girl
beatrice if i am called for testimony i
shall tell the holy father my conviction-
that there is no black art in pietros case
her eyes glittered a moment and her
lips pressed together

   would you believe in witchcraft if you
heard the confession from her own lips
she asked suddenly

   what a fiend she is whispered guido
to himself then aloud you cannot
hope that she will be mad enough to sign
her own death-warrant

   i shall go myself said beatrice  i
shall go to see the girl myself

   why in the name of heaven asked
guido

   i wish to see her did you say she
had followed peter all the way from en-
gland

   yes

   then she loves him

   perhaps said guido

  if she loves him she shall confess
cried beatrice

   if you do that youll be the greater
enchantress

   nevertheless i shall do it

   and how

   i cannot tell you you would not un-
derstand 

   i would not said guido  i think 
shall have to get me a book and write it
full of facts about women as peter has
done

  as soon as he left beatrice went to her
rooms and called two maids at her di-
rection they brought forth the most costly
and beautiful of her gowns she drove her
maids to a greater speed with stinging
words and yet when they could do no more
she lingered still over that toilet as if she
went to interview a king instead of a name-
less girl in a prison

  one servant had already ridden post-
haste to the vatican to acquire the neces-
sary permit before she could be admitted
the hammer



to see sonia when he returned she set
out

  up to the very walls of sant angelo she
urged on her escort togreater and greater
speed but when she passed through the
gate her eagerness waned and cold uncer-
tainty took its place

  the officer of the castle to whom her per-
mit was presented allowed her to enter at
once he suggested with some confusion
that it would be better to have the girl
brought up to her ladyship because the
way was long and down many stairs but
beatrice insisted that they must speak ab-
solutely alone

  when he asked her if she wished no pro-
tection she showed him a tiny silver-hilted
poniard with a blade four inches long a
thin bit of keen steel which a child could
press to the heart with the force of one
finger	f

  with that they started down the steeply
winding stairs the officer first being a
man of some family and culture and now
in the presence of romes social queen he
hummed or whistled a tune as he walked
and kept the rhythm by jangling a bunch
of the heavy prison keys which he carried
one of her servants preceded beatrice and
another followed her both carrying lan-
terns for the stairway was dark as mid-
night after they passed the first turn

  so they came into the lowest passage
apparently hewn through the solid rock
the lantern-light glittered along the low
ceiling where innumerable beads of water
had gathered like sweat on the brow of a
man under foot the same moisture made
the stones slippery and at every breath of
the sick air the lantern-bearers shuddered
dismally

  their mistress paid no heed to the dis-
mal passage but when the jailer stopped
at a low door so cunningly set into the
solid rock that not a crack was visible she
grew pale

   so please you he suggested  it may
be well if i accompanied you when you
speak with the woman within these low-
est cells -he smiled somewhat apologet-
ically- sometimes make the prisoners a
trifle desperate and it might be that this
low creature would forget-

     argosy

   open the door at once said beatrice
 i have no fear

  the door opened silently upon an utter
void of dark - rats squeaked within and
scurried to their holes-a breath of stale
air came coldly out to beatrice she
strained her eyes into the cell but could
see nothing

   does-does a human being live in-in
that hole she asked

   only for a short time said the jailer
suavely  and it is only used for the most
desperate cases - murder witchcraft and
other crimes- too foul to be named

   give me the lantern said beatrice
firmly after another moment of pale-faced
waiting  i shall enter alone and do you
close the door after me

  she held the lantern high and advanced
through the opening at once the door
shut behind her ith the light in her
eyes she could not see a yard straight be-
fore her and lowered her eyes

  the floor was far wetter than the stones
of the corridor and a short distance from
her lying on the green mold lay a loaf of
bread beside a small pitcher of water the
loaf had been tunneled and eaten away to
a crust by the rats

   if you have come for me i am pre-
pared said a low voice

  beatrice lowered the lantern and shaded
her eyes with her hand in a corner she
made out a shadowy figure she moved the
lantern until the light fell full upon sonia
who stood leaning against the angle of the
damp wall

  she had started from the wall at the en-
trance of beatrice but seeing that it was
a woman who stood before her she re-
sumed her former posture her hands
locked loosely before her and her head
slightly bowed at sight of that forlorn
attitude the pity which rose in beatrice
turned cold  you are the woman
sonia she asked

  the great eyes raised considered her a
silent moment and then sank again toward
the floor

   are you the woman sonia repeated
beatrice- held here for foul witchcraft
a singular half smile stirred the lips of
the prisoner


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   i am she she answered and again the
soft music of the voice thrilled beatrice
she stepped closer

   i am beatrice della marca she said
and turned the lantern so that the light
would fall on her own features sonia had
started into life at the name now her
eyes burned against the face of beatrice
 i have come to help you from the prison
i have come as your friend

  again sonia smiled

   you are she whom peter warburton
modeled for his statue she asserted  and
therefore you cannot be my friend the
walls are thick how can you help me
from the prison

   i know the words which will unlock
these doors

   what would you have of me asked
sonia coldly

   one small thing confess to your
witchcraft you are silent and you smile
again but have no fear when you con-
fess youshall be given a light sentence
a mere nominal sentence the holy father
will exile you from his states and i my-
self will give you money which will keep
you in comfort the rest of your days

   and what of peter

   he will receive new marble to make
the statue which he has spoiled all will
be forgiven him if you confess

   that may not be

   and why

   because he loves me

   it was the madness of a moment like
wine to-day he repents and to-morrow
he will forget

   you speak your wish but not the fact
you also love him

   this is folly utter folly i am bea-
trice of the house of della marca and this
is a nameless englishman

   you stammer as you deny and your
voice lingers on his name

   you gibe at me then it is useless for
me to say more to you

  sonia made no answer

   you are reconciled to the death by
fire

   my innocence will be clear as the light
of day

   have you proofs

   his love for me is proof enough

   that is the very thing which will damn
you for will the holy father believe that
love could so bewitch the senses of a man
that he would throw away his fame and
name for a singing girl

  sonias eyes glinted and she advanced a
step from her corner

   go and leave me to my rats i would
not harm you 

   i shall not go for i have not done
if you come nearer remember i am
armed 

the thin-bladed poniard glittered in her
hand

   it would be a simple way to end it all
a single pressure of this knife and peter
warburton would be free to walk on to
greatness 

   you would not dare murder

   say you so what voice would accuse
beatrice della marca when she killed to save
herself from the madness of a witch she
would have helped from prison

  she stepped forward the dagger quiver-
ing eagerly like the light in a stalking pan-
thers eye sonia did not wince

  but i have no wish to frighten you
girl tell me for the last time-have you
determined against a confession learn
this-that the holy father has already re-
solved his mind of your guilt it is not long
before you shall stand before him oh be
wise and tempt his mercy rather than his
justice 

   why do you come here to tempt me i
have no wish for freedom which he does not
share is my life worth as much as our
love go go i had rather have the
squealing of the rats and the whispering of
the dark than to hear your voice

  the voice of beatrice trembled with her
wrath and sense of failure

   i had not dreamed that such selfish
cruelty could exist she cried  you have
followed him like a blight of egypt and
ruined all his bright hopes with your com-
ing and now you will not undo part of your
wrongs is this your love for him this
is the love of the vampire who sucks the
blood from the hearts of men

   in what way have i wronged him
asked sonia and though her voice was
the hammer



steady her lips trembled that sight was
like a cheer of victory to beatrice

   in what way she said rapidly  in
all ways he was on the high road to fame
before you came the protege of the holy
father the friend of guido strochini that
horrible man the sculptor whom cardinals
named with pride as their friend and now
you have struck him down from his high
place into the dust at your side where you
grovel 

  no no moaned sonia it is not
true from his own lips he told me that
i had taken the veil from his eyes that
through me he came to see-

   peace cried beatrice trembling a
madness has come to him but it will pass
you may undo part of the crime against
him confess freely before the holy father
he will remove you gently from rome you
may live your life as you will in another
place but spare peter from further ruin
if you confess all will be well the pope
shall forgive him the great will return to
his side rome will be again at his feet
 and our love-

   do you think he prizes any woman be-
side his work with thechisel and hammer
do you think he would change all the wo-
men in the world for one creation of beauty
in white stone

  she saw sonia wince and shut her eyes as
if she had been struck heavily across the
face

   for a day or two he might fall into a
mood for thee but the hammer is the only
wife he can ever love truly his work
will drive you a thousand leagues back in
his memory a pretty forgotten thing-a
singing girl pah

   he said-

   words are easily born but look you
girl if you free him from this slavish con-
trol he will go on to greatness

   and to you said sonia breathing
quickly

  beatrice raised the lantern above her
head the light flamed on her jewels it
flashed in the diamond net that rested over
her throat it glimmered over her gown of
woven threads of gold

   will you compare yourself with me
  alas you are beautiful she said

   what can you bring him except the
companionship of beggars and disgrace
in my halls he shall company with princes
he shall inherit a vast wealth he shall
quarry his own marbles in carrara and
bring the stone of greece in his own ships
what can you give him to compare with
this ruin disgrace scorn shame and
hate suppose you live he will see the
token of his fall in the very brightness of
your eyes his love will turn to loathing
his glance will be an eternal reproach

   lower the lantern mine eyes dazzle
said sonia

  ah said beatrice why do i say these
words to a nameless creature it is not
love you have for him but a foul passion
for love would make you die a thousand
times before you would be his ruin 

  she stopped marveling at the change
which came about in the face of sonia the
crimson of rage and fear died away her
eyes fell on beatrice with a level glance
under which the great lady trembled so that
all her jewels glowed and flashed

    lady beatrice she said  i have littfe
knowledge and i should thank you for
showing me the true way

  the poniard of beatrice clinked on the
floor as she clasped her hands

   you will make the confession you
will confess ah i knew that those wide
eyes told of a great heart beneath them

i will make you rich and-

  sonia drew a quick breath and turned her
eyes suddenly away

   do not name it let me be alone go
for i shall do all that you wish

  ah god and what will you tell
them

   i have heard a tale of witchcraft i
shall speak of wax images i-i prav you
go 

   sonia 

   do not touch me

  	will you hate me for telling you-the
truth

   the thought of him has been in my
heart like a child in the womb of a mother
and now that love shall be still-born and
have a grave without a name

   i shall find a way to make you happy
   aye by leaving me

   if you are alone i fear for you your
eyes are wild

   i shall not be alone the priests say
god comes to those who suffer farewell

judgment

     ith sanseverino in a chair beside him
and a little to the rear leo x waited
in a small room of the vatican for the entry
of the criminals it had been suggested that
he leave the trial and the judgment to san-
severino but his interest in peter and the
unusual nature of the case determined him
to give it his own attention

  it was a rare exception for as a rule his
gentle nature revolted against the trial and
sentence of crimes which called for the
death penalty accordingly he gathered all
those who were familiar with the plan of the
venus statue or intimate with peter

  if the sculptor had been changed by some
violent exterior force his friends could best
testify to the greatness and peculiarity of
that change around the room sat the cap-
tain of the arrest and antonio della marca
with beatrice beside him guido strochini
and a secretary to record the proceedings

  first of the prisoners peter entered be-
tween two armed men at sight of the
escort the holy father raised the inevitable
spy-glass to his eye and then lifted his hand

   stand outside the door sirs he com-
manded  messer peter himself shall be
my guard in case of danger

  then as peter knelt before him  rise
my son strange wild tidings have come
to me of thee but what that strong
heart of thine never conceived knavery
no i shall not believe it not a word to
me take yonder chair

  peter had scarcely taken the designated
chair when the door opened again and two
other soldiers tall fellows of the swiss
guard appeared leading sonia each of
them held her firmly by the arm but the
holy father showed no intention of giving
her greater freedom like the rest of the
people in the room he stirred in his chair
and leaned a little forward

   is this the woman he said at last
 she is young-young and comely for such
foul practise

   the black art of knavery hath often a
white face rumbled sanseverino

   peace sanseverino and yet you say
the truth it must be so secretary ex-
amine this woman 

  the secretary rose holding his scroll
ready to write down the answers to the
questions which he had already prepared
the swiss turned sonia with unnecessary
hands to face him and peter clenched his
fists his glaring eyes crossed the frightened
and nervous glance of beatrice but he did
not see her

   look well to the englishman holy
father said sanseverino hastily  for
theres a red devil in his eye hell be at
the throats of the swiss in another mo-
ment

   hush sanseverino he knows in what
presence he sits even if he be quite en-
chanted begin secretary

  but by the mass said the burly car-
dinal under his breath  she seems quite
singularly composed

   are you the woman sonia asked the
monotonous voice of the secretary

   my name is sonia she answered and
because perhaps of the tense expectation
in the room the soft quality of her voice
caused a little stir

   ask by whom she is directly accused
broke in the pope

   let the person stand forth who accuses
the woman sonia of the practise of black
arts and enchantment said the secretary

  the lady beatrice della marca rose from
her chair

   it is- she began but here her eye
crossed the furious and horrified glance of
peter and she faltered

  holy father cried peter springing
up  the lady beatrice has never known
this girl and her testimony and accusation
are worthless as-

   be silent messer peter said the pope
but not unkindly  you shall not speak
unless you are first required proceed
beatrice my child

   do you beatrice della marca said the
secretary turning to her  do you accuse
the hammer



the woman sonia of the practise of black
art and witchcraft against the person of a
christian man peter warburton

   i do said beatrice faintly

  her eyes were upon the face of sonia
but the latter looked straight before her

   watch the woman holy father ad-
vised sanseverino leaning close to the pope
 for she cannot face her accuser

  the secretary turned back to sonia

   you are here accused he said  of
the practise of black enchantment exercised
upon the person of peter warburton it is
stated here in writing which you shall over-
look if you so desire

   i do not so desire said sonia in the
same calm voice

   then it is stated herein went on the
secretary  that you have so worked upon
the mind of peter warburton that when he
wrought on a statue called a statue of
venus and to be made in the shape and
the portrait of the lady beatrice della
marca at the special commission of the
holy father you have so worked upon him
that in a moment of madness he made in-
duced by your art not her semblance but
a likeness of thee this is so written herein
stand up peter warburton

  peter rose

   speak said the secretary  do you
or do you not know this man known as
peter warburton

   i do know him

   you have heard the charge against you
you acknowledge the man who confronts
you before this examination proceeds
state here do you or do you not confess to
the working of these enchantments upon
him

   she must face the man when she speaks
of him said sanseverino  she has not
even turned toward him and unless she has
eyes in the back of her head how could she
know him

   turn to the man commanded the
pope

  she moved slowly about her eyes raised
by slow degrees from the floor until they
reached the face of peter she cried out
and caught her arm to her face a hum
and a breathless whisper passed around the
room

   do you or do you not confess droned
the secretary

   sonia be brave cast the lie in their
teeth cried peter i swear they shall
not harm thee speak to them

  she moaned turned from him and drop-
ping her arm from her face  i confess it
freely

   merciful god cried leo  can such
guilt lie in so fair a flower

  she shrank and dared not face him
urged sanseverino  the devil was shamed
to look upon his handiwork

   beatrice pale but eager clung to the arm
of antonio della marca he patted her
hand but kept his eyes in horror on the
face of the confessed witch

   it is written droned the secretary
 that the woman sonia has confessed it
must be further-

   hold  cried peter waking from the
white-faced trance into which sonias state-
ment had stricken him  here is some
devilish work of underhand and-

  silence peter warburton said leo
sternly  this matter concerns not thee
alone but the welfare of all christian souls
proceed secretary

   it must be farther learned went on
the secretary  in what manner were your
arts practised 

  sonia dropped to her knees and stretched
her arms to the pope

   have i not said enough she cried
 the guilt be on my head for all that he
hath done but spare me the telling of all
that i have done

  peter sat with his face buried in his
hands he groaned now and beatrice della
marca shuddered as if the sound came from
her own throat

   poor woman said his holiness never-
theless shrinking in his chair a little from
those outstretched hands as if he feared a
baleful influence which might fly from the
tips of her outstretched fingers  poor wo-
man i may not spare thee from this farther
suffering it is not for my pleasure our
father in heaven witness me but for the
future safety and understanding of men
speak

  she rose half dragged up by the swiss
guards

    


argosy and railroad mans magazine

   holy father said peter grinding his
teeth  be merciful to me bid those hired
dogs loose their hands from the arms of
my lady or i shall not answer for myself
even in thy presence

   think of your safety holy father
whispered sanseverino

   i fear me said leo  that i think too
much upon it loose her arms fellows
now speak to me and speak verity

   i knew said sonia in a faint voice
 that he worked upon the statue of the
lady beatrice della marca

  she paused

   it is recorded said the secretary
 speak on

 of wax i made an image of the statue
 but how woman said the pope  did
you know the semblance of the woman
whom he modeled are you not but re-
cently come to rome

   an evil spirit azra came at my bid-
ding thus she made a singular sign with
her hand  he fears me and he serves my
pleasure when i commanded he described
all the acts of the man peter warburton
her voice grew thick she stopped a
moment she hesitated and then went on
determinedly and drew on the blank
void the semblance of the statue from
that i copied i made the wax figure a
perfect copy-with the aid of azra 

  the holy father made the sign of the
cross and glanced up the others in the
room with the exception of peter and bea-
trice followed his example

   then she went on her words falling
almost to a whisper  i painted all the
part of the statue below the head in white
-but the head itself i painted in black to
confuse his thoughts when he labored on it
then i came forthwith to rome and there
i went to a place below the window of the
lady beatrice della marca when i knew
that peter warburton was in her house-i
was singing with my lips but i revolved
enchantments with my heart-

  horror and grief were writ large on the
face of peter she faltered but went on in
a voice still lower fearfully distinct  i
sang beneath that window he looked
down to me seeing my face with the spell
of my enchantments about him he could

not choose but make my image as the head
of his statue

  her head bowed the silence held mo-
ment after moment color was coming
back to beatrice peter and strochini
stared at each other incredulous

   is there aught more to confess asked
the secretary  or is the holy father satis-
fied with what has been heard

   the ways of god are wondrous mused
leo  and to adjudge death to this fearful
soul-

  sonia started at the word  death but
was immediately quiet again

   this fearful soul in this lovely garb of
flesh went on leo it is a grim thing but
there is a sword in the hand of justice and
at times we must wield it lead the girl
away and thou sanseverino my right hand
of iron see that she is punished in the way
the law directs

  the swiss took the arms of sonia again
and led her toward the door

  take care for the englishman said
sanseverino sharply  the devil still works
in his soul and madness is on him

  even as he spoke peter sprang up and
barred the way to the door the guards
shrank back from him loosed the arms of
sonia and left her free before him

   go your way and let me go in mine or
else you may be more evilly blasted than
before she said but she dared not look
in the white horror of peters face

   guards take her away mad messer
peter stand back called leo

   sonia he was saying  tell me that
you have not spoken truly dear heart
at one word from you i will deny and anni-
hilate all that mine ear has heard tell me
that you are as true as you are dear to me
-still dear to me so help me god-sonia
she cried out again as she had cried out
when she first looked at him and then
dropped to her knees clinging to him

   holy father cried beatrice  the
devil has taken hold of him again free
him with your power

  with one hand peter fondled the head of
sonia the other hand he stretched to the
holy father

   is this the way of wizardry he cried
 holy father if there has been witchcraft
the hammer



it has been the power which has made her
speak the false confession

   hear my voice also called strochini
 for the sake of peter warburtons fame
i have hoped against hope that there was
truly enchantment in the madness which
made him change the statue holy father
in spite of the words which the girl has
spoken i do not believe her guilt
guido said beatrice in soft fury
 you shall live to count this the blackest
day of your life

   is it marvelous strange said leo
 now may god guide us rightly here 

   holy father said beatrice  has not
the woman spoken of her free will

  look on them now said strochini
for peter had raised sonia and she clung
to him weeping bitterly  when has the
black art taken on such a form if it has
often then i wish me bewitched

    saint peter witness me  said the pope
 yonder is a theme for raphael yet she
is damned by her own confession evil is
still more fearful when it comes in a lovely
form

   hear me holy father said strochini
 if some evil force worked in him it would
surely show in the face of his statue let
us go to the house in which it stands and
there it may be that you will arrive at a
truer judgment

   true guido said leo  it may be
well and we shall go thither but it would
need a miracle to -save this girls lost soul
 you are ill child antonio della marca
was saying to beatrice  i shall call a
horse litter and carry you home you
tremble and your face is hot with fever
 nay she said and her eyes held
fiercely to sonia and peter clinging to-
gether   shall go mad if  do not hear
the popes judgment with my own ears
ah i do not fear his wisdom so much as
the voice of god against me

  the whole train was mounted in a few
moments a small squadron of the swiss
guard being horsed to escort them and they
hurried through the streets to the workshop
of peter pacing up and down before the
shop with his ominous bodyguard near
strode lord henry of gilford as peter
alighted the noble rushed to him thrust

aside strochini as if he were a foot-boy
and caught the hands of his friend

   ah peter he murmured  i have
heard a fearful tale of your misfortune it
is not true nay you need not answer
for i see you at liberty

  peter smiled sadly

   it is true he answered  this is the
end of my brief day in rome harry they
have brought me here to my last trial the
life of a woman now depends on the elo-
quence of a dumb stone-the face of a
marble statue which i have carved with my
clumsy hands come and stand close beside
me for i need a friend

  but gilford was staring rapt and pale
on the face of beatrice during the next
few moments he never moved his eyes

  in the mean while one of the swiss find-
ing the shop locked shattered the bolt with
a single stroke of his halberd the double
doors swung in under the impact of the
blow and the train dismounted and entered
the shop

  outside the sun was bright the very
touch of the fresh air had been enough to
banish all thoughts of enchantments and
black arts now as they entered the shop
the spell of the artist fell truly over them

  on all sides stood marbles and fragments
of veiled statuary here lay a chisel per-
haps just as he had dropped it as he finished
the last stroke there lay the hammer
with the handle polished by his grip peter
strode to the venus and seized the cloth

   it may be you will find little beauty
here he said  but ah sirs if you look
closely you will find an honest and mighty
aspiration that could have no black art in
it

  and he threw the covering from the white
marble

  through a crack in the patched roof
struggled a single broad ray of sunshine
it had played unnoticed on the grimy sur-
face of the veiling cloth now it fell as
golden fire on the head of the statue and
gave it glowing life among the shadows of
the room peter could not see this for
he stood too close beside the venus but
as his eyes glanced quickly around the circle
of faces he set his teeth in despair

  they did not speak they did not even

whisper or shift their eyes to one another
to exchange comment but with wide glances
they stared on his work then he saw the
great arm of sanseverino rise-saw his
broad hand all forgetfiil of reverence clutch
the shoulder of the pontiff-heard him say
in an awful whisper  it is enchantment
indeed but white magic

   hush said leo  do not speak it
is not a portrait of the lady beatrice or of
any woman but a greater thing the god-
dess of love herself

  guido the irrepressible the universal
scoffer his eyes shifted from the statue and
fell upon peter where they lingered with a
great awe then peter heard the first truly
audible sound it was the sobbing of the
lady beatrice

  then a member of the swiss guard a
burly fellow cried out softly in his own
tongue peter became aware of a growing
murmur the spy-glass of pope leo turned
from the statue to its creator he was
smiling graciously and nodding and every
nod spelt a letter of the word  triumph

   peter friend peter whispered gilford
at the sculptors shoulder  you have con-
quered again and like alexander there are
no more worlds left for you but what
think you of me there stands the loveliest
lady in italy weeping her heart out i will
not guess why lest the guess should make
me hate thee but how say you peter will
i succeed as a comforter as well as you have
succeeded as a sculptor

   go speak with her said peter out of
an overflowing heart  and may god pros-
per you

  and while the rest thronged close about
peter gilford leaned close to beatrice
whispering sorrow unlocks the heart and
in the end gilford indeed prospered

  but gilford and indeed all the rest of
the world dropped for a time out of peters
consciousness during a fortnight more he
was busy putting the final touches to the
venus but when that was done-when the
marble was finally put in place and un-
veiled when the cheering had died from
his ears and the last of the letters of con-
gratulation answered-all else died out of
his mind and sonia remained

  he was content with all his big simple
heart his turbulent past became a thing
of little moment to him this was the great
adventure

  see him again a month after the unveiling
of the venus peter a six weeks married
man

  the summer days have come and after
the heat and dust of the workshop peter
takes a barge down the tiber with sonia
beside him the river is strangely cool and
quiet the creaking of the long oars as the
two rowers sway rhythmically back and
forth accentuates the silence

  peter raised his hand his boy who
crouches at the bow of the boat strikes
his lute and sings in a light glad voice
which wanders far away across the black
sliding waters he ceases the tremor of
the last chord struck upon the lute dies out

    sonia says peter  all your life before
i knew you is as unknown to me as this
silence

  she turns to him  the strangely solemn
face of those who are greatly happy

   it is too sad to speak of now some
time i shall tell you

    not if it is a dreary tale

   aye but that dreary tale took me from
poland to london peter is not this worth
one unhappy year

    from poland he cried and the rum-
ble of his deep voice seemed strangely loud
across the silent waters

   yes my father was a rich landholder
he would have had me marry a silly youth
with a rich father it is a long story
finally i put on the dress of a singing girl
and took a lute and wandered away from
home

  she was silent they heard the waters
lapping in quick whispers at the prow of
the boat

   and wandered clear to london sonia

   no first  fell into the hands of a
slave-dealer he tried to sell me many
times but i was not pleasant to my masters
and they returned me to the slave-dealer
and so he was forced to bring me with him
all the way to london

  she dropped a hand over his great
clenched fist

   you must not be so angry peter all
the hammer



that is past in london i escaped and
wandered through the streets until i stum-
bled in a drift of snow and had not the
strength to rise i fell asleep thinking to
die and instead i woke and found you
isnt that like a fairy tale

  he muttered something between his set
teeth

  they had come down the river toward the
portion which supported long rows of houses
on either bank yellow lights fled across
the current and as the barge passed the
shaft of light would touch the gold hair of
the boy crouched at the bow the swarthy
muscular arms of the rowers and last of all
glint on the emerald in sonias hair it
was the gift of sanseverino

  other barges were in view drifting down-
stream finally one came toward them a
monstrous galley brilliant with lights and

loud with music and laughter a dozen
oars rhythmically swayed and flashed on
either side of it

  it came closer there were perhaps
thirty people in the boat beside the rowers
in the high seat of honor in the waist of the
galley sat a lady crowned with flowers on
either side of her a negro slave held aloft a
bright lantern behind her leaned a man
who whispered in her ear

  as they passed she turned and laughed
up to him it was beatrice della marca
with harry of gilford peters little barge
crept by them unnoticed the great galley
drove swiftly on into the night leaving a
shivering trail of laughter behind

  sonia glanced covertly at peter he was
staring straight before him and smiling into
the dark and sonia leaned back with a sigh
she was content

            the end

in retrospect

jhe sunlight filters through the smoke and dust
and warms my sixteenth-story window-pane
where seated at my desk i plan a trust
or how to break one which to mes the same

it warms me and i dream of home again
the way it looked when early spring first showed
in golden buttercups along the road

	spring you are a rapture to the boy

and oh the gipsy wanderings you provoke

	now recall with what a truant joy

i pulled the angleworm until he broke
and waited at the pond with stone to soak
the frog when he should swell his throat to sing
the universal madness of the spring

oft while along the budding lane ive trod
barefoot and bathed in aprils golden sun

ive watched my father break the stubborn sod
in fragrant rippling furrows one by one-

but soon too soon those happy days were done
for i grew up and had to guide that share

and so im glad this spring that im not there

w me cyncal wentworth said

          women and beggars said
the other scornfully  women and beg-
gars you are mad wentworth to match
the two women are not beggarly they are
imperial wherf they come to us at all it
is in wistful pomp or in august splendor
but always in triumph and beauty never
in tattered trousers and broken shoes

   nevertheless they are much the same
wentworth replied he had the faculty of
becoming inscrutable when he desired to
 both of them he went on  beggars and
women rely on sympathy to win their ends
both make the most primitive appeal-to
an emotion to a passion the desire of one
is the corner saloon of the other the lead-
ing salon the appeal of the woman is the
appeal of the beggar the appeal of the
beggar is the appeal of the woman-the
feminine appeal the soft appeal the ap-
peal to our weakness not to cur strength
 there are moments when weakness is
no less than strength his opponent re-
torted the man had eyes quite different
from the eyes of wentworth where the
latter was inscrutable much in the same way
that the greek fate was inscrutable bat-
tersea was inscrutable only because a mys-
tic not because of a supreme coldness and
aloofness and cruelty his eyes were
almond-shaped but to those who knew him
this was simply the perfection of a highly
etched soul showing outwardly

   deny it wentworth said warmly
 weakness is never strength weakness is
the negation of strength do not think me
unjust i know that ninety-nine beggars
out of one hundred are frauds and fakes
and worse  know that one hundred beg-
gars out of one hundred are frauds and
fakes and worse i have never met an
honest beggar the phrase itself is a para-
dox and i deny that paradoxes are true
outside of the covers of a chesterton novel
the truth is simple and straight hew to the
line and you do not beg

  battersea threw back his head and
laughed  you live in a world all your
own he told wentworth  it is not a
world of flesh nor a world of spirit it is a
world of intellect unredeemed by fire and
purpose other than the attainment of itself
-whatever that cold mysterious thing is
now i say to you that i will grant you
that ninety-nine beggars out of one hundred
are frauds and fakes and worse but-
there is the one hundredth beggar

   there is no one hundredth beggar the
other said stubbornly

   somewhere about this city to-night
battersea said  there is an old man or a
young man an old woman or a young wo-
man-this one is the one hundredth one
though his or her ninety-and-nine fraudu-
lent contemporaries are fraudulent this one
is true this one is needy

   well let us test this thing practically
wentworth said wentworth worshiped


the one hundredth beggar



that most facile unreal unsubstantial thing
-practicality

    yes let us test this thing-mystically
said battersea

   first one then the other i tell you
battersea i am in dead earnest about this
for the moment i am your mortal enemy
for my philosophy and your philosophy
clash and  my truth is the truth for the
good of our souls we must settle this thing
for if there is the one hundredth beggar
then my past life is something too dreadful
to think about too horrible to think about
i am damned-if it is true this thing you
say

   you are wrong battersea said wearily
 for though our philosophies clashed until
doomsday we could live side by side con-
scious of a unique striving both of us-a
striving for something the world cares noth-
ing about-truth we are all of us beggars
before this

   i will not be swerved by your damned
obscurities  the other cried  let us go
on the street and settle this thing we are
two blocks from the ugliest street in the
world-the bowery there is where we
shall settle this thing

   i will go with you battersea said
 but nothing will be proved for i know
that there is nothing to be proved there is
only something to be believed

   rot snapped wentworth and they
went out of the restaurant and to the
bowery

   i will walk on the other side of the
way wentworth said  for it is darker
there and one is more likely to be ap-
proached you will walk on this side and
follow the beggar after he has talked with
me you will follow him and see where he
goes then you will meet me at brooklyn
bridge and tell me what you saw

   but this will prove nothing batter-
sea protested -out of the one hundred
how can i guarantee that you will meet
the ultimate one

   because you believe in miracles
wentworth said and added not without a
trace of emotion  you have put the curse
of doubt on me made me hesitate in my
conviction i will not be unnerved by your
damned sophistries i will draw strength

from the very source of my weakness-
beggardom-i will prove myself right

  battersea said no more but crossed the
street the ugliest street in the world while
wentworth strolled along casually inward-
ly cursing his friendly enemy for a fool and
himself for a weakling and while he was
walking along he saw a man approach him
dressed in the uniform of a railway engi-
neer instinctively he realized that the fel-
low was  sizing him up and  he is
going to beg from me he said to himself
jubilantly

   now we shall see he thought across
the way he saw battersea watching him

   havent had anything to eat in three
days the man mumbled his uniform
was dreadfully soiled and ragged his face
pale and his eyes-the whites of them at
least-almost red his shoes were badly
torn

   nothing to eat in three days he re-
peated and perhaps taking courage from
wentworths immobility he added quickly

   came from chicago-bummed my way
here-cant get a job yet-get one in the
morning over at the yards-promised me-
need money for supper and sleeping-just
that-

   not an original beggar wentworth
thought swiftly-  the usual story he
stood there his figure and features rigid
while the beggar waited in hope and de-
spair a comic tragedian in the cosmic
drama

   i will tell you something wentworth
said in a voice as clear as it was sharp-
without seeming brutal or censorious

    i have here every penny i have in the
world and his voice became vibrant and
intense as he displayed the seven dollars
which he had drawn from his pocket the
beggar drew back suspiciously and anx-
iously

   every penny i have in the world
wentworth repeated moodily listen

   you have just told me you havent
eaten in three days i have just eaten
you have just told me you havent
a cent i have seven dollars - and
a family you havent a job neither
have  as it stands i am seven dollars and
a family to the good but something may


argosy and railroad mans magazine

turn up for me now you know what this
money means to me you know how much
it means to me his voice rose honestly
and intensively  listen

   if you still say you are starving and
need money for supper-and not for liquor
-i will give you one of these seven dol-
lars

  the beggar had grown more and more
amazed as wentworth proceeded now he
stood mute and scanned the dress of the
awful philanthropist but in the darkness
and because of the dark texture of went-
worths suit he could judge nothing then
he lifted up his eyes to wentworths

   i have said that the latter had the strange
and icy faculty of making himself inscruta-
ble he could indeed mobilize in his eyes
every aspect of limbo but it was other-
wise now he was not inscrutable his
eyes were bright and open and candid-and
truthful

   i lied said the beggar  keep your
money i lied before wentworth had
altered his position he was gone ambling
and almost staggering along the street it
had not occurred to wentworth that the
man was drunk

  he walked slowly to the bridge first mo-
tioning battersea to follow the beggar for
he scarcely knew whether the affair was a
victory for himself or for his opponent
 the fellow was drunk he said to himself
uneasily and stood waiting for battersea
what can be keeping him he thought
after the hour had added thirty minutes to
eternity

   hell youve been long he said when
battersea arrived out of breath and pale
what kept you he added vexedly

   give me some money battersea said
wentworth looked at him then took out a
wallet filled with bills and said shortly
 how much

   twenty or thirty battersea said brisk-
ly wentworth gave it to him merely say-
ing  what became of all of your money
 that was an awful case battersea
answered irrelevantly  i gave the fellow
all the money i had with me

   you did what wentworths voice rose
almost to a scream  he was drunk

   drunk cried battersea  drunk
you fool he fainted - the ambulance
doctor said - from starvation drunk
the man was starving

t tp in the orchard a robin
is telling a tale-

        hear how he chuckles the laughter

         is almost a gale

        down in the meadow a brooklet
        is humming along

busily working hes finding
theres time for a song

        gay through the maples a zephyr
        a child-wind you know
        startles the leaves in his playing
        and laughs from below

         often i think as i listen
         that we are alone
         glum in a world where laughter
         is everywhere known

just fifty-three years ago that is to say on april   at decatur illinois was
formed an organization whose numbers are now pitifully few indeed no longer
does one hear at parades-as i did some twenty years ago- oh come we
neednt wait any longer its only the grand army of the republic for someway
somehow the sentiment attaching to those veterans of the civil war as they filed past
rank after rank in their faded blue uniforms seemed to have flickered out is it true
that after all republics are ungrateful there is now a movement on foot to create a
body of american veterans of the world war and thus perpetuate the memories of the
greatest fight for high ideals that was ever waged will these too i wonder be treated
with the same contemptuous disdain as the years go by and shall they have to wait
until their numbers thin and there are only a handful of survivors to hobble along on
november  to be greeted with the ringing cheers that are showered on the few blue-
coated marchers in the decoration day parades of to-day no men deserve more of
their country than those who have risked their lives for it and its gratitude should
never die

a clash of identities

by harry stephen keeler

a three-part serial beginning in the argosy for april  features every quality to
make a story interesting-suspense characterization problem ward shadows sixty-
eight cents represented his entire worldly wealth-not a particularly weighty sum with
which to fight lifes battle youll say but-well from the moment of his meeting with
the mysterious belzar events began to happen with the speed clutch thrown into high
and at the driving finish it was at last given to him to see himself as others saw him-
to acquire and hold a treasure that was indeed gold even if it could not be measured in
pounds or rupees for instance or mohurs or dollars and cents

unique in its way as is the story itself this is a complete novelette in the argosy
for april 		j	j

     money is invariably interesting not only to have in ones purse but to read about
money in large quantities figures in engrossing fashion in one of our next weeks shorts
 it wont happen again by loring brent its an odd story as well as an
absorbing one and i shall be particularly eager to hear what you think of it in
 wise as a serpent  francis james gets away with quite a new species of de-
tective yarn and im wondering now how many of you will be able to lay your finger
on the really guilty party before you reach the exposure this country is unique in
possessing the great chain of lakes that lie to the north of the united states and
charles wesley sanders is a master-hand at serving them up as background to stirring
tales of adventure that have all the lure if not the salt tang of the sea tn  alone 
he is quite up to his best and gives you in addition a side view of human nature that

watch for a great western
tale by john frederick

	douglas arizona

  i have been thinking for over a year that i
would add a letter of appreciation to your log-
book the first copy of the argosy i remem-
ber reading was about five years ago when it
contained  the lone star ranger  and  the
last of the duanes those stories made me look
forward to the arcosy zane grey in my
opinion comes first with the western stories
following close second charles alden seltzer
with those two writers on your staff tiie argosy
will hold all who like western stories of course
i like your short stories such as mining logging

or do the three foregoing by any means
will go to make the argosy of april 
j

and ranching  square deal sanderson was
great and i appreciate your surprise in giving
 forbidden trails by seltzer sincerely yours
for western stories

                             earl v sands
          couldnt wait

eagle idaho

  it is all right that you didnt send me the
december  number because i was so interested
in the story  square deal- sanderson that i
couldnt wait for it to come so i went and got
it at a news-stand you can send me the next
two issues following

  i think your log-book is exceptionally good i
always turn to it first  do not see how some
people can find fault with the arcosy i always
like every story i suppose this letter will be
quietly laid to rest in the waste-basket

  wishing success to the arcosy i remain

san antonio texas

  i have been reading the argosy for some time
and find it the best thing yet i am still in high
school but i write short stories that are some-
times considered good do you require the au-
thors of the short stories you publish -to be ex-
perienced some one said you accepted them
from amateurs sometimes is this true i would
like to see one of mine in print please answer
my letter through the log-book wishing the
argosy the greatest of success

mildred cleveland

  we prefer to have our authors experienced and
i am sure our readers do too as i have already
stated thf argosy is not to be considered a
training-field for writers this is not to imply
the log-book



that a new author may not produce good work
we examine all stories submitted and if we find a
crackerjack are only to ready to accept and pay
for same

a joy in the family

detroit michigan

  i am enclosing ten cents in stamps for which
please send me a copy of tiie argosy for de-
cember   my wife and myself are con-
stant readers of the argosy and occasionally the
all-story weekly we both think the arcosy
is the best all-around story magazine published
i have just finished the short stories for this week
january  and think that  black pearls year
and  cuthford-soldier of the sea  were fine
i dislike to wait for each instalment of the
serials and to get around that i wait until i
have the story complete i cant name any one
story that i like any better than the rest i
think they are all just fine if i may suggest it i
think just one long complete novelette is better
than two short ones you may publish this if

  will you please send me the argosy for jan-
uary  with the conclusion of square deal
sanderson as i was sick so i missed it at the
news-stand i think that is the right date but i
am not sure i have been a reader of the argosy
for about a year and it is the best magazine out
i have tried them all but none can beat it i like
the stories by charles alden seltzer best so give
us plenty of them your short stories are first
rate so are your novelettes hoping to see this
in print i am yours for the argosy and may
it have a long life	lloyu b larsen

  in the log of march  an unfortunate typo-
graphical error announced the name of mr
seltzers next argosy hero as bean in place ot
beau rand its a great tale and when you read
it you will quickly discover that young rand is
far from being any sort of bean

no sequel to imbecile
prince 

                    e fourth

wellington kansas

  most every one writes you and makes requests
and boosts the argosy well i have read the
other fellows letters and will now send one my-
self containing a boost and a request i like your
western stories and have lived all over the south-
west so i prefer some other stories once in a
while which i get much obliged to the editor
several years ago when the arcosy and cava-
lier were what the argosy and all-story weekly
are now there was a story published called  the
prince imbecile or the  imbecile prince
would like a sequel to it or to have it repub-
lished of course we want  america first but
we like a little foreign flavor once in a while

but please leave the german flavor out as it is a
bad taste now hoping i will see this in a future
argosy i will say that i am twenty-seven and
have read the argosy and all-story weekly
magazines since i was thirteen years of age or
somewhere thereabout and there is no equal or
near equal magazine published i like all of the
stories published but give us the sequel

                       always a booster

wm allen

  p s-as i was in the army a while i missed a
few numbers so if a sequel was published let
me know when

  cowmen as they were

houston texas

  i saw a letter from douglas wyoming un-
signed in the log-book regarding the heroes of
western stories and i guess he is right about the
present cowboy though as a kid i have seen the
kind they use as types for the average westerner

  i lived in that neck of the woods and have
ridden from old fort sidney-now plain sidney
-nebraska to the powder river country in
wyoming up the north fork of the platte river
past minatare geering et cetera into the sister
slate also up the pumpkin seed creek past wild-
cat mountain into the chugwater and crazy
horse creek country of wyoming i have visited
the old p f outfit also the wendover country
and the circle arrow down by cheyenne four
years i lived at the base of the big horn in ne-
braska twenty-two miles east of the wyoming
line and knew personally old-time punchers like
charley dick pete larson known as gunny
sock pete and sheriff jeff carr of cheyenne
wyoming was my ideal of a western sheriff is
yet for that matter

  and in those days the boys wore guns and
they were not  bad men  either the guns
were usually for another purpose as any old-time
cowman will tell you why cant we have these
types drawn for us who look back upon kid days
with a fondness that grows as we grow older
stories sometimes dont suit me but as a whole
the arcosy does only i hate to think of any-
body saying  there aint no sich  horse-cars
are obsolete now but they used to was

  hoping you are not offended i am going to
admit i rather roasted an author in your sister
publication and sign myself

eveleth minnesota

  just a few lines to let you know what i think
of the argosy i have been an argosy reader
for some time and think its the best magazine
on earth i have just finished reading  square
deal sanderson it sure was great i like all
the stories both serials and short but the western
stories cannot be beaten mr editor dont you
think the arcosy would be much better if you
could keep one western serial running all the
time i am sure it would i wish the argosy
were a daily have heard much praise about
 riddle gawne by charles alden seltzer so i


argosy and railroad mans magazine

want to get that story please tell me if i can
get it and also tell me the pricc you can do this
through the log-book for  will not give my
name for the first time will tell you pay-day
when i send my four dollars to you

  now on january  i saw a letter in the log-
book from a party who said that  tessie of
rainbow glen by s w hopkins was rotten
i have read that story and didnt find any fault
with it some of your readers said it was written
for babies well im not seventeen so i guess i
am in the class with the babies yet id like to get
another story by hopkins

  well this is the first letter from eveleth al-
though i know many who read the arcosy i
get my moneys worth out of the log-book alone
i heard many of my friends say so excuse my
long letter for the first time it would take all
year to write all the praise for the argosy wish
best luck to all your authors yourself mr editor
and the famous argosy i shall be its reader until
the end if this goes in the log-book please
sign me

adic when she wrote that letter if she didnt

next seven issues ending in that for november

a canadian at white heat

vancouver british columbia

  im writing you this letter in a real  white
heat mr editor and i suppose you will get
many more like it as there will no doubt be
many people among the readers of your log-book
with a spark of good will to the brave boys of the
allies who have been fighting for us all these long
weary years all this anger has been aroused by
reading a letter in the argosy log-book last
night when  just received my copy of january
 this letter was signed  girl of the golden
west who says that she does not believe in cor-
responding with strangers and at the same time
has her letter open for millions to read now
the trouble all centers round the point that this
dear lady thinks it a breach of etiquette to checr
up a poor soldier who is giving up everything
and facing death and even worse than death

  does she ever think what it can mean to a boy
to see all his companions reading letters from
home while he alone stands with hungry starved
heart for some little token of good will from
across the seas and yet none comes a true
woman could have easily written kind words to
some boy like this and there were hundreds and
even thousands of them in the muddy rat-in-
fested trenches of flanders who would have felt
grateful we canadian girls have written to
hundreds of boys for the last four years sending
small parcels et cetera and by the letters we have
received from our boys we know they were ap-
preciated and they did not think any the less of
us for writing to  strangers we do not expect

ever to meet those boys our correspondence only
continued while those boys needed a line from
their native land of course many of them have
long since been laid to rest in some rough neglect-
ed grave but we know this much that while they
lived and suffered to keep us free from slavery 
we at least were not afraid of what mrs grundy
would say to show some motherless or friendless
boy that all women are not heartless there are
thousands of married women too in all the
countries where the allies flag waves that have
written cheerful letters to their soldier boys and
yet they are true women doing it with all the
warmth of their hearts and not with the desire
to carry on a flirtation as the letter from the
 girl of the golden west  seemed to imply

  i	am awfully sorry to rave like this to you mr
editor but honest i havent said half that was
in my heart because im afraid id write a book-
ful if i did but it hurts to think that any one
can be so narrow-minded in a case like this after
all those boys have done if that lady who has
aroused the temper under my fiery locks could see
the boys that have returned all crippled and
maimed from out of the very jaws of hell and
know that many many of her own friends would
never return and if she had brothers and rela-
tions of her own among the maimed and missing
perhaps she would have some real red blood flow
straight to her heart

  but i dont think any of our boys-tommies
sammies or jackies-who have read her letter
would ever want or cxpect one word of sympathy
from her and whats more they dont need
sympathy but they did need a letter to make
them feel they  belonged

  in passing i would like to say that i have been
a faithful reader of both the arcosy and the
all-story weekly for many years and thought
that i could pass my opinion right along with
others of your log-book readers both of those
books are dandy i like the serials as well as the
short stories might say im heartily disgusted
when i read any knocks about  this story and
that  in your books let the knocker sit down
and write a story himself and give it up to other
people to criticise and just see how pleasant it
would feel to have the  child of his brain 
picked to pieces lifes too short for knocks and
if one story doesnt appeal to his peculiar kind of
taste why turn over the page because if its an
all-story weekly or argosy there is sure to be
ten good stories for every indifferent one all
good luck to your magazine for

  my opinion publicly expressed

  is to all good magazines this goes to the best

and please forgive a  sore-headed  canuck for
taking up so much of your valuable time

                        sincerely yours

                                    v victor

  in justification of  girl of the golden west
it should be explained that the united states
government came to take her view of correspond-
ence with strangers even if the latter were in the
position of fighting for the country from which
the letters came it may be observed also that
with us no parcels were permitted to be sent to
the soldiers in france on account of the necessity
to conserve space in the ships

 as you say  cents wont scare me

a giant tube -

we have found a way to give the
million men who tame their
beards with mennens a little
more shaving cream for their money
we are now making in addition to the
 cent size a he-size portly tube with
enough cream in it to last six months

  the economy of it works out this way
one big empty tube of pure tin costs less
than two small tubes if pure tin goes
any higher theyll be making jewelry of
it a big tube can be filled packed
labelled and sold for almost the same
labor cost as a small tube-or for much
less than the cost of two small tubes

  these several savings pay for quite a
lot of extra cream the big tube holds
more in proportion to its cost than the
regular  cent tube

  of course you can buy the  cent
size and get good value for your money
but when you wrap your fingers around
this   centimeter  new tube of ours
youll know you are getting your
moneys worth-plus

learn paragon

shorthandin  day

 study it for one week free at
 our expense-send no money

  here is a shorthand that people in
all walks of life may learn with amaz-
ing ease and write with extraordinary
facility it is paragon shorthand
-an american invention it is so
simple so easy to grasp that any-
body of average intelligence can learn
it in the evenings of a single week
and be able to read their notes per-
fectly

  frankly it does seem incredible
yet we are not asking you to take
our word for it at all we simply
ask to be allowed to send you the
complete course of paragon short-
hand and have you keep it for a week
and study it just as if it were your
own then if you are not con-
vinced of the simplicity of this short-
hand and satisfied that you can learn
it easily we merely ask you to return
it could anything be fairer could
we do more to establish the truth of
our claims

   short simple lessons

  that is the extent of the paragon
system the lessons are so arranged
that you can complete each one in a
single evenings study to give you
an idea of its brevity and simplicity
so that you can appreciate why it can
be mastered so quickly realize that
the entire system consists of tho
paragon alphabet  simple word-signs
 prefix contractions and i general rule
for abbreviations that is all

  this is a decided contrast to the
ponderously technical and involved old-
time systems with their intricacies
of shading position k or more
word-signs and maze of rules to
memorize no wonder it takes months
of weary study to master them in
paragon this is all eliminated you
have very little to commit to memory
that is why it is learned so easily
and quickly at the end of a week
you begin speed practice if it is your
intention to qualify for a stenographic
position otherwise you can begin
using your newly acquired knowledge
at once

shorthand-its possibilities

  the world is full of examples of
what a shorthand writer can rise to
beyond stenography young people be-
ginning in business as stenographers

soon learn the details of the business
they are in-how it is conducted-the
firms policy-special conditions in the
trade-trade secrets prices discounts
and the most vital things concerning
that business all of these things are
dictated to you this in itself forms
the basis of valuable experience in
shaping the course of young men and
women looking forward to business
careers and when vacancies occur
you are the logical candidate for pro-
motion to a more responsible and
better-paving position because of your
intimate knowledge of the business

  that is how many of the biggest
business men and women in america
made their start prominent among
those who began as stenographers are

everybodys property now

  the usefulness of shorthand until
recent years has been restricted
chiefly to court reporters and business
stenographers for the reason that it
was too difficult for the average per-
son to master it remained for
paragon shorthand to brinp this
valuable knowledge into universal use
-for everybody people now in all
walks of life use it executives and
their subordinates merchants and

better than a
mustard plaster

   once when grandmas joints
  commenced to ache and
  twinge she used to go to the
  mustard pot and make a mus-
  tard plaster now she goes
  to musterole and gets relief
  but does without the blister
  and the plaster too 

  my how good that
 musterole feels when you rub
 it in gently over that lame
 back and those sore muscles
 first you feel the gentle tingle
 then the delightful soothing
 coolness that reaches in the
 twinging joints or stiff sore
 muscles

    it penetrates to the heart of the
  congestion this is because it is
  made of oil of mustard and other
  home simples and the heat gen-
  erated by musterole will not blister

    on the contrary the peculiarity
  of musterole lies in the fact that
  shortly it gives you such a cool
  relieved feeling all about the
  twingey part

    and musterole usually brings
  the relief while you are rubbing it
  on always keep a jar handy

many doctors and nurses recommend musterole
