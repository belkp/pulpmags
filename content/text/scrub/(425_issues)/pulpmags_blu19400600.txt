instruction on the copy-desk method it starts and keeps you
writing in your own home on your own time and upon the

itan reporters thus you learn by doing not by studying the

newspaper men gradually they help to clarify your own dis-
tinctive style writing soon becomes easy absorbing profitable

      ettleman took me home
      with him to see a suppressed
      film

        one of the great hollywood
directors kettleman is a queer genius ex-
perimenting in queer directions to all
the accusations and criticisms hurled at
the movies he has one very true answer
we make what we must since ninety
per cent of the public ignore intelligent
pictures as they ignore great symphonies
we give em what they demand

  that answer i told him is perfect-
ly true but it is not the truth at all

  he grinned faintly i guess so its
a good excuse for making damfool pic-

tures that are slipshod historically in-
correct and so forth the one im going
to show you is part of an educational pro-
gram i dreamed of turning out

  why was it suppressed sex
heavens no h rejoined it was
to be a panorama of i he theater in techni-
color but that fellow donald up in the
studio finally junked the idea he claims
people arent interested in anything about
the theater that they want blood ro-
mance action funny thing is this pic-
ture has all of these-and something
more it deals with he survival of acting
and the stage in the darkest medieval
ages donald saw only the opening a

a dreadful and beautiful story of the
dark ages-the third in the series
the world was their stage

by h bedford-jones

vista of hilltops in normandy and turned
thumbs down without seeing the rest

  nothing very dramatic about hill-
tops i commented

  the greatest drama in all history was
played on a hilltop outside jerusalem
he snapped i told you the man was sin-
gular  his mental flashes were- always at
an angle somehow

  kettleman had a private projection-
room in his big house he took me in
supplied a drink and a cigar and began
to fuss with his projector the room
lights flicked off on the screen facing us
appeared a still in technicolor a land-
scape aglow beneath a round silvern disk
which in another night would be the
fullest of full moons a landscape a hill-
top interspersed with huge jagged bits of
rock in the distancea castle tower and
the glint of water

 hang it the projectors stuck-
have it fixed in a minute said kettle-
man a curious fact the earliest french
mystery plays went by the name of puy
why  because the word signified a hill-
top it was a reminiscence of earlier
dramas back in pagan ages here you see
a hilltop in brittany by the sea in feudal
days of blood and fire and universal war
when the drama was preserved in the
hearts of common folk as a joyous relief
from the horrors of an intolerable exist-
ence

  i didnt know there was any drama
fchen was my comment

  the dance of life the most ancient
of all pageants that of fertility the earth-
mother an old pagan survival then
remember the people were oppressed and
ground down and trodden underfoot like
weeds by their lords and masters the


a kindly soul with a heart for the maids who
were sport for soldier and noliie

people of the earth were like wild beasts
in that period

  that same period i objected gave
us the most glorious of romances-look at
the story of tristan and yseult

  bah look at the story of jehan and
elaine  he barked the machine began
to click the film moved the scene
moved needless to say it was a sound-
film	

  yet for a space there was no sound
the figure of a woman a girl appeared
like a wood-nymph girt with fluttering
moon-glints and garlanded with pearls
her figure grew more clear she was ac-
tually clad in rags and tatters twined in

her flowing red-gold hair were flowers
she moved with such symmetry such
utter grace as apparently to mount upon
the very moonbeams

  dancing about those jagged ancient
stones approaching the flat central rock
she came to sudden frightened halt she
stood at gaze transfixed the high white
moon etched her lisfome shape her mass-
es of flower-starred hair her profile of
purest beauty and nobility behind her
evident terror was a nervous strength
one sensed in her a singular desperate
courage as though she were faced by
some unavoidable terror and yet fronted
it with heart unquailing


  no no a gfsp broke from her
you are dead-it cannot be you-
from the central mass of rock a shad-
ow detached itself stood out clearly and
came toward her the girls fright died
an incredulous cry cf joy broke upon her
lips and her arms lifted eagerly

 jehan dear jehan-youre real
alive flesh and blood  

  and can prove it elaine  said he as
his arms went about her they clung to-
gether wordless lip to lip and heart to
heart

  they said you were dead she mur-
mured all the village thinks you dead
your poor mother died last month and
i-i have had no heart left

 he was a young man but shaggily
bearded clad in ragged garments marked
by hard travel and pivation unlike the
average peasant there was no cringing in
his manner he held his head high and
the harsh lines of his features held a reso-
lute indomitable expression rarely found
among the people of the earth as they
stood together he turned the girl and
pointed to the distart mass of the castle

  and they think me dead also he said
a bitter menace in his voice the noble
lord of fecamp his slender voluptuous
ladies his knights and men-at-arms-
aye they think me dead here little
heart sit down and rest while i tell you
about it

  he drew her down on the great flat
rock where in olden days the druids had
performed their mystic rites she nestled
beside him tremulous still incredulous of
his reality

  you know how my sister was taken to
the castle yonder and how she killed her-
self after the lord of fecamp had finished
with her and gave her to his soldiers he
said you know how i cursed them
how they came and seized me and took
me to the castle there they whipped me
and loaded chains or me and made me a
beast of burden

  the girl shivered and touched his
cheek with pitying fi nger yet there was
nothing unusual in all this the serfs of
chivalry were born to such a destiny

an english knight visited the castle
i two months ago he went on he
won me at dice from the lord of fecamp
and took me when he left for england
the ship was wrecked on the coast below
here for a storm seized us most of those
on board were drowned only a few es-
caped to tell of it so i was accounted
dead with the rest

   we heard murmured elaine they
 mourned for the english knight

   jehan laughed harshly he did not
 drown i killed him took his money and
 clothes and got ashore elaine its
 wealth money real money of silver and
 gold clothes arms all hidden and wait-
 ing for us i came to take you away from
 this horror to the country of eldigonde
 the sorceress

    the girl lifted herself and drew back
 horrified

   jehan are you mad  poor jehan
 -you have suffered-

 he broke into a swift joyous laugh
 and kissed her strong fingers

    no no im quite sane my dear far
 below here on the breton coast is a land
 of safety for you and me the country is
 wild densely wooded a tangle of rocks
 and trees no feudal lords own it in-
 stead its inhabited by free people of the
 earth who have fled there in that wild
 land they live safely freely joyously
 and the wise old woman the sorceress
 eldigonde is the only ruler for her wis-
 dom is great all the wealth for which i
 paid in blood and flesh and tears is wait-
 ing there i came to take you back with
 me a boat is hidden here at the shore
 below the castle youll go

   yes yes it seems like some dream
 jehan-yes of course ill go she ex-
 claimed in stammering haste i cant
 believe its real but jehan i cant
 leave until after tomorrow night it is
 the festival you know the dance of life
 he nodded aye the dance of life
 that we celebrate in secret to the moon 
 and god help us all if they find out about
 it there at the castle you remember
 how the sieur de courcelles burned
 eleven of his people alive three years ago
 for celebrating the festival 

    theres no danger here jehan said
 the girl everybody at the castle will be
 drunk tomorrow night the lord of fe-
 camp is to celebrate his birthday and has
 invited a crowd of gentry in besides
 felipe brieux will be ready to touch off
 a signal-flare if theres any riding from
 the castle no its safe

   and you my dear jehan stroked
 her glossy hair do you still wear the
 hump on your back and the scar on your
 facethat nanny dubois taught you to
 paint on 

she shivered slightly yes of course
marie lianceau was married last week to
pierre and he had to take her to the
castle for-the droit de seigneur oh

i-i am only a peasant
messire pierre she said
i am no lovely lady

jehan it was terrible she was out of
her senses for two days afterward two
of the castle officers were riding by the
field where i was working and saw me
and came over for a closer look luckily
they saw the scar and the humped back
and went away but i was frightened
may heaven blast all these rulers of
earth  cried out jehan passionately
he launched a torrent of curses in a
blaze of shaking wrath these lords and
seigneurs who oppress and torture us
who own us body and soul-some day
theyll be swept away their castles
will be razed they and their brood
drowned in their own blood-youll see
hush jehan theyd hang you for
saying such words 

  he laughed bitterly ill say worse
before im dead but now little heart i
must get away and find hiding over to-
morrow  i dare not let another soul know
im back i did hope to see my old
mother but you say shes dead so let it
pass shes resting at last poor soul
ill meet you here tomorrow night after
the festival then well go quickly
with all my heart jehan she replied
one last embrace one clinging eager kiss
of rapture and he was gone melting into
the shadows whence he had come

  and high time as the girl stood star-
ing after him a scuffle of sabots and the
murmur of voices reached her a dozen
other girls of the village and district
around had arrived to join her in a re-
hearsal of the dance

  they greeted her joyously half fear-
fully all in a tumult between terror and
excited anticipation there was one screw-
backed old hag from down the shore who
hobbled along importantly it was her
place to see that the ancient ritual was
followed the dances and the songs rightly
given for thus they had been handed
down from forgotten days

  so laying off the wooden sabots the
girls circled and sang postured and
tripped among the rocks that the forgot-
ten druids haaleft behind all was done
blindly in passive obedience to the
croaked directions of  he old hag she her-
self did not know the meaning of the
words uttered for to her they were only
sounds just as the gestures and actions
were meaningless things relics of the dim
past

  but luck followed upon the festival
when it was neglected pestilence and
bad crops came and war the old gods
were forgot their very names blown no-
where with the dust of centuries their
fanes all crumbled and their memories
grown black beneath the stars but racial
instinct still preserved the rites of ancient
days to these poor folk crushed under
such oppression as the world has seldom
seen this yearly festival was a symbol cjf
hope and beauty an escape from the
horrors of daily life a prayer half-rea-
lized to the primal earth-gods and the
forces of nature

  none the less it constituted a fearful
risk in the eyes of chivalry they had
no right to happiness woe betide them if
they were caught at it then would
rise the cry of sorcery with tortures
and burnings and mutilation to follow
the black death and other fearful
plagues had not yet come to sweep away
nine-tenths of all people rich and poor
alike and make human chattels valuable
the land was crowded serfs were thick
in field and village to be mauled or killed
or hunted down like wild beasts in drunk-
en riot

late under the moon elaine stole home
j to the thatched cottage still in a fer-
vent riot of thought and tucked herself
away weary as she was sleep came hard
jehan alive here within reach and touch
this in itself was a miracle but what
lay beyond seemed utterly incredible
that there should be any place beyond
the reach of tyrannj- and cruelty was to
her a fantastic vision beyond the power
of the brain to comprehend yet jehan
had come to take her there 


    if indeed it were ill real and not a
  dream she awakened in the morning
  suddenly to clasp hands to bursting heart
  true or real she could not credit it
  until she found on her finger the circlet
  of gold jehan had pui there at parting
  a gold ring she stared at it then hur-
  riedly tore it off and hid it from sight
  there was no such treasure as that any-
  where inthe district only a knight might
  hope to possess a gold ring or one of the
  pretty beauties at the castle

  t tp slut up came the voice of her
  bent and twisted father roaring
  angrily our lords overseer has com-
  manded that the entire upper field be fin-
  ished today-up and out 

    elaine had scant love for her father
  who viewed her innate delicacy with
  sneering derision he was a brute like
  most of his kind warped by hard labor
  and torments perhaps there was truth
  in the story that she sprang not from
  him but from that night when her
  mother a bride was handed over to the
   lord of fecamp this right had in-
  stilled new blood in many a peasant
  family and amid the cringing tortured
  serfs was to be seen many a head held
  proudly such as that of elaine or of her
  lover jehan

    she dressed swiftly her father looked
  on with an evil grin while she donned the
  false hump she had invented for safetys
  sake tying the straps over her shoulders
  and below the budding round of her
  breasts over this her ragged robe then
  while he taunted her about the good
  price he should get for betrayal of her
  ruse she swiftly applied the magical
  paint nanny dubois had given her mak-
  ing a red ugly scar that drew her cheek
  and lips askew a kindly soul old
  nanny with a heart in her shriveled
  deathly corpse for the poor maids who
  were sport for soldier and noble

    a swallow of thick so ap a rush for the
  field and the work was forward with
  clump of wooden shoe and drip of sweat
  and many a groan for aching back and
  loins

    today however aches and pains were
  forgotten in the glorious vista that
  spelled an end to barbarous oppression
  freedom and safety it seemed too
  good to be true in this nightmare of a life

    afternoon brought guttural cries of
  warning flitting across the fields from
  hovel to hovel armed men were riding
  from the castle i they came-the seig-
  neur himself a band of visiting knights

v	eeress neither

 and lords ladies on their palfreys men-
 at-arms in helm and chain-coat pennons
 flashing and gay laughter ringing as the
 dun deer fled before and the horns
 sounded high a stag broke from covert
 and fled across the field of springing
 grain with shout and horn the riders
 plunged after hounds baying wildly it
 was the natal day of the lord of fe-
 camp with a stag of ten hurtling to the
 kill

 elaine ran with the others all scurry-
 ing like frightened quail as the rout
 headed for them she saw her father
 trip and fall the dogs went over him
 in a rush but one of them turned to
 spring at him struggling up he fought
 the beast frantically with a torrent of
 oaths the seigneur himself rode down the
 panic-stricken man lashed him with a
 whip and sent the men-at-arms to finish
 him a lance went through him and
 another the twisted body relaxed and
 the laughing ladies kneaded it into the
 mud as they galloped over the poor clay

   two of the castle riders wheeled their
 horses as elaine ran screaming to the
 side of the dead man they reined in
 laughing but as they sighted her scarred
 face and the hump between her shoulders
 they put in spurs and went on at a gallop
 with a coarse exchange of jests the
 other folk crept out from hiding and bore
 the spattered corpse home

   lucky they didnt take a notion to
 ride all of us down said somebody
the blue book magazine

  grief elaine felt none pretended
none this father of hers had been her
chief potential enemy in fact now she
was alone but not for long tonight
would end all of that forever so her
father was laid under the earth before
the grave was filled the castle overseer
arrived and gave orders that she was to
marry a widower of the district on the
morrow hump or no hump she could
breed new serfs to labor in the fields

  and he added with a laugh as he
departed when the ceremonys done
youll go up to the castle for the usual
entertainment youre no proper quarry
for the seigneur my lass but the men-at-
arms are not over-particular

  elaine assented humbly and repressed
a shudder what if jehan had not come
back last night fate would have been
hard at her heels

the long afternoon dwindled into sun-
set and she ate a lone supper and
thought of jehan hiding somewhere along
the rocky shore her fathers death would
make no difference to the celebration of
the festival the dance of life was some-
thing that rose above mortality and
human chance

  with darkness there was a hush and a
stir over the whole countryside from
near and far shadowy figures were steal-
ing along the winding roads and across
the fields toward the hilltop where the
ancient rocks thrust up toward the stars

  in the vague starlight they wended
toward their goal slipping from bosque
and covert to converge on the one point
silently enough like animals only now
and again a clucking of tongues sounded
as crones and wise women from scattered
points came together old outcast hags
like nanny dubois who practiced wiz-
ardry of nights and brewed herbs to
make the sick well and afforded the poor
folk shrewd but subtle advice in all prob-
lems of their wretched lives

  on the hilltop along the hill flanks
dim serried ranks of half-seen figures
gathered they waited tense expectant
they had stolen away for this one night
of freedom and joyous celebration in se-
cret grouped beside one of the great
rocks elaine and her companions bided
motionless the moment of their appear-
ance for other things came first

  the first orange light of the rising
moon trembled up the eastern sky from
all that assemblage came a murmurous
gasp of greeting a breath that passed
along the hillside and died into silence

shapes appeared in the dim slowly grow-
ing glow capering amid the high rocks
grotesque shapes clad in the guise of wild
beasts

  the dance of life had begun

  it was an eerie uncanny thing for as
yet the golden round of the moon was not
up monstrous shapes disported them-
selves masques of wicker and fur which
had been long weeks preparing in hidden
places all was done in silence save for
hoarse breaths and pantings of effort
closer to the great central stone worked
the rhythmic movement until as the cir-
cle of the moon lifted gradually all that
wild company stood revealed for one mo-
ment full-etched in horn and hoof and
claw and bestial ecstasy

  the shrill note of a reed pipe sounded
suddenly and completely the strange
figures separated leaped away and scur-
ried into cover they vanished and in
among the rocks came men clad in skins
to the thin tremulous music of many reed
pipes dancing and weaving in upon the
flat central stone

  they carried burdens images of ani-
mals  in olden days no doubt these had
been real animals for sacrifice but now
the creatures of earth and sea were too
hard to come by  utterly valuably for
such offering upon the flat rock were
laid the simulated fish and beasts while
the dancers went through the olden ritual
of oblation and festival it was a strange-
ly wild and vivacious thing to see and
mightily stirred the hearts of the watch-
ers so that ejaculations and eager voices
began to rise on all sides

everywhere the grain was spring-
ing in the sown fields life was stirring
anew in leaf and beast and here beneath
the moon was the festival of fertile earth
and joy the men drew back the thin
pipings changed to a different air elaine
sped a quick wcrd at her companions
and the tattered gowns were flung aside
she leaped forth and they after her
clad in little besides the flowing disarray
of floating hair and twisted ropes of
flowers

  what a dance this was beneath the
flooding golden light of the risen moon
the slim figures swept among the old
monoliths in steps of wild abandon mur-
murs of amazement sounded as elaine
was recognized now without hump or
scar slender and perfect and lovely a
miracle a miracle  swept the murmured
words but she heard them not nor cared
for somewhere in the outer darkness
the dance of life

she knew that jehan watched hidden
and she flung herself into the jocund ex-
hilaration of the piping music and the
floating steps

  the steps quickened  the music quick-
ened as the dancers neared the central
stone their lissome shapes transfigured
by the moonlight and lifted afar from
everyday semblance never had those
drear-eyed watchers beheld such grace
and beauty except at this annual festi-
val  as the reedy pipings struck into
swifter rhythm as the voices of the danc-
ing girls took up the ritual of strange un-
known words the men dancers joined in

and suddenly all was a wild ecstatic
 rapture the dancers bursting into
evasion and pursuit among the jutting
rocks the watching throngs swept by a
contagious frenzy into hoarse cries and
panting exclamations - until without
warning a fearful frozen silence struck
them all

  one wild and terrible scream from the
moonlit spaces beyond the hilltop wailed
across the night and wes followed by the
blare of a hunting horn

  the awful realization smote one and
all s a rushing clatter of hooves sound-
ed the watcher had failed the castle
folk had surprised the festival shrill
and despairing shrieks flared up to be
drowned in a roar of shouts and clarion
cries the phantom watching figures
melted like mist as knights and men-at-
arms came charging with glint of mail
and flutter of pennon and thrust of red-
tipped lance

  kill  rose the shout kill sorcery
-kill

  there was killing enough without
mercy amid frantic fleeing and mad pur-
suit old nanny dubo s was plucked up
bodily by a spear and hurled atop one of
the jagged rocks to shriek away her life
swords glinted  horses trampled

  but the little group of girls shimmer-
ing golden in the moonlightcould not
flee for the circle of armed men had
ringed in the hilltop ar d came plunging
at them with wild fierce laughter and
eager hands hither and yon they drove
in terrified flight to be run down or
pulled down by knight or squire among
the druidic stones

  elaine crouching in blank panic was
aware of a wild ringing voice above her
a man stooping from the saddle his arm
circling her body she was lifted scooped
up held in an iron grip despite all strug-
gles while the rider with a voice tri-

  umphant thrust in his spurs and sent the
  powerful destrier plunging down the hill-
  side and away through the silvery blood-
  smeared moonlit night

    the stark cries lessened the roaring
  laughter died away upon distance the
  great steed slowed his pace and halted
  the rider holding her in his arms leaned
  forward and kissed her and looked laugh-
  ingly into her face and then looked again
  his hot mirth dying out

     and she staring up helplessly saw that
  he was a stranger a young knight hand-
  some as a god no doubt one of the
  seigneurs guests there was no cruelty
  in his face no barbaric fury instead he
  seemed gentle and bright with youth

    what  he exclaimed heres a
  prize if ever was one but not what i
  thought youre no peasant lass nor any
  sorceress neither that is unless im
  bewitched myself

    have mercy have mercy  her voice
  fluttered at him wildly ive done no
  wrong-let me go i pray

    he caught sight of the golden ring
  which she had put on her finger the
  soft moonlight concealed her work-hard-
  ened hands and feet she lay in his arms
  her flower-starred hair flowing about him
  her heart palpitating against his own her
  warm fresh loveliness all real and glow-
  ing

    maiden who are you  he demanded
  curiously some sweet naiad from the
  land of prester john  some nymph crept
  out of the sea to dazzle men with her
  beauty  perhaps the lady morgana her-
  self come from the morning star to find
  a lover among men  quick your
  name 

     elaine she gasped out her eyes wide
  upon his smiling features and glorious
  youth she had never dreamed a man
  could be so nobly handsome

    elaine a name of poesy of old
  romance  he said and suddenly gripped
  her hard and kissed her lips they were
  not brutal kisses but most sweet and
  lingering so that the terrified heart with-
  in her melted and a silver fire like moon-
  light coursed through her veins then
  his head lifted  

       ome sweet lady your promise  he
  said breathing hard as he looked in-
  to her eyes i am pierre de louhac your
  very humble servitor and liege knight for
  my sins i am a poet with a lute at my
  saddle-bow where a helm should ride
  promise me that youll not fly away upon
  the moonbeams or glide into the water or
  
vanish in the thicket-swear it by the
true cross then ill set you down and
if we kiss again it shall be of your own
free will

  i swear it i swear it she panted
desperately

  he gently let her slide to earth and dis-
mounting took the cloak from his shoul-
ders and fastened it about her throat so
that it enfolded her slim body and he
sighed a little as he stooped and kissed
her hand

  now for my lute and you shall tell
me whence you came lady elaine for
i wot well you are no mortal creature
but some lovely lady come from the
bounds of fairyland even though you
be some fair sorceress-but that cannot
be since you swore by the cross there-
fore you must be all gentle and lovely as
you look since it is impossible that so
rare an ornament of heaven itself could
have sprung from earthly stock

  she stood trembling knowing too well
alas that she was no fine lady at all but
a poor humble peasant girl with a fate
worse than death awaiting her in the
seigneurs castle

  they were in a craggy desolate spot
above the shore a lonely place with the
world shut out and only the silvern mead-
ows of the sea sparkling away below she
watched with eyes of wonder as pierre de
louhac loosed a lute from his saddle
bow and the great horse arched its heavy
neck and muzzled him lovingly she did
not know that man and beast could feel
love and friendship she had not known
that any belted knight born to oppress
and rule and kill could be so gentle as
this man before her

  be seated sweet lady he exclaimed
smiling at her as he strummed upon the
lute how beautiful you are with flow-
ers in your hair and your eyes like two
stars come sit on this high rock look-
ing toward the sea 

  she complied not certain whether he
were a bit insane or playing some cruel
jest or just what he seemed soon how-
ever she perceived that there was no
guile in him and no cruelty at all

i have come from the south lady
 elaine he said where the wine and
the heart is sunny where people of the
earth are not slaves but free i rode with
the lord of fecamp tonight to the hunt
little dreaming that the hunting was of
poor folk making merry no blood is on
my hands this tlight but when i saw you
destiny came upon hie and i knew that

i pierre de louhac had been fated to
capture some sweet queen from the land
of the fays and so i took you

  she comprehended his compassion his
youthful fervent ardor his imagination
and she held forlh her hands to him
smiling faintly the music of his voice
was wondrous to hear and there was
naught to fear from him

  i-i am only a peasant messire
pierre she said t am no lovely lady
he laughed aloud

onsense when did a peasant
lass wear a golden ring when did
ever a peasant have such beauty beyond
the world as yours he swung a hand
toward the far-glinting sea look out
yonder lady elaine and tell me whence
you came from some far land of ly-
onesse it may be or from a palace glori-
ous on some far mountain crest or did
the dancing moonbeams bring you from
heaven itself to delight the hearts of
men

  under his glowing words something of
the rapt ecstasy of that hilltop dance so
terribly checked crept back into her
heart she laughedj and shook back her
hair when a flower fell he caught it up
and crushed it against his lips 

  a song for a lower then and per-
chance another kiss to make you mortal
maid said he gayly and fingering the
lute struck into song

  what he sang she knew not for the
words were strange but she nestled in
the warm cloak and gave herself up to
enchantment and drearrt as his voice rose
in golden glory

  dream enchantment she knew it
could not last and abandoned herself to
the moment with a surge of venture au-
dacious the frightful vision of nanny
dubois writhing and dying upon the high
rock died away to her lips came all the
old stories of elves and sprites of mer-
maids from the sea and the gently-ca-
ressing nymphs iri forest depths as she
murmured of these things pierre de
louhac listened entranced

  it is like the tale of tristan who died
so happily for fair yseult  he exclaimed
you came to me tonight sweet elaine
like a benison to heal inward hurts all
this land is adrift with evil and dark
cruel things and the only sure kind
touch from any hand is that of death
look tonight i was in sorrow and won-
der that such things could be and you
have made all life bright for me what
was the dance we interrupted 


thus he cried sweeping the strings and thus a salute to lire i
a salute to life and love and ecstasy

  the dance of life she said i know
not what it means for it has come down
from olden times but that is the name
given to it the dance of joyous life and
hope and springing leaves and fertile
fields

  kiss me he said looking up at her
a glow in his face  kiss me and then
dance for me alone-just a step or two
throw aside the cloak and dance

  she leaned forward her white arms
found him and her lips again that
wondrous singing fire coursed through her

veins and springing suddenly upright
she let fall the cloak and danced with a
burst of heedless happy rejoicing she
danced as never before in glorious aban-
don-and suddenly caught up the cloak
laughing and whirled it around her body

  ah to die upon such loveliness 
sighed pierre de louhac with the look of
one rapt in dream you are my captive
fair elaine but i am yours a thousand-
fold will you ride with me

  ride with you she stood staring
brought back to earth whither 
the blue book magazine

  across the world  laughing he flung
out a hand mount and ride you
shall be my lady fair clothed in silks
and satins and jewels i will ever be your
true and loyal knight singing your prais-
es under every roof we reach well go
to the lord of fecamps castle here and
now and ill uphold you as queen of
beauty

  no no she shrank that name
abruptly broke the charm the thought of
that castled keep of terror and doom
oh you are mad and im mad to let
you bewitch me

  she crumpled in a flood of tears

he not knowing all that lay in her
heart was bewildered and all astray
he could not know that she was in tears
for her friends and companions the girls
who had danced now taken to the castle
and jehan far-wandering in the night
lost and desolate or perchance dead

  perplexed he touched his lute and
sang a plaintive tender little song that
went straight into her heart her sobs
quieted presently her head lifted and
she spoke to the youth very sweetly and
sadly

  dear messire pierre i must tell you
the whole truth i am no lovely lady from
sea or moonbeam land i am just elaine
a serf of the lord of fecamp a laborer
in his fields a chattel of his hand to-
night was the festival and we who
danced were his serfs you saved me
from those wolves and i am grateful
but now mount your horse and ride away
you know the truth it is a sad and
sordid truth and all your dreams are
nothing i am a peasant and you are a
knight and the little play is ended ride
away and scorn me

  pierre de louhac stood up and smote
his lute joyously

  not so by the loving wounds of
god  he said with earnest impetuous
words gentle lady that man is lonely
and desolate and old who looks upon life
with bitter disillusioned eyes and sees
things at their worst may the blessed
saints preserve me from being such
your loveliness is the most rare and beau-
tiful thing i have found in this life of
evil you are elaine from across the sea
and i shall hold you so until i die

  will you not listen to reason she
exclaimed i can never be one of your
fine ladies-

  no for you are above them all  he
broke in hotly reason  its the curse
of all mankind as you danced tonight

the dance of life so we two shall go
through the world joyous and triumph-
ant not looking with gloomy dark eyes
upon things as they are but touching
them with poesy lifting them into what
they should be when you touch my
cheek with your hand it is an angel from
heaven who comes down to inspire me to
song when you ride behind me it is all
the beauty and mirth of the world
perched at my shoulder

  but you are a poet dear pierre she
said smiling

  and you shall be one too if you love
me a little he replied

  you are like a dream she answered
you are not like ovher men i have seen

  he fell to laughing why thats love
no less ho sweet elaine youve hit
upon the very truth of life and youth
and love a kiss upon it 

  she leaned to hi n and he caught her
in his arms his finger-tips caressing her
fair body as his lips caressed hers she
clung to him yielding and abandoning
all reason in this embrace that blotted
out the whole world

  but the great horse forgotten whin-
nied shrilly in the moonlight and shook
himself with a clank of gear pierre de
louhac leaped up and caught at his lifte
laughing

  thus he cried sweeping the strings
and thus a salute to life a salute to
life and love and ecstasy there shall
be no grief and evil in the world the sun-
light shall shimmer upon every heart
you and i fair elaine shall go down to
the golden ways of r omance hand in hand
hark how good gray ramon summons
us

  indeed hearing his name the powerful
destrier shook himself again and turned
his head looking upon his master elaine
came to her feet and drawing the cloak
more closely about her shivered from
afar came a riotous blast of horns a
shrill distant sound of savage voices a
harsh clanging bell rang thinly

  something has happened she ex-
claimed in quick alarm listen its
the tocsin from the castle-something has
happened

pierre de louhac laughed aloud
aye this has happened you and i
have met he cried while his fingers
touched the lute at his breast all the
world shall ring wild peals but they have
naught to do with us ours is the dance
of life sweet elaine  let the whole dreary
earth reecho to the dance of death and
the dance of life

we shall behold it not for ours is the
springing tender blacle of green the song
in the morn the smile of the sun on the
budding earth love in the heart and a
brave salute a salute to life-

  his words ended upon a jerk that
shook his whole body

  the lute was riven asunder with a
splintering rending crack out of the
dark dusky wood close by came the ring-
ing twang of a bowstring pierre de
louhac spun around and clutched once
at the feathered shafl which stood out of
his heart and out of the riven lute he
looked at elaine and tried to speak but
no words came then he fell and she
stood in palsied stricken horror

  from the dark covert sprang a swift
lithe figure

  so youre safe elaine  it was jehan
strong and resolute n his hand a long
english bow of yew longer than himself
ive had the devils own time tracking
you here i put a shaft into that hound
of hell-aye through i he lord of fecamp
himself hear the tocsin and the horns
theyre riding and killing this night to
make up for it

  the girls lips were loosened she broke
in upon him with a long and wailing
shriek that was echojd from the rocks
an smothered by the rees and the moon-
light

  youve killed him jehan jehan
youve killed him and he was so kind
so gentle- oh it cant be true not
you jehan not you

raith you seem sorry to see me 
f said he with his quick harsh laugh

  from her lips came another cry wild
and incoherent she collapsed all of a
sudden and lay quiet in the moonlight
her bare arm protruded from the cloak
and her hand touched the dead hand of
pierre de louhac as he smiled at the
moonlight

  now heres a queer business for
you 

  and wagging his shaggy uffshorn head
jehan came forward unstrung his bow
and stood looking down at the silent
senseless girl gradually his face soft-
ened

 poor child he murmured poor
frighted hunted lass its just as well
and saves a power of trouble the boats
close by and ere dawn well be far down
the breton coast poor lass the devils
paid out and this fine noble lord is an-

other heartless tyrant gone to hell-two
in one night lucky i came along just
in time to save her from him 

  with which he went to pierre de
louhac and took everything of value
from the body then shouldering the
senseless figure of elaine with scarcely
an effort he strode across to the shadows
and plunged out of sight for a little
the crashing of brush could be heard as
he made descent to the shore and his hid-
den boat then silence

  across the silvern moonlit stage a slow
figure moved it was the massive shape
of the horse coming to the man who lay
on his back in the streaming light a
feathered shaft pinning the broken lute
to his breast upon this stage the mov-
ing figure ceased the horse stood with
head drooping its questing muzzle nudg-
ing the white still hand that would finger
the lute no more

the film had run to its end a snap
and the room lights whipped oh ket-
tleman turned to me

  like it

  of course but where does it link up
with the theater

  he waved his hands excitedly
confound it everywhere this pag-
eant or instinct from pagan days was
essentially theater it kept the stage
alive upon this pantomime mimicry and
ancient ritual was based the sense of
drama that later flowered into being
from a naked hilltop came a naked stage
which in course of time evolved painted
scenery 

  but why make a tragedy of it and kill
off the poet and dreamer

  theyre always killed in real life he
said testily you dullard couldnt you
see any symbolism in the thing

  well all i could see was that the girl
lost her vision and was carried off to ful-
fill a barbarous destiny of motherhood to
a lot of starveling brats

  isnt that the fate of every woman
he cried triumphantly and like every
woman she retained the most precious
the rarest the most beautiful thing in
life-a secret memory

  hm well maybe i admitted all
the same perhaps its just as well that
the picture was never released ideas
they say are dangerous unless explained
fully

  kettleman has not spoken to me since
that day

another story in this series the world was their stage will appear in our next issue

 if ever you have sailed these coasts
 it is quite likely you have seen that
 eastern harbor after the fury has
 passed that way how the stillness
 is unnatural and it will be some time
 before the smell of sandalwood and wine
 returns there are broken spars in the
 channel the keels of small craft up-
 ended float like strange-black chips in
 the swollen fairways still glinting with
 the green flame-points of storm per-
 haps youve seen the north point shore
 scattered with wreckage the kowloon
 sands inside rumsey rock a refuse heap
 of crippled junks fantastically torn
 apart the splintered remains of sam-
 pans spotting the foreshore where inert
 coolies lie still guarding what was once
 the whole of their earthly wealth and the
 rescue squads wandering among them in
 the quiet dusk if you have you will know
 what a south china typhoon is and you
 will understand too a junior thirds ex-
 pression of dismay when he saw that
 barque drop away from the east point
 godowns across the way from the blue

 funnel dock in tow for lye mun pass
 all chipper and neat and ready for sea

  is that fella mad he wanted to
 know tossing up his arm to point her
 out cant he read a signal flag at all 

  just as he spoke the first warning
 bomb exploded and then two more-be-
 cause the black cross was flying on black-
 head hill typhoon advancing on hong-
 kong  to the north and east a pale haze
 hung upon the land and over the shim-
 mer of blue water but the surcharge of
 excitement was plain the battlewagons
 in man-of-war row were looking to their
 ground tackle a sleek gray cruiser sig-
 nal halyards full went nervously prowl-
 ing for safer anchorage while all the
 merchantmen too c to doubling up their
 mooring-lines the high-pooped junks

the strange story of captain yardabout-typhoon sammy who
sought and defied a hurricane

by jacland marmur
went scuttering like ugly beetles for the
typhoon refuge north of the coaling cam-
ber coolies at the long ungainly sweeps
shrilly crying to each other because
the teet-kiey-the iron whirlwind-had
made his sign in the sky  

and there was that flash barque tall
 and lovely-a startling sight nowa-
days-calmly heading out for sea no
wonder the junior said what he did you
couldnt expect he would know why he
was green on the coasts of cathay and
he didnt know anything about samuel
yardabout who hunted a hurricane the
way captain ahab hun ted a white whale
all the days of his life grim captain
ahab found what he wanted because the
fever of his desire consumed him so

did mr yardabout i know because
i was there

thats why someone ought to speak
for him because he is one of us and
because such things may be so soon for-
gotten sammy yardabout believed in
the past whence great tradition comes
the good things of an ancient craft and
whatever there is of racial splendor no
matter how obscure hes the man who
keeps a flag aloft in a place of honor and
dignity because flags are not held
proudly in a wind by rope halyards
though you might easily think they are
it is really a simple thing for artillery
and modern demolition bombs such as
canton city knows today to reduce to
rubble the stoutest masonry and with
amazing ease to murder men in droves
but a racial past has deeper roots that
goes down to the obscure courage to the
quiet almost forgotten wisdom of the
dead and such things are not so easily
destroyed no matter how many bombs
are ready in a barbarian fighting-plane
marked with an empires livid circle or
with a crooked cross if sammy yard-
about could stare a typhoon in the eye

youd bo surprised sir
lo told me youd be sur-
prised what men can do
do you suppose a bomb would ever bother
him 

  this isnt to say he looked heroic he
didnt not ever he never wore a uni-
form contending with his enemy he
never took a heros stance picturesquely
calling men to follow him into battle-
smoke for phony glory or a mutilated
death his struggle was in solitude be-
causeit was authentic he thought of it
as purely personal a matter strictly be-
tween himself and his own particular
god but about that alone he was wrong
it had to do with all of us who make
bread upon the oceans wastes where the
great gales often blow i suppose thats
why an old china hand like sammy was
such a prime joke along the coasts men
vaguely recognized themselves in him
so thats just what he was a damn
sailors joke-sammy and that typhoon
he was always looking for

  everybody knew about him in those
days and of course everybody laughed
from the sunda strait far away to the
south in all the exotic little harbors in-
denting the malay shore all along the
coasts of china-land and clear over to the
crazy trading-ports inside of palawan
that jest was known and relished by men
who followed the sea some grizzled
skipper out of the sulus his gaunt face
as brown as the mahogany logs tiered un-
der chains along his schooners deck
would sigh a tremendous sigh of relief
when his glass showed signs of rising to
give him some hope the fury meant to
pass him by unharmed this time hed
be squinting to windward where the cir-
rus was breaking up watching the huge
unhurried swells pour in a wine-dark
flood under his ship to curl away beyond
giving a loud slap to his shortened can-
vas and a rolling shove to the hull beneath
his feet that way hed stand for a min-
ute on his poop feeling profound relief

  now if typhoon sammy was here
hed tell his mate hed be cursing like
hell to think were skinnin by by all
holy hed swear that gale was downright
scared to tangle with him hed say it
deliberately curved away  shake out
them reefs mister an get the topsls to
her    poor ol typhoon sammy

thats how it was poor typhoon
sammy you heard about him every-
where it seems he came to the eastern
seas in a fine smart sailing-ship called
nirobe when he was young and full
of sap and all the world was just an oys-
ter easy enough for any bright lad to

crack he tangled with a typhoon in
the middle china sea and he came off
second best well good enough who
wouldnt  weve all of us had that acrid
bitter-tasting lump of gall that is naked
fear fouling our throats when that hur-
ricane batters us down you just swallow
as soon as you can and try to forget it
hoping for better luck next time but
not sammy yardabout that wasnt
good enough for him

so he quithis chief mates berth in the
nirobe to go back and hunt his ty-
phoon out and give it battle once again
he hunted everywhere he went from one
focstle to another picking only ships
in the typhoon trades and nothing hap-
pened the ship he was in skinned
through a voyage after hed quit that
ship would catch it or maybe the voy-
age after shed come limping in with a
battered hull a splintered superstructure
and some of her men with broken bones
it seems fantastic and it got to be legend-
ary if sammy yardabout was in the
focstle of your ship you were safe
enough from the weather it might pipe
a little or scurry about but the big wind
howled in some other latitude perhaps
just over the homon edge he usecjto
shake his fist sometimes when he thought
no one would see hurling silent challenge
across an empty ocean space it did no
good but he kept on hunting for his
enemy and he never meant to quit

  you saw him everywhere along those
coasts sooner or later some one was
bound to point him out    there goes
sammy yardabout says hes looking
for a hurricane and he means to beat it
down and sit for master after if he does
thats a laugh he must be daft look-
ing for a typhoon imagine that balmy
quite balmy thats what i always say
   and so he got to be a joke be-
cause sammy believed in things and
thats always funny to men who would
like to but cant

  so he batted about the east for the
lord knows how many years with his
luck as he put it against him from
the sunda strait through the natuna
channels along the sulu archipelago and
up as far as the yangtze kiang-till he
joined a ship that was my first command
the old pandora if you remember her
i do and thats how i got to be ship-
mates with a legend and a myth he
was in the third mates watch and i
heard them having good sport of him
down in the forward well just before true


darkness came after we cleared the hors-
burgh light out of singapore strait
bound for the port of hongkong by way
of manila bay   

  that sea can be like deep blue glass
at evening when the monsoon sleeps at
such a time you can imagine a world at
peace its men serene and all things in it
beautiful it seems impossible to con-
sider there is evil anywhere there is
such a quiet hush upon the ocean and
the scent of the land is sweet pursuing
the ship like a memory there is just
the murmur of the sea drowsily disturbed
by the bow wave and there is the gen-
tle throbbing of your engines underfoot

	the slow easy roll of the bridge was
a pleasant thing and the voices of the
men below drifted upward gently like the
murmur of the wise holding counsel at
dusk or the voices of the brave recalling
heroic deeds

  why sammy  one of the ranging
shadows on the forehatch said in a jocu-
lar tone you still down here with us
poor blokes  aint you the lads got a
ship of your own in his fist whenever
youve a mind 

  i can sit for master any time i want
if thats what you mean in sail any-
how

  it was a deep low voice said that it
came from the man with a pipe in his
mouth a deepwater felt hat on his big
head and a blue denim jacket cut like a
reefer coat over the white of his singlet
he seemed very large in the half light
and what he said he said th conviction

  someone laughed he means hes just
down here for his health and the fancy
grub who aint aint we all of us
skippers in the bud

  thats not true said samuel yard-
about his voice grave with dignity

  aint it the bosun stood up he
was an old man the bosun and to him
the joke had lost its savor sammy
he said stop kidding yourself some
men are born for the quarterdeck and
others are born to live under the bows
i know what im talking about i seen
it all my life well live in the focstle
till we die so will you well dream a
little about sittin for mate or master
but thats as far as ever it goes we got
the time who says we aim got the sense 
well why dont we you tell me that
why dont we somethin always gets
the payday an well do it the voyage after
that sure like hell wi will its no
good sammy better give up youre
down here with us an thats where youll

  stay-till the last eight bells calls the
  end of your watch an we send you down
  below through a well deck freeing-port
  with a grate bar at your feet for com-
  pany thats for me an i know it
  its for you too only you dont know
  it

    the bosuns voice sounded prophetic
  the way a clear voice will toward the end
  of day when the weather is fine and the
  sea is smooth but typhoon sammy
  didnt believe in any prophecy but his
  own so he looked up taking his pipe
  between his forefinger and his thumb
  thats not true he said again

  alow ripple of laughter arose sam-
  mys still lookin for the big wind
  thats gonna blow him clear

    the ripple gathered its weight at that
  till someone broke it into a great guffaw
  because they knew all about this thing
  thats right by jingo  that fellow said
  sammy was chief mate of a big flash
  sailin-ship in the early days out here
  till a typhoon hit him square between
  the eyes an scared him witless so hes
  a focstle boomer now but only for a
  little while sharp sarcasm came into
  that voice remembering past days of its
  own sure thing only for a little
  while only till-

    no  sammy yardabout came quick-
ly to his feet looking at them somberly

no he said that aint it you fel-
lows dont understand this is a differ-
ent thing it took me by surprise it
wasnt fair it never gave me warning
that wind came when i was just a kid
it battered my senses down and it tore
the breath from out my throat till it laid
me naked inside and shivering but only
before my own eyes dont you see
nobody knew  i had this bad leg by a
forebrace block that cracked my thigh
when we sent that small boat across to
that foundering schooner i couldnt have
gone if i wanted the second mate took
her who knew what i thought he
looked about him with insistent appeal
no one but me its myself alone
no one else

  then you shouldve kept your damn
trap shut the bosun judged with final-
ity who the hell aint scared when that
big slut begins to howl what you see
in mens eyes at a time like that sam-
my you better not talk about afterward
no no he cried again thats
just it i asked those fellows i came
right out and asked them and they
looked at me funny and walked away
thats when it dawned on me they were
just as frightened as me maybe even



more but thats not good i was chief
mate i was ready to sit for master i
could have had a ship and gone the rest
of my days with maybe never facing it
again lots of men have but i couldnt
dont you see i couldnt because i
tell you thats not good how can a
man be master with a thing like that at
the back of his head it just wont do
a mans got to be sure of hirtiself inside
deep inside a sailor officers skill and
knowledge ought to be clean clean as
his ticket clean as a hounds back
tooth

  he stopped talking for an instant he
stared out across the twilight sea where
all the gold was draining from the oceans
face leaving delicate half lights and pur-
ple shadows flicking along the easy swell
somehow you knew there
jrould be conquest in his eyes
until the end

ill hunt it out his voice fell still and
quiet wandering out into empty solitude
ill hunt that typhoon out one day or
another its got to meet me its got to 
because ill hunt it till it does an hon-
est shipmaster has got to face that thing

hes got to breathe when others cant
hes got to keep his head and all his skill
when others wont i can i know i
can and when i meet it ill show it
who is master because it can blow till
the hinges of its hell come loose ill
light my pipe if i can and ill stare it
straight in the eye and be damned to it
because if a man can smoke his pipe he
can think with clarity and thats what
a fellow has got to do at a time like that
you wait  he cried aloft to a place where
the gods of all the gales sit moodily
you wait and see when im fit to
walk a quarterdeck i will and if i aint
i wont

  thats what he told them not heeding
a bosuns wisdom who counseled patient
silence for all things as dark as that
but how could a man like sammy yard-
about hold his peace  he was too lone-
ly so he had to speak he had to
the blue book magazine

speak to the sea to the sky he had again
to hurl his gauntlet at an invisible hurri-
cane and he had to speak to his fel-
lows before he turned on his heel and
started aft for the ladder that went aloft

  there was a moment of taut silence
down there till someone grinned and
another smiled and then the laughter of
self-defense exploded after him pursuing
him he heard it but he didnt stop
he just kept walking away from them
tall and heavy-set limping a little be-
cause of that block that had smashed
him on the thigh so long ago when he was
mate in the ship that was called nirobe
he relieved the wheel promptly when
eight bells went and i thought if i looked
at him in the binnacle light his face would
be very old almost as old as the sea it
wasnt i couldnt tell you what age he
had his face was square and solid his
eyes deep set and wide apart under crags
of brows were amazingly clear and
bright like the eyes of the young in
heart and he was an expert helmsman
he steered with care   

  so we made manila bay by way of the
palawan passage and we sailed from
there for the port of hongkong in the
middle of the month of september with
typhoon sammy still in the third mates
watch he was like an excited hound-
dog on a baffling scent in the middle of
the night youd see him peering to wind-
ward sniffing the weather and muttering
to himself its around here some-
where the mate heard him growl one
time i wonder how he knew  because
as we worked up toward the pratas reef
the barometer began to dance in tune to
the wireless yarns about the life cycle of
a typhoon whelped somewhere around the
northern tip of luzon

on the chart we watched its plot it
had started northwestward then it
dipped a little as if it meant to hurry
south but not for long it must have
known where sammy was we maneu-
vered to be clear of it but it didnt act
the way it should and we had no luck
that trip that was our idea it wasnt
what sammy yardabout thought be-
cause when the cirrus was thick over-
head when twilight came in the middle
of the day with the sticky oppression up-
on the restlessly swollen ocean he stood
at the rail motionless and very straight
he was peering off across an ominously
heaving sea to where the black shadow
of typhoon began its dark climb to the
zenith and in that unnatural stillness

you can never forget once youve known
it i heard him say with clarity like a
voice giving solemn utterance in a hol-
low deserted place this is it   
he was right it was

  it came with a great clap of thunder
and a livid flame of lightning that tongued
clear across the ertire sky typhoon
sammy lifted his face to welcome it
why wouldnt he hadnt he waited
long enough  i remember that face it
was quiet with patience and with long-
gathered strength he kept it raised
aloft so that his enemy could plainly see
it and see that in it there was no despair
and the torrential rain fell down upon
that face till the water streamed from it
and behind that rain there was wind

we took it on the starboard quarter
holding that course while it started
shrieking destruction at us there is no
other gale on earth has the sound of true
typhoon its wildness is persistent and
intolerable there is no crevice or fault
in a mans spiritual armor it cannot find
and penetrate typhoon sammy would
know that he had heard it once before
and had time enough to prepare before
it came again and you could plainly see
what great good luck he thought he had
when the mate sighted that dismasted
sailing-ship wallowing in a black trough
forked lightning cruelly revealing her

  she was caught in a mesh between an-
gry sky and raging sea there was no
space between at alii it was difficult to
tell whether those rockets spinning up
with bubbles of light exploded in the
ocean or in the typhoon rack but there
she was shed been through her hell a
little sooner than we and there wasnt
much left of her st umps of masts stick-
ing up from a waterlogged hull awash
in a clutter of her own wreckage the
seas that swept her were shining and
black till they broke clear across her
in seething white to show the moving
arm of one of her men on the poopr or
the dark shape of another everyone for-
got about sammy vho thinks of legends
at a time like that we were wondering
what the devil we could do could we
get a boat across in that sea-and
before the full trial of typhoon came
for this we knew was no more than
the advance guard of hurricane the
whole fury of it wasnt far behind well
could we the mate didnt know it
was typhoon sammy who told us he
was sure he came bursting in where
he had no right to be blazing


the iron whirlwind

  it can he cried beside himself i
know it sir this is the place this is
where it happened before i should
have smashed him down at once send-
ing him out to the lookouts place where
he belonged of course telling me
stuff like that but i couldnt not the
way it poured out of him not the way
his eyes burned he wasnt insolent at
all though it might sound that way he
wasnt insubordinate he couldnt be
not sammy he vas just pleading for
his right he thought that gale was his
own opponent personal and shrewd it
had put this thing in his way with crafty
deliberation hoping to confound him in
the same latitude where it happened be-
fore he had to show it he didnt care

  youd be surprised sir he told me
youd be surprised what men can do
he was taut as he fo lowed me into the
dark and pitching wheelhouse he was
tense and the wind was yammering at
the ship when the chief mate said by
god we got to try while theres still a
chance im for it

  better start the oil-bags then run
up a signal burst and see if those fellows
over there can do the same it would
help pick your own men mister for
theboat

  i will pull the stroke said samuel
yardabout just as if that matter had long
ago been settled and lie was stating no
more than a fact

so he pulled the stroke the way he
said he would and when i could i
watched how the battle went though the
most of that was done by him in solitude
which was proper and eminently just
he said id be surprised what men could
do when they must i was with our
funnel smoke beating out stiff and flat-
on the sea we got the  ship around to
windward floating our oil-slick down
and in what we were pleased to call a
lull our best boat took the water and
started across

  how they managed it no one will ever
know not even the men who did the job
the mate who had the steering-sweep in
his fists told me later it had a lot to do
with the way sammys eyes were on him
there was something in them he said
something hard and tough as steel each
time that fellow lay back with his weight
upon the stroke it could give an officer
strength and sustenance i dont won-
der i saw it myself from my place in
the open wing maneuvering the small-
boat went scending dizzily aloft with the

  rearing flank of an oil-filmed sea and the
  next instant was out of sight in the mons-
  trous cavern beyond but when she came
  into view again struggling there he was
  there he was with his shining face aloft
  there was just enough of sick gray light
  to see it spattered with brine something
  between a smile and a challenge very
  clearly in his stare his lips were a little
  parted maybe he was crying all heaven
  and earth to bear him witness in this
  trial it had on it the look of ecstatic
  joy it had about it the appearance and
  the quality of majesty it wasnt easy
  to forget

  that way a tossing little cockleshell
  closed with a foundering wreck while
  we gave what lee we could it wasnt
  much not down where they were
  hemmed in by the hurrying ocean walls
  with the mad skirl of the wind in their
  ears and the blinding sea in their eyes
  and the storm rack racing headlong over-
  head just the bare difference between
  survival and destruction not more than
  that and barely that we could see the
  line snake out when they tried to float
  it down we could see dark shapes in
  the sinking hulk with her bulwarks
  awash struggling to retrieve it once-
  and again no good there was too
  much wreckage in between broken
  masts splintered spars a rubble of
  thrashing cordage and canvas from which
  the sea kept spouting heavenward then
  with startling suddenness a man went
  overside from our boat he went abrupt-
  ly with a bowline about him and that
  man was sammy yardabout

    the sea swallowed him at once it
  rose up and engulfed him carelessly and
  then went hurrying away with its upper
  lip curling in the clouds but when the
  trough flattened out he was there be-
  cause there was tension on the line to
  let them know they had better slack off
  and be quick and there was a battered
  deepwater hat floating alongside where
  he was he let the ocean carry him by
  god it had carried him before but he
  guided himself this time until the stern
  of that hulk hid him and he disappeared
  from sight not for long though there
  was a clear space there sammy must
  have seen it under the transom by the
  rudder chains thats how he got aboard
  thats how he hauled himself on to a
  vessels poop again by the strength of
  his own two fists he came over a bro-
  ken taffrail up out of stormy seas bring-
  ing a lifeline with him while the signs of
  
full typhoon grew blacker and more dead-
ly in the sky and thats how the rescue
was made

  he sent them over the stern one by
one to be hauled through the water to
where a small boat plunged and reared to
a small sea anchor not very far away
we were watching we knew what was
going on in the narrow howling wilder-
ness separating the tramp pandora from
sammy yardabout who was such a joke
along the china coasts because he wanted
to find a typhoon and single-handed do
it battle well he did do you think
a man like that could ever be cheated of
his just deserts he sent them over one
by one with his big back bent while he
heaved the line but in between standing
solid and erect and do you suppose a
man like that would listen to a ship-
master telling him he ought to be the last
to go not much sammy sent that last
man over too and now he was all alone
i dont think it bothered him at all you
could tell that by the way he looked
around him he seemed so still in the
midst of fury he seemed so serene with
confusion all around

  a monstrous roller came lifting out of
darkness roaring toward him dwarfing
him the mate in the small boat waved
wildly no doubt he was screaming
warning so unconsciously were we
as if the feeble sound of a human voice
could be heard maybe sammy saw
what was advancing on him maybe he
didnt he was reaching slowly for the
line his hand was about to grasp it
when that ninth sea toppled over it
swamped him when it cleared he was
down a tumble of wreckage pinning him

he struggled-but not for long soon
he stopped his eyes went to wind-
ward to that place where his enemy was
the wind was higher now lifting its
voice the seas beyond the dissipating
oil-slick came leaping weirdly into vision
tall and confused and piling higher with
the making gale the thunderheads were
rolling toward us livid lightning flaming
along the craggy clouds of storm he
knew what it meant that shrill scream
was crescendoing there wasnt much
time left to maneuver to reclaim a boat
to put a ship in the wind and prepare for
what the banshees really had in store

  so sammy yardabout reached for his
sheath-knife its blade glinted for an
instant catching all the light there was
from where he lay he could just reach
the taffrail where the lifeline was made

fast without hesitation he cut it and
then-deliberately-he made a waving
gesture with his upflung arm to tell the
mate to be on his way typhoon sammy
yardabout could face what was left
alone he needed no help for that from
any man that was the way it had to be

so our boat came home without him
what else could the chief mate do
somehow or another we hooked it on and
lifted it aboard then we looked back
when there was time all of us to
where he was there was that compul-
sion on us salute on the face of every si-
lent man why not  i know to my eyes
he was very plain-like a sight of some-
thing good seen for an instant in a blind-
ing light before utter darkness comes
and therefore forever after remembered
just before the great squall struck we
saw him with that clarity a figure half
prone on the deck of a sinking hulk with
the seas leaping up all around and the
heavens black and angry overhead

  he must have heard the first high
whistling squeal of hurricane because he
turned his head as if to listen or maybe
just to smile at it with slow serenity he
meant to tell it lie was ready he had
waited long enough just then that ship
took a monstrous lurch suddenly she
flung her counter free of foam her
name leaped up it leaped up into mo-
mentary vision like a living thing want-
ing to make itself known before oblivion
came nirobe no wonder typhoon
sammy stayed he was the same man
it was the same ship perhaps it was the
selfsame gale answering sammys in-
solent challenge on its own shrewd terms
in its own good time do you suppose
he cared  not sammy yardabout he
probably blessed great good fortune such
as that because i tell you he had his
pipe in his mouth somehow or another
he had got it lit and he meant to sit
there till the hinges of the typhoons hell
blew loose-while he stared it straight
in the eye with a clear brain and an un-
afraid heart because that as he said
himself is what a fellow has got to do
if his knowledge of himself is to be as
clean as his ticket is clean as a hounds
back tooth

  thats the way we saw him that time
sammy yardabout reached the end of
his questing and found his hurricane at
last we saw him sitting calmly and
with dignity pinned down by wreckage
he made no attempt to lift quietly smok-
ing his pipe while black typhoon spun


quong pb ja and his foster-daug-hter found a man all alone and half dead

down to destroy him while the rain came
slashing down upon his uplifted face i
remember i reached for the whistle-rope
and i pulled it down three times we
barely heard that seamans gesture of sa-
lute and farewell for the roar of the sea
the booming of the gale and when i
looked again the blackness was intense
there was a solid wall of water to hide
his solitary contention from the eyes of
his fellowman he had disappeared com-
pletely but somehow you knew there
would be a smile of conquest in his eyes
and a look of great glory on his face un-

til the very end what more could sam-
my ask blotted from sight he was
alone with his own typhoon   

  it is old quong pu li the whampoa
merchant prince who ought to tell what
is left to tell but quong doesnt talk
very much he only smiles blandly in
a mysteriously oriental way maybe
thats to hide what deep joy he feels
when you speak of men and things he
greatly admires when quong was mid-
dle-aged long before demolition bombs
were perfectly understood he was the sur-
vivor of a bias bay pirate raid on a junk
the blue book magazine

he owned together with a starry-eyed
child whose white parents all her kin on
earth were murdered before her eyes on
a bloody deck quong adopted helen
blaine because he is that kind of man
he called her precious treasure and
she moved in his household afterward
slim with grace and beauty and sadness

  it was the palatial pleasure-junk of
quong pu li and his foster-daughter
that picked up the broken battered hulk
of a dismasted sailing-ship near tailong
head after the typhoon passed and still-
ness returned to the sea

   it was the ntrobe she had rice in her
cargo holds it swelled enormously plug-
ging her leaking seams tjll the ocean
scornfully tossed her up against the land
they found a man who had lashed him-
self on her poop he was all alone and
half dead but he had a pipe clutched
fast in his fist and a strange still smile
on his senseless face as if he had lately
looked quite calmly on the face of every
evil thing and had found he was un-
afraid and could easily stare it down
helen blaine nursed him back to health
through fever and delirium he raved
quite often in the still dark nights not
knowing where he was he raved about
typhoons mostly about loneliness about
terror conquered and about a high wind
that is senseless and knows neither ruth
nor mercy and can find out every human
fault if a man isnt careful and fore-
warned she stroked his forehead and
she calmed him giving him comfort and
renewed strength and once when the
moon was full its light shining on the
polished lacquer panels of the exotic
room she told him quietly i too have
been through hurricane

  he looked deeply into her eyes and
must have seen what he wanted there
he saw she wasnt laughing he saw she
understood because after that he was
whole again and he told quong pu li
he was fit to be the master of a ship
quong merely nodded being chinese
he believed in tradition too so he spent
a fortune refitting the nirobe while he
waited till sammy yardabout went away
and came back with a masters ticket in
his fist what questions could a board
of examiners ask sammy he wouldnt
know about helen waited too

that barque was a lovely sight-in
tow for the lye mun pass out of the
harbor of hongkong with the dread sig-
nal aloft on blackhead hill she was
standing straight for the massing cloud-

banks sunset touching her spars where
the men aloft were shaking loose the up-
per sails but she was growing smaller
making steadily for the sea i put my
glasses on her wishing to see her name
again nirobe i saw him too with clar-
ity under the bright cloud of his own pe-
culiar greatness peering steadfastly into
the eye of the wind that man on the
poop was captain samuel yardabout

at his side there was a woman she
i too could look with confidence to
that place where the great gales brew

  there are men cn the china coast who
will leer about helen yardabout they
will wink slyly when they tell you how
quong is a wise cld bird with that tale
about piracy ho like moses in the
bulrushes what a likely yarn they
mean to imply she had chinese blood
well i know it isnt true but i know if
she had it would do her little harm and
then as i looked those two figures
merged into one the barque nirobe was
just a pale fine shadow a thing of deli-
cate beauty from the past moving with
confident functional grace into a cloudy
and unknown future

  i heard a junior third mate growling
his complaint again	

  is that fellow mad he wanted to
know once more cant he read a signal-
flag at all 

  oh yes captain yardabout could read
the signs all right he knew all about
typhoons and he judged what its track
would be he knew this one wasnt for
him he knew it with certainty he was
qualified and sure enough some hours
later the black across came down and a
red cone went aloft instead maybe that
thing knew where sammy was and it
curved away to the north and west know-
ing who its master was   

  so whenever you see that fine tall ship
leaning along these ancient coasts with a
solid man on her quarterdeck pacing
erectly with just a little of limp you will
know who it is and you will know who
the woman is at his side thats typhoon
sammy yardabout an old china hand
who hunted a hurr icane and found it and
through the eye of it climbed back with-
out fear to the solitary place of command
he did it himself he did it alone be-
cause he believed iin things and to a man
like that nothing else will do he had to
be sure if youve had good fortune and
have seen what there is to see on his face
and on her face too yott will know ex-
actly what i mean

a james lee detective
story-

     by

hugh

wiley

illustrated by
hamilton greene

n sunday afternoon in his of-
fice in san francisco james
lee of the narcotic bureau
turned away from a sheet of
memoranda that lay on his desk he
summoned his secretary a trace of im-
patience was in his voice call los an-
geles and reno and ask mr morgan and
mr blair to come in here at once he
directed tell them to catch the first
available planes

  when the secretary had gone he left
his office and headed for chinatown he
walked along grant avenue jmtil he
ame to the double blessing bazaar he
entered this pungent emporium and
smiled pleasantly at three somnolent
lerks and at the proprietor old hing
vioy out of respect for the elder china-
nan mr lee filled a moment with the
ippropriate phrases of formal salutation
ind then i desire to speak with you in
irivate he said

  old hing moy led the way to his low-
eilinged office under the balcony rang-
ng across the rear of the store when
lee was seated hing moy asked 

  the subject of our conference
abandoning all superfluous ceremony
why have you summoned the killers
lee asked with a directness that made
old hing moy blink his eyes can it be
that my ears are liars  six men notori-
ously the messengers of death who serve
you and the various other elders of your
league-summoned from new york and
chicago and seattle shall i name
them 

  old hing moy smiled it is unnec-
essary he said you are of clear per-
ception

  i have one thousand eyes james
lee admitted blandly have these kill-
ers been summoned to avenge sin yuts
theft of autumn lotus

  hing moy nodded yes the man-
tle of deception cannot hide the truth
from you

  you know that sin yut has married
her-that she is his number one wife
  a matter of small moment whether
she is his wife or one of his slaves the
theft of autumn lotus must be paid for
in blood

  james lee reached for his check-book
and wrote a check payable to hing moy
here are six thousand slices of sin
yuts flesh he said six thousand dol-
lars it is a generous price for the au-
tumn lotus sin yut has married her

  and he will be a gentle master give me
  your word that you will call off the kill-
  ers and this treasure is yours

  hing moy devoted a brief three sec-
  onds to contemplation of the possi-
  bility of driving a better bargain then
  knowing lees methods he said you
  may tell sin yut to enjoy tranquil sleep
  the boo how dcy will not molest him a
  
movo nliintl mr	tlm tnt

man said come aboard i dc-
fcire to set joii pin inly-tvliilo
jon diet

cup of wine now to celebrate this auspi-
cious occasion-arid to seal our lips
james lee lifted his eyebrows quick
to observe this hing moy said i beg
your pardon

  thank you the shadow will serve
for the substance lee made a gesture
toward hing moy your health long
life ten thousand blessings and seven
sons to mourn at your jrave 

  hing moy removed his spectacles as a
token of respect to a superior stood up
bowed thrice to lee and shook hands
with himself may the waters of life
be cool in thy throat the fruits of heaven
sweet upon thy tongue pointing up
and down then to lee and to himself
between heaven and earth only you
and i share the knowledge of this mo-
ment
  lee smiled at the absurdity of trying
to keep a secret that would be known
to chinatown in the next hour good-
by he said good luck 

  at the door of the double blessing
bazaar lee turned left on grant avenue
and walked to his office to his secre-
tary ill be out for the rest of the day
he said ill probably be back in the
morning did you reach mr morgan
and air blair

  both of them the man informed
him mr morgan should be at the
union air terminal right now

  call the airport id like to speak
with him

the call went through in three min-
utes when edgar morgan came on
the line you have ten minutes havent

  fifteen edgar morgan said we
will be five minutes late taking off
whats up

lee directed ive called blair in from
reno his district is loaded with opium

swered worse than it has been in the
last five years

cago was clear of it wednesday-a thou-
sand pipes were smoking last night it

source

james lee answered im calling on
sin yut

  shaken out of the calm that had char-
acterized his conversation holy did
double-quick murder morgan protest-
ed listen are you crazy 

  steady down think fast sin yut
is vulnerable

 you mean that dame autumn lo-
tus  morgan asked

  exactly sin yut was safe as a
church except for that mistake old
hing moy flashed a call for the killers
on monday an hour ago sin yuts life
was worth less than thirty cents

  so what

  i bought it for six thousand dollars
  who from 

  old hing moy himself

  i get you morgan said its good
work-if it works listen let me make
the play to sin ytt youll be blasted
into hamburger before you get a chance
to start your first move

  thank you james lee said ill
take care of that if my foot slips you
might-you might present him with a
bill for the funeral expenses theres
not much risk

  risk i still sey youre crazy ed-
gar morgan began to talk fast what
about your trouble with him last year
what about his greek dope-runners that
had you fouled in october  what about
that mess of chinamen you stopped at
the border three months ago hes lost
half a million bucks on you in the last
two years go ahead with this program
and youll be dead by morning wait
until i get there let me take the rap
little autumn lotus is worth more
to him than i have cost him james
lee said ill play this hand myself
dont rock the boat

  if anything happens to you tonight
edgar morgan declared sin yuts next
birthday will stay away from now on
thanks lee said good-by he
hung up the telephone and turned to his
secretary you heard me

  the secretary his eyes wide with fear
nodded in silence then listen mr
lee why not wait arid let mr morgan
or mr blair go up there

  lee smiled because neither of them
happens to know sin yut as i do he
answered he rose ill see you tomor-
row morning he said to his secretary

  he left the office on the street fifty
feet from the entrance of the building
he found his car you may have the
evening off he said to his driver re-
port tomorrow morning at nine oclock
he got into his car and swung into the
traffic stream that flowed toward the ap-
proach to the bay b ridge

by the time he reached the secondary
highway paralleling the channels of
the delta night had fallen fifteen miles
to the north he swung into the narrow
road along the south shore of elbow is-
land he slowed the car to twenty miles
the thin light of a fading moon silvered
the willows that fringed the shoreline
the road rutted and broken with the
harvest traffic demanded careful driv-
ing he looked at the clock on the in-
strument panel of the car

  seven-forty he mused another
mile-and then the game begins

  another mile along the way where the
road dived into the ghostly shade of a
clump of sycamores he parked the car
at the brink of the leveenear the wa-
ters edge a spot of fi re glowed red in the
moonlight

  what do you want a voice asked
can you row me down to sin yuts
boat 

  thats my job the voice answered
are you a chink 

  james lee blinked at the red glow of
the boatmans fire no he said he
got into the boat

  the boatman began rowing westward
with the slow tidal current

  has sin yut shifted the pavilion of
delight  lee asked

  sure things got too hot over near
dog town too many white girls come
aboard how long since you been here
last

  six months lee said

  i see  it aint far now shes lay-
ing against the far bank right around the
next bend

a hundred yards from the pavil-
ion of delight a peremptory chal-
lenge rang across the shadowed water
the lookouts voice lifted loud above the
medley of muffled music and the human
voices in the cabins of the hulking craft
ill answer him lee said he called
to the vigilant lookout tell your mas-
ter sin yut that james lee wants to
see him

  at this as if the mob on board the pa-
vilion of delight had been engulfed by
the moving waters of a tidal wave the
tumult of voices diminished to silence
there followed a sharp staccato dialogue
in cantonese from the upper deck of
the pavilion of delight a shaft of light
launched downward through the dark-
ness searching the surface of the rippled
water a door of a cabin on the upper
deck opened and from the lighted rec-
tangle of the doorway a fat man robed
in flowing silk addressed lee

  move ahead mr lee the fat man
said come aboard i desire to see you
plainly-while you die 

  i too have words to speak regarding
death james lee replied your death
not mine

  you have put your head into the ti-
gers mouth come aboard before my
guards rip you to pieces with their guns
get alongside lee said to his boat-
man to the fat sin yut a wise man
understands a nod  i come without
weapons claiming a guests immunity
dead silence for a moment and then
to his chinese killers on the lower deck
of the pavilion of delight hold your
fire sin yut commanded more loud-
ly come aboard thou pilgrim of the
night for the moment have no fear
then tempering his formal courtesy with
a characteristic cruelty you may dis-
miss your boatman he added your
craft on the return journey will be a
funeral barge

  landing beside the pavilion of de-
light two chinese men suddenly moved
out of the darkness to stand beside
james lee the door-up front the
the fat sin yut a sardonic smile up-
on his face bowed with some cere-
mony to lee please to enter my apart-
ments he said opening a wide door that
revealed a room whose luxurious furnish-
ings were strangely in contrast with the
shoddy scene below in the vernacular
of the street youre a wiseguy mr
lee but theres a lot you dont know
sin yut said sit down    you got
lots of life insurance

  plenty lee suggested enough to
carry me through tonight

  sin yut sat down at a teakwood table
from a shallow drawer to his right he
hauled out a blue  automatic may-
be this will make a lot of noise-but
what of it does your insurance policy
say anything in it about fish eating you 
i havent read it very carefully   
incidentally read these james lee
took three service telegrams from his
breast pocket and tossed them over to
sin yut the stolid master of the pa-
vilion of delight picked up the messages
they were from agents of the bureau in
seattle chicago and new york sin
yut glanced at the first one his eyes
widened in surprise and his florid fea-
tures turned gray with fear his trem-
bling hands made the reading of the third
telegram difficult he controlled him-
self with obvious effort and his face was
livid the boo how doythe killers
when will they be here

  the killers will not reach you lee
assured him for the moment you may
be at ease

  what do you mean asked sin yut
let us say that i have saved your
life

  saved my life sin yut repeated
at what price

  james lee leaned forward sin yut
you know that i have never lied to you
these men meant your death i bought
your life from hing moy

  i have been blind ask what you
will and it is yours

you are careless with your promises
i desire to know the source of the opium
that is spreading through the west
sin yut cringed i do not know
what is the source of your supply
who are the principals of the syndicate

door opened to reveal a colorful group
whose revelry had been halted by a sud-
den sense of impending tragedy two
long fan-tan tables flanked a central pas-
sageway that led aft the air was thick
with smoke under the vapors of stale
tobacco lay the heavy scent of opium
a dance-floor beyond the tables held an
assemblage of dancers that included a
dozen white girls through this mob
lee walked directly toward a stairway
that led upward to open balconies from
which visitors might observe the scene
below sin yut waited for him at the
head of the stairway bowing to the fat
proprietor of the pavilion of delight
plenteous years lee said seven dec-
ades of felicity

  chuh liao si ti sin yut growled
you have entered a place of death
enough of fighting james lee an-
swered where can we converse in
greater privacy

r
 will guide you he said you are rich
 in wisdom

   lee glanced at the rectangular tin con-
 tainer and slipped it into the right-hand
 pocket of his coat thank you he
 said to sin yut my compliments to
 the lady autumn lotus and now will
 you repay what i spent for your life and
 arrange to have me put ashore

   what did-my life cost you

   six thousand dollars

   to his unseen servant get me six
 thousand dollars sin yut directed

docs your insurance policy say
anything about fish eating you

where do i search where do i strike
this time to destroy this latest enter-
prise 

  sin yuts features went gray again
i do not know he repeated and then
if i should tell you i would be killed
within the week

  lee frowned your words are shad-
ows on the water 

  sin yut faltered i have no choice
i shall not force you to answer me
one thing i shall do or you sin
yut offered you are blessed with the
perception of ten thousand scholars
over his shoulder he called to an unseen
servant opium he said bring me
a tin-unopened

  a moment later the heavy curtains of
a doorway parted a chinese man came
in on a lacquered tray he carried a
rectangular tin lithographed in black
and yellow sin yut waved the servant
away he picked up the lithographed
tin and handed it to james lee this

  when the blood-money had been re-
turned to james lee the honored guest
is leaving sin yut said tears of re-
gret make this moment bitter

  the moment is sweetened with mem-
ories of pleasures enjoyed lee returned
may the middle pathway lead you to
happiness great wealth for you in the
favor of milo fo tranquillity in the
smile of kwan yin

sin yuts boatman set lee ashore
at midnight he was back in his apart-
ment in san francisco

  i am tired he said to his servant
a decanter of sherry-and that will be
all tonight

  when his servant had left him he
drank two glasses of the warming wine
thereafter for an hour he devoted him-
self to an intensive study of the rectan-
gular brightly lithographed tin of opium
that sin yut had given him the bot-
tom of the tin was bright metal the
for an hour lee devoted himself to an intensive study of tie tin of opium

top of the tin and its sides were covered
with inscriptions in four languages
portuguese skinless and boneless sar-
dines in pure olive oil he read net
contents seven ounces at half-past one
in the morning possessed of a dozen sig-
nificant facts concerning the opium and
its container he went to bed

at nine oclock monday in his office
 to blair and morgan i have a hot
hunch about that stuff lee said point-
ing to the tin of opium on his desk the
tin can is authentic enough the metal
is -gauge birmingham there is a
trace of wolframite present in the tin-
which probably means that the source
was cornwall the opium was undoubt-
edly refined in maqao and packed in
sardine-tins in portugal get some wires
out blair and check up on the imports

of portuguese sardines along the pacific
coast for the last thirty days he
turned to edgar morgan i want a list
of all the portuguese ships or ships un-
der portuguese charter that have come
through the canal to the pacific coast in
the last month

  at half-past ten we can discard all
ideas of chinese or japanese sources 
lee decided in the first place either
would have meant malay tin no wolf-
ramite in that stuff in the second place
the opium is in an authentic sardine-can
the inks and the design of the inscrip-
tion check exactly with the real thing
of the portuguese ships that you dug up
morgan i think that tramp tamega is
the hot spot she came up the pacific
coast ten days age it makes the tim-
ing perfect she probably landed her
cargo somewhere in monterey bay get
your hat blair were headed for mon-
terey he turned to edgar morgan
blair and i will have lunch at the del
monte hotel ill telephone you when
we get there

  over the telephone at one-forty-five
edgar morgan said to james lee go
up and look over the cafe capitan at
brocado it is a new night-spot with a
couple of hot numbers running it
motta barbossa is the boss another
bad actor by the name of jose cabral is
an undercover partner  thirty-five face
chopped up five feet eight-has a dope
record in havana and new york he
has no business dabbling around in a
penny-ante deal like the cafe capitan
good work lee complimented
keep at it ill call you later

  lee confided morgans information to
blair it sounds interesting blair
commented whats ihe play

  i want you to mix around the mon-
terey waterfront with the men of the
fishing-fleet im going to the cafe cap-
itan and have a quick look-see

the festivities in the cafe capitan
had ended at three oclock that morn-
ing lee found only a watchman on duty
he was a lanky texan fifty years old
andhe had been overseas in the war
monday is a holiday for the cooks and
waiters he explained all the dealers
and everybody

  do you open again tuesday

 the watchman nodded the chef
dutch miller and his helper get here
about one oclock tuesday afternoon
the waiters and bartenders blow in
about six

  how long has the place been run-
ning

  three months now    say boy
whats your name 

 my name is james lee do you
mind if i have a look around inside
you aint got no more chance to look
around inside than a snowflake in hell 
it became necessary for dee to intro-
duce himself when this had been ac-
complished the watchman held out his
hand

  pardner im sure proud to meet you
he said my name is sam webb i
heard about how you cleaned up that
frisco gang two years ago

  all right if i have a look around in-
side  lee repeated

  ill say so look your head off   
whats going on

  i dont know-yet

  webb opened a door to the kitchen of
the cafe capitan this room occupied
the southeast corner of the building in
the kitchen sam webb said the
dining-room is out there

  whats this door

  i dont pack a key to that door its
the pastry-room and the meat-refrigera-
tor i guess old mutt barbossa figures
ill kill myself eating cake out this way
to the dining-room

from the dining-room the watchman
led the way to the lobby of the club
thats the bar there the bosses office
is through that door there the book-
keepers joint is back of it

  james lee looked at the door in the
north wall of the lobby thats the
gambling-room i suppose

  thats it i got a key to that one if
you want to get in

  after while lee said have you a
key to the office

  sure  got to answer the phone when
it rings the bookkeepers room is right
next to it

  sam webb selected a key from a col-
lection of twenty he unlocked the door
of the office clicked on a light and stood
aside so that lee might enter step in-
side he said

  lee walked into the office over his
shoulder he asked

  webb how long since you have been
in here

  i aint been in there since i come on
duty i got to vacuum the dining-room
always and the bar and the casino and
everything before i do much loafing
have a look here lee directed he
pointed to the figure of a little old bearded
man slouched across the office desk

  holy gee its old muttl i didnt
know he was in here i thought he left
in cabrals car

  motta barbossa the proprietor
lee asked

  sure listen mr lee he looks sick
to me

  james lee unbuttoned barbossas coat
and vest and listened in vain for his
heart-beats he is dead he announced
conscious of a quick annoyance at this
added complication of his problem he
turned to sam webb i wish you would
get your car and drive down to the mon-
terey waterfront double quick he said
my associate joe blair is probably
mixing around with the men of the fish-
ing-fleet find him quick and bring him
back with you-and dont spill this to


the police ill call them presently but
right now i need some time to work on
this job alone leave your keys with
me

 when webb had gone lee began a
close inspection of the setting and of the
dead man a fresh stain of green ink on
the lining of barbossas vest the peculiar
pallor of the mans skin and the unusual
temperature of his body excited a quick
suspicion that death had not been from
natural causes after ten minutes con-
fused by a jumble of new factors that
had appeared in his complex problem
he said to himself damn it heres an-
other jungle that ive got to explore

he searched the dead mans pockets
finding a check-book a fountain
pen a wallet that held a miscellany of pa-
pers and some currency a bunch of keys
a pocket comb two handkerchiefs and a
dollar watch he laid these on the desk
in front of barbossa he picked up the
fountain pen from which the ink had
leaked out to stain the lining of bar-
bossas vest he examined this pen un-
der a ten-power lens he picked up the
keys and looked at the door of the book-
keepers room of the seven keys that
barbossa carried the fourth fitted the
lock of this door at the far end of the
bookkeepers room under an iron-barred
window there was a couch a high desk
stood against the east wall

  the steel door of a fireproof vault
framed into the west wall of the room
claimed his attention the lock on the
vault was fitted for a key and the ap-
propriate key was included on barbossas
key-ring james lee clicked the lock and
swung down on the short lever that op-
erated the bolts he opened the door
of the vault stacked boxes filled it from
the floor to the nine-foot ceiling he
stepped back and reached for an electric-
light switch on the wall near the door
he flashed on this light and turned for
a second look at the vaults contents on
each box was a larger legend similar to
the colorful inscriptions on the sardine-
tin that sin yut had given him portu-
gese sardines he read packed in pure
olive oil he made a quick estimate of
his find too much fish six by eight
by twenty-nearly a thousand cubic feet
opium    a thousand cubic feet   
twenty-five tons

  the crash of a pistol-shot interrupted
his arithmetic he felt the searing pain
of a hot bullet burning through the mus-
cles of his right shoulder on the in-

stant seeking the protection of the steel
door he swung behind it he reached for
a blue-barreled  in his right hip pocket
and fired twice at the figure of a man
framed in the lighted doorway of bar-
bossas office the first shot missed its
mark but at the second a yelp of pain
came as a tribute to his aim he saw a
pistol drop from the mans hand he
stepped from behind the steel door of the
vault and swung his  up to the mans
heart

  steady or ill kill you he threatened
come in here

  the man obeyed

 who are you lee demanded

   give a guess you damn burglar who
are you

  with his left hand lee reached for the
thin steel handcuffs that he carried he
tossed them to his captive theyre
open he said link your right wrist
and get over to that window come
along snap that other cuff around one
of those iron bars across the window
quick

  obeying since failure to obey obvious-
ly meant death the prisoner turned from
the window snarling his rage at james
l

  ill kill you mighty quick he aid
ill kill you like a rat when i get loose
you wont get loose-for a while
who are you dont answer youre
jose cabral remembering edgar mor- 
gans description of the man-thirty-five
years old five-feet-eight face chopped
up and with a dope record in havana
and new york he said listen cabral
why did you kill barbossa

  the man cringed dont say that i
didnt kill him then give me a
towel or something will you  you want
me to bleed to death 

lee felt his own blood wet and warm
j against his right shoulder youll
live through it he predicted grimly
live through it-to be hanged  he
walked into the office and picked up the
telephone from the desk in front of the
dead man get me the chief of police
of brocado he said to the operator to
the chief this is james lee speaking-
narcotic bureau ive got two men for
you one dead and one alive come out to
the cafe capitan as quickly as you can
bring your coroner with you ask him
to bring a surgical kit two of us need
some first aid

 he hung up the telephone and gave
a bit of advice to jose cabral
  take it easy he suggested dont
bruise my handcuffs	- -

  he locked the door on cabral and de-
voted the next five minutes to an ex-
amination of the kitchen the pastry-
room and the refrigerator he opened
the door of the pantry with a key he
found in barbossas collection he re-
turned to barbossas office he opened
the door of the bookkeepers room and
again for ten minutes he engaged him-
self with a further investigation of bar-
bossas corpse

  presently addressing cabral why
did you kill barbossa he repeated

holy gee its old mutt

i didnt know lie was in
here listen mr lee lie
looks sick to me

  cabral his face gray with pain scowled
at lee get me a drink of water will
you listen wise guy you aint got me
for murder yet-and the chances are ill
beat your hop rap before im through
who killed barbossa james lee
persisted

  youre a hop dick aint you youre
supposed to know everything you dont
know nothing wise guy youre licked 
lee was silent for a moment and then
reviewing a dozen bits of contradictory
evidence that he had discovered in his
latest search maybe youre right he
admitted again he asked who killed
barbossa
ijlsten wise guy you aint got me for
murder yet

 i should have killed him the
damned low-life cabral raged that
hop would have been spread out long be-
fore this if he hadnt spent all his time
playing around with dames

  the sound of men tramping through
the kitchen interrupted cabrals state-
ment lee turned to see blair coming
through the doorway of the office
what you got  blair asked

  two men-and twenty-five tons of
opium james lee answered that
dead man at the desk is barbossa thats
cabral over there-linked to the win-
dow

  your friend sam webb is here with
the brocado police outfit blair said
chief of police joe mason-and the
coroner did you call them

 yes we need them

  here they are

joe mason dr gale and three of ma-
sons men came into the narrow room
this is james lee-my boss blair
said to joe mason then to lee what
the hell is the matter with your shoul-
der

  answering blairs question with a state-
ment to the police chief this shoulder
-and cabrals hand-thats why i asked

you to have your coroner bring his tools
with him cabral shot me before i
winged him

  meet dr gale the chief said

  lee shook hands with the coroner if
you will stop a little blood for me i will
be grateful

yhats been going on the chief
  w asked

  gabral and barbossa are back of the
biggest opiym job that has been put over
in the last ten years lee said i can
take care of cabral but theres an angle
to old barbossas death thatll interest
you

  meaning what chief mason asked
wait until dr gale has a look at bar-
bossa

  when he had bandaged cabrals hand
and after he had dressed the wound in
lees shoulder dr gale fumbled around
the dead barbossa for five minutes and
then brightly to chief mason and the
assemblage probably a dyspnea with a
dilation of the coronary arteries and mi-
tral regurgitation he said in other
words his pump blew up-heart disease
look at the color of his face

  you cant see much of it for the
whiskers chief mason said

  look through his whiskers james
lee suggested not through them but
under them

  the chief of police frowned
  meaning wha 

  lee turned the dead mans head to the
left under the labyrinthian growth of
beard on barbossas right jaw there
were three small abrasions that centered
in the dark area of an oval bruise two
inches long somebody clipped him
with a right to the jaw lee said
-someone who probably wore a heavy
ring set with three stones a right-
handed man five or six inches taller than
barbossa

  its a bruise all right dr gale ad-
mitted it looks as if somebody socked
him in the jaw

before he died james lee added
thats right dr gale said other-
wise it wouldnt be black and blue
are any of the cooks around the place
addicted to a kitchen drink known as a
gentle annie   james lee asked

  what kind of a drink is that  chief
mason exhibited quick interest in the
question

  it was named on the mississippi riv-
er james lee said it is a blend of
lemon and vanilla extract fifty-fifty


the chef dutch miller is a nut for
that stuff sam webb volunteered lis-
ten-hes got a ring like you spoke about
go ahead mr lee chief mason
suggested whats the dope

  theres a goblet out on a table in the
pastry-room half full of the stuff lee
said greasy fingerprints on it will spot
your man without much trouble if you
will look at the rubber heels on bar-
bossas shoes you will see that they
have been dragged across a floor that was
covered with pine sawdust theyre
scratched and there iis some sawdust be-
tween the rubber and the leather you
will find some wool fibers on them red
and green probably from the rug in the
dining-room youll see where barbos-
sas heels dragged across the rug there
is sawdust in the cu of his pants and
if you will ruffle his hair you will find
some more from the floor of the refrig-
erator-room

  i dont get you chief mason said
if you will look at the door of the
refrigerator-room you will get me
james lee suggested

  you mean barbossa was penned up in
the refrigerator-roon 

  i think so james lee said clipped
in the jaw for a knockout penned up-
and frozen to death he turned to dr
gale the body was ten or fifteen de-
grees colder than room temperature when
i got here half an hour ago

  thats right the doctor said i
wondered what made him so cold

  if you will look at the temperature-
control outside of the refrigerator-room
you will see that it has recently been
turned to the low side of zero lee con-
tinued thats not done in these meat-
coolers finally-barbossas fountain
pen it is one of the kind without a
rubber ink-sac he turned to chief
mason you saw the big ink-stain on
the lining of barbossas vest-still moist
fresh the barrel of the pen is broken
the ink froze while barbossa was in the
refrigerator expanded split the barrel
and leaked out

well case chief mason comment-
ed thats about all-except the
motive and the killer

  at this finding an appropriate vent for
his venomous rage cabral exploded
you dumb police hick theres a rea-
son all over the place he snarled who
was the last dame that lousy old chaser
went for

  nix on that stuff sam webb ob-
jected leave her out of this

  leave who out of it chiefmasons
tone suggested that he intended to blast
the information out of someone if he
could obtain it no other way

  dolly jose cabral sneered dolly-
hottest number of our floor show she
happens to be the cooks daughter if
you want the guy that killed mutt bar-
bossa hunt up dutch miller mutt done
her plenty wrong-and dutch bumped
him

  id clip you if you was loose sam
webb threatened dolly is a good girl
dutch done right

lee turned to face the watchman is
a that straight stuff  he asked does
cabral know what hes talking about
sure its straight stuff sam webb
admitted everybody knows that bar-
bossa jumped down to hollywood on a
plane last week for a three-day trip with
dolly

  to chief mason dutch millers your
man id say james lee advised

  sure hes my man i knew what was
going on between old mutt barbossa and
dolly a month ago ill have dutch
rounded up in ten minutes-and ill get
him cleared for killing barbossa let me
get on the phone

  just a minute lee requested when
you call your office please have a couple
of men come up here to guard the vault
in the bookkeepers room theres a
million dollars worth of opium in that
vault ill send for it tomorrow im
leaving now for san francisco

  sure i will mr lee anything you
want done is as good as done-with my
compliments

  thank you james lee turned to
joe blair go in there and put another
pair of links on cabrals ankles and
bring him along he directed we can
make san francisco by dinner-time if
we step on it

beggar holiday another story by hugh wiley will be a feature of our next

dr kaino sat up and looked
around he knew immediately
that his right leg was broken
below the knee a lucky es-
cape at that he reflected

 the russ plane was gone it had
swooped spat its storm of death and
winged away of kainos party half a
dozen riddled corpses were clumped in
the snow around the two sleds they had
been pulling the other four men who
had taken cover among the black blasted
grove of trees were half-heartedly emerg-
ing and calling to one another

  suddenly kaino was aware of a stran-
ger sliding up behind him on skis-a
tall rangy hard-eyed man kaino spoke
sharply but the other shook his head

  sorry dont know enough of your
lingo to shake a stick at

  good lord  broke out dr kaino
an american

sure the others face lit up but
never mind gabbing till i fix that leg
an efficient man thought kaino he
rid himself of the skis produced a first-

oijr

  bill jenkins takes sides in this
  war-and talks with that famous
  old soldier gustavus adolphus

aid kit examined the wound and quickly
covered it against frost

  leg broken might be worse well
take care of it down in the dugout he
said tried to signal you to take shel-
ter but that damned plane was too fast
im parson joe hitchcock-used to be a
college professor hence the name how-
come you talk american 

  i am american man-american of
finnish descent a surgeon i was
making a round cf these isolated de-
fenses aiming to reach no  should
be close by

  it is any relief on the way
  afraid not
  there was a terrific concussion must
  have been a direct hit overhead

opening yet the finns battled doggedly
on hoping against hope

  upon gaining the battery emplacement
hidden among the trees dr kaino was
really astonished when he was carried
down into the subterranean quarters
here were two big rooms one containing
the bofors guns the other for living-
quarters but here with parson joe were
only three men and none of them was
finnish nor were these men soldiers

  where are the gun-crews demanded
dr kaino as parson joe laid bare the in-
jured leg with bandages and splints
ready wheres the garrison

  out in the snow doc-rather un-
der it i think a gas shell got in here
weve been here two dajs already-came
just before the attack started tell your
men to go bring in your second sled be-
cause we need all the grub you have
then grit your teeth and hang on while
i set this leg

  dr kaino gave the order after this
the pain sent him into a merciful coma

  yet his last memory was one of lin-
gering astonishment he knew this par-
ticular battery had been hard at work all
day yesterday a thrust from the rus-
sians had been hammered back the ice
of the bay outside was even now heaped

  the rangy hitchcock looked at the pile
of dead men waved his arm at the four
survivors and kaino translated his or-
ders to them with the wounded sur-
geon on a sled hitchock led them all in
among the trees

  march was already passing but still
everything was snow and ice here on the
shore and there along the seacoast and
the far islands where the russians lay
for viipuri had all but fallen now the
hammer and sickle were pounding and
slashing at the outlying batteries which
still defended the coast these under the
unceasing swarms of planes were falling
one by one and the way to helsinki was

with corpses how then when only four
men had been here 

  he learned the answer when he came
to himself after a slug of aquavit and a
cup of hot tea his own men were carry-
ing up ammunition from a still deeper
dugout around him were parson joe
and the other three and tobacco-smoke
was blue in the air

  oh were just neutrals said parson
joe cheerfully whats the name
kaino well doc meet the gang we
belonged to the third ambulance sector
the one that came up here from paris last
month heres bill jenkins a yank like
me this is jan philp a hollander and
p

this is oley-hes got some norwegian
name but we call him oley and let it
go at that he put up most of the money
for the ambulances

  and you put up the brains grunted
jenkins solemnly he was tall and thin
and dark with strange bulging eyes
they all had the queer hard strained
calmness that is unnatural and tells of
a past almost beyond endurance

  and philp the schnapps spoke up
oley young and bright of face i wish
we had more of that good hollands 
well-bill jenkins rose with his
grave solemnity-id better go out and
have a talk with those dead men of yours
doc they may need a steer to get em
started right its always sort of a shock
they tell me when it happens sudden
he went out the others exchanged a
quick glance parson joe spoke quietly

  doc just dont be surprised at any-
thing bill says you see we were at the
no  hospital a few days ago we got
here from there somehow i dont right-
ly know how  yes we were sta-
tioned there when the reds bombed it
three days ago incendiary bombs gas
and machine-guns that ended our unit
for good and bill went clear off his nut
but hes harmless so dont take him too
seriously

 dr kaino who had seen horrors
enough felt a thrill of fresh horror that
no  hospital clearly marked and iso-
lated had been deliberately destroyed

  you finns said the dutchman a
heavy stalwart young man should ex-
act payment for some of these brutalities
you should bomb those russian cities
were not barbarians said dr
kaino they are i will tell you about
colonel peter kalevala then you will
understand

  not now cut in parson joe with de-
cision you save your strength therell
be another raid before dark i expect
ill want your four men to do scouting
tonight were about done up worked
like hell yesterday

  did you work these guns demanded
dr kaino

  parson joe grinned hungrily were
neutrals doc benevolent neutrals we
work hard at it come on oley lets
get that soup fixed up

kaino lay silent wondering his
four men elderly veterans refused
for active service ancl put into hospital
work were jubilant they were loading
clips for the -mm bofors guns four

shells to a clip oley made them com-
prehend that two of the four guns were
jammed but they grinned and said they
could be repaired this oley was a
blond serious young giant the youngest
of the four parson joe was the oldest

presently bill jenkins came in
hey parson  he called i can
hear em but cant see em must be
high i wastalking to king gus he
says the reds are fixin to attack at sun-
up from the two islands to the north
and that a feller named gizeri is with
em

  dr kaino swallowed hard at this name
gizeri there was io time to think how-
ever parson joe barked an order kaino
was lifted and carried into the living-
cjuarters the massive doors were slid
shut a lamp was lit parson joe came
and sat beside the doctor

  we carried twenty-odd corpses out of
here he said casually i guess they for-
got to close those doors and a gas-shell
landed too bad the place was de-
serted glad of your men to help-it
was damned hard work feeding those
guns yesterday

  i thought you said you were neu-
trals said dr kaino

  yeah you should have seen those
incendiary bombs hit no  hospital
parson joe glanced up as jenkins clrifted
over to them what you want bill 

  jenkins lit a cigarette and nodded in
that queer spasmodic way of his

  gus says theyre bombing heavy all
along the coast and not to open up till
he gives me the word i got a date with
him for later tonight he says a guy
named richard licnheart will be along
ever hear of him 

  often replied parson joe in the
soothing tone one uses to a child

  well he says he has a message for us
said jenkins with finality then sat down
and smoked his eyes fixed on nothing

  good god  murmured dr kaino
looking up at the hard thinly chiseled
face of the american above him he
seems perfectly normal-how the devil
did he know about gizeri 

  does it mean anything asked par-
son joe

  yes its what  want to tell you men
about

  oh well bills been crazy as i say
since that hospital went up he had a
girl there one of the nurses she was
about where one of the incendiary bombs
hit and we had just finished painting
there was no danger in getting out under the sky now that day was done

an enormous red cross on the flat roof
too cleaned the snow off to do it
they must have run the building up in
a hurry to put a flat roof on thats no
kind to have in snow country-

  what did jenkins meanf about rich-
ard lionheart intervened drskaino

  for a moment the hard blue eyes of
parson joe searched his face

  bill isnt what ycud call educated
he rejoined slowly that makes it hard
to understand i suppose anyhow hes
been talking to some body he calls king
gus-gustavus adolphus presumably
now accept things as they are doc
dont lose your grip bill may be stark
insane but all he wants to kill is rus-
sians he wont hurt us

  dr kaino forced himself to acquiesce

  soup had been heated everyone had
some with hard bread and sausage find-
ing that the lot of them must remain here
until the savage persistent searching air-
raid up and down this sector of coast was
over kaino relaxed

  call your friends he told hitch-
cock ill tell you about colonel peter
kalevala and this gizeri it may be a
needed warning to you especially in your
present guise as benevolent neutrals
hitchcock grinned and his friends
gathered around dr kaino

  this happened during the very first
fighting at petsamo he told them col-
onel peter had been trained in germany
and had a full battery there at petsamo
now the ancient law says it is not mur-
der to kill russians who are brute beasts
but at that time none of our people want-
ed to kill and colonel peters battery
did dreadful execution on those reds un-
til it made men sick to see so when the
foremost ranks of russians waved white
flags they stopped firing

  those ranks of russians ran forward
they waved their empty rifles showing
that they had no more ammunition they
waved their empty belts they wanted
to surrender and our people were very
glad of this so the russians flooded
over the lines in a mass and foremost
among them was gizeri-he was a finn
who had joined the reds he had served
the reds as a spy in helsinki

  the russians had bayonets fixed to
their rifles once in the lines they at-
tacked our people with the bayonet
gizeri killed colonel peter the bat-
tery was captured this little trick we
have later learned is among the arts of
war taught in moscow and now our
people do not cease firing while any rus-
sians are in sight

that was the story dr kaino told
them as though to emphasize it he
had barely finished when the earth shud-
dered  then a second time

those bombs came close said par-
son joe and looked at jenkins how
did you know anything about gizeri
i told you said bill simply gus
said he was there

  they glanced at one another uncom-
fortably

  damn it  exclaimed jan philp i
suppose bill will be talking to me tomor-
row or next day and i dont want to
die

  you will though bill jenkins
looked at him seriously i can see the
queer kind of light around your face now
that shows it

  parson joe stifled an oath and me
i suppose

  sure replied jenkins soberly sure
all of us except the doc here if we
want to send out any word to anybody
better give it to him i got a message all
ready

dr kaino spoke a little impatiently
im surprised at you fellows talking
this way why dont you buck up and
show some common sense instead of
yielding to superstitious fancies 

  the four men regarded him he per-
ceived in surprise and even vexation

  you dont have much common sense
left doc said bill jenkins reflectively
when you see those russian bombs

tlic whole frorital attack was suicidal

spouting fire around wounded men and
women especially the woman who loves
you

  ive been bombed half a dozen times
said dr kaino impatiently

  sure but youre just a good doctor
retorted parson joe

  what the devil do you mean by that 

  parson joe regarded him thoughtfully
y know doc man is retrogressing
back home weve seen the japs bomb
hell out of china  the same thing has
happened in half a dozen countries and
were used to it then finland comes
along and fights and a lot of us have
waked up take me for instance

  i was in paris on my sabbatical year
working for an extra degree and my
wife skipped out with an italian noble-
man she met at the opera so what
my world went to pieces and i met oley
and here we are with an ambulance sec-
tion-or were until the reds bombed it
out of existence it needed some inside
but tho russian strategy was to sacrifice masses of men in order to overwhelm

trouble to wake me up and make me feel
for the troubles and sorrows of others
thats what being civilized means if the
world remains callous to such things we
drift back into the decadence of roman
times

  gosh  you sure talk like a professor
parson exclaimed bill jenkins

  the hollander grunted impatiently
of course after all were jiere what
matter if we die tomorrow then were
ended i came along because im bored
with life the quicker we die and make
room for someone else the better

  and no future life questioned dr
kaino

  philp shrugged o course not

  bill jenkins chuckled but said nothing
the norseman blond oley gave a laugh
and touched match to cigarette

  id like to hear why bills here   said
he cheerfully as for me its simple
enough all my money went at auteuil
on a poor horse i cabled home and found

that the firm was bankrupt so i joined
parson joe sold off what i oeuld kissed
my girl-friend good-by and put the
money into ambulances and here we
are or were now bill 

  jenkins grinned at him me oh
i just got an itchin foot i guess i had a
job in the american bar and met up
with marie she was coming on this
trip nursing so i signed up and came
too he glanced around with a puzzled
expression funny i havent seen her
here yet but gus said id see her today
sure

  better see that the air ventilators
open bill parson joe said calmly

  jenkins got up and left them dr
kaino spoke quickly

  that mans in a dangerous state
youd better realize it

  i guess so philp said carelessly
not dangerous to us though    doc
is it true the government is making peace
with moscow


  there are rumors kaino shrugged
the ends inevitable i fear weve no
more men the artillery is nearly all use-
less-the guns are used up peace of any
kind would save a remnant of finland at
least

  this whole finnish war was started
by germany exclaimed parson joe
its no secret that the nazis egged the
russians on and they threatened to at-
tack sweden if any allied troops were
given passage to finland its they
whove destroyed this country-not the
soviets the one to blame is the mad-
man in berlin

  he checked himself abruptly as jen-
kins came back to them and spoke up

  thats right say i forgot i had a
message for you doc gus says never
mind if peace is made if finland loses
out if everything does go wrong even if
the nazis do come out on top

  he says not to mind  dr kaino re-
peated

  jenkins nodded solemnly he says
greater forces than anyone realizes are
fighting against the nazis and he says
everything is going to end up right if
you just tell em whats needed

  very well said the surgeon soothing-
ly ill tell them just what is needed

  faith and courage replied bill jen-
kins and wandered away as though the
subject were closed once again the
earth shuddered then twice more close
together these bombs had been close

  dr kaino glanced around at the un-
shaven faces thought of what he had
just heard and blinked it was real
yet he had an eerie sense of unreality
about this place and these men

  he had heard about no  hospital be-
ing completely wiped out by a bombing
fleet these four men must have been
through hell and worse no wonder they
were a bit queer in the head it was a
marvel that they had any sanity at all
left

  faith and courage  that was a
queer prescription thought kaino he
knew only too well that finland was
doomed he knew how the army was
fighting on savagely stubbornly with no
desire for peace he also knew that peace
alone could save what remained of the
army and how the huddled populace was
being swept by disease and death

  theres something to what bill says
parson joe was speaking gravely if
the world has faith collectively in the
outcome of things if the people have
faith in the right then itll pull through

the gun jumped
under his hand
all those bullets
went to one spot
if the world has courage itll pull
through

  and if not  asked philp with a cyn-
ical glance

  then well all revert to barbarism and
perish not our civilization thats not
threatened nazi civilization is out-
wardly similar to ours its the ideals
that differ past systems like rome have
died the same way-pulled down bit by
bit destroyed piecemeal by the hordes
perhaps bill does see clearer than the
rest of us doc    where you from
back home

  minnesota said dr kaino my
wife and i came to take charge of a hos-
pital at viipuri and did until the russ
bombed us out my wifes gone to stock-
holm now with a nervous breakdown
youre lucky observed philp sage-
ly wagging his head mine gave vie a
breakdown

  parson joe winked wife trouble
thats why jan is here

  maybe maybe not the hollander
smiled thinly anyhow i dont want
to die yet a while ive got a lot to make
up for before the end comes thats
realty why im with this ambulance unit
or was i wanted to sign up with the
french but they hadnt started the war
yet and i had to get away from my wife
so here i am

  hard thought dr kaino for the man
to confess his real ambition-a lot to
make up for the thin and careworn
features of the surgeon relaxed a trifle
as he looked at the faces above

  if we get out of here alive he said
you might throw in with me my wife
will be back with a couple of ambulances
were going to work among the children
in the civilian camps half of them are
down with disease of one kind or an-
other

  wont be any camps left when the
reds get through bombi ng grunted par-
son joe

  dr kainos face twisted sharply this
statement was only too true

he dozed presently he woke looked
around the four were tossing coins
a laugh broke from oley as he rose

  all right i am it-what is it you say
in america  the sheep 

  no the goat said parson joe
good luck well all get on the door
must be near dark outside

what are you doing kaino asked
going to see if theres any gas out-
side said oley carelessly and went to

the massive doors of steel and concrete
with the others

  dr kaino understood one man cho-
sen by lot if there should be gas around
only one would perish

  the door slid back a little oley
squeezed through it was rolled shut be-
hind him and the silence of suspense fell
upon the room the four elderly men
who had come with dr kaino were
asleep they had marched long with
those sleds

  dr kaino never forgot this one mo-
ment of absolute silence the air quivering
with nervous tension every thought fol-
lowing the blond young man who had just
gone out he was risking his life with
a laugh for the sake of all and these
shelters built without the fear of gas in
mind were traps at times

two blows sounded on the door and
the tension broke

  everybody out cried parson joe
help me with the doc bill 

  out of course meant more than just a
return to the gun-room there was no
danger in getting out under the sky now
that the day was done and the long night
starting and get but they did even
building fires in a hollow among the trees
-a new hollow where a bomb had
landed the sky was greening into deep-
er blue and the stars were pricking out
their faintly winking patterns upon it

  heres a fag doc parson joe came
over to dr kaino and sat down philp
is doing the supper nothing fancy but
itll be grand wish youd arrange with
your men to keep watch tonight the
russ might try a night attack

  wait said the surgeon nows
your time to pull out of here

 why

  why you confounded idiot four
men cant work these guns against an as-
sault  

  parson joe chuckled we made a
damned good bluff at it then and what
we did yesterday we can do tomorrow
besides weve got your four men to
help now

  but theyll bomb and machine-gun
this place out of existence 

  we figure so said parson joe
know anything about working those
guns

  no

  they have a predictor mechanism for
aiming but i expect thats only against
airplanes we cant get the hang of it
still we can aim by hand all right i

the blue book magazine

think the rifling is about gone theyve
been used so much but if we can lay
down a hundred shells per minute out
on the ice a mile to a mile and a half
distant we dont need to worry about be-
ing exact the guns have a faster speed
but thats as fast as we can work em
well how about sending you away with
your men nothing to stop you

  to hell with you said dr kaino
i think youd better send one man how-
ever to take news not that theres any
help to spare but-

 then we need the one man right
here said parson joe definitely

  oley strolled up they came close
this time the snows going out before
long parson in norway its all gone
now but theres no gulf stream here to
warm the land more bombs tomorrow
theyll give us a good one what are you
frowning about

  scared said parson joe scared as
hell if you must know

  oley laughed at this but dr kaino
lying there under the stars knew it was
true hitchcock was afraid yes all the
braver soul for that

  supper came with jan philp bragging
and posing as a chef and dr kainos
precious liquor squandered in drinks he
did try desperately to reduce this mad-
ness into some semblance of sanity but
he had no luck even his four men were
as roaring mad as the others they were
needed here they could strike a blow
against the russ and they meant to make
the most of the occasion

parson joe came and sat with dr
kaino and the two talked not of
themselves but of home the world of
men books and hobbies dr kaino again
perceived that this rangy man was ac-
tually afraid of the morrow afraid of fac-
ing it yet steeled himself to go ahead
here and seize the offered chance to strike
at the enemy

  you wouldnt guess it from my lingo
doc he said but it was english that

i	used to teach in college seems like ten
years ago now if you do pull out of
this alive as bill jenkins claims you will
youll have a story of three men bill and
philp and oley and what they did here
and how they left

  what about you asked dr kaino
  parson joe gestured impatiently

  i dont count not important bill
says youll pull through and maybe bill
does know a crazy guy may sometimes
have more on the ball than we realize

are you sure theres no help being sent to
these coast-defense units

  none said dr kaino i was sent
to give medical help where needed and
report back the defenses are crumbling
in the north the whole country is be-
ing swept by swarms of planes and no
help is being sent us in any quantity our
men are worn out dropping where they
stand weve no replacements

             -

afterward when the night chill
 was creeping upon them and two
of dr kainos men had gone out on the
far ice to scout the russian movements
bill jenkins showed up out of nowhere
and hugged the dy ing fire

  well i met tip with em he an-
nounced in a most matter-of-fact way
there was gus and this other feller
richard gus by the way says he was
born somewhere around here and rich-
ard was kidding him because his folks
were all german just the same this
richard hes english but a swell guy in
spite of it he says therell be a relief
party here about four tomorrow after-
noon if we can hang on that long he
and gus and a lot more are going over to
work on the russ commanders

  what do you mean by that asked
dr kaino

  jenkins shrugged heavily i dont
know something about trying to work
on their minds and inspiring them to do
the wrong thing he answered vague- 
ly and parson  they said to tell you
that all the hell you had back in paris
about your wife and so forth was just
like what the finns are having now like
some folks getting more than their share
of grief and if they keep their chin up
its just that much better for em later
on i dont savvy it very well nor what
richard said to tell philp

  to tell me spoke up the hollander
as though with frowning resentment

  yeah jenkins struggled to find the
words he says to tell you that all
death really means is another life

  philp scowled and there was silence
later back in the bombproof living
quarters dr kaino wakened from fitful
slumber to find oley the blond young
norseman sitting by him and writing
by candlelight

  a letter for you to take out oley
said seeing that the surgeon was awake
bill told me id better get it done to-
night

  surely you dont take any stock in his
insane vagaries asked dr kaino
four men at peace

  id say no to that except that they
hold a streak of sense queerly poor
devil when the nurses and wounded
men all went up in flames and his girl
too he was the most pitiful thing you ever
saw bills one of those men who seem
mighty tough but are not lifes been
a hard hard scrabble for him until marie
came along and showed him what it
might be then to have her end that way
before his eyes-you know how those
thermite bombs explode incredible heat
but after his brain snapped he seemed
to forget what had taken place so far as
any grief was concerred

  this king gus he talks about-could
it be that he means gustavus adolphus
well thats as near as we can figure
it oley said apologetically

  its a strange thing then said dr
kaino gustavus actually was a finn
by birth and a german by family may-
be jenkins remembers it subconsciously
oley smiled slightly and made no re-
sponse dr kaino with a feeling of irri-
tation resolved to abandon any effort at
beating sense into the heads of these men
perhaps they were all mentally affected
as the result of that no  hospital af-
fair by all accounts it had been un-
usually horrible

  not that such things were rare dr
kaino had seen more than one hospital
or civilian camp given its dose of destruc-
tion he was hardened and he like
many a greater soul had come to fear
lest the whole civilized world become
hardened also

  i suppose he said we can expect
some of molotovs breadbaskets tomor-
row not that theyll do much damage
here but they may roast us a bit

  oley nodded and went on writing
presently he finished it was a letter
he said to a girl in oslo who had jilted
him sending him to paris and a dissolute
existence but the life there had brought
him no peace he explained simply to
all four life had been a strtfggle almost
past bearing

  dr kaino remembered having glimpsed
this same thing in their faces at first

just before dawn everyone was astir
and kaino wakened he lay watch-
ing the men moving about in the
lamplight preparing food getting shell-
clips stacked ready near the guns his
old veterans had managed to repair a
third gun but the fourth was out of
service this left three of the bofors
and two machine-guns for close work

  to the crippled watcher the strange
thing about this experience lay in these
four men who by parson joes frightful
sarcasm were neutrals they consti-
tuted a fair cross-section of the men
whom kaino had already met fighting
for finland swedes americans poles
and hungarians and others but he had
got under the shell of these four he had
looked into their hearts he compre-
hended their private lives

here was bill jenkins in civilian
life a bartender-who now talked
with the ghosts of the dead an alien-
ist thought kaino might understand the
vagaries of this poor mental case who
was in such amazing contrast to philp
the thoroughly materialistic hollander
who had no beliefs whatever except that
life ended with death

  dr kaino was not sure about this him-
self  as he was wont to say he had ex-
plored thousands of people but had never
come across a human soul

  and the young norseman a wastrel be-
cause of some love-affair and parson
joe the rangy sardonic cheerful man
who was so born to command yet must
continually fight the fear within it was
the latter who came now to kainos side
and brought a tray for them both with
food and steaming tea

  when the fun begins he said you
might like to be placed in the lower room 
this upper one is bombproof of course
twelve feet of protection overhead but
the openings for the guns and the venti-
lators make it bad for gas and heat and
air-shock not to mention bullets once
they get our exact location theyll gun
us from the air

  these are anti-aircraft guns said
kaino

  parson joe shook his head got to
keep em trained on the russ column
these are contact shells and we cant
bother to fight hornets when bears are
advancing

  a word from philp who was watching
the old finn last out on guard was com-
ing in the stars were paling daylight
was at hand

  the finn arrived yes he reported
one could hear things out there on the
ice at this bill jenkins spoke up

  no hurry the planes will come first
they told me so

  dr kaino suggested that his men who
were all veterans might try their re-
paired gun on the planes to this par-
son joe assented carelessly and the four
-

whats that you say gus
made peace with the gods

elderly men went joyously to work elevat-
ing their weapon

   all hands ready to take cover said
parson joe by that east wall where the
doc is lying thats the safest place
wholl stand watch we must keep an
eye on the russ so they wont work up
under cover of the bombing

   i spoke up oley he went to one of
the gun-openings where a periscope was
installed and leaned over its polished
table brightening up fast he said
as though no one else knew it then he
fell silent watching the table intently
whats up asked jenkins

  queer oley replied flashes of
light high up in the sky to the south  
bombers catching the sunlight long
before we get it said parson joe calmly
to the south eh coming from their
bases in esthonia better take cover
everyone

the four old finns paid no attention
clustering around their gun all the
others except oley moved over alongside
dr kaino the gun-embrasures opened
only on the shore and gave scant view of
the sky the two machine-guns were
placed in forward bays of concrete yth
wider scope oley however had the
only means of getting a view all around

   parson joe explained to dr kaino as
they smoked that here the russians
could not come ashore to north and south
because of the high cliffs they must land
directly opposite the dugouts this made
it very nice for the bofors guns he ob-
served with his sardonic smile

   looks like columns forming and tanks
advancing said oley

  let plenty of them come philp
spoke up we figured yesterday that
the windrows of corpses and the two
tanks we smashed were about a mile from
shore better let em come that far par-
son

  parson joe nodded oleys voice came
calmly but with a vibrant stir in it

   tell your four ancients to get ready
doc planes are dropping    lord a
regular river of them coming across the
sky 

  his report was not needed the air
was a-quiver with the distant slowly in-
creasing drone the lamp was put out
daylight filled the place now oley re-
ported that four tanks were pushing
shoreward across the ice but not rapidly
and the main body of russians had halt-
ed the drone mounted by degrees to a
roar steadily and inexorably increasing


until nerves and flesh revolted against
the unending vibration

  and then it came without any warn-
ing a terrific ear-splitting crash so close
that the air-shock filled the entire place
two of the old finns were hurled to the
floor to dr kaino it seemed that the
guns and the walls shook like cloth hang-
ing in the wind the two old men picked
themselves up bleeding at nose and ears

  well said parson joe that was a
close one    oh hello give us a
hand philp

  they picked up oley and then they
laid him down again by the opposite
wall and parson joe covered his face

  i told him so last night said bill
jenkins nodding what did it 
shell-splinter looked like replied
parson joe to the brain a quick end
dr kaino stared astonished at all this
hardly able to realize that oley was really
dead and beyond help it seemed a mat-
ter of course to the others then he be-
came aware of continuous shocks bombs
must be falling everywhere the roar of
engines dinned out every other sound

  there was one terrific burst of heat
kaino did not need to be told what had
happened as he saw the others looking at
th periscope table one of molotovs
breadbaskets as the finns called the
fiendish cluster of tiny thermite bombs
had sprayed its contents somewhere near
the columns of roaring flame were spout-
ing with incredible hea t that seared every-
thing within a hundred feet

  the trees are burning said parson
joe watching thats bad may make
smoke to cloud our vision    no the
winds from the north alls clearing
hep look out all 

  everyone scattered after a moment
kaino saw why  he heard the roar of div-
ing planes and then the bullets began to
hit those russians knew now where the
dugout was the old finns were at work
kaino saw their long gun-barrel jumping
saw them break into yelljysg glee but
heard nothing after a moment there
was a terrific concussion it must have
been a direct hit overhead but nothing
happened here

a ll clear for the moment came the
voice of parson joe better get
to work all hands  

  dr kaino came to one elbow

  lift me  he commanded put me
up by one of those machine-guns i can
work it if needed and meanwhile can
take care of anyone who gets hurt

  not much shelter in those embrasures
from bullets replied parson joe

  does it matter

  at this they grinned and lifted him
he could work the machine-gun at least
while the drum was in place this would
only be at a pinch

here he had a view of what was hap-
pening the trees out around were
ablaze from thermite bombs something
else was ablaze down the shore-two of
them his old finns had actually
brought down two planes and there
out across the ice were four tanks com-
ing in and behind them dark masses of
men and the sun rising already high

  how much time had passed  impos-
sible to say the senses stood still and
an hour seemed but a minute dr kaino
found himself astonished that the sun
should be so high he wished for binoc-
ulars but there were none

  the guns were jumping the -mm
bofors were not large guns at all but
those long and sharply conical shells
pumped out with incredible rapidity and
precision were terrible when they ex-
ploded and they pierced tanks like pa-
per as kaino knew he strained his
eyes against the sunlit east watching

  one of the tanks turned and went
scrambling back the others did not
one smoked heavily afire one turned
over on its side the third just stopped
and its crew tiny dots of men appeared
and ran back over the ice while dr n
kaino was still watching he heard a yell
and saw philp at the periscope table
then he heard the planes but did not see
them at all for a long time they came
from behind from westward and zoomed
up so swiftly that they were hardly seen

  bombs first then the planes swung
flying low above the trees they had
the position exactly spotted and emptied
their guns at it as they flew past the
four old gunners had no chance to shoot
or aim now

  dr kaino crouched desperately mak-
ing himself small so did the others bul-
lets whined and shrieked in through the
embrasures those planes must have
formed an endless undulating circle the
roar was incessant occasionally the earth
shook as bombs came close blowing the
snow and the burning trees afar

  kaino felt someone touch his foot it
was philp supporting one of the old
finns they slumped down together and
philp tried to talk but could not that
bullet must have found him as he stood

helping the finn it had gone clear
through him the finn had a grisly
head-wound there was little to be done
for either man kaino attended to them
then dragged himself to one side and
looked around the place was hazy but
only with fumes from the guns and a
shell the other three finns were dead
around their gun which was knocked
awry a small shell of some kind per-
haps from the russian column had
entered the embrasure and exploded

parson joe was slaving at a gun
with bill jenkins philp to kainos
amazement and protest got to his feet
and went to help them but he did not
last long the wounded finn died quiet-
ly while kaino was pouring a drink be-
tween his lips

  it was unreal lost under a roar of
sound like a dream kaino found him-
self staring staring he had seen death
and horror enough yet this was possessed
of a frightful unreality

  there was some sort of interregnum
he was aware of silence that must have
lasted for some time he found parson
joe beside him propping him up pouring
some brandy into his mouth lighting a
cigarette for him

  what happened  he asked blinking

  i guess you forgot you had a bum leg
and tried to give me a hand the rangy
american grinned but had a wild look in
his eyes take it easy doc we broke
em and if they try again bill and i will
have a gun each i guess bills loading
the clips now and dont you ever say
guess  never mind if i did youre learn-
ing english remember thats a word
from the american language-

  he broke off laughed at himself and
took a drink of brandy kaino did not
blame him for wanting a drink and more
drinks until mind and spirit reeled
kaino himself felt impelled to queer ut-
terances

  still afraid are you  he asked look-
ing hitchcock in the eye

  hell no ive got all over that said
the other and for the first time in my
life i can understand something why
all the great heroic legends and sagas of
the world are concerned with the death
of heroes all of em sigurd roland
grettir achilles-christ i used to think
it was a mistake now i know better
how benkei the old japanese hero came
to his death is a wonderful story i can
appreciate it now what counts doc
is how you die-and why why thats

it doc i know how id teach those old
stories if i ever went back to college
how and why-thats what counts 

  bill jenkins came over to them

  say parson   lie said seriously wag-
ging his head gus was in just now he
says theyre going to make one more try
but there wont be more planes   
weve only got one gun we can aim the
rifling is clear gone from the other one
still it can be used all right against a
column gtfs says the relief party will be
here by four sure

  strange thought kaino the man
spoke of impossible things yet seemed
calm and grave and quite sane looking
at his watch the surgeon was amazed to
find that noon was upon them

  conscious of the death around him dr
kaino felt in his heart the truth that these
men all of them had dared much for
scant winnings to them more lay in the
playing than in the victory this was the
essence of a mans teaching he thought
then he returned to normal as parson
joe came to him with steaming bowls of
soup

  bill hotted it as the britishers say
said hitchcock cheerfully y know
doc were-	

  a shell screamed and struck somewhere
just outside bursting in the snow the
russians had a batery of light artillery
at work other shells began to hit all
around the dugout talk was ended
parson joe and jenkins however made
no effort to use the two ready guns they
waited keeping a sharp eye on the enemy

  the shelling continued for an hour it
did no particular carnage

  dr kaino was fighting the pain of his
hurt leg he roused out of this abruptly
to find parson joe at one gun bill jen-
kins at the other exchanging a few words
about the aiming he twisted swiftly
and looked out through his aperture

they were coming a dark swarm of
figures advancing on the ice already
reaching those windrows of putrescent
death that marked their former effort
they had spread far out widely as the
bay permitted where the ice was smooth
the sheen of steel flashed in the sunlight
with rippling movement steel of helms
and bayonets kaino caught his breath
as he squinted at the swarm against
two men

  all right bill said parson joe calm-
ly after a moment

  the bofors began their incredible bark-
ing twice every second until the two
four men at peace

men slowed their effort no gun-crews
here to keep the clips fed

  the incessant rain of shells was burst-
ing all along that far line a mile distant
white puffs everywhere the line flowed
on but the ice remained black and mo-
tionless in its rear and then from far
right and far left two little groups of
running men broke from the mass spurt-
ing ahead then two more groups four
in all running in loose open order what
it meant kaino could not tell

  get em bill shouted parson joe
theyre bringing up machine-guns  

it seemed suicidal but the whole front-
al attack was suicidal all the rus-
sian strategy in this war was to sacrifice
masses of men in order to overwhelm

  one of the groups scattered and van-
ished the column was coming steadily
on behind them shells sprayed that col-
umn relentlessly then the aim was
switched again shells struck and ex-
ploded all around the three remaining
groups they kept coming on they were
getting in close to the shore-line now

  one blew into a litter of bodies the
other two came racing on one halted
bill jenkins yelled fiercely to hitchcock
a machine-gun was being set up both
the bofors converged their fire on this
gun these men the shells found their
mark at last men and gun became mere
black things on the ice

  dr kaino looked for the remaining
group and blinked it had disappeared
apparently it had vanished into thin air

  now the two guns directed a steadily
hurtling stream of shells at the nearing
column the ice seemed to erupt flash-
ing fire the open ranks moved amidst
this eruption and their numbers lessened
black specks littered the ice more thickly
the ranks of men melted the tiny fire-
flashes quickened along the ice

  we got em bill a jubilant yell
burst from parson joe keep it up

  the shells reached back teethe support-
ing column then returned to the front
ranks small a mere forty millimeters
it was not their size but their numbers
that made them so frightful to men in
the open and the russian ranks broke
they ebbed backward hesitated and
fled in a crowding panic-struck mob

  kaino found himself yelling hoarsely
-and then he ducked ducked again as
something whistled past his head there
on the ice close in was a spitting little
burst of gunfire nearly invisible in the
sunlight

  he had found the fourth machine-gun
group sheltered amid a few ice-hum-
mocks

  the bullets were everywhere in that
very instant of triumph they came with
appalling and incredible effect like sheer
wizardry like the invisible touch from
a dead hand of russian vengeance
everything happened in a minute now
they sprayed in at the gun-embrasures
an unceasing stream dr kaino heard
and felt them striking all around him
they were striking everywhere in the
chamber slapping into the walls-

  he looked and his heart froze for one
cold instant parson joe was hanging
over the rounded base of his gun-stand-
ard a limp thing that dripped red bill
jenkins was on hands and knees his head
hanging and swaying god 

  then dr kaino remembered the ma-
chine-gun at his hand

  he twisted himself around there was
no more pain now he could see the
flashes on the ice he had a full drum of
cartridges ready the gun jumped under
his hand all those bullets went to the
one spot when the drum was empty
everything out there was silent that
final group had passed with the rest
there was only the streaming rout of men
heading away in the distance

  wiping sweat from his face kaino
turned he dragged himself across the
floor one sight of parson joes dead
face was enough and he turned to bill
jenkins

  jenkins had somehow gained a sitting
position his back against the wall blood
was pumping from under his shirt and
kaino checked himself bill ignored him
completely and looking up at something
unseen in the air he grinned

  sure gus sure  he was saying but
in a faint voice sure i can see her
its darned nice of you gus to fetch her
   whats that you say made peace
with the gods-for they have given men
a just wage-and have justice on their
side i dunno about all that gus   
but weve all-all of us-found-

what it was they had found kaino
never learned for the faint voice
died but the relief column did come
at four oclock and dr kaino lived to
tell his story this is an amplification
of his report at the top of the report he
or someone else had scrawled the little
message bill jenkins had given philp
all that death really means-is anoth-
er life

the story thus far

wing dobussy awoke from
a nap on his cabin-boat-and
found himself in a flooded
forest instead of on the open
mississippi a girl in a big green canoe
was steering toward him

hi-i you she hailed look aout

i reckon yore a soft-paw or aint yo
jest naturally got no sense

i dont blame you for thinking so
he called back but im a stranger down
thisaway my first trip below the jump-
off at the ohio

dobussy and isbelle strake grew right
friendly and he decided to stay in this
dark corner country where a man could
do well hunting and trapping and such

    but a few days later he was hailed
 again-and in a sure different way

whats yo business strangeh de-
manded the older of two men in a fine
pirogue who held him up at the point of
their rifles

wild-crafting dobussy answered

trapping fishing frogs-

jes loafing thas all-jes a vaga-
bond  we don low no tramps er sech
trash down yeah no suh i rest yo
charge of no visible means of support

spicious character loiterin-all them
things pick im up duck 

and an hour later dobussy found him-
self a shackled slave among a score of
others beaten with a mule-whip if he
slackened in his labor at an illicit distil-
lery concealed in the vast swamp-the
property of old dolomen hatchie who
with his overseer duck wamber had kid-
naped the luckless wild-crafter

dobussy bided his time and one
stormy evening weeks later he heard a
sudden rifle-shot and the armed guard
pitched into the water at once dobussy
plunged into the undergrowth there was
no pursuit and he finally came to his
moored cabin-boat and neither he nor
anyone else saw the canoe of isbelle
strake as it sped away into the shadows

dobussy went back to that peonage
moonshine still-went back shooting he
shot up the guards then he freed the
other slaves set fire to the still-and
went back to his boat the story con-
tinues in detail

 late in the evening dolomen hatchie
 j and duck wamber arrived in the
 landing-bayou no one was around there
 and they went on beyond the loading-
 skids so thejtcould hide the pirogue where
 none of the help could find it then they
 cut across through the brake to the tram-
 way and found two of the push-cars on
 the rails this was queer as they were
 supposed to be chained back at the stock-
 ade so they couldnt be sneaked away

   with old hatchie on one end and
 duck kicking at the back of one of the
 cars they rolled over the hump across
 the trestle and up the ridge coasting
 down the slight grade to the stockade
 the stillhouse was sure quiet no pump
 was working no boiler was blowing off
 and no one was singing the way the
 darkies generally did late on the day-
 shift they coasted into the stockade
 yard snapping back a wheel-lock they
 stood looking through the big gallotvs-
 gate which was swung partly open they
 sniffed a dank strong smell in the air
 while wondering puzzled by the quiet

   hatchie gripped his - and duck
 held his - carbine ready as they
 slowly approached the stillery old
 dolomen turned to speak to duck-when
 suddenly a sharp quick-powder shot
 crackled from the dusk within the build-
 ing the old man cried out

   oh-a-ah 

   wamber had heard too many shots
 caught the sound of too many bullets
 thudding home not to recognize the
 thwack by his side now he saw the
 back of grandpaps black coat jerk away
 from his body deep below the shoulder
 a burst of flying dust following the fast
 slug coming through

   grandpap flung back hit the gate-
 post where he stood fighting toremain
 erect a tough old knot but his eyes
 bulged his mouth gaped open show-
 ing yellow snags of teeth behind the mus-
 tache screen then slowly he buckled
 knees and hips slumping down and
 duck deserted him bounding with yelps
 toward the standing timber a few yards
 distant humping dodging twisting as
 bullets slapped at him through the fence-
 poles of the stockade

  duck tripped and fell to his hands and
knees and he made three or four bounds
like a heavy long-legged-hound-dog
hardly slacking his running and scram-
bling getting to his hind-legs again and
protected by the screen of the high pole
stockade he at last rea ched the woods

 when duck glanced back he caught
a glimpse of somebody coming on the
run to the gate so he could see to shoot
better and not be whacking through the
screen that glanced the bullets and
just as duck rose bounding into the cov-
er a bullet hit his old - rifle square
in the breech breaking the weapon prac-
tically in two and knocking it out of his

hand the splash of the lead and cas-
ing tore through his hand stinging it like
a hundred wasps

  terror-stricken wamber hurdled over
logs crashed through brush ran till he
was breathless his heart thumping in tor-
ture till he dropped gasping there dark-
ness swiftly covered him

  dolomen hatchies daid wamber
whimpered and moaned hes bush-
whacked an killed up hes shot down
in cold blood 

  when at last he sat up in the black
velvety dark he could see a red glow off to
his right through the trees hearing a
thud he thought it was somebody drop-
the blue book magazine

ping a chunk of firewood he hoped it
was a camp of innocent honorable hunt-
ers he headed staggering in that di-
rection but it was a long way the red
light slowly kept growing brighter and
brighter and he could hear through his
ringing ears the roaring of the fire and
the thudding bursts at intervals

  when he could see the flames shooting
high above the trees he realized that it
was a building burning lighting up the
woods far and wide even then he just
didnt think what it was till suddenly he
came right out into plain view of the
scene he had been circling the way a
man does if he isnt plumb watchful

  his jaw dropped and his eyes bulged
the great hatchie stillhouse was afire
the guardhouse was going up too the
fire licking out through the near side
bursting up out of the crumpling sheet-
metal roof the dormitory shed had al-
ready collapsed the whole interior of
the stillhouse was a mass of dense black
smoke and spurting tongues of red flames
thrusting up around the big stills and
tanks duck knew the thick bulges of
fumes were from the inpourings through
the main feedpipes from the big tanks of
fuel oil still standing on their burning
platforms beside the big shed barrels
and barrels of proof liquor were burning
too mixing with the oil-a lake of blue
fire underneath among the spiling

  wamber could hardly believe his eyes
and ears the works began to tip and
squirm the new galvanized iron roof
curled up like paper as the growling be-
came throbs and hisses explosions fol-
lowed explosions barrels bursting stills
blowing up shooting out the smoke and
throwing up the metal plates like leaves
in a whirlwind-until the whole shebang
crumpled down in sagging collapse

  the fall crashed into the condensers
and boilers-neglected pressures hurl-
ing everything up again in fountains
debris and fragments of sheet copper fly-
ing like burning rags in all directions
fumes of sour steam and alcoholic evap-
oration rolled out boiling along the
ground and fluffed around duck scalding
him until he ran frantically tearing off
his blistering heavy shirt

running out on the tramway he
 hardly slowed on the middle push-
plank across the trestle then he cut
across to where he and old pap hatchie
had landed the pirogue in its hide-out
he rammed his hand into his trousers
pocket for his key trembling fingers

found it but then as he snatched his
hand out a branch a twig or something
switched the slip of metal from his power-
less grasp and he heard it tinkle hitting
something before it flipped and fell with
a quick tiny splash into the bayou

  frantically he seized the chain to tear
it either from the hole through the pi-
rogue bow or from the massive tree-root
but he couldnt budge it he had al-
ways been right careful to have a boat
tight-fastened so unauthorized scamps or
fugitives from the works couldnt use it

  back-tracking he jumped wide into
the tramway and headed along the rails
toward the swamp trestle across which
spikes and glass were laid everywhere so
the barefooted escapers couldnt cross
without cutting their feet to pieces un-
less they had a tramcar to transport them

back at the stillhouse if he had any
kind of luck hed be able to find
a skiff dugout or something in which
he could go out of the skip and down the
east fork of the albion by this time
too the scoundrel raiders and murderers
would be gone

  for years the establishment had been
ducks refuge his home his support and
his big opportunity-everything a man
could ask for he had had there so he
returned to it as a fox or swamp wolf
circles back to its den and follows its
runway-like a rabbit hunting its hollow
log or a coon its hollow tree of course
duck kept thinking it would never do
to lose his head if he did he was gone

  racing twisting turning through the
country he knew because he had hound-
ed men all over those bottoms himself
wamber began to see just what to do
remembering the mistakes the fugitives
he had chased had made so they got lost
he tried to profit by them he had the
big advantage of having good boots and
thick soles that rascal wing dobussy
had sure bought good leather ones

  he tore his hands on buckthorns and
he tripped on greenbrier he gashed his
cheek on a sharp dry snag so that he felt
it bleeding presently he heard the joy-
ful yelping of dogs striking full cry into a
fresh track his heart gave a terrific
thump-bloodhounds

  the baying rang and echoed through
the brake coming right along to duck
wamber who had hunted men for life
through those swamps the trailing cries
of the night were more dreadful than any
sound he had ever heard before he must
get to water swimming or wading to lose
swamp angel

 feispursuersor theyd tear him to pieces
 if they were the ugly strain theyd
 catch the smell of his blood-a posse
 must be after him the federals would
 hold against him his loyalty to dolomen
 hatchie

   staggering along the tramway weak-
 ened by weariness hunger and terror of
 being headed off or coming to a bush-
 whackers stand probably to be cut down
 by buckshot or bullets-he had to risk
 it he had nowhere else to go than cir-
 cle back

   ahead of him the red glow of the burn-
 ing stillhouse increased though his life
 depended on it he couldnt leave the
 tramway he just couldnt crawl through
 the thickety brake nor climb a tree he
 was so weary stumbling and staggering

  then behind him the bloodhounds
came leaping and bounding long ears
flapping yelping jubilantly

   snatching at his scabbards he found
 he had lost one of his revolvers but he
  still had one of his old reliables he
 drew it and let go into the shambling
 eager animals pitching at him with their
 eyes glaring and their mouths wide open
 showing their white teeth and wet red
 tongues the bullets flung them back
 on their haunches as they broke into
 squeals of mortal agony he dodged
 down and glared at bay back along the
 trail with his back to the fire looking
 for the posse-drivers but none came

   he thought of something he searched
 for grandpaps - repeater but it was
 nowhere around the dead man someone
 had stolen it and carried away the old
 mans cartridge-belt full of ammunition

   a norther was beginning to blow chill
 raw growling bringing drizzling rain
 that saturated him as he crouched where
 he had stopped to make his desperate
 stand he was so weak that he could
 hardly balance himself on his knees

  all at once duck wamber gave way
 going to pieces he had rgched the
 dreadful limit of exhaustion when mind
 and body can endure no more and he
 pitched forward on his face just within
 the gateway of the stockade

when wamber came to he was
soaking wet and as cold as the tram-
pled blue earth where he lay the fire had
burned down to a smudge from beneath
the blackened metal the fuel-tanks
were empty the rain was pouring out of
clouds that dragged through the tree-
tops the day was so gloomy so gray
so thick that he couldnt tell whether it

 was coming morning or if night was at
 hand the moaning of the gale filled the
 lonesome brake

  rousing himself with the feeling that
he had had a terrible nightmare wamber
struggled to his feet every muscle was
stiff chilled and sore he could move only
with rheumatic cramps hatchies body
lay right where he fell it wasnt a dream
the black-and-tan dogs he had shot were
sprawled stark where they fell at his feet
and then he moaned as he recognized the
stockade hounds in his panic fear and
weakness he hadnt recognized them

  that jes shows how scoundrel-mean
despicable hateful that murderous feller
is wamber muttered through chatter-
ing teeth

  rust was turning grandpap hatchies
revolver a dull red his own  was
staining eagerly he looked again for
grandpaps - rustless steel barrel
which had been the old mans pride but
that special made-to-order weapon was
nowhere to be seen those unprincipled
killing scoundrels had robbed the dead

mustering his will wamber shook
himself together sweat gathering
with the cold rain on his face he put on
hatchies wide-brimmed hat which was
far too big for him till he drew the cot-
tonmouth-skin rrbbon band tight all
that wamber had ever known all that he
knew and was or ever would be had
centered in that old man lying there dead
whatever duck wamber felt of any
faith belief joy or loyalty was wrapped
up in old dolomen hatchie-always in
predicaments he had fallen back on the
ideas and intentions of grandpap he
couldnt do that now though

  grandpap always said if anything
happened to git wetzel hatchie the
fustest thing  duck recalled dejectedly
i dont reckon that boys worth a damn
hes jest slick-haired sniffy quality-
eddicated book-learnt course i gotta
git word to him

  what had happened that would be
wetzels first question and duck had to
have a story to tell him looking around
he wondered on his own account too in
the dormitorys ruined entrance lay the
night guard shot dead in the cold ruins
of the living-quarters were two others he
couldnt tell which he reckoned all
the guards had been killed long guns
and short guns were scattered in the
ashes around the bodies

  hit warnt legal duck choked
they neveh had a fair chanct hit
werent federals scatterin court posse-
men neveh raided us course hits jes
a lawless murderin swamp angel bad
element come without warnin shootin
men down a man aint safe no mo in
this country i betteh git to go 

  scurrying in new alarm duck never-
theless swung grandpap in his arms to
the tram-car and then to the varnished
pirogue which he unlocked with grand-
paps key starting the outboard with
the body stretched in the bow he pike-
poled clear and headed through the land-
ing-bayou for the mississippi going at
full speed bareheaded-he had covered
the old mans face with his hat squint-
ing expecting any moment to be shot
duck wamber raced now

  murdered in cold blood low-lived
worthless killers who never drew an hon-
est breath never worked unless they had
to did that they had destroyed that
big business the law didnt provide for
that kind of scoundrel meanness such
men werent fit to live he suspected
wing dobussy but couldnt swear to it

  this wasnt ducks business but wet-
zel hatchies the old man had had more
faith in wetzel than his overseer had

  now well seef that boy amounts to
shucks  duck sighed he needs lots
of gumption to be half up to that dad of
hisn yas indeedy 

chapter viii

killing excitement quiets

the killing of grandpap hatchie
made a lot of talk still no one
seemed to know how or where it hap-
pened duck wamber brought the body
down old mississip in the famous var-
nished pirogue according to ducks
tell at the coroners inquest he and mr
hatchie were running out old survey-lines
by the blaze-marks up in the dark cor-
ner and the first thing duck knew he
heard a bullet hitting mr hatchie in the
chest the next minute the old man
pitched down on his face dead he was
shot through the heart

  i heard the shot  wamber testified
it sure sounded spiteful

  the jury verdict was that dolomen
hatchie had been shot down in cold
blood by an unknown person proceed-
ings were right short the authorities
conforming with the law people around
talked under their breaths

  as soon as wamber brought the body
a telegram was sent to wetzel up at the

university where he was post-graduating
studying special-extra laws he had just
won his degree when the word came that
his father had been shot down dead in
cold blood sheriff harker telephoned
the son exactly the circumstances as far
as he knew ducks holding back
plenty harker said i reckon i bet-
ter organize a posse and make him show
me just the spot-

  just hold yo horses sheriff till i
come wetzel said im starting im-
mediately when i arrive well discuss
whatever is necessary to talk about i
reckon duckll talk to me hed sure
better 

  scattering court was excited about
the murder old dolomen hatchie was
the leadingest citizen in those parts
they expected prompt action

wetzel hatchie arrived home with-
in thirty-six hours he found duck
waiting for him at the old mansion which
had belonged to judge stalcum till he was
killed up bushwhacked

  after judge stelcums death everyone
had been surprised when lotus stalcum
moved out and tie hatchies moved in
lotus was just a little girl and minus
brooner an attorr ey had represented her
interests apparently dolomen hatchie
had papers claims and agreements that
gave him the stalcum timber bottoms
around the court and the big mansion
and estate-everything but just a small
cottage with about an acre of ground and
enough money to raise the orphan lotus
till she could take care of herself she
had been well educated and was a pub-
lic and official stenographer-a typist
copyist and all those kinds of things
real bright she made a reasonable liv-
ing doing real well wetzel hatchie had
shined around her- a bit but she never
said anything-just froze him out   

  no posses went back into the dark
corner scatterings looking for the mur-
derer wetzel hatchie said wait and
justice waited if it had been old grand-
pap finding out about a murder he would
have reared and snorted and there would
have been posses manhunting all over the
dark corner looking for the killer but
wetzel hatchie was of a different kind
he was slim catty-moving quiet-the
smoothest stillest least readable man in
the bottoms sheriff harker did some
confidential inquiring among the swamp
angels to kind of satisfy himself about
the way things were no one seemed to
know a thing that had happened
  when the inquesting autopsying and
obituarying had run their course old
dolomen hatchie had the most popular
funeral that was ever held in scattering
court swamp angels town folks poor

whites qualities and officials darkies and
all turned out the remains were ex-
hibited in the mortuary and a steady
stream of people went through looking
at that old white-whiskered countenance

explosions barrels bursting stills blowing up

it had been said a million times he was
too plaguey mean to die that no bullet
would ever get into his hide it was so
tough-lead would just crumple against
him  but there he was plumb dead 

  no sooner was he buried than dolomen
hatchies being murdered flattened right
down to the quietest killing anybody in
the town remembered when anyone
spoke to wetzel he just looked at them
even at a woman cold and sharp

  mind yo own business thank yo
kindly  hed say

  many a nobody had made lots more
fuss getting killed up even the finding
of a swamp angel along a trail after a
dance or a mission-boat meeting had
more echoes loud talking around the
court was hushed down officially these
were orders people didnt talk to mere
acquaintances about it wetzel hatchie
just let it be known this was nobodys af-
fair but his own he would attend to it

  this killing was peculiar and dubious
not even a perfunctory reward was of-
fered for the arrest and conviction of the
killer perhaps wetzel hatchie didnt
care to throw money away just for ven-
geance  perhaps the authorities were
playing foxy lying low

one odd thing it just seemed as if a
shadow had been lifted off scatter-
ing court and the dark corner men
who didnt even know they were toting a
weight of difficulty and dread never
knowing when the old man would bear
down enjoyed a strange relief wetzel
hatchie quiet gentlemanly no threat
in his eyes was a right welcome change

  duck wamber old hatchies right-
hand man and constant companion was
the biggest surprise first thing anyone
knew he didnt have his blacksnake whip
one day in the courthouse square wetz-
el hatchie saw him starting to larrup
one of the mute-boys a poor white just
to hear him make funny noises

  cut that duck  wetzel snapped
sharp as clashing jaws that was the
last of ducks plaguing small boys and
helpless men grandpap used to chuckle
seeing duck strutting parading bump-
ing into people he met showing off but
wetzel hatchie stopped all this short

  wetzel and wamber went up the al-
bion every few days they met swamp
angel boats coming down passed camps
and shanties flatboats tied in-rag-shack
rough-board and painted cabin craft
wetzel always nodded greeting cour-
teously sometimes he stopped and



talked always politely he never asked
leading questions all he was doing ap-
parently was finding landmark corners
and running out timber-lot lines finding
the surveys according to his maps and
other papers

  always duck carried his - rifle
but this might rot mean anything be-
cause he shot a good deal of game more-
over it would be foolish not to be ready
for business just in case somebody bore
hard feelings about something or other

  then allof a sudden news came that a
sheriff off down the river away below
mendova had caught two men who had
whip-marks on their backs they were
brought to scattering court very confi-
dentially and all one night in the prose-
cuting attorneys office a bright light
shone men were heard crying out beg-
ging deputy sheriffs circled the court-
house square if anyone started along
the sidewalk opposite the bright windows
he was headed of told to go around

  the next day or two word shot through
all the dark corner that two men who
had been labor for old dolomen hatchies
industry back in ihe swamps of the dark
corner had been questioned-sharp
plenty of people shivered hearing that-
innocent and harmless swamp angeland
respectable ridge plantation families and
homestead whites-wondering worrying

  just when everyone thought the dark
corner and scattering court had settled
down with no hard feelings or mean ex-
pectations sheriff harker took a sheet
of paper over to the printing-office to
have dodgers struck off he ordered a
thousand of them and they were given
out all day to swamp angels farmers all
who came to town on trading monday
good readers read the notices out loud

 reward

    the undersigned will pay the sum of
  one thousand dollars for the capture of
  the man who murdered my father dol-
  omen hatchie this sum has been
  deposited in the scattering bank payable
  to the order of sheriff harker upon de-
  livery to him of the said killer

    the sum of  will be paid to anyone
  delivering to said sheriff the person of
  john doe alias wing dobussy at the
  scattering court and upon his conviction
  of the assassination of my father the
   above offered will be paid to who-
  ever brings said wing dobussy shanty-
  boater and river-rat to sheriff harker or
  enters him in our county jail

               signed wetzel hatchie
swamp angel

  autumn had come the leaves begin-
ning to turn and acorns were pattering
down on the dry leaves that had already
fallen people read or heard the news
naming wing dobussy swamp angels
had begun to speak arid breathe freely
now they shut their months stilled their
tongues the word was around that any
of them would do anything for a thou-
sand dollars even the swamp angels
shook their heads not trusting one an-
other theyd all seen wing dobussy
flitting around he had sold frogs tur-
tles mussel-shells and fish to buyers up
the albion and the other dwellers in the
dark corner met him here and there as
they were about their affairs

  the ink on that reward-paper want
hardly dry befo he had a copy of it
to read the news reached scattering
court and thereafter wing dobussy
was harder to see than a wild turkey hen
going to her nest

  to close friends swamp angels and
poor whites from up the albion admitted
that one thousand dollars reward-money
would be bad luck they didnt want
any of it most of them werent as poor
as some people thought but poor or rich
they had no hard feeling s against the man
-whoever he is-who had killed hat-
chie and quietened that duck wamber

  far and wide the rumor of the killing
had spread whispering at all the landings
on the lower mississippi how a man had
been abused and whipped put to work in
a big moonshine still stockaded in the
swamp brakes-till one day he had fled
in a cyclone instead of being satisfied
he had gone back and taken toll of all the
guards turning the helpless labor loose
and had shot old dolomen hatchie him-
self ending his pitiless regime of mean-
ness cruelty and greed no wonder the
killing had been hushed up

  all they want is to get their hooks on-
to wing dobussy  the word was around
they wont never bring him to trial if
they can ony ketch him xlieyll find
ways of gettin shut of him 

the talk carried a jeering undertone
a hundred people knew about do-
bussy and the only ones who would be
glad to cash in the reward were around
town where old dolomen had roistered
with some and used others probably his
big mistake had been feeling contempt
and hate against all the swamp angels

  wetzel hatchie found it was too late
to placate the wild-crafters back in the
brakes not one would even pretend to

answer any questions about wing do-
bussy-nor about hide-outs

  in all scattering court only lotus
stalcum probably came anywhere near
knowing just what was going on judge
stalcum had always been the swamp an-
gels friend his daughter knew them all
and they came to her cottage every trade
day people knew it wetzel hatchie
tried to take advantage of her friendships

  lotus he said to her we caint let
this murder of old grandpap dolomen
go unpunished you know how i feel
for your father was shot same as mine-

  no wetzel she shook her head
my father was resisting attempts to law
landholders to death taking their timber
and property your father was running a
peonage moonshine still theres a dif-
ference

  ive got five thousand dollars for you
personal if youll just find where this
wing dobussy hangs out  he kept his
temper with an effort

  no and her glance stung him

yet he paid lotus stalcum more
money than she had ever earned be-
fore  for she was the only one thoroughly
familiar with the papers in the county
clerks office hatchie had to have copies
of the land-records of the whole county

  she took the stained mildewed and
crackling papers and copied the colonial
spanish french old english and pioneer
documents and legal instruments-took
them home to work on with reading-
and magnifying-glasses this was confi-
dential work she knew that she made
exact copies-kept true carbons of each
one but no one knew this she certified
to each and every paper she recovered
from the old archives she even went to
mendova and to the state capital to gath-
er the data at wetzels expense he knew
of no one else who could do the work as
well and as cheaply

  wetzel hatchies law-coursing now
stood him in good stead he saved him-
self a lot of law fees and counsel money
handling his fathers estate claims the
way he did come to find out getting
right down to it there wasnt an acre of
land up the albion basin that was clear
in title no one knew what to expect
even out around scattering court in old
settled country

  working through the old land-records
copied by lotus stalcum checking
through them according to old dolomen
hatchies papers wetzel admitted him-
self he was never so surprised in his life
  course there they are if the land
belongs to the estate it does and thats
all there is about it just a matter of
law wetzel sighed sympathetic and
friendly and all that hut legislatures
made the laws and courts interpreted
them so what was a man to do if prop-
erty belonged to him by good rights 

  a trembly goose-pimpling chill ran
through scattering court and into the
far places of the dark corner no one
knew who was going to be hit next-tim-
ber-owner homestead-claimant planta-
tion ridger settlement-dweller ornery
no-account whites and proud upstand-
ing quality families all waited listening
to horses coming thudding or splashing
along the county pikes and byroads a
deputy bringing a subpoena or a summons
announcing actions of ouster or to quiet
title or some such lawing business insti-
tuted by wetzel hatchie as executor of
his fathers estate

  wetzel hatchie told lotus stalcum he
wanted and was going to get all the dark
corner

  what good will the swamp bottoms do
you she asked

  well see well see  he chortled

racing twisting turn-
ing tlirougli country he
knew because he had
hounded men all over
those bottoms himself
ho heard yelpingof dogs
full cry bloodhounds

hatchie had an engineer make a map
of the dark corner all the scatterings
territory and on this the hatchie hold-
ings were inked in red those with ques-
tionable claims against hatchies were
cross-hatched with red lines claims of
hatchie against  and-holdings of others
were indicated by straight bar lines
lotus stalcum had to help engineer
swone in the translations and reading of
the survey notes and records

  you cant get it all wetzel lotus
shook her head

  why not he demanded sharply

  there are rights you cant touch
she refused to elucidate this speech

  lotus did not quarrel with her bread
and butter she did her work so well that
she was indispensable she was quality
showing breeding of a type no son of
dolomen hatchie and his wife-whoever
she had been-could ever show wetzel
had never shown sipecial interest in girls
or women hints of clandestine attach-
ments had been bruited around but no
one questioned such things-it wasnt
safe

  friends of judge stalcum who knew
law had saved lotus a pittance of her
fathers estate dolomen hatchie had
begrudged it now wetzel hatchie sought
her friendship her kindness gratitude for
his giving her so much work with good
pay the mystery of her fathers killing
never had been officially solved wetz-


el hatchie knew however that lotus
stalcum held against him the same re-
sentment she held unvoiced against his
father

  to his cold heart came calculation and
desire in the university he had been
himself just a swamp angel fellow-stu-
dents seeing little distinction between the
uncouth youth and the other dwellers in
the dark corner swamps lotus stal-
cum had moved unquestioned where he
never had any standing for her father
had been a great man in the state yet
she was just a hired girl if one got right
down to it

  once he dared to tell her her place
but-

  are you white she asked you tell
a white girl she is toe proud just re-
member wetzel you have your place
too

  of all the things anyone had ever said
to wetzel hatchie that stayed with him
made him afraid among all his schemes
he included bringing lotus stalcum to
her knees his idea of power and place
was to be able to order and drive impor-
tant white men and women office-holders
anc quality people to do what he de-
manded hiring people paying them
half what they were worth-this was an-
other triumph of which he took full ad-
vantage and in which he took much sat-
isfaction

  just remember lotus he told her
ive hired you-as long as you do what i
tell you well get along

  as long as you keep your place ill
keep mine of course she said and all his
fine build-up collapsed

chapter ix

  the shooting of wing dobussy

uck wamber prowled restlessly
around listening drinking with men
to loosen their tongues cvffining dan-
gerous collecting gossip he brought
word to wetzel that a negro hand on a
commission fish-boat had seen wing do-
bussy delivering a thirty-dollar crate of
live jumbo-frogs big bulls on the east
fork of the albion

  he done promised anotheh load er
shipment the darky had said law

  ing northward in the direction of the
  dark corner all right duck weve

  stand this is my own personal affair
  shu-u yas suh-yas suh wamber
  beamed he had all along been fearful
  that wetzel might be soft liable to let
  things go now he knew old dolomens
  son was merely patient-a virtue old
  grandpap had not always possessed

  not outside duck shook his head
  those damned swamp-rats mind their
  own business theyre treacherous you

  they mought they hang together
  course this wing dobussys kind of an
  outsider theys positively scairt of that

  brush that scoundrel was your big
  mistake duck he had too much brains
  for you grandpap mustve fair warned
  you to look out for him didnt he
  oh yas-yas suh  wamber admit-
  ted but he neveh showed a sign-
  he knew better  wetzel said hes
  impudent mean and careless we know
  hell kill hes just a rat off the missis-
  sippi-a shantyboater thats all hes
  like a wolf-sly sneaking well have
  to go find him though hes our meat
  by now hes relaxed his vigilance all
  hes thinking is hes fooled us-got away
  
from us all hes thinking is about mak-
ing money-turtles frogging in our
swamps root-digging well just slip in
some day and surprise him-right 

  wambers face twitched and his eyes
blinked

  come on duck hatchie shrugged
his voice low you and i are going hunt-
ing now or dont you want to go-yo
fraid mebby

  a grin of delighted comprehension
suffused the ridges and lines of ducks
red-cabbage-leaf countenance hunting
-manhunting that would be in leash
these many months wamber had pos-
sessed himself with patience now he
was ready promptly with guns cleaned
ammunition in hand and the boat motors
with plug-points touched with emery
wetzel indicated the fancy varnished pi-
rogue as his choice for the pursuit the
best swamp water-craft and duck had
given the boat another coating of enamel
varnish as clear as crystal

  wetzel sat in the bow with his rifle
across his knees and that special -cali-
ber blued-barrel gold-plated-cylinder en-
graved-breech revolver in his snug fast-
draw holster-all ready for business
wetzel was dressed too in an old golf

suit with long-legged extra-soled moc-
casins and a faded woolen shirt-sure
handsome common and all according

  sit down  hatchie ordered as wam-
ber stood in the stern get a-going
stop that infernal racket

  duck loved the uproar of the open cut-
out of the motor the staccato explosions
and the quick echoes from the high
earthen banks and the colonnaded forest
brake walls old grandpap too had
liked the noise that way hearing only
just the cutwater hiss and the power
humming made duck wamber nervous

  full speed ahead shaving the current
edges taking advantage of the aeadwa-
ters and reverse eddies hitting the shoals
in the deep channels gain-speeding duck
never had had a chance to show wetzel
how good he was piloting guiding get-
ting thar eli knowing the fine points
in the big swamp reading water short-
cutting and figuring the right of things
now he showed him

  approaching green cane ridge nar-
rows hatchie began looking around
the plantations along backbone were
all his now and the ferry was no more
here the albion cut through having high
land on both sides
  that eveh overflow duck hatchie
asked

  no suh wamber answered neveh
in the highest tide the dark corner eveh
knowed that east bank was moren twen-
ty inches above hih water mist
hatchie yo jes couldnt git on that
hill fo the deer razorbacks cattle-all
of them refugitives suh

   well build a toll-gte there hatchie
 said cabin storehouse and gambrel
 pole how about house water 

   thehs a bubble-spi ing in the gap
   near nough to pipe it

    bout three hundred yards-

   well put in a gasoline turbine and
line hatchie said addingwe come
purty near owning the dark corner now
duck were taking possession but we
need income to hold it were going to
buy fish fur shells everything those
swamp angels take off the dark corner
money has got to come from somewhere
the stillhouse income kept us going
duck wamber stood tense wetzel
was talking to him like his father now
hints had come to duck inquiries how
wetzel was keeping going all that prop-
erty took tax money iawing was expen-
sive the income out of the river night

had gone with the burning of the estab-
lishment grandpap had complained of
expenses and he had made a lawyer out
of wetzel to save attorney fees

  thehs all that surplus gallonage
duck wamber remarked

  whats that duck-surplus gallon-
age wetzel asked quickly what do
you mean

  grandpap dolomen hatchie had never
told wetzel that nobody but duck
wamber knew what lay on the bottom of
the skips in the white sand sure it
looked like the old man had left duck to
help his boy

  why grandpap always kept the stills
runnin full blast duck answered as if
it was a commonplace what he didnt
ship he run aout into the skips an sunk
the day wing dobussy deserted he was
sinking barrels from the jackboat

  he did wetzel asked queerly is
there much of it duck 

  much of hit duck grinned why
grandpap used to say all his profit went
into buyin barrels kaigs jugs offn riveh
junkers an fillin em with surplusage
suh evy yeah hed sink barrels some-
times one er two a week sometimes a
whole weeks run he claimed that was
his savings

  he neveh told me good god duck
-those runaways  come back an git
it wetzel exclaimed why there must
be hundreds of barrels

  yas suh-moren that 

  well look into that wetzel ex-
claimed joyful with relief from the strain
that had grown greater and greater as he
had consolidated his vast land-holdings
so little of which was anything but worry
and expense

despite the sun a chill autumnal
tang was in the air at the forks of
the albion prat adkin the basket-maker
was sitting on the bank weaving willow
osiers-with a driftwood fire to help the
sun warm him

slow down duck hatchie ordered
make sure which way dobussy went
howdy prat  duck hailed
howdy gemen come set an
warm adkin invited wifell bring a
cup o coffee i reckon

  land in hatchie said and they
landed climbing the steep bank ten or
twelve feet to the tent outfit level
hatchie gazed at the five dozen or so
baskets measures and carriers made
from long willow switches which had
grown on the river bars-his bars
  i been working adkin grinned
you call this work hatchie jeered
and adkin cringed beneath that con-
tempt work an hour a day sit around
run around all the rest of the time
hyars coffee mist hatchie-duck 
a tall thin woman flat-bosomed
scrawny-necked her long sallow face im-
passive her eyes sparkling clear and
beautiful blue brought a steaming smoky
aluminum coffee-pot and cups on a bat-
tered pewter tray the drink was black
and good strong enough to take off the
chill she knew how to brew it right

tvheres wing dobussy stay at
  w wamber asked

  why-um-m i jes dont know ad-
kin shook his head in the dark cor-
ner i expaict i neveh did git that fur
back bar willers grow longer through
heah an in the bayous above-

  a difference in the osiers hatchie
asked quickly

  oh yes indeed suh  adkin assured
him these run four-five foot some
bars theys sprouts an hard-barks inside
of two foot-stunteds bigges difrence
ifn theys limber er crackle too suh
then you do have to know some-
thing  hatchie commented with a left-
sided smile and the faintest of shrugs

  having warmed for a moment by the
fire and partaken of the hospitality of the
shack the visitors reentered their fancy
pirogue and took their departure not
even looking back at the tent-man and
his wife who with expressionless features
watched them go who did duck wam-
ber think he was anyhow  the two were
standing there when hatchie and duck
glanced back from the bend up the east
fork feeling gratified to have attracted
such hurt and respectful attention

  above adkins camp the river was
much narrower the banks lower and clos-
er the timber more of a snarl here the
dark corner began tangles of brush cut-
over soft ground water in spreading
basins winding bayous and creeks nat-
ural ditches drained by the forks of the
albion they felt the difference duck
told wetzel when they passed the place
where lotus stalcums father had been
found in a trace that followed a mast-
ridge toward the southeast just above
two men had been found dead hit in the
back by showering bullets-strangers in
a cunner

  govement wamber said his voice
crackling they heard tell a shine still
was up yeah

  the two laughed softly nevertheless
they swung their heads in ceaseless
watchfulness and nervous attention to
those brushy islands and shadowed banks
-ominous even to them

  dont reckon yo blieve in ghosties
er hants mist wetzel  duck asked

  ghosts  hatchie looked back at the
big-bodied little-headed man a smile be-
ginning on his whippy lips but becoming
mirthless beneath a frown and retreating
eyes i- suppose you do duck

  i do duck declared grandpap
had his idees too one time we seen-
well sunthin

  you would wetzel said caint
you get that motor going faster  whatd
you see duck some dark night yo
thought you saw something

  no suh-not at night duck shook
his head a day like thisn hit was
october too sunshiny gobblers callin
bluejays laughin yo know the hell-
diver broad thehs a boat plain as day
feller polin hit with a long double-ender
paddle oveh deep water crossin ahead of
us water slick-i swear to god i seen
the ripples an wake of his cunner one
of them trapper outfits-tent hardware
grub-boxes down to two inches of he
gunales loaded that deep

  i seeri his reflection on the water
sod grandpap a strangeh he was
cornin outn the purple shadder of the
mornin sunshine an hit flashed on his
rifle-stock an barrel he kept a-goin-
kept a-goin an then he thinned out
not all at once but peterin away till we
couldnt see a thing the worst of hit
was the ripples of that cunner kept split-
tin curlin cuttin an we couldnt see
a thing but hit 

hallucination wetzel chuckled un-
easily mass hallucination-i bet you
and grandpap wen scairt to death  
yore damned well right we were
duck assented -hark shootin

through the heavy stillness they
both had heard a ponk and then
two ponks followed in a moment by a
fourth jarring the quiet that was
game-shooting they figured by the
sounds

  thats a rifle duck hatchie sug-
gested inquiringly

  yas suh a long ways off-fast pow-
der-nitro duck analyzed it aloud
 taint a shotgun  scatterguns open up
kinda roll taint a - neither this
crackles-the s got more of a bump
a - duck
  a goose-rifle id say yassuh wam-
ber nodded eagerly dobussys got a
-s they say

  that so i better hug into the points
now-keep watch i 

  they watched ahead coming into view
slowly to study the river ahead the
turns were sharp the bends short and
then duck said

  gravel shoals is ahead-bigges deer
runway through yeah that shootin
sounded like woundin a deer an follerin
up

  lets land then hatchie spoke
quickly well go up the baffk and look
things over

  i reckon so duck assented grin-
ning steering toward the bank where
they landed in the bend just around the
turn below gravel shoals crossing the
varnished pirogue was made fast and
wetzel and wamber crept up into the
timber cut through to look ahead the
water spread wide over rippling spar-
kling rifts a few rods long around the
turn on the top of the bank hatchie saw
a man at work on the pale carcass of a
buck deer

the star-gauge bore suddenly dropped
there were three puffs of smoke three
sledge-hammer blows driving against
the victims waist

  yo rifle duck whispered

  not for this  hatchie answered
patting his revolver scabbard adding
bring yo carbine but keep back i
yassuh duck breathed his face
widening in a yellow-fanged grin of ap-
preciation ill be right theh suh
the dense forest grew to the river-
banlc but among the trunks the ground
was flat bare and compact along the
edge a rod or two within the timber stand
was a path or runway where wild life
skirted the deep water on the way to the
shallow crossing three hundred yards or
so upstream this path the soft soles of
hatchies striding feet followed in sound-
less speed presently he paused behind a
big gum trunk looked ahead and nodded
with satisfaction

  duck could see ahead too where the
skiff of wing dobussy with its bright out-
board at the stern stood out in the after-
noon sunlight and at the top of the low
r

vultures flew away
squawking loudly in
alarm and disgust

bank stooped the hunter who had killed
a fine long-legged swamp buck and was
busily dressing it out where it had fallen

  just as hatchie with duck ten yards
behind stepped from behind a great hol-
low oak tree twenty feet away wing
dobussy sheathed his hunting-blade and
stepped down to the waters edge to wash
his hands when he had shaken the wa-
ter from them and from his clean fore-
arms he sprang back up the bank and
stopped short face to face with wetzel
hatchie-and duck wamber who was
all clear carbine ready just beyond

  no need of wetzel hatchie hurrying in
that wayback desolation duck wamber
squinted and grimaced with satisfaction
now understanding the why of grand-
paps boy being slow careful and patient
in every move taking his own time

  a thin smile of grim complacency
stretched the bright red line of hatchies
lips as he filled his eyes with the specta-
cle of that surprised wild-crafter caught
helpless and hapless his gaze fixed for a
moment on the blued-barrel plated-cylin-
der ornate revolver gripped in a long
dark-skinned hand with the deliberately
conscious calm of a duelists merciless in-
tention

  not a quiver shook that tapered six-
inch barrel as with unhurrying delay it
pointed up leg body and centered on the
victims brow with every advantage be-
hind its aim when dobussys eyes nar-
rowed steady and serene gazing with
bold untroubled courage into the slotted
pits of hatchies eyes hatchie glanced
away-unable to face such unflinching
expectancy

  his own hesitation as well as this ac-
ceptance without plea or fear stirred
fury in hatchie because it robbed him
of unstinted vengeance this poor white
trash had preempted a gentlemans pre-



rogative of knowing how to die then
let him die and know it-know what had
hit him suffer the full inescapable pangs

the star-gauge bore suddenly dropped
aimed with skill and hatred at dobussys
waist there were three puffs of quickly
dissolving smoke three sledgehammer
blows driving against the victims waist
his eyes bulging ov t at each shot

hatchie and duck stood gazing into
the face of the falling man to see
the assembling agony begin hatchie
casually emptied the spent cylinders and
flipped the shells reloaded his revolver
full sheathed it in he scabbard and drew
a package of cigarettes nonchalantly from
his pocket handing it to duck who took
one as his eyes sparkled green in sur-
prised admiration

  they lighted at hatchies gold lighter
studded with its precious stones which
flashed in the bright sunshine hatchies
every move was studied deliberate pos-
ing showing off with the swagger and
pride of arrogance duck stared at him
admiring in open-mouthed excitement

 if in his time duck wamber had
doubted whether wetzel hatchie was able
to hold a candle to his sire grandpap
dolomen hatchie now that questioning
was forever gone in fact if a man
got right down to it wetzel did things
up a mite more brown handsome and
technical than old dolomen

  ducks eyes squinted and popped by
turns his ears wriggled  his breath came
deep he could hardly smoke he was so
excited  but when wetzel turned his back
on the fallen dobussy duck joined him
and they strolled with chins up back
down the river in and out among the
thick tree trunks duck had to look
back at the last step-he just had to
gratify his curiosity sitting on his heels
arms braced the victim was leaning
down arms bending kind of giving way
sometimes a man lives two or three days
when hes taken a bullet in his stomach
wetzel never turned an inch but blew a
ring of smoke meditatively into the still
brake air and stuck ms head into it in-
terested in another trifle-thats how de-
liberate and nervy he was

out of sight of their mortal diversion
wetzel looked thoughtfully over the
green rippling shoal and smiled as a
buzzard came swooping down out of the
milky blue sky casting a purple shadow
on the water a bolder bird than the
others sweeping to sail to the bank to
feast at the place where the deer-hunter
had dragged his game after dressing it

  wetzel hatchie had plenty of heavy
matters to think abcut he had been
amusing himself finding vengeance as
they swung into the river channel he
turned to duck with a decisive gesture

  listen duck you always toted
around with old pap   hatchies gaze
was cold and hard he always had cash
money-he hid out some he told me so
hissef he must have had plenty laid
by out around handy where is it 

  lawse-he want neveh no hand to
tell anybody such private confidentials 
wamber shook his head violently

  dont talk to me-you had your sus-
picions   hatchie spoke with angry ve-
hemence dont tell me-

  ifn he wouldnt tell yo-his own flesh
an blood-hed neveh in gawds worl tell
a hired ovehsepr duck protested stiff
with alarm and doubt

  wetzel hatchies face darkened no
one knew how hard he was being pressed
how close he had come to the ragged edge
of being penniless-bent down by land-
poverty glaring at wamber he wanted
to curse him for not knowing what the
old man would of course never let any-
one know but himself the accounts
which hatchie had pored over were never
exact always there were incomes and
outgoes-money shoved into land and ex-
penses of keeping up the outlawed dis-
tillery the nearest hatchie could fig-
ure scores of thousands of dollars had
been turned into gold and cached in a
hoard or hoards no old dolomen would
never let duck wamber know about that
the scattering bank and the mendova
trust company had changed paper from
liquor shipments into gold-and that was
gone

  well ive got to have money-five
thousand hatchie impatiently indicat-
ed the dark corner wherem i going
to get it  hows anybody get money out
of this damned swamp anyhow ive
got to have cash money-

    why course duck said unhappily
  granpap always said them spare barls
  at the stillhouse was worth a fortune
  my lan mist wetzel he sunk barls in
  the lilies-i don know how many-we
  neveh did keep track

    couldnt we fish up some of it-mar-
  ket it

    oh yes suttinly i bet you could

  johns-all kinds of containers i neveh
  saw sech a feller fo clecting up anything

  why the stuffs selling around a dollar

  thousand dollars thats money 

    yas suh-grandpap said ifn evey-
  thing else run dry on im thehd be the
  sunk cache suh

    well well go get it out-well do

  wetzel sighed suddenly relieved you

  tact the runners-customers-i knowed

  ness want honorable jes his notion-

  orable-plenty money 

    well i wish to god i knew where t

  grimaced well all right-well sell

chapter x

bullets stop short

  wing dobussy had left his - car-
  bine in the stern of his skiff when
  he shot the deer he had even slipped off
  his  automatic scabbard to rest it on
  the thwart because it was awkward when
  he sat on the stern seat

his big game-skinning knife was
sheathed when he stopped short at the
top of the low bank upon finding himself
face to face with wetzel hatchie his re-

the blue book magazine

volver already drawn and duck wamber
backing the play with his - carbine
ready for business

when with numbing force the de-
ferred agony of the impact of the
slugs swelled along every nerve through
every vein and artery into all the extremi-
ties of dobussys being it was as if the
weapon made no sound at the muzzle but
crashed from within against his ears
below his waist nothing seemed to be left
and he sank to his knees the sky turned
black filled with crystalline darts of
sparkling colors

  dobussy knew that he sank to his
knees and lurched forward on the ground
he felt the throb of the departing foot-
steps of the two men the killer and his
handy-man presently down around the
point dobussy heard an outboard pop-
ping and bustling away as the motor
speeded up the explosions growing more
and more regular rhythmic going away
farther and farther downstream then
drawing up in a spasm dobussy pitched
over on his side totally unconscious

  in and out of his senses in and out of
awareness of sunshine of black night of
flickering buzzard shadows   how
could a man bear those thrusting lances
of agony

  yet he had to bear them and so he
clenched his teeth against his groans
only to have his own moans awaken him
he heard his own shrieks and stifled
them  so this was dying the
thought was for an instant greater than
the pain he had been left to die slowly
tortured in lingering agony   

  wing dobussy lay wishing in his an-
guish that he could die and have it over
with then his eyes cleared his mind
calmed the thrusting pangs settled in-
to an enormous ache with quick stabs if
he stirred along nerves as taut as fiddle-
strings across his stomach he was in
and out of torture nausea stupor and ut-
ter unconsciousness his senses fading
into black oblivion were presently re-
stored and he remembered every detail
and saw with strange clarity

  how-come im alive he wondered
hearing birds in morning talk and feel-
ing a gracious warmth in the slanting of
early sunshine wetzel hatchie left me
here to die slow and tortured ive no
right to be living

  he wasnt dead yet the incredible idea
that he wasnt going to die seemed plumb
ridiculous a man with three bullets in
his stomach hasnt a chance in the world

without a surgeon he couldnt even die
comfortably then at a thought he
caught his breath so sharply that it shook
every muscle and twanged every nerve
and he heard his own moan like that of
another a possibility had come to his
mind

  of course if the bullets didnt have
penetration-but that just couldnt be
unless- still the revolver was a -cali-
ber with surging doubt hardly hope
and yet resgfnbling it he dragged his
hands clammy with cold sweat to his
shirt and in spite of the cruel torture
he explored in search of the bullet-holes
in the skin across his waist

  why theres something wrong all
wrong  he whispered in dazed disbe-
lief i cant find- why that cant be 

  he felt of his horsehide money-belt
with pockets all thick with the flat and
once-folded currency which represented
all his savings his resources against pe-
riods or seasons when the returns of wil-
derness occupation were inadequate for
his support his supplies his varied needs

  the belt was homemade out of raw-
hide of a winter-killed horse he had
used the thinnest toughest skin and
sewed it into pockets with flaps that
hooked low into eyes near the bottom
over the belt had been a light woolen
union suit and a heavy woolen shirt

in gasping expectancy and curiosity in
spite of the hurt he explored and found
across the front of the belt the holes
where three bullets had been aimed with
malignant and expert accuracy where
they would cause the crudest death pos-
sible-but also just where the result of
wings thrift had served as an armor of
paper money and coins of gold

  one bullet had gone through the inner
layer of horsehide and maybe a half-inch
into the flesh he could feel the point
stuck into him held in its hole through a
wad of treasury certificates-a place now
of excruciating soreness and throbbing
hurt only this apparently accounted
for his blood-soaked shirt another bul-
let had gone in at a slant was held in the
thick double-fold of five-dollar bills and
hadnt even broken the skin

  having made sure he burst into a
laugh that like to have killed him and
the worse it hurt the more he shook for
joy letting go he relaxed and sprawled
on his back chuckling and gasping at
every spasm of relief and unmitigated
physical anguish vultures flew away
squawking loudly in alarm and disgust
swamp angel

  im only bruised he kept whisper-
ing he just punched me-im sore as
a boil-ouch-oh-ah but im living
im not going to die after all it wont
be a ghost comes back to haunt you wet-
zel hatchie no indeedy and duck
wamber waitll i see you now it
wont be whip-cracking youll hear-no
sir youve done declared war i reck-
on now ill finish it 

  when he tried to roll over the darting
hurts at first held him but he must be
up and on his way and so amid darting
thrusts like knife-blades of pain he
dragged himself into a sitting posture

there lay his deer positively he
couldnt leave and waste it his boat
was down the bank out of sight from the
two murderous scoundrels like an aged
man bent doddering and weak wing
worked and edged around glad it wasnt
a bigger venison as he inched and dragged
himself down the bank sliding over the
bow into the craft

  he pulled the slipknot tied to a root
and let the skiff float into the current
down the shoals in the stillwater eddy he
crept and reached aft to the stern prim-
ing the outboard motor he braced him-
self for the excruciating pangs of crank-
ing the flywheel away it went

  then the shaking of the boat by the
throbbing motor hurt him till he gasped
and had to slow it down to soften the
sharp quivering of the hull

  on his way again wing dobussy could
hardly believe it but for the stabbing
soreness perhaps he couldnt have been
sure of his adventure never had he
known how many different muscles he
used in steering grinning with real joy
nevertheless he bore it all the way up
the current and through the shortcut
back into his own hidden harbor

  as he dropped a line over a cleat on
the stern gunale of his shantyboat he
realized that he was near the limit of his
endurance fighting off ms weakness
and agony he managed to creep aboard
an inch at a time getting onto the deck
trembling at the thovght of losing his
balance and falling overboard on his
knees he tried to unlock the door of the
kitchen-galley sick suffering the world
around him blackening out the afterglow
of sunset suddenly he pitched over on
his face unconscious   

  confusion half-lights strange mingling
of sensations marked his return from
oblivion when present ly his eyes opened
he saw daylight he recognized his own

cabin he ached every heart-beat throb-
bing in his toes and fingers fairly shak-
ing his whole body he smelled iodine
and liniment he felt as well as heard
footsteps beyond the cabin partition

  through the doorway appeared the fig-
ure of a woman a girl and then stand-
ing beside him was isbelle strake stoop-
ing to look at him her blue eyes narrow
with watchful concern his eyes turned
to meet her gaze now-he recollected
what he had gone through

  she drew a chair to sit beside his nar-
row bed

  what happened she asked who
shot you wing dobussy

  for a moment he hesitated no man
to talk about his personal affairs he
found it difficult now to speak out but
briefly he told her about the deer

  i know bout hit  she nodded a
nice little buck i hung him on yo gam-
brel hook wing but how come yo
was shot smack in the belt

 duck wamber and wetzel hatchie
cornered me  he answered and then told
her the details of the river-bank when
they sneaked up on him at gravel shoals
crossing she listened with expression-
less features hard eyes as he gave her the
particulars what was said and done

  he reckons yo killed his pap-ruined
the still  she suggested

  i reckon he does he nodded

 course hed be provoked she
shrugged i found yo on the deck i seen
the holes but not much blood neveh
saw such a bruise in my life i didnt
know if yo was alive o daid till yo
groaned well ive some venison broth
thats sure a fine-conditioned deer yo
killed up i betteh feed yo 

  this is sure friendly of you  he
whispered

  we swamp angels caint be anything
but friendly now  she said i betteh
look afteh yo wing same time my
folksll worry so ill go let em know
soons i can jes yo rest easy

  take my skiff and the outboard he
told her

of course he didnt dare eat much but
to stay his stomach he sipped the
venison broth and he had made a lot
of sweet wild-grape juice these at fre-
quent intervals satisfied his hunger

  no smile crossed the countenance of
isbelle strake she hated his sufferings
she dreaded feared the future he heard
her start the motor and drive away in the
day when she was away dobussy lay


yo caint fool yosef
wing she said yoll he
bushwhacked if yo stay
will you go away with me
isbelle he asked smiling

helpless the bruises were sure deep
he could feel them clear to his backbone

  he was flat on his back since lying on
either side was sheer torture yet never
had he felt quite so plumb contented in all
his born days forehanded and minding
his own business wing dobussy had
plenty of time plenty to eat on board
and the fortitude with which to endure
the slow convalescence from his injuries

  isbelle strake returned sooner than he
expected but said nothing about her par-
ents as she set up a cot in the kitchen-
galley to sleep on the bullets interested
her and wing as they studied them to-
gether being soft-nose one had mush-
roomed and bulged stopping in the paper
currency in his belt the revolver rifling
showed plain one slug had crumpled
against the cheek of a double-eagle lady
and isbelle shuddered at seeing that

  despite wings suffering improvement
of the terrible bruise began at once he
disobeyed the girls remonstrances and
injunctions fighting the hurt and ache
with increasing restlessness

  yo caint fool yosef wing she
said urgently that hatchie hasnt any
use fo yo hell neveh forgive him-
sef fo lettin yo git away hell hunt
yo hell sic duck wamber onto yo

nex time hell use a rifle shootin yo
through an through-in the haid like-
ly yo caint stay heah yo got to
leave the dark corner sho as god
yoll be bushwhacked-killed up-if you
stay he an wamber wont rest till
yore daid 

will you go away with me isbell
he asked smiling

  her lips parted her breath came in a
quick gasp and she turned her face away
her cheeks coloring and fading by turns

  i caint leave my folks jes now
wing she shook her head

  course id better go  he spoke quiet-
ly if i got the swamp angels-all
friends of mine-into the mess in the be-
ginning probly its none of my busi-
ness stayin back io help em out of their
grief an troubles

  yo-yod think of that she did not
again suggest that he go away
gradually he recovered

  isbelle would not stay with him nor
would she marry him-yet when he
could move about she returned home

resuming wild-crafting no wolf or
 panther skulked with greater pre-
caution than dobus-sy through the brake
never knowing at what moment bullets
or buckshot would swarm at him from
ambush he neglected no resource of com-
mon sense hunting skill advantage of
dark corner cover and trackless waters
purposely he avoided swamp stream and
trace thoroughfares as long as hatchie
and wamber believed him dead the more
desperate their surprise and excitement
would be when they learned the truth
isbelle strake was bright thataway she
advised him to wait

  when he had quite recovered though
his bruises still showed under the skin
wing cut through the byways of ditch
and bayou to visit the barstow boys over
yonder approaching the homestead
wing made sure from cover that only
barstow boats were at their landing and
that there were no fresh tracks of stran-
gers coming across from old mississip
where passing craft of old-timers landed
on occasion to visit the barstows

smoke curling from the fireplace and
cookstove chimneys indicated the
boys were at home yet to make sure
dobussy hailed from the brush and the
two brothers came out to look around
answering cautiously

  reckon yore alone  dobussy asked
this is wing dobussy

  sho nough wing huck called re-
assuringly aint nobody likely to come
by us this early not unless offn the
riveh-and theyd be friendly come in
an set

  the visitor climbed the fence blocks
of course the careful approach was sig-
nificant and well understood and when
wing was inside his hosts kept watch
through the windows and the little port-
holes with shutters in the back of the
building on both sides of the big brick-
lined stick-and-mud fireplace chimney

  the brothers flaxed around preparing
dinner they were plumb glad to see
dobussy it had been a right smart time
since they met him out around never-
theless they politely refrained from ask-
ing any questions abcut what might be
none of their business they just passed
the time of day in commonplaces

  i had trouble wing volunteered at
last i met two fellows in back id
just killed a deer and i was beefing it
i didnt even have a scabbard gun and
not suspecting anything i didnt get to
throw my belt-knife anyhow they had
me covered a - carbine and a short
-gun one shot me three times with
his revolver only luck im alive
revolver s aint got so much pene-
tration buck said

  yes-probably short center-fires i
had on a heavy belt that stopped them
dobussy hesitated i dont want to get
yo boys mixed up in anything thats
all there is to it i aint showing mysef
anywhere except just to you

  yo aint scoutin from the law  clem
declared why yo got a case agin

them fellers they shot yo unarmed
hepless mindin yo own business why
wing yo dont have to run out not on
that account go right to scatterin cot
swear out warrants nobody has a right
to shoot a man down thataway-not
when they got the drop on him
these men make the law  dobussy
shook his head choosing his words
they make court law they make poli-
tics law and they choose the gun law
id never have a chancet at court or poli-
tics law but by god boys i fear no
man ill take my chance in fair play
with a -caliber meat pistol against any
cowardly scoundrel whod shoot a man
down an leave him to die slow thinking
he had three bullets in his stomach 
us barstows know how that is huck
said hoarsely we found ouh pap daid
shot down without a chancet in gawds
world bushwhacked we had ouh sus-
picions hit was a - bullet at the
same time not being able to prove hit
we waited till we could know for certain
we neveh cut ouh timber one feller
tried to git hit for nothin practically
pap barstow wouldnt sell they was
talk of lawin but i told old grandpap
hatchie to his face hit was sho lots of
bresh along the albion forks an bayous
he neveh said a word-jes blinked-an
he neveh done nothin duck wamber
twisted his neck evy time they met us
watchful we always expected they were
jes bein patient course thats pri-
vate wing we dont talk when were
goin where were goin or how were
goin like a panther we neveh go the
same way twicet in succession if were
friendly were damned good loyal neigh-
bors that means yo wing dobussy
thehs been talk around i reckon yoll
want somebody to bring in supplies some-
times  an thehs always a spare bunk
heah gin yo need to come out the bresh
to rest we know how tis scoutin out
account of bad friends-we neveh fussed
the law though

  im legal mysef dobussy shook
his head i wouldnt ask yo to go risky
on my account-

  risk nothin  clem exclaimed ifn
we like a feller well go right plumb to
hell with him this is ouh fight too  

they ate for an hour or so at squirrel
dumplings talking back and forth
planning and going over details this
was to be real campaigning mortal ene-
mies must be met whether to kill or
get to cover must be decided
the blue book magazine

  of course they were really peaceable
all they wanted was just to be left alone
to mind their own business they hated
the desperate need but men just didnt
have to stand for some things not from
anybody they had to feel they liked to
believe they were the equal of any pos-
sible occasion that might arise

  wing told his friends all there was to
his difficulty he told how he had been
taken at rifle-muzzle and held with shot-
gun labor in old grandpap dolomen
hatchies moonshine stillhouse stockade
for months he showed the whip-marks
left by ducks lash laid on with a whip
no matter how faithfully he did his work

  he described how patient he had been
told of his increasing resentment till a
mystery shot toppled down his guard and
enabled him to escape in the thunder-
storm downpour he had risked his life
to swim away in the screen of rain

  theh was no chancet of getting any-
thing done by sheriff judge or the law
about those por devils toiling in the
swamp with duck wambers whup-lash
raising red an blue welts on their backs
dobussy spoke harshly nobodyd be-
lieve those things you know that as
well or bettern i do probly

  yes we know thehs talk around
the brothers agreed

  now old grandpaps daid shot down
huck grinned without mirth those
works are all burned and wracked
junked looks like sun thin sure must
of happened even ifn law didnt speak
up

  yas suh dobussy said quietly
something plenty happened youre
damned well right it did 

  the brothers exchanged glances and
then gazed at wing dobussy who sat
staring at his plate they did not dis-
turb his grim revery till with a little
start he shook himself out of his trance

  its a rough old world boys he
sighed sagging a little seems like a
man isnt ever big enough for his job 
the barstows nodded they knew
how that was

chapter xi

wheres that moonshine

wetzel hatchie carried himself as
if everything was going according
to his ideas indeed when he first took
hold of his fathers affairs the estate
seemed to be in splendid condition tens
of thousands of acres were a solid basis

for any mans fortune in the banks
two in mendova and in the scattering
court bank were thousands of dollars
expense money apparently all wetzel
had to do was hold his own and keep on
absorbing the lands to which his father
had laid clandestine or open claims

the old families on the backbone
ridge included the holstons and the
clinches a feud had begun between
them before the civil war and it had
waxed and waned all down through the
years difficulties coming every once in
a while now both families were about
wiped out the women had scattered
and children had grown up in ignorance
mostly leaving home to go west into the
great plains texas and the cow-country

  county clerk quailen claiming to be
acting on behalf oii the people suddenly
came down on the clinch plantation in
order to collect taxes that had been more
or less delinquent for twenty or thirty
years the families which still remained
living out around in the houses even in
the quarter cabins had expected trouble
wetzel hatchie circled around and took
up quitclaims paying fifty dollars here
twenty-five dollars there a hundred dol-
lars in another place

  tom-ed clinch though refused to sell
settle or placate a tall mouthy and
high-spirited man what he lacked in edu-
cation he made up in shrewdness time
had been when he was quality but now
only the pride remained his wife was
pretty but dark complexioned and two
men were dead because they had ques-
tioned whether she was white

  when wetzel hatchie came smiling
and explaining showing by this and that
paper that the clinches had about
reached the end of their rope tom-ed
took it up plain and strong

  ill be teetotally damned if land-
thieves speculators and second-genera-
tion scouter-moonshiners can run me off
my property that we clinchesve had a
hundred and fifty yeahs tom-ed said

  wetzel hatchie never raised his voice
talking he used only quiet words which
he took from law-books and polite vo-
cabularies he stowed his dignity and
magnanimity tom-ed talked aloud and
abusive right there in scattering court
square listeners expecting every minute
to see wetzel hatchie fly off the handle
and finish what clinch started but hat-
chie slid from under and let it be known
that tom-ed was unreliable ignorant
and whisky-foolish
swamp angel

  however hatchie went into court the
next county term two weeks later he
presented his claims and put down his
documents he put on witnesses and
brought in bob ranger of mendova as
counsel ranger knew lands laws and
human nature as exemplified by an
owned back-county judge and a hand-
picked jury

 tom-ed clinch and his relations
couldnt see how anyone could actually
have any real claim against their proper-
ty theyd lived on it all their lives as
had generations of ancestors before them
just the right of adverse possession they
understood would protect them they
had a whipper-snapper fellow budden
seek representing them seek would take
razor-back hog pork eggs a side of beef
five-gallon cans of wilcl honey and so on
for his fees splitting any money that
might be in sight seek was pretty good
at law but his politics were away off
and as for the rest he was honest faith-
ful and managed to get along somehow
hatchie hired him to search particularly
difficult titles once in a while-but his
reports always told the truth instead of
being according to the interests of his
clients

  the jury and the court held with
county clerk quailen and wetzel hat-
chies claims dolomen hatchie had
acquired quitclaims papers some of the
clinches never heard of the hatchie
estate owned more than half the outstand-
ing titles according to the findings then
the taxes hadnt been piaid-according to
the books the clinches couldnt find
receipts they claimed theyd received
they lost the whole plantation

  tom-ed and his relations were stunned
the other members or the family took
the verdict honorably peaceably they
knew it wasnt any use trying to hang
on they couldnt appeal because they
couldnt raise money for the lawyers ex-
penses going before the land court away
off yonder somewhere ifthe clinch
case was carried clear up it might land
in the legislature so what was the use

but tom-ed instead of being merely
sick got mad ke was cold sober
when the case was tried after the jury
came in he went out into the brush and
bought a flat quart this was genuine
- honey and wild-grape distillings
and three dinks of it confirmed tom-eds
sober ideas if a mart thinks the same
drunk as he does sober or more so he
is just plumb sure right

  wetzel hatchie left the court square
with attorney ranger on the way home
where hatchie was putting on a dinner
for the judge the foreman of the jury
several professional and commercial men
with mr ranger as the guest of honor

  tom-ed clinch met the two under the
yellowing horse-chestnut trees and his
flushed cheeks his narrowed eyes the
drawing in of his lips all showed he was
sure feeling the verdict

  hold on yo he said fo once in
yo life wetzel hatchie yo got to listen
to a plain clear honest statement of
what yo are an what yo old pap dolo-
men was im tellinyo 

  the last of the clinch family planta-
tion men the last of the family that had
owned land and planted big cotton
talked his voice was like a lawyers
and he knew the hatchies father and son
who they were in the dark corner and
what they did his tone taunting and his
bearing slighting tom-ed let go the
hatred contempt and spite of generations
naming times places and whats

hatchie stood with one ear turned
a little listening to every word he
never stirred his head but every once
in a while his pale eyes would flicker and
dart glances out around he whitened
and he turned ivory pink-and tom-ed
never in gods world had had a man he
insulted and talked down that attentive
before it just seemed as though wet-
zel hatchie was taking it attorney
ranger stood off at one side his face ex-
pressionless people all ground the
square hearing that loud snarling rasp-
ing voice came nearer to listen closer
and see everything they didnt get be-
hind either one of the two men though
apparently hatchie wasnt going to do
anything

  then suddenly he slipped off his waist-
belt a narrow thick piece of muleskin
and whipped out with it he had estab-
lished by this time his forbearance his
patience his peaceableness his minding
his own business the flat of the strap
smacked tom-ed like a twisty snake
curled around the back of his head and
sounded like a pistol on his left cheek
tom-ed jerked his mouth wide open it
stung so then he reached for his hip
pocket and wetzel hatchie had his plea
of self-defence absolutely established in
the eyes of a hundred witnesses-however
reluctantly they would testify consider-
ing tom-eds provocation in the way
the court build-up had developed
t

  wetzel hatchie whipped back his coat
and slapped the butt of a -caliber re-
volver in its snap-socket shoulder scab-
bard he pulled the butt around close to
his right shoulder tightened his grip on
the butt lifted the muzzle and let go
one-two-three the prettiest draw ever
seen in scattering court square fast
graceful and sure the three bullets hit
tom-ed in the left breast a silver dol-
lar actually covered them later all three
went through clinchs heart and stopped
just under his skin at the back lots of
people who had thought wetzel was just
a smooth lawing show-off changed their
minds right then and there

  come to find out tom-ed didnt have
any gun on him hed begun to sweat
across his brow and when he went for
his hip-pocket it was to get a red ban-
danna this was just tom-eds foolish-
ness or thoughtlessness if hed had a
gun it wouldnt have made any differ-
ence as far as wetzel hatchie was con-
cerned hed stood right up to a mouthy
scoundrel and been cool collected and
calculating tom-ed was a dangerous
character hed done meanness in his
day now he got his

  the inquest was put over so as abso-
lutely to conform with the legalities
more than twenty witnesses the finest
most representative tale of witnesses ever
seen in a scattering court case testified
to the reaching for the gun when insults
had been passed tom-eds killings as
far as known were recorded officially

  and then wetzel hatchie himself testi-
fied to his feelings motives actions waiv-



ing the right of immunity and he seemed
shy talked frankly and expressed regrets
that the necessity had driven him to take
the life of a fellow-man i felt i had to
protect mysef he explained he made
a very good impression all things con-
sidered

  the coroners verdict was justifiable
homicide in self-protection without mal-
ice wetzel turned right around and
paid every cent of tom-eds funeral ex-
penses and though according to the land-
verdict he didnt ewe the family a cent
he paid the widow one thousand dollars
for her quitclaim and so the last of the
clinches left scattering county

  another thousand dollars went to at-
torney ranger for using his acumen and
knowledge in the matter of the lands

busy as he was lawing and research-
ing keeping his eyes open for po-
tential disturbers and difficulties wetzel
hatchie was surprised one day to re-
ceive a note from the mendova swamp
bank stating that his account was over-
drawn by three hundred dollars the
check he gave attorney ranger had done
this hatchie hadn t posted up his check-
books lately having so much on his mind
he didnt have more than house-ex-
penses left in the scattering court bank
when he drew to cover the overdraft the
other bank didnt have money enough to
pay the taxes he had underwritten on the
clinch plantation
   looking back through the bank-books
of his father wetzel hatchie checked vip
on the deposits his father had handled
a right smart of money he had taken in
hundreds and thousands of dollars de-
positing cash that meant stillhouse
dividends he had puthe money back
into the land-thousands tens of thou-
sands of acres

   you buy land and you got something
to show for investment old dolomen
hadaid keep plenty cash on hand for
emergencies and bargains and have hit
where yo cn git hit

   wetzel felt as if a coil of rope were
 tightening on him where was the cash
 old dolomen hatchie always kept on
 hand  wetzel searched through the
 mansion that had belonged to judge stal-
 cum knowing there must be a hoard of
 ready cash hidden somewhere the moon-
 shine-still surplus the three banks
 couldnt have accounted for more than a
 tithe of the money old hatchie had taken
 in keeping clear of income taxes and
 knowing what he was about always hav-
 ing plenty of funds ready at hand

  wetzels face drew into hard bony
lines his small mustache and goatee ac-
centuating the full-blooded -ed of his
lips set in his tawny features like old
ivory with a flush of pi ik in his cheeks
his black deep-sunk eyes stared around
him but whatever he looked at proved
to be a mockery and there was no trace
of the lost money except that wetzel
found here and there hints of thousands
tens of thousands of dollars gold
tradedmemoranda said yes they
said at the banks old pap was a great
hand to bring in a few hundreds or thou-
sands of dollars in paper money and ex-
change it for hard money-gold

  pride if nothing else would prevent
wetzel hatchie from letting it be known
that he had already run through the cash
his father carried around his bankers
knew that he was sure low in his bank re-
serves but he had stock in those banks
and the higher-ups were not talkative
wetzel sent a yellow boy for wamber

  wamber came into the library with
swamp-bottom mud on his boots

  well have to take up some of that
liquor in the stillhouse harbor hatchie
declared twelve-fifteen barrels howll
we run it out to market 

  why uh-h-mist hatchie i neveh

mosly used fo towin shells

  well rig the heavy-duty launch for

they were off that late evening they
slept aboard the launch two miles be-
low the strake outfit they were off the
strake eddy soon after sunrise they
hailed and isbelle herself came out on
the stern deck of her parents boat

  mornin miss isbelle hatchie
greeted politely youre losing weight
youre working too hard you need a
rest

  no rest when im working she
shrugged what do you want
hatchies geniality slacked is that
barge for sale he asked

swered

  how much you asking

  im using it-i dont care to sell it
far as that goes

  whats it worth duck hatchie
asked

  duck wamber caint put a price on
any of my things she declared ive
had my experience with him an he
with me too 

  oh you peppered him with no s
didnt you  wetzel laughed and duck
glared remembering how she had run
him through the brake with more than
a hundred pellets of lead sunk in him
but really-set a price wont you
the blue book magazine

  she looked at the georgia pine scow
thirty feet long five wide and thirty
inches deep painted on planed lumber
inside and out

  ill take one hundred and fifty dol-
lars she announced

  why shucks i could build it for
fifty dollars hatchie exclaimed

  well build it then   she shrugged
chuckling starting to leave the deck to
go into the cabinboat

  hatchie checked her with a wait
and looked at duck duck said it would
take a week to get a scow built and
painted and hatchie said well take
it  he turned to duck throw off the
line 

  hold on mist hatehie yo aint
paid for hit yet

  do you mean to say- hatchie was
furious

  old pap dolomen took a thirty-dol-
lar skift offn us once an he neveh would
pay for it  she said that scow stays
tied i got an outboard motor offn old
dolomen-for the skift yo pay cash
or keep yo hands off my propty mist
hatchie 

  do you mean to say you dont trust

  not a minute not two foot goin
but-uh-h-i havent the money with
me  he urged placatingly

  ive hearn yo aint got hit any-
wheres   she jeered yore land por
they say

  i got hit duck unbuckled the flap
of his money-belt and as he counted out
one hundred and fifty dollars wetzels
face darkened

wetzel tossed the roll of currency
on the stern deck isbelle counted
it then she threw the mooring-line to
duck and shoved the scow clear with a
pike-pole the two made fast bow and
stern alongside and headed up into the
short-cut on their way over to the east
fork when they glanced back they saw
her leaning against the cabin with her
elbow on the roof watching

  shes a good-shaped girl duck
wetzel grinned how come you neg-
lected her anyhow

 wamber grimaced angrily wetzel
knew well enough what ailed duck as
regarded isbelle strake they went on
up the east fork and into the stillhouse
branch night had fallen but duck
knew the channel light or dark and they
struck through the narrow clear way be-
tween the spreads of broadwaters and

patches of lily pads and the pale flowers
that glowed in the gloom

  before them when they struck the har-
bor of the skips loomed the collapsed
ruin of the stillhouse that had given old
dolomen hatchie his fortune now it
was a lonely desolate wreck in solitude
most of the old stockade had fallen over

  an owl hooted a swamp wolf called its
curse whispery hisses sounds they could
not identify bothered them as they
stretched tha canvas hood over hoops and
ate a cold snack by the light of an elec-
tric-battery bulb

  well just run a small load for pocket
money wetzel said

  duck nodded saying nothing per-
sonally the stillhouse ruins brought him
terrible memories he never had been
back since he brought out old dolomens
body and then showed wetzel how things
were the ruins di dnt look natural not
for an instant did he let on that he was
bothered-wetzel didnt believe in ghosts
no place in the world had ghostlier feel-
ings than this

they stretched their shock-bags on
the bottom board and went to bed
though not to sleep duck had his uncom-
fortable reflections wetzel had his of a
different nature they had plenty ideas
to figure they were up before dawn
eating a cold snack breakfast and by the
time they had appeased their slack appe-
tite the day was dawning swiftly

  wheres the best liquor sunk wet-
zel asked

  why i don know zactly duck an-
swered first along it was sunk thout
no system just right in the deep water
dost as they could them fool labors
piled hit up four-five barls deep but
granpap made rn scatter hit jes one
barl deep-an in the pads suh

  then all this close in is good hat-
chie said old

  they poled out a few yards and began
to prod the bottom they found sand
that the pike-hooks crunched in the
sound coming up the poles they kept
prodding in seven to ten feet or so of
water they found sand and tangles of
roots and tree-roots over along the bluff
reefs along the deep natural ditch

  why-why vheres them barls
duck exploded after holding his breath
in expectancy that was not realized
why this bottom was jes paved with
barls an kaigs oh-yars one-

  but that was a sunk gum-log by the
looks of it shading their eyes the two


swamp angel

men searched the bottom through the
clear utterly limpid water at first they
found no place where a barrel had been
even then they saw a barrel that had
collapsed they struck broken glass car-
boys they looked at each other and
then looked back at the stillhouse ruins

  they went to see what had happened
to the place they stood on an unburned
timber end the place had been ran-
sacked not a piece of copper was in
sight even the dump-heap of worn-out
copper worms stills e nd special pumps
was devastated

  why-why mist hatchie hits been
junked duck wambers voice rose in
hollow astonishment and pain

  and-and the liquor high-jacked
hatchie cried by god-i dont have
to stand being robbed this way duck
wamber you talk-right i

  ducks red little cabbage of a face yel-
lowed he talked wetzel hadnt had
duck out of his sight more than an hour
or two at any time any more than old
dolomen had ever lost track of him
no duck hadnt personally robbed the
sunken cache hatchie collapsed for a
while shaken and at loss they went
and looked over the bottom of the old
stillhouse harbor and they found five
barrels two kegs several five-gallon glass
carboys

  itll-itll make pocket money wet-
zel spoke weakly

  but mist hatchie i watched barls
dumped into this year water fo years an
years duck protested grandpap al-
ways said thehs a millyum dollars laid by
in yeah 

  damned pirates dirty rat crooks
steal anything they cn lay their hands
on  hatchies voice was shrill and hol-
low like a defeated bulls they robbed
me-they stole my property by god i
wont wait for the law to catch up- with
them ill-

  yo caint go to law mist hatchie
hits illegal  duck gasped

hatchie stiffened blinked started
to speak-swallowed instead
dont i know he suddenly snarled
outraged im a lawyer but these
damned poor white swamp angels-
bleeding me my god duck-ive got
to get that liquor-money why ill lose
my land im strapped-i cant pay

whered he go why in hell didnt he
tell me where tis whered he cache it
he never took me with him--i mem-
ber he said hed neveh tell till he was on
his deathbed-an-an knowed hit
wamber shook his head

  and he got himself killed up hat-
chie gasped

  just when he came into the hatchie
estate everything going so good there he
was up against it

  yo never told me the liquor was
cached here  he snarled at wamber
a million dollars cached-you covered
up on me by god i blieve-

  now now mist hatchie i-i was
too busy ifn id thought- duck
urged in panic pleading the glare of
wetzel hatchie grew dull with helpless
suspicion but nothing could be proved

exhausted they dozed awhile then
headed down the albion in the night
going to mendova to sell what little liquor
they had salvaged they stopped over
the day at scattering court the next
night they tripped down and in the morn-
ing which was dull and foggy they
steered into the rank fox river duck
heading for the confidential landing at
the old brick warehouse long associated
with night-time and foggy weather mis-
sissippi river transporting business

  duck started up the trail to the office
and a man came down to see about buy-
ing the stuff

  hatchie shine eh he said old
barrels um-m market fo old-line
liquors purty well stocked up lots been
coming in lately but ill take hit id
know those old barls an kaigs dolomen
hatchie used-

  he counted the price down to wetzel
wetzel felt a lot better men came down
with a dray to load the liquor and then
suddenly dim figures swarmed into view
in the gray mist

 up you-all of you an order
snapped federal officers

  the buyer and seller and hired help
jumped-all obeyed

youre undev arrest-liquor charges 
an exultant voice exclaimed i reckon

time containers

  hue-e  he yelped now thas sun-

swamp angel comes to its climax in our forthcoming july issue


by

harold
titus

when art ramsay went
whooping across the city
after ten oclock that night
he didnt take chances with
traffic cops just because he was a job-
shop man on a breakdown call not
much he wasnt even a job-shop man
really anyhow he wouldnt be after
eight in the morning when the trust
company was going to check the bank
balance of scolt tool  metal works-
where art had gone from apprentice to
manager-and take the keys and hand
them over to some other dude

  he drove hellety-larrup because the
call had come from hiram winslow
hume purchasing agent at clyde-barst
truck the trust company was let-
ting him out because of humes double-
crossing and this was his chance to tell
it to hume with all the trimmings

  as he smashed speed limits and ran red
lights he rehearsed sort of

  nuts to you hume  he said through
his teeth trying to sound tough when
there wasnt a tough hair in his head i
wouldnt lift a hand for you if you
crawled on your belly  he said but that
didnt sound so good

  go take a dive off the bridge hume
he said trying again i hope your swell
new plant rusts down before any job-shop
in town comes through he said and
that went flat too

  for he wasnt so handy with words
he could handle lathes and shapers and
milling-machines and presses like no-
bodys business-but with words he
wasnt so hot

  but after hed listened to hume a few
minutes and put two and two together to
make six or seven he was glad he hadnt

 known how to pin a mans ears back
 plenty glad because he saw that if he
 held everything this was maybe a chance
 to get an eye for an eye or anyhow a job
 for a job and what could be sweeter

   sweat on humes hard blue jaw had
 first given art the hunch this might be
 something besides another breakdown
 hume sat at his desk wearing his tuxedo
 and the sweat popped out in little beads
 he sat behind his three telephones and
 tried to be as tough and insulting as ever
 and didnt put it over in a corner un-
 derstand  scared stiff see  like a fight-
 er with his guard dropping and his chin
 coming out

    and while art pretended to listen to the
 trouble that had pulled hume away from

a spirited drama of men and
their work by the author of
flame in the forest
they didnt think it could be done but
they were trying their best anyhow

some ritzy shindig his mind werit in high
trying to figure out jus t why the bozo was
that way

  this damned bumjoer press has given
us trouble from the startvhume said
been a case of building up a bank and
then tearing the whole press down ever
since we got into production he said
and his nails showed white as he twisted
one of the phone cords

  had to get going again and left the
stripper off temporarily he said so
these fatheads on the bobtail shift to-
night didnt notice that a formed bumper
stuck to the punch arid rode it up the
whistle blew they went to lunch and
thirty minutes later shipped in another
blank he said and his hand trembled

away she goes-die gears shaft and
all

  i see said art commencing to get a
hazy idea

  the dies gone said hume its
beyond any repair he said like any-
body hard up against it will repeat the
same thing over and over itll take any-
how two weeks to get another and well
want our bumpers formed outside

  i get it said art trying to keep his
face dead-pan because humes eyes were
hiding something holding back some-
thing that was evidently a lot more im-
portant than a smashed die-and they
were having a time of it

  well have to get going hume said
theres no time to lose
  art shot a look at the blueprint on
humes desk-of a big heavy channel-
type bumper with a radius on the ends

  how much time he said trying not
to show how excited he was by what hed
commenced to guess

  hume didnt-move but when he an-
swered it was as if he strained forward

  deliveriesll have to start no later
than eight he said

  art stopped the words at his teeth
eight oclock  hed almost yelled the
way a man will when asked to do the im-
possible but he didnt he just cleared
his throat instead

  well thats a job of work he man-
aged to say easy-like and he pulled the
blueprint around as if he was still run-
ning a job-shop and ready to get going

  and hume kept giving him more to
sift and add he talked a streak but after
a minute or two art wasnt fooled after
just a minute or two art got down
through that mess of words and under-
stood what was eating on hume he
talked about the job he wanted art to
do but his mind was right on his own
job and no place else everything he
said about what had to be done for clyde
tied in with what had to be done for him

  art breathed easier when that came
clear clyde-barst truck just into pro-
duction didnt have a bank of bumpers
big enough to wad a gun oh maybe
they could start another shift maybe
run a few hours but the end was in
sight and unless they got supplied theyd
be up a deep creek without a paddle
you dont store big trucks and you dont
deliver incomplete not in these days

when art got that clear the rest un-
raveled easy enough these big
plants get heavy-footed maybe clyde-
barst had men in maintenance and tool
engineering who could make a fair stab
at cutting this mustard just a fair stab
because they get used to gearing in with
other men and departments but in a
big outfit theyd never have a chance
too much paper work too many studies
and estimates and okays and carbon cop-
ies and requisitions in the way

  so everybody all down the line had an
out see until they came to hume the
purchasing agent top-side had hung the
trouble right around humes neck and
gone home to bed and hume must have
bumpers in sight by morning-or else
thats what art added up

  his mouth got a little dry for weeks
hed been carrying a hunk of ice under his

heart because his job was slipping his
job had slipped because of humes dirty
billiards now it was his turn

  mild little guy art light-haired
blue-eyed voice low and gentle but
now inside he went native he had
hume in his hands he wanted to hold
him there wanted to squeeze and make
him suffer

lot of job-shops in the city like in any
a other industrial town see  maybe a
dozen that specialized among other
things in pressed-m etal operations may-
be a half-maybe only a third-of these
could make a fair to good try at turn-
ing around on a baby like this in time
but of them all scolt tool  metal was
the one best bet

  that was why hume had had the brass
to call art after pouring it into him for
months desperate see and if art
was going to get in a haymaker hed
have to play his cards right he couldnt
let hume suspect that by the time clyde
had to have those bumpers hed be walk-
ing out of the scolt shop for the last rime
that he was as gocd as washed up right
now if hume guessed that hed be
trying some other place and whoever he
turned to might scratch through ahd
save his hide for him

  but if art took all the time there was
if he stalled and kept hume in his hands
-why then he could start looking up an-
other job for himself with the satisfaction
of knowing that the skids were nicely
greased for mr hume   

  so its a sweet piece of business for
some goldberger hume said if youve
got what it takes

  that was more like the jeering scorn-
ful hume hed got hold of himself
again art leaned closer to the blueprint
to hide his flush being called a gold-
berger by hume sung him he didnt
want to show that because of the way
one thing leads to another   

  now goldbergers a good word in its
place it means in the job-shops a way
of doing things thats never been tried
before you have something to do and
no tools or dies to do it with you have
maybe just a sample of the piece to be
turned out and your experience and imag-
ination  you start to town from there

  you rig up a contraption that may look
like these cartoons of self-baiting mouse-
traps and what-not that rube goldberg
used to draw youll use blocks of cold
rolled and chunks of wood and railroad
iron and shimming material and bold
realizes that but the little guys in al-
ley shops make their living pulling chest-
nuts out of the fire for the ones who get
pieces written about them

  still to hear hume youd think when
he gave a job-shop work he was tossing
a dime to a panhandler that was his
way of getting the low figure to make
folks feel like scum or dirt thats why
he had three telephones to make sales-
men think he was mussolini or some-
thing thats why so many guys hated
sight of him

  he hadnt bothered art at first be-
cause hed never bothered old man scolt
scolt was an old-line mechanic sure of
himself proud of his work making a
religion of resourcefulness and hed
brought art up that way to

  most boys want the showy jobs these
days hed told art in the beginning
they like limelight hd said and the
limelight is on mass production but i
dont know hed said and twisted his
head in that doubtful way i dont know
what well come to if we narrow too
many of our folks dowr too far

  im afraid he said that we may get
too dependent on blueprints for living
as well as making a livin g hed said and
looked far off through the grimy shop
window if were goinj to stay strong

hed said we need a supply of boys who
dont have to have everything-jobs as
well as lives-laid out for them maybe
that wont make sense son hed said
and again maybe youll think it does
when youre older

maybe art never got all the angles to
old man scolts religion but by the
time scolt was laid up and art whod got
to be foreman went in as manager he was
thinking and acting pretty much on that
pattern

  art had been getting along since scolt
died no praise from the trust com-
pany understand but trust companies
seem to be that way if they just dont
squawk everythings jake each month
he took the report down to connolly one
of the vice presidents and connolly
looked it over and didnt kick and gave
art what he asked for

  but one day art called clyde-barst
truck to ask about some specifications
that had come over and humes secre-
tary told art to hang on because hume
was talking on another line he was
talking into another of those three tele-
phones he was talking to kline an-
other job-shop man and art could hear
every word

  hume was peeling klines hide

 them together with g-clamps until they
 look like a disaster to a junk-pile and
 you get done what has to be done to save
 the goat of somebody whos used to de-
 pending on a lot of high-sounding de-
 partments and fancy help

  why some big plant is getting saved
by a goldberger almost every day you
never hear about that nobody much

while lie roughed the lay-
out he was thinking hciw
hume would sweat blood
wlieu he found out

 illustrated by
 grattan condon
the old sandpaper going on see
hume pouring it into art just because
art had heard him telling somebody else
he was good next he turned back an
experimental truck-frame and rejected
other jobs and then wouldnt even see
art

  it turned black to red connolly com-
menced to fuss things went even worse
for the shop you cant pick off new
business every day when things are tough
skip the agony though that afternoon
connolly had planned to meet art for the
last time but hed been delayed and
phoned art to meet him first thing in the
morning and art had said he would
trying to keep the heartbreak out of his
voice and that was that

  he lived over all this in just a second
or two after hume made his crack about
goldbergers    goldberger was he
in that tone of voice was he well hed
never tried to goldberg a brass hat out of

 his job before-but he certainly could
 give it a try

   nobody except the trust company and
 his wife knew he was out why he
 hadnt even told his wife until that night
 -because even if he was past thirty a
 lump got in his throat when he tried to

   he commenced to feel good like may-
 be an indian did when he figured out a
 new scheme of torture

   okay he said trying to keep shakes
 out of his voice ill need a drawing-
 board first

   right down the hall hume said
 and grinned he grinned like a kid whos
 just over a scare well get going  he
 said and art had the hunch he hadnt
 been quite sure of himself until then
 and ill go along and see how you get
 started he saic-and that was like a
 kick in the stomach for art

  when i want something done he
said i go to scolt tool  metal they
dont give excuses he said they deliver
the goods

  he said a lot more and none of it
meant anything to art except that hume
was trying to make kline eat out of his
hand just his line see but when
hume finally picked up the other phone
and said hello and art said this is
ramsay it was as if somebody had
opened a door he felt a cold draft i
mean

  he got his question answered and
didnt think about that draft again un-
til he tried to deliver the work hed been
asking about it was a fixture job and it
represented a lot of material and labor
but hume wouldnt accept

  whats wrong  art asked him plen-
ty worried

  wrong yelled hume theres so
much wrong theres no place to start
talking he yelled you get your truck
over here and cart this junk back to your
alley or wherever it is you do your gold-
berging and dont try to deliver until its
right get me 

  well art got the stuff back and he
and maclver his foreman went over it
and found everything up to the line but
hume wouldnt listen to that and the
upshot was that he put a lot of mileage on
his truck lugging those fixtures back and
forth and had the shop spend days work-
ing over them and when hume finally
accepted just as theyd been in the first
place arts profits had run into a loss
how long we got on tills one
mac asked as he wadded up a
chew ol snuff eight oclock
art said and hans growled
have a heart boss

  he had to patch up his goldberging
act in a hurry if hume was going to
hang around it couldnt be only a stall
hed have to make a start on the job
well he had the shop keys didnt he
hed never put on a show before but may-
be he could hed done a lot of things
that nobody had ever tried hed start
off as if he was going through with it

  first though ill have to phone he
said and fished out his book of telephone
numbers any job-shop man carries with
him because you never can tell when
somebodys going to yell for help

  he got a steel salesman out of bed
ordering a bill of material with his eyes
on the blueprint just as if he meant it

  ill be at your place in thirty min-
utes he said have your torch-cut-

ter there and be there yourself he said
and hung up and dialed maclvers num-
ber

  mac little break-down job for clyde
he said ill leave the blueprint at the
shop and you can get at the templets
im having dummy dies torched out at
lasalle steel youll need two shaper
men to start and better have ray bring
the pick-up to lasalle in an hour

  he talked fast he didnt snap but
he talked fast and the way he talked made
hume relax a little more man jumping
into a job

  art got up dragging the blueprint with
him

  wheres that drawing-board he
said his heart going good and hard be-
cause hed never tried anything like this
the blue book magazine

before and you better get blanks or-
dered over to the shop while i make this
lay-out he-said and got a lot of satis-
faction at seeing the hope come up and
up in humes eyes

  but it was something else when he got
at the drawing-board i mean there sat
something hed have liked to try and no
mistake walloping old bumper-eighth-
inch steel with an inch flange on each
edge and that radius on each end clyde
had formed it all in one operation of
course shot the blank into the press
slapped the switch-buttons and before
the operator could spit you had a bump-
er   after three weeks of making and
setting the die understand

  a job-shop though wouldnt have any
three weeks it would have less than
eight hours it would have to turn one
flange at a time in a power break then it
would take that channel section and form
first one end radius and then the other on
a die that was now only a block of steel
in some dark warehouse

  one of those challenges art ate up if
you get me a job hed have liked to
wrestle with but he wasnt going to try
it he was just going to make a bluff at
starting and quit cold the minute hume
left and never know whether he could
have delivered the goods or not

  hell with it  he whispered and while
he roughed the lay-out he was think-
ing how hume would burn up the tele-
phones and sweat blood when he found
out one of hispet worms had turned
yes and how hume would look when top-
side wanted to know how come he hadnt
gotten bumpers

  hume was walking up and down be-
hind him by then he had his overcoat
and hat on and kept snapping his lumbs
he kept it up until art was finished and
they went out to arts car together

they didnt talk going across town
hume smoked cigarettes too fast
and arts mind was full of dies he
kept thinking just how hed plan that die
if the job were for somebody else-if
he intended to try to get away with it
any monkey can form a flat piece of
steel understand but putting an eight-
inch radius in that channel section and
not having it wrinkle was something else
again he thought back to a dozen other
jobs hed gotten away with and picked
out his mistakes and those hed almost
made-and by the time he pulled up at
the shop he was seeing that dummy die in
detail in his minds eye

    want to wait here he asked hume
  mac hasnt made it but hell be along
  pretty soon

    no ill go to lasalle with you
  hume said

    art unlocked the office door all
  right he growled youll see some-
  thing my lad goldbergers is it  okay
  then 

  jensen the steel salesman was wait-
  ing in his office when they got there
  hi art he ssid and gave hume a
  look and then another quick one as if he
  couldnt believe the first

    oh hullo mr hume he said and
  his voice was different almost like the
  words tasted bad hed had to do busi-
  ness with hume too

    boysve got the first piece on the
  table he said lets have a look
  he unrolled the lay-out as he led them
  into the warehouse a big high and
  wide cavern that row of lights down
  the middle throwing shadows back into
  the orderly piles of shapes on each side
  and up beyond the big bridge crane over-
  head one light hung low over the table
  where the cutter was fussing with his
  torch

     generally art ge t a kick out of a plce
  like that at a time like that rest of the
  town asleep three-four guys dragged out
  of bed going to bat for somebody in
  trouble strutting their stuff so other
  dudes wouldnt be laid off come morn-
  ing but tonight his nostrils stung-no
  telling when hed be at it again in ear-
  nest that is not j ust staging a show

    the cutter looked at humes dress
  shirt and bit down on his chew

    when dyou think youre goin to get
  a swing on this one he asked art
  smoothing the lay-out

     eight oclock

    nuts  said the cutter and humes
  hand taking a cigarette up to his mouth
  stopped with a jerk not even you
  kid he said and grinned at art light-
  ing his torch

    the flame went from blue to orange
  and moved over to the steel and sparks
  fanned out the block commenced to
  glow under it turned cherry red below
  the torch the flame bit down sinking
  slowly into the metal at first then going
  through the whole ten inches like a knife
  through cheese

    eight oclock the cutter said as he
  commenced to send his flame creeping
  along hot dickety he said

    art tipped his head back for jensen

goldberger

  charge this to me-personal he said

  jensen scowled whats the idea 

  nev mind ill add it up someday
art said and jensen shrugged

  have it your own way he said and
looked at hume watching the cutter
work and his lips moved hed said
louse  under his bre ath

  art wasnt going to make the shop pay
the shot see hed pay his boys too
it would be worth ten times any cost to
take hume out on the streets with him
still he wondered how long hume would
stick around not because it was go-
ing to cost him money understand but
because he wasnt so sure how long he
could keep a show like that going and
fool everybody   

   it was twelve-thirty before the roughed-
out die was off the table and the crane
hook came swinging the piece that would
get to be a punch in its place

  ray the pick-up driver had reached
there by then he came in with his
shoulders hunched and his hands in his
pants pockets his eyes were red and he
yawned as he looked at the lay-out the
cutter said something to him and laughed
and ray looked at art sort of open-
mouthed

  jsight he said thatll be goin
some 

  art didnt answer he didnt let on
hed heard he turned and walked away
all stirred up inside slight up his street
understand tackling the things other
dudes thought couldnt be done had al-
ways been his meat see and this time
he didnt mean it he wasnt boring in-
to a job of work he was just playing a
game made him a little sick

  they watched the piunch burned out
and started back to the shop when
they walked in hume snapped out his
wrist and looked at his watch and said
y ten after one

  he said it like he expected art to say
something but art didnt he was
thinking this was the last tinje hed ever
come into that shop in the middle of the
night he was thinking it was like tieing
evicted from the house youve grown up
in he was thinking it would take him
years to get as hot abou t any other place
as hed been about this

old mac was just finishing with the
nibbler on a templet hans and
harry the shaper men hed routed out
were watching him they looked at
hume and gawped a little you dont
see a tuxedo very often in a job-shop

  how long we got on this one mac
asked as he wadded up a chew of snuff

  eight oclock art said

  old macs head kind of jerked for-
ward

  which eight he said and his gray
eyes crinkled

  holy old baldy  hans growled
have a heart boss

  well theres the doctor art said
tilting his head back to where hume had
stopped and it helped him a little to kind
of feel hume tightening up again get-
ting scared again everybody was cer-
tain what hume had to have done couldnt
be done and those doubts likely were like
knives being stuck in and twisted

sure he wanted hume to suffer that
was the big idea but he didnt get
much satisfaction out of it right then be-
cause he was doing a little suffering of
his own remembering things about old
man scolt and how sort of tranquil he
always was about the lift he used to get
when he got the hang of some machine
or metal about the other kids hed
taught things to and how theyd worked
their heads off for him

  he walked down to the long bench un-
der the windows where so many tough
jobs had been licked he stopped the
up-and-down shadows of belting by the
shapers hans and harry had the vises
off and were ready to go he laid  a
hand on a shaper almost like you might
do on somebodys shoulder something
about the feel of a cold machine that
warms a man-when hes grown up with
tools i mean and got to liking them

  hell with it  he said he couldnt
go soft when what he had to do called
for being hard as cold-rolled   

  the back door swung open

  come and git em  ray yelled from
out there and harry went loping back
to the presses for a truck and they eased
the roughed-out pieces down from the
pick-up and rolled them to the shapers
at a trot and all got around and lifted
that three-hundred-pounds-and-better of
die to the base

  the way they leaned into it got arts
goat a little they didnt think what
hed told them had to be done could be
done but they were trying their best
anyhow when they found out it was
only a stall theyd say it was all right of
course but at that it was kind of a dirty
business for a mechanics skill

  hell with it  he said again and
looked at hume to get hold of himself
a cigarette smoldered in humes hand
he stood bent over a little and almost
rigid watching those boys they had his
job in their hands remember

  hans got going first squaring up the
die bottom generally getting under
way on a rush job the slap of belts and
the grunt of shapers sort of soothed art
they didnt tonight he was all churn-
ing inside and tight across the middle

  nothing he could do if he wanted to
see  boss in a production-plant can stand
over his men and drive them you cant
do that in a job-shop your men are dif-
ferent or they wouldnt be there de-
pendable i mean and more than that
sort of an understanding that when you
tell a man to do this or that you trust
him to do it

  art commenced to stew because hume
didnt leave he commenced to sweat
wishing he would leave so he could come
clean with the boys and stop this monkey
business

but hume wasnt going to leave he
wasnt going to leave at all art
found that out when the truck came over
from clyde with the bumper blanks

  alb right then you can sleep in the
cab art heard hume say to the driver
but stay here ill be here all night
he said and that was something else for
art to get steamed up over

  he went out to his desk and tried to
figure it out other nights with things
started hed gone to his desk and sat
down and waited for something to go
wrong sat there sometimes for hours
expecting everything to go to hell in a
heap

  he didnt want anything to go wrong
tonight he wanted hume to know hed
been let down on purpose he wanted
hume to know that he could have been
pulled out of the jam he was in by this
shop if hed only acted like a white man
in the past he wanted-

  he lit his pipe with a shaking hand
and went on from there goldberged it
through from there he commenced to
grin when he saw it opening up com-
menced to grin like maybe a redskin
used to when he got ideas

  those boys out there didnt think it
could be done but so help him art did
he had the die material and hed have
bet his shirt it would work or could be
made to work and he knew those boys
better than they knew themselves why
when scolt was sick hed gotten old mac
off the booze and let him be the me-

chanic he could bs sober hed taken
hans in on a wild shot sloppy work-
man hans a give-a-damn machinist
but art had hyped him up made him
respect himself made him a lead-off man
anywhere and hed taught young harry
about all he knew yes they had what
a job like this took

  theyd turn it out they would theyd
get the die smoothed up and barbered
theyd get it set making channel sec-
tions woulclbe simple hed call men
for the break before long now theyd
get ready to try or e out along about sev-
en if luck stayed with them theyd
shove the blank in hed give her a kick
with the old press himself theyd take
it out and give it a look and hume would
be right in among them to see how it
gauged

  sure hume would be there art sat
up straighter in his chair and tossed his
pipe to the desk hume would be there
and see that bumper formed right up
to the line then it would be his turn

  whoa hed ay hold it hed
say and theyd all look up at him sort
of surprised

  this is as far as we go hed say to
hume this is the end of the line
hed say and hume would gawp 

  got a good memory hume hed
say recall the day you crossed me up
on that fixture job  hed say and do
you remember the truck-frame you re-
jected just to rub it in hed say

  oh that would be good that would
be fine he rubbed his hands on his
pants-legs so hard his chair squeaked

  well i dont happen to work here any
more hed say they threw me into
the street on account of you hed say

  the time these boys have put in to-
night is on me hed say i paid for
this steel and torching out these dummies
myself hed say and maybe reach for
a cold chisel im going to make junk
of it now hed say and scrap your
jobf hed say and from now-

  he broke off saying what hed say and
put in calls for the two more men hed
need then he sent ray over on mack
for a pail of coffee from a quick-and-dirty
and got out there where hed always lived
if you get me

they were jujt finishing squaring up
the bottoms mac was checking the
templets for the last time with his trams
art gave a hand turning the die on the
shaper base and watched like a coach
must watch a football team while mac
eiglit oclock the cutter said as he sent the flame creeping along hot dickety

scribed the steel around the templet and
hans got cutting again

  steel shavings crunched under arts
shoes and he lifted one foot and pulled
out a chip his wife always raised the
devil when he scratched the bathroom
floor well maybe she wouldnt have a
chance to razz him about that for a
while she was taking it hard and-

  he canned that he was going to form
metal now sobbing was ot he called
mac over and showed him the side plates
for the die and explained his idea of how
that section would form and mac nodded
and said it ought to work

  if we can figure the spring-back
mac said

  which im taking up with harry
right now art said going to put a
little angle in that punch he said
drawing with his pencil on a surface
plate about so see then we can
shim the die if we have to and kick her
up to line

  mac chuckled

  thats copperin all bets  he said-
and art felt proud

  he put mac tearing a goldberg out
of the big hydraulic press he went back
to the break himself carrying the blue-
print to get ready for the boys coming
on pretty soon his last job maybe but
he was going to drain it of all the kick
it had

it was two oclock before harry got
smoothing up the punch it was two-
thirty when the other men showed up
at three art was satisfied the flanging
was as simple and easy as hed figured
and he started a fire in the forge and set
the coffee-pail there to warm

  hume came back it was a bet he
wanted to say something but didnt know
what to say he drank coffee out of a
paper cup and dribbled some on his shirt-
front he talked a little about nothing
much though
the blue book magazine

  well how does it look to you he
asked finally hated to ask it likely
hated to let on he wasnt sure himself

  all right so far art said you
never can tell when somethingll go
wrong though he said and went over to
the press figuring that wouldnt make
hume feel any easier

  hans shaper commenced to hog it
he had to stop and make a change

  four oclock-and harry sung out for
art

  look her over he said and art did
and found a couple of high spots and got
a grinder and bartered it a little him-
self and there was the punch anyhow
ready to be drilled

  quarter to five before they were drill-
ing and tapping for the base- and side-
lates on the die though quarter to
ve with hume like an animal in a zoo
cage walking i mean up and down
up and back turning on his heel light-
ing one cigarette from another

  you could hear trucks going by out-
side by then town stirring in its sleep
getting ready for another day in two
hours bumpers should be starting across
town

  the punch was ready they lugged it
across to the old press and art began to
set it on the ram himself his hands
werent any too steady his wrench
went rat-tat-tat-tat every now and then
against metal that wasnt from too
much coffee that wasnt from being
tired either he wasnt tired at all he
was all hyped up he was cutting this
buck-if hed been right about spring-
back-and was going to swing on hume
before very long now double satis-
faction 

whole night gone whole night up
the spout down a rat-hole why
hume likely couldnt get bumpers in
twenty-four hours any other place may-
be not even then oh it was going to be
good it was going to be-

  all right lads  art said lets all
get on this die shes a brute and were
all tired he said

  he could see hume shuffling along be-
side him as if he too helped lug a load
well he was lugging a load all right all
right more of a load than he knew a
load that was going to get him down now
any minute any old minute

  then ran extension-lights in for art
and he leaned in on the bed had a lot
of stuff there to box that die in to use
for gauges understand to hold the blank

in place while it rode up to the punch
hed planned that during the night too
but it took time to set it up you dont
goldberg in a hurry

something different about the place
when he finally backed out and stood
up and stretched his back corners were
nearer windows were different that
was daylight coming hume was look-
ing at his watch

  what time art asked and wanted
to laugh

  five to seven hume said and sort
of choked

  all right lets go art said and his
voice wasnt quite right either in a
minute now hed know how well hed
done one of his jobs

  old mac brought over a flanged blank
and set one end against the gauges art
spun the control-wheel and she started to
talk

  old old press bed a little loose pump-
shafts clattered plenty out at clyde-
barst truck or any production-shop
theyd have hooted at it but art knew
it the way a musician knows his fiddle

  up she went with seven hundred fifty
tons of pressure in her guts the pc
tion stirred in macs hands sort of vi-
brated art flipped the wheel and escap-
ing oil gurgled out and the bed fell away
and there it was vith one end formed

  the boys came into a huddle over it
not a wrinkle smooth as satin blit be-
fore anybody could say anything old mac
clapped a templet on the radius

 oh-oh somebody said-and hume
made something like a whimper

  hells bells  somebody else growled
and spit and you heard it spatter

  off five-sixteenths growled mac
youd figured-

  itll have to be to the line cut in
hume his voice cracked and he drew
in breath so you could hear it weve
got a tolerance of a thirty-second he
said inspection wont pass it  he said
theyll reject- why you damned
gold-

  he sort of choked up then every-
body looked at him nobody spoke
big shot going to pieces see brass hat
kind of hysterical

  hold it said art looking hard at
hume but that wasnt starting the speech
hed planned hold it he said youve
only seen the first act

  hans some fiber shimming stuff
he said well try a quarter-inch and
see what a harder kickll do


goldberger

  you cant always tell what steel will
do understand  it wont always act the
same way art had figured on that giv-
en himself an out maybe remember
you never can tell

  they got the shimming material with
hume standing so close he got in the way
mac did the cutting and his hands shook
excited hed worked all night on a
hard one and couldnt tell how theyd
made out you cant tell about steel

  they could hear trafiic by then guys
going to work guys heading for clyde
truck maybe art swallowed when he
thought of that

  the shims went in on the die mac
picked up another section the press
commenced to rattle no die true to a
thousandth as youd find in a big shop
keep that in mind dummy die made in
the night dummy die shimmed up
and no man operating the press who had
only to slap a button and watch her op-
erate man there who knew the old baby
who knew the sound and the feel of her
like youll know your own kid

  arts knees bent a little as she groaned
he held it held it longer than he had
at first when he let her go he let his
breath go too

  nbody said anything they squatted
in a circle around the piece all but
hume he hung over them one hand
pulling at his coat

  to the line said mac and shoved
back his cap as he got up

art looked at the gang they all
 seemed pleased tired but pleased
dirty and red-eyed and a little gray
around the mouths but pleased

  art looked at hume he took a long
breath now was his time this was
the minute hed waited for he even had
a cold chisel in his pocket

  he took a long breath-and then he
thought oh what the hell  funny things
went on inside him he thought he was
thinking that it was a di rty trkk to drag
those swell boys into spite workbut
that wasnt it not all of it

  away down deep he was thinking
something like this there are heels on
earth and always will be and you just get
along with them somehow and that a
good man can generally get another job
and that his specialty was getting folks
out of trouble something like a doctor
and it didnt matter who or what they
were

  and he was good and hf ppy over crack-
ing that tough one too and he figured

it was after all better to walk out for
keeps with something like that fresh be-
hind you than any other way

  so he didnt say what hed intended

what he said was

  any minute now well have two-
three fresh boys showing up who know
this press as well as i do likely we can
knock out eighteen-twenty an hour we
can run twenty-four hours that okay

hume 

  hume didnt even answer he just
started to run for the phone but from
the way he ran you knew it was all okay

  art turned back he wanted to form
a few more bumpers hed formed four
when hans touched his shoulder

  man to see you hans said

it was connolly it was connolly
looking queer

  whos in the office he asked in
dinner clothes phoning

  thats hume said art from
clyde-barst truck

  well  said connolly i thought i
knew him he said and hes- well
hes ordering a lot of work sent here
he said and i dont know whats hap-
pened but it looks like a lot of good news

and of course he said that is-if you
havent-if you want to-if you will i
mean-	

  so art said okay and blinked some
and nodded to mac to shove in another
section-and that made five bumpers for
clyde

  he had eight behind him when the
crew commenced to string in he left
the press and started over toward the
forge and the coffee-pail he wiped his
neck off with a piece of waste having
commenced to sweat some he looked v
around when hume yelled at him

  hume walked in long steps he didnt
seem to be tired or jittery any more

when he got up close he stuck out his
hand but artdidnt take it he just
rolled the waste between his-so hume
put his hand on arts shoulder

  old man he said that certainly was
pretty work  he said and clapped arts
shoulder ive never seen better he
said and clapped it again i just want
to tell you that i think youre a genius 

  arts eyes got pretty cold for a min-
ute then they warmed up and he
grinned

  genius  he said and shook his head

no hume youve got me wrong no
genius hume just another goldberger

just another goldberger

this novelette by a writer
new to our pages offers you
a detective - story with a
south seas background

cole dexton opened his eyes
and saw by the light of the
lantern the guard carried in his
left hand that it was gaston of
the sad mustache who stood over him and
prodded him in the ribs with a rifle butt

  wake up my sweet one gaston said
in his deep voice which was richly flav-
ored with a bouquet blended of tahitian
rum and a sour pipe monsieur le ad-
ministrates commands you to present
yourself at his office

  chan lee who shared dextons mats
raised himself on his elbow and asked
wassa mallah 

he walked ahead of gas-
ton from the shack where
the prisoners slept

probably im to be shot at sunrise
dexton said ive no particular objec-
tion to that he sat up and watched
gaston unlock his leg-shackle ill crab
though if theyre turning me out at this
time of night to dig my own grave

he saw by the stars that it was not
much after midnight when he walked
ahead of gaston from the shack where
the prisoners slept with soft coolnessj
the night breeze caressed his body bare-
to the waist-a breeze made fetid by its
sweep across the foul mud of the man-j
grove swamp now uncovered by the ebb
tide the tide was low he knew a few
minutes before eleven oclock now it
had begun to flow again he could tell
that by the low moaning sound the sea
made against the outer reef

the administrators bungalow was a
squat square little building set up on a
foundation of fcasalt slabs and roofed
with steel a wide screened veranda
faced it on all four sides the front side

ilver

by herman
petersen

   bautain used as his office a light burned
   there now and as dexton went up the
   walk toward the steps he saw the ad-
   ministrator seated at the table that served
   him for a desk

     a plump short man antoine bautain
   round and pleasant of face a bald spot at
   the crown of his head he nodded when
   dexton opened the screened door and
   walked across the width of the veranda
   to stand before the table and he tugged
   at a hair of his closely clipped mustache
   r and said to gaston

     that is all my thirsty one you may
   go and look in the jug and see if there is a
   drop left

     gaston took himself off with lantern
   anckrifle to look for the drop in the jug

     the administrator gestured toward a
   chair which was drawn ip close to the end
   of the table by the jvall

      sit down msfcur he directed and he
   moved some papers about on the table
   moved them into the bright circle of light
   reflected downward by the white glass
   shade of the kerosene lamp

     dexton sat in the chair there were
   straws blowing in the wi nd but it was too
   dark for him to see which way they
   pointed

     bautain was tousled sleepy-eyed evi-
   dently the administrator like himself
   had been roused from sound slumber not
   very many minutes in the past the pa-
   pers on the table were newspaper clip-
   pings pinned together	 -

 the administrator sat back in his
 chair and cocked his head a bit on
 one side

   cole dexton-that is your real name
 msieur 

   dexton nodded he had given his real
 name the day he had landed on the island
 without a passpbrt without a sou in his
 pockets he had come to heeva with the
 trading schooner tahitian girl from pa-
 peete and he had gone to sleep under
 some palms on the beach the tahitian

illustrated by l r gustavson
the blue book magazine

girl had sailed away gaston of the sad
mustache from the drooping ends of
which gastons tears sometimes dripped
-gaston had found him under the palms
and had dragged him before bautain
the island code had a tooth in it meant
to discourage beachcombers bautain had
let him feel the bite of that tooth by
sentencing him to a year at hard labor
he had given bautain his real name that
day he had had to they had found
some letters in one of his pockets his
name on the envelopes but he had re-
fused to give any information about him-
self

  cole dexton is my real name he said
now to bautain but it doesnt mean a
thing

 no

bautain picked up the pinned-to-
gether clippings and passed them
across the table

  dexton opened his eyes quite wide
when he read the by-line of the first one
his own name  it was on the by-lines of
all the clippings his stories on the wel-
ford murder case clipped from the ex-
aminer

  it means bautain said that you
were a police reporter you are the man
who as you americans say broke the
welford case by discovering the clue that
led to the much-wanted murderer

  dexton shrugged a shoulder he won-
dered how the administrator had come
by the clippings

  it means the administrator con-
tinued that you are the man who dis-
appeared shortly after that welford case
was broken just the other day i heard
your name broadcast over the radio one
of those amazing columnists of the air
you have in america said that a woman
was the reason for your disappearance
he smiled of course a frenchman can
very easily believe that

  okay dexton admitted he tossed
the clippings to the table im the guy

i	had a girl who turned out to be a tramp

i	started traveling so what

  so you are here

  dexton helped himself to a cigarette
from a package open on the table he
stood up to light it in the hot blast from
the chimney of the lamp then he sat in
the chair again

  did you wake me up in the middle of
the night to tell me this he demanded
no    come with me

  dexton followed the administrator from
the veranda and then across the sand

toward the incoming tide a number of
outriggers were beached above the high
water mark along the shore

  help me launch one bautain di-
rected

  the two men dragged a canoe to the
water and floated it

  ill paddle bautain said and he
paddled the little craft toward a yawl
anchored in the moat inside the reef

  a light burned in the cabin of the yawl
bautain bumped the outrigger alongside
he ordered dexton to climb aboard with
the painter and make fast

  the administrater went down the com-
panionway into the cabin

  the ship lamp swung gently to and fro
sweeping the shadow of its base back and
forth across the dead man who lay on the
stained decking almost in the middle of
the cramped space

  cole dexton had seen the man before
when with the other prisoners of the
work-gang he had labored on the coral
road in the broiling sun the man several
times had passed him-a tall very thin
white-haired man with stooped shoulders
eyes squinted behind thick lenses set in
white gold frames he had always dressed
in badly soiled whites and he had worn a
sun helmet once he had spoken to iex-
ton

  building roads in this sun must be
tough son he had said

  now he lay prone sprawled out on the
stained boards just beyond the foot of
the companion ladder

  his head was turned to the left the
right side of his face pressed against the
decking he seemed not to have fallen
into this position but to have settled down
slowly like a man sapped of his strength
so that first his legs gave away and then
his arms his spectacles were still in
place on his nose the bows hooked behind
his ears

a few drops of blood had oozed from
a wound in his neck just enough to
form a thin trickle which had run down
across his throat it was dark in color
the fresh brightness gone from it but it
was not dry the neck area about the
wound was puffed and somewhat dis-
colored

  looks as if the jugular were punc-
tured dexton said but it didnt bleed
very much he hasnt been dead long

  he squatted on bare heels beside the
body took one of the dead mans arms by
the wrist lifted it and let it fall it fell
limply


ten pieces of silver

  not more than a couple hours he
said of course were in the tropics here
that makes a lot of difference-but he
hasnt been dead very long

  he looked up at bautain

  and he didnt die instantly there
were a number of minutes between the
time he was wounded and the time death
actually occurred not many minutes
perhaps-i think it worked quickly but
there was a lapse of time

  bautain asked what was it msieur 
do you know 

  dexton rasped his hand against the
blond bristles of his hair which had been
clipped close a month before he shook
his head

  i dont know i can make a guess-
poison some particular potent poison

he still squatted or bare heels by the
body all he had on was a pair of
very dirty white cotton trousers his
skin burned to the color of brown ma-
hogany wore the gleam of sweat it was
hot in the cabin

  what about native poisons he asked
bautain who stood beside him i mean
for poisoning darts or arrows its a
thought that just popped into my head
the natives of these islands never
were given to the use of poisons for such
purposes bautain told him

  i didnt know dexton said you
see i dont know very much about these
islands about all i know to date is that
beachcombers are outla wed

  he looked at the body again and he
frowned slightly the frown made three
vertical lines between his eyebrows he
had a long face the cheekbones promi-
nent because his cheeks were hollow

  it couldnt have been a beachcomber
he said as if he thought aloud there
arent any beachcombers and it prob-
ably wasnt a native because the na-
tives here dont use poison like that
who- bautain began he broke off
and shrugged ah oui-whe that is
the question is it not msieur 
yes dexton agreed who and
why  always those two questions they
are the tough ones there are always
plenty of other tough questions but those
two are always the worst

  he stood up

  who he asked bautain is he
doctor henry duane the adminis-
trator named the dead man he comes
from chicago in the united states he is
a scientist a biologist his special inter-
est is zoogeography he has made several

previous visits to these islands in pursuit
of his studies

  hes made his last visit dexton said
hes all caught up with his studies

  he was-murdered  youthink that 
i think so dexton nodded he
looked sharply at bautain so do you
you thought so when you had me turned
out in the middle of the night you
thought so when you sprung those news-
paper clippings on me and let me know
you were wise to my identity

  out bautain admitted

  okay dexton said lets have the
rest of it where do i fit in 

  bautain pointed at the dead man

can you solve that riddle msieur
the cramped cabin was low for a tall
man and cole dexton was tall he sat
down on one of the steps of the compan-
ion ladder he looked at bautain

  i dont know whether i can solve the
riddle or not    suppose i said that i
have no desire to try

  you have friends in the united states
with whom you can arrange for the loan
of five thousand francs when your sen-
tence of a year at hard labor ends 
thats out dexton said im not
borrowing

  you must have five thousand francs
when your present sentence terminates
otherwise you will be arrested again and
sentenced again to the work-gang

  does it go on and on like that 
  that is the law msieur

  i seem to be in a predicament with a
nice future on my hands

  bautain nodded

  and i he said am the adminis-
trator of these islands with a murdered
man on my hands that is not nice
msieur it is also a predicament
meaning about the record 

  oui

  it must be kept clean or-

  or else bautain said

dexton grinned at the adminis-
trators slang evidently bautain
tuned his radio to many american broad-
casts

  somebody gunning for your job or
dont they play politics on this side of the
line

  on the line and on both sides of it
msieur it is a game played the world
around and this island of heeva has not
been forgotten

  so it behooves you to solve this mur-
der riddle or get a blot on the record
isnt the record allowed one blot


-

  it already has a blot msieur bau-
tain told him about six months ago a
murder was done here the assassin is
still at large he lifted a shoulder in a
shrug i am not a detective

  dexton nodded bautain had given him
enough light that he could see a straw or
two and so make a reasonable guess as to
which way the wind blew

  you want me to front for you
  front

  i solve the riddle and you take the
credit

  ah out

then i go back to building roads
nan the administrator exploded
his indignation that dexton should sug-
gest such a thing what kind of an un-
grateful pig do you think i would be 
you tell me

  immediate termination of your sen-
tence bautain told him five thou-
sand francs in cash and a place to live

until a schooner comes one on which you
can arrange for passage to papeete
sold dexton accepted the terms in-
stantly im not saying that i can solve
your riddle but ill take a stab at it
bautain smiled happily and made a
sweeping gesture with his hand

  stab away msieur

  dexton did not immediately move from
his seat on the step of the companion lad-
der he narrowed his eyes and made a
slow survey of the cabin

  forward of the port settle a desk was
built into the bulkhead a desk with a lid
opening downward to serve as a writing
board this lid was now open and on it

how long ago did you
hear of his death  dexton
asked the administrator
was a deep disorder of papers a brief
case lay open on the sentle

  bautain moved as if he intended to seat
himself on that port side seat dexton
stopped him with a word

  wait  then he said  the doctor
was sitting there at that desk writing or
working with those papers theyre prob-
ably notes

  oui he often did that he didnt
seem to mind the heat bautain said
and he liked to be alone here where no
one would disturb him 

omeone certainly disturbed him
tonight    how long ago did you
hear of his death 

  just a few minutes-not more than
five-before i sent gaston to arouse you
joseph brought me the word

  who is joseph

  a native bautain said one of the
older ones years ago he was a tahuna
a tahuna

  a native priest the administrator ex-
plained like a wizard or a witch-doc-
tor-or a medicine-mari of your indians
i see  you say he was a tahuna
years ago what did he do that he isnt
one now  see the light 

  j-ie accepted christianity and was
baptized he took the name joseph
okay    how did joseph discover
the doctor was dead 

  he had been fishing bautain replied
he was paddling toward shore when he
observed the light in the cabin here he
came alongside looked in through a port
and saw the doctor lying on the floor
he could have looked in through the
port and seen the doctor at his desk
oui

  and if he had any motive for doing it
he could have jabbed a spear through the
same port and nicked the doctor in the
neck dexton added if once upon a
time he practiced as a medicine man he
undoubtedly knew a few things about a
poison or two ill bet his baptism didnt
wash that knowledge away

  bautain lifted both hands in protest
mon dieu you must not suspect
joseph 

  no listen dexton said at the
beginning im eliminating myself and the
other boys with me in the prison shack
tonight we were shackled to our beds
so we couldnt have dene it but every- 
body else on this island including you is
a suspect

 me with both hands bautain
touched himself on the chest then he

  shrugged spread his hands apart palms
turned up i was in bed too

  okay dexton said

  he stood up stepped to where the body
of doctor duane lay he rolled the body
over on its back

  hello he exclaimed when he had
done that look what weve found  

  on the decking lay a shaft of wood
eleven or twelve inches long perhaps not
quite a half inch in diameter near it lay
a small cylinder of brass close by the
brass cylinder was a sliver of bone three
inches or so in length which had been
pushed through the center of a small
wooden button

  dieu bautain said softly the
weapon 

  squatted on his heels dexton picked
up the shaft

  that brass ferrule or whatever it is
was fitted to one end of this he took
the brass piece in his fingers its a
forty-five caliber cartridge-case and the
head has been cut off one end has been
crimped in a little

  he reached for the sliver of bone

  be careful bautine warned him
sharply

  dexton did not touch the needle-sharp
point

  its a hollow needle the bones been
drilled out he said he studied it for
some minutes then- i get it the
button just fits into the cartridge-case
like this he shoved the needle through
the cylinder drew the button down into
the tube toward the crimped end now
the whole business fits onto the end of the
shaft-like this

with the cylinder fitted to the end
of the shaft he could slide needle
and button back and forth in the tube
like a piston as he did so a drop of fluid
appeared on the end of the needle

  there you are a crude but never-
theless very effective hypodermic

  diable bautain exclaimed softly
the poison was in that cartridge-case 
right  dexton nodded toward the
port settle the doctor was sitting there
at the desk working over his papers
someone shot this thing through the port
and popped him in the neck there was
enough force behind the throw to drive
the needle into his jugular at the same
time the momentum of the shaft caused
the needle and button to operate like a
plunger with the result that the fluid in
the hollow was forced out through the
needle
the blue book magazine

  and it killed him 

  yeah-but not right away i dont
know what the stuff was or just how it
acted it acted swiftly but the doctor
had time enough to jump up and away
from that side of the cabin of course
that was a more or less natural reflex
action he had time too to jerk the
shaft and needle away pull it from his
neck it evidently came apart when he
did that then he must have begun to
weaken and sink down

  he crossed over to the desk picked up
a paper or two and scanned the writing
on them

  notes just as i thought

  he began to put the papers together
and arrange them in a pile while he was
doing that he uncovered an opened pack-
age of cigarettes he took one passed
the package to bautain

i hope there are some matches too
there was a box of safety matches
there was also a small drawer which had
been pulled from the desk it lay upside
down and empty under several papers

dexton lighted his cigarette held
the flaming match toward bautain
these papers-i cant believe the doc-
tor left them in such disorder  i think
whoever pinked him waited for him to
take the count and then came aboard and
down here

  to search for something
apparently dexton nodded that
would explain the mess these notes are in
probably it explains why this drawer is
out it might have been in the drawer-
whatever it was

  dexton finished putting the papers into
a pile

  well take them along he said and
he put them into the brief-case with
them he carefully packed the dart we
might as well go ashore now there
doesnt seem to be any more we can do
here    its a good bet that the killer
came out in an outrigger or a boat of
some kind well have a look at those on
the shore

  when they were ashore bautain went
to the bungalow for a lantern they be-
gan a tour of the beach when he returned
with the light

  within a minute or so they found the
marks where an outrigger had been
dragged across the wet sand uncovered by
the ebb tide the canoe had been pulled
to the dry sand above the high water
mark the man who beached the tiny
craft had been barefoot

  thats josephs canoe bautain iden-
tified the outrigger

  joseph is number one on my list
dexton declared he was on the spot
and being an ex-tahuna he has im sure
a working knowledge of some poisons
but what motive-

  i dont know dexton admitted mo-
tives are seldom easy to get at im not
doing motives right now im looking for
clues i can see with both eyes

  a score or more of outriggers were
strung along the beach among them
were two whaleboats

  those are mine bautain said
neither of the whaleboats had been
launched

  if you did it dexton remarked
you used one of the canoes

  several of the outriggers had been
launched and beached again bautain
was able to identify most of the canoes
and name the owners of them the names
he gave dexton were those of natives

  they were out fishing he said
spearing by torchlight there is nothing
at all unusual about that

  one name however which bautain
gave dexton was that of a white man-
roger putnam his canoe a small one
with a single outrigger had been tfsed
during the night

  an american-from the states bau-
tain informed dexter hes been here
about ten years it is with putnam that
doctor duane always stays when he
comes here and t is putnams yawl on
which the doctor now lies dead
abruptly dexton halted

  putnam has elephantiasis of the feet
and legs

 why no bautain replied he
seemed surprised why do you ask
that

  look at his footprints i suppose they
are footprints i never saw any quite like
them

the marks in the sand to which dex-
ton pointed were oval in shape all of
a foot wide and eighteen inches long

  if we were under the big dipper in-
stead of the southern cross and if this
were snow instead of wet sand id say he
wore small bear-paw snowshoes dexter
said do you know what snowshoes
are 

  of course bautain declared a shade
of annoyance in his voice ive never
seen them but ive read about them and
seen pictures of thm they are a frame
with webwork woven between-


ten pieces of silver

  thats good enough dexter said
the shoes that made these prints didnt
have any webbing they were made of
canvas or something like that

  dieul the mud-shoes of the doctor
perhaps 

  what dyou mean-mud-shoes
r like little canvas boats he puts
them on his feet when he goes out on the
tide flats where there is mud instead of
sand they support him so he doesnt
sink down and become mired

  well thats an idea  dexton lighted
another cigarette from the package he
had found on the yawl theyd hide
footprints too

  they had a look at the other outriggers
but they found nothing more to interest
them

  we might as well go to the house
dexton said

at the bungalow dexton took over the
 table bautain used for a desk he
moved the lamp to one end and on the
cleared space of the table-top he deposited
the contents of the brief-case the dart
with its needle-point of bone he very care-
fully put aside

  then he drew up bautains chair and
whh he had seated himself and lighted
another cigarette he began to look over
the papers one by one

  im goingto dressbautain said he
went into the house and soon dexton
heard him moving about in the cook-
shack when he returned to the veranda
garbed in fresh whiles he carried a
smoke-blackened steaming coffee-pot and
two cups

  boy dexton exclaimed his eye-
brows elevated when he had tipped back
his chair and taken a sip of the black
brew did you float an egg on this 
non when it lifted the cover from
the pot i knew it had strength want
some cognac in it 

  no that might lift my top    ive
found a letter in the doctor brief-case
its from a sister written to him just be-
fore he sailed from san francisco

  bautain made himself comfortable in
the other chair and cocked his feet up on
the table he lighted a cigarette

  what about it  he wanted to know
reading between he lines dexter
told him i gather that the sister-her
name is lillian-has a son who has been
away from home a long time something
like ten years through the doctor she
sends the boy her love-and some money
the boys name is tom

  bautain shrugged and sipped coffee
theres a little more dexton went
on he put down his emptied cup with
his index finger he tapped a book with a
black cover that lay among the papers
the doctors diary he opened it and
turned several pages two months ago
the day before yesterday he made this
entry dexton read  arrived at heeva
today found tom looking well but
older 

  eh bautain took his feet from the
table but there is no tom here

  you should know you keep the offi-
cial dossiers

  from the diary he took a newspaper
clipping a column wide half a column
long

  this is very interesting i shant read
it to you you must do that at your lei-
sure it is dated at los angeles three
months ago

  what is it about

  the death of a certain mrs waring
dexton said she apparently died quite
a natural death but ten years ago she
was one of the principals involved in a
death-of another person of course-that
was extremely violent a shooting in
fact another principal in the affair was
thomas salisbury thomas vanished
bautain flung his cigarette to the floor
and stamped a foot on it with a violence
that jarred the whole veranda

 diable what goes on under my
nose 

  a little of this and a little of that
take a scent and see what you can run
down

bautain poured another cup of the
black coffee lighted a fresh cigarette
his round usually pleasant face wore a
dark frown of perplexity

  take a scent-ouil but from where
he demanded where do i begin  with
whom

  why not try roger putnam  dexton
suggested you said he had been here
about ten years you said too that doc-
tor duane stayed with putnam used his
yawl to get about among the islands that
he did the same thing on previous visits
here

  dieu his dark eyes very round
bautain stared at dexton and he poised
his hands a cup of coffee in one a ciga-
rette in the other you think putnam
might be thomas salisbury

  its possible he is one and the same
person dexton said its been done be-
fore you know-relatives hustle a man
out of the country and then pay him to
stay away remittance-man stuff

  if putnam is thomas salisbury then
he is wanted in the united states for mur-
der bautain gulped coffee banged the
emptied cilp down on the table he
jumped up i shall arrest him at once
you havent a warrant dexton re-
minded the administrator

  poujl bautain made an impatient
gesture i dont need one this isnt
america this is heeva we have dif-
ferent laws here that i suspect putnam
of being doctor duanes assassin is about
all the reason i need to put him under
restraint

  okay youre the administrator
dexton poured himself another cup of
coffee it might be a good idea in more
ways than one to lock him up if hes
innocent-well maybe with him under
lock and key the guilty party will be
thrown off guard that would be a help

when batttain acted officially he
acted swiftly he shouted for gas-
ton  and with the guard and dexton trail-
ing him he went directly to roger put-
nams house gaston carried a lantern

  the night had yet two hours to live
when the administrator with his two com-
panions arrived at the house and climbed
the steps to the veranda the door of the
screened enclosure was not locked bau-
tain pushed it open and entered

  monsieur putnam he said loudly
you are under arrest

  putnam had been asleep in a ham-
mock slung across the righthand end of
the veranda now he put his feet to the
floor and stood up a man taller than bau-
tain but not so plumply built he had on
white pajamas both coat and trousers
and he blinked in the light of the lantern
which gaston held high

  on a cot at the other end of the veranda
a young man raised himself to a sitting
position he too blinked in the lantern
light

  bautain repeated monsieur putnam
you are under arrest

  but-but- putnam looked from one
to the other of the three men but what
for his voice had a nervous jerkiness
to it

  bautain lifted a shoulder in a quick
shrug

doctor duane was found dead on your
yawl tonight-murdered the murderer
used your outrigger to paddle out to the
yawl and commit the foul deedr
putnam protested but i didnt-

  bautain stopped him with a gesture

  i am not examining you now msieur
that will come later he turned to
gaston take him away and see that
you guard him well

  when putnam had put on his shoes and
picked up his clothing gaston marched
him away

  bautain turned to dexton and ques-
tioned him with lifted eyebrows

  gaston had taken the lantern with him
but there was a lamp on the table which
was pushed against the wall near the end
of the veranda where the cot stood dex-
ton lighted the lamp and then he stood
with his hands in his trousef pockets and
looked down at the young man who sat
on the cot

  who are you  dexton asked

  my name is byron baker the young
mans voice was husky his smooth face
very serious i am one of doctor duanes
students he brought me down here with
him to do some field work

  baker-he was about twenty-kept his
eyes screwed together while he talked a
pair of spectacles lay on the end of the
table near the cot dexton handed them
to the young man

  thank you baker said and he ut
on the glasses

  dont mention it    what were you
up to tonight

  i spent the evening writing up notes
  did you work here

  yes sir

  ive been crowned a few times in my
life but never knighted dexton said
my name is cole dexton im from
the u s myself then he asked you
worked here at thisi table 

  yes

there was a notebook near the lamp
and several neat piles of loose papers
each pile weighted with a stone two
fountain pens and eight pencils of dif-
ferent lengths formed a precise row

  did you leave the house at all to-
night

  no i didnt

  how about putnam 

  he went out about nine oclock and
came back around midnight i was in
bed i had been asleep he awakened
me

  know where he went 

  no

  own a gun 

  i have a revolver i brought it from
home with me the doctor suggested it
might be useful
  no ill bet its nickel-plated and has
mother-of-pearl handles

  why yes baker said he nodded
that describes it

  i thought it would  i understand
doc was in the habit of writing up his
notes on the yawl is that why he went
out tonight 

  it was one reason baker said he
wanted to see joseph loo

  the ex-takuna

  im afraid i dont understand
joseph is an elderly native dexton
explained

  baker nodded that would be he i
am sure the doctor wanted to question
him about pelamis bicolor

  now youve got me dexton had to
admit is she blonde or brunette
baker smiled

  both really he said its a sea-
snake the upper part of the body is
black the lower part yellow they occur
in the waters here but they are not exact-
ly easy to find the doctor has man-
aged to catch several since we have been
here he preserved two in alcohol and
he secured the venom from the others
venom  from sea-snakes 

  oh yes indeed  baker exclaimed
they are very venomous perhaps as
venomous as any poisonous snake known
fortunately they are shy creatures and
seldom attack a swimmer or diver when

caught however they strike very readily
they do not live very long when removed
from the water

  im glad to know that    why was
doc so interested in them

  he was collecting specimens and ven-
om for professor hampden baker ex-
plained the professor had hoped to
accompany the doctor this trip but he
was unable to do so

  a colleague of the doctor 

  yes

 how does that sea-snake venom
work know anything about it

  very little ive never gone very deep-
ly into that subject

  suppose a shot of it was injected into
a large vein do you know what would
happen dexton asked

  i believe it would cause coagulation
of the blood very quickly baker said
clotting you understand

  and when the clot or clots reached the
heart

death would occur due to embolism
how long would that take  from the
time the venom was injected i mean
i dont know baker said i think
it wouldnt take very long

  did doc keep the venom he had col-
lected in the drawer of that desk on the

 where is it 

 in one of my bags in the house they
 are in the front room

 whats the caliber

 thirty-two center fire shall i get
 it

 dexton shook his head

the oriental lifteil
the revolver out of
the coat
the blue book magazine

yawl dexton then asked the young
man

  he kept money there baker replied
silver mostly he hired natives to help
us quite often and he kept a supply of
coins on hand with which to pay them
the venom is here in the house

  lets have a look at it

  baker rose slipped his bare feet into
shoes and took up the lamp from the table

 dexton and bautain followed him
through the house to a rear room

  phew dexton gasped pickling
alcohol why you fellows dont go in
for at least a cheap grade of whisky-
benches were arranged about the room
on the benches were many glass jars and
bottles all sizes of them baker went to
one of the benches where he set the lamp
down while he scanned the labels on a row
of bottles

  why  he exclaimed after a minute or
so it isnt here it was in a glass-
stoppered bottle like these and it was
very plainly labeled    its gone 

bautain swore and dexton grinned
now administrator he said sooth-
ingly keep your shirt on things like
this happen every now and then especial-
ly when a murder has been done

  you are not surprised that the bottle
is gone bautain demanded

  i believe i would have been surprised
if baker with a flourish of the hand had
produced the bottle and said here my
man is the deadly dope  or words to
that effect    no im not surprised
you think the venom was used to
poison the doctor

  dexton nodded i think so it fits
in

  he strolled about the room one bench
held a number of tools-a hammer three
files a pair of pliers a jackknife a draw-
shave a small plane two saws a spool of
fine copper wire an assortment of nails in
a tin cam in a tin cover now serving as a
tray were a dozen or so of needlelike
pieces of bone varying from two to four
or five inches in length

 what are these  dexton asked
baker

  spines cut from fish vertebrae the
young man said i have been trying to
make a spear like those the natives use
for small fish

  a small pile of wood-shavings had been
swept under the bench in the corner by
the door stood the shaft from which they
evidently had been shaved a shaft a half
inch in diameter and about eight feet

long dexton looked it over examined
both ends then he returned it to the
corner

  he turned to baker

  lets have a look at the rest of the
house

  there were four rooms all of them
barely furnished

  we live on the veranda most of the
time baker said if it storms so that
rain blows in on the veranda then the
doctor and i sleep here in the front room
mr putnam room is over there he
nodded toward the left

  lets have a look

  it was a small room with one window
at one end was a cot a chair beside it at
the other end of the room near the door
was a bureau

  dexton pulled open the top drawer of
the bureau-it made a dry squealing
sound-and he pawed through the jumble
of clothing it contained he brought up a
long quite thick leather wallet and then
a heavier object wrapped in cloth

  his interest was first in the cloth-
wrapped object he unwrapped it and
disclosed a revolver a blued steel weapon
with black grips

  dexton glanced at the muzzle end
thirty-eight he said and he wrapped
the gun in the cloth again and tossed it
back into the drawer

  popguns he muttered the place
is full of popguns  

  he gave his attention to the wallet
there were a few banknotes in it to-
gether with several travelers checks

  look here he said to bautain he
placed the checks in a row on top of the
bureau these total two thousand dol-
lars-and every one of them is signed by
doctor duane

  bautain studied the display

tjave we not perhaps uncovered a
  motive he asked after a little

  you mean robbery 

 on the yawl we found empty the
drawer of the desk where the doctor kept
money bautain reminded him

  dexton picked up the travelers checks
and returned them to the wallet he
handed the wallet to bautain

  youd better take care of this he
looked at baker and grinned youd
better get dressed son and then dig your-
self up some brealcfast it looks as if
youll have to go on your own for a few
days he chuckled im a bit better
off than you are the administrator is
taking care of me


ten pieces of silver

   back at the administrators bungalow
 cole dexton borrowed bautains soap
 and razor and shaved in the cook-shack
 a buxom barefoot native woman bau-
 tains housekeeper prepared breakfast
 bautain went off to the store to get dex-
 ton a shirt a pair of trousers and a pair of
 canvas shoes

   the two men ate their breakfast at the
 table on the veranda

   ill have to have the body brought
 ashore for burial bautain said when
 they were finished with the meal when
 that has been attended to i shall ex-
 amine monsieur putnam

   youd better gather up young baker
 and keep him in tow dexton suggested
 bautain stared

  why

   the bone point on the dart used to kill
 the doctor is a piece of fish-spine like
 those on the bench at putnams place
 and i think the dart was a part of that
 spear shaft the boy is making ill match
  the pieces as soon as i get a chance   
  whoever killed the doctor had access to
 the house keep those m ad-shoes in mind
 and that bottle of venom

   bon dieu bautain exploded now
 you suspect the boy before the day is
 overyou will have the whole island under
 suspicion 

   such has been my ir tention from the
 very beginning    remember 

   bahl with extreme impatience the
 administrator pushed his chair back from
 the table and got to his feet why go
 on with the farce the guilty man is
 locked up i shall examine him today
 and enter a charge against him the
 courts at papeete can take care of the rest
 of the business

   he put on his hat and quit the veranda
 dexton grinned lighted a cigarette and
 followed him to the beach

   it looks he remarked to bautains
 back as if its a case of hail hail the
 gangs all here

 several groups were gathered on
 the sand dexton had seen movst of
 them before one of them a white man
 who wore a sun helmet and was dressed
 in white saluted bautain

   good morning administrator i hear
 that you have had some unpleasantness
 here

   oui oui doctor duane was killed
 last night we have apprehended the
 murderer i am about  o bring the body
 ashore for burial he said to dexton
 this is monsieur daley from your

united states monsieur daley is a pearl-
buyer

  daley was a compactly built man a
head shorter than dexton a square-faced
man with a mouthful of short strong
yellowish teeth

  he gave dexton a quick cold gray-
eyed survey

  havent i seen you some place be-
fore 

  on the road probably in the work-
gang dexton said carelessly im
working my way up theres nothing like
starting at the bottom    ive seen you
before too but never with pants on

daley tipped back his head and
laughed a booming laugh

  from sunup to sundown i seldom
wear more than a pair of swimming
trunks and a hat ill get into my uni-
form presently going out to the yawl 
bautain had moved off to impress sev-
eral natives into his service and now they
were launching canoes making ready to
go to the yawl and bring doctor duanes
body ashore

  ill let bautain handle that end of it
dexton said he wont need me out
there

  hell manage all right a good ad-
ministrator bautain    care to step up
to my shack and have a drink
delighted 

  they walked side by side

  as one american to another daley
said how are tricks

  they could be worse

  and it goes without saying that they
could be a lot better

  of course dexton admitted

  you can tell me to go jump in the surf
and ill understand daley said but
is there a difficulty

  you mean because i am a member of
the labor-party here 

  yes

  i landed full of the best of spirits but
without funds dexton explained there
seems to be a law covering such cases
if there is anything i can do-
thanks but im working it out dex-
ton grinned the murder of doctor
duane while it was tough on him is a
break for me bautain discovered i used
to do a little police reporting at home
for some unguessable reason he seems to
think that qualifies me to act as a de-
tective he has offered me a suspension
of sentence in exchange for the name of
doctor duanes murderer

  and you have named putnam 


the blue book magazine

  the clues we have turned up seem to
point toward putnam dexton told the
pearl-buyer putnams outrigger was
used last night putnam was away from
his house from nine oclock until about
midnight the murder was committed
during that time there are a number of
other clues i feel that i am not at liberty
to disclose them at the present time bau-
tain has put putnam under arrest but he
hasnt examined the man as yet

he pointed at a beached outrigger
close to the path they followed

  thats putnams canoe bautain iden-
tified it last night putnam took a great
deal of pains to disguise his footprints
he wore a pair of doctor duanes mud-
shoes ive never seen the things ap-
parently they are made something like
snowshoes    perhaps i can show you a
print if one still exists

  he walked over to the beached outrig-
ger found one of the oval prints in the
sand

  heres one he said and pointed it
out

  daley bent over hands on knees and
studied the mark his position drew up
snugly the seat of his white trousers
made his well-filled hip pockets bulge
dexter observed that the pearl buyer car-
ried a pipe and a tin of tobacco in one
pocket

when chan cast the hag over
the head of the unsuspecting
gaston dexton tackled the
guard about the legs

  interesting daley said straightening
up ive heard of mud-shoes but ive
never seen any either

   near daleys house a native shack
with a thatched roof a native lad ten or
eleven years old was digging in the earth
with a stick when he saw daley he
threw down the stick and trotted up to
him to show two copper centimes he had
in his hand

 daley laughed so you found them
eh  all right off to the store with you
now and spend them with devereux

  he explained to dexton when the boy
ran off toward the store

  its a game ive been playing with the
kid i hide a few coins and he digs for
them a treasur e-hunt you know he
gets a kick out of it and devereux is all
hot and bothered about where the boy is
getting the money he cant quite be-
lieve the lad is digging it up

  they went into the house the pearl
buyer produced a bottle of whisky and
two glasses

  say when he directed dexton


ten pieces of silver

  when dexton said when his glass
was half full my first drink on heeva
heres looking at you

 good hunting daley said an-
other

  dexton shook his head

  not now ive got to keep the wits to-
gether  im playing detective remember
daley laughed

  i wouldnt be surprised if youd al-
ready played the game he took the
pipe and tobacco-tin from his hip pocket
and filled and lighted his pipe im not
throwing any mud at putnam under-
stand but i have had the feeling that
there was something there something i
couldnt fathom

detween putnam and the doctor
 jj you mean

  yes you see i am here really be-
cause doctor duane asked me to meet
him here i met him iri papeete a couple
years ago he wrote me several months
back that he was planning another trip to
the islands he suggested if i met him
here he would show me something of
interest

  pearls 

  yes daley said thats about all
that does interest me

  the doctor had found some pearls 
i gathered that he had discovered a
bed he was forever poking about the
islands that idea did interest me very
much this group of islands has never
been any great shucks as a producer of
pearls i knew if the doctor had found a
bed it was an unfishe j one one no one
else ever had discovered such a find
usually means a rich harvest

 when you came here and met the
doctor didnt he give you some infor-
mation  dexton asked

  not a thing he was secretive if he
had any information he kept it under his
hat and putnam seemed to resent me
being on the spot

  so you have had your trip in vain

  i wont say that yettdaley said
maybe youll turn them up from among
some of putnams possessions if you do
i wish youd put a flea in bautains ear to
let me have a look at the things when
did you say he was going to put putnam
on the grill 

  i think he intends to do it sometime
today im going to talk him out of it if
i can

 why

  the psychological touch dexton ex-
plained putnams locked up in that

sheet-iron shack beyond bautains bunga-
low its hotter than a dutch oven in
there the man doesnt know what is
going on i figure that if hes left to stew
in his own juices for a time left very
much alone and in the dark as to what is
going on-well hell get jittery a jit-
tery man is likely to spill more than he
means to when he is finally yanked on the
carpet the inner pressure is relieved by
letting off a lot of talk its third-degree
business ive seen worked very effective-
ly at home

  daley nodded he took off his shirt

  if he spills any information about
where he hid the pearls let me know will
you    im going to get on the uniform
now and take a dip

  returning to bautains bungalow dex-
ton found the administrator writing an
official record of the case

  that chan lee who slept next to me
in the prison shack-hes doing time for
burglary isnt he  he asked bautain

  out nothing is safe when that
chinaman is loose he laughed a little
he stole the false teeth from gastons
mouth one night when gaston awakened
he believed he had swallowed the plates
he became ill and was in much pain
swell  dexton exclaimed his delight
i want you to release that china boy to
me

 diablel what do you want with
him

  i have a little job for him to do ill
be responsible for him dexton promised

  bautain shrugged all right he
agreed but if he steals anything youll
serve sentence as an accomplice

  ill take a chance im in a gambling
mood today

  we have a law against gambling here
too

  you have altogether too many laws
youve got yourself all gummed up with
them thank goodness im not in your
shoes    send for chan lee

the oriental soon came to the bunga-
low a slightly built bland-faced
yellow man who wore dirty pajama trou-
sers straw sandals on his feet a green rag
twisted turbanlike about his head

  while bautain watched after them a
disapproving frown on his round face
dexton took the chinese to the shade of a
clump of coco-palms a short distance
from the house there he gave chan a
cigarette and talked with him for a time

  sacre bautain fairly hissed when
dexton returned alone to the veranda i


the blue book magazine

dont know what devilment you have been
hatching but if it-

  if it misses fire blame me and not
chan dexton said calmly write in
your books old thing and dont worry
about us he stretched out comfortably
in the hammock when chan comes
back let me know

  he closed his eyes almost instantly
he slept he slept for an hour before
bautain booted the hammock where it
sagged the most and said

  the slant-eyed devil is back

  chan lee was squatting on the floor
near the door

  dexton sat up in the hammock

  get it he asked chan

  chan handed him a revolver a very
short-barreled nickeled revolver with
black rubber grips a vicious-looking gun

  a forty-five bulldog dexton said  a
very nagty weapon at close quarters

he broke open the gun and ejected the
cartridges into the palm of his left

hand

  have you a pair of pliers he asked
bautain and a pen-knife

  what now

  im going to unload these cartridges-
just in case

  bautain swore under his breath but he
went into the house where he found a pair
of pliers and a knife he brought them
to the veranda and threw them down on
the table

  with the tools dexton pulled the bul-
lets from the cartridges and he removed
the powder then he replaced the bullets
in the unloaded cases and inserted the
cartridges in the cylinder of the revolver
he handed the gun to chan lee

  put it back where you got it dont
get caught come back here when youve
done the job

  chan lee shuffled away

  dont bautain said when the ori-
ental was gone tell me whose gun that
was

  he picked up the pliers dexton had
used and flung them the length of the ve-
randa they struck against the screening
and bounced back

  if you and that slant-eyed heathen
live long enough youll probably build a
road clear around this island

  dexton chuckled and stretched out
again in the hammock

  i told you i was gambling today he
reminded the administrator its all in
a good cause-to erase the blot on the
record your record he lighted a ciga-

rette youll have to play along with me
a little part of your play is to leave
putnam alone today let him stew put
over your examination until tomorrow
tonnerre de dieu bautain growled
must i-

  exactly dexion said thunder in
your beard if you like but dont make
too much noise about it ive got to catch
up on a little sleep

  he slept until late in the afternoon
whenhe awakened he discovered chan
lee squatted-on the veranda and smoking
a cigarette to which he had helped him-
self from a package on the table bautain
was nowhere in sight

  do the job all right dexton asked
chan

  do him all lightee nobody see
  where is he

  gone boatee

  okay    you stick around where i
can find you after it gets dark weve
got another little job to do    havent
seen joseph about have you

  no see

  okay ill have a look around i
want to see what th at baker boy is up to
he found byron baker on the veranda
of putnams house the young man was
working on his notebook	

  been at that all day dexter asked
yes baker said there didnt seem
to be anything else for me to do

  he closed the notebook put down his
fountain pen in the precise row with the
other pen and the pencils

  you know mr dexton he said then
huskily im somewhat concerned
about what

  about myself i havent any money
and i am quite a distance from home the
doctor brought me here paid all my ex-
penses i-i dont know what to do

  just eat sleep and dont worry about
it for the time being dexton advised

t cant help worrying the young
 man confessed probably i shant
sleep too well because of that as for
eating-there isnt any food in the house
theres the store

i know but  havent any money
and i am getting quite hungry we didnt
bother to get much of a meal last night
last night dextons jaw dropped a
little havent you eaten since

  no sir

  kid im sorry-and ashamed of my-
self dexton said and meant it i had
my own belly full and never gave you a
thought not in that way
ten pieces of silver

  he put his hand in his trouser pocket
and jingled a few coin

  bautains advanced me a few francs
come on down to the store and ill stake
you to some crackers and cheese and a
drink thatll hold you until bautains
housekeeper puts on the hash tonight
youll stay there with us

  they went to the store where dexton
bought the materials for a substantial
lunch then he sent baker on to bau-
tains house

  tell them i sent you he directed the
boy

  he bought himself  bottle of beer and
sat down at a veranda table to drink it
he had just finished the bottle when
daley came in the man wore tan swim-
ming shorts and a white sun helmet he
ordered more beer and sat at the table
with dexton

  hows the big case going 

  ive a feeling its about to break
dexton replied the jpsychological treat-
ment is working putnam is quivering to
talk about tomorrow morning hell be
ready to spill all he knows

 hell confess you think

  hell either confess or give us some-
thing that will incriminate someone else
hf isnt the only suspect you know

  i didnt know daley said

  theres joseph the ex-takuna dex-
ton told the pearl-tuyer and then
theres that baker the lad doctor duane
brought here with him neither one is
exactly in the clear joseph apparently
has made himself scarce the boy is here
and worried  if putnam isnt the man
we want ill bet the rest of my sentence
against the finest pearl you can scare up
in these parts that he knows who the kill-
er is im going to get that information if
i have to sweat him dry to get it out of
him

   he finished his beer

  im playing everything ive got to
break this case im patting all my stakes
on one throw of the dice s to speak i
win or go back to the work-gang and i
think ill know by tomorrow perhaps
by tonight

dinner was served after sundown at
bautains house served at the table
on the veranda but this night cole
dexton was not one of the diners bau-
tain and baker ate without his company

  dexton crouched in a clump of pan-
danus near the sheet-iron shack in which
roger putnam was confined chan lee
squatted beside him they did not talk

neither did they smoke they listened
and watched-and waited

  chan lee expelled a short breath in a
soft hiss through the screen of leaves
dexton sighted the light of a swinging
lantern gaston came along the path
from the house his rifle slung across his
back in one hand he carried a bucket-
putnams dinner

  by the door of the shack gaston put
lantern and bucket on the ground while
he fumbled with the key to the padlock
which secured the door

  now dexton whispered

  he and chan lee moved swiftly and
silently forward in his hands chan car-
ried a burlap sack he ran slightly ahead
of dexton

  when chan cast the bag over the head
of the unsuspecting gaston and jerked it
about his shoulders dexton tackled the
guard about the legs and brought him to
the ground with a thud that produced
from gaston a grunt and then a curse

  get your hand over his mouth dex-
ton snapped

with cords ready he bound gas-
tons arms together at the wrists
his legs at the ankles

  into the shack with him  gag him
now throttle him if you have to but
dont let him yell

  with gastons keys dexton unlocked
putnams leg-shackle putnam was sit-
ting on his cot so far he hacj not ut-
tered a word

  youre passing up dinner tonight fel-
low dexton told him were spring-
ing you bautain is going to put on the
screws tomorrow youve got to get
away

  though he was now free of the leg-
shackle putnam made no move to leave
his cot

  but- he began in his nervously
jerky voice but i didnt-

  maybe you didnt but where were
you last night you were away from
the house between nine and midnight

  i went to call on a-a woman

  care to name her

  no

  okay its on your head youve got
to make yourself scarce to these parts for
a few days bautain is convinced you
killed the doctor you know what that
means under french law

  that im guilty putnam said and
ill have to prove myself innocent
right and a swell time youre going
to have proving that the cards are
stacked against you fellow youve got
to lam

 but where-

  the yawl is your best bet get to it
and put to sea if there is anything you
want from the house go grab it in a hur-
ry well meet you on the beach

  he shoved putnam through the door-
way of the shack

  run he commanded theres no
one at the house the kids with bautain
tonight run j 

  putnam ran

dexton waited until he was out of
sight then he said to chan

  all right we go after him if its
pearls hes after well have him cold
they trotted along on putnams trail
putnam ran to his house and went in 
a minute or so later a light came on in a
rear room he had lighted a lamp or a
lantern and he moved about with it

  then with the light--it was a lantern-
he came out of the house by way of the
rear door in his right hand he carried a
bar and he trotted toward the base of an
immense old breadfruit tree

  at the foot of the tree putnam set the
lantern on the ground he gave a furtive
look about and then with the bar he be-
gan to pry at a large thick slab of basalt
it was a heavy stone and putnam had
trouble moving it he used small stones
as fulcrums and he shifted them a number
of times finally he did lift the slab a
little he kicked a small stone under it
to hold it while he shifted bar and ful-
crum again

  for more than ten minutes the man
worked feverishly before he succeeded in
lifting the slab clear of its bed in the
earth then with the bar he worked the
big stone to one side until under it the
lantern-light disclosed a cavity

  putnam got down on his hands and
knees then and reached his right hand
into the hole he tried to drag some ob-
ject out but evidently he had not moved
the stone far enough to the side for again
he went to work with the bar and moved
the slab a few inches more

  then he dragged from the hole a metal
box

  tucking the box under his left arm
putnam snatched up the lantern and
trotted toward the bungalow he went
in through the rear doorway inside he
went to his own room

  hes pulling out the top drawer of the
bureau dexton whispered to chan lee
he recognized the dry squealing sound

that drawer made hes after his wallet
ill bet maybe his gun too

  in the house putnam pushed the bu-
reau drawer in pul led out others

  no good chan lee said

  no good dexton agreed bautain
has it

  the light moved from the room

  watch yourself now hes coming
out

  putnam came out by the front door
still carrying the lantern he trotted down
the veranda steps and toward the beach
he had the metal box under his left arm

  he trotted forward a dozen steps-and
a shot crumpled him

  he went sprawling forward the metal
box falling to bounce end over end on the
ground the lantern oddly enough
struck on its bottom and stood upright

  dexton made a headlong dash toward
the spot from where the shot had come
he had seen the flash

  grab that lantern  he yelled at chan
get that lantern

  chan ran up with the lantern near
the base of a young palm lay a rifle a
few feet from it was a small green tin

  gastons rifle 

  dexton grabbed i t up he snatched up
the green tin too that he shoved in his
trouser pocket

  come on i 

  chan lee racing at his side he ran to
the shack

  gaston lay bound and gagged as they
had left him

new day had come the sun was an
hour high in the coolc shack the
buxom barefoot cook was rattling pans

  on the veranda the short plump ad-
ministrator was pacing his agitation back
and forth his hands gesticulating

  mon dieu bautain said i should
sentence you to at least ten years

 how about twenty cole dexton
asked

  he sat at the table a dispatch box
stood open by the lamp the table top
was covered with newspaper-dippings

  we didnt slip entirely we have
proved that roger putnam and thomas
salisbury were both aliases for one and
the same person wanted in the u s on a
ten-year-old murder charge these clip-
pings tell the whole story    thats one
feather in your cap

  bah a dead feather and you shall
wear it it shall be on your head you
released him you assaulted a prison
guard broke open the prison-


  gaston had already unlocked and
opened the door dexton jpsisted upon
the correction so you can cross out
the breaking and entering charge i did
release putnam ill admit i slipped up
when i left the rifle with gaston i forgot
about it

  twenty years would be just punish-
ment

  okay twenty years then make up
your mind and calm down doesnt gas-
ton know who took the rifle from him
he had it slung over his back

  could he see bautain demanded
you left that sacre bag over his head

   who killed doctor duane thats
what i want to know

well you know putnam didnt do it
and you know he didnt have any pearls
pearls pouf that much for the
pearls there werent any

  baker says there were

  yes indeed baker said from the
hammock the doctor told me that
the last time he was here he discovered a
bed he took up one or two pearls when
we went back-it was about two weeks
ago-we found the bed had been raided
at first the doctor thought mr putnam
had done it but mr putnam most
strenuously denied it

  did they have an argument



baker swung his fist into daleys face
tripped him and flung him down da-
ley ripped the gun from his pocket
the blue book magazine

  yes a very heated one baker said
finally the doctor put on a helmet and
went down he was down over an hour
when he came up he apologized to mr
putnam for his suspicion he said he had
found something under the water some-
thing that identified to him the person
who had raided the bed

  what did he find 

  a knife

  whose was it 

  i dont know mr dexton

fiction  bautain swore pure fic-
tion  youre telling a story now to cover
your own tracks where were you last
night when putnam was shot and killed 
bakers face drained of color

i  i-i was walking along the beach
uahk oui walking along the beach
a most convenient place to walk at that
particular time but why were you
walking

  youll burst a blood-vessel dexton
warned bautain besides where did you
go after dinner  and where was joseph 
where has he been ever since the doc-
tor was knocked over theres some-
thing id like to know

the housekeeper came out to lay the
table for breakfast dexter swept
the clippings into the dispatch box and
tossed the box under the table

  lets skip it until after breakfast
they had no more than concluded the
meal when devereux the storekeeper
came to the bungalow with him he had
the native boy dexton had seen digging
for centimes near daleys shack the
lad was crying

  the french of devereux and bautain
was much too fast for dexton to follow
but he gathered that the boy had com-
mitted some misdemeanor devereux put
a handful of silver coins on the table
coins to which clung flakes and crumbs
of earth dexton counted them-ten five-
franc pieces

  what goes on  he asked bautain
  the administrator shrugged

  the boy just tried to buy out the
store he offered this money in payment
the question is where did he steal it
from the looks of it id say he dug it
up

  thats what he says a likely story 
i saw him dig up a couple centimes
yesterday near daleys shack dexton
said daleys been playing a game with
the kid he buried the money send for
daley and have him confirm that mon-
sieur missouri

  daley confirmed the story when he
came to the bunga low the pearl-buyer
had on a shirt and a pair of trousers

  but this money bautain gestured
toward the table surely you didnt bury
that mon dieu that is more than a
few centimes that is fifty francs

  daley shook his head

  i didnt plant that i dont know any-
thing about that pile but i do know this
-if thq kid says he dug it up then he dug
it up

  have hirrftake us to the spot dexton
insisted tell him we want to see the
hole

  the boy led the men to the beach and
then northward until he came to a palm
that had been snapped off ten feet or so
from the ground

  at the foot of the palm bole was a fresh-
ly dug hole earth heaped up about it

  ask the lad dexton suggested how
he happened to dig here

  i guess ive made him treasure-con-
scious daley said

  bautain questioned the boy

  he says the administrator translated
when the boy replied that he was hunt-
ing for treasure this morning he saw
that the earth by the palm here had been
disturbed he find the money monsieur
daley buries by looking for disturbed
earth

  the observing little devil  daley
chuckled ill fool him the next time

  bautain went on he dug with his
hands when he found the money he ran
to the store with it

dexton squatted by the hole about
eight inches deep which the boy had
clawed into the ground with his fingers
dexton began to dig

  this ground he said has been dis-
turbed deeper than the boy dug

  he dug with both hands he dug up a
coffee-tin and a glass-stoppered bottle

  thats it  baker cried excitedly
when he saw the bottle thats it-the
venom 

  and here dexton said pulling the
cover from the coffee-can and making the
contents of the tin rattle are the pearls

  by george  daley exclaimed bend-
ing forward to peer into the can they
are pearls and nice ones too

  he looked at bautain

  id like a chance at buying the lot i
mean of course if it is possible for you
to sell them to me id like to be per-
mitted to look them over and appraise
them


ten pieces of silver

  good heavens dexton exclaimed
handing the tin of pearls to bautain
havent you done that yet

  what dye mean  daley demanded

- i should think that by this time you
would have a name for each pearl

  for a moment the little group stood in
stunned silence then daley cursed and
stepped back his right hand swept
toward his hip pocket

  baker who stood beside the man
pivoted on his toes and swung his fist into
daleys face striking him squarely be-
tween the eyes then he lunged against
daley tripped him and flung him down

  daley ripped his gun from his trouser
pocket baker kicked it from his hand
then he dropped on daley put his knee
against daleys adams-apple put his
weight upon the knee he had the bottle
of snake venom in his hands

  you be good he advised daley or i
shall pour some of this into your eyes
   you were fooling around down here
last night i know because i saw you

late that day baker and dexton were
a on their knees on the veranda of
bautains house rolling a pair of dice
baker had a couple of the ten five-franc
pieces in a hand dexter had the others
on the floor in front of him

  bautain climbed the steps opened the
door then stopped and stood looking at
the two

  now what he demanded

  dexton palmed the dice

  did daley confess he asked

  oui he met the doctor a couple
years ago at papeete he bought two
pearls from the doctor who told him he
had found a bed here when the doctor
came back this year daley followed him
to heeva he tried to get the doctor to
fish the bed but the eoctor knowing it
would be illegal refused so daley did
some scouting he talked with natives
here and on other islands who had helped
the doctor at various times finally
daley located the bed and rafded it he
did lose a knife under the water the one
the doctor found and recognized the
doctor threatened to expose daley as a
pearl pirate if daley did not turn over the
pearls so daley killed him to silence
him you had that all figured out he
killed putnam because he feared putnam
knew a thing or two

  then he said accusingly

  you knew all the time and you said
nothing to me about it 

  dexton shrugged

  i couldnt prove a thing i was look-
ing for a forty-five-caliber gun because
that brass end on the dart was made from
a forty-five case the morning after the
killing i was showing daley a print of
that mud-shoe in the sand when he bent
over to look at it i saw the bulge of the
gun in his pocket i got chan lee to
pinch it its a forty-five as you know
why didnt you tell me bautain de-
manded

  youd have slapped him in the brig-
and you couldnt prove a thing against
him i couldnt not even after i found a
tin of his tobacco beside gastons rifle
where he dropped it when he shot put-
nam i knew it was his tobacco devereux
doesnt sell that kind

  dieu wasnt that proof

  no not the kind i wanted what i
wanted him to do was go after putnam
i tried to arrange that thats why i un-
loaded daleys gun i didnt want an-
other killing done-and then i never gave
gastons rifle a thought

  he shook his head

  its queer the way things work out
sometimes he said there i was figur-
ing hard on a scheme to make daley ex-
pose himself and actually he himself
put that machinery under motion before
he killed the doctor teaching that kid
to hunt treasure did it the ten pieces of
silver the kid dug was the business
oui bautain agreed he sat in the
hammock and i keep my promise to
you mon ami also i shall see to it that
monsieur baker is returned to the united
states he can live with you until a
schooner comes you will occupy put-
nams bungalow

ell need a houseboy dexton
said how about chan lee 
its all right with me so long as you all
keep within the law    where did you
get those dice

  we found them in daleys things we
are just warming them up

  gambling  bautain said severely
then that is against the law here
but were not gambling gambling is
a game of chance

  bleu isnt rolling dice a game of
chance

  no

  why isnt it you make a bet on the
roll and there is a chance to win

  oh yeah  dexton grinned he tossed
out a five-franc piece cover that big
boy and ill show you how utterly wrong
you are

ill
        axus the hair badger was
hungry and he craved excite-
ment so he hoisted his mus-
cular bulk out of the slanting
burrow and prepared to sally forth again
on what for weeks had been a fruitless
quest-the search for fresh food where
there was none

  a doglike shiver began at his leathery
snout and ran the length of his bristly
body effectually shaking the den-dust
out of his wiry coat then his usually
dreamy eyes roved critically over the im-
mediate surroundings to make sure there
were no lurking dangers in near-by weed
patches

  he grunted and puffed peevishly as he
began the hopeless search he must have
something to eat soon or the coming of
winter would number him among the un-
fit not an ounce of fat did he-carry
now unusually early hot weather had
driven him into asstivation weeks ahead
of time but the first flat rock he over-
turned exposed not one snail grub nor
beetle not even a moist spot where in-
sects ordinarily hovered and it was the
same with a dozen other rocks and favor-
ite insect retreats which he scrutinized
patiently and deliberately even the cus-
tomary dust-colored grasshoppers were
absent now

  he swung his black orbs farther afield
to find that prospect just as uninviting
apparently there was nothing edible in
the whole region except perhaps a few
elusive sandswifts-bony lizards with
snaky flickering tongues and fireproof
toes who were of the few ground-runners
able to turn a square corner and come to
a full stop at top speed without skidding
or upsetting these swift little reptiles
could run without apparent discomfort
over sand hot enough to scorch the tough
soles of a badger and they deposited

their eggs about the size of peas and
shaped like hen eggs in the same burn-
ing sand but taxus had little liking for
eating lizards

  he came now tc a place from which he
could view a wold of sunken prairie
miles of dry grass in tall spires with
white waving pennants in huge bouquets
of dead trailing streamers in scattered
huddles of shorter salt grass with parched
stems and dead foliage a far-stretching
solitude of drouth-cursed slopes fell away
to flats as arid as the uplands	

  from the edge of a small jutting table
rock taxus gazed intently out across the
waste a stiff breeze pasting his coarse
hair flat to his wide chest and pointed
face for several minutes he stood mo-
tionless he was reluctant to leave the
district where he was born and had lived
for nearly twenty years he knew every
foot of it and like most other creatures
he preferred to stay in familiar surround-
ings perhaps drouths were for the pur-
pose of causing wild life to change en-
vironments and thus prevent stagnation
however that may be the badger must
move out if no rain came soon

  forty days and forty nights huge
thunder-heads had hung listlessly in a sky
of faded blue steadily presaging a rain
which just as stubbornly refused to ma-
terialize and that vast basin which is
cheyenne bottom rapidly became a cal-
dron of spinning whirlwinds and shim-
mering heat mirages all the prairie
vegetation was succumbing to the arid-
ity even that hardy native the sandhill
lily rattled dry swords like the bleached
ribs of a buffalo skeleton

  on the basins rim braced against the
breeze taxus resembled an incongruous
idol of some pagan cult and somehow the
blacker bands around his eyes gave him

bottoms

a vivid drama of the
wilderness war at our
doorstep

by david baxter

more the aspect of a meek old clown than
of the bold brigand he really was   

  gazing down the long slopes he was
surprised to see another badger hurrying
along a narrow path that wound through
the grass thicket-not a stringy specimen
like himself but a vividly banded animal
in full fur of a definitely blackish cast-
looking neither right nor left and in a
moment passing around a hummock out
of sight then in a few moments a lanky
beast hove in sight-a much larger brute
with long flopping ears touching the
ground as he loped along the same trail
the fugitive badger had taken taxus
crouched instinctively sensing the need
though not the reason for caution when
the stranger passed abreast of him a long-
drawn howl echoed over the hillsides
the hair badger bared his teeth in a
soundless snarl and drew farther back
from the edge

  of course he could not know that this
was the worst of all enemies of wild life
on the ground a lone trail-hound who
hunted just for the sake of the kill but
the mere fact that the other badger had
fled so precipitately was sufficient tax-
us squatted low and taut  

again the deep bawl sounded below
i and to the right and taxus saw
the hound plunge forward and clamp his
fangs over the neck of that other badger
as the latter tried ineffectually to dig into
a rocky slope where he had been over-
taken in less than a minute came the
soft crushing sound of severed vertebrae
and almost directly the hapless fugitive
was stone dead

  as flat as a door-mat taxus sprawled
upon the ledge seeking to escape atten-

  tion through absolute immobility while
  the dog worried the lifeless carcass nor
  did the watcher move until the hound
  had slouched off across the bottoms with
  the peculiar slinking stride of a panther

    as day advanced and there seemed no
  further danger from the trail-hound
  taxus arose to survey again the terrain
  he took no more than a dozen rolling
  steps when with startling abruptness a
  shrill buzzing long and vehement yet
  carrying an undertone of plaintive terror
  came down from high overhead taxus
  gazed quickly aloft

     so swiftly the eye could scarcely fol-
  low dodging hither and yon a singing lo-
  cust hurtled through the air and right
  behind dodging when the locust dodged
  circling when the locust circled in and
  out up down as though the two were
  joined by an invisible thread a giant
  blue wasp pressed in close pursuit inch
  by inch the wasp drew up and in an
  amazing spurt of speed struck the fear-
  crazed fugitive squarely in the middle of
  the back tumbling both of them to the
  earth at the badgers feet they were
  quivering in death as taxus raked them
  gingerly around with one long forenail
  before turning to his own affairs

    trundling down the slope he now re-
  sembled a towheaded urchin who could
  not keep his unruly hair combed and
  parted he lived the identical life-cycle
  of all western badgers but some trap-
  pers would claim that his kind was a
  separate species for he had no soft un-
  derfur-no underclothes so to speak in-
  deed the hair badger derives his trade
  name from the fact that he has only one
  coat of sparse bristles therefore his pelt
  is virtually worthless on the hide market


  his thirty pounds of mature bone and
sinew swung low on wide-set legs gave
to the hair badger an appearance of un-
couth awkwardness quite deceptive-for
he could be as active as a bobcat upon
occasion also as vicious and as wise
long-legged killers such as coyotes
found him difficult none of these
treacherous assassins had ever been able
to corner him where he could not scoop
out a shallow depression in which to curl
his haunches while he brought all four
cutters into action

  the last rays of the sun were tinting
the white thunder-heads with golden
cream while the sky deepened to the pur-
ple of approaching night and still the
hair badgers food-search was unreward-
ed an ominous quiet creeping slowly
over the bottoms had rendered the at-
mosphere responsive to the slightest
sounds through it came the distinct
cawing of that black pirate the carrion
crow flapping wearily and warily more
than a mile away his raucous voice
held a note of jeering derision

  the hair badger listened a few seconds
as with measured laborious strokes the
ebony murderer of young birds winged
up that rightfully named deception
creek which joined blood creek to end
waterless in the basin then taxus
shuffled on toward the high country

  scrambling to the highest ridge he
saw what had not been visible from be-
low  a prodigious black cloud on the far
horizon as he eyed it it enlarged fear-
fully with awe-inspiring rapidity it
seeped over the whole northern segment

of the heavens like an immense ink-
blot it spread wider and higher until the
very earth was overshadowed then
without further warning a long wriggling
chain of blue-tinted lightning split the
black from its uppermost edge to the
dusky hills beyond

  the hair badger cringed painfully be-
fore the cannonade of thunder which in-
stantly followed the terrifying thrust of
lightning in common with all prairie
denizens he had never become accus-
tomed to the blinding interplay nor had
he overcome the deadly fear of it in-
stead of taking to the open countryside
he galloped madly back down the slopes
his long claws hampered him sadly
once they caught in a loop of pepper-
grass throwing him headlong and once
he collided with a projecting lump of
earth and was thrown out of his course

then came the rain  a prelim-
inary scattering of huge drops made
duck-tracks in the alkali dust other
drops jarred the withered pads of a
prickly pear while straight crystal spears
were soon stabbing the scarlet sumac
berries and piercing sporadic growths of
dead bunchgrass as tall as a man the
pelting sting of the drops drove the dis-
tracted badger to greater speed

  a rising wind mingled and added a
sullen roar to the thunder the slashing
lightning became an almost incessant
glare the very landscape faded into
the fury of the storm the air was a veri-
table lake turned upside down pools
formed instantly to run over and slither


down every plane around the bottoms
rivulets raced down every erosion fur-
row every slough and draw fed a
swirling mass into the flood deception
creek reversed its reputation to become
indeed a master of deceit and blood
creek ran overfull of muddy water in
the end the cloudburst changed the gi-
gantic dry bowl into an inland sea of
twenty-five thousand acres of clay-gray
water-an unheard-of occurrence in the
annals of man

  taxus wallowed through the deluge
like a small bark crossing the bar in a
hurricane only blind instinct enabled
him to locate his den and had it not
been situated on a side hill where the
drainage was good he would have been
forced to spend the night outside pos-
sibly he would have drowned although
he could swim as well as a beaver

sometime afterward when he once
more hoisted himself out of the hole
a silver cycle-moon lay flat on its back
on the eastern rim of the bottoms old-
timers called it a new moon with the old
moon in its lap indians said the two up-
pointing horns denoted wet weather the
red man might as well hang bows and
arrttws on the horns because it was go-
ing to rain and there could be no hunting

  the hair badger spatted down toward
the new-born lake where a shore breeze
told of food that was plentiful for news
of the new watering-place had carried
far those who had deserted during the
protracted dry spell were returning in
force bringing with them many stran-
ers who had always lived outside
crawlers runners flyers hoppers had all
responded to the call es man responds to
the urge of a gold-rush

  uttering a tiny squeak of fear some-
thing shot from under the very feet of
the badger bounding away over the re-
juvenated ragweeds clearing ten feet at
every jump its long hindlegs and slen-
der tufted tail indicated a kangaroo rat
a complex little fellow who possessed the
twittering voice of a bird and the reck-
less leaping proclivities of a frog

  taxus scorned pursuit no need of
chasing rats that tried to fly when there
were plenty of ground-squirrels

  he scented a fresh squirrel-hole and
was soon regaling his ravenous appetite
upon its stripe-coated stub-tailed owner
it was his first meal for days and before
he was appeased he had unholed a total
of six squirrels small wonder early farm-
ers in kansas asserted that a badger

bored thousands of post-holes of which
none could be fitted into a fence line

  the hair badger hunted to the brink
of the lake consuming en route several
beetles and katydids a sand mouse and
a trapdoor spider it was while he was
busy digging that a faint but clear and
deep baying sounded from the crestline
so much noise did he make ripping
through the tough sod that he was to-
tally unaware that the deadly menace of
the night trails was again abroad in
blissful ignorance he moved on around
the lake surprising a prairie-dog owl
that lonely night-flyer who consorts so
freely with rattlesnakes and who is the
sole member of the owl family content to
reside on the treeless plains

 the double-horned moon mounted
steadily in a star-sprinkled sky casting
pale radiance farther out across the lake
whitening the water until it appeared to
stand above the shore in snowy promi-
nence a heavy roll on the surface failed
to detract from the peace and quiet of
the sleeping seagulls who had discovered
the transformed bottoms and drifted in
for a nights rest after a strenuous day
of chasing grasshoppers now nearly a
thousand were riding the swells as lightly
as bits of thistle floss apparently moving
with the breeze but in reality remaining
as stationary as an anchored boat-
for gulls can swim automatically while
asleep

  a scattering of slaty mudhens mingled
with the throng seeking companionship
they would fraternize just as readily with
canadian geese or whooping cranes

where the waters slapped and hissed
on a flat beach the badger paused
to sample the air currents some mys-
tic warning endeavored to penetrate his
food-gorged senses for a full minute he
stood as rigid as a mounted specimen
high overhead a wide v of sandhill
cranes circled slowly for a safe landing
in the moonlight the liquid queries of
their aged leader fell like bugle notes
to be broken suddenly by a weird cry
that quavered over the waves in agonized
ironical laughter-a loon had found the
new lake and was already enjoying it in
his queer fashion a ring-neck killdeer
who seemed never to sleep ducked his
round head and ran in a flash along the
brink uttering a succession of shrill in-
tolerant complaints

  taxus resisted an impulse to pursue as
the queer little bird cut loose another
cackle of piercing defiance and flickered
the blue book magazine

out of sight in the gloom a rod or two
from the water were a number of odd
chimney-like structures each walled me-
ticulously with mudballs about the size
of marbles and each standing approx-
imately six inches above the ground with
a one-inch hole down the center-the
mud towers of a crawfish village which
is often found in swampy places where
there is no surface water a deft sweep
of one forefoot brought one crumbling
down and taxus soon unearthed its an-
gry inhabitant and each of several more
holes furnished another of the furiously
resisting creatures which the hair badger
consumed ere he resumed his wanderings
across the flats

above the incessant drone of billions
 of insects there was that stupen-
dous hush of illimitable spaces a gigan-
tic quiet composed of innumerable tiny
noises grass blades rubbing and weed
stems tapping leaves fluttering growing
plants upthrusting and unfolding water
gurgling and wavelets hissing singly al-
most inaudible but combined to a vol-
ume of deafening quantity once the ear
separated it from the rest

  the hair badger had much hunting to
do he waddled along the beach sniffing
the wind suspiciously the trail-hound
had apparently left the neighborhood but
there seemed an admixture of smells sift-
ing down the slopes and when he ar-
rived at the foot of a bare swale spread-
ing out fanlike to the water he stopped
to listen intently a moment then a
childlike cry of anguish and hopeless ter-
ror rang out again and again it sounded
rapidly drawing nearer as the hair
badger faced in that direction a jackrab-
bit galloped out of the hedge of weeds
and passed within a few yards of his won-
dering eyes staggering as it ran its voice
thinning pitifully taxus could plainly
see the cause of its distress-a dark
shape resembling the shadow of a flying
squirrel clinging to the runners flank
much as a cheyenne indian rode his war
pony during an attack on an early-day
wagon train

  with all four feet outstretched the sin-
ister shadow gouged deep in the rabbits
neck and taxus knew that the villain
in velvet the prairie weasel had also ar-
rived it must have covered many a
weary mile to be present so soon and so
soon living up to its reputation as con-
scienceless cutthroat a vindictive blood-
sucking vampire it was literally riding
the jackrabbit to death   

  the hair badger plodded on around the
lake investigating indian sage tickle-
grass broom sedge and russian thistle
jungles just before sun-up he came to
a black opening in a low embankment
here he decided to camp for the rest of
the night and here he eventually stayed
for several nights as usual he entered
backward and was soon sleeping on his
well-filled stomach long claws folded
lattice-wise over his face

  after several foggy days the sun
boiled red and large over the eastern side
of the basin lending a hazy smoky effect
to the bottoms as of the recent presence
of a thousand pawnee council fires it
was the beginning of indian summer
and the badger toddled forth for a last
hunt before cold weather closed the doors
of too many larders an overgrown yel-
low grasshopper was the first to catch his
attention then four or five sable hearth-
crickets who had thought themselves se-
curely hidden under the roots of a wild
rosebush and next a clan of praying man-
tis who cocked their triangular heads
in futile bravery following this he
hoed out a tapering bread-root munching
it with great relish as his dreamy eyes
wandered around in search of another
appetizer-a pint of seeds shaken down
from a tall gum weed

  on account of their ventriloquial qual-
ity he could not locate exactly the yelp-
ing signals of a coyote but when another
of the gray sneakers answered from the
crest of cheyenne hill he knew they were
merely exchanging greetings with no in-
tention of trying o corner him he ac-
cepted fully of the bounty provided by
the season indeed he became an in-
veterate vegetarian an eater of roots
fruits and seeds clusters of wild grape
lured him as did hippaws prickly pears
ground-apples grass-nuts buffalo peas
mushrooms and sheep sorrel literally
walking in fat he was as was every crea-
ture upon which he later preyed they
were easy prey when so fat as to be care-
less

  the young of prairie chickens quaijs
meadowlarks snakes moles and other
ground dwellers all furnished acceptable
fare after the days of eating vegetables
thus was the badger assured of a warm
bed for winter in one of his deepest hi-
bernaculums

one thing marred the serenity the
trail-hound began hunting along the
lake every night he found the trails hot
on the frosty air sometimes his eager

cheyenne bottoms

bawling sounded so close that the badger
would crouch in the tensest anticipation
many a rabbit opossum and ground bird
gave its life to this heartless killer man-
trained in the art of murder he was no
doubt the only one in the whole region
whom taxus had to fear

  one chilly night when the badger was
hurrying back to a den he had arranged
for winter he ran afoul of an alien rac-
coon the like of whom he had never
seen in the bottom pure black a
shadow of the ordinary coon he sat ob-
stinately in front of the door his pink
eyes glowing with the unwinking stare
of live embers he snarled truculently
when taxus tried to detour and again
when he tried the other side but if he
thought the badger would retire he was
in error self-locking jaws open wide
black lips curled taxus muscled forward
the coon snarled his ill humor and the
badger emitted a defiant hiss which arose
quickly to a thin high treble like the
whistle of a pop-corn wagon the coarse
hair on his back springing erect

they came together cursing and vili-
fying as savagely as a pair of wildcats
an for a minute there was little to
choose between them one big ball of
fur and claws they rolled and squirmed
the badger growling dog-fashion the coon
spitting like a tomcat while the hairy
one clinched and wrestled the ring-tail
bounced and held on with monkey claws
however it was more a battle of spite-
neither really tried to kill the other
neither had any intention of eating the
other nor was this la tter ever the case
except when adult ate young

  the din of the battle was terrific as
over and over sidewise like a pair of
rough-and-tumble wrestlers end over end
like a pair of trained acrobats the evenly
matched combatants flopped and writhed
then abruptly the dynamic animosity
ceased altogether-both participants re-
laxed tq lie embraced listening

  the long low howl of the hound echoed
through the night with sinister insistence

not unmusical it was in spite of its
fear-inspiring tones the deep baritone
of the trail-hound tolled again closer and
the listeners immediately disengaged
hatred for each other entirely forgotten
the black coon trotted nonchalantly off
into the thickets the hair badger backed
into the disputed den without even look-
ing to see if he would hit the door square-
ly here he sighed in relief as he heard
the hounds call sounding fainter and far-
ther up on the ridge

  down along the waterfront the voices
of the lake were a babel of confused ar-
ticulations somehow strangely detached
the thousand of seagulls was now ten
thousand a great gathering of teals and
butterballs chorused a weird scale while
the sonorous quacking of mallards can-
vasbacks and other ducks of weightier
species blared at untimed intervals hell-
divers there were too in numbers diving
for what they could not yet hope to find
on the new bed of the lake a few peli-
cans a small flock of sandhill cranes and
another of green herons stilted in deeper
water even the curlews came-another
almost extinct species seven of them
sailed in exactly a yard apart one behind
the other wings stroking in the perfect
unison of well-trained boatmen

  an overland immigration of astonish-
ing proportions was also arriving and as
every eden has its evils many types of
turtles blundered into the district the
diamondbacks striped shells leather-
backs and even the humbler stinkers a
miniature tank corps of armored destroy-
ers from the walnut and arkansas rivers
as far as twelve miles from the new lake
the ruthless brown mink were also there

     illustrated by
     lee townsend
they came in a small mob as they often
traveled for safety and better hunting
facilities and a few days later taxus
met yet another immigrant train a
mother skunk and her brood of nine half-
grown youngsters mincing along daintily
tails at half-mast fur slicked back in
shining elegance

  it began to look as if the bottoms would
eventually be overpopulated taxus saw
opossums of many shades pure black
brown cream cinnamon white and gray
the ancient bottoms were indeed becom-
ing a paradise for all manner of wild life
cattails were pointing stubby brown fin-
gers skyward bulrushes polished and
symmetrical waved their beaded tassels
to and fro three-cornered slough grasses
thrust their bodkins up through the shal-
lows never since the day nearly a cen-
tury before when satank the cruelest
most relentless of cheyenne chieftains
had established a village in the basin had
there been such a change in any region
when day waned the far-flung sheet of
water became a scene of intense activity
when day broke the winged regiments
formed one after another to rise and be
whisked into the south with a sturdy
norther pounding them on the back

  as taxus trudged one night over a flat
still sodden from the wind tides there
was no note of foreboding in the chill at-
mosphere yet he cast about furtively
from time to time the icy-crisp muck
underfoot was not to his liking but there
was an occasional helgramite lucky bug
or other compensation to be found in the
little pools along the way so he worked
methodically across to a long incline tip-
ping gently up to the skyline whereon
grew a mixed garden of wild mustard
muletail sunflowers burdocks and other
rough dryland plants

near the edge of this jungle he
stopped to shake the cold mud from
his feet a chill cross-wind brought a
scent to his dilated nostrils strange and
new it was yet wet and fishy as the smell
of crawdads or clams and directly an
odd agitation began farther out in the
weeds moving gradually toward him
some awkward creature too bulky for
the winding rabbit-runs was forcing its
way through

  retreating backward a few steps tax-
us waited until the thing finally broke out
into the open

  an almost involuntary tensing of
shoulder- and neck-muscles prepared the
badger for battle the things he did not

know he did not fear then he stared
in astonishment at the black apparition
that blundered out of the thicket never
before had he viewed such a repulsive
monster such an embodiment of malice
he recognized that it was a turtle-but
the size of it was beyond his experience
while the demoniacal glare in its snaky
eyes was appalling and its outthrust
snout was disgustingly ugly

with rrfsterful oarlike tread it tore
loose from the entangling weeds and
marched toward him but the hair badg-
er stubbornly held his place clutching
the muck returning evil glare for evil
glare the long scaly neck shot ag-
gressively forward snapping horridly
with beaked jaws taxus answered its
malevolent hissing savagely

  the lumbering turtle was as large as
an inverted dishpan and had rows of
horny protuberances all over its armored
back although it advanced in a manner
brooking no interference taxus stood
his ground baring his teeth only hissing
the louder

  this loggerhead alligator was an un-
known quantity it would have been no
disgrace to run away for the logger
was one of the most dastardly fish- and
bird-murderers to be found in the lower
kingdom nothing a hair badger could
do would ever equal the destructive pro-
pensities of a loggerhead even when the
logger was no larger than a quarter of a
dollar he was a fierce and fearless little
killer who made life miserable for small
fish and other aquatic life

  tapering horn-clad tail lashing side-
wise hard eyes gittering the alligator
turtle charged as though to crush taxus
underfoot for a mere badger to inter-
cept this powerful creature was the depth
of folly in truth a man may well feel
a qualm of fear when a loggerhead is de-
termined to attain a given objective at
such times they seem to go insane-and
woe unto any who has the temerity to
stand in the path

  unwittingly taxus faced the greatest
danger of his life here was ah enemy
in an impenetrable coat of mail who
could rend and tear with fearful power
but who was invulnerable to teeth and
talons

  luckily the turtles first stroke swift
and vicious barely grazed the badgers
sneering muzzle the hooked beak cut
and seared drew a jet of blood but failed
to secure an anchorage the hair badger
leaped sidewise grunting his surprise


not yet convinced like a wary boxer
he circled his mountainous foe seeking
an opening for one of his straight-in bites
but his teeth struck and grated on some-
thing hard as rock this enraged him
beyond control beyond better judgment
leaping over the massive pile as the
turtle pivoted with swiftness unbeliev-
able in one so cumbersome he fastened
one of his lockjaw holds on a horny hind
foot striving furiousty to sever that jerk-
ing member but he found it the same
as trying to bite a dried hedge limb and
the strength of that pistoning leg was ir-
resistible  it snatched him back and forth
with relentless force

  suddenly a bell-toned voice sounded
along the upper slopes twice thrice
drawing perceptibly nearer placing the
badger between two burnings the hunt-
ing hound-dog was approaching with
steady strides sniffing carefully for a
fresh trail weaving noiselessly through
the weed patch ami so intent was he
upon smelling out the many converging
runways that he came to the scene quite
unaware of its dreacful import even
then his big solemn eyes told him it was
only a silly badger wallowing around a
blck earthy hummock badgers were
easy for him to kill he knew how to
do it he crouched edged stealthily
ahead hoping to creep close enough for
one short leap evidently this badger
was more of a fool than were the rest of
his kind

  meanwhile the ugly beak had swung
back to fasten upon one of the badgers
hind feet like a pair of wire nippers
snipping into the tendons rendering the
old mammal helpless for a moment
then he flew into a veritable hurricane of
clawing slashing and useless in-fighting
he might as well have been fighting a
tree stump for all it gained him the
loggerhead had walked twelve miles
across country from ihe arkansas river
and did not propose to be turned back
now in fact he would rattfer head into
death than turn aside

slowly and relentlessly he began to
drag his frantic victim toward the
water once under the surface it would
be an easy matter to drown him and end
the affair he had often drowned full-
grown geese and ducks step by step
he heaved and hauled until the slime
began to rise around him while taxus
centered his efforts  trying to prevent
being dragged to a watery grave he
hooked his claws into the slough-grass

 roots and held on but he succeeded only
 in plowing miniature furrows in the mud
 behind him in spite of all he could do
 inch by inch the animated tractor was
 pulling him into the shallows

   it had become a weird silent trial of
 endurance-yet every living creature in
 a radius of a hundred yards knew that
 some awful tragedy was happening
 many were the terrified eyes staring from
 the fringe of vegetation the boggy flats
 became a zone of silent fear a bullbat
 wheeled drunkenly a great horned owl
 that cruel shark of the night airways -
 skimmed low on hushed wings but did
 not dare to stoop

then the hound took a hand he
knew no more of alligator turtles than
did taxus but he sensed that he had no
time to spare three bounds and his
slavering jaws closed upon the elongated
neck of the saurian closed and relaxed
again

   like a flash the turtle released his own
 grip and sank his beak deep in the
 hounds shoulder so rapid and savage
 was the stroke the dog could not antici-
 pate it he yowled aloud in pain seek-
 ing only to free himself but the tena-
 cious nightmare clung and bit until the
 horny hook found the shoulder-bone
 the whole lakeside fairly rang with pite-
 ous howls the hound-dog was getting a
 touch of his own cruelty did he but es-
 cape it is practically certain he would be
 cured of lone hunting

   taxus dragged his maimed foot up the
incline to a safe den where he spent the
winter sleeping and healing his wounds
his enemy the trail-hound had uninten-
tionally proved to be a friend in need
and indeed

proposition pete mcgill sat on
the bed staring at his hat with a
sour look on his face for sooner
or later he was going to put it on
and then go out and ride down four floors
in the elevator walk three blocks climb
the stairs to the second floor of murlays
billiard and recreation club and there
probably hanging around the snooker
game find fish-eye yager and inform
fish-eye that he did not have any fifteen
hundred dollars

 that would vex fish-eye which was
unfortunate for fish-eye was large and
very hard both inside and out he wasnt
tricky or underhanded at all in fact he
was strictly on the up-and-up but he was
awfully firm about money-matters and

he made his book out at reever citys
parkside when they were running there
for they dont have pari-mutuels yet at
parkside and when they werent he
made it on otker trac ks down at murlays
b  r c though most of his bets were
small four-bits to ten bucks in general
he did all right keeping his book care-
fully in balance and never trying to
handicap races himself

  but today when fish-eye wanted a
hundred on flatside to win he just
couldnt turn it dewn even though at
fifteen-to-one the bet threw his book top-
heavy out of balance for horses were
not only props livelihood-they were his
inner being and he knew flatside could
not even run fourth except by a fluke

could nearly always be counted on to col-
lect his debts the few instances in
which he had failed were commemorated
by split lips cauliflowered ears and oddly
shaped noses which could be seen around
town any time you cared to look

never again prop vowed solemnly
would he let his book get out of balance

  thereupon mice twice got left flat-
footed at the post gigger-do and count
march tangled badly at the stretch turn
and captain percy running easily and a
cinch to win broke stride just after he
made his bid and finished poorly appar-
ently a touch lame flatside won and
a bad day otherwise including three cus-

what an idea
breathed cue-ball

 bankroll gone he could have got a stake
 somewhere-from squire hinkle if no
 one else among other things the squire
 ran a few horses himself including cap-
 tain percy and while he was strictly an
 individual to leave alone when possible
 he was ever eager where there was a pros-
 pect of thirty per cent a month and
 would have been a sure touch ordinarily
 but even the squire wouldnt stake a
 bookie who in one afternoon had lost fif-
 teen hundred he didnt have

tomers who hit parlays wiped out his
bank-roll and left him with exactly seven
bucks to give fish-eye on account-a sum
which fish-eye would consider inade-
quate

  and not only had hi s greed made him
an appointment with mayhem but it had
blighted his future with merely his

still sitting there being sad about
things was not going to change them
any so finally prop sighed and started for
the dresser to get his hat as he did so
there was a knock on the door

all right then fish-eye he said re-
signedly come on in but honest i
was just on my way out to-

it was not fish-eye it was cue-ball
cohen gorge lundborg and creep weav-
er they entered silently with their
hands in their coat pockets and cue-ball
said take it easy and keep quiet prop
-clean him gorge

 you know i dont carry nothing

 rhe kidnaping snatch-

 shaking sojourn in the cus-
 tody of cue-ball and creep
 his hazardous encounters
 with fish-eye squire hin-
 kle and that sardonic assas-
 sin lips livermore
you leave my twenty-five
hundred at the desk for
scotty berg prop satd

  creep had the door open a crack and
was peering into the hall

  say prop inquired what is this
anyhow 

  a snatch cue-ball stated briefly
and we dont want no trouble uner-
stan 

  prop looked puzzled no fooling
no fooling cue-ball assured him
boys prop stated i dont get it
but youve come to the right man lets
go even fish-eye couldnt expect him
to show up if he was busy being snatched
of course this was only postponing
things but that was better than nothing
anything even fish-eye tomorrow was
better than fish-eye today

  halls okay creep announced

  prop locked the door behind him and
went along the hall with creep and gorge
on either side of him and cue-ball lead-
ing they passed five doors and cue-ball
opened the sixth one and they all went in
that was quick wasnt it  prop said
pretty nice cue-ball admitted no-
body to see or nothin

  i got to hand it to you prop said
 kinda liked it cue-ball said mod-
estly i read about it some place one
time im always readin somethin he
added course yunerstantheys noth-
in personal in this prop strictly busi-
ness an well try to make you comftable
while youre with us

  sure sure propsaid you guys
are okay i know that

  just set down over there cue-ball
said indicating the desk by the window
an well get the note wrote up he
produced a pencil and paper from jiis
pocket jus tell him how it is an itll
be tweny-fi gran an to put a ad in the
journal to daisy-

  who  prop asked my uncle adel-
bert 

  sure cue-ball replied who else
well prop said nobody only-
well uncle adelbert just dont seem to
like me very much and hes mighty
tight you know im afraid he aint lia-
ble to go for this fellas

  hes your own flesh and blood aint
he cue-ball asked

  yeah but you see-

  thats good enough for me cue-ball
said you just write the note

  okay prop said i just thought
you oughta know

  there was a chance they might get sore
when they found cut they couldnt show
a profit on him and creep and gorge
particularly were sort of unpredictable
when they got sore but at least now they
couldnt say he hadnt played fair

prop finished ihe note telling uncle
adelbert to acknowledge its receipt by
a personal in the journal addressed to
daisy and that further instructions
would then follow and not to go to the
police or anything else it might cost his
devoted nephew his life
  cue-ball approved the note and creep
left to slip it under the door of uncle
adelberts office they werent using the
mails cue-ball explained to prop we
aint gettin no feds in you bet he said

  there was no danger of anyone else get-
ting the note because uncle adelbert had
no employees his business being what he
called trading he bought things and
sold them-anything from a fruitstand to
a business block and his profit was gen-
erally in proportion to the size of the deal
most of his deals were big

  creep would go on home after deliver-
ing the note and the other three now
went to bed they had a two-room suite
with two beds in the bedroom cue-ball
and prop slept in one gorge in the other
cue-ball handcuffed prop to himself

  not that i dont trust you he ex-
plained -only when you got a impor-
tant deal like this you got to watch them
details

  prop said sure he understood

when there was no answer to the
note next day prop said his uncle
adelbert was probably out of town  and
when creep called his house from a pay-
phone the housekeeper confirmed this
guess

  just waiting with nothing to do was
pretty dull gorge did better than the
rest of them gorge short for gorgeous
was seven feet high and though during
his brief ring career he had never been
knocked down his real ly singular charac-
teristic was that he is probably the only
man in fistic history woo leads exclusive-
ly with his ears which were now of an
unusual shape and hue and not much
good to listen with gorge got himself a
potted plant from the dime store and set
it in the window and watered it a good
deal and watched it interestedly the rest
of the time and seemed pretty well satis-
fied  but it didnt grow fast enough to
suit the others

  creep was the silent typeand always
moved wearily except when there was
shooting he was different then but
most of the time he was sitting or lying
down or leaning against something he
drew things once in a while-pictures
and sort of designs and some of them
werent bad either

  cue-ball was relatively speaking the
brains of the trio and though true to his
word he did read some it was evident he
wasnt cut out for a real bookworm

  creep and gorge ate out and brought
sandwiches and things for the other two

  prop asked creep to bring him a rac-
ing form when he went out that first
evening and of course when he got back
they all got to talking about horses and
picking them

  it turned out the next day that both
creep and cue-ball had picked three win-
ners and cue-ball said if they just had
some dough they could kill some time
with the ponies prop making book of
course

  in fac he said i mean look prop
-i mean it aint as if we didnt have no
prospects when well be plenty fat soon
as your uncle gets back if you wanted
to make book an take our markers-
tell you the truth prop said im
short myself right now but ill make you
a proposition i know youre all right an
you know me well just make it who-
ever loses pays off out o the first cash
he gets hold of course he added i
dont care only it would kinda pass the
time wouldnt it

  prop wasnt much worried about going
in the red for if he couldnt out-handicap
these three he would go on an oat diet
and start running in claiming races him-
self as it turned out at the end of three
days he was into them for about eight
hundred after that though the betting
continued with the trio increasing their
bets it didnt get their full attention

  for on the morning of the fourth day
the journal carried a message for daisy

  daisy-knew you were worthless but
  not that you were stupid enough to think
  id fall for anything so obvious a mcg

  whats the matter with him cue-
ball asked angrily

  i guess he thinks its just a gag im
tryin to fleece him with prop said
hes got a kind of suspicious nature
he added sadly

  well cue-ball said grimly well
fix that we just got to write him a bet-
ter note thats all

after some revision another note
 was drafted which cue-ball was
positive would convince uncle adelbert
his nephew was a goner if twenty-five
thousand was not swiftly forthcoming
prop was as interested as anyone now for
if they did collect he would be into them
on the races far enough by that time to
pay off fish-eye and his own troubles
would be over but he wasnt nearly as
optimistic

  the last time he had tried to dig any
cash out of his uncle was to buy a pure
  well taps said the easiest
  thing is to conk him here an
  then take him down to his room
  an finish him up wit a blade

sweetheart of a three-year-old filly which
as he explained to uncle adelbert had
been handled wrong and could be turned
into something really fancy uncle adel-
bert had read him a lecture on the evils
of horse-racing tried to sell him a green-
house and flower-shop worth twice the
money finally even offered to let him run
it rent-free just pay the taxes if he would
quit his worthless ways-and two days
later bought the horse himself on the
basis of what prop had told him about
her handling he had won two purses with
her and then sold her for twice what he
had paid and had at the same time gone
slightly horse-nutty

  so prop was disappointed but not sur-
prised when this appeared two days later

daisy-am i laughing

  that really seared them why cue-
ball said indignantly that old buzzard
aint got the heart of a louse and him
your own blood-uncle

gorge having thought hard all morn-
ing now suggested they might cut an ear
off prop and send that to uncle adel-
bert  but prop said all ears looked afike
to uncle a and gorge went back to
looking at his plant discouraged cue-
ball however inspired by that and mo-
mentarily heartened by what seemed the
first practical idea yet said they could
cut off a finger though and send it-
for uncle adelber wouldnt think prop
would cut off his own finger and that
would identify him

  but when prop pointed out that it
wouldnt-because his fingerprints had
never been taken they all lapsed into
gloom again except gorge who looked
up at prop admiringly

  gee gorge said not ever

  it just dont seem fair cue-ball said
bitterly not makin nothin on a per-
fect snatch is bad enough but to lose
dough on the deal- he ran a hand
over his thinning hair and let it drop de-
jectedly sometimes it just looks like
they aint no use tryin to get ahead
its sure tough prop agreed somber-
ly because this spoiled his own chance to
pay fish-eye too but dont let it get
you down he consoled cue-ball it
aint your fault different guys is good
at different things is all an you all just
aint cut out for this kind o business
what about goat de griff  cue-ball
said he started out here nothin but



   this time they all worked fired to a
 white heat of creation and everybody
 gave all he had

   dont forget about does he want you
to endure inhuman oriental torture and
hideous suffering and wind up a gory
mewchilated corpsie cue-ball cautioned
culling a bit of useful data from his hours
with the masters

  prop put in those angles and some
more of his own and in the end it was a
powerful eloquent epistle which they all
knew they could never equal again it
drew two mornings later this reply

daisy-tsk tsk how harrowing

   by noon things were at a standstill
 clearly uncle adelbert simply was not
 open to conviction by letter and to see
 him personally if it did convince him
 prop was kidnaped would also betray
 the identity of at least one of his captors
 and that wouldnt do
a cheap gun an a little snatchin on the
side in a small way and hes went on up
aint he first chi an now hes in new
york with just about the number one
guy in the country thats all

  thats what i mean prop said
goat he was cut out for it see  he was
prompt an efficient an his prices was
right an he was on the job all the time

  jus take this job frinstance prop
elaborated goat woulda found out first
it wasnt no good an never bothered with
it see he just well he just had a tal-
ent that way you might say you guys
oughta be in somethin where you could
use your talents see what i mean  like
cue-ball oughta be in some kind o game
where he could use his head on keepin
books and cuttin costs an stuff like that
an creep he oughta be in somethin
where he could use his art see an gorge
oughta be raisin somethin-like vegeta-
bles or flowers-thats what i mean

kay okay cue-ball said but all
that dont make no differnce now
what we gotta figure now is whatre we
gonna do 

  i think we oughta knock him off
gorge said its his fault he aint got
no business havin a uncle like that
anyhow creep put in suppose he
was to turn us in

  now boys prop said hastily-for
when creep had ideas like that they
might come to something you couldnt
tell about creep-you know i wouldnt
do a thing like that anyhow if i did it
wouldnt matter couldnt anybody prove
anything besides he hurried on it
wouldnt be honest to knock a guy off
when you owe him dough gorge you
know that

  i guess not gorge admitted gloom-
ily after a little he muttered some-
times i get tired bein honest

  cue-ball sighed again i sure hate
to have it all come to-

  wait a minute  prop said suddenly
with a light in his eye wait a minute 
he looked around at the three slowly
men he announced impressively i
got a proposition is absolutely the pret-
tiest thing you ever see all you need is
five gs cause you dont owe me but
two and a half an i know where you can
get a greenhouse an flower-shop for not
moren fiteen hunnerd an thatd give
you a g capital an youd be a cinch
with gorge to raise the stuff an cue-ball
to hanle the business an creep to make
the floral designs an stuff like that

  gee it sounds pretty nice at that
cue-ball admitted only-

  my uncle has the joint prop went
on an i know i can get it for you for
fiteen hunnerd its worth twice that
only its down on third street an the
guys hes had in there dont do any good
in that neighborhood an the taxes are
too high an he cant get em cut down
but cue-ball your brother-in-law in the
assessors office could get that fixed for

you an you guys know all the boys down
that way and theyd be tickled to give
you their business an you know how
the boys are when theys a funeral an all
the funerals they have an weddins an
parties an stuff itd be a gold mine
but that dont do no good cue-ball
wailed as the beauty of the idea grew on
him when we aint got no five gs an
cant get it

but you can prop said its a
cinch he paused a moment for effect
and then said succinctly peddle me
cue-ball blinked and sat up gorge
frowned trying to think

  how cue-ball said who to
nothin to it prop said you go to
somebody likely like say itchy iboze or
clutch kelso or horrid albert an act
dumb see you snatched me only now
you got cold feet and dont know how to
go on with it but i got a uncle thatll pay
plenty all it needs is the right kind o
man to handle the details an youll sell
me for five gs it cant miss

cheeses  cue-ball breathed what
a idea  then he sobered only how
about you prop  will you be okay 
dont worry about me prop said
them guys is all friends of mine an


the blue book magazine

when it turns out they cant do nothing
theyll just take it for a joke and itll be
okay see  cause they all got plenty of
cash at the moment and theyll never
miss it

  creep cue-ball said lets go you
stay with prop gorge dont let that
pansy grow too fast he added cheerily
an well sell it when we open up

  it aint no pansy gorge said its
a lilium martagon but they were gone
that means turks-cap lily he ex-
plained to prop

  but prop didnt hear him for he was
lost in happy contemplation of the amaz-
ing resource of the mcgill brain if this
worked and he was confident it would
the boys would have a great set-up-that
greenhouse was made to order for them-
and he himself would not only be able to
pay off fish-eye but would have a stake
besides and all from a situation that
had looked worse than hopeless in fact
it was such an absolutely terrific idea that
he didnt see how even he had thought of
it just sheer inspiration he guessed

it was about six oclock when cue-ball
and creep got back they just came
in and sat down

  howd you make out prop asked
eagerly okay

  well cue-ball said we peddled
you

  which one prop said when cue-
ball didnt go on itchy i figgered he
was the best bet

  no cue-ball said uncomfortably

it wasnt itchy

  well prop said cheerfully it dont
matter any of them three is okay they
all got a sense of humor

  tell you the truth prop cue-ball
said reluctantly for one reason another
didnt none of them want to monkey with
it but you see it was such a fine idea we
shopped aroun a little more an finally
we find a guy goes for it all right an-
an- he stopped and passed a hand
over his head again

  who prop said uneasily who is
he

  well prop cue-ball said its squire
hinkle

  there was a silence broken only by a
low whistle of sympathy from gorge for
slow as he was on the uptake even gorge
got the grim implications of that an-
nouncement

  prop just swallowed and turned pale

  for the fact that rufus fenimore hin-
kle-usually known as squire-had a



paunch with a gold watch-chain across it
a tiny goatee nd smooth ways could by
no means hide from anyone who knew
him at all well that he was a distinctly
grisly gent any way you took him he
was ever on the alert for instance for an
effective dope for horses which the stew-
ards could not detect and his connection
with racing expressed only his more jolly
and sportsmanlike side was merely a
hobby really he would just as happy
put you asjay as not if it might be profit-
able and even if it wouldnt if he was
irritated he had in fact been the man
who gave goat degriff most of his stern-
er business before the goat made good
and went up to the big time and he had
a lad working for him now named lips
livermore whom a lot of the boys pre-
dicted would go even farther than goat
had

  the others were silent too avoiding
each others eyes and it was a long time
before prop found his voice for he was
recalling his earlier predicament and
thinking of it longingly sweet gentle
fish-eye thoughtful considerate fish-
eye 

  cue-ball he said finally gee cue-
ball that was a awful kind of unfriendly
thing to do looks like

  cue-ball squirmed well i know he
said guiltily i guess it was prop
cheese i- but you see he explained
weakly it was juss so pretty we hated to
let it go to waste an i guess we jus didnt
stop to think an now-well you see how
it is we didnt mean no harm only-
well- his voice trailed off lamely

  for not mean in any harm prop
said you sure turned in a pretty card
he ran a hand distractedly through his
hair i guess they cant nothin be done
about it now though he said hollowly
for the only thing wrong with that state-
ment was that it was so awfully true

he would have tried gladly eagerly
anything that offered a chance of
release from this situation no matter how
risky but there wasnt anything an at-
tempt at escape would be merely fruitless
and painful for both gorge and creep
were sitting watchfully close to him now
and even gorge realized that not deliv-
ering to the squire merchandise you had
agreed to deliver tc him was a very silly
thing to do for the same reason it would
be useless to try to get them to call it off
particularly when that would also involve
a loss of five granc they were sympa-
thetic all right but not that sympathetic
who loses it

  maybe itll be all right cue-ball of-
fered encouragingly you cant tell he
said it may not be so bad but he
didnt sound very convinced

  yeah prop said sourly maybe
then he sighed look do me a favor
anyhow ill give you a envelope for
scotty berg an you put my tweny-five
hunnerd in it an leave it at the desk for
him no use me havin it here with
squire knowinabout it

  they consented eagerly as though glad
of a chance to do prop a last service and
prop wrote his note to scotty berg who
was house dick there at the hotel and
could be trusted he told scotty if he
didnt show up sooner or later to give fif-
teen hundred to fish-eye and keep the
rest for his trouble he guessed there
was no use trying to pul in a plea for help
or anything for cue-ball was reading
over his shoulder

  after that there was nothing to do but
wait

the squire arrived at seven-thirty alt
gracious and gushing the way he was
lips was with him the squire shook
hands all around and brought out a bottle
and wouldnt talk business until everyone
hadhad a drink he always did things
that way genial and expansive

  prop being the merchandise had no
reason to hurry but the vendors got their
drinks down in record time and the
squire then took the key to the room
gave cue-ball five thousand in medium-
sized bills and wished them a courteous
good-night giving prep a last fond and
apologetic look the trio faded out

  remember you leave my twenty-five
hundred at the desk for scotty berg
prop said to cue-ball on the qt

  the squire sipped hi drink contented-
ly well proposition my boy he said
heartily its good to see you looking so
hale i trust nothing will happen to upset
you no reason it should just a few days
for negotiations to come to rms-well
have you out of here in no time  expect
-lips my lad he directed politely
just hand mr mcgill some of that pa-
per you have and a pencil will you  he
wants to write a note

  prop had said little up till now and for
a moment longer he jus t sat there looking
at the half-finished drink in his hand
the idea of being in the squires or lips
custody while they went through all this
again gave him the ereeps and anyhow
it wasnt going to help things to prolong
it whereas if he came out with the situa-

  tion right now the squire might get mad
  but not too mad if prop was lucky he
  would still be in circulation next week

     he finished off his drink at a gulp and
  set it down

    theys no use writin any notes he
  said them guys have had me up here
  ten days an couldnt even get carfare
  out o uncle adelbert

    the squire raised his eyebrows what
  was that he asked softly perhaps
  youd better elaborate my boy

    so prop told him the history of the
  thing quoting the notes as well as he
  could remember them and showing him
  the personals with which uncle adelbert
  had replied im afraid they kind o
  tricked you he ended sympathetically
  its too bad

     yes the squire agreed it is rather
  too bad he had listened quietly and
  calmly and his voice was still soft and
  smooth as he spoke now but that didnt
  make it sound any better to prop when
  he heard what he said

    they tricked me prop he asked
  gently you arent trying to suggest
  surely that one of those dolts or all three
  together could have conceived this
  scheme of salvage its so obvious my
  boy that yours is the brain behind it that
  any other conclusion is ludicrous and
  so- he paused spreading the fingers
  of his right hand and gazing thoughtfully
  at their superb manicure

    i-i think ill have another drink
  prop said unsteadily as he stood at the
  dresser and poured it he saw sweat stand-
  ing up on the back of his hands and he
  could feel it cool and clammy on his brow

    lips the squire now said blandly
  id be glad to have your suggestions
  about the best way to handle this well
  want it quiet and unobtrusive naturally
  squire- prop began but he found
  he couldnt go on and besides the squire
  was paying no attention to him he got
  back to his chair and wilted into it feel-
  ing mighty empty it wasnt that this
  was anything he hadnt expected but it
  just came up so prompt and abrupt

  lips emaciated and pasty-yellow did
  j not reply until he was coming up to
  stand beside prop with an automatic in
  his hand just in case

     well he said then the loose flabby
  features from which he took his name
  flopping a few times before sound came
  from between them as they always did
  i guess the easiest thing is conk him a
  time or so here light an then take him
  
down to his room an finish him up wit a
blade

  the squire nodded pensively as a
matter of fact lips he said generously
that isnt bad at all no one saw us en-
ter no one need see us leave its quite
good lips really

  prop found his voice it craked a bit
but he found it squire he said they
aint no use in that honest they aint
you know im not chump enough to talk
an even if i did they couldnt anything
be proved pu-pu-putting me away he
finished wont make you nothing
financially no the squire admitted
reasonably but i believe in indulging
ones emotions you see thats why im
always equable i dont thwart myself
and i do hate to be bilked why i expect
ill get at least four thousand dollars
worth of satisfaction out of it prop that
leaves only a trifling loss you see no
i think-

i got a little dough myself prop
said tweny-five hunnerd if that-
no the squire said regretfully i
dont like to take a business loss im
afraid that-

  later prop didnt know why he said it
he had no plan maybe the urgency of
the situation simply popped it out of him
anyhow he said it

  how would you like to unload cap-
tain percy

  the squire regarded him carefully for
a full minute why he asked should
you think i might want to dispose of the
captain 

  well prop fumbled desperately i
dont know i just thought-way he fin-
ished last time an-i dont know-i just
thought he mightve pulled a tendon and
not be no good any more i heard some
talk that way

  hes quite sound the squire said
quite that was a shoe merely a shoe
still-if the price were right- have
you anything in mind 

  prop was still stalling still in the dark
what would you call right he asked
oh say fifteen thousand

never did prop ever know where the
idea came from when it did it just
seemed to kind of keep one jump ahead of
him while they talked

  i guess you wouldnt take maybe-fif-
teen hunnerd  he asked

  the squire considered then  do you
know where i could get it  cash 

  squire prop said i got a proposi-
tion  youre out five gs cause you cant

cash me for a dime your horse is worth
maybe a g an a half thats six an a
half did i get seven an a half for him
youd be in a grand right course he
admitted terminatin me might be more
fun but wouldnt the other be more-
well lastin you might say

  the squire when you got down to busi-
ness did not fiddle away time with idle
chatter

  can you do it  was all he said
uncle adelbert prop said has went
sort o horse-nutty here of late i think
i can do it id have to use the phone but
if it dont work he wont know where i
was callin from or that you had any con-
nection with it if i turn up missin so it
cant hurt anything to try lips can stan
right beside me while i talk jus to be
sure i dont make no slips

  the squire gazed at the tip of his shiny
shoe which he tapped with the point of
his gold-headed cane he looked up
call him he said

prop dialed the number the house-
keeper answered and said mr mc-
gill was at home prop put the mouth-
piece of the desk phone to his chest and
listened closely at the receiver when he
heard footsteps sounding he began talk-
ing softly

  all right all r ght that doesnt mat-
ter i tell you-

  in the receiver he heard uncle adel-
berts voice say hello he didnt re-
ply but raised his voice and kept the
mouthpiece against his chest

  okay i know the nag is worth fifteen
thousand but if you gotta have cash you
gotta have it an i dont know what the
old buzzardll come up to i take what-
ever i can get over seventy-five hunnerd
or im hanging up an thats final   all
right then pipe down hes cornin
prop fell silent giving the squire a
meaning look and listening after a little
he heard feet stamp the floor a time or so
and then uncle adelberts voice again
hello

  uncle adelbert     this is peter
uncle adelbert    no forget about that
other    well it didnt cost anything to
try    no    no i just heard about
something pretty n ice only i cant handle
it an i thought you  well its a
horse    hes worth anyhow fifteen
thousand only the guy owns him thinks
maybe hes pulled a tendon an hes gotta
have cash right away-hes just gotta
an hes gonna sell him tonight an it jus
looked like you might pick up a bargain
cause i know you always got cash handy
an- well maybe low as leven thou-
sand if you hold out    no but ill have
him up in my room to meet you if you
wanta come down  no you better take
a cab uncle adelbert    all right well
be waiting

  prop hung up and looked at the squire
know what he was gonna do he asked
he was gonna come on the street-car

uncle adelbert asked a lot of ques-
tions and wanted to know what
prop was getting out of jjj prop said
nothing very innocently and the
squire came down to eleven thbusand
but uncle adelbert still seemed mighty
dubious and finally said well all the cash
he could get together on such short notice
was seventy-five hundred and if they
wanted to deal for that all right but he
wasnt very anxious one way or the other

  so the squire hemmed and hawed about
the right amount and then finally took it
and made out the bill-of-sale and uncle
adelbert counted him out the money try-
ing to short-change him fifty but the

did yon lcnow tlie
squired a sold you
that horse for fifteen
hundred prop asked

squire caught it and lightly called his at-
tention to it and then the squire and lips
went on out

uncle adelbert looked at prop smugly

huh   he said thought youd flim-
flam me eh  even beat you at your own
game i know a thing or two nephew

  did you know the squired a sold
you that horse for fifteen hundred  prop
asked maliciously

 uh-wha-wha-what uncle adel-
bert yelped then he laughed youre
just trying to fret me that horse has
pulled no tendon

  no prop said but the squire thinks
he has an hed of sold him for fifteen
hunnerd an he might just as well have
a pulled tendon far as youre concerned
too less you got the right man trainin
him

  uncle adelbert licked his lips as if
they had vinegar on them whats-
wrong with him  he asked

  hes stricly a two-miler prop said
trained right try to make him run at
em early like in a mile or mile an a
eighth like las time an hes stiff yet an
dont like it an acts lame hes a phony
but give him two miles an he can make
a bid in the backstretch second time and
outrun anything in the country an love
it hed be a cinch bettern malibar
actually he is worth ten grand easy
-trained right he added
the blue book magazine

  how-how do you know uncle
adelbert asked

  only way you ever know anything like
that prop said briefly i seen it before
horse name of loose lucy at arlington
six years ago

  uncle adelbert was obviously thinking
hard

  i dont suppose you would-uh-be
interested in training him he suggested
presently

  no prop said i dont like you
much to start with if you wanta know
an i wouldnt wanta bother with jus one
horse anyhow

  well peter uncle adelbert said
youve rather surprised me this evening
youre cannier than i im planning on
building up a stable peter say ten or
fifteen horses if youd be interested in
managing-for a percentage of the prof-
its naturally he added hastily say
ten per cent

  prop snorted make it a choice of
three hunnerd a month or fifty per cent
he said an we might trade

   well all right then said uncle adel-
bert sadly having been prepared to go as
high as sixty-five

  by the way prop said then you
know that greenhouse you tried to foist
off on me

  yes said uncle adelbert warily

the lights looked cheerful and the
noise of traffic sounded friendly and
it was nice to see people just walking
around on the street free and easy the
click of the balls sounded friendly too as
he neared the top of the steps at murlays
b  r c and even fish-eye over by the
snooker game looked benign to prop

  fish-eye prop said here is that
fifteen cs i owe you im sorry it took so
long only i been busy bein kind of
snatched the last week or so an i couldnt
get aroun you know how it is

  oh fish-eye said understandingly
his face softening to the texture of gran-
ite well of course thats differnt
then he added politely everthing come
out all right 

  i guess i cant complain prop said
only- he paused a moment and a
faintly worried look crossed his face
fish-eye he said id be glad to buy a
drink if you aint busy you see he ex-
plained im pretty good at figgers or
anyhow i always was- again the
faintly worried look only maybe this
is differnt or something i-id sort o
like to go over it with somebody fish-

eye never went about repeating things
which had been told him in confidence

  they repaired to the basement bar
down by the bowling-alleys

co you see prop said during the
kj third highball indicating the figures
on the envelope they had finally resorted
to the squire puts in five gs an his
horse is worth a g and a half to him  but
he gets seven and a half out of it so thats
a g profit there then cue-ball creep
an gorge gef the five gs from him an
besides that a set-up worth anyhow three
gs for one and a half so thats six and a
half profit or seven an a half altogether
so far then uncle adelbert he gets a
horse for seven and a half thats worth
anyhow ten gs with me trainin him so
that makes ten altogether an then he
sells this greenhouse for one and a half
which he woulda took five cs for i bet
so that makes eleven gs an then i
come out okay an pay you a g an a
half that im clear on so you wind up
theres twelve and a half gs been made
all around-and what i dont get fish-
eye is this who loses it 

  thats a cinch fish-eye said after a
moment you say the horse is worth a
g and a half one time and ten gs the
next time well theres eight and a half
then the greenhouse you call three gs
one time and half a g the next time so
that makes eleven gs see then the
g and a half you pay me-well you owe
me that before it all ever starts so you
cant count that in for profit so that
makes the other g and a half they
didnt anybody really lose nothin cause
they all got good value for their dough
even the squire account of he wouldnt
ever of knew how to handle captain
percy but you givin things differnt
values differnt times is how it comes out
to look uneven see-when really it aint
do you get it 

  prop was frowning pretty hard but
finally he nodded

  well he said i guess so i guess
thats it all right only wait a minute
fish-eye he said suddenly maybe
that takes care of the twelve and a half
gs all right but-he reached into his
pocket-where did that come from

  and he laid on the table the cool thou-
sand in cash which he had left after pay-
ing off fish-eye

  fish-eye gazed at the money nervously
for a minute and then looked up for a
waiter we better get some more
drinks he said were gonna need em

the
submarines
treasure

  by s andrew wood

     who wrote those well-remembered blue book
     novels comrades of chaos and red terror

the back of erich schumanns
car where it stood coyly half-
hidden among the bushes of
the common was just visible to
janet feversham and she hesitated now
whether to go toward it or to walk on

  nosey parkerl jzn murmured to
herself with a touch of distaste its no
busifiess of yours who he has with him
unless- and the thought brought her
up short on the soft turf with her heart
quickening -unless it chances to be
kate if it is ill wring his neck

  tall and lissome she stood a moment
her hands thrust deep in the pockets of
her blue slacks frowni ng she looked a
firm strong and personable young wom-
an the sun streaked a long shadow
from her feet and there was no sound
in the warm silence save the murmur
of the sea at the foot of the cliffs and
the drone of naval planes far out at sea
in those hot august evenings in the last
week of peace the world itself seemed
to the imaginative listener to be holding
its breath

  slowly jan approached th car she
had no premonition of tragedy what-
ever even when the faint throb of the
running engine reached her ears all
she knew was that if her young sister
kate was in that car with erich schu-
mann she intended to step inside with-
out a word and drive them both home
to twelvetrees farm-though erich no
doubt would only give his nervous im-
pudent grin   she tapped on the closed
window before opening the door some-
thing acrid and choking caught at her
throat and made her gasp as she did so

wiping across her nostrils and her con-
sciousness like a whiplash gasoline
fumes

  kate kate darling

  time jan had been told stood still
at such moments if so she was tuned-in
differently-for time flashed past on wild
wings    they were there in the back
seat kates soft dead-weight toppled in-
to jans arms as she flung open the
other door-and she lifted the girl out
onto the grass the heart was beating
the breath came in fluttering gasps kate
whimpered and became very sick her
golden curls awry kate at any rate
was not badly hurt

jan ran back and switched off the en-
gine at the dashboard erich she
called-huskily because the fumes
made her own brain spin round he sat
slumped his blond head hanging
wedged somehow too heavy to move
jan feversham stared at him felt the
wrist that hung so limply and then
moved slowly away from the open door
there was nothing to be done there
jan oh jan hold me

  kneeling there jan put her arms
about her sister and held her while her
brain tried to stay cool the plane
squadron had long ago droned away
far out at sea the siren of a destroyer
whooped faintly a late bee hummed
what happened kate

  the small mouth shook still artificial-
ly red in a dreary white face kate was
eighteen but at that moment looked a
haggard thirty mechanically she was
already fumbling with her compact


the blue book magazine

  erich and i decided to die together
oh dont laugh jan it was all crazy
 know but-well wed nearly emptied
a big flask of brandy between us and
everything was so hopeless we loved
each other and there was erichs wife-
jan caught her breath so you re-
membered her

  yes one cant forget camilla i
wasnt-wasnt keen on all this but
erich-he kind of hypnotized me hes
german neurotic you know scotland
yard was watching him ready to intern
him and he couldnt stand it he might
have killed me if id refused i meant
to stop the engine as soon as he lost his
senses but i hadnt the strength-

  jan came to her feet her look trav-
eled toward the car then over the flam-
ing gorse bushes to the deserted road in
the distance

  hes dead she said with all the
clear brutality she could muster because
that way through kates keen sense of
self-preservation she could steady her
sister    no sit down its pretty
terrible but weve got to think things
over

  she did not watch the effect on kate
night was creeping in from the sea it
seemed to jan that night was creeping
over the whole world but she could
think coolly she could still hate dead
erich schumann who within a month
of taking the old manor house had
haunted twelvetrees farm where the
two daughters of the late tom fever-
sham lived and worked the land and
just managed to keep out of the bank-
ruptcy court im glad i hit him over
the face with that stick thought jan
though he only glowered like an in-
sulted prussian officer first me and
then kate but i didnt guess it was
anything like this

  the survivor of a suicide-pact could
be charged with murder fantastic but
true she could see kate drooping in
the dock carried out half-fainting to
prison she could see the newspapers

omebody saw you leave with him
in the car of course jan hazarded
no he picked me up camillas
in london getting ready to go a sea-
cruise on some yacht anyhow she
never suspected she thought-i think
she thought it was you who attracted
him erich gave her that impression
you see though shes ghastly jealous she
knew you would only laugh at him oh
im a swine jan what shall i do

  but the stiffness of terror was dying
away from kate she kept her back to
the car and watched her sister jan
smiled at her reassuringly it was a
queer time to think of deathbed-prom-
ises-or perhaps it wasnt she had prom-
ised to look after heedless headstrong
kate  and this was the way she
had done it

  listen you must walk home i know
its a good four miles but that doesnt
matter itll be dark in half an hour
take the bridle-path by nightingale
wood oh you poor little brandy-swig-
ging idiot kate but ill see to it all
and follow on dcnt say a word to any-
body now get going

  more than anything she wanted kate
to fling herself intc her arms much lat-
er jan feversham thought it was some
intuition that they would never see each
other again which came like one of those
nightmares that are half-horrible half-
comic in the growing dusk but kate
was already running steadying her pace
to a walk vanishing

with her jaw set jan went to the
car odd to think how certain sure
she was that erich schumann was dead
why had he done it was there a streak
of insanity in all germans as some peo-
ple said he was young and good-look-
ing and his wife camilla was beautiful
and very well off though not natural-
ized he had been in england for many
years

  get going muttered jan this time
to herself

  her plan had the simplicity of melo-
drama it was to drive the car across the
common to the cliff-edge where a grass-
road ran and cars often picnicked held
on the slope by their brakes the fall
was some three hundred feet and the
tide was in she was agile enough to
jump out after releasing the brake with-
out being taken over herself it wtas just
a case of steady nerves and waiting a
few minutes till the evening mist began
to thicken

  there might be something belonging
to kate still in the car when the tide
went dowm a scarf or some article could
easily be found among the wreckage
erich might have left a message for his
wife he hated her and he was full of
malice

  jans calmness was entirely artificial
if she let it go for one moment she
would find herself running away as kate
had done she knew instead she found
the submarines treasure

herself inside the car detaching some-
thing that was pinned firmly to the leath-
er padding of one of the front seats and
averting her glance from erichs body
it was a closed envelope superscribed
to be opened by my wife please

 jan ripped it open she was not
afraid of the dead mart as she did so be-
cause she could only picture him as one
who had wantonly used his power upon
kate in order to hurt his wife he was a
part of a strange neurotic brutality
which seemed to have overtaken the
world in general and one race of people
in particular

    i thought i would forestall you ca-
  milla i forgive you for trying to poison
  me you never thought i guessed did
  you if the police chance to open this
  first it will be nasty for you otherwise
  you will be in time to smash that phial
  of aconitine in your dressing-table
  drawer i dont care which as you
  know i was always a gambler it is
  kate i love i am taking her with me

  i always hated you camilla goodby

  a shudder ran through jan all er-
ichs lies of course to injure his wife
after he was dead she was glad to save
camilla that much pain she felt slight-
ly sick as she tore the note into pieces
headachy too and the mist that was
creeping round the car had a red tinge
to her sight there were no gasoline
fumes now but she recollected dimly
that the carbon-monox de part was odor-
less it still lay about the car with a
movement of alarm she tried to lever
herself from the seat her limbs seemed
useless her brain swimming with sleepi-
ness she slipped out as far as the run-
ning-board but could get no farther

from one of the saloon windows of
the diesel-engined yacht brantane
where she rode gracefully in the harbor
craig allenby watched the squadron of
naval planes fly jarringly overhead and
disappear down the sea-horizon he
helped himself to a drink from the sil-
ver tantalus glanced at the clock in the
bulkhead and shrugged the line of his
jaw was strong enough but his smile
was rather more cynical and tired than
a young mans had any right to be

 dont worry allenby the guests
will all be here when we weigh anchor
at midnight a voice said by his side

  jethro cobb always entered anywhere
like a quiet child who wandered in
small chiseled and suave he stood hard-

ly any higher than his secretarys broad
shoulders and moved with a limp and
yet he dominated the saloon as he domi-
nated any room he entered with that
lean eagle-like face stamped with dead
passions and worn like a mask-wheth-
er with a good or an evil aura it was im-
possible to say

  if they arent theyll never start on
their pleasure trip theyre putting a
boom across the harbor tomorrow said
allenby ive a hunch theres going to
be war

  possibly agreed jethro cobb pour-
ing out a thimbleful of sherry and choos-
ing a cigar youll miss it allenby
a shame

  allenby kept his face wooden he had
learned how to do that when he stood in
the dock at the old bailey for three
grueling days a month or so before as
the accused man in the middleton mur-
der trial he was not quite used to be-
ing alive and free yet not many men
came so near the hangman as he had
done only to be given the benefit of the
doubt and acquitted at the end of it
life had become a numb thing for him
but he had not yet ceased to wonder
why when the crowds hustled round
him as he left the courts jethro cobbs
car had appeared from nowhere and
why jethro cobb-whose name he had
never heard before-the next day made
him a kind of secretary-bodyguard for
the pleasure-cruise on his yacht brantane
he was planning

  youre still curious about me allen-
by im the man from nowhere like-
wise the man who pleases himself
dont worry

  i dont said allenby curtly

  thanks youre no humbug at any
rate those people who are coming on
my cruise are he chuckled gravely
that was a sweet advertisement eh
wealthy man undoubtedly eccentric
even possibly mad in the opinion of con-
ventional people wishes to take about
half-a-dozen guests aboard his small pri-
vate yacht for a cruise to the caribbean
to escape awhile from this tired and war-
threatened civilization he strictly re-
serves his right to pick and choose and
his decision in everything is final
the blue book magazine

something like that the real agony
column touch well weve picked our
guests at least i have

  is it to be the caribbean asked al-
lenby indifferently

  possibly answered jethro cob
possibly not

  he turned in the doorway against
the smooth teak paneling his face star-
tlingly young startlingly old was etched
like a fresco there was a contemptuous
compassion in it that caused the young
man to flinch a little because he had
forgotten that jethro cobb like every-
body else must think him guilty of the
middleton murder

  go ashore and take a last look at
peace-time england allenby if you
wish none of the guests will arrive till
after dark and by the way come back
dont leave me in the lurch at the last
moment i need you you ask so few
questions

  allenby flushed perhaps because he
had more than once thought of going
back to the world and facing it

  im not likely to slip you send one
of your watchdogs after me if you doubt
it

  dont be a fool boy jethro cobb
said gently youre the only watchdog
i have

  thdre was little else to do not that
craig allenby cared a hoot about peace-
time england    his loose-limbed fig-
ure stepped ashore from the launch ten
minutes later and swung up from the
harbor to the downs behind nobody up
there would recognize the man who had
been given the benefit of the doubt
he wondered whether any of the guests
of the brantane would know him and
he laughed

it was good to be up there the scent
of the broom was like honey the sun-
set gorgeous he could even grin at the
thought that for all he knew he had
thrown in his lot with a madman who
might mean to scuttle his yacht and take
his guests to the bottom as a punishment
for running away from their country
when war threatened the man from
nowhere it suited jethro cobb he
had no background and though allenby
had been with him a month he had dis-
covered nothing about him save that he
was very rich and utterly unexpected in
everything he did what did the man
resemble one of cromwells ironsides
built on a small scale or a sort of crazy
bunyan without a bible that was it

  quite suddenly craig allenby caught
sight of the black car among the bushes
with the girl leaning against the run-
ning-board he stopped and stared and
then as she came unsteadily to her feet
went forward she saw him and her
eyes widened

  hold up he adjured her

for a moment jan feversham leaned
against him then she was steadying
herself agaiaast the car trying to smile
and not succeeding overmuch

  im all right she said breathlessly
i think the exhaust-pipe leaks a bit-
allenby bent down to a piece of tub-
ing that curved away from the exhaust
outlet and under the floorboards it
caused him to direct his glance past the
open door as the girl made an involun-
tary movement to prevent him he
pressed by her she saw his eyes grow
cold and alert like those of a man who
had grown used to watching out for un-
expected traps

  youve had a narrow escape he said
slowly he wasnt so lucky-or un-
lucky as the case might be-was he
no answered jan

  they inspected each other a blue
dusk was descending about them cutting
them off it seemed from the rest of the
world in it the man looked unnatu-
rally big unnaturally indifferent to what
he had stumbled upon though pity was
in his face to jan it was a strong
rather reckless face and its owner was
either tough or else life had hit him
very hard of late

  i understand i think did he sug-
gest it or was it a genuine agreement
may i ask

  what has it to do with you
nothing on y i believe you could
be charged with murder or manslaugh-
ter or something he was married i
suppose or else you are no you arent
wearing any ring -youre feeling all
right

  all right thanks youve got an un-
pleasant mind but he was married his
name was erich schumann and he was
german mine is jan feversham he
was afraid of being interned and i-
she managed to lift a defiant face which
was pale enough in all conscience be-
cause she was still affected by the dregs
of the fumes-i was pretty miserable
and now you know

  jan knew that she must keep all her
wits he thought she had intended to
die out of love for erich schumann


the submarines treasure

there was a laugh iri that if she could
only find it there was a grim laugh in
the whole business but at least it cov-
ered up kates tracks which was what
mostly mattered kate would be almost
at twelvetrees by now twelvetrees
jan had a feeling f rom nowhere that
she was finished with that impoverished
little farm she had run into something
fantastic where anything could happen
but she must let this man keep on with
his mistake

  allenby spoke again he was per-
plexed

  youre darned cool and you dont
look that sort of little idiot at all
youre in a jam all the same i dont
want to pry into your affairs but id
like to help you im not exactly keen
on the letter of the law myself    you
were whats called in love with him i
presume

  what do you think said jan wea-
rily

  but glad to be here still i know the
feeling someone knew you were with
him i suppose

  jan held her breath the very same
question she had asked kate she shook
her head

  nobody

  craig allenby cursed himself for a
quixotic fool but he said

  better get away from here then as
quickly as possible leave it to me ill
clo my best

  it was nearly dark now searchlights
flickered uneasily out at sea probing for
some treacherous swoop of planes before
war started jan involuntarily searched
allenbys face and he saw that her hair
was dark and soft and her throat white
and strong he believed he had blun-
dered into the sort of commonplace and
not-too-nice drama one read of some-
times in the newspapers but he would
have liked the girl concerned in it to
look more commonplace

near the gorse bush behind them
something seemed to stir just then
causing them both to turn involuntarily
the glow of a cigar became visible and
then a small figure leisurely appeared
it was jethro cobb

  he spoke in the silence

  i followed you allenby im afraid
if youll forgive me ive taken a liking
to you you know    this is a very
tragic affair miss feversham

  jan feversham became conscious of a
pair of magnetic eyes fixed upon her

which she had seen once before and only
once at the old manor house the home
of erich and camilla schumann their
expression was speculative and quite de-
tached and she felt that she was being
observed as a specimen of weak and err-
ing human nature or a bird caught in a
net rather than anything else invol-
untarily she wanted to avoid that pierc-
ing clairvoyance

  erich schumann said jethro cobb
of course i knew him once i saw
you at his house i think miss fever-
sham i dont think the world is much
worse off the wages of sin is death
were told though they are not always
paid in that way and now that youre
not sorry to find yourself alive what do
you propose to do young lady

a sense of weariness began to rise
in jan it seemed an eternity since
kate had hurried away to safety her
thoughts slipped she remembered an
old gypsy woman who had recently come
to twelvetrees and prophesied strange
adventures for her if they included a
charge of murder at the local police
court and a first-class scandal then it
couldnt be helped there was a streak
of obstinacy in her she would keep as
silent as-well as kate herself probably
would but she wished she didnt have
an overwhelming desire to escape and
hide herself somewhere perhaps with
the help of this big young man by her
side-or the feeling that it was impossible
to hide from this other little man she
had seen only once in her life before

  shes going home and im going to
make the police think its a solo busi-
ness said craig allenby

  chivalry or just a natural fellow-
feeling lord what fools these mortals
be jethro cobb smiled dryly but his
glance was luminous it rested on jan

  young lady i dont know whether
youve heard my name its the quaint
one of jethro cobb im an eccentric
a man who works on the spur of the mo-
ment i start on a yacht ing-cruise in a
few hours with a number of guests one
of them has canceled her acceptance i
should like you to take her place the
trip will last a month or so-perhaps
less were all escaping from this dan-
gerous world for a time will you
come

  no answered jan for the first
time she felt really frightened there
was something compelling about this
strange steely little man


the blue book magazine

  i think you will said jethro cobb
briskly it will do you good a ter-
rific emotional storm such as this-he
smiled and it was impossible to say
whether there was irony in it-needs
convalescing from it will make you a
different woman the yacht is called
the brantane and her launch will be
at the harbor pier between eleven oclock
and midnight i shall expect you now
go and leave allenby to report to the
police and settle everything

  by some volition that seemed to be
beyond herself jan found that she was
moving slowly away into the semi-dark-
ness she would never go down to
jethro cobbs yacht of course for one
thing kate would need her badly with-
out her kate would go to pieces and say
something that would betray herself
she stumbled along the path feeling that
it was somebody else and not jan fever-
sham who walked the long way back to
twelvetrees farm

  twelvetrees looked dark and dismal
among its dozen poplars when she
reached it the signboard which had
said for sale or to let for a year
or more made it look derelict there
was no light visible in any of the win-
dows that made her quicken her foot-
steps

  jan lit the lamp in the farm-kitchen
and then stood looking at the message
from kate which she picked up from the
table it was scribbled and short and
faintly-scented on kates best notepaper

    ive packed a few things and gone up
  to london jan  couldnt stand
  twelvetrees now i have some money
  and shall get work you didnt mind
  my opening the little safe i hope i
  have only taken my share as soon as
  im settled ill let you know my address
  but if it isnt for quite a time dont
  worry	-k

chapter two

a pool of bright sunlight swung
rhythmically across the floor of
craig allenbys cabin as the yacht
brantane trod her way leisurely through
the atlantic swell nearly twenty hours
out of port as yet jethro cobbs
guests remained in their cabins either
from inclination or necessity he had
seen none of them and it was unlikely
they had seen each other jethro cobb
himself was conspicuous by his absence

    allenby glanced at the sheet of paper
  which a steward had brought in

     list of guests who will all meet at din-
     ner when we shall be in smooth water
     the rev james catchpole

      mr wackett

      mrs camilla schumann

      miss janet feversham

    his eyes lingered frowningly on the
  last two names etched there in jethro
  cobbs small writing the police had
  not suspected any second person in the
  tragedy on the common a german
  fearing internment had ended his life
  in a not unusual way but mrs ca-
  milla schumann could be no other than
  the man erich schumanns wife

    weird customer wonder what his
  game is and what the deuce does he
  mean by smooth water they think
  theyre bound for the caribbean and
  i guess that agony column advertise-
  ment of his meant nothing at all

    the green rollers slopped past the
  cabin port in the distance a couple of
  destroyers raced past two grim little sis-
  ters of the war tha was coming allen-
  by went up to the bridge and stood by
  mcvenn the taciturn scotch skipper in
  order to watch them-craig allenfiy
  runaway

    i thought wed be well out of sight
  of land by now those are mountains
  over yonder arent they captain mc-
  venn he said suddenly pointing to
  starboard bow

    ireland replied mcvenn north-
  west coast donegal to be exact a
  wild part

    then were off our course

    mcvenn inquired dryly did ye come
  up to my bridge to insult me mr allen-
  by or would ye like to take over the
  navigation yourself i understood we
  were both in the service of mr jethro
  cobb well each to his own job-
  thats what i say the compass is still
  working and were on our course
  allenby opened his mouth to speak
  then stayed silent mcvenn was like a
  clam a dour puritan whose only indulg-
  ence was a doglike loyalty to jethro
  cobb he smiled tory island or tim-
  buctoo either suited him he told him-
  self as he went down presently to dress
  for dinner but despite his armor of
  indifference there was a beat of excite-
  ment in his pulse he dressed leisurely
  and lit a cigarette after the dinner-
  bugle sounded deliberately waiting till
  the guests had gathered in the smoke
  
the submarines treasure

of it he seemed to see dark soft hair and
a pale throat it made him throw his
cigarette aside impatiently and step out
into the corridor--to pull up clumsily at
the sight of janet feversham emerging
from the next cabin

  she smiled with a touch of challenge
and excitement

  were late arent we i slept like a
log after breakfast lor some reason
they all did i think answered al-
lenby with an odd suspicion as to the
possible reason shooting through him
come along and-better brace your-
self for a shock or two it may be a
queer dinner-party

  thanks for what you did for me
sh said under her breath it was ter-
ribly kind i wont forget it

the dining-saloon of the brantane
was a glow of warm lamplight which
illuminated the table where jethro cobb
sat with three people the rev james
catchpole was a large florid man with
benevolent but fishy eyes that twinkled
watchfully behind spectacles mr wack-
ett a small jockeylike individual with
sharp and comic features toyed with his
full wineglass but lit was the woman
who riveted attention with dark green
eyes creamy skin and a mouth curved in
lazy amusement as though at the com-
pany she found herself in erich schu-
manns widow made an unusual pic-
ture she glanced up carelessly then
half-rose from her chair under the shock
as she saw and recognized janet fever-
sham

  pray sit down mrs schumann
came jethro cobbs precise voice now
the company is complete we will all
drink a health to each other

  at the head of the table he sat with
the excited flush of a pleased child on
each of his cheeks the hum of the
brantanes engines was the only sound
audible as she slipped through perfect-
ly smooth water

  the toast will be in the nature of an
introduction ladies and gentlemen we
are for the time being making a little
world of our own therefore we ought
to know each other more or less inti-
mately i begin with my secretary mr
craig allenby a month ago in an old
house in chelsea mr allenby was dis-
covered by the police beside the mur-
dered body of his uncle mr john mid-
dleton whose sole heir he was i will
not go into the details he was charged
with murder and the evidence was black
against him he had been leading a
rather gay life in london and he need-
ed money in any case he was a sinner
jethro cobb paused but there was
some flaw in the evidence a matter of
identification by a servant who was on
the premises i think he was also de-
fended by a very clever counsel he was
giver the benefit of the doubt and ac-
quitted

 somebody murmured gawd and
then swiveled his fascinated glance from-
jethro cobb to look at allenby it was
mr wackett but-as under a spell the
others remained still if jethro cobb
had wished to provide his guests with a
dramatic entertainment at their first
meeting he had succeeded

obbs gentle voice went on

a lady now mrs camilla schu-
mann the very charming woman by
your side mr wackett the details in
her case are not so clean-cut hers was
an ancient crime which women have
often excelled in she tried to poison
her husband who luckily for himself-
for the time being-discovered the plan
and checkmated it the motive seems
to have been jealousy but there may
have been some deeper reason ladies
and gentlemen i pass no judgment
the small eagle-like face leaned for-
ward earnestly allenby may be com-
pletely innocent mrs schumann may
have given way to sudden temptation
the blue book magazine

and repented immediately her hus-
band was no saint but she was also a
sinner

  cant you see that hes stark mad
whispered camilla schumann huskily
are you all going to sit here and listen
to this nonsense

  mrs schumanns husband is now out
of reach of poison said jethro cobb
that may be news to mrs schumann
who i understand came direct to the
brantane from london he killed him-
self and this unhappy young lady miss
janet feversham elected to die with
him i understand but she escaped
alive one might feel sorry for miss
feversham one might hesitate to cast
the first stone but nevertheless she was
a sinner

jan feversham turned away from the
hard face of the woman who stared
at her across the table telling herself
that this was only some sort of queer
dream wine spilled by camilla schu-
mann made a stain on the cloth mr
wackett fingered his cigarette-case nerv-
ously and the rev james catchpole
cleared his throat a hiatus seemed to
have occurred in the drama of which
he as a clergyman felt bound to take
advantage to soothe and gently rebuke
their extraordinary host catchpole had
glanced stealthily at everybody so far
save craig allenby as allenby himself
had subconsciously noted now he said
suavely

  mr cobb this is all most disturbing
though we all expected something un-
usual no doubt the facts you present
may be true or otherwise but surely
on a restful trip like this all mankinds
concern is charity as the poet says and
we shall find each other out as we go
along

  so far said jethro cobb with a
glance of icy mirth that seemed to strip
mr catchpole of his dog-collar and cleri-
cal mien at one and the same moment
i have dealt with the sinners-the
mere weaklings one might say take
your hand out of your coat pocket mr
wackett for if you use the automatic
pistol you have there youll hang as sure
as your name isnt wackett allenby
keep an eye on mr wackett    ladies
and gentlemen mr catchpole and mr
wackett i believe are not strictly sin-
ners save against society they are simple
professional criminals and yet since
there is so much good in the worst of us
as another poet says mr catchpole-

he paused perhaps not entirely crim-
inal they will afford us light relief
by profession they specialize in black-
mail each has made but a poor living
at it they had an idea that there was
something shady about this cruise and
having discovered that i was a wealthy
man they answered my advertisement
in their present guise much to my pleas-
ure do i bore any of you

  monstrousl murmured catchpole
monstrous 

  but both he and mr wackett who
looked like a wicked little weasel cor-
nered for a moment sat without moving
the wind completely taken out of their
sails jethro cobbs eyelids fell and
then he smiled all round the table

  you will perceive my friends he
said that none of the company here are
hardened criminals not even messrs
catchpole and wackett whom i take to
be merely two lazy and cruel men who
make a living by their wits mr catch-
pole i believe has a young wife he is
very fond of otherwise i dont know a
lot about mr catchpole    even mr
wackett is not without virtue though
he does carry a firearm which he will
presently hand over to allenby   
mind you im not sure what the dis
will bring forth for us the evil or the
good the cowardice or the courage so
to speak it is my purpose to discover
one of them

a soft laugh came abruptly from
camilla schumann she had com-
pletely recovered her poise her eyes
danced across at craig allenby for an in-
stant but went immediately to the little
figure at the head of the table

  i think im going to like this speak-
ing personally mr cobb she said to
be made the subject of a social experi-
ment its heaps better than any war
but where are you taking us to hon-
est nowl

  jethro cobb stepped from his chair
to the long windows and pulled aside
the curtains though the saloon was
brightly lighted it was still daylight
outside a daylighi of smooth shot-silk
water and wild purple mountains that
rose on every side he pointed to a gray
castellated pile on the shore of the quiet
lough the brantane crept into it stood
there as though carved out of the rock
that supported it

  sinners castle said jethro cobb
almost shyly a ridiculous name but
i like it


the submarines treasure

  sinners castle murmured camilla
schumann how perfectly marvelous
is it to be a kind of concentration-camp
for us all mr cobb

but cobb drew close the curtains of
the cabin windows again and went
back to his place at the head of the table
as though he had not heard her the
brantane throbbed at half-speed and
the electric fans hummed quietly after
a moments interval cobb raised his
glass

  i drink to you all ladies and gentle-
men if any should prefer to go back
to england with the yacht when she
leaves they are of course at liberty to
do so there is no compulsion but i
hope you will all decide to accept my
hospitality

  a moment later he had left them al-
most before they knew it his little fig-
ure with its slight limp disappearing
through a doorway behind him he
made a small old-fashioned bow of apol-
ogy before he went

  jan feversham found herself glanc-
ing with rather surprising calmness at
the four other people left around the
tabje craig allenby by her side had a
faint hard smile of amusement and ca-
milla schumanns dark green eyes rest-
ed on him thoughtfully not for the
first time mr wackett had refilled his
glass to the brim and sat with his lips
pursed in a noiseless whistle it was the
reverend james catchpole the pseudo-
clergyman who at length broke the si-
lence his voice was shaken but brave

  hallucinations he said i would
even go so far as to call it delusional in-
sanity i remember a very devoted mem-
ber of my own congregation-

  do stop it please said camilla
with gentle impatience

  she-leaned white elbows on the table
the lamplight made her creamy skin
glow faintly she said

  hes weird isnt he he tfnows every-
thing or thinks he does    letsall be
sensible were discovered more or
less i knew you and erich were fond
of each other jan-though i never
thought youd be such a couple of fools
i didnt worry much so well let bygones
be bygones now were all in one family
so to speak    would it shock you very
much to learn that i did think of poi-
soning my husband mr allenby

  not particularly answered craig
allenby laconically long ago he had
decided that nothing brought about by

jethro cobb should surprise him he
smiled at camilla schumann fully con-
scious of her attraction but more inter-
ested in the woman herself

  after he tried to poison me because
i found out by accident that he was act-
ing as a nazi agent perhaps ill tell
you the details later it was a rather
awful duel of wits and i was glad to
come on this little holiday for a rest
finished camilla

  liar thought jan she wants to
impress him with her innocence and
theres a lot more to it than that she
wants to convey to him what cheap stuff
i am too not that it matters hes very
likely a murderer we cant possibly all
be innocent or even half-innocent
well thats briefly me said camilla
her thick dark lashes flickered i sus-
pect you never killed that uncle of yours
either mr allenby though we can all
be broad-minded at a place with such a
delightful name as sinners castle im
thrilling all over arent you jan

  a bit answered jan slowly she
was wondering why all at once she be-
gan to hate and fear camilla schumann
but i think wed better all be careful
of each other i mean do you remem-
ber what he said about bringing forth
the evil or the good in us

camillas eyebrows went up and
a snicker came from mr wackett
whose sharp nose was now bent over
a plate of hors doeuvres both he ancl
catchpole had a masked look like two
cats who found themselves in a loft of
plump pigeons and tried not to show
it yet there was something deeper and
more disturbed than that about both of
them jan wondered who are they
really

  poppycock said mr wackett hes
no magician though what with poison
and murder we make a swell bunch i
never heard anything like it not mr
wackett ended smoothly that there
arent extenuating circumstances in ev-
erything were the last to judge arent
we mr catchpole

  sure you are craig allenby reached
a hand across the table that gun
if you please mr wackett

  for a moment mr wackett hesitated
then with a sheepish grin and a remark
about tough spots in santa cruz or some-
where now being wiped out he handed
it over gracefully

  camilla schumann observed gravely
well then well all make a vow to live
the blue book magazine

in love and friendship together while
were at sinners castle and not try to
kill each other or anything like that in
spite of mr cobbs kind remarks so
its settled and now i wonder when
we shall have something to eat im
ravenous

the yacht whispered through the wa-
ter while dinner was being served
ten minutes later jethro cobb joined
them again for the luxurious meal he
had obviously left them alone purposely
though probably he had listened to their
conversation there was something
gnomelike though perfectly dignified
about him and when he at length led
the way to the deck he seemed to be-
long to the wild donegal landscape that
met their eyes as though he had come
limping out of one of the hollows of the
hills the brantane floated close in-
shore on a mauve mirror of water into
which the image of the mountains
dipped darkly a few seabirds wailed
in the squat-turreted mass of sinners
castle now lying black and mysterious
by the shore lights gleamed it looked
as old as the hills themselves and as re-
mote from human life

  what is its real name asked jan

  cobb glanced at her cashel murtag
is its real name he answered mur-
tag was a chieftain of these parts and in
the old irish tongue he was nicknamed
the sinner so im not so fanciful miss
feversham things dont change in this
country much not even the names mur-
tag began as a saint and ended as a sin-
ner i believe there was a woman or
two in it

  jan stood with the others on the boat
platform and dreamily watched the silky
water flow past in the half-dark there
was something sleepy and druglike in the
evening with its smell of sea-salt and
pines something unreal about every-
thing lightly leaning against the rope
rail she tried to wonder what had hap-
pened to kate but failed kate had

only been an instrument in all this be-
cause there was a sort of destiny in it
she was conscious of mr wackett sniff-
ing enjoyably at a cigar of craig allen-
by behind her and the scent of a ciga-
rette that camilla schumann smoked
the motor-launch was being lowered
but the brantane still moved with a
lazily-turning screw 

  take care jan or youll be in came
camillas warning voice

  jan half-turned and with horrible
suddenness the white rope she leaned
upon gave way there was no chance
to keep her balance though mr wack-
ett shouted and made a snatch at her
the water closed over her head and she
went down with her lungs full of salty
water it was nearly warm and jan
could swim but a vague terror gripped
her somebody loosened that rope and
it was camilla schumann flashed
through her mind fighting hard she
strove to rise to the surface only to find
that some strong current pulled her
down then she came up to the light
again the white sides of the yacht slid-
ing above her as she gasped for air the
slowly-threshing screw not a dozen yards
away gleaming bronze blades drawing
nearer to cut her to pieces sidling side-
wise toward her    camilla had worked
things out well in that first murder at-
tempted at sinners castle

  it all passed across jan as though it
were somebody else who fought there
with it was a cool wonderment as to
why camilla should have taken the trou-
ble unless she was a homicidal maniac
mad with jealousy and grief after all
then she saw craig allenbys face in the
green water by her side

  take a long breath he snapped
youre going under again if you dont
want to be sliced in two

  he dived deep taking her with him
and holding her fast while the dull
thunder of the propeller passed over
them then left them floating behind in
the creamy wake of it the danger past


the submarines treasure

already the motor-launch was shooting
toward them allenby still held her

  thanks-im all right she said
then she spluttered and laughed un-
steadily you dont think i did it on
purpose to give you a-a sort of regular
job the rope must have slipped or
broken or something

  she felt tired yet exhilarated as the
launch took them to the boat platform
she must not betray to anybody her cer-
tainty that it was not an accident she
saw camilla looking as startled and con-
cerned as anybody and thought can
she possibly have meant to get me out of
the way because shes fallen in love with
him is she that kind of a primitive
woman

all right miss feversham asked
j jethro cobb standing close to her
his small bright eyes intent that was
a narrow escape ill get the skipper to
speak to the man who looped that rope
so carelessly

  jan laughed shakenly not much pre-
tence was required to do that

  the skipper ought to speak to me
good and well it was my own fault
leaning against it like that but ill be
moft careful in future

  jethro cobbs glance raked all over
her as though he saw her clearly and
was interested in her for the first time
it was like that of some very intelligent
child who missed nothing and wistfully
longed to understand there was no
hiding it from him he knew and he
knew that she knew

  youre not vindictive the ques-
tion was barely audible she was com-
pelled to answer equally low

  no but-

  he spoke before he moved away
  dont be but take care

  the launch purree toward sinners
castle with its passengers leaving a
phosphorescent trail behind it some-
where in the dark pile a dog barked
and far away to seaward there was an
uneasy metallic hum in the sky was
it airplanes jan wondered perhaps the
war had already broken and out there
where the atlantic roared the u-boats
were lurking on their bed of death it
didnt seem to matter at sinners castle
especially to somebody who had just had
an attempt made on her life   

  camilla schumann sat by her side
jan was not afraid of camilla now on
the other hand she felt that she had
started a long duel with her

    i

  camillas hand touched jans

  youre wet lucky its a warm night
we seem to have started well i must
say with a near-drowning and a gallant
rescue jan you dont think im jeal-
ous

 of-

  she nearly said of craig it star-
tled her tremendously that she should
think of him by his christian name so
suddenly though she was shivering a
little her cheek burned under cover of
the darkness

  camillas voice went on

  of erich-or his memory he was a
perfect swine really you know like all
people of his race he was a prussian
i had an idea once that it wasnt you
but your young sister kate  a pause
camillas green eyes were invisible now
above her beautifully modeled cheek-
bones but they watched her jan was
sure anyway were both better off
and youll forget him soon enough   
isnt he strong and silent

 who

  well not mr wackett craig allen-
by

i suppose he is i havent noticed
camilla laughed and glanced at the
stern where craig allenby sat beside
jethro cobb with his big shoulders
against the dying afterglow

  thats funny both you and craig
are strait-laced he thinks youre-well
a bit soiled married lover and all that
and you think its a hundred to one he
was guilty of that murder personally
i dont give a damn im no little white
hen myself    its most fascinating i
wouldnt be anywhere else for worlds
i dont care much what he thinks of
me said jan indifferently though
im grateful for what he did just now
of course

  she wondered if it got over

chapter three

on the old terrace of the castle in the
late afternoon craig allenby stood
looking out at the panorama of moun-
tain and glen that stretched as far as he
could see the highlands of donegal
lifted to the horizon on one side on the
other the empty lough-for the brantane
had gone-ran out to the atlantic across
which the nearest land was newfound-
land tier upon tier the mountains
rose he liked them they seemed clean
and honest and strong on castle mur-


the blue book magazine

tag itself jethro cobb must have spent a
small fortune to redeem it from the de-
cay of a century corridors and ban-
queting-hall as well as its ten habitable
bedrooms were furnished with astonish-
ing comfort-though so far the only serv-
ants visible were a man and his wife a
silent irish couple jethro cobb had
discoursed cheerfully about the salmon
streams the grouse on the moors-and
the ghost of murtag the sinner that one
could take a pot-shot at with a silver
bullet after dark mr wackett in a
canary waistcoat was full of breezy wise-
cracks mr catchpole no longer in
clergymans attire was quiet and greas-
ily dignified but very watchful both
men allenby felt were spurious ca-
milla schumann set some hot nerve
pleasantly throbbing within him she
was pagan as for jan feversham-no
he must avoid her in some vague way
she hurt him

  he turned and saw camilla schumann
by his side very fresh and vital enough
to stir the pulse of any man

  its a lovely scene isnt it she said
softly a long way from war    do
you know its staried i happened to
find a radio-set and switched it on but
what does it matter to us

she was breathing quickly as though
in excitement and she turned and
looked out at the mouth of the lough
for an instant brushing him with her
shoulder as she did so

  i only hope one of the u-boats
doesnt come and shell sinners castle
she laughed

  they did something of the sort in
the last war allenby returned at
least they were supposed to come in and
make themselves quite at home here
they lay at the mouth of the lough ac-
cording to local rumor and the officers
came ashore to the castle it was empty
then

  who told you that she asked curi-
ously it seemed to him that she looked
startled

  cobb but he couldnt know he
only bought the place a year or two ago

  hes mad of course but quite ami-
ably so do you see the flag flying on
the top of the tower its his- own de-
sign he ran it up the moment he heard
war was declared it must be visible
miles out at sea

  allenby let himself become conscious
of camillas magnetism she intrigued
him perhaps there was something dan-

gerous about her but he was in a mood
for danger inwardly he gibed at him-
self danger war had happened and
he was in hiding at the service of an ec-
centric lunatic

  youre bitter about that trial of
yours craig arent you jans sure you
were guilty im certain you werent
does it matter

  no nothing matters here dont
you feel that already after all this is
like a pleasure cruise where things hap-
pen quickly   but id rather we didnt
look on each other as a couple of out-
and-out bad people were just human
thats why im not grieving for my hus-
band    poor jan and im going to
like you a lot craig allenby

her lips touched his as lightly as a
butterflys wing closed and dewy
then she laughed and looked at him in-
scrutably

  youre innocent of that murder all
right craig she said and youre not
likely to carry out any of jethro cobbs
hopes and fears at sinners castle well
listen i said id perhaps tell you my
story didnt i its a strange one to
start with erich had a secret radio and
the old manor house was only a ifiile
from the sea all the men of his family
are in the german navy-the submarine
service even in the last war they were
i shouldnt wonder if some of them came
here at one time camilla paused
they might even come again this war
their sons their nephews you know
at kiel they called the schumanns the
unterseekinder and they certainly are
submarine babies their u-boats have
been hanging out in the atlantic for
months and erich kept them in touch
with shipping movements i found that
out all in one horrible hour i thought
he never suspected and that when war
began id be able to hand him over to
scotland yard red-handed but he sus-
pected all right

  her shudder turned into a shrug

  he tried to poison me first aconi-
tine it leaves no trace i took a leaf
out of his book she said laconically
only once then i got frightened be-
cause im no lucrezia borgia how
jethro cobb found out i dont know
he only came to the house once or twice
hes not human i believe hell crumble
to dust when he dies or else go back in-
to a bottle

  camilla leaned against the parapet
and finished
the submarines treasure

  so you see it wasnt jealousy at all
it was a mixture of patriotism and self-
preservation i didnt worry about his
aflair with jan feversham though it was
open enough she knew about the radio-
station too because i once saw them
both go into the summerhouse where it
was hidden such things dont matter
much when you are infatuated i sup-
pose he meant to use her in some way

from among the red virginia creep-
er just beneath the wall of the ter-
race jan heard every word before she
sidled noiselessly away with her hand on
the leash of the wollhound puppy she
held the puppy in search of an imag-
inary rat had pulled her into the under-
growth and without any real twinge of
conscience she had stayed and listened
sinners castle with its corridors and
buttresses was well provided with eaves-
dropping posts

  she wondered soberly what had made
camilla schumann choose that particu-
lar fiction about herself the woman
was far too subtle to keep on blackening
her to craig allenby like a jealous serv-
ant-girl therefore it followed that the
wimple of her story might be deliberately
invented for some reason but why to
test him-to use him in some way

  dont be a fool youll be saying shes
a german spy who intends to poison us
all and turn the castle into a u-boat
base next and she had no more idea
than the rest of us that we werent going
to the caribbean or somewhere

  a voice sounded by her side as she
stood looking at the dark woods across
the water it was mr wackett now in
a vividly green deerstalker hat and plus-
fours he said humorously

  nobody been doing a spot of doing-
in yet that one could notice eh miss
feversham well theres a war on at
last and therell be plenty of doing-in
soon i guess funny thing how you go
all patriotic when it coms holidays
like this seem a sin if it is a holiday
ended wackett dubiously but them
mountains get me look at em not
that i wouldnt mind a long tramp over
em if i had a map always a great
walker i was

  mr cobbs sure to have one in the
library said jan

  thanks-good idea gawd this is a
good funk-hole id recommend it to
some of the ol dears whove gone as far
into cornwall as they can i would ire-
land eh cant help looking round for

the paddys and the pigs and old mother
oreilly sitting at the cabin door with
her clay pipe but there aint any such
he coughed

  rum business this aint it not good
enough for respectable crooks like
catchpole and me wackett grinned
but his impudence had a touch of wick-
edness behind it love-interest start-
ing too a hot affair itll be with that
green-eyed blonde in it bit dangerous
considering her hobby too but better
than being buried in quicklime as that
bloke might have been by now except
for a bit of luck

  jan felt herself flinch the man was
looking at her with cold curiosity she
obviously intrigued him of course he
knew the story of erich schumann and
herself jethro cobb had spared no-
body forlornly she cursed kate who
had probably already half-forgotten er-
ich schumann and her elder sister and
all the rest of her life at twelvetrees
farm

  wackett said with his habitual grin
shes rich isnt she-that mrs schu-
mann she brought a nice bit of jew-
elry ashore with her

  jan answered calmly

  i dare say her room would be worth
breaking into if you thought of doing
it and then finding your way back to
civilization over the hills and far away
out of the reach of jethro cobb mr
wackett but i warn you there are miles
of mountain to cross-old man and
saddleback pat and the seven bens i
got them all from mr cobb and there
are acres on acres of bog

a laugh came from wackett he
lifted his deerstalker

  see my old shako miss feversham

i	take it off theres something about
you its an idea sure i guess cobb
wouldnt interfere sinners castle
where there aint no ten command-
ments and a man can raise a thirst-and
satisfy it handsomely i will say thats
his notion well if catchpole and me
get a bit tired well take your hint miss
feversham and id like to see that
blonde lay police information or any-
body else for that matter
the blue book magazine

  jan looked after the little man as he
lounged jauntily downward to the rocks
where mr catchpole sat in a boat with
some fishing-tackle he didnt appear to
know what to do with wackett turned
with a wave of his hand that expressed
his irony she wished for a moment that
she hadnt been so quick with her
tongue and suddenly felt that she stood
a lonely figure on the edge of unknown
abysses that scared her she knew no
more real truth about wackett and
catchpole than she did about camilla
and craig allenby and jethro cobb him-
self if she told craig the truth about
her sister kate and erich schumann and
enlisted his help-her face went obsti-
nately up to the sea-wind that blew the
waters of the lough into dark purple
she wasnt going to do that if he want-
ed to fall for camilla he could have her
with a slight start she perceived jethro
cobbs little face at one of the deep-sunk
windows in the gray wall behind her be-
fore he vanished without haste

  presently camilla and craig allenby
came down from the terrace together

  were taking a couple of guns out on
the moor jan called camilla com-
ing

  but jan hugged the wolfhound puppy
with a smile ive made a pal and i
feel lazy

already the thought had started
k morally there was a good excuse
for breaking into the room and search-
ing the belongings of a woman who had
tried to kill her if she left any trace
and camilla made a fuss then she would
calmly pass on the credit of it to messrs
catchpole and wackett jan laughed
grimly at herself she was growing clev-
er quietly she slipped through the
great oak doorway and up the dark stair-
case where two old galleon lamps al-
ready shed a soft light only to find the
door of camillas room firmly locked
but from her own window a coping
with plenty of ivy to cling to ran to ca-
millas after dark there might be a
chance that way the streak of obsti-
nacy in jan was working now at full
pressure 

  she lay on the bed and pretended a
headache at dinnertime-and fortune
seemed to favor her for camilla and
craig allenby were not back for dinner
watching a big yellow moon rise she
felt a bit sick at the thought of those
two people together under it with her
chin on her hand she wondered soberly



  whether she could stop herself falling in
love with craig if it wasnt too late
once she thought she heard distant gun-
fire far out at sea but it died away

it was late when in dark trousers and
shirt jan began to climb along the
coping cashel murtag slumbered in
black and silver without any sound with-
in it as she scrambled noiselessly along
its old ivy the window when she
reached -it mas slightly open and with
one last look at the moonlit moors
where camilla like the she-cat she was
kept abroad the man she pursued jan
entered as she did so the clock in the
tower chimed with disconcerting sud-
denness eleven rusty strokes   

  a hide trunk empty a wardrobe full
of clothes and the elusive hated scent of
camilla over everything a dressing-
table drawer unlocked within it three
jewel-cases though her heart tripped
quickly jan searched methodically the
jewelry looked good-an excellent haul
for messrs catchpole and wackett no
letters but deep within a small leather
writing-case one single linen-mounted
sheet of an ordnance survey map old
and stained as though with sea-waer
jan took it into the moonlight and
stared at it there were the names
old man and saddleback pat derry-
veigh and blackadders bog with at the
bottom plainly marked cashel mur-
tagr

  all the time then camilla had either
known or guessed ihat the brantane was
coming to sinners castle

 there was a monogram on the writ-
ing-case jan noticed now es it
had belonged to camillas husband to
the man who had sought to make kate
die with him not long before perhaps
it had held other things besides the map
but now something slipped from behind
the blotting-pad and fluttered to the
floor it was an old newspaper-clipping
dated november  yellow and fad-
ed but clear to read in the pencil light
of her small flashlight

    despite the mutiny at kiel and the
  end of the german navy it is assumed
  that a number of unterseebooten are
  still at sea and fear is expressed that
  some of their demoralized crews may
  turn privateers ontheir own after peace
  is signed the sinking of the american
  ship kermesse two hundred miles irorn
  the irish coast by a u boat whose men
  boarded the vessel transferred a quanti-
the submarines treasure

    ty of gold bullion she was carrying and
  made away with it lends colour to this

  it would not be difficult for these mod-
  ern pirates before returning to their
  base to deposit their booty in some lone-
  ly spot on the coast until a more fa-
  vourable time for retrieving it

  that was all jan carefully replaced
map and clipping site felt excited in a
cool and steadfast way that surprised
herself no use trying to conjecture
anything at sinners castle no doubt
one waited for things to happen and
they did without fail if camilla came
back while she was there something
drastic might easily happen to her she
turned to the window as she did so
there was an unexpected sound

  it was the click of a key being fitted
into the lock of the door in the few
seconds it fumbled jan found herself
backing not in the direction of the win-
dow but toward the big sheraton ward-
robe which made an angle with the wall
as she went she picked up a heavy can-
dlestick from the table which she had
mentally noted before that with a
pleasurable thrill she told herself that
thg time camilla should receive as good
as she gave if she asked for it then her
arm fell to her side

  it was not camilla at all the fore-
most figure which came softly along the
thick carpet was tha of mr wackett
and in his footsteps padded the late rev
mr catchpole they were clothed as
though for a sudden and urgent journey

  mr wackett hummed softly to him-
self as he sprayed a flashlight leisurely
round the room but catchpoles voice
held nervousness when he spoke

  for mikes sake dont croon like
thatl lets get on with it and clear out

wackett opened the dressing-
table drawer

  were here he said softly to help
ourselves if the blondecorhes back
from the moonlight-though shewont
because blondes like moonlight-shes
welcome to watch us as good as kid-
naped werent we and put into bad
company poisoners murderers and all
that this is just compensation

  id rather find what the game is
here might be worth a hundred thou-
sand if hes made it a submarine base
or anything like that all right laugh
at the idea

  im not only at you youre scared
of old jethro me too a bird in the

  hand is worth two in the bush    see
the pretty birds little robin red-
breasts wackett scooped a pendant of
rubies from its case pocketing them ex-
pertly humming again camilla had
evidently brought all her jewelry on the
trip jan crushed herself into the shad-
ow as catchpole snooped close both
men were afraid though they showed it
differently-both glad to be shaking the
dust of sinners castle from their feet

  clean-up murmured mr wackett
well exit by the window as pre-
arranged over the hills and far away
as the little suicide-dame put it bless
her

  no reply left catchpole because he
was staring through the shadows at the
door which had opened with a mini-
mum of sound craig allenby standing
there seemed to fill the doorway he
looked at both of them

orry gentlemen he said will
you come down and see mr cobb
and mrs schumann

  why should we asked catchpole
huskily finding voice

  its only polite cobbs the host and
mrs schumanns the owner no dont
go for the window wackett ive got
your pistol yet-though i dont promise
to use it i can manage easily without

  came back and dogged us didnt
you young mr slip-the-drop you and
the blonde said wackett he tried to
grin but looked like a malevolent little
ferret badly done by

  we did

  craig with one hand propelled wack-
ett out into the corridor and his com-
panion followed with more dignity but
scarcely less speed in her corner jan
heard the door close a long breath
came from her she did not hesitate
but crossed to the dressing-table from
the still-open drawer she took erich
schumanns small leather writing-case
and thrust it into her shirt it was all
done on impulse and whether it was
stupid or clever she didnt stop to con-
sider   

  the ivy felt cold and slippery on her
return journey low out at sea the
searchlights were criss-crossing there
were half a dozen soft sullen booms that
made her pause on the coping thinking
of depth-charges and u-boats but once
in her own room she did not pause save
to change into a more convincing sleep-
ing-suit and dressing-gown    her
mind was made up if all the clan at


the blue book magazine

sinners castle was gathering below in-
cluding camilla she certainly didnt
mean to be left out of it

  quietly she opened the door

  hullo jan

  she tried not to jump back though it
was camilla who stood there in the cor-
ridor in the dim light camilla was in-
substantial save for her almond eyes
which with lazy laughter were full up-
on jan she looked like the ghost of
some woman who might once at cashel
murtag have driven murtag the sinner
to the devil and wandered ihe place ever
since

  i heard a noise and it startled me so
i came out to see

  jan wondered if her tone sounded
too defiant but camilla merely nodded

  catchpole and wackett limited-
very limited-after my jewels she said
craig and i laid a trap for them came
back quietly in spite of the delicious
moonlight and craig ran them in   
come down to the judgment-seat jan
if youre not too sleepy judge jethro is
in full session

as they went down the staircase the
spell of sinners castle stirred jans
fancies into riot she actually kept a
stair behind camilla just as a precau-
tion for she felt that a fall downstairs
resulting in a broken neck might be
engineered more successfully than an acci-
dental plunge into the brantanes pro-
peller at the same time she could not
quell a sharp zest for adventure and a
cool wonder whether she might not get
in the trick herself before camilla did
if she really tried

  jan decided to wait   

  when they reached the circular room
which was the small library of sinners
castle jethro cobb sat huddled in an
armchair beside a peat-fire which glowed
redly in the hearth despite the mildness
of the night he looked up as jan and
camilla entered and his blue eyes in
their deep sockets rested on both wom-
en as though comparing them he
smiled faintly

  what is to be done with these two
most miserable sinners mrs schumann
he asked theres an old iron gallows
down by the rocks dating from the days
when robbery was punished that way
and a dungeon or two i believe you
wouldnt like to be hangman or jailer
allenby

  wacketts hand brushed across his
sharp nose laughter in court he ob-

served ironically but a bead of sweat
stood on catchpoles upper-lip in spite
of the sickly smile which tried to assure
the company that it was all a feeble
joke for the first time his eyes hung
like those of a sick dog upon allenby

  you vulgar imbeciles said jethro
cobb softly im disappointed i bring
you here as my guests i try a modest psy-
chological experiment on you and this
is what happens what clumsy crafts-
men i wasorry to have to warn mrs
schumann and instruct allenby to keep
a watch you will perceive that youre
now in what is called a cleft stick
there was hatred in wacketts face
looking narrowly jethro cobb saw it
he chuckled all at once

  so you feel humiliation i believe
youd kill me if you could and allen-
by too of course thats better ive a
contempt for the small passions catch-
pole cant i stir some bile in you also
please dont said jan quickly

  cobb sent her that wistful searching
glance it was gone in an instant but
he was silent camilla laughed and
said carelessly

  lets forget it all theres noth-
ing missing-nothing valuable anyway
the pause she made sent a queer tingle
through jan theres something pecu-
liar about this place i suppose lets
absolutely forget it but dont do it
again will you didnt mr cobb tell
us your wife was young mr catchpole
her smile was charming mischievous
young said catchpole huskily and
beautiful

  well i suppose they were meant for
her everybody says that this war is only
part of a social revolution that means the
leveling up of possessions all round
please say nothing more about it but
dont hate mr cobb however much he
asks you to nor you either mr
wackett and dont leave sinners cas-
tle and break up the party

  no said wackett his slit of a mouth
white at the comers

when they had gone jethro cobb
sighed he sat with his head down
gazing at the blue peat-flames as if in
a reverie that way he looked timelessly
old though he was hardly more than
middle-aged presently he stood out of
the chair and gave a litle ceremonious
bow directed at camilla schumann

  all that fresh air and exercise must
have made you tired mrs schumann
did you bring anything down


the submarines treasure

  a few grouse nothing else
camilla was on her feet too smil-
ing but stiffly holding the little mans
glance as she took her dismissal jan
thought like lightning he means did
she bring craig down and she knows it
hes trying to make her hate him too
and succeeding very xuell

  sleep well jethro cobb watched
camilla leave the room then rubbed his
hands together with a crisp sound a
striking woman allenby both in looks
and character a man who was reckless
enough and liked tigers for their lovely
skins would be very much attracted to
her or-cobb finished almost mus-
ingly-a man who didnt give a care
about anything a weakling avhod
thrown up the fight and run away hed
fall for her though he might despise
himself all the time

  he doesnt mince his words does he
miss feversham sa d craig allenby

tooking at him jan knew that it was

ji much too late to stop herself falling

in love with him there was no thrill in
it it was more like a feeling of catas-
trophe than anything else he stood
lightly against the back of a chair lean-
fated and smiling armored within him-
self he cared nothing for cobb and
certainly he cared nothing for jan fever-
sham

  mr cobbs trying to make you hate
him said jan

  craig laughed no go hes set his
heart on a murder happening here even
if it has to be himself i refuse to do
his dirty work any further instructions
mr cobb

 not tonight said jethro cobb grave-
ly putting out a thin hand then you
stay please miss feversham

  she felt allenbys glance linger on her
as he left the room but it was only curi-
osity the red peat fell in with a small
crash as an uneasy wind blew from the
mountains about the chinaneys of sin-
ners castle and set the waters outside
lapping the effect of loneliness of iso-
lation was intense

  i want to tell you my story miss
feversham said jethro cobb sudden-
ly breaking the silence

  jan leaned forward long ago any
sense of fantasy hael gone whatever
jethro cobb said or did must be ac-
cepted but she had to speak

  first i want to tell you mine she
said at least i want to say that i nev-
er joined erich schumann in any sui-

cide-pact it was my younger sister and
it was only foolishness on her part craig
allenby-and you-found me after id
sent her home and was trying to rub out
her tracks i hated him

  jethro cobb showed no emotion at het
words	

  i thought something of the kind so
theres one of us at least who is complete-
ly innocent-you i imagine the other
is allenby never mind he cuddled
his eagle-face and white hair deeper in-
to his chair and smiled

  now listen to me t came out of pris-
on two years ago after serving five years
for manslaughter i dont look it do
i my sister was very young like yours
the man wouldnt leave her alone i
was a puritan-i am still but hot-
blooded  wrote him violent letters
and i gloated on the hiding i meant to
give i meant to cripple him so that he
would never show himself on the stage
again-he was a well-known actor i got
a terrific kick out of it there was a
good honest john of a man who wanted
to marry my sister you understand

  one day like a thunderclap i real-
ized the evil pleasure i was giving my-
self it wasnt for my sister i meant to
half-kill him it was for my own delight
 was a pathological case if i didnt pull
myself together i was gradually plan-
ning to destroy the man well i prayed
i believe in prayer the evil spirit left
me but a little later the man was
found dead in a country lane badly bat-
tered with my heavy-handled horsewhip
beside him weak heart honest john
had done my beating-up forme but killed
the man honest john and my sister
were already secretly married and-i
went to prison not from any self-sacri-
fice for the lords sake dont think
that miss feversham honest john and
i never really liked each other but
what else could i do when i was guilty

the man seemed animated for a mo-
ment then he stared mildly at jan
-an unwinking stare

  hence this eccentric experiment of
mine he ended camilla schumann
guilty yet innocent allenby probably
likewise but certainly nicely balanced
between good and evil catchpole and
wackett poor devils not exactly sure
what they are yourself- his voice
dropped oddly no youre the only
really white sheep thats your natural
color its all a psychological experi-
ment so dont think theres anything


the blue book magazine

else to it-a german submarine base or
hidden treasure or anything like that

  so completely unexpected were jethro
cobbs last words that jan stared back
at him in turn he contradicted him-
self in everything he said as though he
took a gentle pleasure in confusing her
inwardly she cried out in protest at
everything she only had one insignifi-
cant clipping from an old newspaper
and a contour map not of the currents
and soundings and bearings of the lough
but of the hills and bogs inland but
he appeared to know she had them

  youve brave he said after what
she tried to do to you theres no mys-
tery about how i know this place is
full of holes and corners and im small
and active i know you went into her
room i admired you for it

  youre very frightening mr cobb
said jan in a low voice

  slightly mad you mean everybody
is my dear ill keep on with it look
at this

after ascertaining that the door was
l closed he limped briskly to the
high mantel and thrust at one of the
smoke-stained panels when he turned
there was a circular disk of dull metal
resting in his palm gesturing jan to
the standard lamp he gave it to her and
she found herself looking at a miniature
but perfectly engraved copy of the con-
tour map which lay hidden in her own
room at that instant it differed in one
respect where the hump of saddleback
pat rose from blackadders bog a tiny
speck of mica embedded in the metal
glinted marked mysteriously finn mac-
cool

  a clever bit of craftsmanship said
jethro cobb watching her nearly
twenty years old the metal was cut by
oxy-acetylene from a torpedo-fin and the
etching done with an engineers needle
by a man who had little else to do just
then at the end of the last war as
much as anything he did it for amuse-
ment i believe while his submarine lay
in the lough here before going back to
germany to be surrendered a mere re-
construction on my part i know noth-
ing definite

   jan asked raising her eyes to the keen
but almost childish face

   what does the piece of mica stand
for finn maccocl i know was one
of the old irish giants who was supposed
to have buried a crock of gold among the
hills

   was he that was a nice fancy of the
man who etched the map even if he was
a german perhaps he did hide some-
thing there if he did he must have
fetched it -long ago-unless of course he
died

   was it erich schumann

   schumann was nine years old when
that was made but he knew about it
so does camilla

   she wants it of course its a kind
of clue i suppose

   shes more or less prepared to kill
for it poor creature she has hopes that
shell get allenby tc help her    now
well put the thing back

   but the gold or whatever it is cant
be there yet

  gold turning from the mantel
jethro cobb rubbed his cheek why
do you- oh i see that newspaper-clip-
ping in schumanns writing-case better
burn the whole thing no its unlikely
that the pirates hoard is there now ifit
ever was but camilla means to make
sure

   why dont you get it yourself
theres an obstinate streak in you
youll be asking next how i know all
these things    im a rich man my
hobby is human behaviorism i spent
five years buried away from my fellow-
creatures and im making up for it now
besides im sure your finn maccools
crock of gold must have been lifted long
ago he looked at the clock its get-
ting late ive kept you here too long
in that pretty dressing-gown miss fev-
ersham

   you want me to keep all this secret
i know you will he took her hand
and bent over it a perhaps that irish
gentleman and great sinner murtag of
cashel murtag would have done well
study the other four people now you and
i but watch camilla

for nearly three days a drizzle of rain
had enveloped cashel murtag an at-
lantic rain that beat in with soft per-
sistence and kept jethro cobbs guests in-
doors messrs catchpole and wackett
fed well and drank well cheated each
other at cards and entirely recovered
from their discomfiture during that


the submarines treasure

time jan found herself playing billiards
with camilla and fell as glad as a school-
girl that she could p ay rings round her
when craig allenby watched them the
radio spoke of sinkings and the war at
sea the world shook but it all seemed
far away from sinners castle

  on the third night when jan went to
bed the sky had cleared to a field of stars
that stippled the water outside the air
was very clear when she sat at her win-
dow and looked down the lough with
a pair of small but good binoculars it
was almost possible to see the breakers
outside the mouth but presently she
tired and went to bed camilla had
come upstairs before her but an hour
later to her sleepy surprise jan heard a
step on the loose board outside the door
as she went to her room

  darn camilla she thought

  but all the same her door was care-
fully locked

the morning was bright with sun-
shine saddleback pat rising out of
blackadders bog had a ring of white
cloud round his forehead when she
looked out jan trained her glasses on
his scarred sides for some trace of a pos-
sible cave where a fortune in gold bars
might be hidden under the mildew of
twenty-one years then laughed at herself
she changed direction and found some-
thing much more interesting a slim
tweed-clad figure moved leisurely along
the distant shore of the lough dwindling
slowly it was camilla

  camilla had an early breakfast and
went out to look for submarines she
said craig allenby told her when she
went down

  its a great morning said jan try-
ing not to let her look linger on him i
think ill take the little sailing curragh
out ill cry kameradv if any u-boat
rises

  when she reached the little boathouse
half an hour later he wasalready there
sitting at the tiller under the brown lug
of the curragh  camillas left him be-
hind so ill do thought jan forlornly
yet had camilla been beating at a stone
wall after all she had taken the tiller
from him and he was watching her firm
strong hand on it as the curragh heeled
over

  i misjudged you he said all at once
there was something queer about that
suicide business-to refer to another ex-
istence it wasnt what it seemed youd
never do a thing like that

  thanks she answered laconically
she never meant to tell him he must
find out for himself then i never
even tried to judge you it wasnt my
business i wonder why camilla didnt
take you with her just now

  i didnt want to go    what were
you doing by that car that evening
mr cobb will tell you if he thinks
fit

  cobb he looked at her for a long
time while the curragh danced over the
green waves hes several years under
fifty thats true    look at those mack-
erel well trail a line

  jan nearly laughed as he consigned
her to jethro cobb and threw out a line
astern but she said

  you ought to have stayed in london
and proved that somebody else killed that
uncle of yours instead of just becoming
one of jethro cobbs specimens if it
comes to candid speaking though i
suppose it might be difficult at the be-
ginning of a war and now having both
broken the ice so to speak wed better
go on with the fishing

  but she let craig pull in the silvery
fish which he did in silence now and
then jan put the small binoculars to her
eyes and thought she saw a brown speck
moving against the green woods and pur-
ple heather of the shore the lough be-
gan to widen there to a lonely space of
blue water they trawled to and fro
for two hours and more in that ocean
inlet of ireland which was so remote
from human life even now when the seas
outside it held lurking death and the
eye of a periscope might be watching
them

  then craig allenbys eyes crinkled in
a way jan had noticed long before

  you shall taste fresh mackerel grilled
on a wood fire he promised her
theyre good

on a pebbly beach under a low brown
cliff they ran the curragh and went
ashore looking back they could see the
fluttering speck of jethro cobbs flag and
hear the faint chime of the clock at sin-
ners castle though it was fully half a
dozen miles away when the fire of
branches and driftwood was crackling
jan said

  i dont want to see you operate on the
poor things ill take a look around
somewhere not far away was camilla
jan had seen her with those precious lit-
tle binoculars seen her look at the dis-
tant curragh and then slip inland either


the blue book magazine

by chance or design camilla seemed to
be gypsying all alone with the salt
wind blowing about her jan reached the
brow of the low cliff she took out her
compact and repaired her complexion
an operation that would appeal to ca-
milla if she were anywhere near and sus-
picious of being watched half a mile
away a flock of wood-pigeons flew sud-
denly out of the trees

  jan began to crawl through the thicket
on all fours after a time when all her
joints began to ache the stub of a ciga-
rette still smoking gave her hope it
seemed an hour before she was in the
depth of the wood proper her trousers
torn and muddy and her skin scratched
the glasses jumped before her eyes but
she could see camilla there in the green
twilight approaching a tall bearded
man wrapped in a stained blue navy coat
and sweater-a man who was hatless and
wet and sagged a little as though from
exhaustion as he came forward to meet
her

  a magpie flew chattering from jan
where she crawled yard by yard on her
stomach now close to where the two peo-
ple had seated themselves on a tree-trunk
it was uncomfortable because it made
her heart thump against the ground but
at last she could hear them talking lying
within a few yards of them the man
spoke in careful and correct english as
he huddled in his wet clothes

  we came in the night before last
when it was as black as pitch after sink-
ing a big boat a hundred miles out ah
yes his white teeth gleamed momen-
tarily through his beard i had that
much of this war we lay on the sur-
face charging the batteries it was weird
to hear the clock striking and to know
there was someone at the castle in the
darkness i stepped off it was an acci-
dent you understand karl my son and
erichs cousin-yes i had the honor to
serve under my own son a better nazi
than myself-looked for me in the boat
for an hour poor lad i watched him
from the shore he is a first-class navi-
gator however and he will carry on
naturally one of the unterseekinder
schumanns would not leave his boat in
the lurch altogether

camilla said quickly i saw the
flare you lit last night though it
was a bit risky we cant stay here long
conrad theres a small boat on the
lough with a man and a girl from the
castle ill tell you about them later

  the man laughed though he seemed
surprised

  a man and a girl i expected only
erich not even you camilla natu-
rally i shall be glad to have a warm fire
and a good meal afier hiding in this bar-
barous wood i am not so young two
wars it is one at least too many in the
sea-coffin service but i volunteered as
soon as it seemed inevitable naturally
erich isovith you

  no    qonrac he died he feared
internment

he stiffened but he had lived with
death too long for it to be anything
more than an incident in a mans life
he had auout him the same mixture of
brute and child which jan had always
noticed in erich schumann his eyes
red-rimmed pierced camilla then the
torpedo beard went up almost gayly

  so poor erich i will ask no ques-
tions camilla i am too thankftd to find
a friend at the old irish castle

  you were a fool not to come and lake
away the stuff in peace-time conrad
thats what surprises me

  he pondered it shivering for he was
soaked perhaps so but it would have
meant living in exile in germany ae
state wotdd have taken it-even in the
early days it would have been impos-
sible to hide it w hen the fuhrer rose
the schumanns would have made me give
the gold to him with both hands they
are all very good nazis very great pa-
triots so am i when i remember and
then again i lost the clue-the metal
map i made i lost it one time i came
to visit you and erich herr gott i
cast up nothing never did i trust erich
no doubt you have it here with you
you were always cleverer than he

  it isnt necessary you could walk to
the place

  and fall into the bog or over a preci-
pice or search for days and days with-
out ever finding it always falling into
that damned bog that frightened me
more than any depth-charge ever did for
we got lost the whole night on our way
back and lay not daring to stay for fear
of being sucked in i swear the banshees
were thrusting at us with invisible fingers
never shall i forget it no we need the
metal map and the bearings the grass
will have grown on it the stones will
have fallen on the cave in these sav-
age mountains the landscape changes
that was why we took a note of the bear-
ing by the sun of the exact spot and


the submarines treasure

screwed it inside the metal map it was
childish conrad ended musingly but
it was half a joke we were certain we
would never get home the british fleet
were beating us up we lay on the bot-
tom of the sea crazy and weak with foul
air and i copied that map with the engi-
neers needle to pass the time nor did
we get home-except me i had the
schumann luck when we were bombed
into scrap-iron by one of our own de-
stroyers outside heligoland how long
ago it seems and rrfow i am here again
camilla spoke urgently

  im better than erich conrad i
read that code radiogram you sent to him
saying you woidd come to cashel murtag
the first few days if war broke out oh
i know your nerve isnt what it was
youre well over forty youre fed up with
nazi germany and the submarine service
in spite of being a schumann and you
dont see why you shouldnt enjoy a bit
of life after this wars over nazi or not
charming camilla he bit his lip
and bowed in ironical prussian fashion
it is a pity you are my niece there is
some man at the castle

  four of them and a girl guests of
a man called jethro cobb who bought
tle castle and furnished it hes not
quite human i dont know how lie got
hold of your metal map but i know he
has it thats why i came here as one
of his guests

  we must get it from him it is a long
way to come for nothing even yet it
seems a dream

it isnt-its real now i must go
his bloodshot eyes narrowed a little
and i follow and give myself up as a
prisoner of war to this mr jethro cobb
is that it

  he wont make you a prisoner ire-
land isnt at war hell treat you as a
guest youre lieutenant conrad of the
german navy your u-boat lay in the
lough last night and you were very glad
to swim ashore and be out of the war
again charming you make me feel
so big as big as when almost for a
joke we carried the gold bricks up the
mountain in  so very drunk with
brandy and defeat that we scarcely re-
membered it next day but-very good
i will come and play my part

jan lying as close as a red indian to
the ground tensed to spring up and
shout for craig allenbys help because
it seemed as though camilla would stum-
ble over her as she left the wood but a

moment later camillas brogues flipped
past her and were gone without touching
her meanwhile conrad on the tree-trunk
was draining what remained of a small
brandy flask it was easy to guess that
this unterseekind schumann long past
the age for his grim and nerve-racking
job had only been able to sustain it from
the bottle he was probably the weak
brother of the family now whatever he
had once been his glance went nervous-
ly through the trees and beyond the head-
land to the glittering atlantic as though
a periscope might break the water and
reveal the coward and deserter sitting
there    jan crawling away cautiously
was haunted by the picture he made

still she was determined about one
thing she meant not to breathe a
word of what she had seen and heard to
craig allenby he kept everything from
her he told her nothing about his own
affairs very likely he was still fascinated
by camilla her flesh tingled at that
thought more than at what had hap-
pened in the last quarter of an hour but
she laughed lightly when she scrambled
down to the beach where he sat over the
blue smoke of the fire

  its thrilling she said like a can-
nibal island except there arent any
cannibals i got badly bushed look
at my trousers

  didnt see camilla anywhere with
those glasses of yours i expect

talking about cannibals noi
you dont like her smiling slight-
ly he took the savory fish from the white
ash of the fire and handed it to her on
a flat stone

  and you do

  heavens youre nearly as big a puri-
tan as cobb he said cynically dont
be this is only a short if hectic chapter
in all our lives let us eat drink and
be merry for tomorrow we die-one or
more of us according to cobbs private
theory fish good

  delicious said jan swallowing the
big lump in her throat

  later as the curragh rippled its way
down the lough jan closed her eyes to
shut out craig as much as anything
but also to picture a big black submarine
and a man stepping into the water under
cover of night leaving his steely fanati-
cal companions behind when she un-
closed her lashes craig was watching her
he was friendly and he liked her well
enough but camilla was stronger meat
if only because she was a dangerous wom-

the blue book magazine

an and danger held a rather fearful fas-
cination at sinners castle jan herself
felt its influence like the edge of a knife
that slid across her skin without break-
ing it-yet she could not deny that
she got some exhilaration out of it

chapter four

the exhilaration was there two days
afterward when lieutenant conrad
of the german u-boat service leaned easi-
ly in a deck-chair on the terrace of cash-
el murtag with a cigar tilted between his
bearded lips and put a long finger
through the rings he blew while he
shrugged an answer to a question from
wackett-who this morning wore a red
tie with polka dots and smoked a large
curved pipe catchpole in another seat
listened with his hands clasped good
feeding and a sun-reddened nose im-
parted a contented piglike look to the
erstwhile clergyman

  it was a terrible blow to think we
were at war with englishmen like your-
self mr wackett quiet capable men
who never let go boys of the bulldog
breed as your song says yes i am glad
to be out of it

  you were gutsy though conceded
wackett lying in a sardine-can at the
bottom of the sea breathing your own
breath with jack johnsons dropping
around you  i couldnt have done
it wouldnt be surprised if it was you
sunk the athenia

  i wouldnt be surprised but let us
not talk of it

  too terrible murmured catchpole
somnolently but his small eyes roved
over the german

  conrad rose and clicked his heels as
jethro cobb appeared he was very
grateful and charming to everybody like
a bearded boy-but a boy who would
stone a cat or tie an old woman down in
bed if it amused him jan thought he
and camilla talked like strangers getting
to know each other to jethro cobb
he was one gentleman to another only
when he had half-finished the decanter
did a tiny mocking gleam come into his
eyes

  i dont want the decanter to precipi-
tate matters cobb had told jan i
want everything to happen cold sober
here

  he had listened without visible emo-
tion when she told him what she had
seen and heard in the wood by the head-

land his wistful look seemed to take
her in rather than her sensational story
nothing surprised him visibly    she
watched him now talking with his eager
boyish smile to conrad and wondered
with a queer kind of anger whether he
had merely roped the man in as another
psychological specimen and had forgot-
ten the deadly combination he made
with camilla schumann

  somebody with a name like obrien
oflaherty oflynri walled up his wife
in one of theold towers ive just read in a
book in the library camilla was saying
the bloodstains where she beat herself
to death are supposed to be still there
they wouldnt wipe out i want to find
the grisly spot coming craig
sure

  jan watched camilla walk away with
craig the sun had made her silky skin
like a peach while jan according to her
mirror had merely grown olive and
brown-eyed and frec kled she was more
like a strong slim boy from the donegal
mountains that rose against the blue sky
across the lough than anything else all
the same she was a woman and not a
panther

  miss feversham-conrad broke in
on her thoughts-will you show rffe
this place where the irishman so per-
fectly solved his domestic problems
the old celtic ruins were scattered
by the lough shore there was the gray
skeleton of a tower and a few crumbled
walls with ivy that ruffled in the wind
when the gales blew today a stiff breeze
blew through the soft irish sunshine
camilla leaned close against craig al-
lenby within the dimness of the tower
her fingers were linked in his they
looked like two people who had come to
a romantic understanding-if a thing like
that could be called romantic jan told
herself between her closed teeth

camilla released herself with a mis-
chievous glance

  all right jan ill be guide and take
lieutenant conrad up the steps theres
only room for two at a time ill take
you up after

  you wont thought jan looking up
to the crumbled steps where a false step
would have meant a broken neck she
took a cigarette from the case craig al-
lenby handed her and lit it

  i dont believe you like lieutenant
conrad much she said of course
hes an enemy subject and a nazi but
he must be a brave man


the submarines treasure

  he frowned at her suddenly ignoring
the statement

  jan why dont you go away from
here is it because cobbs fond of you
because he is

  she found herself answering i know
that though the idea startled her it
seemed ludicrous to picture jethro cobb
fond of any woman

  hes obsessed by this psychological
idea you ought to get him to shut up
this shop

  what would become of you and ca-
milla

  hello puritanl he said lightly i
can feel you fingering my soul- leave
it alone will you

so you admit shes bad for the soul
he looked at her inscrutably the
light from the blue sl y which came down
from the roofless summit of the tower
cut his features strongly

  shes a beautiful devil but men like
em sometimes its a fairly good pair-
ing-off if the little men who do that sort
of thing are working on this bit of irish
soil camilla and me cobb and you
but cobb would want to marry you ca-
millas not particular that suits me
he turned away having spoken with
a certain brutal frankness which he
seemed to make deliberate what hap-
pened then came very quickly allenby
looked up at some sound-and shoved
jan aside as a mass of heavy stone came
falling down thudding on the spot where
they had both been standing a second
before leaning aga inst the rough wall
jans thought snapped for a lightning
instant this is a development she
tried to get him that time as well as
me the debris still went on falling
from above allenby caught her up with
an oath but there was warm blood on
her forehead from a fragment that had
struck her and she realized with a light-
headed clearness that her senses were leav-
ing her   

  when she recovered a few minutes lat-
er she was lying on a deep couch in the

cool blue shadows of the small library
with jethro cobb in a low wexford chair
watching her

  all right it was a rather narrow es-
cape you got a glancing scalp blow
-but from a fairly small stone

  jan sipped the cup of tea he handed to
her it was laced with something that
stopped her hand from trembling after a
minute or two and made her feel calm
and almost matter-of-fact

i was behind you and allenby cobb
jl said i thought it advisable to
come along conrad slipped and dis-
lodged a bit of the masonry and he
nearly came down himself in a pains-
taking attempt to make it look acciden-
tal    oh no allenby wasnt hurt
he carried you here i got rather a crack
on the hand myself

  you they meant to get all three of
us then

  well perhaps but it was a tall or-
der even if theyd loosened things up
there beforehand im not sure they saw
me though they want that precious
metal map out of me before they do any-
thing drastic i imagine

  jan passed her hand across her fore-
head

  i just dont understand why camilla
should want to kill craig allenby i
thought--

  cobb nodded understandingly

  yes so she was until lieutenant con-
rad appeared on the scene not that
shes transferred her affections but con-
rad is an accomplice ready-made i think
she believed at first that allenby really
murdered his uncle and so might be
good material to work on shell man-
age to persuade him that it was an ac-
cident i expect is he very infatuated
jan nodded because she flinched from
answering aloud remembering allenbys
words shes a beautiful devil but men
like em sometimes and she must
leave his soul alone craig had told her
well it was his own she sat up her


the blue book magazine

head feeling no more than a little swim-
my jethro cobb was standing by the
big fireplace his white head and clean-
cut face etched against the black panel-
ing his hands rubbing a little nervous-
ly together

  i wonder you dont give them that
metal map jan said if you dont want
it yourself this is all horribly danger-
ous for you theyll drag catchpole and
wackett in if they havent already done
so remember youve made those two
hate you    wouldnt they have a task
to get the gold away if its still there
theyd bring it down here and put it
into ordinary packing-cases and a little
coasting-steamer could call in for them
dont forget there are a number of un-
balanced ira people who would be
pleased to help a foreign tramp or two
still looks in at galway camilla would
make a brilliant figure in mentone or
somewhere with half a million in gold
that was erich schumanns plan for him-
self at any rate

  he spoke almost absently his intense
blue eyes still upon her the gold among
the hills finn maccools crock of gold
seemed to be part of his experiment to
him but he was not thinking of that at
the moment he was thinking of herself
jan knew

  while were here they cant do it
unless i help them conrad wont go
without the map and his bearings hes
scared stiff of getting lost the mans
neurotic with drink and nerve-strain
not that they havent had a good game
of hunt-the-slipper for the map already
if i gave it to them we might get short
shrift    now i want to talk about
something else i have some news about
your sister kate

  an jumped involuntarily and gasped
  about-

  about kate jethro cobb repeated
mildly its absurd but i have a tele-
phone here it was costly because it
goes under the lough and across the hills
to the telegraph-station twenty miles dis-
tant and the deer break the wires every
now and again however there isnt a
trace of it about the house well i got
in touch with a private-inquiry man i
know kate is singing in a cabaret
quite a respectable one shes also very
friendly with a young fellow of good
family and not too much brain a mr
bert twistleton

  he owns the shooting round twelve-
trees jan laughed a bit unsteadily

kate called him the blue spaniel it
was something about his nose hes
harmless it was very very good of you
mr cobb

  so that was kate kate as usual had
made a good landing jan felt very glad
and a bit envious of kates unfailing
luck

  i want to be good to you cobb said
i wonder if youd do me the honor to
marry me its sudden i know but i
wish youd tink it over

he stood outside the bar of sunshine
that streamed through the window
as though he were afraid of her seeing
him he had spoken in his normal voice
which was always a little wistfully eager
jan knew quite well that she had heard
aright though perhaps she ought to have
doubted it she stood up beginning to
shake her head quite touchingly he
began to plead but still kept in the
shadow

  im neither so eld nor so cracked as
i seem he said im a lonely man and
women have always gone on the other
side of my street i was glad of it-but
youre different im dull but id make
a good comrade

i wouldnt call you dull jan sad
slowly it hasnt been a dull time here
just your promise thats all if you
ever went back on it i wouldnt try to
hold you against your will

  im not a chicken myself thought
jan twenty-seven next birthday craig
allenbys weak contemptible hell hate
me if i try to save him from camilla any
more no more struggling at twelve-
trees if i ever get back there besides
i like him and im beginning to hate
craig allenby

  it is rather unexpected she said she
smiled he was so like a shy boy quiet
and slightly crippled but brilliant of in-
tellect

  but youll give me your promise
he took her hand with a sharp intake
of breath thank you my dear

i want to make a condition jan
said i want us to go away from sin-
ners castle the games too dangerous
he lifted his small finely sculptured
head

  for me you mean leaving the crock
of gold for camilla and conrad and
messrs wackett and catchpole to squab-
ble over

  and craig allenby-though i dont
believe theres any crock of gold its all
too wild but if the brantane came and


the submarines treasure

you shut up sinners castle theyd have

to come

  true he said thoughtfully then
youre excited

  there was color in her face why
shouldnt camilla and craig allenby
know

  perhaps we might have a sort of lit-
tle celebration-party he said as though
he read her thoughts she began in or-
der to hide her confusion

  camilla might-

  try to make it a poison-party no
that attempt on her husband really
frightened her i think shes bad to
the core and quite rcckless if she was
latin she might have used the idea
again but i think she- was probably glad
to leave her poison behind

  when he opened the door for her she
remembered that he hadnt agreed to
leave sinners castle he was like some
leprechaun who meant to heap kindness
upon her but could not part with his
iron will when the sea-air in the big
hall blew upon her she felt as though
she came up from a magic underground
where he had persuaded her just as he
pleased and left her changed belonging
towhim the five oiher guests of sin-
ners castle were all waiting there

  miss feversham was only slightly
hurt said jethro cobb i hope you
will congratulate me she has prom-
ised to be my wife

  congratulations and best wishes
said craig allenby

  his eyes met jans searchingly mak-
ing her feel weak for a moment and then
with a warm laugh camilla came forward
an astonishing impulse to strike her in
the face with all the force of which jan
was capable needed a lot of beating
down it proved to jan that perhaps her
nerve was a trifle bro-cen

  thanks everybody for mr wack-
ett with his mouth pulled in a grin
catchpole like the shabby vicar of some
parish where sin still flourished in spite
of his efforts lieutenant conrad his
heels together and his eyes bright-all
were gathered about her but i think
ill lie down a bit

the staircase seemed long and tir-
ing her room was very quiet as if
the rather sinister peace of the moun-
tains about sinners castle came down in-
to it a faint haze lay over the lough

  well she could be mistress of cashel
murtag whenever she liked if she and
jethro cobb were not murdered before

it was strange how little she could en-
vision that cache on saddleback pat how
unreal it seemed so was the war unreal
at sinners castle though out at sea it
was going on in grim earnest

  she ought to lie down and forget craig
allenby but didnt he understand that
both camilla and conrad had tried to

kill him no he was too infatuated

  mrs jethro cobb

  no that woiddnt come real either
the clock in the tower chimed and made
her start as it always did a flock of
sheldrake scuttered across the distant
water more than once of late she had
watched the wild life of the lough
through her small binoculars because
that seemed real and eternal it an-
chored her to earth dipping into the
smooth surface the birds faded away into
the haze nothing stirred it was like
a dull mirror

and then just as jan was putting
l down the glasses before taking off
her shoes for she really was shaken
something broke the surface it moved
tpiietly leaving a rippling v behind it
then without hurry disappeared

  it was the periscope of a submarine
jan lowered the glasses as the field of
vision went empty and remained so she
put them quietly away her sense of un-
reality had all gone now the far-away
war had come to sinners castle and out
in the deep waters of the lough within
two miles a submarine lay lurking it
could only be a u-boat-the same craft
from which conrad schumann of the
unterseekinder schumanns had deserted
from his sons command and come ashore
out of her hidden pirate-beat in the at-
lantic where hunting and hunted she
played ball with death she had come
back into that lonely inlet for what

  that steely instrument of destruction
slumbering a hundred feet below water
perhaps gave jan no sense of real peril
though with its guns it could easily blow
sinners castle from the rock which held
it nobody was likely to have glimpsed
the periscope besides herself it was like
knowing the secret of some sea-monster
that basked out there

  she bathed her temples and felt fresher
her wealthy fiance mr jethro cobb
wotdd like her to take care of her looks
no doubt a shadow of a dimple came
into her cheek then went away    as
she finished at the mirror five minutes
later a knock sounded on the door

  its i jan said camillas voice
the blue book magazine

  she opened the door feeling all at once
much more powerful than camilla with
all the secrets she held the woman
stepped in quickly closing the door be-
hind her she walked to a chair and sat
down

  youre pretty plucky jan i must say
she said without any preface you
frighten me just a wee bit how do i
affect you

  im not sure replied jan looking
into the limpid green eyes but i
think you cant be very clever missing
twice if thats what youre referring to
not as clever as you your quaint
fiance must be worth half a million
i shant try again now i dont think
thanks for cutting the cackle    ive
come to lay my cards on the table now
you are somebody here first im pen-
niless catchpole and wackett would
have got about twenty pounds for my jew-
els-theyre paste so im rather des-
perate add to that im a pagan id
rather die than be poor i mean that
quite literally

  jan sat down it was almost the first
time she had believed any word of ca-
milla schumanns she was completely
reckless rather than subtle or clever

  erich got no neairer to that crock of
gold as conrad calls it than the original
contour map you took from my room
conrads family name is schumann as
youve either guessed or known all the
time he copied the map on part of a
torpedo-fin im-

  i know about that too

  it was stolen from conrad conrads
run to seed you know well erich be-
lieved that jethro cobb had it and knew
about the gold and he arranged with
conrad to come to sinners castle if war
happened its true i tried to poison
erich because i wanted to be free of
him and come here myself it was-a sort
of adventure and youll never know the
kind of man erich was    there wasnt
any need for it because scotland yard
was on his track

 wonder why youre telling me
 this jans voice was hard

  im coming to that i got jethro cobb
to invite me on his yachting trip because
i knew hed bought sinners castle hes
a kind of miser camillas voice took on
a slow hatred he wont touch it he
gloats over it where it is because hes rich
enough thats one reason why i hate
him so you ought to get him to make
a will in your favor jan

  because conrad wants to kill him
is that it

  i tell you i dont dare said camilla
fiercely neither does conrad were
both of us desperate people weve
reached a philosophy you wouldnt un-
derstand conrads chiefly afraid of one
thing and thats getting lost on saddle-
back pat hes superstitious like a lot
of nazis hitler has an astrologer hasnt
he get that metal map for us jan
jan lit a cigarette camilla watched
her like a snake a snake which hesitated
to strike she felt a moment of triumph
outside on the lough the haze was thick-
ening the water heavy and still like mer-
cury above the skulking thing it held

  in return ill give up craig allenby
said camilla give us the map and
take them both away with you

this time jan struck she could not
help it the blow she gave with
her clenched fist sent camilla schumann
reeling back a step and left a red patch
on her white cheek the green eyes
flared but were frightened camilla
stood against the wall staring while jan
opened the door and gestured her to it

  that was my answer she saisj
dont try any woman-to-woman talk
again

  it was good to feel her knuckles tin-
gling for fully a quarter of an hour after
and to find even when dusk came that a
tiny scratch remained on them where
they had touched camillas teeth the
night promised to be black and heavy
and when jan stood with jethro cobb
in the garden by the water-edge before
dinner she forgot camilla and felt a
thrill of foreboding run through her
had the sight of the periscope been an
illusion on her part after all she won-
dered for all the excitement jethro
cobb showed when she told him aboirt
it it might have been and yet his eyes
glanced over the water with a grave
luminance jan did not want to stay out
for long somehow she did not wish to
think of that inhuman thing with its
young ultimately doomed human cargo
hiding there till it should go out and
prey again

  conrads been tanking-up all day
poor devil said cobb i dont envy
camilla her partner i wonder what
that young submarine-commander son of
his would say if he could see him some-
thing may happen at dinner youre not
nervous he touched her hand mo-
mentarily allenbys got his eyes open
the submarines treasure

  craig allenby smiled formally at her
as she sat with cobb at the head of the
table in the small banqueting-hall when
early darkness had dropped like a man-
tle over sinners castle the irish couple
and whatever mysterious menials they
had in the kitchen provided an excel-
lent dinner it was camilla who with
eyes like stars toasted the happy couple
it was mr wackett who joined in elo-
quently it isnt real thought jan
nobody believes in it neither do i
perhaps craig does if he does thats all
that matters

  it is like one of our farewell parties
at kiel said conrad schumann there
is always a betrothal or more often a
wedding sometimes several it makes
for a lot of widows unfortunately my
son karl was betrothed before he left
a very charming girl

  there was a red spot on each of con-
rads cheekbones in one of allenbys
dress-suits he looked more like a disso-
lute yet attractive artist than a u-boat
officer his eyes were gay but haunted
and he drank deeply it suddenly struck
jan that both catchpole and wackett
were watching him intently as though
expectant of something and willing to be
ffither spectators or sharers in the game
outside the wind was rising a little
and the full tide slapped on the rocks

  up on saddleback pat said conrad
schumann abruptly it will be a dirty
night

  camillas fingers curled over and
clenched

  youre drinking- too much tonight
lieutenant she said in a low voice

but the two pairs of eyes conrads
and jethro cobbs were fixed upon
each other across the table in the si-
lence cobb said

  the banshees wi  be crying up there
   itll be a dirty night out at sea too
lieutenant

  camilla whispered jeu tool and
made a restraining movement to conrad
schumann-but too late into the ger-
mans hand sprang a small luger pistol
he balanced it in his palm

  i would avenge the insult you mean
for me if i had any right to herr cobb
he said and if tlere was not more im-
portant business on hand please sit
still everybody i give you my friend
cobb two minutes in which to produce
a certain map engraved on metal of this
part of ireland as god in heaven is my
judge i shall shoot you if you refuse

 so you admit to that judge said
jethro cobb why your hands shak-
ing man

  the map said conrad be silent
camilla

  im only trying to say said camilla
deadly white but smiling that since
youve precipitated matters youd better
hold miss feversham as hostage and
draw a bead on her while he fetches it

from the blue glint of the gun in
conrads hand after what seemed a
long interval during which cobb did
not seem to move jans glance passed
to catchpole and wackett they sat
quite still also both grinning faintly
which meant that they were in this to
however limited a degree it was per-
haps not true that she had known some-
thing like it would happen but it was
not entirely unexpected jethro cobb
began cracking a walnut with his fingers
she thought hes quite likely to have
the cartridges out of the pistol

  there was a crash as craig allenby
acted the movements he made were
beautifully coordinated and swift as
lightning his right hand pinned the
luger to the table his left smashed into
conrads clipped beard and lifted him
from the chair to the floor with the
pistol in his pocket he turned

  shall we stop all this fooling he
asked and it was jan he addressed

  he went close to her and jethro cobb
she began to feel her heart thrumming
as he spoke exclusively to her again

  id like you to come away from here
with me as soon as its daylight he said
id like to ask you when were alone
but cobb ought to hear he does most
of his own performances in public
whether he releases you or not i want
you to leave this place with me before
this woman kills you and gives him some
notes for his psychological experiment
i cant murmured jan her eyes
were wide as she saw him turn to camil-
la she grew light-headed because his
smile was one of genuine amusement
mingled with contempt

my apologies camilla he said
why camilla asked huskily her
glance glided to conrad where he leaned
dazedly on the back of a chair but it
came back to craig

  i hardly know how to put it taking
you in-basely deceiving a beautiful and
charming woman theres something
about you you know and yet there
isnt youre unlucky with men even con-

the blue book magazine

rad here itll lead you to a quarter i
know something about myself but you
may not be as fortunate as i was jan
cant you see it was because i suspected
her from the beginning because i wanted
to keep a watch on the woman

  through jan who was only human
passed a delicious joy the womanl
as though blonde camilla were some
wretched creature caught in shoplifting
yet it was all too late as she well knew
cobbs clenched hand lay on the table
this isnt playing the game allenby
he said

  jan will you come

  no she answered i wont come
please sit down craig

after a few seconds he obeyed his
l eyes still smoldering at her and at
jethro cobb it was a strange dinner-
table now that the softened lamps of
sinners castle shone upon closed in by
the darkness of mountain and sea beyond
the curtains conrad schumann sprawled
with a hand on the decanter his bearded
chin on his chest camilla sat with a
wide fixed smile that took in craig al-
lenby and ignored the other man mr
wackett made a move to rise delicately
from the table but was pulled down
again by a pasty-faced catchpole whose
glance was fixed on craig allenbys
pocket

  presently jethro cobb rose to his feet
helped jan to hers he smiled gravely

  i would apologize for this scene he
said if i knew whom to apologize to
but the dinner itself was enjoyable mr
wackett

  lush admitted mr wackett some-
what hoarsely but look here-

  say no more mr wackett lieuten-
ant conrad was obviously drunk and
harking back to his student days at
heidelberg hes a man with a load of
trouble too

  cobbs fine face held a faint strain
when the group went into the room

he called the library he glanced at the
clock and listened to the wind behind
the curtains and jan heard him make a
sound that was like a cut-off sigh he
looked at neither conrad nor camilla
but drew one of theheavy curtains and
stood looking out both he and jan had
heard a low but peremptory knock at the
door

  i fear the nights excitements are not
all over cobb said i think we have
visitors he spoke in a louder voice
that suddenly held a touch of compas-
sion we have visitors lieutenant con-
rad

  it sent through jan a thrill of com-
plete sickness because she guessed who
was there conrad raised his head as
cobb addressed him and then the door
of the room opened to admit the irish
butler pale and startled behind him
were three men they were unshaven
and hollow-eyed and the odor of oil
clung to them but the full german naval
uniform each wore was spick and span
as though specially donned for an occa-
sion of ceremony the foremost a boy
hardly out of his teens it seemed wore
a sword his epaulettes creaked faintly
as he saluted after one glance round the
room which took in conrad and rested
on him

  there is no occasion to be alarmed
he said you are all quite safe and will
not be hurt we come only for a de-
serter -lieutenant schumann atten-
tion

  slowly conrad schumann levered him-
self up and stood upright the boy
made a gesture to the other two officers
and they stepped to his side the boy
bowed slightly to jethro cobb his lean
face set like a mask

  i thank you for your hospitality to
lieutenant schumann sir he said i
thank you on behalf of myself and of the
german navy though we are now ene-
mies it is not to be thought that we
have intruded for a trifle that we should
the submarines treasure

not be glad to be rid of a coward instead
of taking the trouble to find him and
execute sentence but lieutenant schu-
mann belongs to a very famous family of
german navy people whose discipline
is very strict i have the honor to be-
long to that family  have the dishonor
to be lieutenant schumanns son

  jethro cobb said will you partake of
my hospitality too while youre here
commander schumann if the business is
not too urgent youre very welcome
the boys glance went longingly round
the warmly-lit room one saw the crav-
ing for brief comfort and safety that lay
in his eyes he was very like conrad
and not unlike erich schumann save for
the iron and inhuman strength forged
from some fanatic furnace and stamped
by his upbringing which carved every
feature

  i am sorry i would like to but no
we must get aboard and leave these dan-
gerous waters it is so necessary not to
swerve from ones purpose also -are
you ready lieutenant schumann

  conrad with a twisted smile broke the
silence for the first time speaking in
german

  a revolver in the hand karl or a
firing-party

  there will be a court lieutenant
schumann the boy said speaking pre-
cisely in english out of his metallic
courtesy lieutenant bohm-karnfeld
under-lieutenant brautsch and myself it
is not to be discussed before enemy civil-
ians again he bowed and said earnest-
ly believe me there are not many
such cowards and soft men in our sub-
marine service nor in yours it is a
hard life men break under it but this
one did not he was broken to begin
with

  its strange that you found your way
into this lough herr commander said
jethro cobb it was almost as though
he wished to detain the little party of
stiff and pitiless young men a bit longer

karl schumann smiled back at

him bleakly

  that also is not to be discussed sir

it was charted by lieutenant schumann

it will form the subject of the inquiry
rest assured sir that justice is always
done in the german navy

  then give me the revolver now
karl said conrad schumann and
get out of this -have no fear cobb

i promise to make a clean job of it on the
terrace and drop into the water



  i do not trust you lieutenant schu-
mann said commander schumann icily

  there was something terrible about
the two men father and son as they
looked at each other and conrad cold
sober now braced his shoulders with the
twitch of a smile he was a big man
bigger than the younger of the unter-
seekinder schumanns who made a last
bow and marched toward the door but
there the boy turned the steely calm
fled from him for one instant

  it is not that i have no emotions
sir he said but i do not belong to
myself it is the discipline always
since i was a child i was trained in it
lieutenant schumann is of another gen-
eration it is to be regretted but he
was a good sailor his voice fell yes
he was once a good sailor and now we
will go thanking you will you all
please not move from here for a quarter
of an hour it will be dangerous to do
otherwise

the business was ended a draft of air
came into the room and the front
door closed the footsteps of the four
men died away as they crunched audibly
down the garden the clink of the de-
canter against a glass as wackett me-
chanically helped himself sounded sharp
camilla was twisting a handkerchief in
her hand and she looked for the first
time cornered and at a loss

  poor young brutes cobb said softly
he seemed to be listening for some-
thing he looked old and stern and as
his hand rested on jans something
seemed to tell her that his thoughts were
not in that room not at sinners castle
at all but out in the windy night the
drama was not finished she whispered
because it seemed impossible to use nor-
mal tones in the electric strain

  it was ghastly that boy-

  jethro cobb speaking as low said
listen my dear i sent a phone message
to the telegraph-station an hour ago
the radio of every destroyer within a
hundred miles will have it theyre
trapped its war we shall get a letter
of thanks from the admiralty but i feel
like a murderer

  its war said jan with shaking lips
nobody can run away from it wherever
they go

  she felt it to be an eternity since that
dinner to celebrate the engagement of
jethro cobb and herself had started
the time-factor at sinners castle did
not seem to function as it did anywhere
the blue book magazine

else and though it was only a minute or
two by the clock since the u-boat officers
had taken away their prisoner and they
could hardly have yet reached their
launch at the landing it seemed to be
much longer cobbs finger on her hand
tightened there came three mellow
klaxon hoots from the lough and the
throb of powerful engines tuning up in
it was urgency and warning and the
drumming of a launch that followed a
minute later showed that it had been
understood

  and now the curtains of the room
thick as they were glowed calcium white
under the direct rays of a searchlight jan
never forgot the sight as craig allenby
drew back one of the curtains the blind-
ing white eyes of half a dozen destroyers
six miles down the hill-girt water the
ghostly conning-tower and whaleback of
the u-boat the launch that slicked
frenziedly toward it

  it sank a minute later leaving the
launch afloat and empty on the surface
one moment it was there and then there
was nothing save an uneasy swirl of wa-
ter instantly the destroyer searchlights
went away and the only thing left in the
window-glass was the reflection of the
lamps of the room on the dark shield of
the night but there came the deep soft
boom of a depth-charge that set the pic-
tures on the wall shaking and then an-
other and another glinting a faint rose-
red in the depths of the lough and the
light thrum of speeding engines that
came inshore planting their deadly
bombs as they sped and circled

  allenby dropped the window-curtain

  thanks its like a public execution
it shouldnt be watched jan said with
a deep shudder she stood by his side
and his arm passed round her for an in-
stant to hold her

all was quiet now the thrum of
k the destroyers died away and a stag
roared distantly on the lough shore as
though an enervating wind had passed
through the room everybody felt ex-
hausted with the fierce excitement in-
voluntarily jan kept away from jethro
cobb though she knew there was no
logic in it that he had saved perhaps
hundred of other lives among them chil-
dren and women the lean implacable
face of karl schumann whose boyhood
had been iron discipline that was strong-
er than blood and whose youth had
trysted with and found death was hard
to banish

  jethro cobb came out of a reverie he
said

  mr wackett mr catchpole youre
both shaken and no wonder this is all
beyond your capacities perhaps you
yearn for london again if so i can
manage a conveyance to donegal where
you will get a train to belfast

  wackett grinned with an effort his
glance slid to camilla

  nope h said we stay we like
it everything ain- happened yet
very good camilla-

  she looked at him with a smile that
hid mingled hatred and fear not once
did she glance again at craig allenby

vv e come back to the old business
ar dont we mr cobb she said
its like passing through it thunderstorm
and then seeing the same old landscape
again poor conrad he muffed every-
thing i wish hed been more like that
terrible son of his her voice thickened
ever so slightly i shall go up after that
finn maccools crock oi gold without
your precious map that was conrads
voodoo not mine

  with messrs catchpole and wack-
ett poor partners dont camilla or
ought i to give the same advice to mr
catchpole and mr wackett

  she bent forward tigerishly for the
moment her control was gone

  have you taken it and hidden it
somewhere

  the subject tires me said jethro
cobb were all tired  think
camilla raised heavy lids

  your experiments about finished
she jeered jan and craig have come
down on the side of the angels-except
that theyre in love with each other you
knew me all the time catchpole and
wackett-well i leave you to judge

  i do youve set them on fire about
hidden treasure

  shucks said mr wackett glancing
at his fingers which shook a little we
dont believe in it but its a bit of
fun- he broke off to ask gawd-will
there be bodies floating about do you
think funny if the dutcher came back
that way that is if they got him on
board their launch before the hooter
blew maybe they didnt and hell be
back any misute

  im very much afraid that unhappy
man is still alive said jethro cobb
after what seemed a long pause they
all waited because there was a note of
quiet certainty in his voice


the submarines treasure

  a flaw of rain pattered on the win-
dow-glass as he spoke and they heard
molloy the but ler answer the door he
must have had a stout heart to do it
when conrad schumann entered the
room a minute later he looked round
with an unnatural calm though he was
the hue of clay in deep silence he sat
down and then spoke

  karl was correct about me i was
not to be trusted he said but it was
only when the warning went that i
slipped diem till then i was ready to
take my physic you understand but i
knew they were trapped and i dared
not go aboard i dared not they did
not even fire at me when i broke away
they were too intent on getting back to
their posts though they too knew it was
all finished

  he sat there like a lost man then sud-
denly broke into a loud laugh

  you thought karl was a fine boy
herr cobb i am sure he would not
get drunk and make a fool of himself
as i did   am an ill-mannered guest
and had better hand myself over as a
prisoner of war

raig allenby touched his shoul-
der youve had enough of every-
thing for one night conrad he said
get to bed

  presently he swayed to his feet
but i would like to explain it was not
fear of karl and the court of inquiry
that would have been strictly just i
can see that hellish white tunnel we
should all have crouched in a shud-
der passed through him and i can
hear karl passing sentence he would
of course not have executed it himself
we should have come to the surface and
half a dozen of his men would have shot
me blindfold on deck i was prepared
for all that it was a relief it is just
possible that karl would have kissed me
farewell for father and son do that in
germany you understand all that i
was prepared for till the alarm went
then i dared not go aboard

  go to bed conrad craig reiterated
obediently schumann went though
he seemed to remember camilla and
paused to give her a long look that some-
how held no meaning but only ex-
pressed his  umbed brain whatever
conrad schumann might be next day
and as long as he should live he was a
man haunted by phantoms that night
presently camilla who had recovered
her poise said those men would die

very quickly i suppose im going to
forget them with the aid of a sleeping-
draft after all its war and ive no rea-
son to like germans    its marvelous
to all know each other as well as we do
now isnt it good night craig pleas-
ant dreams if possible jan

  tough said mr wackett following
her with his eyes he seemed alarmed
at the idea of being left unsupported in
the vicinity of jethro cobb save by his
partner bit of snooker before beddy-
byes catch and a sleeping-draft or
two likewise for me i dont like war
when it knocks at the front door and
makes a man nuts like that

they left and when they had gone
it was craig allenby who firstspoke
cobb seemed to wait for him to do so
and jan listened in silence

  im your paid man cobb he said
and i need the pay too at least until
i can touch my uncles money if ever
i owe you a pile of thanks but im not
going to let miss feversham stay here
man cant you see that all those four
people are riper for mischief than they
ever were theyre in one bunch now
and theyve degenerated

  theres one thing about you up to
now allenby jethro said youve
minded your own business and youve
never asked many questions

 ill ask one now craig said if
conrad hid some bullion among the
mountains as he seems to have done
why dont you give him that map he
asked for and let them find it theyd
never get it out of the country it be-
longs to the nation i suppose it would
be a criminal offence to handle it un-
less-he paused-you want it for your-
self

  they think i do murmured jethro
cobb i dont i told you that jan
its true -i hope you dont mind my
calling her by her christian name al-
lenby

  it was faintly ironical he seemed
deadly tired and frail-looking some
gray ash fell from his cigar to his coat
lapel as he sat between them and he
brushed it away carefully

  theyll want to get it away from sin-
ners castle if they find the stuff he
said thats the difficulty we should
be in the way

jan stirred she did not look at craig
allenby but her eyes met jethro
cobbs in perplexity


the blue book magazine

  i dont understand you she said
nobody ever did he answered
but some day when youre my wife-
if you decide to marry me-youll know
more than anybody else im a puritan
but not a simple one i believe one
makes ones own hell listen to me
ill do what you want me to im pre-
pared to leave here if youll come with
me jan you and allenby

  craig

  craig lies still in my employ we
all go away for a few days dont you
see his blue eyes began to glisten
he was like some boy with a new idea
and it was impossible to tell whether
it was an inspiration or part of his plans
we leave those four people at sinners
castle to do as they wish camilla and
conrad-catchpole and wackett ca-
milla has no use for anybody but camil-
la conrad has made his own hell
wackett is a beast of limited intellect
catchpole-hes a dark horse mr
catchpole is always in the background
consider mr catchpole allenby what
do you think of him

  im not the psychologist you are re-
plied allenby dryly and he always
manages to avoid me perhaps im too
big and rough for him

  well leave em here said jethro
cobb molloy will look after their
creature comforts they can either pull
the place down to find conrads metal
map or they can go up to saddleback
pat without it well come back in a
few days and see what theyve done
tomorrow morning then

  he had decided jan thought i won-
der if he really is quite normal but
everything hes done so far has had a
reason she would have liked to go out
of the room with him when he went
but touching her hand very lightly he
limped away craig allenby hardly
waited until the door closed

  jan

  its no use she said i know what
youre going to say were made for
each other and you knew it from the
beginning and you thought id under-
stand about camilla but im going to
stick to him if he wants me i couldnt
let him down

  i know craig said bitterly you
adore him its a lightning love-affair
just the same flash of lightning all
round she half-smiled though her
heart felt small lets forget it
looking at him she knew that he
never intended to forget it she knew
not the slightest bit about his character
he might really have killed somebody
in the heat of the moment but what he
wanted he clung to his mouth was
hard and obstinate the manner in
which he had cwteived camilla proved
that he knew something about women
in the way some absolutely clean men
did they were born with it

  old mans darling he sneered
thats cheap craig im not a
schoolgirl myself and hes not an old
man isnt this disloyal on the part of
two people who owe him a lot

  i owe him nothing very much   
itll be like being married to a senior
wrangler with the heart of a child jan
it sounds not too bad    you dont
see why you shouldnt take anything you
want do you craig

  not particularly i seldom thought
about it for one thing i never met a
woman like you before

  im just middlingly straight thats
all and a lot of women can stick dan-
ger as well as men theyll have to now
war has come you mustnt mention
this again craig

  i wont ill take you some day
without mentioning it jan he said
ill stay by cobb and ill stay by you
but once away from here ill try to make
sure he wont bring you back

chapter five

the plane one of three belonging to
a black young irishman who had
flown in the spanish war and now ran
irish skyways dublin limited arrived
promptly at noon next day camilla
conrad wackett and catchpole all
gathered to watch them climb into the
fuselage-catchpole as usual slightly be-
hind jan from her seat glanced curi-
ously at his low brow and bushy eye-
brows remembering the recent emphasis
jethro cobb had laid on mr catchpole
thus seeming to bring the man into the
foreground for the first time he was
fat and piglike yet since they had land-
ed at sinners castle in his clergymans
guise and out of it he had never left his
shifty alertness for a moment
the submarines treasure

  wackett cried auf wiedersehn and
clapped conrad schumann on the back
to call attention to his german it was
understood that jethro cobb his fiancee
and his secretary were going to london
for a few days before returning to cashel
murtag it seemed to jan that there
was something mocking in the slim
tautness of camilla as she waved fare-
well when the plane took off and a ten-
sion about all four of them which they
tried to hide

  back to a world at war jethro
cobb said youll find though that
life goes on lifes a bigger thing than
the biggest war that ever happened so
is death he added in an undertone
and jan knew he was thinking of young
karl schumann

dublin and the slinking cross-chan-
nel boat london-mantled in dark-
ness they drove to a house in kensing-
ton with a big portico and soft lights
behind the drawn blinds and london
muted and dark outside but cheerful
with the pulse of its eternal life mov-
ing under the blackout a plump bus-
tling housekeeper came forward to
greet them half-shyly he introduced
jan and craig allenby for as he entered
the house cobb seemed to change into
a harmless and lovable bachelor who
had been away for some time and was
now glad to be by his own fireside again

  not that i shall ask you to stay in
london always jan when weve finished
with sinners castle he said next morn-
ing theres a fairly big house in hert-
fordshire full of youngsters at the mo-
ment of course i had it fitted up about
a month ago to take one of the east
end childrens hospitals-though chil-
dren dont interest me except as human
beings they bore me till they grow up
and yet in his study there were signs
of all sorts of activities radio clinics and
a derelict town in durham which he
seemed to run completely subscriptions
to hospitals arid charities that staggered
jan with their size when she saw them

  its a secret he said i use another
name have you ever heard of john
goodfellow

  she had because during the last year
all the newspapers had been hunting aft-
er the real identity of a man who used
the obviously assumed name of john
goodfellow for his generous gifts

  its really a company i formed he
said i lefi everything to them i
couldnt be bothered you wont mind

ive plenty of money left  i wonder
what those four are doing at sinners
castle there are going to be exciting
happenings there yet

  jan was beginning to feel the strain a
little she could almost think that he
purposely threw craig allenby and her-
self together and wondered if it was a
streak of subtle cruelty that ran in him
craig was quiet almost sullen his dark
eyes smoldered at both of them once he
went out for a few hours and came back
tight-mouthed and silent jethro cobb
smiled at him faintly

  old friends not so genial he asked
too soon for them to forget you know

you were better at sinners castle allen-
by unless youve got the courage to take
the bull by the horns and face things
through jan might help you you used
to dine at the san sisto in your wild days
didnt you take her there this eve-
ning

  so it was that-though it was folly on
the part of the three of them-craig al-
lenby and jan in a dark red frock that
suited her dark hair and the sunburned
olive of her skin passed through the
blacked-out doorway of the san sisto
club to the pearl-and-ebony brightness
within

  this was my hang-out once craig
said with her deep in his arms among the
dancers a lot of the old gang are still
here theyre broad-minded but they
draw the line at murderers watch em
do the ishmael act and do i care when
i can hold you like this mrs jethro
cobb-to-be

it was dangerous when he held her
still closer laughing with his cheek
against hers as men and women began to
turn in startled recognition she felt part
of him and as reckless and amused as he
was a young man in captains uniform
drawled something in his ear and she all
but swung round like a spitfire at the
puppy an almost perceptible lane was
left for them as they quitted the dance-
floor and walked to their table in an al-
cove somebody laughed cynically and
a slim fox-faced young man gave allen-
by a stiff reticent bow before turning
away

  thats mackness junior counsel to
the eminent kc who got me off craig
said as they sat down like to hear the
story

  it would put in a background said
jan her heart in her eyes as she looked
at him though she didnt know it so

the blue book magazine

far its only been sinners castle and
neither of us thought it strange

i i kept it between my teeth though
i told the gentle camilla a lot of damn
lies    my uncle old john middleton
was a retired steel man middletons
metals he allowed me a couple of
thousand a year but i wasnt a lily of the
field altogether jan i took my degree
in metallurgy and part of the time i
worked pretty hard at the steelworks in
coventry but uncle john liked me in
london hed begun life himself mak-
ing tin-tacks in a cellar in birmingham
and for the last of the middleton clan
-me-there was to be nothing like that
he spoiled me pretty well the dear old
chap you see the result

  yes go on

  he wanted me to marry a girl-an
incredible creature from the counties
who looked and talked like a horse she
did jan uncle thought her smoke-
room stories were typical of the english
aristocracy i didnt and we quarreled
he cut off my allowance but  carried
on with the spending of it all the same
i went to see him several times and we
had a slanging match i went up once
too often and found him dead-mur-
dered the police arrested me there
was some highly circumstantial evidence
im not going to tell you about it now
its all over allenby ended what
does it matter cobb salvaged me for
his own reasons and took me to sinners
castle where i met you thats good
enough

  he swung her to the dance-floor again
he was about the biggest man there and
the hysteria of a new war was popping
the corks at the san sisto if she hadnt
been with him he would very likely have
made a rough-house out of sheer devilry
and the pain and rage which was in his
soul somebody started an ironical clap-
ping when toward midnight they made
their exit across the floor

  you see he laughed bitterly

  the empty-headed beasts i didnt
know people could be so childish but
you stuck it well some day theyll be
sorry craig

the embankment was all moonlight
that touched jans lips making them
look as dewy as she felt in all her being
as they walked along the spell of sin-
ners castle out in the atlantic darkness
seemed to have drifted over to london
a thing that followed them and could
not be shaken off they watched the

black velvet of the river flow past and
the searchlights playing down the estu-
ary and jan feversham knew she was
lost she lifted her face and suddenly
felt craig allenbys mouth on hers and
his arms holding her

  you cant go on wi h it you wont
  she stayed close to him

  i dont think i can you oughtnt
to have come back with us craig i owe
him a lot even if you dont and to
break faith with him like this-it makes
us no more honest than camilla con-
rad all of them i cant face him
well not face him hes a gnome
and hed do something youd be back
at sinners castle before you knew jan
i cant take the middleton estate or
show myself in london till i find out
who killed the old man but i can get
a job in the laboratory up there theyll
need me now lets go 

 no she shook her head no
more running away well tell him to-
gether

  she knew he wincecl but he never
meant to let her go ami to him jethro
cobb was less than nothing now al-
lenby hailed a taxi and in silence they
sat in it while jan was telling herself
thinking of jethro cobb he said he
wouldnt hold me against my will its
probably all part of his experiments he
knew craig and i were in love and he
threw us together

  a small parcel addressed to her lay on
the table in the big hall when they
reached the house at kensington open-
ing it with foreboding she stood staring
at the sapphire-and-diamond ring which
fell from the little case it contained a
note was folded with it

     will you wear it if its the right size
  as i think it is if you dont like it we
  can change it tomorrow when i come
  back ive gone into the country for the
  night

  a sharp breath came from craig al-
lenby

  hes a cunning devil with his sin-
ners castle tricks what made him dp
that leave it jan

  then he bit his lip for the maid who
had admitted them still stood there ad-
mirably trained and demure though she
must have heard him

  a gentleman has been here about an
hour waiting to see you sir mr jessup
the name was he specklly asked for
both you and miss feversham sir

  mr jessup was already si anding when


the submarines treasure

they entered the room he was a thick-
set man with a houndlike furrow in
each cheek and dose-cropped hair that
carried an unexpected quiff over the
forehead though he looked like a
prosperous bookmaker he was dressed
in perfect taste and his hat gloves and
walking-stick lay neatly deposited on the
couch he handed allenby a card which
read simply

  ex-inspector tom jessup late cid

he made no preamble but took some
notes from his pocket then he put
them aside to address jan

  about your sister miss kate miss
feversham youll maybe be interested
to hear that she was married to mr hu-
bert twistleton yesterday morning at
st georges hanover square too
though it was quiet on account of the
war they had no honeymoon mr
twistleton going into the army and
miss kate getting their country-house
ready for convalescent officers

  mr allenby- mr jessup permit-
ted himself a glance of dry curiosity at
craig in re the middleton case this
is the situation so far as we establish it
about two months ago a young woman
who was an artists model took refuge in
mr john middletons house in chelsea
her story was that an artist shed become
infatuated with was beating her up and
making her life a misery and shed run
away well mr middletor was kind to
her kind i said nothing else he
was a simple old man and a-well a
knight chivalrous so to speak

  but she was the wife of a wrong un
and there was  cruel artist it was the
old blackmail story connery-that was
his name and we have him on our books
-went up one night after his wife to
gather the dibs that was the night of
the th of july an unlucky day youll
remember the old man put up a fight
went to the phone and got as far as a
police call when ccnnery killed him-
not actually meaning to i dont suppose
mrs connery hadnt bargained for mur-
der and showed a clean pair of heels
so did connery no doubt because when
you got there there was only your un-
cle and three or four minutes later
the police correct mr allenby

  mechanically craig nodded

  bad luck said mr jessup but
go through the old bailey records and
youll be surprised how many hangings
and a few gettings-off depend on a
chance like that

  jan caught at her breath telling her-
self that for the moment it mattered
nothing who this mysterious individual
was

  have you come to tell us youve got
this connery

  mr jessup looked at her no miss
feversham but weve got his young
and beautiful wife for she is that
though connerys middle-aged she fin-
ished with him when he left her and beat
it somewhere we had a score of men
and women on the job but it was
young mrs connery who walked into
the office and gave us the whole low-
down for the sake of the thousand
pounds reward we had on offer ended
mr jessup significantly

  he opened a neat wallet and took out
a photograph wrapped in tissue-paper

  never saw him that night i dont
suppose he said maybe he was dis-
guised a bit mrs connery says he fan-
cied himself at that in a modest way
clergymen and such this is him

a



pulse at jans throat started to
beat and she was afraid mr jes-
sup would see it craigs own hand was
quite steady as he took the picture and
she looked at it over his shoulder even
before her glance focused she knew that
the clean-shaven rather oily man in the
photograph and the retiring mr catch-
pole of the yacht brantane and of sin-
ners castle were the same

  no answered craig i didnt see
him

  carefully ex-inspector jessup put the
photograph away in its wrappings
watching him jans thoughts danced
within her brain yes its catchpole
craig gave that answer because he means
to go back to sinners castle to get the
man himself he would and jethro
cobb is behind every bit of this of
course aloud she said

  its all terribly thrilling wont you
have a drink mr jessup

  no thanks mr jessup glanced
solemnly at the clock i never drink
before five in the morning war-time
vow well once we get connery and let
him know its up youre all clear mr
allenby youll hold your head up in
society again as they say the young
woman wont get a smell of mr cobbs
thousand pounds till hes convicted so
shell be glad to do her bit i was glad
to come along and report to you when
mr cobb asked me to tonight if i
may say so sir youre lucky to have a
the blue book magazine

man like him kindly disposed toward
you

 thanks-i know that answered
craig his laugh was a little brittle
hes quite a good fairy like rumpel-
stiltskin

  old german fairy-tale eh not the
new kind mr jessup picked up hat
gloves and stick with an answering
laugh well have connery soon never
fear

  jan went back with slow steps into the
room after she had let him out craig
stood back against the table and watched
her enter

  he must have had an idea who catch-
pole was when he brought him on that
trip that was part of his bag of tricks
too hed put jessup on the job as
soon as my trial was over and while
jessup was playing mrs connery hed
see her himself and get a bead from her
on wackett wackett was catchpoles
pal and might have been hiding him
cobb landed them both together for the
trip through his newspaper advertise-
ment for guests

  perhaps we shall never know till
he tells us you owe him something
now craig

  yes better put on that ring jan
  id better

  they both smiled with some white-
ness at each other and after a few sec-
onds craig looked at the clock which
showed nearly an hour after midnight
his intention was to change and get the
first irish train that left euston catch-
pole was his own personal meat and if
he had to swim home with the man he
would get him into that dock where he
had stood himself he felt a bleak kind
of eagerness possess him

  good-by jan perhaps youll thank
cobb for me

  there was no need to explain she
knew his purpose another woman
would have wanted him to take jessup
and one or two scotland yard men but

the sorcery of sinners castle still lay on
them both and jessup and scotland
yard would have obtruded too much
from the outside world

  so she merely said

  good-by youll have to thank him
yourself ive an idea you may see us at
cashel murtag

chapter six

in the wan dawn five hours later craig
allenby caught the irish mail at eu-
ston he slept that night before the
turf fire of a whitewashed cabin within
distant sight of saddleback pat and the
little family of donegal peasants watchcd
the mad stranger out of sight as he made
for the sea through a soft atlantic rain
early next morning it was a long tramp
across a rough and rugged wilderness
allenby didnt find it hard to believe in
a cache of mildewed gold hidden in the
gullies of saddleback pat with pixies
among the peat pools of blackadders
bog guarding it when after hours
cashel murtag and the lough and the
misty atlantic with no sign of war on it
came into view he had decided to try
to take sinners castle in the flank and
arrive there unseen-a reconnaissance
before the raid on mr catchpole

  in the thin drizzle there was a chance
of success his plan was to come un-
aware upon catchpole arid trust to luck
and the sailing curragh to get his quarry
away conscious or unconscious trussed
or free molloy the butler might help
him

  steady he told himself

  he was relishing the idea of violence
too much and had almost forgotten in a
way he had the other people at sinners
castle it seemed long now since he
had danced with jan at the san sisto
under the war-time blackness of london
and the war itself seemed to have re-
ceded again until-as he crept over the


the submarines treasure

rocks-a gray armed merchant cruiser ap-
peared and vanished out at sea and a
seaplane droned invisibly

  the wolfhound puppy came lolloping
out to him and he sent it away outraged
and grieved by the casting of a stone
what instinct held him from walking
boldly up to the castle-door or even pre-
senting himself to molloy in the kitchen
he didnt know but it was there

he saw conrad schumann as he slid
half-bent over the broken sea-
wall the man stood on the grass look-
ing out to sea quite motionless as
though on some vigil which had lasted
long and would never end allenby
spoke quietly behind him

  see anything conrad

  the german turned slowly if he felt
any surprise he gave no sign but some-
thing in his eyes gave craig a disagree-
able jar

  so it is you allenby no i see
nothing now there are still patches of
oil in the backwaters but a submarine
leaves little wreckage yesterday i bur-
ied bohm-karnfeld he came to the sur-
face you understand the only one
he was a very strong nazi  so was
karl karl stood on the conning-tower
with his arms folded you of course
think that inhuman

  schumann asked the question with a
touch of anxiety he seemed to think it
important to get allenbys reactions
craig answered with involuntary irony
it wasnt chivalrous to say the least
chivalry yes they consider them-
selves knights but they cannot help but
jeer at a fallen enemy it is something
that was born in them out of the humili-
ation of the last war i think something
that their leaders have bred in them  
karl never came up i look for him all
the time they grow wild at me ca-
milla and those two men they say i
am a fool but until karl comes up i
shall not go to saddleback pat with or
without the metal m

  with an effort craig asked why
not

  conrad lit a cigarette the grass at
his feet was littered with stubs

  that is easily answered this ver-
fluchte lough is but a valley belonging to
saddleback pat and the other hills
which the sea has flowed over and cov-
ered centuries ago till i am sure that
karl is not up there waiting for me when
i go till i have given him decent burial
i do not move 

  conrad schumann was quietly mad
only his eyes and the way he spoke gave
him away he presented quite a normal
picture except lor that and in his fixed
idea alone his sanity had gone the
brute and the child still remained there
unreliable and dangerous he looked
almost gay though he was dead sober
he seemed glad of allenbys appearance
as a bored sentry might be his bearded
mouth smiled as he said

  herr cobb and his charming fiancee
are with you no doubt

  i came ahead craig answered and
schumann laughed lightly

  that camilla you are brave to
scorn her as you did and then come
back to face her hell has no fury like
it as our shakespeare says do you see
anything floating out yonder

  his hand turned craigs shoulder to
direct his gaze and he pointed uncom-
fortably allenby pretended to search the
gray water and uncomfortably he felt
schumanns hold tighten he narrowed
his glance and was shaking his head
when he became aware of something that
pressed into his back and a suave and
precise voice behind him spoke

  turn about and walk straight into
the vestry mr allenby if it isnt incon-
venient sir    thank you very much
conrad -dont make any violent move-
ment mr allenby i beg you it will be
so much nicer for all of us if you do as
you are told please start going my dear
friend the speaker ended with a hol-
low cough unaccustomed as i am to
public shooting i have reason for doing
my best mr allenby

the wintry humor in the voice of mr
catchpole would have sent a chill
through anybody who had observed his
hitherto retiring manner conrad schu-
manns slanting eyebrows went up and
he shrugged humorously before turning
to survey the water again obviously
he had seen catchpole approaching and
taken his part to keep allenbys atten-
tion that done he lost interest

  craig began to move there was noth-
ing else for it

  the distance to the big front door of
sinners castle was short but it seemed
to last a long time when a pistol held by
a man one intended to bring to the hang-
man was pressed against the backbone

  your old room mr allenby it was
very comfortable i believe

  he stumbled up the wide stairs in a
helpless rage that he knew to be unwise

the blue book magazine

because he needed all his wits if he
could have turned and borne catchpole
down with a wholesale breaking of limbs
of both of them he would have been
glad to do so there was a humorous
side to the picture and it had the effect
of cooling him when he saw who sat
on the bed in his room chewing an un-
lighted cigar he was able to smile a
greeting

  hullo wackett tell me is this
man behind me our reverend mr
catchpole

  its im said mr wackett running
a finger round a particularly violent
checked soft collar as though it was too
tight better do as he tells you mr
allenby dont think the butler can
help you he and his missus are in the
cellar-and catchpole did it -what do
you want catch

  tie him up wackett hes as strong
as the bull of bashan

  bible again muttered wackett dis-
tastefully all right catch ill do it

when mr wackett had finished the
job by the use of a strong rope it
was well enough done if catchpole had
any suspicion that craig knew his real
identity he showed no sign of it but
surveyed the result with wicked lazy
eyes that seemed to have grown rounder
in their pupils like a cats at night on
the other hand wackett sweated slight-
ly with discomfort he was obviously
glad to leave the scene of violence when
catchpole led the way left alone al-
lenby tried to think it seemed clear
there was discord and some demorali-
zation at sinners castle that helped
him not at all at the moment far from
being forcibly brought to justice catch-
pole was more likely to kill him on
slight provocation if not actually in
cold blood already he had committed
one murder nor if jan and jethro
cobb came would he hesitate about
them if the gold-bug had also got into
his brain

  it gave craig a cold feeling that last-
ed a long time the opening of the
door and the entry of mr wackett with
a well-spread tray roused him a lot of
mr wacketts jauntiness had gone his
cheeks were mottled and his sharp nose
sharper the picture of his gentle part-
ner with a pistol in his hand seemed to
have unstrung him but when craig
spoke he shook his head

  shut your trap mr allenby an
when catchs by keep it shut thats

all here ill loosen up your hands
but no lammin out it aint no use
the tray was set for two people and
he guessed instinctively who his lunch
partner was to be before camilla ap-
peared he crushed his violent hatred
of her as she came in a faint flush on
her cheeks and her teeth biting on her
lip as she saw him

  how perfectly absurd she mur-
mured

  with a movement that had something
animal about ft she tin fastened mr
wacketts rope and threw it away to
his surprise her voice trembled

  ill not lunch with a bound man
she said even if he happens to detest
me all right craig i wont mention
that again everythings gone to bits
here i suppose were none of us clever
enough  wanted that gold like hell
but im beginning to believe there isnt
any and that ive lost the bit of stuff i
called my soul for nothing not that i
ever had much of it touching isnt
it

  she laughed though she might be a
good actress she was genuinely pale and
her green eyes were dark and tired
there was a touch of despair at herself
in them as she looked at allenby he
didnt sec it though it concerned him
but he noticed that she was almost
plain and her allure had gone

  the wages of sin camilla as cobb
might say he returned lightly though
were none of us flawless as he might
say again whats the next move in the
melodrama

again she laughed though the laugh
l died away

  youve seen how conrad is theres
something at sinners castle and you
know it yourself craig all the things
that seem mad anywhere else become
natural here he wont move till hes
sure that karl isnt sitting in the cave up
on saddleback pat not that we havent
searched everywhere for his metal map
but without finding it catchpole and
wackett made a journey on their own
they only got as far as the bog and
stuck there-nearly for good why did
you come alone like this

  something made him answer

  i came for catchpole hes the man
who murdered my uncle cobb brought
him along as part of the experiment i
think he guesses that i know too
camilla started and a pulse stirred at
her throat


the submarines treasure

  i could help you listen craig he
has coffee with me in the evenings he
-well he rather fancies his chances
you wouldnt think it but hes a ladies
man ive got some sleeping-tablets with
me it wouldnt be hard to send him to
sleep

  she stopped with a wry smile

  oh i dont mean aconitine though
ive got some of that left over from the
erich affair just in case for myself i
mean its clean and painless heres
the tablets if you dont believe me

craig looked at the small container
which she rolled off her palm beside
his plate he let it lie

  youre a dangerous person camilla

 almost imperceptibly her breath
caught i was im not-now im
beat i dont believe conrads crock of
gold is there and if it was wed never
be able to get it away it all seemed so
real-till we got here then it became
fairy gold at the rainbows end which
is as it should be in ireland but not so
good for a woman like me let me help
you craig i can-and id do anything
for you

  she poured out coffee with a hand that
hung unsteadily over the two cups it
was not the ash-blonde and vital camilla
who had landed from the brantane
but a woman left stranded by her own
emotions for perhaps the only time in
her life

  craig sat utterly silent

  camilla spoke again

  sorry craig sorry if i tried to make
you think anything id help you just
the same

  thanks he said with an effort

  she pushed his coffee across knowing
her offer refused it was a moment of
queer tension in which craig allenby
tried to understand a woman and com-
pletely failed to break it he walked
to the window stretched his cramped
muscles and looked out the rain had
stopped and the sky was breaking into
ragged patches of blue above the lough
at first the picture of a yellow funnel
and white hull approaching in the dis-
tance seemed no more than a hallucina-
tion but it was clear enough and grow-
ing clearer each second war and mines
and submarines and all the brantane
was coming once more to sinners castle
he watched her again for a few mo-
ments and then became aware that he
could also watch something else from
there in a small circidar mirror that

hung on the wall the table the coffee-
cups and camillas hands were reflected
if camillas hands hadnt moved his at-
tention would never have been caught
one of them dropped something lightly
into his cup it hovered above her own
uncertainly then was withdrawn it
was all like some small close-up on a tele-
vision screen

  dope craig thought turning with-
out any hurry im to be put to sleep
instead of catchpole for some reason
his glance sought the tube of tablets by
his plate they were still there camil-
la had not touched them had forgotten
them it was some other and far more
potent stuff she had used she was a
little whiter than before but not much
if she had dared she would have put
something in her own cup but her reso-
lution had failed

  i never asked you how you left jan
she said jerkily

  if im not mistaken youll see for
yourself before long craig answered
go and look out of the window

  she rose precipitately all her self-pos-
session gone and obeyed craig hesi-
tated oddly a few days before he
could have grinned at the situation but
there was nothing humorous about this
other camilla-who in the mood she
was in would have liked to bring about
a double tragedy but was as afraid to
die as she was afraid to live unlike her
husband

  theyve come back so youre safe
drink your coffee and well get down to
them craig catchpole darent do any-
thing now

  she drank hers hastily and set down
her cup there were three five-gram
sleeping-tablets dissolved in it

  ill not drink mine i think craig
said evenly

she stared then with one hand hold-
ing the table brushed the back of
her other across her forehead on the
polished floor her chair grated back
she stood with her head hanging

  youre clever craig i dont believe
id have let you drink it i meant to go
myself too but i darent i was all
washed up i couldnt leave you behind
i thought and then i couldnt go myself
i must have caught it all from erich
she laughed chokily ask jethro cobb
for the explanation-

  all right no ill-feeling said craig
and caught her gently as she drooped in-
to the chair

chapter seven

on the old stone landing-quay of
cashel murtag jethro cobb and
jan feversham watched the motor-
launch which had disembarked them be-
ing hauled up into the davits of the
brantane while the yacht herself with
smooth engines turned her slim bows
and gathered way seaward it had taken
two hours from sligo bay where she lay
waiting for her gray paint and her guns
and her wind-bitten rnr crew now
she hurried back like a debutante eager
for her new uniform no sign of life
came from sinners castle

  theyre not very subtle said jethro
cobb they might have made some
pretence of a welcome or even sent
molloy out that is if hes at liberty
which i doubt

  they were waiting till they were sure
the yacht wasnt staying perhaps said
jan hadnt we better go in

  the big oak door swung open to
cobbs hand he looked bright and ac-
tive in spite of his limp and more like
a leprechaun than usual jan thought
she herself was prepared for anything
now though if anything had hap-
pened to craig she meant if she had to
spend all jethro cobbs money on it to
exact full payment all round   

  anybody here called cobb enter-
ing the library

  the door closed with a snap behind
them catchpole stood before the fire-
place with wackett by his side and his
pistol covering the two of them from
the door conrad schumann walked to
the hearthrug and joined them catch-
pole spoke in a voice from which all
the oil had seeped away

  were after that metal map mr
cobb and were going to have it
youre going to take us to the place
where youve hidden it without wasting
one minute if you dont want to be a
dead man is that clear

 ethro cobb gestured jan to a
 chair and sat down himself

  clear enough catchpole he said
things seemed to have happened here
mr catchpole in command eh thats
interesting have you looked in the
panel of the library mantelpiece
bashed the ole room to bits wack-
ett spoke his adams apple moving as
he swallowed for gawds sake no
monkey tricks mr cobbl it aint any
use catchs off the handle

  you wouldnt have found it there
said jethro cobb if only because ca-
milla went there first she watched me
place it there one evening when i was
with miss feversham where is camil-
la she ought to be here    here it is

i took it away and brought it back by
rights i believe its yours conrad

  conrads fingers all but snatched the
disk of dull metal for an instant catch-
poles weapon swung uncertainly to him
and then was lowered with his face
thin and exultant conrad began to un-
screw the back of the disk and took out
a flat sheet of notepaper stained and
crinkled but still holding the figures and
rough compass-sketch which his foun-
tain-pen had drawn twenty-one years be-
fore the three faces made a strange
picture of avarice and excitement and
jan thought she heard jethro cobb give
a little sigh

  correct conrad he asked

  to think that sometimes i thought it
all a dream murmured conrad it
was so mixed up with death and damna-
tion at the bottom of the sea it was
very difficult to empty the explosive from
the torpedo i cut it from i remember
we laughed we were so drunk with
brandy and defeat somebody said
dont worry about the tri-nitro-toluol
conrad it will solve all our problems
karl would have never gone to pieces
like that

  if he remembered his vigil for the
body of his son he had forgotten it now
the sight of the map had driven another
kind of madness into him which was
shared by his companions overhead 
the clock of sinners castle chimed and
there might have been a sardonic note
in it

  conrad placed the metal map in his
pocket and though the other two
watched his movements they said noth-
ing but presently wacketts light eyes
rested on jethro cobb with a dawning
flicker of uncertainty and suspicion mr
wackett between a low cunning and a
natural shrewdness was on the horns of
a dilemma

  wait a minute he said this aint
natural not even for a queer guy like
you why didnt you go after the stuff
yourself cobb

  the question has been asked before
mr wackett cobb said the answer
is always the same i am already a rich
man i might get into trouble with the
authorities who besides confiscating it
and using it to pay for an hour or two of


the submarines treasure

 the war may imprison me ive been in
 prison once mr wackett lastly i
 dont believe the gold is there i think
 it is a figment of lieutenant schumanns
 imagination

 conrad gave his deadly smile and
 glanced questioningly at catchpoles
 pistol then shrugged as wackett said
 sharply hell none of that the ger-
 man looked out of the window at the
 daylight of which some nine hours were
 still left the fever that lay all over him
 communicated itself to the other two
 they had forgotten camilla forgotten
 everything in their sudden dream of
 riches jan thought theyve been too
  long at sinners castle its got into
 their blood perhaps it was always in
 conrads    i wonder where craig is
 wackett said licking his lips howll
 we get the stuff down here it must be
 darned heavy

   conrad lifted opaque eyes from the
 paper in his hand

   five of the men carried it like pack-
 mules we shall do likewise but first
 we will locate it i shall find the place
 now the three of us will go his
 bearded mouth slipped into a grin it
 is not business for a woman after all

  these two-

theres the cellar said catchpole
there is also the lough said con-
rad grinning at jan it held the same
adolescent cruelty she tiad seen more
than once on erich schumann

   where your son karl is conrad
 jethro cobb reminded him quietly

   the man came savagely across to him
 but dropped his hand before the little
 tranquil face jan hardly noticed the
 incident because she had noticed some-
 thing more important it was a move-
 ment among the myrtles outside the big
 window which gatchpoles fattish figure
 half obscured it was in fact craig al-
 lenby with a deer-stalking rifle from the
 gun-room under hi arm she only saw

him for one instant and then almost
the next it seemed he was standing in
the doorway of the room with the glint-
ing double-barrel lifted to his shoulder
hand that pistol to mr cobb con-
nery dont hesitate a second about it
he ordered quietly

   the only sound came from mr wack-
ett he wore dentures and they snapped
together audibly in the shock of the mo-
ment but slowly the erstwhile catch-
pole after one long look at craigs trig-
ger-finger carried out the instruction in
some way he seemed to sink back into
his clergymans guise much as a hedge-
hog rolls into a ball though he must
have heard the name connery

   i want this man cobb said craig
i came here for him

   you seem to have got him jethro
cobb gingerly handled the pistol that
lay in his palm where is camilla al-
lenby id like her here to complete the

   you cant have her im afraid ca-
millas fast asleep drugged

teally cobbs surprise was
f scarcely noticeable rather an
anticlimax for her youll have to tell us
about it later mr wackett will you do
what is called frisk lieutenant conrad
just in case this cumbersome weapon
of allenbys will cover you while youre
doing it and now-as wackett after
springing nervously to his task finished
and shook his head in negative-i want
to say that this incipient violence was all
unnecessary if conrads story is true
he cached the bullion took the bearings
made the map-everything he is at lib-
erty to search for it and take with him
whoever he thinks fit

   thank you herr cobb said con-
rad his eyes were mad and bright
again a dry cough came from connery
he looked like one who had been mis-
judged there was something incor-
rigible about the way the man slipped
 
the blue book magazine

back into his greasy dignity again its
jethro cobb he thinks is a bit crazy not
conrad at all though mr wackett isnt
so sure now jan told herself she no-
ticed that craigs glance fell to jethro
cobbs ring which she wore on her fin-
ger but he was keeping close to connery
until cobb said in a low voice

  will you please sit down allenby
and leave it all to me let him go now

the three men had gone leaving the
room and indeed all of sinners
castle very quiet save for the lap of the
water outside the wind had blown an
iridescent scum of oil along the surface
and it slimed against the low sea-wall
lifting and falling with the swell

  that bullion isnt there said craig
allenby you took it yourself long
ago

  nearly two years ago said jethro
cobb he leaned forward to hand over
the pistol which was conrads luger
to craig

  i got on the trail of it quite by acci-
dent i was fishing in donegal with
erich schumann whom i knew slightly
and we sheltered the night at cashel
murtag-it was empty then there was
something rotten about the man i
didnt like him he had that metal map
with him hed taken it from his cousin
conrad once he hadnt the remotest
notion what it was about but i had
because i happened to be a junior part-
ner in a firm of bullion merchants in
mincing lane at the end of the last war
i heard one or two stories of piracy by
submarine crews and hiding-places on
the irish coast tommyrot most of
them but erich boasted a lot about
the tjnterseekinder schumanns of kiel
i bought cashel murtag for an old song
because i liked it and i went exploring
saddleback pat for the fun of the thing
without any precious map taking a
whole month over the job    hadnt
you better go and release the molloys
allenby

  theyll wait go on

  the stuff was there in a place that
was marked on the old maps as finn
maccools chimney an unromantic
mass of mildewed bags and boxes but
bullion is unromantic you know i
didnt believe in it a bit till i came on it
queer that i didnt believe in it yet
found it those three believe in it and
wont find it thats a bit like life   
i hired a man to burgle schumanns
house and bring me the metal map after

that because hed begun to tumble to
the truth when it was tco late and hed
got mixed up with the gestapo foreign
branch which meant of course that
our own secret service had him taped
and was watching him so he couldnt
move it pleased me something imp-
ish about me i suppose

  he gave jan his wistful smile she
said

  thats hqw you got all your money i

suppose

  no he shook his head i really
am rich my dear i always was rich it
went-he gestured vaguely-well on a
lot of different charities and things
most of it famine funds starving peo-
ple in different parts of this unhappy
world i got it across to holland and
realized on it pretty well there i got
my own kick out of it on this last occa-
sion when i found that i could hood-
wink camilla who was neither guilty
nor innocent and help allenby who
was inclined to be a coward and deceive
wackett and catchpole-who as you
know is the connery who killed john
middleton that unhappy conrad of
course came back and walked into the
drama and you jan-well that was
chance too but not altogether per-
haps

  he passed his hand through his white
hair

  we left jessup in sligo and hes
bringing a few of the civil guard over
to make sure of connery this evening
theyll intern conrad schumann too i
suppose that is unless- cobb inter-
rupted himself and looked across you
two might like to follow those rainbow-
gold seekers on saddleback pat im
sure youll easily pick them up with
those glasses of yours jan keep to the
green part of the bog when you cross it
and beware of loose boulders im too
tired to come ill release poor molloy
and his wife and perhaps take a look at
camilla shell hate to be out of this
but its a suitable punishment

jan and craig allenby found them-
selves out in the salty air soon after
moving over the marsh which ran up
from sinners castle to the moorland
and the scarred hump of saddleback pat
and its brother hills that crowded the
sky

  do you notice we always do what he
tells us whatever it is asked jan in a
low voice

  craig nodded after a moment he said


the submarines treasure

    he thinks somethings going to hap-
  pen to them

   yes to conrad havent you got
 that feeling too

   the binoculars jan had snatched up
 showed conrad connery and wackett
 where they picked their way swiftly yet
 gingerly across blackadders bog craig
 left her behind with his long strides with
 conrads luger in his pocket for safety
 while she gazed

 half an hour and they themselves
 were on the bog with its black
 peaty pools a great loneliness seemed to
 wrap about them all at once a pale
 mist came creeping down from saddle-
 back pat drifted over them and passed
 out to sea where a convoy of tramps
 shepherded by lean destroyers and rest-
 less planes moved into the north chan-
 nel and a gun boomed the faint echo
 floated through the desolation   

    craig it looks as though we might be
  just wanting to laugh at them

   he made no answer nor did he tell
 her yet what had happened between
 camilla and himself they were now in
 a warlock country of dwarfed and twist-
 ed trees with saddleback pat brown and

	broken above them its sides a tumult of
  crevices and gullies the three ahead
  were scrambling quickly across the black
  buttresses of rock conrad in front
  seemed to have found his bearings he
  moved like a cat

   wet vapor curled about jan and al-
 lenbys panting breath they were half-
 way up saddleback pat not far away
 now but still unseen among the boul-
 ders and the wisps of mist the trio too
 absorbed to notice them the guns
 boomed out at sea again on their eter-
 nal hunting conrad turned unsteadily
 at the sound he made a gesture of de-
 fiance

    stop them craig theyll kill them-
  selves

    no theyre all rigfit theyve got
  a rope

    jan felt that saddleback pat looked
  down on it all with a touch of cold
  mirth the three men had stopped and
  craned over a deep tunnel-like cleft that
  fell all but sheer down the side of the
  mountain if it was finn maccools
  chimney it was well-named it went
  down thirty feet of almost circular shaft
  to a rocky ledge which jutted out into
  mist and empty spice six feet down as
  though cut by the hand of man was a
  square opening in the side allenby

crawling up to the three of them saw it
clearly-saw too the deadly peril of any
attempt to climb down to do it alone
as he certainly once had done jethro
cobb must have had nerves of steel so
too must conrad schumann but that
was twenty-one years before   

  i give you my word theres nothing
there craig spoke out appearing
abruptly cobb has taken it away

  wackett swiveled his head sharply
but connery barely noticed him nor did
schumann they were too passionately
absorbed the german was tying a
belay of the rope round a piece of rock
and testing it then knotting it about his
body connery watched him closely
there was a mere foothold in the chim-
ney that a practiced rock-climber and
few others might have used schumann
stepped over with the loop on his arm
and his face with its uplifted beard be-
gan to go down

  but as the dimness closed about him
he hesitated some claustrophobia from
his submarine days haunted him with
memories he looked round wildly at
the walls of rock and moss that shut him
in as the steel walls of a u-boat had shut
him in under the sea long before when
he etched a map to pass the time some
trick of the atmosphere brought the sul-
len explosions from the hunting destroy-
ers plainly to the heights of saddleback
pat

  and then all at once a large bird
kite or falcon flapped up past schu-
manns cringing face from the cranny
where it had been disturbed like a
ghost it slipped past him no cry left
him his nerveless hand let go the rope
and he went crashing down the rope
ran out tightened and snapped with the
sound of a broken cello-string they
saw his body hit the ledge below and
bounce out into the empty space beyond
where the bird he had disturbed hovered
high in air before shooting away

it was over in a matter of seconds
like something long foredoomed con-
nery still stared into the empty chimney
though wackett staggered back from the
edge a shaking hand pressed against his
mouth if there was ever a man who
had decided not to seek hidden treasure
again it was mr wackett

  keep back jan dear allenby bade
with a feeling of thankfulness he saw
she had not been close enough to see the
tragedy

  connery he called


the blue book magazine

  connery turned hastily he wiped
his mouth

  he must have thought that bird was
his boy he said i had nothing to do
with the rope breaking mr allenby a
terrible tragedy of course he was non
compos mentis but there is still enough
rope left for one of us to climb down
and make sure if the poor man died for
nothing

  he actually picked up the broken
length of rope then let it fall with a
sigh and a shake of the head even then
he clung to the guise of catchpole as
though loath to leave go of the character
only his eyes were small and fiery with
wickedness 

  step out here connery command-
ed craig

  thats is name said wackett husk-
ily and mines sucker always was
even when i looked after him after the
middleton murder wanted to double-
cross poor conrad he did the slimy
snail im and me traipsin through
the bogs with a load of gold apiece and
im shoving me in one of those pools as
soon as he could that was his idea
always the quiet ones that are the worst
it is look at im good job he hasnt
a gun

  i have im tired of them said
craig better lead the way with him
down to sinners castle wackett

mr wackett had gone next morn-
ing when dawn crept from behind
saddleback pat flowed over sinners
castle and the lough and spread out to
the little black ships that felt their way
into safety by the fading light of rathlin
obimes lighthouse mr wackett his
partner having been taken away the
night before by mr jessup and five
genial irish policemen had chanced the
wilderness and would no doubt be
heard of in london again but not in
the neighborhood of jethro cobb   

  and you camilla cobb asked it
was about midday though the old clock
of cashel murtag had not struck be-
cause it had run down cobb sat with
his hands clasped thoughtfully a little
harmless-looking man who had received
the news of conrad schumanns end as
though it was more or less all predestined
and for the best camilla didnt look
at craig allenby he had told nobody

of those uncertain hands of hers in the
mirror and it was a secret between them
he was a man who could keep a secret
like that until it faded from his memory
which would be very scon because she
was so unimportant to him

  id like to have gone away luxurious-
ly on the brantane she said go
down with my colors flying so to speak
-though even then theyd be your colors
wouldnt they i expect i shall do a lot
of harm in the vforld yet-once clear
of sinners castle which seems to cramp
my style she paused when do you
intend to finish your las bit of the psy-
chological experiment mr cobb i
mean to break off jans engagement to
you and hand her grace fully to craig

she moved away from them not wait-
ing for a reply she was dressed for
walking on the nearesi road six miles
away a jaunting car was to take her
back to civilization on her way to it
she would have to pass c ose to the preci-
pice at the foot of which the body of
conrad schumann had lain with the
falcons circling above him the peri-
scope of a british submarine was just
visible at the mouth of the lough where
it lay hopefully in wait for any other
u-boat that should bring other xjnter-
seekinder in but there would be none
jan knew  

  i wanted to see what allenby would
do said jethro cobb lifting jans hand
and taking the ring from her finger
he nearly took you from under my
nose in spite of what he owed me hed
still do it some day if i kept you thats
one of the things you cant play tricks
with    that irish skyways plane will
be here in time for you to get the night
boat i shall stay here for a while i
like the old place

  he nodded left them and went into
the doorway of cashel murtag like
one of the local pixies jan thought re-
turning to the underground again mod-
estly satisfied with its experiences but
finished with them now craig allenby
pulled her out of her chair a squadron
of seaplanes wheeled over the lough re-
turning to their carrier and their tiny
part in the grim game the world had
embarked upon sinners castle seemed
to ignore them with the kindly wisdom
of age which had seen many things pass

tiny david and the state police deal with
an international problem in this fine story-

by robert mill

o

ver

the border

tranquil lake normally a
quiet little town in northern
new york near the canadian
border broke into the headlines
with a bang

  a late spring morning dawned with
cloudless sunny skies three hours lat-
er this preview of delights to come un-
derwent a sudden and dramatic change
a storm came howling out of the north-
west with winds of almost unbelievable
velocity there were intermittent snow-
squalls during which the landscape was
virtually blotted out

  during the height of the storm the
residents of tranquil lakeheard but
could not see an airplane that was cir-
cling perilously close to the rooftops
then came a providential lull in the
snowfall the pilot sighted a field which
had been marked as an emergency land-
ing-place for mail-planes on the new
york-montreal run and he brought his
ship in to a workmanlike landing

  soon a goodly portion of the male pop-
ulation of tranquil lake was gathered
about the airplane which was a small
bomber of rather ancient design it was

equipped with skis for landing on snow
and it bore the insignia of the cana-
dian air-force beside the plane stood
two youths wearing the uniform of the
raf of england who were in canada
to receive advanced training at the air
schools established for the entire empire

  the younger of the air-men who ob-
viously was the pilot faced the assem-
bled crowd with a boyish smile of embar-
rassment

  i say you chaps what town is this

  tranquil lake came the chorus

  a hand reached inside the cabin of the
plane and produced a map soon a wor-
ried frown appeared

 my word thats in the united
states isnt it

  the assembled villagers assured him
that it was whereupon the pilot turned
to his companion

  sorry ronnie rather fancy ive
missed the wicket he shrugged but
for three hours the ground just wasnt
there you know and there was enough
wind-drift to take us to china he ad-
dressed the nearest native could you
tell me where i can place a trunk call 


  there was a hesitant silence then a
youth in the crowd came to the rescue
he means that he wants to make a
long-distance telephone-call

  quite so the pilot agreed

  there were willing volunteers and the
pilot turned to his companion

  stand by the crate will you ronnie 
ill be back in a jiffy

  a grunt of assent was the only answer
from the other air-man

in due time the pilot accompanied by
a throng of admirers returned he
lowered his voice as he said to his fellow
airman  ceiling zero almost everywhere
quite aside from that we have orders to
stay right here and notify the authori-
ties avoid international complications
and all that sort of rot he turned to
the crowd is there any officer about 
several men chuckled

  only a constable a man volun-
teered and hes sick in bed with the

grippe mostly when we want anything
like that we call the troopers

  a second voice came from the crowd
you dont have to bother about that
that louse hans schmict hot-footed it
for a telephone as soon as he saw this
was a canadian plane he was mutter-
ing something about get ting you guys
interned

  an angry murmur arose from the
crowd a middle-aged man whose face
bore a scar reminiscent of former battle-
fields acted as spokesman

  nothing doing you fellows stay
here until the storm lets up then you
beat it back to canada his manner
became belligerent id like to see any-
body stop you

  a roar of approval arose

  the boyish smile returned to the face
of the pilot

  thats frightfully decent of you
chaps however we have orders to face
the music	

if you interfere with
us somebody is going
to get hurt just keep
that in mind
 meanwhile one hans schmidt was
having a not altogether satisfactory ses-
sion with the telephone he first called
captain charles field commanding offi-
cer of the black horse troop new york
state police and stated his case cap-
tain field a man of pronounced likes
and dislikes found nothing in mr
schmidts name his accent or his re-
quest that caused him any pleasure he
made this very evidenas he gruffly in-
formed the tranquil lake man that the
canadian airplane was a federal prob-
lem and out of his jurisdiction cap-
tain field then volunteered the informa-
tion that quite aside from all that he
would be double-blanked if he would in-
tern any canadian airplane on the con-
trary he would send the air-men on their
way with his triple-blanked blessing and
a personal message for them to deliver to
a certain multiple-blanked gentleman in
europe who wore a misplaced eyebrow
mistakenly called a mustache

  the next person called was a federal
official here mr schmidt fared better
the federal man shared captain fields
sentiments but he also had a deep and
abiding respect for international law
therefore he assured his caller that the
matter would receive prompt attention

ten minutes later captain field still
in good voice was arguing the matter
out with the federal man

  it isnt how we feel about the thing
the federal official concluded we have
to stick to the law this thing will get
in the papers and there may be trouble
i havent anybody to send and im ask-
ing you to cooperate this is official
captain neither one of us can afford
to have washington down on his neck
captain field surrendered to the inevi-
table and hung up the telephone after
voicing his thoughts in a tone that flood-
ed the barracks and carried to the near-
by stables and garage he bawled for
lieutenant edward david

  mr david who was big enough to de-
serve the nickname of tiny appeared
almost at once captain field studied
his face as he outlined the case to him
mr david the commanding officer not-
ed with satisfaction looked even dumber
than usual which captain field regard-
ed as a hopeful sign

  there are no ifs ands or buts about
it the captain wound up you get
down there and grab that plane and its
crew the best minds will decide what
happens after that    that isnt our
party

  yes sir was mr davids only con-
tribution he saluted smartly and left
the office

  captain field gazed after him hope-
fully never knew him to do what he
was told he muttered an inspiration
came to him take crosby with you
he bawled he resumed his paper-work
growling put those two together and
theyre bound to make a botch of it 
lieutenant james crosby accepted the
assignment without enthusiasm he did
enliven the trip to tranquil lake with
conversation and his conversation dem-
onstrated that mr crosby had not tak-
en president roosevelts admonition re-
garding neutrality too seriously while
he lacked captain fields volume and
somewhat racy vocabulary he had a

  again fact follows fiction as we go to press
the newspapers report an actual forced landing of
canadian flyers-at alexandria bay new york
more vivid imagination and he devoted
it whole-heartedly to devising unpleas-
ant situations for the same mustached
gentleman captain field had mentioned

by the time they arrived at tranquil
lake the crowd had gained in size
they pushed their way through and con-
fronted the two british air-men there
was an interruption as a native addressed
the troopers

  the barracks have been calling you
guys they want you to get in touch
with them right away

  mr david turned to his companion
go see what theyre beefing about
will you jim  ill settle the war

  mr crosby departed in search of a
telephone while mr david spoke to the
pilot

  im lieutenant david of the state
police

  the youthful air-man extended his
hand leftenant geoffrey hardwich
raf he indicated his companion
leftenant ronald howard weve been
waiting for you i rather fancy weve
put our foot into it but it wasnt inten-
tional you know the storm blinded
us just what lies ahead leftenant
tiny david shook his head dubiously
i wouldnt know that lieutenant
our orders are to hold you and the plane
until what we jokingly call our best
minds announce the verdict its no ton-
ic to us all our sympathies are right
on your side of the fence he attempt-
ed a gruff bit of cheer even at worst
there are worse places than the united
states for the duration of the war

  the pilots face sobered

  quite but you see i had a brother
they shot him down the first week-
turned the machine-gun on him when he
was using his chute that makes a chap
anxious to get back and do his bit

  tiny davids face was grave

  it sure must make you feel that
way he agreed

  there was an awkward silence then
the british air-man shrugged

  fortunes of war leftenant

  the mian with the scar on his face
who had been listening attentively con-
fronted the trooper

  whats the dope  he demanded rath-
er truculently

  there isnt any dope tiny david
retorted we feel the same way you
do but were doing a job of work if
you interfere with us somebody is go-
ing to get hurt just keep that in mind

  the british pilot took part in the dis-
cussion 

  thanks a lot but the leftenant and
i understand each other

 the angry murmur from the crowd
subsided

  soon crosby returned struggling with
only partially suppressed excitement

  theres hell to pay at riverford he
began the ice is breaking up in the
river there is a jam about half a mile
below the town and the water is backing
up toward the viljge some of the
houses are flooded now the people are
trapped because the one dirt road that
leads out has been impassable for a
week they want dynamite to break the
jam but god knows how were going to
get it in to them

  tiny david frowned thoughtfully
they have sick and old people there
crosby continued and no way to get
them out hell tiny we cant stand
here and let them drown

  tiny david turned to the crowd
  any dynamite in town he asked

aprosperous-appearing middle-
aged man spoke up

  we carry quite a stock and youre
welcome to what you need he shook
his head dubiously but i cant see
how its going to help you any the
going is all right on the main road and
you have about thirty-five miles of that
then you have twenty-two miles on the
dirt road and that is impassable

  tiny david again turned to the crowd
anybody got a pair of snowshoes
theyll let me have

  crosby cut in you wont make it
tiny its a question of time the water
is backing up toward the town fast
the youthful british pilot looked up
from the map he had been studying

  are any of you chaps familiar with
the countryside near riverford

 reckon i am the answer came
from a man wearing the garb of a woods-
man been livin there for fifteen years
my wife and two kids are there right
now

  the pilot looked at him with sympathy
as he asked

  are there any open fields where a
plane might land 

  the woodsmans face was troubled
nary a one that i know of mister
theres thick timber all around the town
you might have been able to set her
down on the river but now the ice is go-
ing out
  the pilot f rowned

  if it was anything but dynamite he
mused we could drop it off with a
chute

  the silent observer made his first con-
tribution 

  bombs he pointed to the under-
belly of the airplane which was almost
buried in the snow three of them

  the pilots face brightened

  by jove trust good old ronnie to
come through his question was ad-
dressed to the crowd any chance of
getting some high-octane petrol

  the middle-aged man again was equal
to the occasion

  we stock aviation gas for the field
here we can fill up your tanks he
spied an employee in the crowd hey
pete

  the pilot was studying the snowy field

  how about you chaps turning to with
shovels and giving us a bit better run-
way 

  there was a rush for shovels the pi-
lot indicated a path he wished cleared
which ran diagonally from one far corner
of the field to the other the residents
fell to work wih a will

  i was afraid some of those drifts were
a bit too deep for our skis the pilot ex-
plained to tiny david bit of luck this
our problem today was a three-hundred-
mile cross-country flight then we were
supposed to spot a camouflaged target
and bomb it long before we reached
there our minds were on other things id
forgotten all about the blooming bombs
until good old ronnie spoke up

  tiny david turned from an inspection
of the leaden sky

  this is darned decent of you fellows

  the pilot waved his hand airily

  rot couldnt do anything else con-
sider ronnie and me on parole to return
here word of honor as officers and gen-
tlemen and that sort of thing

  tiny david grinned then his face
became serious  -

im afraid that wont do lieutenant

 we have to keep this on an official
basis youve been detained now i
have commandeered your plane natu-
rally i wouldnt send you on any errand
that i wouldnt do myself thats why
im going with you

  the pilots boyish smile which had
vanished as tiny david started to speak
reappeared

  i think i understand leftenant ev-
erything strictly official a twinkle ap-

he was muttering something about
getting you guys interned

peared in his eyes at the end of the
quarter you probably will receive a state-
ment from his majesty for ammunition
expended and that sort of thing he
turned to the observer think we can
find room for him ronnie

  a grunt was the answer then ronnie
reached inside the cabin and commenced
to remove superfluous gear

  bloody wireless-kit comes out he
growled confounded thing failed just
when we needed it most

  jim crosby pressed close to tiny
david

  how about me  he demanded

  sorry jim came the answer we
cant risk carrying any more dead weight
anyway there is a job for you here
after we get safely in the air you get
riverford on the telephone tell them
to keep everybody away from the river

  mr crosby yielded reluctantly

  soon the preparations were completed
and the airplane stood poised at the end
of the improvised runway its propellers
spinning as the pilot warmed up the mo-
tor for the take-off

  a ripple of interest went up from the
crowd as mr schmidt returned to the
field to observe at first hand the results of
his telephone activities one sight of the
airplane with its motor running sent him
hurrying to mr crosbys side

  vere dey go he demanded

  mr crosby hooked his thumbs in his
gun-belt as he surveyed his questioner

  my aunt sophronia is being buried to-
day the trooper explained and theyre
going to drop dandelions on the funeral
procession but dont wiggle out of your
undies theyll be back


the blue book magazine

  mr schmidts face was a vivid red
they be back yah yah you
make chokes not good chokes eider
better chokes than dat i can make 
mebbe so mr crosby admitted
but they have one dummy on the air
now and his sponsors cut his time in half
so i cant see much future for you
inside the cabin of the plane the pilot
turned to his passengers

  all hands ready  right-o

  he gunned the motor the ship quiv-
ered he released the brakes the plane
roared down the runway

  tiny david glanced at the pilot the
british youths face grew terise as the end
of the runway neared and the ship showed
no inclination to leave the ground the
end of the runway was almost at hand
the pilot pulled back on the wheel the
plane took a false hop and then entered
the air

  the usually silent ronnie glanced down
at the tree-tops

  two feet tq spare was his verdict

  the ship slowly gained altitude nos-
ing upward into a dutl leaden sky then
the snow-squalls began anew the pilot
checked his instruments against his map
there was a smile on his face as he said
a bit dusty what

  tiny david was growing accustomed to
the roar of the motor soon he realized
that the taciturn ronnie was singing he
caught a fragment of the song jolly
boating weather-

  the pilot grinned

  ronnie always sings he explained
mum as a clam on the ground but a
regular chatterbox soon es we get up-
stairs

  they caught only fleeting glimpses of
the earth as the flight continued the
pilots eyes were glued on the instrument-
board ronnie tiny david noted now
was engaged in vocally hanging his
washing on the siegfried line

  visibility cleared momentarily tiny
david peering downward caught a fleet-
ing glimpse of riverforci and pointed
excitedly

  right-o came the calm reply from
the pilot all set ronnie 

  very good said ronnie

  the plane began to circle steadily los-
ing altitude now the streets of the vil-
over te

 lage were visible and they could distin-
 guish men and women all looking aloft
 the river came into view it was com-
 paratively easy to spot the ice-jam

   nature using turbulent waters and
 huge cakes of ice had done a job that
 would have done credit to almost any
 engineer the great cakes of ice had
 formed a perfect dam behind that bar-
 rier was an immense and steadily widen-
 ing sea of water one side of which now
 had advanced well into the town

   the pilot banked sharply and pulled
 the plane into a series of spirals above the
 ice-jam ronnie was busy over his bomb-
 ing-sights he made hasty calculations
 then he spoke into his phones

   north by east one thousand feet
 air speed one hundred

    right-o

    the plane turned and retraced its path
  then came another dizzy turn tiny
  david caught only fleeting glimpses of
  the ice barrier through the swirling snow-
  flakes

   the ship seemed to tiny david to be
 some distance from the dam when ron-
 nie tugged at a control the trooper
 peering downward saw a geyser of wa-

	ter and ice fragments a short distance to
 the right and away from the riverford
 side of the dam

   sorry murmured the pilot my
 fault ronnie

   the ship headed back for the second
 try

    north by east came ronnies direc-
 tions eight hundred feet air speed
 eighty-five

    good old ronnie the pilot approved
 shading it a bit close only two left
 cant waste them he shouted into

border

tiny davids ear hold tight this
may toss us about a bit

  again the ship approached the dam
the nose of the plane went downv once
more ronnie pulled the control
ah-h-h-h

  directly above the center of the ice
dam there was a cloud of water and flying
debris the ship rocked violently from
side to side it shivered furiously the
roar of the motor had increased as the
pilot fighting the controls sought to get
out of the concussion caused by the ex-
plosion

  the ship regained an even keel the
pilot smiled theres life in the old
girl yet  he said

  they circled about watching the black
and white torrent pour through the open-
ing caused by the bomb huge cakes of
ice caught up by the current dashed in-
to the gap and thundered against the bar-
riers that remained on both sides

  once more said the pilot take
out whats left on the village side
right-o came the reply from ron-
nie again he repeated his instructions
a third time the plane approached the
dam ronnie had found the range the
bomb sped straight to its target the
river was open it was only a question of
time until the flood would subside

ronnie leaned forward

 i would land two out of three when
no instructor was around 

  the pilot chuckled then his face
sobered as he turned to tiny david
back we go what

  they flew low over the town grateful
residents waved coats and cloths at the
passing plane the pilot dipped one wing
in salute then they mounted into the
winter sky

  tiny david had the map in his hands
no use to take a chance on that field
at tranquil lake again he shouted his
finger indicated a spot on the map
head for lineville they have a real
airport there

  the pilot leaned over to study the map
an expression of surprise crossed his face
the surprise was replaced by puzzlement

  sure you want us to land there he
demanded

  tiny davids face was guileless

  very sure good town lineville we
have a patrol there they will fix us up
in fine style

  the pilot shrugged   

the plane made short distance of the
miles and soon they were circling above
over the border

lineville tiny davids finger indicated
the airport which was some distance
from the village and in a northerly direc-
tion

  the ship lost altitude slowly and came
in to a professional landing airport em-
ployees gathered about them among
the group was a man wearing the uniform
of the canadian customs a uniformed
immigration inspector of the same coun-
try joined him

  the pilot snapped off the motor and
turned to tiny david

  i cant feel too badly about this
leftenant the map showed that line-
villes airport was on our side of the line
you ordered me to land here alls fair
in love and war you know

  tiny davids expression of bewilder-
ment almost qualified him for the stage

  thats right he muttered the air-
port is in canada funny that i didnt
remember that

  the british youth eyed him keenly

  i think i understand what ronnie
and i feel is a bit difficult to put into
words but we want you to know-

  tiny david cut him short

  just a bonehead play of a dumb state
cop he declared much better that
way no international complications
your plane was commandeered and you
obeyed orders he extended his hand
when you get across i hope you do the
same sort of work on the ice-jams over
there 

  he turned away made a brief explana-
tion to the canadian officials and entered
a waiting taxicab

the next morning tifty david sat
across the desk from captain field
who looked unusually glum

  albany said the commanding of-
ficer has been heard from major har-
ner is on record officially to the effect that
he is ashamed that one of his men didnt
know the difference between the united
states and canada still in his official
capacity he has ordered me to discharge
that man i always obey orders just
before you came in here i had the clerk
send this message to the major on the
teletype trooper joseph zilch is no
longer a member of the black horse
troop the major is perfectly satisfied

  captain fields eyes twinkled

  unofficially major harner gave me a
message for you its just three words
well done tiny  

       another story of tiny david
       will appear in an early issue

a british corre-
spondent sends a
graphic story of
war-time flying

    ecause i am a sailor i am more
concerned with the fleet air arm
jlj than the royal air force the
fleet air arm was originally a branch of
the raf but eventually it became a
part of the navy it lives chiefly in air-
craft carriers but there are also squad-
rons that have been landed on parts of the
british coast where they work in con-
junction with the air force patrolling sec-
tions of the north sea it was to one of
these squadrons that i recently paid a
visit to gain first-hand experience of the
life of a fighting pilot in war

  the plane that carried me to the far
north flew low along the coast because
visibility was bad but it was clear
enough to see the wild highlands spread
out in contours of russet ar d green

  at length we came to a headland with
rain-squalls drifting in from the sea and
the plane in which i was a passenger cir-
cled and came down taxying across a
level field

  through the rain hangars and rows
of huts showed up against the sky we
pulled on gum-boots and splashed toward
them through seas of mud churned up by
lorries and all the traffic of the camp
the raf bombing machines and the
fleet air arm fighters were drawn up in
rows across the aerodrome looking like
gigantic browsing insects

  in a bare room warmed lay an oil-stove
half a dozen pilots sat awaiting the sum-
mons to go up if visibility should sud-
denly clear one played patience on an
ammunition-box another frowned over a
crossword puzzle two talked strad-
dling their chairs another paced thought-
fully up and down the mud iy board floor
the observers were in flying kit their hel-
mets and parachute harness hanging from
the walls they were all young men two
of them very young-midshipmen in fact
we sat and talked

   i seem to remember in th e last war that
there was a good deal of rather macabre
gayety among the fighting pilots in touch

real experience see page

by bartimeus

 with the enemy eat drink and be
 merry for tomorrow we die stuff they
 made ceaseless jokes about death

   none of that was in this hut smelling
 of paraffin and tea and tobacco with the
 rain beating against the window-frames
 the young faces looked soberly cheerful
 much the same expression as you would
 see in a changing-room on a school play-
 ing-field before a rather important foot-
 ball match jokes there were in plenty
 but they werent about death

   they talked fighting tactics and one
 of the midshipmen revealed that he had
 recently shot down a german bomber
 after a grim game of touch-last in a range
 of cloud mountains out over the north
 sea the homing raider dived and banked
 and dodged from one cloud-valley to an-
 other trying to shake off the pursuit
 he kept going from one cloud to an-

	other for cover till i got to know his
 trick said the boy everybody has one
 trick i got ahead and gave him a burst
 at two hundred yards as he came out of
 a cloud his face sobered the hunt
 is grand fun but when you see the poor
 devils spinning down in a nose-dive on
 fire-not so funny  he ended gravely

   theyre really awfully young some of
 them said another stripling i got a
 days leave and flew over to see a couple
 in the hospital at-

   why i asked

   the speaker loo ed embarrassed oh
 just to take them some cigarettes and
 chocolates and that kind of thing

   were you responsible for their being
 in hospital

   he nodded i think actually my gun-
 ner shot them down nice kids they
 asked me to go and stay with them in
 germany after the war

 as it turned out there was no flying
  that day but in the dawn next
 morning the aerodrome sounded as if the
 bulls of bashan were roaring together as
 the fighters were warmed through in the

pilots hut the observers of the flight go-
ing up were pulling on their flying-kits
the pilots cockpit is warmed a pilot
rarely bothers about more than helmet
and parachute harness but the observer
in the rear has nothing to warm him but
the kit he wears

  i was taking the place of an observer
in this flight and had borrowed his kit
first i struggled into a combination suit
like the skin of a teddy bear on top of
that goes a wind-proof combination sui
with a high collar lined with fleece then
comes a life-saving waistcoat this can
be inflated in a few moments by the
wearer and for some obscure reason is
known technically as a mae west the
parachute harness buckles on over this
it is a cumbersome arrangement to walk
about in but i can imagine moments
when it gives considerable moral sup-
port lastly there is a flying-helmet with
telephone mouthpiece and earphone at-
tachments gauntlet gloves and fleece-
lined flying boots

  one by one burdened by our harness
we went squelching through the mud to
the landing-ground where the fighters
were drawn up each pilot and observ-
er walked to their allotted machine two
of them stopped to exchange a remark in
the deafening roar of the slip-stream
where normal speech is of course an im-
possibility the speaker reached out for
the tube of the others headphone and
spoke into it the observer did the same
and they both laughed they were finish-
ing a conversation that started in the
hut we climbed up into our cockpits

  one of the maintenance personnel
climbed up after me and tested the
switches of the wireless telephone and
the release-gear of the gun he was a
cheerful person with a red face and drops
of moisture on his eyebrows he wished
me a happy landing and disappeared
over the edge of the cockpit

  a bank of gray low-lying cloud hung
overhead beyond the edge of the cliffs

real experiemcei

                                  
real experiences

the sea was visible with a silvery bright-
ness to the eastward a cold wind came
from the hills carrying a scent of heath-
er and wisps of rain the roaring of the
engines grew a little louder the ground
flowed bumpily away beneath us turned
in a wide circle and receded

  by the time i had finished fiddling
about with my straps and switches and
trays of ammunition and looked over the
side the ground was far beneath us and
it was doing queer things tilting on edge
a bit so that a mare and her foal in a
field seemed to be grazing at a most im-
possible angle then i saw the surf be-
neath us and there was an icy rushing
wind that sang in the wires and a queer
feeling of lightness in my stomach

  the other fighters were flying in a
v-formation on either side of us rising
and dipping slightly as if riding on the
surface of an invisible sea the real sea
far beneath us was visible for a while
and then faded as we began climbing
above the clouds they stretched be-
neath us for all the world like an arctic
panorama the sea showed through
them thousands of feet below in little
dark streaks rifts in a white floor re-
sembling pack-ice cloud-mountains in
the far distance were catching the first
rays of the rising sun

  the altitude produced a curious feel-
ing of detachment it seemed impos-
sible to recapture any emotion neither
love or hate lived in that cold clear noth-
ingness-only peace and the rushing
wind of our passage blue sky above and
white light gleaming on the cloud-floor
beneath

  the voice of the pilot buzzed in my
earphone keep a good look-out

  it recalled our mission to me some-
where out of the cloud-mountains to the
southeast or out of the blue of space a
speck might appear or a cluster of specks
-and death would be abroad in that sun-
ny emptiness it seemed queer to think
of death up in that nirvana

we climbed on the sense of peace
was succeeded by a rather nauseat-
ing faintness as we neared the oxygen
limits the thermometer showed eight
degrees below zero i glanced at the al-
titude indicator to take my mind off the
swaying faintness i tried to calculate
how many miles we were above the sea
i sighted the gun at imaginary assailants
searched the sky and clouds through
glasses wondered what sort of shooting
id do when my sensations were those of

a man bleeding to death decided death
would be rather a pleasant release

  hold your nose warned the pilot
and down we dived with red-hot needles
stabbing our cracking eardrums down
through space into blessed oxygen and
the comparative warmth of mere freezing-
point we met our reliefs coming out to
take over the patrol nothing to re-
port flashed an observer and they went
past us climbing to the ceaseless aerial
beat over the north sea

that afternoon i found myself alone
with one of the fighting pilots it was
the midshipman who had shot down a
bomber after chasing it through the
clouds he told me that his father had
been in codys circus and how he him-
self had wanted to fly since he was about
five he had gone straight from school
to flying instruction and thence to the
fleet air arm he was twenty

  i made some mention of the lights on
the cloud-floor that morning and he told
me of a sunset he had once seen he was
on detached patrol above the clouds and
he found himself flying on and on through
unearthly radiance and colors that were
never on land or sea coming back was
like waking from sleep and some lovely
incommunicable dream he said

  it was worth having lived to see it
not long previously he had experienced
engine-trouble when on patrol over the
north sea and came planing down from
ten thousand feet in the direction of a
trawler he remembered seeing earlier he
hit the water at ninely-mile speed slap
into a fifteen-foot swell about three miles
from the trawler another fighter in his
patrol saw him dive and followed him
through the clouds to attract the at-
tention of the trawlers crew to the dam-
aged plane her consort fired a burst of
machine-gun fire the trawlers crew
decided that they were being attacked by
a german machine and stayed below

  in the meantime the machine still
floated the pilots hand was jammed
in a bit of mechanism anchoring him by
the wrist to a plane that might cock up
its tail and dive to the bottom the ob-
server having failed to free him set off
to swim to the trawler for help supported
by his mae west and they were both
picked up by the trawler none the worse

  i heard last week that this boy the
youngest fighting pilot in the fleet air
arm had been killed on active service
i am glad he saw that sunset it was so
worth living to have seen

jo uareg

tomb

a battle-adventure with the strange veiled people
of the sahara

by john paar-cabrera

i

t was late in the afternoon the ir-
regular meharistes of the goum-all
high-caste veiled touareg of the kel
rhea and imeraan tribes-loomed like
faceless and floating ghosts through the
flurries of whirling sand which hid their
shuffling camels

  how far is the oasis where inarti is
waiting for us i shouted to the scout
who had just returned to the squadron

  we are getting near to it but in-
arti may allah preserve him has much
pain-here the scout shouted back
pounding his breast you prize inartis
advice dont you sidi 

  nobody knows the sahara better than
he i replied

  true the scout confirmed but
inshallah hes past fifty-has been in
numberless con bats  for more than
thirty years he sat in the rhala saddle
and for thirty years i mused he
swallowed the impalpable sand that is
in the air of the desert i hope the sand
has not finally eaten his lungs away
for i had seen a few middle-aged
touareg warriors and chaamba arabs
all straight leathery fellows suddenly
topple vomiting blood anddie in a few
minutes victims of the sudden hemor-
rhage which tears the worn-out lungs of
the veteran desert riders

  the storm subsided and loud bleats
of our camels which were smelling the
water of the wells warned us that we
were about to reach the oasis

  it was a green patch of a few score
palm trees surrounded by the usual wall
of sun-hardened mud a square building
with a round roof unmistakably a mara-
bouts tomb was in the very middle

  why did inarti pick such a place for
a camp  i shouted angrily

  the tomb is empty the scout re-
plied the pious hermit for whom it
was built was carried away by a party
of reguibat marauders who wanted to
profit from the neighborhood of his
blessed person and died in far-away
mauritania inarti was in this same
oasis many years ago and knows that no
evil spirits hover at night around the
corpseless tomb

  in the oasis i had just got out of the
saddle of my squatting camel when inarti
came to greet me straight as a rod clad
in a glistening black takarbast tunic and
with a black cloth wrapped tightly around
head and face he was an awesome figure

  bismillaten  seven blessings on you
sidi

  peace be with you why did you not
tell me this morning that your chest was
bothering you all the hard riding as
leader of the scouts should have been
done by chekkou

  why sidi  allah is the only life-
giver and dispenser of happiness to the
souls of the faithful but in this world
destiny rules everything

  the beams of the setting sun covered
with a golden haze the sandy ridges the
shallow valleys between the dunes were
purplish and restful to look at and the
fierce heat of the day was subsiding

  sidi inarti unexpectedly said i
rode out of our post with you to defeat
the raiders of tegama the air chief and
i swear that until your task is done i
shall stand by you and help you

  but he had hardly finished speaking
when he jerked his head back and slapped


real experiences

both hands on the black cloth covering his
mouth

  shunning the helping hands of the me-
haristes who hastened to support him
inarti squatted on the damp ground and
bowed his head while the blood seeped
thickly through his black face-veil and
dripped between his open knees into an
ever-widening pool

  honor the brave get his takouba
and rifle chekkou shouted

  inartis eyes-the disconcerting eyes
of a high-caste targui with large yellow
pupils ringed by blue rims-opened wide
when his weapons were placed before
him there were deep marks filled in
with brass slivers on the flat butt of the
spear on the stock of the carbine and on
the heavy pommel of the sword and each
of these marks symbolized an enemy
slain in single combat

  it was only when inarti began swaying
from side to side-to interfere before then
would have been misinterpreted as the
kind of courtesy due to a woman in trou-
ble and therefore as an insult-that i
knelt at his side and helped him to lie
down but when his awesome eyes glazed
over his head lay on my cupped hands

  all the meharistes of the squadron vol-
unteered to prepare inartis body for
burial i selected four of them who had
been his close friends for years

then i went to inspect the oasis
near the tomb i found a tent and four
chaamba arabs three wiry young fel-
lows and a patriarch who stroked end-
lessly his matted beard

  as you can see we are peaceful shep-
herds the patriarch wheezed after the
customary greetings pointing to a herd
of goats ruminating in a makeshift pen

  one of the young chaamba had been
preparing the ceremonial minted tea he
took the pot containing the brew off the
fire and filling two tall lead cups offered
one of them to me and the other to the
old man who took a long gulp of the hot
liquid smacked his lips and looked ex-
pectantly at me

  i quickly reflected that had there been
anything wrong with the tea he would
not have touched it i drained my cup

  i felt unusually spent and listless when
i went to look at the camp the meharistes
were pitching among the groves with
my shoulders propped against the scaly
trunk of a palm i wondered if i was be-
ing overcome by a sudden attack of fever

  it was almost dark when chekkou
came to squat beside me

  sidi-his voice sounded faint as if
coming from a distance-i sent out the
usual cordon of far-flung lookouts the
sentries have been duly posted and yet
everything is wrong

  why  i stammered weakly

  the oasis is here chekkou explained
sticking a finger into the soft damp
ground then he traced a ring around
the mark symbolizing the oasis and
here is the outlying wall watched by the
inner cordon of sentries

  and these he continued after a
pause digging a series of dots all around
the drawing are the lookouts watching
the approaches to the oasis and to our
camp

  what are you getting at with all this
mummery  i snapped peevishly

  with a sweeping motion of his hands
chekkou effaced all the marks

  during the night he growled the
scouts and the sentries will slink back to
the pitched tents and the goum will be at
the mercy of a surprise attack and all
because while you were drinking tea two
chaamba were telling our men that al-
though the tomb is empty a swarm of
bori the lowest and most cruel of evil
spirits congregate in the oasis at night
rot  i muttered thickly the sim-
ple fact that the four chaamba settled in
this oasis proves they dont believe that it
is infested by any kind of ghosts

  sidi the chaamba say they are pro-
tected by some bags containing kor-
anic verses which were once dipped into
an oil blessed by one of the four thousand
saints of allah who roarr the earth in dis-
guise

  our men are fools to believe that i
growled and you are a halfwit because
you didnt tell me all this ghastly rigma-
role before sending out the lookouts and
pitching the tents

  sidi i thought that the old man had
warned you  i believed you knew of
some way of conjuring off the devils
spent and befuddled i was but my
knowledge of saharan mentality still
stood me in good stead thus i realized
that i was up against the stone wall of
tribal superstition and that it was no use
arguing several things had to be done
and quickly the scouts had to be re-
called and the mehara saddled the
camp finally had to bf pitched several
miles away from the oasis

  but it wasnt before i could open my
mouth to give the necessary orders all
became dark  then there was a deep roar
in my ears and i lost consciousness


the touareg tomb

    i shall never know when my fainting
  spell gave way to deep sleep but it must
  have been nearly dawn when i began to
  dream of inarti

     in the nightmare the body of the dead
  targui headman had wasted and of it
  only a gigantic skeleton remained a face
  veil was wrapped around his skull and
  jaws a pale glow shone in his empty
  eye-sockets and under the litham veil
  his fleshless mouth was uttering an unin-
  telligible message i stammered

    my friend i dont understand what
  youre saying cant you give me some
  sign of what you mean 

    at that one of inartis arms slowly
  raised inch by inch his skeleton claw
  slid toward my shoulder which became
  numb and cold

  i woke with a jerk and instantly found
  out that no superhuman agency had
  benumbed my muscles whoever had
  carried me under a tent had made a pillow
  out of my folded burnous and placed my
  automatic under it but the gun had
  slipped out and lay under my shoulder

    i arose cursing-and in that very mo-
  ment hell broke loose in the oasis vol-
  leys crashed deaf eningly and there came

	hair-raising screams of ul-ul allah
  akbar and jihad jihad

     when i stepped out of the tent a swish-
  ing huge sword almost decapitated me i
  hastily leaped back bringing my sword-
  blade up in the next split second i saw a
  veiled head and an enormous pair of
  shoulders covered by a white takarbast
  -the white tunic of an air raider-
  framed in the opening of the tent i
  lunged and at the same time pressed the
  trigger of the automatic in my left hand
  the tribesman fell facedown into the tent

    when i went out a full moon and the
  angry stars of the african sky threw so
  much light on the oasis that all details of
  the combat were as clearly visible as if it
  had been daytime the raiders had come
  in two waves the first had reached un-
  noticed the wall surrounding the oasis
  and had swarmed within the sentries
  who had been driven practically on top
  of the tents by fear of ghosts had made a
  stand but had been slaughtered to a man

    my meharistes however were ahag-
  gar touareg of a breed which is as brave
  as the air but quicker of wits as soon
  as they had been awakened by the noise
  of the fight they had grasped their weap-
  ons and leaped out of the tents their
  rush had driven back the first swarm of
  tribesmen but the second squadron of

the half-breed warriors of tegama were
leaping pell-mell over the wall and join-
ing the melee

  guns roared sword-blades flashed dul-
ly in the moonlight blue-clad ahaggar
touareg recognizable as meharistes by
their bandoliers charged and were coun-
terattacked ferociously by the black-
limbed white-clad air touareg

  under the trunks of the palm trees they
tore at each other in confused masses of
battering arms kicking legs and bobbing
veiled heads the irrigation ditches were
jammed with wrestling rolling and stab-
bing tribesmen to make matters worse
several of the camels of the goum had
broken loose and now were running at
random indiscriminately biting friends
and foes and everywhere-out in the
open partially concealed in holes in the
ground sprawled under the deep shadow
of the branches the strewn bodies of the
dead lay like shapeless heaps of cloth

  i brought my whistle to my mouth and
i blew a sharp blast the nearest me-
haristes and air tribesmen instantly con-
verged on me it was a good fight fast
and furious and i still carry a memory
of it in the form of two scars on the left
side of my head then the moment came
when i had a small band of a dozen me-
haristes with me and a clear path to the
heap of saddles and bags in whose midst
our two machine-guns were located

  i retrieved these weapons but i had
only four meharistes with me when i suc-
ceeded in reaching a neutral corner close
to the eastern wall of the oasis

  a party of raiders suddenly turned let
loose a volley and charged one of their
bullets hit and upset the machine-gun
placed before immakitane who was the
tallest man of the goum a veritable giant
but i pressed the trigger of the machine-
gun of which i had taken personal charge

  a few minutes later it was all over i
stopped firing the air closest to the
eastern section of the wall i allowed to
get away the others asked loudly the
aman the permission to surrender with
guarantee of life

  however half of the raiding party were
already dead in the oasis foremost
among them was a corpse bedecked with
heavy golden bracelets the body of te-
gama the chieftain who had led a horde
of warriors of the air highlands across
some four hundred miles of untracked
wilderness for the sake of pillaging in the
stamping-grounds of the ahaggar tou-
areg who are the age-old enemies of the
touareg of the air


the touareg tomb

  as the prisoners readily confessed the
chaamba were the allies of tegama
they had taken me in by the crudest of
ruses-by placing a soporific powder in
the bottom of the cup which was after
filled by tea and given to me that was
the reason the graybeard had drunk so
freely-inwardly gloating no doubt at
the thought that soon i would be seized
by tegama who had sworn to tear the
heart out of the breast of a live roumi
officer with his own hands

  instead death overtook him and the
three younger chaamba at the very be-
ginning of the combat when they were
caught in the cross-fire of the air and the
meharistes

  forty meharistes had been wounded
but luck assisting only twelve had been
killed their bodies and inartis were
buried in individual graves in touareg
style their knees drawn under their
breasts their weapons tied in bundles
and large boulders bearing their names
carved in the punic characters of the
written touareg language were placed
on their graves in the middle of horse-
shoes of stones open toward the east

  but as a special mark of deference it
was over inartis grave that a few stanzas
of the first fatah and the prayers of the
dead were recited by a high-caste mehar-
iste who had been tutored by one of the
rare philosophers and koranic students
of the ahaggar then i personally com-
manded the squad that fired the ritual
volleys over the graves

  with this final military salute topping
a touareg burial inarti ag belhad
imeman headman and acting-sergeant of
meharistes became but one of the mem-
ories of the desert

like all other men with a realistic turn
a of mind i dont believe in ghosts
i know that science recognizes telepathy
the transference of thought-but only on
condition that the transmitting and the
receiving brain are both alive

  thus while i have no doubt that with-
out the disconcerting dream in which
inartis vision played the leading role i
would have probably been caught half-
asleep and either murdered in my tent or
captured i must perforce attribute my
very close escape to sheer luck

  however i shall never forget that a few
moments before his death inarti solemn-
ly swore to help me and stand by me until
tegama and his fierce raiders were rout-
ed and that in some uncanny way fate
made good his promise

i had always thought war would be
grand and i was always sad that
i was too young to train for it before
it came but ten days after the ger-
mans had marched into my village near
poznan i received a uniform and a gun
and orders to proceed to a certain wood
where i would receive instructions

  it was sometimes difficult to get along
fast enough a train would start and
stop-stop for so long it seemed as though
it might never start again and so it
might be quicker to go on foot then
in the long nights peasants would let one
sleep on their carts filled with turnips or
potatoes one could lie full length and
it was not too cold in those early days
we had no rations so that we had to de-
pend on the peasants to feed us

  when i reached the village near the
wood i found it blackened incendiary
bombs had started three fires and there
was not a house left or hut left i had
hoped for a real meal here as the four
days since i left home had produced only
scrappy food but there was a well and
so at least i had a long drink

  all the fields immediately around the
village were burnt too but in the end i
found a family sleeping in a distant field
they said it was not bombing that had
set the village alight at all-that a man
had dropped out of a plane with a para-
chute he had been armed and asked
for information about troop movements
obviously suspecting that this was near a
recruiting station when no one would
tell him anything he got very angry and
said they would all be sorry the next
morning they were badly bombed and in
the night the fires broke out cows and
hens were burned and ten of the wounded
from the air-raid could not be moved out
in time to be saved

  there was a big house five kilometers
away so i went there and found only two
women servants and the lady of the
house she was packing a few things
and was glad to see me and to hear that
i was a real polish soldier these men
from airplanes wear polish uniforms and
foldier of pol and

a story of the german invasion as told to an english visitor-

by casimir wiertz

they speak our tongue so well that peo-
ple start being suspicious of anyone they
do not know the reason she was par-
ticularly glad to see me was that there
was a big statue that her son had brought
from an eastern country which she
wanted to save she said it was a won-
derful god she wanted to throw it into
the pond and it was too heavy for her to
lift so i carried it out and waded deep
into the water and pushed it out of my
arms it was not at all a polish face
but it seemed to smile contentedly as
it disappeared under the water the mud
is deep in that pond however long the
war lasts that is a treasure the ger-
mans will never find

  then the lady asked me if i could
drive a cart for her and her women as
they must leave at once and i said i
would of course her young son was
waiting for her in the forest on his horse
she said and would take over from me
when we reached him

  we started out and had gone some lit-
tle way when i heard a strange clanking
sound behind the trees on the right be-
ing in uniform i jumped at once into
a ditch to take cover and i had just got
down when round the corner across the
forest came a great engine that i knew
must be a tank it waddled out onto
the road and then stopped then the
whole top seemed to be lifting itself
open and i crouched as hard as i could
under the thin little bush in the ditch

 then i heard a gun go pop-pop-
pop-pop-pop-ancliwo screams then
more clanking and the engine made
straight across the ditch in which i lay
but no one saw me and after a few min-
utes i got out and found the cart across
the road at right angles the horse lying
in the shafts dead two of the women
quite dead and the lady sitting exactly
as i had left her looking straight in front
of her but with blood pouring from her
forearm and leg

  i did not know what to do so ran back
to the last village we had passed two
peasant women came back with me and



an old man when we got back to the
cart the lady was also dead so i went
back with these people who said i must
have food but this only made me very
sick so i lay down till the evening when
a band of polish soldiers marched through
and took me with them and so in the
end came to cracow

we were in a lot of battles after we
joined up with the army but i was
always lucky not getting wounded and
then we started fighting a retreat as our
general said he would never surrender
one man alive and one day i found my-
self in a steep wooded country quite
alone not knowing quite how i had got
there i threw myself down and fell
asleep and when i woke up the sun was
quite high and there was not a sound of
a voice or a footstep i had got used to
living in a crowd and this silence was a
very frightening thing i got up think-
ing if i followed my nose to the top of
the hill i would be able to see the lie of
the land then i thought it would be
better to try and get to the bottom of the
valley where i might find a river to
guide me at least i would have some-
thing to drink and i might even catch
small fish by tickling them under the
water as i had loved to do as a small boy

  i spent two nights and days wander-
ing like this and it really was a relief to
be captured by a troop of russian sol-
diers though at first i could not under-
stand what this was all about as we had
never heard a word of our having any
except german armies to fight i spoke
a little russian and understood quite a
good bit more as i had relations living
in the east of poland where i spent my
summer holidays every year but i did
hot tell them i understood at all

  i was so tired and dirty it was not dif-
ficult to pretend to understand nothing
at all when they said the war was over
and that they had won and that as i was
not an officer it would not be at all bad
for me all this time they were walk-
ing me toward a village when we reached

it i realized that i had got to within an
hour of the carpathian frontier

 they took my gun from me i had
no ammunition so this was not much
loss and they looked through all my
pockets they gave me bread and cheese
and a jug of water and all sat around
and watched me as i ate and drank rav-
enously they were arguing what to do
with me and finally decided to keep me
in a room which they could watch sit-
ting outside this cafe until someone
turned up in the village with a better
idea the room was dirty and vermin
were literally swarming everywhere

  that night two drunks were shut up
with me so that i was glad when a clat-
ter on the road proved to be a platoon
of soldiers whose officer ordered that i
should be taken off after dinner and en-
trained for stanislawow

the prison in stanislawow was full of
poles it was wonderful to be with
friends again there were a thousand
rumors and much bitterness at the way
the marshal had deserted his polish
army but everyone said that the fight-
ing of the poles was magnificent when-
ever they were given anyone to fight
and everyones main idea was to escape
into rumania or hungary and so to
france or somewhere where a polish
army was being formed every man in
that prison had an astonishing story to
tell of things which he had seen or suf-
fered there were two women in the
prison whom the russians had not sus-
pected in their uniform

  the room i slept in had a high window
but not inaccessible and as soon as i
saw the warders did not bother to close
it i felt i must try to escape that way
the others told me there were so many
soldiers with fixed bayonets all around
the building that such an effort was sui-

cide but i did not like the prison fare
of dry bread and water and felt i must
make a try before i lost strength

  so that the second night two friends
gave me a leg-up i squeezed my body
out took one look out and saw water
under me how deep i did not know
the window was about eight meters
from the surface i let go of the window-
edge and my body scrabbled down into
water with a splash which i felt must
surely be heard for kilometers around 
was waist-deep when at last i found my
footing and moved cautiously down-
stream

  i had no idea where the prison build-
ing lay in relation to the down would
downstream take me in or out of the
inhabited district after fifty yards of
wading close under cover of the bank i
ventured to crawl out and found that
luck was with me i was leaving the
town but the water seemed the safest
place for my bank was in shadow

  i worked two to three hours down the
waterway before venturing out into the
meadows again twice passing close to
hamlets on the bank my heart stopped
at the barking of dogs who heard my
steps even under cover of the gurgling
water

  i felt sure this stream must lead down
to the frontier river eventually-the
lovely dniester for five days and nights

i	followed the stream lying hidden by
day venturing twice to peasant huts to
ask food and guidance and finally a
change of clothes dressed in dirty white
old linen trousers and a coarse shirt i
risked longer treks and even at two
larger villages i slouched lazily through
without any challenge right across the
marketplace

  it was sunday when i reached the
frontier there was a wooden church
within one hundred meters of the river

i	would have liked to go to mass but i
was afraid that the russians were al-
ready persecuting the devout so for this
day i waited for darkness to visit the
shrine just outside

  the hot dry summer had narrowed the
river-bed and at no place did it come
much over my waist the crossing was
a simple matter within twenty-four
hours i was arrested by rumanian of-
ficials who were quite kindly and sent
me to an internment camp about a hun-
dred kilometers outside of bucharest

  after two months there i was sent for
given tickets and visas and now am in
a training-camp somewhere in france

i leapt as the boat

was gone shivering
with cold i shouted in

 after hours of torture the night became stormy and the tug skipper
 shortened his line again i shouted-and this time a flashlight on the tug picked
