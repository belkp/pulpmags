we later-day didderingtons have
had no particular reason to
refer back to july  
with enthusiasm

  at the time of which i write-sep-
tember  g- i was the only one of
the name and was not terribly proud
of the distinction under the circum-
stances the explanation of which is
an awful fag but must be got over
with if the rest of the stuff i am going
to write is to have any sense at all

  your revolution had nothing to do
with it but upon the day you decided
to lick us and your lithographers be-
gan to turn out the annual supply of

    i s

george washingtons my great-great-
grandfather the eighth earl of did-
derington was born

  he is really responsible for this
story

  from birth to marriage and thence
to death he was a deuce of a chap-
a rotter-fond of dueling with people
he could kill of gambling and drink-
ing and of other mens wives

  didderington families have always
been small like myself he was an
only child and i suppose being heir
to an earldom there were not a few
marriageable ladies who found it pos-
sible to overlook his beastly habits in
any case one foolish woman married
him

  they had two children a son and a


the all-story magazine

daughter who were four and two
years of age respectively when their
father came into the title in 

  he played ducks and drakes with
everything his wife died in 
literally killed by his brutality and in
the same year his daughter refusing
to be payment for one of his horrible
gambling debts to some roue who
wanted to marry her left didder ing-
ton park very suddenly one evening
with bob dolliver the lodgekeepers
son and neither was ever seen or
heard of again

  the earl died as he had lived -
swiftly-in  some say a wom-
an shot him in revenge for a particu-
larly devilish trick he had played upon
her or hers

  the facts are clouded but in any
case he was found lying upon his face
inside the main entrance gate of the
park with an ugly bullet hole in the
back of his head

  but there was little relief in that for
the didderington exchequer

  his son---brother of the girl who
ran away - was just as much of an
ass as the father though in a different
way he married a woman who took
charge of his check-book and used it
by jove as if she were issuing soap
coupons they in turn were blessed
with an heir whose one idea in life ap-
pears to have been to do as mother
had done

  that he was rather successful my
father probably learned when he be-
came the eleventh earl of diddering-
ton

  in spite of- his antecedents my
father was everything worth while-
that is he was a gentleman and a
scholar and even spoke in the plouse
of lords once or twice to prove that
he was also a patriot

  but poor old chap he had no idea
of business and my mother died when
i avas born

  i am the last of the didderingtons
-without a relative in the whole wide
world

  ltpon my fathers death i fell heir

to the title and a lot of legal phrase-
ology explaining why the diddering-
ton estates did not belong to me

  i went through those mortgages
like the six hundred at balaklava -
mortgages to right of me mortgages
to left of me volleying and thunder-
ing interest-notices like grape-shot i
was in a horrible fix

  most of the cannons belonged to a
chap named rollins - theodore d
rollins

  i had never heard of the beggar be-
fore but my lawyers told me he was
an american who appeared anxious
to take up all the mortgages and had
already secured several that had not
originally been held by him

  there were really only two parcels
of the didderington estates he had not
snapped up

  one was a small piece of farmland
which i did not care a rap about and
the other was a hundred square yards
or thereabouts of didderington park
including the lodge at the gates

  the latter was a rather strategetical
piece of property including the prin-
cipal entrance the lodge and the first
hundred yards of the main carriage
drive the owner of it could if he
cared close the whole place up and
force the proprietor of the rest of the
park to go to a jolly lot of expense
building a new road and a new en-
trance for himself

  that mortgage was held by a shrewd
old chap named silas anson who was
not much given to sentiment he did
not care a hang whether the didder-
ingtons were after centuries of resi-
dence there thrown out of diddering-
ton park or not and as i knew per-
fectly well that i could not hold out
for more than two or three years at
most meeting interest-bills only
there wasnt a chance in a thousand
that i would be able to take up the
mortgage on the lodge when it fell
due in march of the coming year

 the amount was ten thousand
pounds

  if i could not find it within six
a thieves comedy



months anson would of course sell
the property to the highest bidder

  rollins

  i could almost feel that beggar
waiting for march to come round and
naturally i was very eager to know
why he was trying to close me out it
isnt very nice to have some one you
dont know buying your place over
your head

  that rollins chap could stand in
the main gateway with a bill of sale in
lieu of a flaming sword and bar me
from the domains of my ancestors as
old timothy dolliver great-grandson
of the original dolliver used to keep
out picnic parties on our  closed 
days

  timothy was the last of the dolli-
ver s to stand guard over our gateway
he had six daughters but no son and
i think the fact preyed upon his mind
toward the end a dolliver had al-
ways been lodgekeeper at diddering-
ton park but as he said himself at
the birth of each daughter

   lasses are nowt-nowt i tell ee-
but for marryin an changin their
names 

  to return to business-my rents
and so forth barely cared for the huge
loans made in times past and when
one attempts to keep up a place like
didderington park and have oneself
live up to it the result is obvious to
any one who can put two and two suc-
cessfully together

  i thought that over it wasnt a bit
difficult to realize that expenses must
be cut in half and cut again and that
i must make money somehow or
other

  but i couldnt think of a single
thing i was stumped completely -
middle wicket

  so i went to the club and told sys-
onsby about it

  sysonsby fagged for me at eton
and he is quite as much of an ass now
as he was then but he is the only chap
i can get to listen to me all the others
are afraid i have got the diddering-
ton habit of borrowing money but as

sysonsby hasnt got any to lend he
doesnt care

  he said quite frankly after i had
explained things to him

   didder youre a chump if i had
your advantages do you suppose id
hang round this club jingling a few
pennies in my pocket

   you seem to forget that youre
an earl-a knight of the strawberry-
leaf with a seat in the house of lords
that you are an idiot does not matter

  if you will read the list of imports
once a month you shall find that sev-
eral million dollars worth of ameri-
can heiress has been brought to our
shores for the purpose of dusting off
musty coronets and renovating deca-
dent ancestral halls of course i
must admit didderington is a devil of
a name to ask any woman to take
but you could at least try it

  i wont repeat verbatim what i said
but i told him id be hanged if i would
i am not that sort of a chap

  sysonsby seemed bottled for a bit--
quite disappointed then all at once
he slapped his knee and when that
beggar slaps his knee one can expect
something almost original

   i have it  he exclaimed so loud-
ly that an old chap napping in a near-
by chair jumped gaped and glared at
sysonsby so that he modulated his
enthusiasm a little

  you have what i asked and
nodded to one of the club waiters to
bring the  usual

   the whole plot and if it isnt
right it ought to be its too good to
be wrong

  wait for the drinks old chap i
may need mine after youve told it
worse than i do now

  oh bosh its quite pretty in its
way theodore d rollins you said
the chaps name was  

  i nodded

   well its quite simple sysonsby
continued with that idiotic assurance
of his  rollins is a millionaire of
course and has a daughter with an
eye upon the peerage


the all-story magazine

   two or three of her chums have
landed coronets and she is simply
aching- to call herself countess of some-
thing or other she is an only daugh-
ter rollins would buy her the moon
if he could-and he has learned about
you looked you up found that you
batted a few centuries for surrey last
year that you can sit on a horse well
enough to play on a second-grade polo
four-that you stand seventy-one and
a half inches in your socks that you
have a passable countenance and are
not such a fool as you look

   one cant have everything so he
has decided to put up with your name
and when he has bought up all the
didderington mortgages he shall come
to you and say  young man i own
the castles and the lands of your an-
cestors all i need to complete the
business is that thing you stick on your
head on state occasions and i guess
ive got to get you to get that i have
a daughter- and the thing is done

  of course to make it novelettish
youve got to meet her somewhere be-
fore the old chap comes on the scene
at all and fall in love with her and she
with you without either of you know-
ing who the other is she must be
ravishingly beautiful and you - well
-you cant be helped rollins is pay-
ing for it so i have no reason to com-
plain

  the waiter came and departed i
drank deeply before i replied and
since there were other club members
in the smoking-room of course i
spoke quietly

  what i said does not really matter
sysonsby laughed at it he has no
respect for a chaps feelings and he
foolishly proposed a wager that rol-
lins was really up to the stupid busi-
ness of buying me as a husband for
his daughter

  i refused it at all events said it was
tommyrot and that in any case i
would not marry the girl if she were
as fascinating as cleopatra and as
rich as the bank of england

  and sysonsby laughed again - a

beastly knowing laugh-as if he had
more grounds for his idiotic theories
than mere imagination

   all right old chap he said sip-
ping his whisky and soda and looking
queerly at me over the top of the glass
 have it your own way but i should
advise you to find out what rollins is
after-if it isnt your coronet

   he evidently means to shut the
gates of didderington park and the
doors of didderington manor in your
face one of these days look him up
old man

   she may not be as fascinating as
cleopatra nor as rich as the bank of
england-but a name like yours must
give some discount im going to get
shaved i believe the randania sails
on saturday

  i said in the beginning that sysons-
by was an idiot and i still thought so
when the following saturday from
the randanias upper promenade-deck
i watched holyhead vanish into thin
blue haze

chapter ii
sysonsbys friend

  every one has been seized with a
few foolish impulses sailing upon
the randania was one of mine but i
was really never more serious in my
life

  somehow or other i could not get
sysonsbys idea out of my head per-
haps you know how it is 

  the germ of a remote possibility
bothers you you laugh at it at first-
not very sincerely - but the thing
sticks and the more you think of it the
bigger and more bothersome it grows
until you admit it quite probable then
you lie awake at night and before
morning you are quite sure there is no
mistake about it

  i spent two quite interesting days
and nights - hardly slept a wink -
thought like the dickens - and rose
upon friday morning very much deter-
mined to leave my bally coronet in the
a thieves comedy



dust-bin until i could pick it out and
clean it myself

  that forenoon i called upon my
lawyers told them to look after my
rents and so forth-to sack everybody
dt didderington park but the house-
keeper a maid and the gardener who
had a wife and a fine little chap they
were foolish enough to give my name
to and further the lawyers were to
give me one thousand pounds - if i
were worth that much

  they said i could have eleven hun-
dred if i wanted all the cash that was
legally mine but i stuck to my plan
and took the thousand determined to
make it ten in six months or go to the
wall

  i disliked that man rollins intense-
ly more particularly since i could
learn nothing of him in london and
i also entertained an antipathy toward
the  heiress daughter  of sysonsbys
story but as one will i thought id
rather like to see whether she was as
ravishingly beautiful as she  novel-
ettishly  ought to be

  that was possibly one reason why
i booked a passage on the randania-
but the other two were much more im-
portant

  i wanted to learn first hand if i
could more of the future owner of
didderington manor and to sink my
identity and my thousand where i be-
lieved the quickest results could be ob-
tained and thought it would be rich if
rollins should own the manor and
most of the park while i held the
lodge and the gate with money id
made right under his nose

  when i booked a berth under the
name of john t mason and glanced
at the passenger- ist i felt that the
earl of didderington had given the
chance of recognition the slip

  yet though there was no one on the
randania with whom i was even dis-
tantly acquainted the majority of the
passengers being americans returning
from summering in europe-i held to
my stateroom pretty religiously bri-
bing a steward to serve all my meals

there- only going up on deck after
dark

  the weather was ideal and usually
for an hour or two after dinner the
decks were quite lively then the crowd
would thin out by twos and threes
careful mamas would trot frivolous
daughters away from light flirtations
in shadowy corners

  the piano in the music-room that
hammered  sugar - moons  and
 junes  and  spoons  out of its sys-
tem for hours on end would give one
last wail in the form of  auld lang
syne or my country tis of
thee - god save the king  i call
it-and join hands with its tormentors
in silence the chatter and the laughter
would die away into the bowels of the
ship and the men left to their own
devices would struggle with desultory
monotoned conversation for a little
while until one by one their  good-
night  cigars would go whirling over-
board and they would descend to their
cabins

  in the smoke-room of course men
sat late idling with chance and their
refreshments till the deck steward re-
spectfully intimated his intention to
put out the lights

  upon the third night out when al-
most every one else had gone to bed
i was strolling up and down the deck
trying to appreciate the moon and the
rather pretty effect upon the water

  some chaps--i dont mean poets-
go into ecstacies over that sort of
thing i cant it probably goes a
little too deep for me-that is i dont
care to say too much about it

  i had the deck to myself though
there were still sounds of hilarity ema-
nating from the smoke-room

  away to starboard i saw what i at
first presumed was a particularly large
and restless star halting and leaning
over the rail i discovered the star to
be the headlight of a tramp or some-
thing of the kind and for a few min-
utes the bobbing light interested me

  i wondered what she carried where
she had come from whither she was


the all-story magazine

bound to suit my fancy she was a
tramp - black and storm-beaten with
a rugged bearded skipper on the
bridge guiding her on her wallowing
course from hamburg to honolulu

  she had anchored in the shadow of
table mountain stuck her nose into
the shifting niger mud became ice-
bound at archangel and run foul of
a pirate junk off hong-kong

  according to my arrangement of
her movements she was plowing
through the treacherous heaving bay
of biscay bound for tangiers

   the earl of didderington is not
a believer in the old adage of early
to bed and early to rise

  the voice was deep and low and
as i turned my head sharply i saw that
the owner of it was quite worthy his
face was not quite distant at first but
there was no mistaking his size

  he was huge - dwarfed me com-
pletely in height breadth and person-
ality one felt the last first and at
once even in the dark-as if one were
standing in a presence and was instant-
ly awed thereby

  i was startled of course never
having seen the man before i was at
a loss to know how he knew my name
and as i tried to peer under the broad-
rimmed felt hat he wore a soft laugh
escaped him

   that is a waste of time he told
me quietly  will you walk or do
you prefer to watch that tramp ped-
dling her way to the scrap-heap its
all the same to me

  the authority in his tone nettled me
for a bit i gasped and stood still
wondering why i did it then i
laughed-as best i could

   youre a queer chap-very inter-
esting no doubt and all that-but you
see i dont know you my name is
mason good night

  i intended to walk away and leave
him there but i didnt a large finger
halted me-just a finger the hand it
belonged to must have resembled a
roast

   i am glad to make your acquaint-

ance mr mason he said calmly
 men who know me little call me
campbell that will do for the pres-
ent others who know me better have
another name for me but it canna be
even whispered here i am your friend
is not that enough are ye a man or
a cateran  

  i stayed and puzzled and looked
blankly up at him with that  canna 
of his sticking in my ears that
word apart from the name he had
given me fixed his nationality

   very well mr campbell ill re-
turn the compliment and say i am glad
to make your acquaintance i decided
at last  lets go and sit down some-
where farther away from the smoke-
room im interested really and if
its anything one-half as mysterious as
you are im selfish enough to want to
keep it all to myself

  without another word he piloted me
into the shadow of a deck-house where
he distributed his huge bulk over a
deck-chair while i lit a cigar-offering
him one which he refused-and sat
down beside him

   i seldom smoke when i want to
talk he told me and added   youre
a canny man-for a didderington
theyve generally been a feckless crew
and when a friend o us both said you
might sail on the randania i thought
id sail wi ye-tae keep ye oot o mis-
chief

  i sat up

   sysonsby 

  campbell nodded and leaning back
in his chair unconsciously gave me a
better view of his face

  it was broad and strong clean-
shaven set with deep blue eyes that
danced sometimes or remained danger-
ously steady at others giving one due
warning of what might happen if one
was not very careful the mouth
opened and closed like a trap and no
one could for a moment mistake the
compelling quality of his voice or un-
derestimate the folly of antagonizing
him

   mr sysonsby is the man  he de-
a thieves comedy



clared quietly in reply to my exclama-
tion  he did me a service once in
paris and we exchanged cards when-
ever i am in london i look him up
this time he told me about you and-
the deuce he did i exclaimed
and wished sysonsby were within
arms length of me

   dinna swear no man ever got
anywhere of consequence by the use o
profane language and theres one of
those smoke-room fools whos been
drinking more than his head can stand
glowerin at us like a sheep

  as i turned my head the  smoke-
room fool  in question lurched across
the deck toward the rail and hung over
it limply i moved with the intention
of helping him to a chair but again
campbell stayed me with a finger

   mind your own business the
mans all right and thats the deck-
stewards work but i like the spirit
o charity in ye thats no a didder-
ington trait sysonsby said ye were a
good sort and mebbe youre no so
saft as ye look

  his great hand suddenly seized my
arm crushing my biceps till i almost
yelped

   uni-it might be worse he ad-
mitted while i looked somewhat blank-
lv at him and felt his proprietary atti-
tude creeping over me

   who-who the dickens are you 
i asked at last desperately  and
what did sysonsby tell you you talk
as if youd known me all my life and
ive never set eyes on you before i
know youre scotch of course-

   and there yere wrang he inter-
rupted softly and continuing his voice
instantly altered without a trace of
scotch in it i am an american of
new york five generations removed
from aberfoyle where my forefathers
were kings of men i was born a
stones throw from fifth avenue and
was educated at harvard

   my fathers name was one to con-
jure with in wall street and mine has
been coupled in rumor with almost
every debutante that has been thrown

upon the four hundreds matrimonial
market since i slipped into my fathers
shoes

   i have been invited to run for a
seat in congress and the mayor of
new york has several times declared
that i was one of the citys most dis-
tinguished citizens

  a chuckle of enjoyment came from
the depths of his great chest

   these are my credentials and ive
given you the name of a friend of us
both-and maybe youve heard of a
man named rollins

  heard of him good heaven-
the man owned me

   yes-yes-do you know the beg-
gar i admitted and asked hurriedly

   theres young van huysen being
carried off to his bed campbell de-
clared with most irritating irrelevancy
referring to the smoke-room fool who
was led toward the companionway by
the deck-steward

   hell be twenty-one next march
and will burn enough money any day of
his life thereafter to keep ten able-
bodied useful humans for a year the
lord didnt mean that to happen when
the world was first thought of 

   no-no-of course not i agreed
at once  but this rollins chap-

   is a nasty man to look to for sym-
pathy campbell interrupted absent-
ly watching the young man vanish
clown the companion  he wastes it
all on that young skate ive been telling
you about-young van huysen is his
nephew you know rollinss daugh-
ter and he are engaged to be married
-next year

  for some unearthly reason i was
disappointed

  campbell looked dreamily out
across the water and for a moment or
two there was silence

   rollins has made money and he
keeps it he continued in a low tone
still looking straight ahead  that
man would not give ten cents to a sal-
vation army christmas dinner but
he will-he will 

  he turned toward me quickly


the all-story magazine

   mark me didderington i say he
will not ten cents either-no-not
ten cents 

   but - what the dickens- i be-
gan blankly and he suddenly leaned
forward and laid his hand on my arm

  you know where you stand he
questioned hurriedly in a low tone
and his voice changed instantly  i
need not remind you of your condi-
tion-and you are going to new york
where a life can be bought for a meal

   youre a nuisance in the eyes of
some people i know but i can offer
you my assistance which better men
than you have accepted before this
and nae doot will accept again i
am a man wha bothers little wi the
law the law is for them that need it
to hide behind and evade their honest
obligations

   if ye tak up wi me i can help ye
and put ye back where your fathers
were but ye must be prepared for
things ye never thought of and to
help me when your turn comes i give
nothing for nothing - not even to a
starving man

   when he is fed and able to stand
and use his hand or his head he must
work and do my bidding and ill
no turn any mans toes doon the
wrang road

   thats my proposal ill helpyou
if youll help me and if yed like to
meet the man rollins be at my club
next thursday at ten in the morning

  he rose very suddenly thrusting a
card into my hand

   but hang it all  i protested
gaping

   ivhccsht  no a word o this
to a soul men who bargain wi me
dont as a rule ask questions i tell
them a i think they ought to ken-
an nae mair

   on this ship we dont know each
other - understand keep to your
night-owl practises thats best for
us all-at present gude nicht mr
mason ill be at the club next thurs-
day at  am sharp

  he turned his huge frame about

and in a moment more was swinging
from my sight down the saloon com-
panion leaving me to stare after him
wondering which of us was the great-
er fool

  then as several of the smoking-
room habitues came on deck i real-
ized that in my isolation i was ma-
king myself conspicuous and imme-
diately descended to my cabin where
switching on the light i glanced at the
card campbell had given me

  it had a curious border of small red
and black squares and upon it was
printed

for charity

chapter hi

the yonkers affair

  before we reached new york i
hanged sysonsby quite frequently for
discussing my affairs with strangers

  but hanging him did not alter mat-
ters a bit and campbells mysterious
manner his apparent knowledge of
rollins his blind proposal and the
scottish dialect he as an american so
curiously affected kept me constantly
deciding and reversing my decision to
accept his offer of assistance

  the chap interested me he was
a new experience and his claim that
he could put me back  where my
fathers had been though bombastic
was at least in keeping with my ideas
what he expected of me in return i
could not fathom

  i looked at the card he had given
me a hundred times a day and it was
not easy to curb my curiosity upon the
several matters that were then of im-
portance but though i went up on
deck every evening hopeful that he
would renew our conversation i
learned no more of him on the ran-
dania
a thieves comedy



  i saw him several times and am
quite sure that he always saw me but
there was nothing in his expression to
suggest it his principal interest ap-
peared to be the entertainment of two
young ladies and a distinguished-look-
ing matron whom i presumed was
their mother

 a young man resembling the
 young van iiuysen  who had been
put to bed by the deck-steward some-
times hovered in the background giv-
ing most of his attention to the young-
er girl who was also the prettier of
the two

  campbell appeared to share himself
equally among them all and though
he was probably upon the sunny side
of thirty-five he acted as a sort of
pater familias with the apparent ap-
proval of the matron who might have
been his sister - or the sister of his
mother she was that sort of woman
with her age so carefully concealed
that one might err twenty years

  i could not study any of them very
well there however nor amid the hor-
rible bustle and excitement on the pier
at new york which the ship news re-
porters tell you about every day and
while i was having a dickens of a
time with a customs officer who must
have suspected that i was not very re-
spectable campbell and the others
vanished in the crush

  when the customs chap had quite
finished ferreting through my baggage
and seemed disappointed that my dec-
laration had been a truthful one i
bought a taxi and drove to a very quiet
middle-class hotel in fifty-fifth street
i say  bought  advisedly as t might
have had a london taxi for a week for
what that chauffeur said the taximeter
charged me for about fifteen minutes

  signing the hotel register as mason
i secured two rooms with a bath and
immediately settled down to the busi-
ness of playing valet to myself and of
making myself comfortable for at least
six months

  of course i know now that i began
all wrong

  i should have forgotten everything
id ever been--sold my  topper  and
my english-made clothes taken a
three-dollar-a-week room somewhere
in the  nineties lived on fifty cents
a day denying myself cigars and other
kindred trifles and i should have
bought up several bootblack stands or
dabbled in margins till my five thousand
dollars had become fifty thousand or
had vanished altogether

  or i should have brought my coro-
net with me taken a suite of rooms at
the most expensive hotel i could find
worn the coronet all day everywhere
and hired myself out to advertise some-
bodys breakfast food or soap at ten
thousand a day expenses paid every
newspaper in the country would have
given tlie thing a column-particularly
if i furnished the story that went
with it

  then i might have-

  but there are innumerable things i
might have done

  instead i practically sat down in a
middle-rate hotel which means noth-
ing of importance to any one waiting
for thursday morning which was four
days away

  campbells offer of assistance had
stifled my initiative-such as it was-
and im afraid i leaned upon him more
than i had any right to do considering
that i knew nothing about the man

   that leaning habit is fatal and it is
so easy to acquire sometimes if one
feels that there is some one handy to
stand the racket one is inclined to
slither away ones time fiddling with
tins and that and arriving nowhere

   in the interval i received several im-
pressions of new york that are hardly
worth bothering about in the light of
what came after

  there was the toast at the hotel
which produced indigestion and imme-
diately explained why the clerk chewed
gum the ragtime that followed me
everywhere the dizzy height of the
sky-scrapers the  dont care a hang 
attitude of the lift-boys the glare of
broadway at night and a mardi gras


the all-story magazine

crush at coney island into which i
was brutally inveigled by a traveling
salesman whom i met at the hotel and
whom i lost together with my hat my
hearing and my dignity somewhere
amid the confetti and the noise and the
seething mob on surf avenue

  i never saw the salesman again

  there was also a colonel from one
of the carolinas who helped me to-
ward an understanding of the why and
wherefore of the souths defeat that
i went to sleep in the middle of it did
not matter he woke me up and began
all over again

  however thursday morning came
at last and i remember whistling the
 british grenadiers  while i tubbed

  the waiter at breakfast eyed me sus-
piciously because i smiled and did not
ask him to take back the toast

  but a head-line on the front page of
my morning paper and the news-matter
that filled half the column below it re-
moved my cheerfulness slowly it read 
rob roy gang pays another call

card left with j f berman of yonkers

 in cash and jewels gone no explosives or drills
used to open safe yonkers police fail
to find trace of thieves

  it appeared that mr bermans house
had been entered the previous evening
and the safe containing money and
most of the family jewels had been
opened and ransacked

  in the card-tray in the hall there was
found a card with a border of red and
black squares bearing the words

for charity

  for a little while i stared at the type
with my mouth open and at first i
think i barely understood just what it
meant

   campbell a-

  i didnt say it-hardly dared to
think it

  it seemed too ridiculous to be given
a second thought yet i gave it a third
and a fourth and a fifth and became
more and more uncomfortable

  the newspaper expressed small
sympathy for mr berman and i
thought the account of the matter was
written in a rather facetious vein
vaguely suggesting between the lines
that the loss sustained by the burglar-
ized and apparently very frantic gentle-
man represented about all he had ever
subscribed- for charity

  quite evidently too the rob roy
gang was a clever and renowned ag-
gregation their depredations had
created amusement for the masses
roused the anger of their victims and
demanded the respect of the police-
the latter seeming to be unable to solve
the mystery of the gangs existence and
organization and identity

  with something akin to awe and
feeling sure that every one was watch-
ing me i left the breakfast-table
sneaked up to my room and finding
the card campbell had given me tore it
up into very small pieces and burned
them in an ash-tray

  then i breathed more freely and
looked forward tomeeting campbell
with an entirely new interest for the
world i would not have missed my ap-
pointment with this american  five
generations removed from aberfoyle
where his forefathers had been  kings
of men

  might it be that he was a descendant
of the robber-chief tain of the mac-
gregors made famous by sir walter
scott his build and his truly strange
use of the scottish tongue lent color to
the surmise hinting at the same time
that he might be somewhat of a fanatic
about his ancestors

  my anxiety to become acquainted
with rollins was shoved into the back-
ground and as i went out i was so keen
to talk to some one about it that i said
to the clerk as i handed him my key
a thieves comedy



   that rob roy gang is quite an in-
teresting company of thieves  

  the clerk smiled in a superior man-
ner hung my key upon the proper hook
and coming back to me declared in
admiration

   theyre the slickest bunch in new
york when they get goin youll find
them workin westchester to-night
montclair to-morrow and fifth ave-
nue the week after that any gezink
theyve got their mark on might as well
cough up and save trouble

  jove do you know how they
came to acquire their name 

   sure some newspaperman fig-
ured out that the red and black squares
on the cards they leave behind when
they clean out a guy was the rob roy
tartan - you know - the stuff the
scotchies make kilts outa

    i see

  and i imagined as i left the hotel
to keep my appointment at campbells
club that the police of new york
would have paid handsomely for my
vision

chapter iv

rollins

  i havu purposely refrained from
giving the name of the club in which
i met campbell that morning it is
very select--a sort of american edi-
tion of the marlborough minus the
awful silence that hangs over the latter
with a perpetual funereal effect mem-
bership in it constitutes the last word
upon the question of a mans right to
be acknowledged as being perfectly re-
spectable financially socially and
morally

  campbell had breakfasted there he
came out of the dining-room as i en-
tered the reception-hall and the cu-
cumber cant be compared with him
it is cool in a chilly way whereas
campbells calm wasnt in the least ob-
vious it was so complete so natural
and easy one did not notice it at all

  the sight of him made it still more

difficult to believe what i suspected it
was incongruous inexplicable and i
was sure i should wake up presently

  but even his generous crop of dark
red hair seemed to substantiate the evi-
dence  had against him all he need-
ed i thought was a beard of a similar
hue the picture of scotts hero and
the cattle-thief ancestor he claimed for
his own would then be complete

  his height and breadth seemed to
lose some of their hugeness in the day-
light but he was still massive and
though his mouth and eyes and jaw all
gave evidence of power of another
order there was a wealth of sympathy
and fellowship in his face

  he greeted me with a smile and a
 good morning  that came rumbling
from the depths of him and his hand-
shake was something to remember

  it was i who was embarrassed and
afraid as we met and i who quaked
as we entered the smoking-room and
walked across the floor in the teeth of
the few members in the room at that
hour but it was instantly apparent
that my companion was a man of
worth in clubdom almost every one
in the place greeted him with the easy
familiarity of old friends and the
studied  good morning sir of men
just sufficiently acquainted to be con-
scious of one anothers wrorth

  as we passed a white - haired old
gentleman he put his paper down and
looked over the top of his glasses at
campbell who saluted him sonorously

   good morning judge

   good morning robert have you
a minute  

  asking my pardon and indicating
where we would sit campbell talked to
the judge for a little while and i
watched him pondering the irony of it

  he appeared to be in a very good
humor that morning and though when
he rejoined me he talked of nothing in
particular i listened very attentively in
spite of the hundred and one things
crowding upon my mind and of
course i could hardly throw the rob
roy gang at his head in his own club


the all-story magazine

  still rattling on in the same key
which was not loud enough to be heard
by any one else and with no hint of
the scotch accent he said lightly 

    judge farquhar claims it will be
two months to-morrow since i dined
with him his wife is a motherly soul
and adds an inch to my stature every
time i call so you see i really am
quite respectable--up here rollins is
just five minutes late as usual

  his glance went idly past me toward
the door and sharply turning my
head i saw a lean-faced clean-shaven
man of medium height standing in the
doorway looking swiftly about him
and nodding to several of the men
who rather bruskly i thought took
note of his arrival

  as his eyes lighted upon campbell
and me he came toward us with short
snappy steps and an apology forming-
on his tongue campbell rose and i
followed suit feeling a little chilly

  rollins is the only reason i can give
for the sensation

  instantly i knew that he was small
and probably mean some men have
their character written upon them so
plainly one cant make a mistake

  yet rollinss face was not a bad one
the lines were good there was some-
thing of aristocracy in it-the aquiline
nose and the broad forehead the eyes
and mouth however were a different
combination-the latter was weak-
the sort that lies easily the former
shifty with a hint of cruelty

  he was sparely built and wore his
clothes without ostentation - every-
thing but his tie it was a hideous
thing out of all harmony with the rest
of him and the only solution i have to
offer for a man of his station wearing
such atrocities is-that he must have
been color-blind and -would not admit
it to his valet

  his hair was tinged with gray and
there was a small round bald spot on
the top of his head but his carefully
preserved countenance did not say that
he was as i learned later within an
ace of half a century

   at once without any hesitation i
 disliked him apart from the fact that
 i hated to think of him owning did-
 derington and was quite sure then and
 there that i was not going to like his
 daughter any better-if ever we were
 introduced

    sorry if ive kept you waiting
 he began hurriedly and i did not like
 the way his eyes skipped from place to
 place as if he were afraid to look
 straight at me

   i noted that campbell and he did not
 shake hands and for a moment or two
 as i did not know how i was to be
 introduced i felt horribly uncertain of
 s where i stood

    mr mason permit me to intro-
duce you to mr rollins the most con-
firmed american-englishman in the
states

   there was little humor in campbells
 deep tones but i smiled and murmured
 the usual lie about being very glad and
 so forth i felt the pressure of rol-
 linss long bony fingers about my own

   sometimes lying awake at night i
 feel that handshake and shiver

   we sat down again and when camp-
 bell had ordered drinks we talked-or
 at least campbell did--and i learned
 before i had a chance to say anything
 on the matter that i was a close friend
 of a man named sysonsby who had
 done him a service of some sort in
 paris and apparently he had prom-
 ised sysonsby to make my short stay
 of a few weeks in new york as inter-
 esting as possible

   all that--with no hesitancy what-
 ever

   rollins accepted the explanation
 without a question and if i showed the
 effect of the prevarication in my face
 it did not seem to matter

    unfortunately as i was just saying
 before mr rollins came in campbell
 continued seeming very apologetic
 and curiously enough ignoring rollins
 altogether  i will require to go out of
 town a great deal in the next few
 weeks but mr rollins -bowing to-
 ward that gentleman yet looking past
a thieves comedy



hint- who really knows how to en-
tertain an englishman -bowing to-
ward me and smiling- very kindly
offered yesterday afternoon when i
told him of my plight to give you a
less lazy impression of new york than
i would

   really that is-er-awfully good
of you but- i stammeringly began in
protest

   no no no-not at all rollins in-
terrupted in that suave quick way he
had  mr campbells friends are
mine and to prove it we shall all take
dinner at mrs van huysens this eve-
ning where you shall meet the whole
family and be made thoroughly at home
before campbell leaves town mrs
van huysen is my sister you know
and since my wife died my daughter
and i like poor relations almost live
there

  he laughed and i tried to-campbell
refused to bother lying about his sen-
sations but he seemed to be waiting
for my reply

  i could not think of an excuse quick-
ly enough and then being reminded
of the opportunity to meet sysonsbys
 novelettishly beautiful  heroine i
thought i might as well see her

   thanks i shall be very glad

  campbell rose so abruptly that i was
startled

   now-if you will pardon me rush-
ing off like this i am sure i can leave
you feeling certain that mr rollins
will take good care of you i have an
appointment down-town at eleven and
must hurry but i shall see you again
this evening

  while i struggled to say something
appropriate he had seized my hand and
was goneswith just a nod for rollins
who sat still and said 

   all right old man-ill look after
him

  the whole thing happened so quickly
i didnt have time to form an opinion
but i watched with mixed sensations
the big mans red-topped head go out
of the door while rollins who did not
seem to mind the fact that i was not

listening to him instantly began to talk
of a naval review he had seen at spit-
head

  that was only the beginning he
talked of the  green of devon of
 british brawn of englands wars
of her colonies of everything english
under the sun

  the chap was england-mad he
even grew sentimental about it and
when an american becomes wishy-
washy about england he is not to be
trusted

  it did not seem to bother him in the
least that i paid little or no attention to
what he said but then he did not look
straight at me for two consecutive sec-
onds in the two hours we sat there nor
while at lunch which i ate at his ex-
pense

  i was too busy trying to imagine
where campbell was leading me to and
as i watched rollins fiddle with the
cheese while he talked of henley re-
gatta i tried to picture him putting me
out of didderington manor - and
couldnt

  the picture would not form

  he said as he signed the card that
he would show me new york as he
knew it-but i was almost sure to be
disappointed

   why even our slums havent ex-
isted long enough to be interesting
they have no history and who wants
to bother with filth alone but well
go down to chinatown some evening
and then possibly to a place i know in
a supposedly dangerous section called
 hells kitchen

   the name is much more lurid than
the district lots of people say its
worse than whitechapel-but thats
rubbish at any rate you shall see it
for yourself and draw your own con-
clusions

  i looked across the table at him and
found his eyes elsewhere

  yet t said i should be glad to and
on the way to my hotel tried to explain
why i had been so foolish and why
rollins had seemed so pleased

  knowing what i did of whitechapel


the all-story magazine

he was among the last men in the world
with whom i should venture into any-
thing resembling it

chapter v

a disappointing evening

  the van huysen residence was on

-th street a few doors east of

fifth avenue-which is to say that it
was among the elite of new yorks
private dwellings

  it was not a pretentious-looking
place and its interior leaned more to-
ward the cozy than the esthetic

  i cant describe house-furnishings
when i enter a room i take the fur-
niture for granted sometimes if ive
been there more than once i learn that
a particular chair is more comfortable
than the others but i do not mentally
catalogue the hangings and bric-a-brac
or make any fine distinctions between
the heppelwhite sheraton or modern
designs in the tables and chairs and the
rest of the usual things with which
people fill their houses

  the moment i entered the van huy-
sen establishment i was conscious of a
homelike warmth for one thing i was
not confronted with the rather preva-
lent westminster abbey poets corner
effect in the hall-the only evidence of
hero-worship being a bust of goethe
upon a pedestal in an out-of-the-way
corner made by the curve of the stair-
case where the dead-white of the great
teutons parian marble countenance
was subdued by shadows

  even the bronze female figure
crouching in the center of a circular
fountain spray looked comfortable and
the english butler with his nationality
written clearly upon him made me feel
still more at home-that is-for a
second

  then he walked a step or two and-
limped

  evey one will admit that a limping
butler is a novelty that fellows right
heel appeared to trail behind after the
rest of him had gone on and all

through dinner i tried to remember
where the deuce i had seen a butler
limp just like that before

  it wasnt a bit of use i could not
place the chap at all but i had a dis-
agreeable suspicion that he had recog-
nized me

  plis face did not indicate that he had
but that was the sort of butler he was

i imagined he would report the arrival
of the millennium in the same dead
tones in which he announced  mr
mason

  lie spoiled my dinner and the rol-
lins-van huysen families unconscious-
ly assisted him with rollins added
they were the group i had seen on the
randania

  mrs van huysen was a charming
woman and her daughter alice was a
reproduction of the mother-almost
line for line gesture for gesture

  the girls gray eyes held the same
quiet purposeful expression in them
with the same hint of humor lurking
behind it and the mouth and chin
showed the same quality of determina-
tion without appearing in the least
hard or unsympathetic

  her brother ralph was her an-
tithesis being neither quiet nor pur-
poseful nor humorous his mouth and
chin were weak like rollinss and his
eyes had a silly sort of habit of travel-
ing ceilingward while he talked

  slightly under seventy inches i
judged by his flabby anemic appear-
ance that he did not care much for
athletics

  campbell told me afterward that he
had been  sent down  from harvard
for something or other which wasnt
made public i felt sorry for him-at
the same time i thought i would rather
enjoy taking himnto the  gym  and
hammering a little life into him

  but miss rollins-and here you are
possibly going to be disappointed-was
still more lifeless

  i think i have previously said that
she was prettier than her cousin alice
-but im afraid i cant describe her
as she appeared to me that night with-
a thieves comedy	

out referring to her lack-luster expres-
sion as if she had not a particle of
interest in life but the wearing of pretty
clothes and the preserving of a truly
wonderful complexion

  her dull gold hair arranged in a
carefully careless fashion detracted
nothing from the girlishness of her
small oval face the eyebrows were
several shades darker than the hair and
her eyes so deep a brown as to be al-
most black would have been most at-
tractive and appealing if they had not
been so devoid of activity

  but there was an indefinable some-
thing in them at times that made me
wonder if the lackadaisical attitude was
not a clever affectation i imagined
that miss margaret rollins would have
given several years of her young life
to get up from that table and run-
anywhere away from it

  she made only a pretense of eating
and when i caught her looking at me
through some flowers that obscured a
perfect view i had an impression that
for some reason or other she was
weighing me in the balance and was
fearful of being detected in it not by
me so much as by some of the others

  not once did she speak all the while
we sat at table

  it was rather a nervous affair for
me and im afraid i was stupid in
some of my remarks but campbell car-
ried the burden of protecting me from
danger-line subjects such as the trip
over and the people my hostess thought
we both might know and rollins
peculiarly enough seemed anxious to
assist him

  campbell laughed the voyage away
with a joke at my expense he ad-
mitted that i had been on board the
randania and that he had known of it
but i was such a wretched sailor i
hadnt left my cabin and had begged
to be excused from meeting any one
until id got ashore

  appearing not to take any heed of
miss rollinss rather sneaking scrutiny
but to listen very attentively to some-
thing her father was saying about being

disturbed on board ship only when the
screw got out of the water i had a
peculiar notion that his daughter did
not believe campbells story about me

  i could not understand that girl one
moment she was bright with even a sug-
gestion of deviltry and shrewdness
hiding behind the screen her doll-like
beauty made then she would cast a
sidelong questioning glance toward her
father as if she were afraid he might
be watching her and the mask of-
lethargic indifference would fall again

  campbells personality of course
dominated the whole table but i could
not help thinking that alice was just a
little too transparent in her efforts to
avoid such remarks as he directed
to her

  i had a strange jumble of impres-
sions that night and later when we
joined the ladies in the drawing-room
i received a few more

  rollins and i - because rollins
seemed afraid to leave me for a moment
-entertained  mrs van huysen
with a list of places which he thought
would be of interest to an englishman

  out of the corner of my eye i
watched ralph inveigle his cousin-
and fiancee-out of the room to where
i surmised the conservatory ought
to be

  upon a settee just far enough dis-
tant to prevent what they said being
heard campbell and alice also con-
versed in low tones and judging by
the girls attitude i felt that their con-
versation would make interesting read-
ing

  she was leaning away from him as
if she -were not very anxious to hear
what he was saying and because
she had to listen tried to assume an
air of careless unconcern not altogether
successful since i whose perspicacity
isnt anything to make a fuss about
could see that she was not finding
campbells remarks very pleasant

  just as i threatened to become rude
in my lack of attention to her mother
alice rose abruptly and came to-
ward us


the all-story magazine

  campbell did not follow her get-
ting leisurely upon his feet and walking
toward the portiered entrance of an-
other room he announced basso pro-
fundo so that we all turned our heads

   i am going to have some music to
soothe my savage soul when the pain
becomes too intense let me know

  parting and throwing back the hang-
ings revealing the music-room bathed
in subdued light campbell twirled the
seat of the stool before a grand piano
low enough to suit him and instantly
roused the instrument into the activity
of a popular waltz

  mrs van huysen smiled in motherly
approval glanced questipningly up into
her daughters face and-as i did-
found it a little pale

  rollins was saying something or
other about the opera but i did not
hear it very clearly i was trying to do
too many things at once-to be atten-
tive to my hostess to explain the tight-
ening of alices lips and the manner in
which she avoided her mothers silent
interrogation-and to realize that the
man at the piano the respected club-
member and the much-admired much-
at-home representative of a great citys
most select circle was connected in
some way with the active management
of a clever and notorious company of
thieves

  it was truly unbelievable

  then he sang he had a remarkable
voice and unlike most amateurs knew
how to use it

  but alice did not seem to care for it
very much murmuring an apology
she left the room just as ralph and
margaret came trailing in again to
clump down upon the settee campbell
and alice had vacated and for the re-
mainder of the evening the  children 
showed little signs of animation

  altogether they were a curious group
of people

  had i been actually in search of
romance which of course i wasnt
that somewhat aimless evening would
surely have suggested to me the ad-
visability of looking elsewhere or of

taking the first steamer home again
particularly in view of the fact that
the lady in sysonsbys  novel  did
not come up to the specifications

  she was  ravishingly beautiful
enough-no doubt about that-but i
left the house feeling that i had been
imposed upon all around

  i declined rollinss offer to drive
me to my hotel saying i would rather
walk since the night was so fine

  campbell went off in a hurry-to
catch a train for somewhere so i
set out alone digging my hands into
my overcoat-pockets trying to gage
the extent of my disappointment and
the importance of the limping butler

  and my right hand got hold of a
letter-a letter that hadnt been there
when i went to the van huysens

  i pulled the thing out under the
light of the first lamp-post and read
the superscription upon a fairly good
business envelope

   this is it

to the earl of didderington

new york

chapter vi

at grants tpmb

  i knew it was from the butler

  my first thought was that he had
not dallied in letting me know that i
was  discovered  and then i felt
rather indignant with him for his
confounded impertinence in taking lib-
erties with my coat-pockets

  i	did not open the letter however
until i reached my rooms but i did
not saunter as i had intended per-
spiring uncomfortably and with the
door of my sitting-room carefully
locked i glanced at the superscription
again slit the envelope and pulling
forth a half sheet of cream - colored
note-paper read

  at grants tomb saturday night at

  nine taxi dont fail

  that was all-not even an initial
attached to it the writing firm and
a thieves comedy



bold was unquestionably masculine
but the construction of the invitation
struck me as being somewhat peculiar
-for a butler either the gentleman
with the limp was an impudent beg-
gar or i was guessing wrong

  i lay awake most of the night puz-
zling over the matter and it is suffi-
cient to say that i arrived nowhere-
not even in a continued effort to re-
member where i had seen the butler
before

  the mans face was not at all fa-
miliar-just his rather odd limp i
awoke next morning still in the dark
about him and in a wretched humor

  there was no music in my soul
while i tubbed that morning

  sysonsbys dream had gone to the
dickens campbell was too uncertain
a quantity to rely upon and his pe-
culiar action in tying me to rollinss
coat-tails irritated me i detested
mystery

  the police according to that morn-
ings paper were quite at sea regard-
ing the berman robbery and new
york was told by yonkers to keep its
gangsters to itself some people
wrote letters about it indignant amu-
sing critical but they didnt teach
me anything

  rollins was to call for me in his car
at ten and i would have enjoyed
sending down word that i was not at
home had it not been for the fact that
i had nothing better to do and thought
i might as well suffer him for a day
or two just to see if anything worth
while would happen

  his intention for that morning was
to have me compare the metropolitan
museum with the national gallery

  i did not know whether we had any-
thing resembling grants tomb or
not but as i dressed i made up my
mind that our itinerary for that day
should embrace it to me at that
stage of my acquaintance with new
york a tomb sounded rather funereal
as a rendezvous and i thought i
would like to look it and its surround-
ings over in the daylight before i

    	s

should decide whether or not to ac-
cept the anonymous invitation

  when rollins called i thought he
was disgustingly pleasant he
gushed and a woman who does that
is bad enough i insinuated that i
would like to see grants tomb and
he declared at once that my sugges-
tion was splendid and added

   riverside drive has been com-
pared favorably by a few as being the
equal of if not an improvement upon
the embankment but  - with a
smile that pitied the critics referred
to- of course we know better just
as we know that cricket is a much
more gentlemanly game than base-
ball

  i did not know anything about it
then - baseball i mean-and i have
always been very fond of cricket so i
did not argue the point

  i had the good fortune however to
see a worlds series game last year
and jove it was a scorcher in the
seventh inning the-but i mustnt do
that sort of thing i am not a base-
ball reporter and since you can read
a guide-book of new york anywhere
at any time you will please take the
metropolitan museum of art et
cctcra ct cetcra for granted

  rojlins clung to me like a leech
hustling me about for all the world
like a cooks tourist till i had given
up hope of being able to get rid of
him so that i might have a chance to
satisfy myself upon the authorship of
the mysterious note

  about six-thirty on saturday eve-
ning seated in his car we were cross-
ing the east river in a ferryboat to
thirty-fourth street on our return
from some aviation trials at mineola
long island

  rollins had lapsed into silence and
as i was considering how i could tell
him that i should like very much to
be alone that evening he surprised me
by becoming suddenly apologetic-be-
cause he found it impossible to dine
with me

   i got a telegram this morning


the all-story magazine

he explained  from a very old busi-
ness friend of mine we became-
members of the stock exchange about
the same time and many of our in-
terests have been affiliated ever since
he is coming in from the west to-
night-probably is at his hotel now
and though ive been trying to think
up an excuse all day im afraid i
cant get out of it im awfully
sorry-

  oh thats all right i assured
him  no doubt ill manage to
amuse myself in some way

  so we both laughed and lied our
way to freedom from each other for
one evening rollins evidently as se-
cretly anxious as i the  old friend
from the west  story sounded so
very much like the  friend just home
from india that i was extremely
skeptical about it but i was not satis-
fied that everything was to be all right
until he dropped me at my hotel and
left me there

  then i felt at liberty to turn my
thoughts without restraint toward
grants tomb

  i would have liked very much to
have been able to discuss the thing
with campbell and was not at all sure
when i started out at quarter past
eight that i would actually meet the
butler the fellow was not so dread-
fully important so far as i could see
but of course i wanted to be on the
spot to confirm my surmise that he
had really written the note

  grants tomb as every american
knows is situated upon the loftiest
rise of riverside park overlooking the
hudson river sightseeing cars or a
fifth avenue bus will take you there
and you will find that the magnificent
resting-place for a magnificent man
occupies the center of a generous
space and possibly your bus may not
go any farther but will sweep round
the broad driveway encircling the
tomb and go off down-town again

  the taxi referred to dn the note
would necessarily require to do the
same thing that is approach the tomb

from down-town upon the driveway
on the right and make the circle to re-
turn

  there is a constant stream of cars
passing to and fro and not a little pe-
destrian traffic if the evening is fine
the flare of electric lamps lights up
the main drive but beyond it there is
plenty of shadow and the seats strung
along the sidewalk close to the park
rail are usually occupied-two people
upon each seat

  the hudson lapping the foot of
the parks gentle slope and dotted
with the bobbing lights of miscel-
laneous craft rolls on in broad maj-
esty to the sea across the water the
jersey shore winks at fitful distances
and as i waited watching for a taxi
that would show signs of having the
tomb for its destination the search-
light from an albany boat swept over
the scene in a ghostly fashion

  several of the people occupying
seats in the shadows were startled into
more decorous attitudes and i caught
sight of a taxi that had just trundled
past break from the common stream
and turn to encircle the rendezvous

  i made no effort at concealment
and i had decided on the run up-
town not to be bothered with any in-
solence or hints of blackmail or any-
thing in fact but an explanation as to
where i had seen that limp before
then i would send the chap home
with a little advice upon the value of
silence which he would preserve un-
less he wished to have his head
punched

  thus i was mentally and physically
quite prepared for him when the taxi
with other eyes than mine upon it
drew into the curb

  approaching it without hesitation i
stood waiting for the butler to get out

  he did not get out nor did the
chauffeur leave his seat

  i began to think i had made a mis-
take and some audible though not in-
telligible comment from the seats be-
hind me hinted that i was making an
ass of myself
a thieves comedy



  but i took a step nearer to make
sure and as i did so the occupant of
the taxi leaned forward

  margaret rollins

chapter vii

arranging things

  a movement of her hand beckoned
me to get into the taxi and to be quick
about it

  it was no time or place for argu-
ment

  i obeyed

  the girl was alone not in the least
frightened or apologetic and while i
was vainly searching for something
to say she remarked as the cab moved
out from the curb

   before we let the taximeter regis-
ter any more miles against us perhaps
id better be sure that you have enough
money to pay for it 

  it is useless to attempt to explain
how i felt i was too limp and sur-
prised to finely analyze sensations

  the miss rollins i had met a few
evenings before had departed com-
pletely by my side-too near me in
fact to be quite fair to any man-sat
a new creation

  she was beautiful and vivacious
and entirely self-possessed her eyes
sparkled with the joy of life and free-
dom and i knew that she was laugh-
ing at me quietly within

   you see she explained  i didnt
have time to bother about money
when i fainted at aunt alices-

   fainted 

  yes i faint beautifully and
cousin alice was sent home with me
in their car papa has an apartment
on central park west not far from
mr campbell of course you know
that papa is not at home to-night dont
you  

   er-yes-i believe he said some-
thing about getting a telegram from a
friend this morning-

  a peculiarly bright smile interrupt-
ed me

   papa isnt always truthful he
fibs outrageously sometimes he had
a visit from that friend on monday
and thats one reason why im here
shocking you so very much please
dont lets waste time discussing how
unconventional this is im tired of
conventional things anyway you
look as if you were afraid of me

   was but i sat up a little straighter
and tried to refute the charge

  no - im just a bit startled it
isnt right you know and you are so

-	er - so different altogether dif-
erent on thursday you looked per-
fectly harmless how did you pene-
trate my disguise  

  she shook her head slowly

   cant answer

   any other member of the family
group guessed it

   alice she put that letter in your
coat-pocket and helped me to faint and
get away from her mother after
that the rest was easy except that i
havent any money

  she seemed to doubt very much if
i would have enough

   i think i can manage that i an-
swered her  now lets have the ex-
planation

   yes lets she agreed and stopped
there expectantly

  well-er-that is-what is it
i stammered when the pause was be-
coming awkward

   isnt that rather your affair than
mine  

   my-my affair 

  i met the quiet interrogative look
she gave me blankly

   why-yes i have seen and ap-
prove of you and i know youre not
one-half as stupid as you are trying to
appear so please get the proposal
over and done with and then well talk
business dont get down on your
knees though the floors dirty

  we were still somewhere on river-
side drive but mentally i was in pitch-
darkness gasping for air

   pro-posal 

  she laughed at me openly now


the all-story magazine

   dont be frightened there is
nothing very dreadful in asking me to
marry you is there i dont bite or
scratch and i wont say no and if we
dont live happily ever after it will be
your fault now-go ahead

  the fog cleared suddenly and i
joined her in her laughter

   oh yes of course i forgot i
came over here to be romantic i
didnt think the story was common
property though but anyway whats
the use cousin ralph-

   doesnt count the girl interrupt-
ed almost sharply  we wont dis-
cuss him at all please if he were
worth discussion i wouldnt be here
asking you to propose to- me

   you neednt say you love me or
anything like that just ask me if i
will marry you and ill say  yes --
and then well talk about papa and his
friend

   i-i see but-im afraid i-er
-dont catch your point of view this
is so sudden as it were and as ive
never proposed to any one in my life
before i-

  her fingers suddenly gripped my
coat-sleeve

   you havent 

  there was a sort of hungry eager-
ness in her eyes and voice

   not once what does a chap say
as a rule  

  her scrutiny became much keener
and she seemed afraid that she would
find in my face the hint of a lie

   then-will you-please-marry
me 

  it was barely a whisper a soft
flush spread over her cheeks but her
eyes did not waver i felt rather
queer as if we had gone deeper than
was intended and for a moment or
two i just looked steadily down at her
wondering how seriously i was sup-
posed to take her

   is that by way of instruction or-

   will you 

  her fingers slid from my sleeve to
my hand and the grip of them was not
to be ridiculed

    let me say it  i suggested slow-
ly and her expression instantly be-
came less strained  do you want-
to marry me 

    yes

   why 

  because if i dont marry you ill
have to marry ralph - and i prefer
you

   um-i see and cant you refuse
to marry ralph 

   papa wont let me refuse he ar-
ranged my marriage five or six years
ago and has never given me a chance
to talk to any other man he fright-
ens me sometimes with the things he
says and i know ill never be able to
defy him properly unless i marry some
one who isnt afraid of him youre
not afraid of him are you 

  no - i dont think so but are
you sure there isnt some one else you
know better than you do me - some
one you possibly - er - like better 
 marriage is a very serious business

   i know it is thats why i dont
want to marry ralph

    have you told him so  

   often-but he wont believe me
you see he thinks he loves me and
hes a selfish little beast-

   good heavens 

   yes-i mean it he only thinks
of me between the splurges he takes
im his cousin and its on the cards
that im going to marry him so he
doesnt have to bother about being a
gentleman thats his attitude-and
ill have to go through with the horri-
ble thing next june if some one doesnt
run away with me in the interval

    its useless to say no to papa and
its worse than useless to run away
alone hed only find me and bring
me back again-and-and torture me
a little more

    torture you  

   no - i didnt mean that please
dont be inquisitive im just afraid
of him thats all ive tried to- fight
him but i cant and i know that the
only way out is to marry some one-
else
a thieves comedy



   we-i mean-i knew you were
coming over to see if-if i were-nice
enough-to marry and when i saw
what a vast improvement you avere
upon ralph i thought perhaps-well-
youre to be here such a short time and
-and i was afraid-

  she stopped and put it another way
 do you think im marriageable 
that was pointblank enough i was
becoming rather chary too about
meeting her eyes and i hadnt the
courage to tell her that her information
about the length and the purpose of my
visit to america was all wrong

  yes -i must confess you are -
marriageable i admitted honestly
enough  but - er - that is - does
cousin alice know about all this

   she knows my intentions but she
doesnt approve of my methods
theyre all my own and im not go-
ing to make any apologies for them
cant you see how desperate i am  
yes a little but you dont know
anything about me you may just get
out of the frying-pan into the fire i
may have a beastly temper-

   cant be any worse than papas
she interrupted with conviction and
i wouldnt be afraid of you

   no i dont think you would but
you might get awfully tired of seeing
me about the place and-

   not nearly so tired as i am of
ralph already and were not married
yet please dont make excuses you
couldnt make me half so miserable as
i am now if you tried ever so hard-
and-and- would it be so awfully
difficult to-like me 

  i cleared my throat and looked out
of the taxi window we were still on
the drive

   does his nibs know where to go  
i asked turning to face the music
again

  yes - he knows and were not
nearly there yet i believe you want
to run away do you 

   no-no-nothing of the sort i
protested  im enjoying myself im-
mensely you said that after i had

proposed and you had accepted me we
could talk business hadnt we better
talk business first  i mean-my busi-
ness

    it is quite proper you know in ar-
rangements of this sort for the penni-
less earl to declare just how penniless
he is and im afraid i couldnt afford
to support a wife youd be tied for
life to a chap whose earning power
per week would probably be less than
this taxi will cost

   a queer smile parted her lips she
looked beyond me and her immediate
surroundings and seemed to contem-
plate something that gave her an un-
holy joy

   yes-and papa would be terribly
angry too if i married you i think
thats why-i want to

  that made me gasp and stare and
-before i had time to draw breath she
asked simply

   did you ever hear of-bob dol-
liver  

   wh-what- i stopped and re-
garded her for fully a minute in the
blankest sort of amazement but she
avas looking dreamily out of the cab-
avindoav not paying the slightest at-
tention to me

   never mind iioav i know she
avent on still looking past me  he
ran off avith lady alice didderington
and very little more than this taxi will
cost he avas only a lodgekeepers
son you are an earl - educated at
eton and cambridge-i knoav because
i looked you up-and ill have a quar-
ter of a million of my own-

    which doesnt interest me i in-
terrupted probably more sharply than
i intended  wont you tell me how
you came to knoav anything about
lady-

    no cant ansaver any questions
- but one and you havent asked
that yet

   i laughed in spite of my chagrin

    well the point is i cant support
a avife and i havent the least inten-
tion of having a avife support me i
came over here-and i might as well


the all-story magazine

be frank with you - with five thou-
sand dollars in the hope that i could
make it fifty thousand inside of six
months but i suppose im an ass i
havent the faintest idea of where to
begin and ive wasted one precious
week already bothering with-

  i stopped finding two brown eyes
widely attentive with a look in them
suggesting that their owner did not
believe her ears

  you-you have-five thousand
in ready cash  

   well - say --- forty-five hundred
now why

   wait i want to think a minute
its too splendid for anything and
she thought a second or two if i
tell you how you can turn that money
into-oh-ever and ever so much more
-will you-

  her fingers closed about my own
again almost fiercely i couldnt laugh
she was so terribly serious about it

   thats bribery i told her and
wondered why my voice was so quiet

  well cant you like me i think
i want you to very much youre so
different from ralph and-and lots ot
others ive seen and i thought it would
be splendid if you and i could make
a lot of money together right under
papas nose and run off with it-like
bob dolliver and lady alice

  somehow i got hold of her other
hand i dont know just how it hap-
pened  but there we sat holding hands
and looking at each other coming to
an eye - to - eye understanding about
things while the lights upon either
side of us went jogging past that
chauffeur knew his business

  then margaret smiled and the silent
spell was broken

   i am not a marrying man i said
 rubbish i think youd be very
very good to anybody you liked

   thank you and you are really
willing to take the awful chance 
yes no bones about that mon-
osyllable

   all right ill tell you what well
do

   yes

  i think she came a little nearer

to me

   i am to be here at least six months
if at the end of that time ive made
any money and you still feel inclined
to faint well enough to get away from
wherever you are so as to be able to
meet me at grants tomb in a taxi
without any money-well purchase a
license and hunt up a minister hows
that 

   we dont need a license in new
york state--just the minister she
advised thoughtfully and such was
the case at the time

   october november december
january february march she re-
peated loosening her grip upon my
hand to count the months off on her
fingers  um-no-i dont care for
march much lets make it december

-	thats three months - and have a
christmassy atmosphere i think thats
long enough-dont you  

  i wasnt sure and i suppose my ex-
pression said so

   just think she suggested and
watched my face closely  ive got to
play engaged to ralph all that time 

  that startled me more than that-
it hurt

   yes i suppose you must i
agreed  and that isnt very pleasant
is it but suppose we do make it three
months - what are we going to live
on we havent even the usual ex-
cuse that love will find a way

  she looked up quickly

  havent we i think we have if
were not afraid listen 

  our hands came together again by
the merest accident and while the taxi
rattled on margaret told me the story
of papa and papas friend

chapter viii

a braw nicht

  if a man cant talk safely behind
closed doors in his own house where
on earth can he do so
a thieves  comedy



  papa had taken his friend into the
library closing the door very tightly
but didnt think about the door leading
from the library into the music-room
it looked closed so it is to be sup-
posed that he did not bother about it

  toward the end of the interview
when his friend said a little excitedly
 we can send it up to five hundred if
we want to papa seemed to think of
the door leading to the music-room
and tiptoeing to it discovered that it
was not as tightly shut as he had
imagined

  throwing it open suddenly he found
margaret looking lazily up at him from
a copy of the libretto of the  pirates
of penzance

   what is it papa  she asked and
appeared so innocent and disinterested
that papa really did not know what it
was

   nothing-oh nothing at all he
said very fidgety  at the cross-roads of
doubt and fear and anger  but i
think you had better go to your room

  it was too late then however even
though papa actually thought his
daughter too unsophisticated to know
the meaning of a  corner on rand
island perhaps he imagined that
her young mind would conceive it to
be an acre or so of land but it
didnt

  not only did she know what a  cor-
ner  meant but also what it meant
to be  caught short fifty thousand
she hadnt been papas daughter for
eighteen years for nothing

  it was such a simple little corner
too

  the total issue of rand island stock
was two hundred thousand shares
papa and his friend had quietly ac-
cumulated one hundred and five
thousand fifty thousand of which their
victim had sold short in three months
at a rising price of from fifty to eighty
one man in san francisco held fifty
thousand but those were too far away
to be troublesome at a days notice

  the balance was scattered over the
country at large and papa and his

friend were gathering in everything
that lay near enough to new york to
be useful-probably ten thousand or
so pike the san francisco lot and
for the same reason the remainder was
not dangerous enough to  bother
about

  the victims name was not men-
tioned but it was the laudable inten-
tion of papa and his friend to reduce
his bank account considerably if not
actually relegate him to new street-
which is to say break him

  on wednesday of the following
week they would proceed to buy him
in bidding the stock up and up and up
knowing very well that almost every
share that could possibly be bought for
delivery the following day was in their
possession

  all that did margaret gather from
the libretto of the  pirates of pen-
zance  papas friend having a stac-
cato voice which would not suffer much
modulation and a habit of repeating
himself as if he were afraid he would
not be properly understood

  when margaret went to her room
she arranged the facts and figures nice-
ly upon a sheet of paper so that she
would not jumble them up afterward

  at a  conservative  estimate the
stock would go up to two hundred-
and the victim would enrich papa and
his friend six or seven millions

  the cab was circling central park
by that time how it got there i dont
know because i hadnt been paying
particular attention margarets cheeks
were a little flushed and a wayward
strand of her hair tickled my chin i
didnt mind

   that is very interesting i de-
clared when the story ended  how
much could i make with forty-five
hundred 

   oh-lots-but i want to make
something too not forme-for us
were in partnership

   i see that sounds rather pleas-
ant but you mustnt include the quarter
of a million you threw at my head a
little while ago


the all-story magazine

   i cant-because i cant touch it
till im twenty-one mama left it to
me i havent much ready cash and i
dont want to use what i have got be-
cause i think papa looks at my check-
book every day on the sly the only
thing i can do is to raise loans on my
rings and things-

   wh-what great guns child
wherever did you-

   youre silly she interrupted gen-
tly creeping a little nearer to me and
softly laughing my horror away
 why shouldnt i  it would only be
for a few days and i could stay in
bed with the shivers or something so
that i wouldnt have to wear them and
nobody would know they were gone
im sure you could raise forty-five hun-
dred on my pendant and necklace
alone

   i-could 

  she nodded in the most matter-of-
fact way in the world

  im eoing- to send them round to

	 a

you to-morrow when papa is out and
on monday morning about ten oclock
because its quieter then youll go to
nospims with them and get them to
loan you all you can

   then on thursday morning youll
get them out again that isnt diffi-
cult just think of me having to stay
in bedj pretending im terribly ill and
having to take all kinds of stupid
nasty medicines 

  i didnt say anything-just looked
and we studied each other for a minute
or two i got the worst of it no
man ever conflicted with eyes like those
and got off scathless

   now thats settled she announced
with a triumphant little smile  and
we are near the place where you must
get out when you do dont say good-
bv to me or anything just pay the
chauffeur and walk away he knows
where to go

jove youve got the whole busi-
ness down to a very fine science
have i her mouth twisted
queerly twixt a smile and a tear
 you see i was desperate-and ne-

cessity you know you dont think
im terribly brazen do you

   no-no of course not i rather
like it

  honestly

  her hand strayed to the lapel of my
coat in a proprietary sort of way and
i imagined she was a lonely little soul

   yes im quite certain of it were
you not just a little afraid 

  she glanced up quickly in surprise
of you no not a bit i think
you have the kindest face of any man
i ever met

  that settled it no one had ever
said anything quite so nice as that to
me before she owned me from that
moment and i would have given much
to have had sysonsby hear her say it
but it embarrassed me and to change
the subject i asked

   where did your aunt get that limp-
ing butler  

  gracious what a jump why
from england of course couldnt you
tell that  

   yes quite plainly ive seen him
before somewhere and im afraid he
recognized me

   oh please dont think that  she
clutched my arms fearfully  what
makes you think he did 

   nothing at all-just intuition i
thought he wrote that note the hand
is so very masculine it isnt yours
is it  

  she hesitated and looked away

   no it isnt mine

 well thats all right i said as
lightly as possible  dont lets bother
about it i just thought id like to-
the cab stopped and i did not finish
the sentence

   my station isnt it 

   yes and please dont be angry
you may kiss me if you think you
ought to

  since there was no time to study
the matter from more than one angle
i thought i ought to-and she did not
flinch

   good night-margaret i whis-
pered
a thieves comedy



   good night-jack-

  she crept away into her corner and
i stepped out upon the sidewalk
searching for money

  the chauffeur had not moved from
his seat

   whats the damage   i asked

   tin dollars he answered without
emotion looking straight ahead

  i paid - and found a card where
the bill had been it was a plain white
card with some writing on it

    its a braw nicht sir

  the depth and breadth of the sound
made me jerk my head up as the taxi
rolled away and i stared after it for
a minute or two till it vanished around
a corner

  then i struck a match and looked
more closely at the writing upon the
card

  congratulations meet me in half
  an hour at the  clachan of aber-
  foyle eleventh avenue and fifty-
  fourth street take a fifty-ninth
  street cross-town trolley to tenth ave-
  nue and fifty-fourth walk one block
  west

  that was crowded upon one side
the other had a border of small red
and black squares in the center was
neatly printed

for charity

chapter ix

  tiiu - clachan of aberfoyle

  i puleed up with a jerk under a
lamp that said  central park south 
-which mystified me completely-and
to save the bother of asking questions
i took a taxi unconscious that i was
then on fifty-ninth street which is
disguised for a few squares under the
above more pleasant-sounding title

  since campbell had said i was to

take a tram to tenth avenue and
fifty-fourth street i gave the chauf-
feur that direction and intended to
look about me before proceeding to
the  clachan which i presumed was
a public house or i suppose i should
say saloon to make myself more in-
telligible

  when i gave the instructions to the
chauffeur he asked me to repeat it and
apparently did not care for it any
more the second time than the first

  however we rattled across through
the glare of columbus circle getting
a glimpse of the giddy swirl of broad-
way which is more advertised than
any other thoroughfare anywhere

  its lights flashed a moment or two
and died out suddenly as we went 
toward eighth avenue which i have
since learned is distinguished princi-
pally for the consistency with which it
places a public place - i mean saloon
-on every corner and in having
trams that run direct to the polo
grounds

  the people one saw were different
there was a shuffling irresponsibility
in their movements - a stoop-shoul-
dered dejection that in tenth avenue
became still more dejected or in the
case of the younger generation form-
ing in little groups at every corner de-
veloped into an insolent swagger that
is both ugly and dangerous

  shadows that grew deeper and
deeper seemed to hang about every-
thing in spite of the electric light

  when my cab stopped and i got
out to pay the chap i found myself
at what appeared to be a tram-termi-
nal occupying practically a whole
square was a place where off-duty
trams are stored and repaired

  consequently there was plenty of
light and life and bustle of a sort peo-
ple getting into starting cars and peo-
ple getting out of cars coming in con-
ductors motormen and so forth

  but beyond that evidence of re-
spectable activity was an atmosphere
surcharged with unpleasant possibili-
ties


the ale-story magazine

  glancing about me and finding that
i was an object of interest for several
pairs of eyes probably because i had
come out of a taxicab and catching
sight of a very suspicious-looking chap
lurking in the shadow of the car-barn
wall opposite i turned quickly about
and walked toward the river

  out of the corner of my eye i saw
the fellow cross over and follow me

  the street was practically deserted
upon one side of it for three-quarters
of a block there is no sidewalk noth-
ing save the blank wall of the car-barn
and on the opposite side after one has
passed a few dimly lit shops the dull
fronts of a few factories a church and
some wretched frame houses

  under a lamp midway i sighted the
figure of a man hugging the wall
moving with a shambling gait toward
me while the soft pad of the feet be-
hind came nearer as i passed out of
the light of the shops

  naturally i hurried for a mo-
ment or two i had the wild suspicion
of a trap and of course remembered
that campbell had said i was a nui-
sance to some people he knew and that
a life could be bought for a meal

  then the man in front lurched un-
steadily out from the wall and imme-
diately staggered back to it again

  when i reached him a quick glance
told me that he was very drunk my
ears caught incoherent mumblings and
a perfectly distinct question as to the
whereabouts of nessie-whoever she
was

  i went right on

  the padding feet behind stopped

  almost instantly there were sounds
of conflict first of words-an inter-
mingling of strange oaths-then a
sharp scuffle terminating in a squeal
of pain

  it was none of my business and i
did not even turn my head to see what
had happened the lights of a public
house-dash it all why cant i write
saloon the first time-on the corner of
eleventh avenue were very inviting

  crossing the street as speedily as i

could without running i made a bee-
line for the place which being the
only one in sight i presumed must be
the clachan

  the swing-doors gave very readily
so readily that i was in the midst of
things as it were before i realized it
and bumped unpleasantly into a negro
who was on his way out

   oh i beg your pardon i apolo-
gized and the fellow first growling
a thick imprecation thrust out an
enormous hand grabbed me by the
shoulder and jerked me out of the way
in the most unceremonious fashion
and leered

   yo jes a puppy dawg he in-
formed me over his shoulder  an
a yaller pup at dat be glaid ah don
make sausage-meat ou o yer

  evidently spoiling for a fight he
opened his wide mouth and laughed
till the sound filled the place instantly
drawing upon us the attention of the
ugly motley crew about the bar

  they were a mixture of black and
vhite and to all appearances the scum
of both some bull-necked huge-
armed slant-eyed brutes others
scraggy and sniveling others lithe
quick and crafty all of them possibly
with a price hardly worth bothering
about

  they seemed to take my situation
in at a glance and their expressions
indicated that they were watching for
the sequel-to see what i would do
the black hulk of humanity who had
called me a  puppy  also waited

  of course im not a fool i ignored
the whole batch of them and appealed
to the red-faced giant behind the bar

   i have an appointment with a mr
campbell- i began and was instant-
ly interrupted by a burst of leering
laughter in which the barkeeper
joined

   guess youve got the wrong shop
he told me

   ya-as mistah puppy dawg my
insolent colored friend chipped in
 yo suahs in de wrong pew lak
crackers mistah puppy dawg
a thieves comedy



   here you cut that out 

  the advice came from the bartend-
er a trifle too late an oyster-cracker
plucked from the lunch-counter struck
me just a fraction below the left eye-
and it stung like the dickens

  with an effort i controlled my tem-
per while the others scenting sport at
my expense waited mumbling or
grinning their appreciation of the situ-
ation the bartender seemed unde-
cided for a minute or two my negro
leered again

   well mistah puppy dawg what
you gwine tub dew bout it

  if the gentleman behind the bar
and the gentlemen before it will give
me a chance and see fair play - ill
thrash you

  some one choked another guf-
fawed the rest muttered among them-
selves craning forward as if to get a
better look at me

  my negros leer slowly vanished i
did not take my eyes off his for a mo-
ment

   yoll trash me yew will 

  pi is great bulk suddenly lurched to-
ward me his enormous lists clenched
as if ready to pound me to a jelly

  the bartender called a warning
sharply the others backed away

  of course i was horribly scared
the fellow was so big and brutal and
i was not at all certain of a fair chance
there wasnt much room either to
give me the use of my legs to escape
the awful weight of the fellows fists

  sidestepping i took him on the
chin and jabbed his nose before he
had any opportunity to know what
had happened he bellowed like a
bull swung his arms like the sails of
a windmill and because i wasnt there
to get the benefit of it all he flopped
wildly across a small table-to the ex-
treme joy of every one but the bar-
tender whose white apron i was hazily
conscious of seeing flying over the bar

  the negro staggered upright wiping
some blood from his face and an
ominous growl sounded behind me as
the bartender suddenly seized my arm

   leave him be 

   gee  hes a white hope 

   he aint so green 

   kill him batch  soak it to him  

   aw-have a heart beat it mis-
ter while your shoes are good 

  a jumble of comment came from
the crowd the bartender rushed me
toward the door and i made no resist-
ance

  a horrible oath sounded behind me
-and the scuffling rush of many feet

  suddenly the doors parted inwardly

   gregarach 

  the queer sounding name burst
from several throats and the sudden
quiet that followed it was like a pall

  my escort halted and his hand fell
from my arm the ardor of the others
went out like a snuffed lamp all at
once i felt peculiarly safe

  within the doorway stood a man in
a long rain-coat reaching to his ankles
and wearing a broad-brimmed felt hat
drawn well down over his eyes

  by the height and girth of him i
knew it was campbell

chapter x

 thu gregarach

  for a moment or two he stood per-
fectly still ignoring me completely his
steely glance going over my shoulder
to the silent group behind

  then all at once he moved passing
me like a cavalry charge and as i
quickly turned my head i heard the
unmistakable impact of fist with face
and saw my negro crumple and sink
to the floor

  something glittering white slipped
from his hand and slid along the oil-
cloth almost to my feet

  i stooped and picked it up-a razor

  batchs friends appeared anxious to
get as far away from the conflict as
possible leaving half-finished  beers 
strung out upon the bar and herding
toward the  family entrance  which
afforded an exit upon eleventh
avenue


the all-story magazine

  my negro made no effort to rise
he lay so strangely still that i began
to feel chilly when campbell standing
over the huddled form turned his face
slowly toward me and asked in still
broader scotch than he had used on
the randania

   do ye no place ony niair value on
yer life than to pick a quarrel wi
this scum  and indicating batch he
looked at the bartender sharply  ill
speak tae ye about this later andy
see that somebody take him hame
wheres beans  

  as he put the question he caught my
eye and jerked his head toward the
door of a room which a placard de-
clared was  closed

  the negro stirred and moaned but
his evil-countenanced brethren made
no move to his assistance they were
afraid of campbell uncertain of his
attitude toward them and eyed me up
and down dully and questioningly

   beans was here less than half an
hour ago the bartender replied to
campbells question speaking to the
back of the latters head as my queer
friend moved in the direction of the
room he had indicated  he said he
was just going up to tenth avenue
send him in tae me when he comes
back

  i followed him into the room
marked  closed in which were sev-
eral small round tables with cane-bot-
tomed chairs arranged about them
upon the walls were colored prints of
equine favorites jockeys and ballet-
dancers

  campbell closed the door behind me
shutting out the parasitical crew in the
family entrance and glancing about
the room as if to be sure that we were
to be quite alone waved me to- a chair
his actions were peculiarly deliberate
and cautious and he apparentlv con-
sidered the dim light we had sufficient

  the member of select society had
vanished even the face seemed
changed his long tan overcoat might
have belonged to a hack-driver and
his shoes were in keeping with it

  following his every movement
blankly i sat down

  then i found him looking down at
me and smiling

   im afraid he said dryly  that
if margaret saw you now with that
fearsome weapon in your hand she
would hesitate about taking another
cab-ride with you

  i put the razor which i had been
clutching upon the table

   thats better he conceded seat-
ing himself opposite me and stretching
out his great legs revealed some of the
awful checked suit he wore below his
coat  a razor is a particularly deadly
thing in the hands of a man like batch
who would have had as little compunc-
tion about slitting your jugular as i
would have in breaking a match he
does not come here very often but
when he does there is always trouble
of some sort the last time he was
here i told andy not to serve him
again

   and i suppose the bartender had
been obeying orders i suggested
feeling that andv was possibly being
misjudged  i collided with the beg-
gar as he was going out and he was
as mad as the dickens but how is it
that andy didnt know who i meant
when i asked for mr campbell 

  my companion suddenly pounded
the table with his fist in vigorous pro-
test making the razor dance

   campbell dinna  campbell  me
here my name is  macgregor and
them that ken me best ca me the
gregarach if ye would be safe
hereabout an mak freens an keep
them yell remember that

  i suppose i looked bewildered and
uncertain of how to take his advice
his expression became less thunder-
ous

   gregarach means the chief mac-
gregor he explained quietly  even
beans borrowman uses the word and
hardly knows that it is gaelic or if he
does is not sure whether gaelic is a
language or a country

   beans i may inform you is one
a thieves comedy



of the few-the very few-pickpock-
ets-or dips as they call themselves-
in the business who has been clever
enough to avoid working for uncle
sam i advised him to be at fifty-
fourth street and tenth avenue to
meet you and cant understand why
he didnt i presume you came by
trolley 

  no - i took a taxi- i began
and he scowled so i stopped to see if
he intended to put the scowl into
words  but i got out at tenth ave-
nue and fifty - fourth street and
walked down here

  the scowl vanished

   there was a chap - very suspi-
cious i thought-hugging the car-barn
wall at the corner and when i started
down here he followedime but stopped
half-way down the street to scrap with
a drunken fellow who seemed anxious
about  nessie 

  the gregarach - i must remember
that name because to be quite frank
i think it was a salve to campbells
vanity-nodded his head slowly sev-
eral times and his eyebrows heavy
and of a dark-red hue rose and fell

   yes-i suppose that was beanss
father filial duty comes before all
else or it should and doubtless in pre-
venting that blatherskite of a father of
his from getting too far from home
he was doing me a service

   when borrowman senior is sober
he is a plasterer perpetually unem-
ployed when he is drunk he talks
incessantly and often dangerously of
matters that are of no concern of his
but which might be interesting to what
writers are pleased to call  the limbs
of the law

   by the way i believe that reliable
information against the gregarach is
worth a bonny penny in mulberry
street and will probably be worth
more when we have disposed of the
rollins matter

  if you should meet a detective
named parks a central office man he
is you could possibly make five thou-
sand by telling him where he could

find me in the daytime i met him in
the city hall yesterday as i came out
of the surrogates office and he touched
his hat to me very respectfully funny
isnt it  

  i laughed in spite of myself and
felt myself slipping into his net with-
out a struggle as if it were the most
natural thing in the world to do

  his contempt for parks and what
parks represented was supreme one
could not help admiring him and there
was no hint of treachery in his face

   you have taken a lot for granted
with me i declared  that card you
gave me-a newspaper report i read-
and--this-why man i know enough
to-

   believe what i am going to tell
you he interrupted calmly removing
his hat and barkening to the muffled
sounds that came from the barroom
and the street

   i take nothing for granted in any
man he continued  from batch
upward but when a man needs me
and i need him there is a bond of faith
already established

   i have introduced you to rollins
made you suffer his company given
you a glimpse of his daughter as he
affects her and as she really is and
shown you a way of redeeming what
your fathers have lost whether you
take advantage of the chance is your
own affair but now i am going to
tell you a story and i found it neces-
sary to bring you here because i want
you to know the place thoroughly

  i gaped

   what the dickens does it matter
whether-

   seems strange doesnt it 

  he studied my face curiously

   but no more strange than the fact
that if you died rollins would become
the-earl of didderington

   what 

  i almost screamed it and jumped
half out of my chair to lean across the
table and stare into his quiet eyes

  he nodded

   wait this is beans


the all-story magazine

  he spoke very low and glanced to-
ward the door and as i sank limply
back into my chair feeling that i was
being cheated by the delay a young
man cap in hand slipped into the
room closing the door noiselessly

   the old man- he began hur-
riedly as he came forward

   i know the gregarach inter-
rupted  batch gone 

   yes sir saw him bein helped up
th avnoo sir

   good shake hands with mr
mason mason this is my lieutenant
and friend-mr beans borrowman
beanss hand shot forward and i
rose and took it gravely

   glad to know you sir he said in
a peculiarly quiet voice while i mut-
tered something about the pleasure
being mutual trying to grasp the fact
that i was hobnobbing with thieves
and all sorts of questionable people

  meeting him in a casual way one
would never have taken the trouble to
look at beans twice he suggested the
young ill-paid mechanic who counts
each new suit or pair of shoes as being
 so much at so much per week

  his face seemed dusty encouraging
an inclination to wipe it off witha dry
rag and the curious gray eyes that
looked out at one from under strangely
scattered eyebrows gave one the im-
pression that the world was an ever-
lasting surprise to him in his build--
of medium height his shoulders slight-
ly guilty of the slouch of his class--
there was a hint of supple strength and
quickness

  put him to bed the gregarach
asked lightly referring to the  old
man

   yes sir-strapped

   good della been round to-day  
 no sir aint seen her since mon-
day sir

   um-all right take this round
to mrs phalen-and tell her to pay
two months rent out of it shes one
in arrears you know and im afraid
danny doesnt tell her the whole truth
about these things

  his eyes swung lazily upon me

   mrs phalen is blind he advised
and turned to beans again  tell
danny hes to go to corcorans mon-
day morning at eight sharp time-
keeper and you might slip into
blakeleys and ask him about his rheu-
matism doc briggs was to see him
to-day davie marks and his sister
get away all right  

   yes sir beans replied taking the
proffered envelope as a matter of
course  the kid was looking pretty
bad sir

  a furrow appeared between the
gregarachs eyes

   yes-its a pity we didnt know
sooner but colorado springs should
help heard anything from bran-
nigan  

  just a card from phoenix sir he
says its all to the mustard down there
sir

   i hope so gibbs seems to be sur-
viving at any rate and he was in
worse shape than brannigan any re-
ports from crabbe or paler 

   crabbe sent crowley down to say
there was nothin doin yet-an paler
will be in to-morrow greggs bunch
are mostly hangin round when you
was away they wouldnt woik for me
steady and i think youll have to talk
to gregg sir

   his crowd gets nasty roun me-
hollerin for a bigger rakeoff and want-
in to get back to shootin up the town
lyin low woikin quiet gets on their
noives an what wit batch tryin to
get the lumber gang to come down
an muss us up-i aint had much of
a chanst to git em woikin as id like
sir

  i could only dimly understand-like
the chap who hears two doctors hold-
ing a consultation over him but the
gregarach listened attentively eying
his lieutenant in quiet interrogation

   sure you are not losing your grip
-hunting for smith  

  beans pulled his head back as if
avoiding a bloav quite evidently the
reference to smith had startled him
a thieves comedy



   no sir he answered sullenly
 i aint had time to hunt for him an
i give you my woid before you went
to europe that i wouldnt do nothin
till you got back aint that right  

   quite right- but please be careful
not to get too indignant with me i
dont like it you can put gregg on
batchs track that will give him
something to do and if batch shows
signs of being a trouble-maker-gregg
has a free hand outside of guns and
things like this

  he held up the negros razor looked
steadily at beans for a moment or two
then handed it over to him

   throw it into the river and see
gregg if you can to-night when you
are going out tell andy ive forgiven
him-and to keep a careful eye upon
that door mr mason and i do not
wish to be disturbed good night

   good night sir beans returned
and nodding to me went swiftly and
noiselessly out

  i glanced into campbells face and
found him amused

   that was a nuisance wasnt it 
he asked as if he appreciated my anx-
iety to get back to rollins  but now
its done and we will resume our
acquaintance with mr r

chapter xi

thu story he told

  a burst of raucous laughter came
from the barroom a cart of some
sort rattling down the street and a
motor-horn not far off were among
the last sounds i heard before camp-
bell with his eyes going steadily over
my shoulder toward the door began
the story that even made the tables
round about me fade as i watched his
face and listened

  it began with the elopement of lady
alice didderington and bob dolliver
away back in  apparently they
had emigrated to new york where
their only child alice dolliver was
born

  she in her turn married a chap
named ralph rollins and they had
two children-the rollins of my story
and mrs van huysen

  lady alice had lived to see her
grandchildren married and to welcome
another generation into the world she
died in the fall of 

  the campbells and the rollins-dol-
liver families had grown up together
-financially as well as socially

  when campbell was a boy he used
to sit on lady alices knee while she
told him of her memories of water-
loo and of the things in her childhood
that had frightened her

  one always remembers the things in
ones infant days that frightened one
and her father seemed to have been re-
markable in that particular even as
a great-grandmother she still appeared
rather afraid of him

  campbell was in the room an hour
before she died he said she was a
good old soul-a sort of second
mother to him after his own died she
was in a sort of delirium but she knew
him and made him kneel by the bed
and speak to her

  mrs van huysen was there and a
nurse and a doctor but the old lady
held on to him in spite of them and
while she was rumpling his hair some-
times talking rationally sometimes
rambling she suddenly said quite
clearly

   i can see it robbie  over there-
the old lodge-gate and-hes lying on
his face-so still-so terribly still 

  i found campbell peering at me
suddenly through half-closed lids

   there wras a fear in that old wom-
ans eyes i shall never forget he said
quietly  fear of something terrible
you know how her father died 

   yes i replied wondering what
he was driving at  he was shot in
the back of the head at the lodge-
gate

  a shadow of disappointment crossed
his face and i had a strange suspicion
that he knew more of my family his-
tory than i did


the all-story magazine

  evidently they put him out of the
room after that but he was a boy of
fourteen at the time and he never for-
got it

  then he came to the near present
which was more important than a cen-
tury-old mystery

  rollins in campbells opinion was
the reincarnation of the forefather of
mine who was shot at the lodge-gate
there was nothing too mean for him
nothing too low

  his intention had been to give his
daughter and his nephew the deeds to
didderington on their wedding-day
that was his original and only idea in
taking up all the mortgages

  campbell gave him the other one

  i didnt know what he meant but
he went on without looking at me

   you see rollins knew who and
what i am in my leisure hours hes
known it ever since that night i took
my safety and bonny nessie borrow-
man by the hand and made him prom-
ise by all his gods to marry her

   good heavens 

  my exclamation fell to a whisper

   and the next day he slipped out of
my hands for london

  i might as well not have been in the
room for all the attention he paid to
me and as he produced his watch in
a lackadaisical sort of way glancing at
it as if the hour did not interest him
he added without looking at me

   rollins is the  smith  for whom
beans is looking

  feeling limp and horror-stricken i
sat watching my companions face
wondering what i could say then as
if he knew what i wanted to ask he
continued in a low monotone still
watching the door

   he met her while she was on the
road with the  foibles the program
called her lily beaufort she was a
good girl rough of course given to
slang and the gossip of the dressing-
room but when she was in new york
she spent most of her time keeping her
father out of saloons

   i forgot the name rollins gave

her-somers or somerville i think it
was-but he did not let the matter rest
in rochester perhaps for a few
months he was actually infatuated with
her and met her frequently during that
time even in new york

  the girl trusted him implicitly
though heaven knows how she man-
aged it and when she came to tell
campbell-macgregor as she knew
him-about it her description of
rollins particularly of his cravats
gave him away completely i could
readily believe that rollinss neck-
wear to any one who knew him was
fatal

  after he ran away to europe camp-
bell lost all trace of miss borrowman
for several months then he got a
note from a stranger saying that the
girl wished to see him 

  he found her in passaic living with
a girl who used to be in the same com-
pany

   what transpired at the bedside
campbell declared as if the memory
was a particularly painful one  does
not matter but that poor girl died
because she did not want to live

  she had not told of having ap-
proached campbell before or anything
about his previous connection with the
affair nothing but the fact that smith
had promised to marry her and had run
off to europe

  five minutes after she died her
sister and beans arrived

  they too had been sent for at the
dead girls request but her friend could
tell them nothing except the name by
which miss borrowman knew rollins
so they called him smith for short

  beans was murderous at once he
haunted the docks for weeks search-
ing for a man whom he had never
seen and of whom he had no descrip-
tion

  nessie borrowmans erstwhile room-
mate was more sensible while beans
was clamoring for blood she was won-
dering if smith had any money and
claimed with much wisdom that a dead
smith wouldnt be worth much the
a thieves comedy



longer he lived the longer he would
pay

   and thats all you need know about
it campbell finished abruptly  i
have protected rollinss worthless life
for a year and kept beans from-mur-
der

  i think i shrank a little

   aye-its an ugly word but beans
and his kind havent much method in
their madness they are gathered
from the ends of the earth the ragged
ends mostly-born behind the bars al-
most-and their manners are crude
they dig great holes in their enemies
and scatter gore about shamefully but
man theyre bairns when you handle
them right-just bairns

   i suppose so i said and waited

   rollins would sell me to-morrow
if he dared he continued heavily
but he is afraid not so much of
me as of mv people-

  there was something akin to pride
in that  my people in that moment
i felt that somewhere in his life was
a sorrow that gnawed one for which
rollins might have been responsible
and of which he did not care to speak

   in this city it would take months
to prove anything against me-if any-
thing were ever proved at all and rol-
lins is afraid of what might happen in
the interval

   but he is a constant menace-you
can appreciate that-hating me in-
tensely for my knowledge my idea is
that when he finally goes to england
he will leave a message with detective
parks before he sails

   you dont mean to say that he
would-

  why not campbell questioned
 he is quite capable of it if he thought
he wouldbe safe in england i tell you
the man is small and he is afraid of me

   to make it worse he thinks i am
so afraid of him that i am likely to
put beans on his track at any time and
he has not forgotten the night when i
pictured to him what would happen if
the girls brother ever found him it
was pressure of that sort that brought

    	s

from him the promise he made the girl
and me and i suppose the same pres-
sure induced him to take the first boat
to europe

   but when he got back couldnt
you-

   a few weeks before i heard of
nessie borrowmans story he inter-
rupted and as if i had not spoken  i
went to him on another matter-never
mind why-and i told him to buy the
didderington estates kill you and be-
come an earl all by himself if he want-
ed to but for heavens sake to give
his daughter a chance to grow up and
choose a husband for herself

  i sat up a little straighter in my
chair

   he told me to go to the devil
campbell continued easily  and
after the exchange of a few compli-
ments i left

   after he had crawled back from
europe we avoided each other for a
while if i thought he was to be at
the van huysens i would not go
there and he never appeared while i
was on the scene i think he was
afraid of what i might do if i met him
-and so was i then--he came to
me

  rollins had declared that it was a
friendly call to bury the hatchet and
so forth as he spoke he fumbled
nervously with his hands as if he did
not know what to do with them

  pie took a chair by the table under
a lamp the light of which made the
round bald spot on the top of his head
glisten like a billiard-ball host and
guest were in evening clothes and the
latter was constantly casting slanting
glances of apparent understanding to-
ward several newspapers that had
fallen beside campbells chair

  a prominent banker had been shot
and killed in the bronx the evening
before

  the papers said uncomplimentary
things about the police and spoke of
the baffling machiavelian demoraliz-
ing-all those adjectives mind you-
effectiveness of organization among a


the all-story magazine

company of west end youths gen-
erally and fearfully referred to as the
 rob roy gang

  campbell had been reading the things
people were saying about his  boys
and knowing that they had nothing to
do with the horrible business he was
rather annoyed everything that was
at all clever in a criminal way in new
york was laid at their door which be-
came very unfair when murder was the
charge since the gegarach had no
patience with people who could not take
a mans money and give him a chance
to feel the loss

  when rollins came campbell at
once believed he had come to speak of
the murder-a natural conclusion since
his visitor was aware of his hosts con-
nection with the accused rob roy
gang

  but no-it was just a friendly call
he had hoped that campbell had come
to realize how utterly impossible that
other thing had been and since he and
campbells father had been such bo-
som friends since campbell had been
such a favorite with the late lady
alice it was really a pity they could
not understand each other better

  and rollinss gaze traveled mean-
ingly to the newspapers upon the floor
but he did not mention the bankers
death-not a syllable

  campbell agreed with him gave him
to drink and to smoke a d waited

  rollins trifling with his glass ap-
peared to steady himself and apropos
of nothing at all asked quite sud-
denly 

   i wonder if that fool on the other
side can possibly scrape together the
mortgage on that lodge its only
fifty thousand you know 

   he might-just to be devilish
campbell returned easily  you want
that piece of property pretty badly
dont you 

  rollinss eyes narrowed a little he
side-stepped his hosts question

   oh im not worrying about it-
no not at all-but id like to get it
my grandfather dolliver was born in

the lodge you know and it will spoil
the whole thing if i dont get it-con-
found him 

   who your grandfather or-

   that nincompoop who calls him-
self the earl of course

   hes never done you any harm has
he

  harm him rubbish rollins
laughed at the idea  in a year or two
probably the useless penniless fool will
be defiling his name in cheap lodgings
in bloomsbury or be peddling shoe-
laces on my sidewalk in a year from
now ill have everything he owns but
his title -here he glanced at the
newspapers again then quickly up into
campbells face- and i could buy
that for a miserly little ten-dollar bill

   yes i suppose you could the host
agreed carelessly  i know where you
coidd do it for less if you were not
particular about the company you
kept

  rollins almost knocked over his
glass he mumbled something unin-
telligible and tried to appear as if he
had not heard what campbell had
said

  startled from its gloomy lair the
thing upon rollinss mind had jumped
into light and though it vanished just
as quickly campbell pulled it out again
and kept it there watching it grow

   it does seem a pity that the thread
of one mans life should stand between
you and a coronet its such a tiny
thread too-that could be cut in a
second if there were three or four
people in the way it would be different
-but one-just one  galling isnt
it

  rollinss cheeks went white and red
in turn

   down in the kitchen campbell
resumed  we do those things scien-
tifically a mans life is only worth
so much as he is willing to pay to keep
it some men love to live others ap-
parently do not care particularly

   i am judging by the price they
offer it is an interesting study-and
ones hands can be kept quite clean
a thieves comedy



there are professionals you know
who do that sort of thing for a song
and get drunk upon the music they
kill between drinks as it were

  rollins listened like a starving man
in sight of food and campbell led him
on with lies-wonderful murderous
lies

  have you ever met a man who is
aching to find some one who is as big
a scoundrel as himself to whom he
can talk and from whom he may per-
haps get advice and encouragement 

   that campbell told me  was
rollins that night

  my existence was tearing at his liver
like a vulture and the more he thought
of it the more he suffered it was such
a little barrier the most unreliable
thing in the world so slender and un-
certain that in a second of time it could
be wiped out-even with the flash of
a ten-dollar bill

  in the light of the lamp rollinss
complexion had turned the color of
cigar-ash his mouth struggled to
form words that would not come

   once you told me-to do it you
know he said thickly  ive won-
dered since if you meant it

  campbell nodded slowly as if killing
a man were a thing of no importance
rollins scrutinized him plainly uncer-
tain of how to accept his point of view
then his attention was drawn to the
newspapers again

   but if-suppose we-that is-
how would he come over to the
states

   thats simple the least of our
troubles do you want him brought
over  

  rollins hesitated then quite suddenly
swung upon campbell and leaned to-
ward him

   lets understand each other he
demanded in the tone of a man who is
tired of subterfuge yet is angry at
having to come out of concealment
 youre a crook and i know it that
thing in the newspapers would not do
you any good if i went to headquar-
ters with a story

   all right campbell agreed un-
abashed  go on

   well-you know-what i want
is that a threat campbells
voice was very low

   nothing like that im not going
to kill the goose that may lay the
golden eggs

   you mean  

    suggestions

   i see campbell rose lazily
 here is one listen and take it home
with you if you dont like it bring
it back and ill perhaps exchange it for
a better one

   well-what is it  rollins was
hoarse with eagerness

     know a young thug campbell
said very deliberately  who has mur-
der in his eye for a man he has never
seen that thug is anxious to meet an
englishman named  smith  who-
killed his brother in london if the
earl of didderington were in my way
as he is in yours id be very friendly
-with him and then wed do a little
slumming one evening

   we would go to a place i know
near the river where we should be sure
to meet the young man looking for
smith id find an opportunity to talk
to that young man for a minute or
two and then id go back to my friend
the earl and wait to watch him die 

   good heavens  

  the exclamation was mine t start-
ed to my feet while the tables and
chairs swarmed about me i stood
gaping down at him but there was
no change in campbells expression

   of course he went on and his
head bent forward a little as if he were
interested in something upon the floor
near the door  i told rollins he
would have to arrange it a little differ-
ently but pointed out that it was the
safest thing in the world

   he saw that it was and took the
idea home with him later as i knew
he would he brought it back again
saying he could not use it since he did
not know the man who was looking
for smith


the all-story magazine

  campbells interest in the door be-
came more keen and his head bent
lower

   i said he could become acquainted
with my thug for fifty thousand dol-
lars but he balked on the price until
a month ago when i suggested that
you might marry and have children
campbells hand went to the inside
pocket of his coat and when he spoke
it was in a whisper of caution

   that settled it and we came to
terms ten thousand when i got you
over here another ten when i intro-
duced him to the man looking for
smith and the rest-when the job was
done 

 what

   wheesht he paid the first ten
on monday here is my check for it
and he held out a white slip of paper
to me

chapter xii

a loose end

  i stared at the thing and pulled
away from it for a few moments i
didnt know whether to laugh or run
and since i couldnt move because i was
semiparalyzed i laughed foolishly

  the whole business seemed so queer
and creepy-and silly

  some one was being made an ass of
and i wasnt at all certain that it was
rollins even when campbell thrust the
bally thing into my hand and i saw
in open-mouthed wonder that it was in
truth a check made out to john t
mason by r m campbell for the sum
of ten thousand dollars

   but-good lord man 

   wheesht tak it wha has a bet-
ter right to the price of your life than
you  

  he got upon his feet crammed his
hat upon his head and pulled the brim
down over his eyes

   come and ill show you the
emergency exit there is the reason
see it

  my mind struggled valiantly out of

a misty haze the sounds in the bar-
room seemed suddenly to grow louder
glancing in the direction campbells
large index-finger pointed i saw
fastened to the wall to the right of
the door a little black box and as i
looked a green light came and went
twice

   jove-thats-

   quiet campbell cautioned  not
now well go home

  there was nothing for me to do but
follow though i had no idea of what
was up and as i tiptoed after him it
seemed as if every board was yelling
out against me while in spite of his
great bulk he made scarcely any sound
whatever

  reaching a door in the rear of the
room he turned the key in it noise-
lessly and allowed me to pass out into
the darkness of a place like a kitchen

   wait he whispered and i halted
while he closed and locked the door
thrusting the key into his pocket

  then he was at my side gripping my
arm

   the door is right ahead he ad-
vised in a low monotone  so when
you need it dont waste valuable time
searching for it since the case isnt
urgent to-night ill give you a light

  in a moment there was a slight click
and a single electric bulb showed me
that the place was really a kitchen
which by the look of it was not often
used

   andy knows we are gone now i
was told and i saw that beside the
switch was a push-button on which his
finger rested

   what does that do-ring a bell  

   hardly bells talk too plainly a
little white light under the bar is telling
the story and a certain emissary from
a ward politician who is anxious to
know how i feel toward the november
election will wait patiently for an hour
or two helping to swell my profits-

  your profits i exclaimed in-
credulously

    exactly this place belongs to me
if i didnt take the money from those
a thieves comedy



fools they would spend it elsewhere
and their dependents would never get
it back but we cant stand here dis-
cussing my methods

  and putting out the light without
further parley he half led half pushed
me toward the door suddenly gripping
my hand and thrusting it against the
knob so that my fingers took hold of
the thing instinctively

   dont turn it-pull it to the right
he instructed  it cant be opened
from the outside except with a key
thats right -as i pulled the door
open- now were in the yard

  we passed into the open air into the
midst of gaunt shadows and the door
clicked behind us

   the gate is on the left in the upper
corner thats the way to walk right
into the street and the other fellows
gun if its as bad as that the other
way is to turn to the right to the wire
fence and even if you try to miss it it
wont miss you

   creep under it and keep on until
you have gone under one more wire
fence and over one rickety board one
the board fence will tell you not to
go any farther after youve gotten over
it then you will be in brannigans
yard and you will go up to his back
door walk right in and if you say
 gregarach  hell let you stay

   he has a little cancly-store front-
ing on eleventh avenue and he lives
in the rear of it there is nothing that
you need be afraid pi the two stores
between the clachan and brannigans
are vacant and always will be because
i keep them so i pay rent to myself
for them think you can remember
all that 

   it is just so much gibberish to
me i expostulated

   man-but youre an inquisitive
soul just tell me now if you can re-
member two wire fences one board
fence and brannigans back door can
you  

   i think so i answered

   i hope so but ill write it down
for you when we get home

   home 

   my home he answered tersely
 weve got a few things yet to say to
each other and well be fairly respect-
able to-night and go out by the street
gate doesnt the air feel good-even
here 

  fie drew a great deep breath as we
passed out into the dimly lit street and
headed toward tenth avenue and in-
stantly i marveled at the mans utter
disregard for any sort of disguise or
concealment apparently he walked
about under the noses of the police
without a particle of concern for his
safety

   youre a cool beggar  i declared
as we crossed over to- the sidewalk

  campbell laughed and took hold of
my arm again

   dinna be feart my mannie he
soothed irritatingly and continued in a
low cautious tone you are safer
here with me than you will be in
rollinss place to-morrow there is a
policemanat the corner too and if i
condescend to notice him he will say

	good avnin sorr like a gentleman

  if you asked him who i was he
would probably tell you that i was a
 quare scotch gintlemin phwat owns
the worrust saloon in hells kitchin
an is thryin to turn the place into a
sivinth hivin an not doin so bad at
that wit givin the force less worruk
than it ivir had in thim parrts he
and his captain may have a thousand
suspicions about my connections with
a certain company whose methods are
like nothing the police has ever had to
handle before and parks of the cen-
tral office may have a thousand more
ideas about me

   but suspicion and evidence are
widely different things besides which
is more important they know that mr
macgregor can make or unmake any
gentleman with political aspirations
hereabout-and that mr macgregor
has money-oh lots of money- i
wonder who the lady is  

  a woman had appeared within the
light of the few little shops at the


the all-story magazine

tenth avenue corner she was coming
toward us evidently in a great hurry

  whether young or old i could not
tell but my companions pace slack-
ened and he seemed to gage his steps
so that we would meet her under a
lamp-post

  and we did campbell came to a
full stop and of course i with him
the woman almost collided with us
a foot away she raised her eyes from
the ground with the light shining full
upon her face

 greg-she began and stopped as
if his look had choked off the rest of it

  there was no hat upon her head
she was young-under twenty-five-
a little gaudily but cheaply clothed and
her cheeks were marred by color put
on with a too lavish hand

  evidently she hailed from southern
europe and her eyes were wonderful
--very dark and afraid she fumbled
with her hands and appeared to await
anxiously the gregarachs observa-
tions

   you were coming to see me  
campbell asked quietly

   no sir

   then you were going to confes-
sion  

  he turned his head to where farther
down the street was the church of
saint-ive forgotten the chaps name

   no sir

   then well take you home camp-
bell declared decisively  where is
tony 

   i don know sir the girl whim-
pered and sought the support of the
lamp-post  two week i no see him

   i think i can find him campbell
declared  and when i do ill tell
him you came to me and asked me to
brinsr him back to vou how will

o	

that do  

  i doubted if the girl understood
every word but she grasped the mean-
ing of the lie better than i judging by
the frightened look that sprang into
her eyes she made no comment but
allowed campbell to take her arm and
lead her back the way she had come

  of course i felt out of it complete-
ly  but with the check my strange
friend had given me burning a hole in
my pocket and a million questions
fighting each other for precedence on
my tongue i walked with them specu-
lating upon what was going to happen
next

  campbell did not speak nor the girl
nor i when we reached the corner of
tenth avenue one of the usual little
groups lounging about a saloon-door
said  good evenin sir almost in
unison and the policeman now mov-
ing up the street echoed it in a county
cork accent

  i was not sure during the short walk
whether i was standing on the rim of
a volcano or walking with a king on
parade but it was apparent before
we had gone two squares that in that
section he who could claim the friend-
ship of the gregarach might walk
in perfect safety

  the girl ignored me completely as
is i were a rank outsider and when
after going a few squares campbell
said  wait please and vanished
into an entry above which was an in-
timation that one could play pool for
two and a half cents per cue i felt
stupid with a nasty sensation that i
should say something to her yet feared
a snub for my pains

  before i could decide campbell re-
appeared with a little man like the boot-
black at the hotel

  expecting a demonstration yet ho-
ping there wouldnt be one in such a
public place i was really disappointed
in the denouement

  campbell simply said

  tony your wife isnt very well
so she came to me and asked me to tell
you that she wanted you to come back
to her take her home

  tony looked from one to the other
sheepishly he was hardly as steady
as he might have been and when he
took hold of his wifes arm i thought
she would be more likely to take him
home

   ari mister he mumbled thickly
a thieves comedy



 you fin a man-yessir tony badcla
man getta gooda wife we go
tonys wife said nothing but she
shrank from him and for a moment
her eyes met campbells

  there was hate in them and despair
and loathing - a queer mixture the
battle of a weakened soul against the
inevitable  would not have cared to
have had the venom in it directed at me

   good night mrs varelli camp-
bell said softly and turned and drew
me away we crossed tenth avenue
and walked up fifty-seventh street

   why did you lie to that man  i
asked  she hates the little beast

   aye she hates him campbell ad-
mitted broadly- and with fair rea-
son he stays away from her for
weeks and comes back to her when his
money is gone she works in a fac-
tory and supports herself he is a
cheap sort of poolroom thief whom
ive kept out of jail twice and that
is why they respect what i say and
make a bluff of being satisfied

   but theres no gratitude in that
little rat hell be off again in a week
if not sooner and some day hell kill
some one and shiver in a condemned
cell till they take him out to end a life
that began somewhere on the sunny
shores of sicily

   i suppose so i agreed  but
that doesnt explain the lie altogether
 well it wouldnt have done if i
had told tony that his wife was on
the way to look for beans borrowman
when i met her

   the deuce she was 

   exactly campbell admitted with
a trace of annoyance  and i cant
afford to have my lieutenants mixed
up with sicilian carving-knives at this
time of the year winter is coming
on and thats our busy season

chapter xiii

an interruption

  between eighth and ninth ave-
nues in one of the fifties there is

a row of brown-stone houses all alike
and intothe basement of one of these
campbell led me

  i am careful about the location of
the house because i believe some one
has rented it since macgregor gave
it up and i do not wish the people to
be embarrassed in any way

  the neighbor on campbells right
so he told me kept  roomers hav-
ing a card in the parlor window to
that effect while the neighbor on the
left kept dogs - little white woolly
beasts-which were bred in the music-
room and sold in the parlor

  they were all queer animals who
lived in that street coming out of their
houses like winter clothes emerging
from among the moth-balls musty
dusty people with pasts and presents
and heaven knows what futures

  so campbell excited no particular
attention

  he had rented the house furnished
he informed me beans and the rest
knew nothing of his connection with
any other establishment or life than
that they knew where he lived and
when people are thoroughly satisfied
that they have ones address they do
not seem to feel the necessity for
searching further

  r m campbell gentleman at lei-
sure of central park west and several
fifth avenue clubs and robert mac-
gregor of fifty- street and the
 clachan of aberfoyle were two
distinct personalities though he adopt-
ed no disguise except the clothes he
wore and the scotch accent he af-
fected

  on fifth avenue he dressed ac-
cordingly in fifty--street and as

the proprietor of a disreputable sa-
loon his attire created no comment
because it talked loudly enough to si-
lence all argument

  i could understand that quite plain-
ly when he removed his coat there
was no mistaking the language of that
screeching check suit or of the great
diamond that gleamed beneath a revo-
lutionary tie the links of his watch-


the all-story magazine

chain were of the proper size and
weight stretching from pocket to
pocket of a waistcoat which  fancy 
does not even hint at

  he carried it all as though to the
manner born with a bluster to which
his height and breadth lent emphasis
and his huge hairy hands gave me a
keener understanding of why batch
the negro had collapsed so suddenly

  with the shades carefully drawn
and one incandescent burner shedding
its light upon us we sat down in the
dining-room

  apparently there was no one else in
the house a piano across the street
played ragtime accompanied by a
chorus of voices in several other keys

  the rumble of the trams and ele-
vated trains joined in at intervals and
in the lulls we were granted the sound
of occasional footsteps could be heard
with remarkable distinctness

  some of the passers-by shuffled
along as if their shoes were unlaced
conveying to my mind the vision of a
large white pitcher that would be filled
at the corner shop others brought
their feet down sharply others am-
bled 

  as campbell turned from the regu-
lation furnished-house sideboard bear-
ing a bottle and glasses and cigars
which he deposited upon the table i
was going to say something about feet
but instead i pulled the check he had
given me from my pocket and laid it
down before him

   that i said deliberately  has
got to have a proper explanation be-
fore i will have anything to do with it
you have been very liberal with just
enough information to make me un-
comfortable and i object to being
smith even for fifty thousand dollars
a lot of good the fifty would do me if
that chap beans sent me out 

  campbell made up two high-balls-
so he called them-and slid the cigars
nearer to me the check he ignored
completely

   chin-chin he said listlessly and
raised his glass

  i nodded and we drank

   its a pity that little political man
interrupted us at the clachan camp-
bell but there are two things ive kept
my hands clear of-machine politics
and murder i dont know which is
worse take up the check its yours
since it is in part payment for your
life

   but man alive-

   its strange ill admit but if youll
look at it this way it wont seem so in-
definite you know what rollins
wants and perhaps you have gathered
that i have no intention of letting him
have it if i had i would not have
got sysonsby to tell you that pretty
little story he did-you remember
 that was your idea 

   i apologize for the hackneyed na-
ture of it in fact i thought it too
raw altogether but you helped us
wonderfully by talking of rollins
without a lead of any sort you were
very easy but do you think that if i
wanted to have you killed id choose
your friends to conspire with

   i suppose not how much of
what youve told me does sysonsby
know  

   nothing he believes it is sim-
ply a trick to bring the two branches
of your family together again-with
a possible romance at the end of it i
want to hire your services for a few
weeks for which i am willing to pay
the amount of the mortgage on the
lodge-

  using rollinss money-what
 no man-no-my money rol-
linss fifty thousand is going into an
up-town bank to make life real to
some one i know and ill make it
worth double that to you if youll as-
sist me get it away from him

  hang it all man you speak as
if i was a chum of bill sikes dont
you realize that the thing is theft
 i never steal campbell said
quietly  i collect debts my boys
are paid a weekly salary and a com-
mission on their collections just like
the collectors for any other charitable
a thieves comedy



organization mine are a little better
paid perhaps because their work is a
little more dangerous

  if i did not employ them they
could employ themselves promiscu-
ously and get into trouble it is in
their blood-a clot on the brain-and
all i do is to direct their endeavors in
a sort of justifiable channel people
who give need never be afraid of get-
ting one of our calling-cards

   but rollins and his kind who play
scrooge from years beginning to
years end are always likely to hear
from us and the louder they squeal
the better we like it and the oftener
we call

   every man owes a certain per-
centage of his income to the man who
has less-and we simply collect what
the fortunate owes the unfortunate-
and wont pay since the debtor in
this case happens to be rollins i in-
tend to collect even if the cost of col-
lection is double the debt the price
is your affair

  it was a quaint argument of the sort
that would readily command sympa-
thy particularly among the  unfor-
tunate who are appallingly in the
majority i did not argue the point
but asked after a short pause

   how am i to help if i dont know
what i am to do and what reason
have you to suppose that i wont cash
this check and go off somewhere in
the night i could very easily you
know since you cant possibly go to
law about it

   and there you have rollinss po-
sition exactly campbell declared at
once  pie cant make any fuss about
his fifty and any he does make will
be made to me you do not enter into
the matter actively at all

   all you have to do shall be to play
the part of mr mason - campbells
friend - and accept rollinss invita-
tion to go slumming when it comes
ill take care of the rest

   but you dont suppose i would go
into a thing like this without knowing
what is actually going to happen  

   nothing will happen-at least
not to you you will leave the clach-
an as i directed you to-night and
youll do it when a red lights shows in
that signal lamp you saw rollins
wont be with you at the time he
will be at the bar telling crabbe about
smith

   crabbe 

   crabbe - spelled with two  bs 
and an  e he will misunderstand
rollins thoroughly

   and what is going to happen to
rollins

   that does not concern you

   im afraid it does he may be
ail kinds of a rotter but i am hanged
if i will be a party to anything of that
sort

  what sort the question was
very quiet

   you know what i mean

   you have forgotten that i drove
that taxi to-night do you think i
would soil my hands with margarets
fathers blood  

   i suppose not i stammered
campbells eyebrows fell suddenly
and he peered at me from under them
in keen interrogation

   man-but ye have a poor opeenion
o my intelligence if i ever want to
kill a man ill no pit my guilt on the
end o anithers tongue and risk it wag-
gin in states evidence against me
na na man dinna fash yersel aboot
rollins farin weel or ill are ye no
far enough intae an ugly business with-
out wantin tae gang farther 

  i got upon my feet slowly

   yes pm afraid ive gone too far
into a very ugly business your mo-
tives may be excellent and this chap
rollins may deserve a jolly good
hiding but i cant possibly take his
money that way

   oh yes its his  i continued as
he seemed likely to protest  paying
me over your name is only a subter-
fuge - i mean - it doesnt alter the
thing in my eyes a bit of course
everything youve told me is perfectly
safe with me and i have to thank you


the all-story magazine

for one of the most interesting eve-
nings of my life

   in fact i hate like the dickens to
drop out as id like from sheer in-
quisitiveness to know why you began
this sort of thing and how you man-
age to keep out of jail but its quite
impossible for me to-

  the basement bell suddenly inter-
rupted me

  campbell sprang to his feet

   wheest  thats della  he whis-
pered and moved toward the door
leading to the hall

   della  i queried blankly

  he stopped and turned his head

   i beg your pardon-miss borrow-
man-my wife-to be

chapter xiv

della and the gobbler

  he left me standing gaping at the
door and it was then while i awaited
his return that i had my first suspi-
cion that he was not quite right in the
head

  a chap like him marrying-

  the scuffle of feet in the hall inter-
rupted my thoughts and seeing the
check upon the table i seized it and
stuffed it into my pocket in an in-
stant more the door was flung open
and a girl scarcely more than a child
came into the room

  campbell followed her directly

  for a moment the newcomer and i
regarded each other in mute surprise
i havent the least idea of what she
thought of me but there is no question
about what i thought of her

  from under a light silk shawl one
received a hint of the jet-black crown
of her hair that was so wonderful un-
der the lamplight-or any light for
that matter

  her features were small but she was
not so pretty as she was compelling
one looked at her once twice and then
a third time to make sure ones first
impression was correct and each time
one passed lightly over the mouth chin

and nose-all right in their way-to
study the remarkable deep blue of
her eyes and the equally remarkable
inky-black eyebrows that oershadowed
them

  she was prettily clothed in a man-
ner that did not stifle the round lines
of her lithe young figure and gave no
indication of her relationship to the
borrowman tribe - and then in that
moment when i looked for her to smile
in conjunction with the inevitable in-
troduction she turned her head shaq
ly and glanced up into campbells face

   whos this guy  

  the tone harshly imperative and
the final word dissipated everything a
cold shiver ran down my spine

   the gentleman is my friend-mr
mason campbell replied gravely with-
out winking an eyelash and inclined
his head toward me  mr mason
allow me to introduce you to my
fianccc-m i ss borrowman  

  i bowed

   charmed to meet miss borrow-
man ma i offer my congratula-
tions  

  the girls eyes came round upon me
slowly her body did not move just
her head

   youre english aint you 

  judging by her tone my nationality
was a crime but i admitted it

  huh all right if the grega-
rachs satisfied it aint up to me to
lose any sleep about it

  her hand searched for the back of
campbells chair as she sized me up
and when she found it she crept round
it slowly

   im tired mac-played out the
gobbler aint giv me a chanst for a
snooze in forty hours gee - but
kids is the limit when they git goin

  she dropped limply and suddenly
into the chair campbell was at her
side bending over her in a moment
and it did not strike me as being hu-
morous when he got down upon a knee
and took possession of her hands

   poor little girl im sorry its
too much for you isnt it 
a thieves comedy



  his voice softened and his manner
became fatherly

   no it aint too much the girl
answered and in spite of my presence
her head sneaked nearer to his shoul-
der  but i was worried stiff las
night thinkin he was sure goin to
holler hisself into kingdom come afore
mornin i guess he had a pain some-
wheres and as he aint able to say
where he just opens his face and lets
it rip he was sleepin wen i left

   but the nurse-couldnt she-

   i fired her yesday mornin della
interrupted disgustedly and camp-
bells mouth twisted as if he wanted
to laugh but did not dare to  she
didnt- do nothin i couldnt get by
with myself and i guessed you could
use the little fifty a mont some ways
else nessie wouldnt of stood for it
you know she wouldnt shed a
took the gobbler and beat it some-
wheres - and woiked for him - an
shed never have let a man that
aint-

   della   the warning was low
i saw the girl search campbells face
affrightedly his expression was a
little harder

   i forgot della pleaded  i
wussent to say that again - but -
but -her attention was riveted sud-
denly upon me- whats he bangin
aroun for if hes spieled his little
piece why dont he beat it  

  campbell nodded to me and smiled
 mr mason is going to call upon
the gobbler with me-when we take
you home to-night

  he is-eh again i came un-
der the censorship of those great blue
eyes  whats your graft you a
new member  

  campbell laughed softly while i
looked foolish

   mr mason is not a new member
my host answered for me  but he
is almost as anxious to find smith as
we are and will be pleased to meet
the gobbler on that account

   gee 

  della scrutinized me thoroughly

this time as if she were searching for
the cause of my antipathy to smith

   say-if you lamp him first put me
wise will you id do the same for
you

  the eagerness of the question and
the evident genuineness of her offer
kept my face straight and i nodded
the little hard lines about her mouth
softened instantly

   is that on the level 

   on the level i answered and felt
a twinge of conscience since i knew
very well i should never keep my
promise

  smothering a smile campbell
glanced at his watch and rose

   twelve oclock and alls well he
announced sonorously  and now
that there is a bond of understanding
between you we shall cement it with
a glimpse of the gobbler may we be
permitted to spend money on a taxi
miss economy 

  della looked up quickly

   not on your life i didnt fire
that noice sos we could ride roun in
buzz-wagons i jus seen the receip
for the rent yesday an gee i amost
choked the agen handed it to me
by mistake seveny - five bucks a

   all them glad rags me an the
gobblers gotta wear too must ha
stood you up for a pile o rocks evry
time  pipe a hock-shop i gotta hit the
high places to keep from slippin in to

like a walkin meal-ticket for a dozen

   thats all right little girl said
campbell gently  well forego the
extravagance of a taxi and take
the  l 

   already i aint been here a
minute

   and you havent slept for forty
hours campbell reminded her


the all-story magazine

   her long black lashes swept swiftly
upward but as there was no surren-
der in the quiet authority of camp-
bells expression her hand went out
undecidedly to the lowest button on his
coat

   i-i dont care about that now
she said in a very low voice  i aint
seen you but once in a mont an -
an-

   i smiled bowed took the hint and
my hat and went out but i caught
a glimpse of campbells face as i
passed

   he did not look happy

   i waited for them at the outer door
wondering i could not explain it
however and in any case a chap
should never attempt to explain an-
other fellows matrimonial intentions

   of course i guessed who the  gob-
bler  was-the dead borrowman girls
baby-and in those few minutes i was
tempted to fly from the whole thing
but i stayed

   generally speaking inquisitiveness
was probably my principal reason for
doing so and i believed campbells
story the more upon remembering that
rollins had spoken of introducing me
to the slums

   but even with that memory in evi-
dence against him i laughed at the
idea of the little beast wanting to mur-
der me the thing wasnt of the
twentieth century at all

  i thought it would be in perfect
keeping if i ran off with his daughter

   campbell and his fianccc joined me
in a very little while cutting short my
cogitation and on the journey up-
town i studied them both in a careful
way observing that the girl was
watching me closely though she asked
no questions

  that the gregarach had vouched
for me was apparently enough and it
was very evident that she loved him
it showed sometimes when she looked
up into his face and in thev way she
snuggled near to him like a tired child
and held surreptitiously to the great
little finger of his left hand

  i had a suspicion he had lectured her
in the few minutes i had left them
alone she seemed chastened and did
not speak all the way to one hundred
and tenth street

  so long as she kept silent one would
itever have suspected her origin or the
latent savagery that smoldered behind
the childlike simplicity of her face

  we were an odd trio totally dis-
parate in our outlook upon life but in
a pink-and-white bedroom in an ele-
vator apartment - house on cathedral
parkway to which della led us as if
she were ashamed to live there we
came very near to each other mentally
round the crib of the gobbler

  he was a splendid little chap fast
asleep holding on to the neck of his
bottle like grim death while some-
thing like a smile hovered in the cor-
ners of his baby mouth

  i liked the gobbler at once without
a seconds hesitation and for a while
watched him breathe as if it were the
most remarkable thing in the world

  of course i was sorry for him -
poor nameless little chap - and had
rollins come into the room then i
would surely have thrashed him even
at the risk of waking the gobbler

  and as i looked down upon him
nestling so snugly amid the downy
whiteness of his pillows and quite
unconscious of the fact that both
campbell and della were eying me
very closely i had a sudden under-
standing of why i had been brought
to see him

  looking up i found dellas eyes
upon me then campbells

   the fifty thousand i whispered
to the latter  is for-him  

  campbell inclined his head while
della glancing interrogatively at us
both showed plainly that she did not
understand	

  the gobbler stirred and his little
fingers loosening their hold upon the
bottle slid beneath the covers della
bent over him instantly neither touch-
ing him nor making any sound-just
watching
a thieves comedy



  i looked toward campbell again
and found him smiling and obeying
a slight movement of his head tiptoed
after him into the hall and to the liv-
ing-room

   well 

  the monosyllable needed no expla-
nation i pulled the check from my
pocket

   all right-but just for fun you
know you can tear that up and make
out a new one-for the gobbler

  he took the check folded it care-
fully and slipped it into one of the
pockets of that hideous waistcoat of
his

   you must be of the fifth genera-
tion he said with a whimsical smile
and held out his hand

  my fingers tingled with the pressure
of his

chapter xv

losing no time

  curiously enough i slept soundly
that night

  for a little while i turned things
over in my mind wondering where i
would land and then i started up in
response to the appearance of a red
light in the signal-lamp beside the
clachans barroom door-and almost
fell out of bed

  but now that i can view the matter
sanely i marvel at how little it affected
me at the time the element of adven-
ture appealed to me and i think ones
mind can adapt itself quite cheerfully
to almost any condition of affairs

  but i shrank from lunching with
rollins at his club the following day
and when he offered his hand i could
have struck him

  yet i took it remembering where
we were and my promise

  his fingers were like ice and i
thought his eyes were even more shifty
than usual when he talked i expect-
ed him at any moment to declare him-
self but he didnt just then

  i began to notice little things that

  had escaped my attention before and
not one of them made me like him any
better he bullied the waiter in a
sneaking sort of way and smirked and
squinted out of the corners of his eyes
at the people round about

  his conversation driveled and ar-
rived nowhere it bored me insuffer-
ably so that i prayed he would find an
evening suitable for my  demise 
very soon once or twice i almost
suggested one

  it was a considerable relief to get
away from him for the afternoon but
when i reached my hotel more trouble
awaited me in the form of a small
package accompanied by a note liter-
ally  just a line

    please make as much as you can for
  -us smith  nelson broad street
  will take the commission on a ten-
  point margin	v

                        margaret

  us

  i felt peculiarly soothed pleasantly
conscious that i was no longer alone
in the world and it occurred to me
that i must have been terribly lonely-
yesterday even though i hadnt no-
ticed it particularly

  the jewels gave me a chill mar-
garet must have collected everything
in the line of jewelry that she owned
for me to pawn there were several
rings plain gold and diamond-studded
bracelets pearls and other neck adorn-
ments and a tiara sort of thing

  i had no idea of their worth but i
locked my doors and pulled the shades
and in miserlike gloom contemplated
margarets brilliant toys striving to
believe that it would be quite proper
for me to pawn them

  the effort was not successful yet i
realized that if i did not do as she
asked she would be sure to raise the
dickens and that i could not take ad-
vantage of her tip if i deprived her
by my squeamishness of the chance to
make many thousands of dollars

  i spent a rather miserable sunday
afternoon noting the addresses of sev-
eral  uncles  who might accommo-


the all-story magazine

  date me it being borne upon me that
it would not be advisable to take every-
thing to one shop as the pawnbroker
would be sure to think i had stolen
them

  when rollins called for me that
evening to introduce me to the interior
of a fifth avenue church i had the
stuff nicely arranged and my itinerary
for the following day carefully mapped
out

  i cant tell you anything about that
church and the proper time to see
fifth avenue on sunday as every one
knows is after the morning service
when it vies with solomon and the lily
combined and looks like the pages of
the fashion magazines out for a walk

  my mind sacrilegiously was too
busy elsewhere and half the time i was
studying rollinss piously intent ex-
pression which declared that the ser-
mon for him was a very serious
matter

  as i walked with him to his club
afterward he declared that it was a
pleasant relief in the midst of so much
evidence of the mean and ugly to get
away from it all for an hour and two
and listen to a good man speak of high-
er things

   usually he continued  my
daughter accompanies me every sun-
day morning but she did not feel quite
equal to it to-day in fact while i
was lunching with you she fainted
she is not very strong poor child

   oh im sorry i sympathized
 i hope it is nothing serious

   i hope not rollins declared sha-
king his head dolefully  but a
parents anxiety has no end mason-
no end fortunately my daughters
future is pleasantly assured but i
would like to see her gaining strength
poor little girl she is so fond of me
and she appreciates how much it hurts
me to find her so pale and indifferent
to the lighter side of life

   perhaps i am detaining you i
suggested hopefully as we approached
the entrance to the club  i am sure
you would rather-

   no-no-it isnt as bad as that
you know he assured me hurriedly
 she will very likely be all right in
the morning lets go in and talk for
a while

  we went into the smoking-room-
to a quiet corner of it-and talked-or
at least he did-until i was bored to the
yawning point no one came near us
and i imagined that rollins could find
seclusion almost anywhere there was
something about him apart from his
eyes and his cravats that repelled the
sort of something dogs and babies dont
like in a man

  then as i was on the verge of pro-
posing an adjournment apropos of
nothing at all he said

   we have something in the city
which is rather unique

   yes what is that 

   organized theft didnt you read
of that case in yonkers a few days
ago

  he did not look at me as he spoke
andjny surprise might have been quite
natural

   no what was it  

   the rob roy gang which has
been famous in new york for nearly
two years left its card upon a man
named berman after opening his safe
like a match-box and taking everything
worth while out of it

   is that so rather cheeky-
what  

   cheeky  he exclaimed indignant-
ly  it is more grave than mere im-
pertinence it is a blot upon the city
and a sneer at the police and what they
represent no householder can con-
sider himself safe while those parasites
remain at large ive studied them
and i know them ive gone down
into their filthy dens and looked them
over from head to foot

  he appeared to be very much con-
cerned

   you must have done quite a lot of
slumming i suggested  interest-
ing isnt it  

  i knew that was terribly raw but i
hate to see a man beating about the
a thieves comedy



bush particularly if the thing he is
looking for isnt in the bush at all but
out in the open

   quite he conceded  but filthy
-very filthy i was speaking to a man
i used to meet in hells kitchen-his
name is crabbe-and he told me that
the particularly vile saloon i used to
study types in is still in existence in
that neighborhood and i understand
that this rob roy gang frequents that
quarter

   crabbe said he would possibly be
down there wednesday evening and
that he would vouch for our safety if
you cared to look over the district that
is considered to be quite as debased as
whitechapel

  he stopped there waiting for some
response to the invitation and i felt
a cold shiver run through me i dont
know whether he noticed it or not but
i sidled away from him as if he were
not quite clean then somehow i
caught at a hint of humor in the busi-
ness and for a few moments in sheer
devilment i held my peace watching
him squirm upon the rack of uncer-
tainty while he seemed afraid to look
into my face in case he might find re-
fusal there

   what is this chap-this crabbe 
i asked carefully

   well -a sickly smile and an un-
certain movement of the hand- that
is-to tell the truth id rather not say
but i fancy he knows what a warden
looks like

   that makes him an interesting
person wednesday evening did you
say 

  rollinss face cleared instantly

   yes-wednesday well dine here
and go right down afterward how
will that do 

   i am at your disposal sir

  he smiled signed to a waiter and
ordering  two more was positively
cheerful for the remainder of the
evening the anxieties of fatherhood
seeming to have completely slipped
his memory

  but then it isnt every man who

can arrange two  killings  to come
off on the same day - rand islands
and mine

chapter xvi

at nospims

  i was uncertain on monday morn-
ing whether i was fortunate or un-
fortunate in having the forenoon to
myself

  rollins was unpleasant to have
about one but the idea of bearding
several pawnbrokers in their dens
was still more so plowever i sallied
forth bravely

  out of some five millions of people
probably a dozen knew me yet i dilly-
dallied about the doors of the first
shop fearful that i would be seen and
recognized as i went in and when i
did enter the place i am sure i wore a
hunted look because i felt as if half
the police of the city were after me

  there were a man and a woman
waiting at a pigeonholed window
over which was printed  pledges i
joined them and was scrutinized from
head to foot in one glance that gave
me the impression that i intruded

  the man had thrust a watch and
some other trifles through the pigeon-
hole and was anxiously-hungrily in
fact - watching the clerk examine
them

   fifteen dollars the latter an-
nounced in an inflectionless voice

   eh  

   fifteen dollars

   gee an i need-cant you make
it-

   fifteen dollars

  there was no change in the clerks
tone or expression but that of the
man who owned the things under-
went lightninglike alterations sur-
prise gave way to annoyance annoy-
ance to indecision indecision to a
hang-dog look of resignation plis
shoulders seemed to droop a little his
chin and his knees to sag there wasnt
any life to his mumbled  all right


the all-story magazine

  when he received his check for the
cash payable at the cashiers window
the woman took his place she was a
large-boned capable person-had a
locket with some diamonds in it-and
fixed the clerk with a militant eye as
he examined the stones through his
jewelers glass

   fifty dollars

   huh nothin doin i want
seveny-five them di-minds aint the
stage kind sonny 

  if they were madam i could pos-
sibly loan more than you ask next
please

   youre the fresh guy aint you 
the woman almost screeched her face
going red as a beet  youre a gen-
tleman you are insultin a lady as
aint got no brothers or a husband to
come down an knock your block off
you think cause you gotta piece o
plate-glass protectin your ugly mug
as you can hand out any line o talk
what chanst has a woman in this
town when littile hammerecl-down-

  the clerk pressed a button near at
hand and a buzzer was heard some-
where behind the partition

   next please

  the womans flow of language
ceased she seemed undecided and
the locket still lay where the clerk
pushed it out to her she thrust it
back again slowly no one answered
the buzzer

  fiftys your limit heh

   fifty is our limit madam

   i got seveny-five-

   fifty dollars madam or noth-
ing

  the militant attitude departed and
a sulky one took its place

   gimme fifty

  it is always that way

  i started off with the pendant

   let me have what you can on that
please

  the clerk took it glanced question-
ingly at me and departed

  at once i imagined he was going to
telephone to the police or something
like that a cold perspiration broke

out upon my forehead and i stood
first upon one foot then the other
painting mental pictures of myself be-
ing taken down broadway handcuffed
to a policeman with a mob of small
boys and others trailing behind and
just as i had hit upon a fairly respect-
able lie the fellow appeared again

   we can loan you twelve hundred
on this if you want that much

   thanks a thousand will do

  i thought that was rather clever it
disarmed suspicion at once the pen-
dant vanished a cash-slip and the
ticket took its place

   at the cashiers window sir
just as i had been afraid to come in
 was equally afraid to go out but i
did it and went on to the second place
which was nospims the shop mar-
garet had recommended

  this time i did not hesitate but
rushed the citadel with a determined
businesslike air not giving any one a
chance to know what i was after the
line was a little longer there but i
finally got to the window and tried
two rings and again the clerk depart-
ed and returned

  i got seven hundred and fifty for
the two

  going out i took a squint at my list
of addresses and a yard or two from
the pawn-shop door some one sudden-
ly walked by my side and did not go
away turning my head quickly i en-
countered the deep blue eyes of della
 why-

  she smiled and there was a sort of
admiration in the look she gave me
gee you got a gall

  i raised my hat nervously and in-
stinctively moved further away from
the pawn-shop

   how are you this is an unex-
pected pleasure 

  the girl made no reply to that but
took hold of my arm in the most natu-
ral way-as if she had been engaged
to me for years you know--and we
had gone several yards before i real-
ized that she had assumed complete
charge of me

   you aint no piker she declared
while i was wondering whether i
should ask her how she came to be
there  my dope on englishmen wuz
that they wuz mushy you may look
it but i gotta tip my lid to any guy
what hits nospims wit grafted goods
and gets awtay wit it

  she spoke very quietly and the roar
of broadway muffled it to all but me
with what sort of goods

   aw im wise you cant play no
santa claus wit me i quit bein
fooled afore my stockin wuz big
nough to hold anythin i aint asked
you where you grabbed it have i 
grabbed- goodheavens  you
dont suppose i-

  i stopped dellas eyes and mine
met for a moment or two

   can that she said quietly at last
 did you soak nospims wit the
bunch or is that hunk o somethin
whats bumpin my fifth rib some
more  

  she was clinging very tightly to my
arm and the case containing the neck-
lace was in my coat-pocket on that
side but her deduction flabbergasted
me

   youre the rawest i ever seen
she informed me before i could frame
a reply to her question  mebbe thats
how you get by you dont look as if
youd have noive nough to stick up a
guy wit gout in both feet but i
guess you were wise nough to go slow
wit nospims what you got lef
it was plain that argument was use-
less and broadway was no place for
a discussion of that sort and since i
could not explain why i had been to
nospims i had to suffer in silence

   you were shopping i suppose 
i asked in an effort to change the sub-
ject

  della studied me again this time
with a trace of hostility

   sure - i wuz shoppin she
agreed  i wuz down at a hardware
store buyin dumb-bells for the gob-
bler but if you don mind well strike
the  sub  somewheres an beat it up-

    	s

town i aint got all mornin to see
the sights wit you thoity-thoids
nearest

   but miss borrowman i-

   cut out the molasses were goin
to a safe place got me 

   we are what 

   youve got it she said dryly and
plunged me into the maelstrom of
traffic at thirty-fourth street so sud-
denly that there was nothing for it
but to go on to prevent us both from
being killed

  reaching the opposite curb alive i
made bold to ask

   do you mind telling me where you
are taking me to  

   hold your horses an youll see
she replied and took a still firmer grip
of my arm

  for a little while i  held my
horses and we walked up thirty-
fourth street at a fair pace

  there was as before no fault to
find with dellas clothes she was the
target for many eyes and i suppose
some of the men envied me

  nearing fifth avenue i asked as
mildly as possible

  you saw me go into nospims
 sure i seen you whatd you
think i was there for	

chapter xvii

thu safe peace

  a shaft of light penetrated the
darkness instantly

   you mean that mac- i began

   gee but youre the little wise-
heimer  della interrupted and treat-
ed me to a look of wonderful scorn
 its got through has it

  i admitted that it had partly

   he guessed you wouldnt have
the noive to rush nospims she ex-
plained answering the puzzled expres-
sion i wore  said as id most likely
find you bangin roun outside tryin
to look as you were bein stood up by
your wife

   but you put one over on mac that


the all-story magazine

time an on me too you don
look the part buh-lieve me

  i floundered about mentally for a
bit then inquired with some hesita-
tion 

   he didnt tell you where i-got
it 

   didnt tell me nothin cep youd
strike nospims roun ten an i wuz
jus gettin mad wen you blew aroun
the corner

   oh i see then i owe you an
apology for keeping you waiting
really he ought to be more explicit
with his instructions

  he should eh della bristled
instantly  i guess mac don need to
take no tips from you you wuz tol
to make nospims at ten wuzzent
you  

   er - eh - yes -- something like
that i had to admit

   well aint that nough for any
guy what can tell the time 

  the remainder of the way to the
subway was covered in silence and we
traveled to one hundred and twenty-
fifth street in much the same frame
of mind

  clearly so far as della was con-
cerned  macs  methods were above
reproach and she regarded my casual
criticism in the light of an imperti-
nence not readily to be condoned

  i felt properly squelched when we
reached the doors of the  safe place
which was not a hundred miles from
harlems broadway and which sur-
prised me very much in that it was just
like any other pawn-shop and much
better in general appearance than
most

  i read the sign in amazement

 the harlem loan co

 robert mack	proprietor

  with my hand on the door-knob 
queried in a low tone

  this is-his 

   search me della returned enig-
matically and added  i dont need
to go in jus plant the stuff grab the
coin and beat it the- won ask no
questions

  i entered gingerly and finding no
other customer in the place ap-
proached the pledge-window at once

  a young man brisk and business-
like appeared there was nothing
about him to distinguish him from any
of the host of new yorks young men
who make an eighteen - dollar ready-
made suit look worth fifty

   what can i do for you sir 
tone and manner quite respectful
nothing in his face to indicate the
things i thought

   i have some things here-rather
valuable you know-that i should like
to raise a loan on i believe you can
accommodate me  

   certainly let me have the arti-
cles and i will appraise their value and
loan you what i can on them

  the necklace the bracelets two
more rings and the tiara passed
through the pigeonhole in succession
and the clerk vanished as the others
had done to return in a little while
with the question

   i suppose you wish to borrow
upon those to the limit 

   yes-might as well ill be back
for them on thursday i fancy

  i thought i saw his lips twitch but
the smile got no farther than that

 four thousand dollars he intima-
ted quietly  how will you take it 
i told him and he paid it out to me
very carefully as i put it away in my
pocketbook i looked for the ticket

 dont i get some sort of receipt 
 not on-large quantities he re-
plied without the shadow of a smile
 ill know you when you come back
 you have my name on the things
i hope  

   yes-mr mason

  that was conclusive my name
until that moment had not been men-
tioned
a thieves comedy



  as i moved toward the door it was
pushed open and the head and shoul-
ders of a policeman appeared i
stopped short and felt a chilly numb-
ness seize me

   say jimmie that clock you gots
on the blink its dropped four min-
utes since yesday

   tell it to the telegraph company
jimmie retorted easily  hows the
lady  

   gettin on fine that doctors all
right the wife aint scared o him
neither she asted me to say as she
was grateful to mack for sendin him
up where is mack i aint seen him
in a mont o sundays

   he gets round every day for an
hour or two jimmie answered
 hell be glad to hear about your
wife dont block up the doorway

   excuse me the policeman apolo-
gized opening the door wider for me
to pass out  slong jimmie ill
tell the blonde at the soda fountain
you was askin for her

  jimmie encouraged the officer to do
so and i made my exit in the latters
wake trying to appreciate all the orig-
inality in the idea of a thief playing
 fence  to himself i was not at all
clear upon the efficacy or profit-real-
izing power of the arrangement but
contented myself with the conclusions
that doubtless campbell knew what
he was about

  i looked around for della

  she had gone

  that evening found me at the van
huysenss we were a smaller party
than before campbell was not there
he was understood to be out of town
and rollins with the weight of pater-
nal cares upon his tongue intimated
that margaret was  not at all well
and that it would probably be several
days before she could venture out with
safety

  i glanced across at alice as he spoke
and found her studiously looking the
other way later i think she proposed
some music simply because it took her

out of the drawing-room because i
thought so i deliberately took my stand
beside the piano turning the music for
her and evidently surprising her by
performing the duty at the right time

   you know music mr-mason
she asked gathering courage while
she searched for a second piece

   enough to know the notes go up
and down i answered squinting
through the parted portieres into the
drawing-room where my hostess rol-
lins and ralph were engaged in an
apparently earnest conversation  mr
campbell plays and sings rather well
dont you think 

   i suppose so

  very dryly as if she were too little
interested in the gentleman to bother
about anything he did

   we have heard him so often im
afraid weve neglected to appreciate
his talents you are enjoying your
visit i hope

   very much thanks so far it has
been very interesting

  her face was turned away but in
pretense of looking more closely at the
piece of music she had selected i
leaned a little nearer to her

   do you mind telling me if you
know anything of your butlers ante-
cedents  

  her head came round quickly at the
question

   why do you ask 

   because ive seen him before some-
where and im afraid he has a better
memory than i have

  contrary to my expectations alice
showed no trace of alarm she simply
smiled

   that might be awkward she
said and placed the second offering on
the music-rest  but there isnt much
danger randor is a friend of mine

   her fingers ran lightly over the
keys

   randor  i repeated  that
sounds familiar

   does it you used to- play cricket
quite a lot didnt you 

  cricket jove just a second


the all-story magazine

yorkshire-no wor--no it wasnt
there either maryle-thats it m
c c randor used to run things at
the m c c clubhouse how did you
think id remember that way  

   because the marylebone cricket
clubs recommendation is i think
randors only conceit turn the page
please

   sorry better play a little louder
hadnt you you dont think randor
would give me away then 

   he would be sure to tell me first if
he did

   really youre sure of that 

   quite here is uncle theodore
coming to find out what we are talking
about hes been terribly suspicious
lately

  her eyes did not stray from the
music or her fingers miss a note but
rollins was at my side a few moments
later asking me what was my favorite
selection he clung to me every mo-
ment for the remainder of the evening

in his car on the way home sudden-
ly assuming a confidential air he
asked with a poor show of hesitation
 you were rather-impressed-by
my niece  

  i tried not to show my surprise at
the interrogation

   i must confess i was why 
oh nothing no importance
really she has a very engaging per-
sonalitv-what 

   i think so

  rollins laughed in an unpleasant
fashion

   you know mason ive seen men
lean upon that piano before while she
played

   doubtless that does not surprise
me

   and theyve all more or less
taken to-poetry

   sorry i must prove the rule i
couldnt write a line if i tried

   thats good he commended and
the sneer that followed was not thick-
ly clothed  because so far all the
effusions have gone into the fire-in-
cluding campbells

  he actually took pleasure in telling
me a thing like that

  rollins was a mean little rat

chapter xviii

 from the visitors gallery

  approximately my partner and i
were worth ten thousand five hundred
dollars and on tuesday morning
rand island was quoted at 

  before lunch i had sufficient intelli-
gence to slip down-town and finding
as margaret had said that smith 
nelson broad street would accept
ten thousand dollars of united states
currency and do business with me on
a ten-per-cent margin i managed to
eat with rollins at half past twelve
with a piece of paper in my pocketbook
stating that one thousand shares of
rand island had been bought for my
account at 

  i had given no selling orders

  thinking it would be rather nice to
make enough to clear the mortgage on
the lodge-with rollins at my elbow--
i told him in a casual way that i should
like to see wall street in action

   why of course he agreed at
once  peculiar how a man belittles
what has become common to him i
never thought of it if i am not mis-
taken there will possibly be a little
fun on the floor to-morrow and if
you like ill give you a glimpse of the
exchange from the visitors gallery i
may be rather busy but there is usu-
ally enough happening on the floor to
keep a stranger interested

  and as we rode down into the canon-
like financial district on wednesday
morning with the newspapers quoting
rand island at  i found the situa-
tion at least three thousand dollars
funnier than it had been the day be-
fore

  from the gallery of the new york
stoek exchange one can look down
upon men who probably represent
more money than any other group in 
the world
a thieves comedy



 but they dont like that in the least

  i thought they were brokers clerks
at first until rollins who had piloted
me past the doorkeeper told me that
every man on the floor was a member
and with his chest out added that the
cheapest  seat  had sold for forty-
eight thousand dollars while the ma-
jority had cost twice as much

  there was nothing particularly
 large  in the atmosphere the big-
gest things about the place being the
great  blackboards  set into the right
and left walls which signal to mem-
bers by electrically displaying their
seat numbers that they are wanted at
the telephone

  the floor was strewn with papers-
square-cut slips mostly-and sprinkled
generously with water to keep down
the dust boys in blue-gray uniforms
scurried hither and thither without
any apparent objective while members
either lounged about the several posts
answered calls or threw things -
words peanuts and paper pellets-at
one another

  some one beneath the gallery was
courting laryngitis shouting some-
thing or other at  thirty-eight thou-
sand

  there were half a dozen men stand-
ing within six inches of him paying
not the slightest heed and he finally
ceased yelping chucked a handful of
white square-cut slips at no head in
particular and strolled aimlessly up
the floor with his hands deep in his
pockets not seeming to care a rap
whether any one took any interest in
his  thirty-eight thousand  or not

   those are the bond men rollins
informed me referring to the gentle-
men under the gallery  bonds are
very slow just now but i think if
you wait a little while and watch post
no  there will be a stir of some sort
when you get tired take a stroll down
to the curb-market ill meet you down-
stairs about one

  as he went out i wondered if he
were going to appear on the floor per-
sonally but almost before he had

turned the corner toward the lift i
heard a staccato voice call

   ninety-five for any part of ten
thousand rand island  

  turning my head i found that men
all over the floor were directing their
attentions toward post no  which
had suddenly awakened into a sem-
blance of activity with a big broad-
faced man in the center of it looking
about him heavily from under deep
black bushy eyebrows

   ninety-five for any part of ten
thousand  he cried again and the
buzz of comment grew louder

  there were no sellers some of the
members round him grinned and he
studied them with something akin to
disgust until a little man with a black
straggling beard squeezed his way into
their midst and piped in a squeaky
voice

    par for ten thousand 

  he did not get up on the seat and
he was almost too small to be seen
among the crowd that was quickly con-
verging toward post no-  the big
man looked down upon him and amid
an excited hum could be heard to say
quite plainly

   id like to call your bluff secken-
dorf but whats the use one hun-
dred and five for any part of ten thou-
sand  

  the bid came from him with the
sharpness of a challenge and i knew
the game had begun

  turning and elbowing his way out
of the crowd the little man scurried
away his challenger laughed said
something i did not catch and after
a few minutes wait bid no for five
thousand

   still  sellers

  considering the jumps the stock was
taking a strange lack of excitement
marked the attitude of the majority of
the members on the floor most of
them looked sullen some stood aloof
and watched the others crowded about
the big man with an eye upon the tele-
phone signal-boards rushing off when
their numbers appeared and rushing


the all-story magazine

back again to find rand island a point
or two higher than when they left
post no 

  the big man i presumed was rol-
linss friend rollins did not appear

  some one sold a thousand shares at
 and a moment later a quiet-voiced
white-haired gentleman made himself
suddenly prominent by bidding  for
any part of twenty thousand the
big man snorted glared at the new-
comer and carried the  fight  ten
points higher

  perhaps a number were fooled into
believing that it was a real fight i
knew better and gave the big man
credit for being an actor of no mean
ability

  his expression of surprise when
competed with was splendid one
would almost believe he was surprised
quite as if his competitors were not
acting under orders from rollins who
i presumed was pulling the wires upon
the outside

  there wasnt apparently a share of
the stock in sight at least there was
none for sale at  i began to count
my winnings at that figure when it al-
tered to  with the assistance of a
squat square-jawed man who did not
leave until he had forced the big man
to bid  for any part of twenty-five
thousand

  in spite of the ninety-point rise it
was as if the fun were only beginning
there was plenty of noise of course
men screeching at the pitch of their
voices rushing across the floor toward
the telephones and back again and out
into the street some of them white
and frantic-eyed most of them making
great use of their arms with the big
mans staccato voice sounding above
it all

  but there did not seem to be the
fuss that adequately represented the
eighty-eight thousand my partner and
i had made within half an hour

  i had expected a sort of riot but
there was nothing like that far from it
and i wondered what sort of a rise
would be necessary to create one

  i did not get in the least excited
the stock was sure to go up to 
and so long as the big man was con-
fident i had nothing to worry about
he could as he had said carry it to
 if he liked

  there wasnt a sign of weakness
and i stood fascinated watching it
climb ten points each jump till it
reached 

  the very little mart with the strag-
gling black beard came back and
squeaked it up to that figure his
shrill piping voice made me nervous
and there were many members on the
floor who felt just as i did wanted to
yell but couldnt

  one or two became rather hysterical
in their manner most of them talked
very fast and seemed to run around in
circles as if they did not know what
to do with themselves

  riot had almost come

  one cannot describe that noise
some of it came from the street it
isnt a bit like the roar of a baseball
crowd because that is a volume of
sound in which thirty to forty thou-
sand throats create in unison

  the other business was a yell and
a groan and a whisper and a low re-
verberant murmuring and the scuffle
of many feet all jumbled up together
in one horrible inharmonious whole
that began and ended nowhere

  i decided i would sell at  feeling
that i would probably lose the benefit
of a further fifty-point rise by doing
so and i had barely made the decision
when the big mans staccato voice
drowned the little mans squeak and
his bid 

   two hundred and thirty-five for
any part of twenty thousand 

  something like a groan went up i
edged toward the gallery exit still
leaning over the rail almost hypnotized
by the seething confusion of sound and
action below

   two hundred and forty for twenty-
five thousand  some one called quiet-
ly and i stopped to see who it was

  the white-haired gentleman looked
a thieves comedy



tip at rollinss friend who jerked his
head round and seemed to hesitate
then he grinned-his lips curling back
from his teeth

   two hundred and fifty for fifty
thousand he bellowed and there
followed a moments awful hush

   sold the lot 

  the answer came from underneath
the gallery-a thunderbolt that wiped
the smile from the big mans lips in a
twinkling

  every eye turned toward a tall dark
member of the exchange who emerged
from obscurity and approached rol-
linss friend with a terrible calm

  the latter went white-then gray
leaning far over the rail gaping at
him foolishly i saw his lips twitch and
his glance go fearfully about him

  fifty thousand sold at 

  and there were not five thousand
shares of rand island out of rollinss
hands within five hundred miles of
new york at that moment

  i couldnt move my knees felt
wabbly and my mind struggled vainly
through a fog dark shapes of men
raced about below screeching at one
another-pandemonium

  what happened in the succeeding
few minutes was simply a jumble of
incoherent things i did not understand
but i waited to - see what the result
would be

  i could see rollinss friend looking
about him dazedly as if the shock had
numbed his faculties quite as much as
mine and then out of the flurry and
above the tumult a clarion voice asked 

   want twenty-five thousand more
at the price bailey 

  rollinss friend threw his head back
as if avoiding a blow and swung upon
his tormentor like a wildcat

   you heard me buy fifty thousand
he snarled

  i avas far far at sea something
was all wrong somewhere the  cor-
ner  was a fizzle and my head felt
rather light as i groped my way toward
the exit praying that i might reach a
telephone before the crash came

  even the door was too far

   all right the twenty-five thousand
man shouted amicably before i had
gone three steps  here goes ten
thousand at  

  it was like a straight right between
the eyes an uppercut delivered by a
 little  fellow anxious to unload fol-
lowed it a second later

   five hundred at   

  just a moments pause-then

   a thousand at  

  i reached the door and took one look
backward rollinss friend was totter-
ing across the floor toward the tele-
phones

  riot had come

   ten thousand at  

  fifteen hundred at  

  a thousand at 
twenty-five thousand at par
my throat clogged up and there
was a sort of mist before my eyes

  i dont know what the doorkeeper
thought of me but i staggered toward
the elevator like a drunken man feel-
ing that i had been betrayed

chapter xix

just an accident

  when i reached the street i did
not stop to study the crowd or the
seething torment of the curb-market
half a square further down but raced
madly to smith  nelsons office

  there was a mob of fanatics there
too crowding about the ticker while
some one in a deadly monotone read
off the returns and another worn-out-
looking chap chalked them on a black-
board fof all the world to see

  i had just buttonholed some one
whom i thought i recognized as an
employee and was gulping out an
order to sell when that lifeless voice
chanted 

   rand island----

  it went lower than that - twenty-
five points lower-almost quicker than
the chap at the blackboard could write
it down


the all-story magazine

  my hand fell away from the lapel
of the other mans coat and i stared
stupidly into his face for a moment or
two

   sorry old chap cant cover im
wiped out

  whether lie heard me or not amid
that babel of tongues i do not know
he didnt say anything just nodded
and turned away

  i found the street again

  everything was blurred and i felt
a little sick-light-headed you know
faces swept past me in an incessant
stream some white and drawn and
fearful some cadaverous and sneak-
ing  others merely curious and some
that laughed

  jostled upon right and left deaf-
ened by the roar of the curb-market i
wanted to get away from it-as far
away as possible

  somehow or other i came to bat-
tery park

  a vacant seat beckoned me and i
watched in a dull sort of way the peo-
ple go in and out of the aquarium
followed the movements of the tugs
and lighters and ferries on the river
and saw a liverpool boat sweep out
past governors island leaving a trail
of black smoke behind her

  i didnt care a rap about my forty-
five hundred my responsibility for
margarets share dwarfed that

  if i had only sold at two hundred

  ahead was the blank wall of fail-
ure a pitilessly thick and high ar-
rangement of facts that did not even
take the trouble to explain themselves
and behind that wall-in an apartment
up-town-a girl was waiting for re-
lease from a lie and to hear that i had
won

  something stuck in my throat and
the things round about me became un-
certain margaret seemed to go a long
way off step by step toward the mar-
riage that was so hateful to her-
looking back in pitiful appeal

  a strange heaviness descended upon
me i felt as if i had intruded a few
yards into a sort of paradise and been

suddenly and rudely chucked out into
the gutter of the world

  i was sorry there would be no elope-
ment with a christmassy effect-and
i wanted to tell her so was even sel-
fish enough to want to tell her that if
the lack of money made no difference
to her it made none to me i could
work and earn-

  there i stopped with a jerk and
came to my senses as if a pail of cold
water had been thrown over me

  id have to work of course but it
would be bad enough for one to live
on what i could earn two would prob-
ably starve

  fortunately i told myself in a fee-
ble effort to find one little ray of sun-
shine campbells harlem loan com-
pany had the bulk of the jewelry and
when i thought of that i wondered if
he had been caught in the avalanche
whether he had or not i felt i could
prevail upon him to give margaret
back her toys and allow me to owe
him four thousand even though i
hadnt the faintest idea when i would
be able to discount the debt

  unquestionably the responsibility
was mine i had been too confident
and too greedy had placed too much
reliance upon rollins and his friend
that they had blundered with me was
the only bit of satisfaction i had be-
tween them however they divided it
that purchase of  fifty thousand at
two hundred and fifty  meant a loss
of ten million

  i thought i would like to see how
rollins took a smash like that and
glancing at my watch saw that it was
quarter of one

  but i was denied the privilege just
then a messenger accosted me when
i arrived at the exchange entrance and
delivered a note from rollins saying
that he  regretted very much that the
urgent nature of his business et
cctcra but he hoped to meet me at
dinner that evening as arranged

  the financial district was in the
hands of the police who were trying
to regulate a noonday crowd swelled
a thieves comedy



to most unusual proportions by ru-
mors of a panic as a matter of fact
rand island stock was not important
enough to effect the general market
and only in that wild hour of its rise
and fall did it excite the exchange to a
frenzy that had almost died away in
my short absence from the  street
growing tired of watching the fu-
tile mob and finding no relief in the
antics of the curb-brokers i sought a
restaurant and lunched alone

  groups of men brokers all seated
about the round tables talked in whis-
pers as if they were afraid that the
other groups would hear what they
said the atmosphere of the place
was mysterious and volcanic it got
on my nerves and i couldnt eat

  i think i forgot to tip the waiter i
know i did forget to drop my ticket
in the chopper of the subway and the
colored gentleman on guard called me
back loudly and insinuatingly

  a local train carried me to fifty-
ninth street and i wandered aimless-
ly up central park west wondering
how on earth i could communicate
with margaret at once

  an irresistible desire to see her and
explain had led me up-town and i
thought that if she could send mes-
sages to me when rollins was out
there could be no danger if  were to
send one to her

  first however i thought id try the
telephone it would be perfectly
proper to inquire if miss rollins were
improving doubtless i could learn
from the reply how the land lay

  finding a private booth and learn-
ing rollinss telephone number from
the telephone-book i secured the con-
nection and was answered by a rather
pleasant-voiced female who the mo-
ment i said  hello  asked hurriedly
-even roughly

  this is mr van huvsen isnt it 
for one second i hesitated-and i
did not wish to give my own name

   yes i tried to imitate ralphs
somewhat high-pitched tones  who
is speaking please 

  a low laugh came along the wire
quite clearly

   is my voice so very different on
the telephone id recognize yours
ten thousand miles away

  i was glad of that but i did not say
so the voice at the other end of the
wire was not margarets

  how is miss rollins much bet-
ter i hope  

   oh much  came the answer
with a hint of ridicule in it  shes
convalescing in the park somewhere
with your sister so you neednt be
afraid to talk to me i am at the
library phone with the door closed
and ive been praying all day that
youd call when she was out

  i almost dropped the receiver

   wheres everybody   i asked
carefully

   the japs flirting with gretchen
and the cooks gone out for a dill
pickle or something theres nobody
bothering about me or what im doing
is it all right for to-morrow night
without realizing it i was startled
out of my  part

   yes i suppose so

   whats the matter   came the
query sharply and the tone became
harsh  aint you feeling good  
not very - and the phone you
know-rather dangerous-what  
say wtios that talking now
you aint - that aint ralphs voice
who are you  who-my gawd  

  it was only a whisper that trailed
away into a horrified silence

  i hung up the receiver and went to
look for margaret in the park

chapter xx

the benches in the park

  had i met ralph van huysen then
i would possibly have been foolish
enough to discuss the matter with him
in terms more forcible than polite

  though it was really  business of
mine i was very much annoyed about
it in fact went so far as to vow that


the all-story magazine

whether i could afford it or not ralph
should not marry his cousin

  i suppose that was rather puerile
but as  stationed myself at the park
entrance nearest to the rollins apart-
ment feeling sure that alice and mar-
garet would come out that way i did
not become any the less decided about
the affair

  after half an hour or so watching
the leaves fall studying the afternoon
loiterers and scanning the sparsely
populated walks became very monot-
onous and in desperation i decided to
penetrate further

  scarcely a hundred yards round a
curve was enough and when i caught
sight of them the cousins were rising
from a seat to walk off the other way

  when i came up with them i was a
little out of breath

   good afternoon

  they halted abruptly and reviewed
me in blank amazement i was glad
the path was a quiet one

  the blood raced into margarets
cheeks and forehead and throat and
then retreated instantly leaving her
deathly pale for a fleeting second her
eyes met mine and my knees shook

  i stood within the gates once more
struggling to be calm gazing at the
slim figure of a girl in a little gray hat
and a gray dress and trembled because
she was so near

  in a moment the heaviness descend-
ed again the truth stalked up to me
and pitched me out i knew it was go-
ing to be very hard to speak through
the bars to her and tell her why

  alice whose clothes harmonized so
perfectly in a quiet unobtrusive way
that one never noticed particularly
what she wore found her tongue first
and her control over her emotions has
many times since then been a source of
wonder to me

   good afternoon mr mason she
greeted me with just the faintest hint
of hostility in her tone  we were
just speculating upon whether you
would come out of wall street a lion
or a lamb

   then-you havent heard-

   nothing she interrupted lazily
some of the color had come back
into margarets cheeks though she
continued to find it difficult to take her
attention away from the little gold
mesh-bag chain which she was wind-
ing around her fingers

   lets walk i suggested and de-
termined to be as indifferent as possi-
ble under the keen surveillance of
alices eyes  some one in the rol-
iiins establishment informed me you
were in the park i telephoned

  a little hand on my right clutched
my sleeve nervouslv

   you telephoned  

  fear reigned in tone and look but
the moment i turned my head and
glanced downward margaret became
busy with the mesh-bag again in the
taxicab without alice to play censor
i suppose it had been different but i
hardly think in any case that she was
as much afraid of me in the park as i
was of her

   i didnt give my name i assured
her  miss van huysen evidently
knows of our partnership

  margaret did not answer i think
she tried to but couldnt find her
tongue

   i think so alice replied for her
 and judging by your expression
what i predicted has happened

   you predicted 

    it hasnt 

  the interruption filled with defi-
ance was margarets and she looked
suddenly up to me for support i
quailed before that appeal and my
tongue became very thick and unwield-
ly seeming to clog my throat

   im sorry-but im afraid-that
is-were-wiped out 

   wiped-out 

  i hardly think alice heard it but she
turned her head away it was just a
breath and the bright red of mar-
garets lips faded to an anemic pink as
she caught my arm again-not in dis-
appointment but in fear

  for a while no one said anything
a thieves comedy



  i felt like a brute-and then i want-
ed to tell her not to bother about it-
that it was all right-id look after
her but i could not fool myself that
way

  so i thought of the harlem loan
company again

  you are sure margaret whis-
pered at last just as i was going to say
that id get the things back for her
 i-thought papa had everything-
 yes-i thought so too until some
one unearthed fifty thousand shares
from somewhere and sold them to
your father at two hundred and fifty
but i should have sold at two hundred
i was greedy and waited thinking we
were quite safe-and the bottom
dropped out of things in five minutes
you mustnt worry about it though
i am sure i can get those things you
sent me-

  you wont it is i who should
give you-

   you mustnt say that it was my
fault entirely i was just aching to
plunge and-

   but you wouldnt have plunged if
i hadnt told you of rand island and
youve lost everything 

   dont quarrel children alice in-
terrupted smoothly in a superior
motherly tone and laughed in a man-
ner i thought rather heartless  you
havent time and besides this is cen-
tral park i thought boys on roller-
skates were not allowed in here

  a little chap seated on his skates
whizzed past us down the quiet path

   you said that some one sold uncle
theodore fifty thousand at two hun-
dred and fifty  alice queried some-
what absently

   exactly i answered trying to
understand her attitude

   um thats about five times what
the stock is worth isnt it i should
imagine uncle theodore wont feel a
bit happy about that when he learns
as he is sure to do that his daughter
has lost every piece of jewelry she
owned in a fiasco he will be positively
unfit to live with

   alice  the protest was mar-
garets

   well -airily- whats the use
of smothering the truth it is mighty
and will insist upon prevailing so you
might as well turn your innocent little
face toward it and see what it looks
like

  i tried to smile and to say some-
thing but managed neither margaret
seemed equally at a loss for a moment
or two then she said very quietly

   im not afraid

   that is foolish i declared  ill
have those things back to you-

   who is going to lend you five to
six thousand dollars without collat-
eral mr mason   alice broke in
most irritatingly calm  and even if
you should find some one dont you
think that thats rather a cheap and
easy way out  

  no mercy in that girl whatsoever
 but-great iiea-guns  miss van
huysen we cant-

  cant you then it is just as
well you did not win if you had you
would both have made the mistake of
your lives and been wretched forever
and ever so lets say  amen  to
that

  we wont margaret objected
strenuously and i felt as if i would
like to applaud   wouldnt take the
old things back if he brought them to
me ill draw every penny ive got
and-and-

  how much is that alice asked
 almost nine hundred dollars
papa doesnt let me have more than a
thousand at a time

   nine hundred alice repeated
would i be very rude if i inquired
whether mr mason could made it-a
thousand 

   i think i could do that

  alice smiled

   well you cant do anything to-
day since the banks are closed but
lots of people have run away on much
less than a thousand dollars

   i read of the case of a man who
tried it with seventy-five cents to-


the all-story magazine

clay i believe he is a prosperous cigar
manufacturer with a son at yale and
the rest of the family preparing for
bryn mawr i dont suppose you
could make cigars mr mason

   i never tried to let-lets find a
seat and talk this over

  alice glanced cjuickly up at me and
away again margarets fingers
gripped my arm tighter and tighter

  perhaps it was alices taunts or
margarets courage in her helpless-
ness or the vow i had vowed or a
combination of all three that made me
feel so very determined and serious
much more serious than i allowed
them to believe i was in any case
when we found a vacant seat  was in
no mood for quibbling

   now lets see i began the mo-
ment we were seated us and com-
pany have just lost ten thousand dol-
lars since its no use crying over
spilled milk we might as well face the
music and decide here and now
whether us and company shall be dis-
solved or not

   i have saved about five hundred
from the wreck and my partner is
rich to the tune of nine hundred to-
tal assets in hard cash about fourteen
hundred now i think i can drive
and take care of a car well enough to
earn- what do they pay chauffeurs
over here 

  margarets fingers slipped down to
my hand and held on like grim death
they trusted me i could feel that

  alice laughed softly and looked
away for a moment

   twenty-five dollars i think is a
fair average she said at last in a low
tone and her clear gray eyes came
round again quite steadily  but of
course youre joking

  i accepted the information and ig-
nored the question

   do you mean twenty-five per
week or month  

   week of course

  not so bad is it i looked to
margaret for a comment of some sort
and found her regarding me in mute

astonishment  could we live on
twenty-five per week  

   oh please - please dont make
fun 

  fun i never was more serious
you are my responsibility now and
im not a bit afraid to undertake it
do you think you could marry me--
to-morrow  

  good heavens alice whispered
involuntarily and  margarets eyes
widened and widened till i thought
they would never stop

   of course i know this isnt a bit
orthodox youre not getting half
the fun out of it you ought to get but
its original probably well make as
good a shape at matrimony as lots of
people i lyiow who tackled it with all
the usual frills

   in the presence of a witness i
haven t the least hesitancy in saying
that i like you very much and that
though a week ago i hadnt any in-
tention of marrying any one you have
removed my prejudices entirely and
you know you said a few minutes ago
that you were not afraid

   im not 

   then perhaps miss van huysen
will inform me where we could secure
a license and that sort of thing

  alice drew a sharp breath and
blinked as i turned my head all the
starch seemed to have been taken out
of her but in a minute she was smiling
and looking almost happy

   hoboken seems to be the logical
aid to madness of this sort she said
calmly  the city hall isnt more than
a few steps from the ferry and i be-
lieve the way is lined with justices of
the peace

   a sort of gretna green  that
should do very well would you care
to come along and witness the execu-
tion  

   no thanks very firmly

  margaret moved uneasily but said
nothing

 really you wont come i
asked again

   no but if you are really in
a thieves comedy



earnest about this ill accompany
margaret to the ferry-the new york
side-and meet you there after that
i refuse to be responsible for any-
thing

   thank you that will do very
nicely provided of course that my
partner is agreeable

  blushing furiously margaret looked
up for a second and a wan little smile
of acquiescence parted her lips the
fear had gone out of her eyes

  yet alice seemed to envy her in
the succeeding few minutes while
margaret looked as if she would like
to run off somewhere and cry or dance

-	i was not sure which - alice be-
came quieter and quieter trifling ab-
sently with a locket and once or twice
i thought her lip quivered

  when i left them telling alice that
i should expect her to recommend me
to any one who needed a chauffeur
she smiled and said

   whats the use you wouldnt
stay a week

chapter xxi

tiiu start

  thu evening papers telling me
again of our losses failed to hurt as
they might have done had that meet-
ing in the park not taken place

  apparently the fifty thousand shares
sold at two hundred and fifty were by
no means mythical they had ar-
rived in new york about midnight on
tuesday by special train from san
francisco

  of the twenty-five thousand that
had smashed the price to smithereens
fifteen thousand had been acquired in
cleveland alone while the balance had
been collected from other western
points

  so far did the brokers who handled
the stock go with their stories and no
farther but it was enough to let me
guess that the large stockholder in san
francisco had learned of the proposed
elevation of rand island and had de-

liberately set about to checkmate rol-
lins and his friend

  rollinss name was not mentioned
in any of the reports bailey the big
man with the staccato voice and with
apparently little or no reputation to
lose got all the publicity and all the
blame so i imagined that rollins was
bearing the brunt of the cash losses of
the combination

  he certainly looked as if he were
at dinner that evening his cheeks
were the color of parchment his
smile like that of a deaths head and
his hand so shaky that he could
scarcely carry the soup-spoon to his
mouth without spilling some of the
contents

  occasionally i saw in his eyes the
black shadow of his heart and then
he was grinning horribly and chatter-
ing on about something far removed
from wall street

  he almost blubbered when he spoke
and most of what he said was an in-
coherent jumble that began in eng-
land and ended in hells kitchen

  of course i was blind to everything
and with the sweets i inquired duti-
fully about his daughters health

  a spoonful of meringue halted in
mid air he looked over it at me as if
he were questioning whether he had
heard aright

   she is much better much better
she was out to-dav in the park beau-
tiful in the park now you know

  there was a light in his eyes i did
not understand something akin to tri-
umphant cruelty

  we took a taxi to ninth avenue
and fifty-ninth street rollins in-
forming me that it would be so much
more interesting if we walked the re-
mainder of the way

  in spite of our having dined at rol-
linss club we were not in evening
clothes eounge suits autumn over-
coats and soft hats did not make us
in the least conspicuous and we came
to the car-barns at the corner of fifty-
fourth street and tenth avenue
without incident
r

	the all-story magazine

  rollins tried to give me the impres-
sion that he was familiar with the
place and failed he played his part
wretchedly

  first lie hoped we were not too
early then he was afraid that perhaps
crabbe might be late further it was
so- long since he had been in that re-
gion he did not suppose any one would
remember him

  looking down fifty-fourth street
toward the river he muttered nerv-
ously 

  horribly dark isnt it

   rather forbidding but if we
stand here much longer those loungers
at the corner will begin to pitch things
at us where is the saloon in which
you used to study types  

   one block farther west thats it
i think-the light at the other end of
the street

   i see the light but are you sure
its the one you are looking for

   oh yes-quite sure i remember
it quite well

  he was not looking toward the
clachans lights which i thought were
unusually bright but furtively about
him and as a tram-motorman crossed
from out of the shadow of the car-barn
wall and walked heavily past us down
fifty-fourth street rollins seemed to
pluck up courage all at once and fol-
lowed him

  the street was very quiet but the
motorman trudging on ahead gave me
a feeling of security rollins became
quieter and quieter every yard he
appeared to have forgotten me

  some one clinging close to the fac-
tory wall skulked past us and a stout
woman came after him then i heard
the tinkle of a piano and all at once
many voices joined in the slaughter
of a popular piece of rag-time

  at first i was doubtful about the
source of the sound and then i real-
ized that it came from the clachan

  and as we drew near enough i saw
that it was gaily decorated with flags
and bunting though there wasnt a
soul to be seen outside its doors

  the motorman led the way to the
place but did not go inside he
plodded on round the corner rollins
gripped my arm as the swing doors
closed behind us

   well go into the back room he
whispered  its more interesting
there

  there were only three customers at
the bar-an italian and two large fair-
haired men who looked like swedes
they took  notice of us and one
would never have believed that andy
the bartender had tried to save me
from batchs razor

  but the back room was quite another
matter

  the tables were arranged so as to
leave a large space in the center of the
floor every light in the place was lit
and almost every table occupied at
each there were at least one or two
young women

  my first impression was that a local
glee club or something of the sort had
hired campbells back room to cele-
brate an  occasion  of their own

  every one was in gala attire there
was no sign of the element i had en-
countered upon my first visit the
men were clean-shaven and neatly
dressed the women were dressed in
the latest imitation of fifth avenue

  in the top corner quite near my exit
stood the piano at which a girl was
seated with her back to me a young
man was gallantly turning the music

  i had heard a harlem policeman call
him  jimmy

  and the pianist was della

chapter xxii
waltzing around with rosie

  she did not turn her head not even
when as we gingerly made our way
through the tobacco-smoke to a vacant
table not far from the piane a womans
voice called shrilly above the ragtime
chorus

   oh you blondy 

  the chorus wavered and several

                           
a thieves comedy



laughed i admit that i am rather fair
della glanced up at jimmy but played
right on

   a seltzer an milk for theirs gar-
song some one called to a waiter
 lump o sugar in it

   say sweetie  howza mama 

   lamp the little guy will ye 
dont he hate hisself  

   aw-can the chatter  

   gwan i jus love a man what can
raise a -tache like blondy room
at your table honeybug 

   aint he the baby-doll 

  evidently in a laudable attempt to
drown the hail of comment for which
i regret to say the ladies were almost
entirely responsible della repeated the
chorus of the thing she was playing
fortissimo and the singing began
again loosely

  leaning idly against the piano jim-
my smiled upon the scene and though
our eyes met he gave no sign of recog-
nition

  rollins palpably nervous sat with
his back to the door principally be-
cause i forced him to by getting to the
other side of the table first sitting
side-on i could watch both the signal-
lightscampbell had designated and the
piano

  one would have thought there were
pins in rollinss chair it was quite
plain that he had never been in a place
like that before he even seemed
afraid of the waiter when that individ-
ual approached and barked 

   whatll ye have  

  rollins ordered brandy and looked
as if he needed it i trusted to camp-
bells proprietorship and took my
 usual

  a generously built straw-haired girl
and a lithe young man swung out into
the center of the floor as della plunged
the piano keys into the throes of the
turkey trot -whether she intended it
or not the dance took a great deal of
attention from us and the first couple
to answer the call was joined quickly
by as many more as the floor space
could uncomfortably accommodate

  the straw - haired girl sneaked my
hat as she pirouetted past our table and
clumped it back on my head the next
time she visited us blowing a kiss to
me as she slid away her partner did
not mind

   aint she fresh  a dark little girl
at the next table queried of her escort
a heavily built beetle-browed individ-
ual who was laboriously consuming a
large cigar to the detriment of the al-
ready stifling atmosphere  she aint
got no call to hand out that rough stuff
to strangers

  the man awoke from the state of in-
difference with which he had regarded
his surroundings and growled

   aw-thats nothin an i don no-
tice the stranger gettin on his ear about
it whats eatin you anyway

   no lady would of done what she
done-an you know it bill gregg 
gregg laughed in the depths of his
great chest demolished his beer at a
gulp and wiping his mouth with the
back of his hand grinned across the
table at his partner

   can the hot air tillie an come
down to oith you been grousin about
my friens since i brung you in rosie
palers one swell skoit if there
wussent so much o her id hang up my
cadv-

  he didnt finish

  with surprising suddenness the dark
little girl rose gripped the glass of beer
at her hand and flung the contents
with all the force her fury gave into
greggs face

  you would she screamed pas-
sionately as if the flood-gates of her
wrath had been opened as a result of
considerable pressure  youd make
a monkey outa me-you big stiff 
gregg spluttered and almost swal-
lowed his cigar which sizzled and went
out

  the music and the dancing stopped
tillie glared about her like a hunted
thing as the dancers closed round
her and gregg blinded and infuriated
by the beer that stung in his eyes swore
and lunged wildly across the table


the all-story magazine

  some one screamed a glass crashed
to the floor and rollins white with
fear sprang up as tillie with a little
choked-off cry lurched away from
greggs blow slipped and toppled back-
ward-into my lap

  a burst of raucous laughter greeted
the denouement and the matter ended
there

  ere gregg could recover his balance
several men crowded about him and
forced him back into his chair while
tillie and i contrary to the facetious
advice of several kindly disposed per-
sons disentangled ourselves

  the girl casting but a single look
behind burst through the circle that
barred her way and fled

  rollins sat down again very slowly
visibly shaking and looking as if he
feared another rumpusthat would not
terminate so swiftly

  i observed della staring straight at
me without a particle of life in her ex-
pression her cathedral parkway
clothes had given way to a waist and

   o	j

skirt but it was easy to see that that
made no difference to jimmy though
it was difficult to understand whether
he was attentive to her because of her
standing with the  chief -r simply
because he wanted to be on his own
account

  suddenly in the midst of the general
chatter and the work of pacifying the
ponderous gregg-who you may re-
member was put upon the trail of the
negro batch-some one shouted 

   shake her up della heres
crabbe and paler 

  della swung lazily toward the piano
as i turned my head toward the door
rollins glanced swiftly at me we both
watched the advance of  sub-lieuten-
ants  crabbe and paler who came
down the center of the floor in a direct
line swerving not an inch to avoid col-
lision with any one but making the
others give them the right of way

  they were of equal height walked
arm-in-arm and physically were per-
fect specimens-until they came a little
nearer then i wanted to laugh

  each had one eye 

  and each had the one the other
hadnt k

  i could not even now tell you which
had which

  rollins was plainly in distress sug-
gesting that he had met crabbe possi-
bly but once and as any one would
have been likely to do trusted to
recognizing him again through the
medium of the hollow eye-socket

  they marched up to greggs table
to the accompaniment of ragtime and
the little crowd that hung round til-
lies aggrieved victim faded away
iled by the straw-haired girl to resume
dancing

  gregg looked up at the odd pair sul-
lenly

   aw - she was grousin all the
time he whined before the others
had given any indication that they
knew anything about it and as if he
expected some punishment or other
 what ye want to come layin it on
to me for  

  whos goin to you big rummy
the fellow nearest me asked and
grinned the width of his face
 trouble with you gregg you got
a hunch that the whole woild quits
woik jus to give you hell tillie aint
said a woid for or again you so don
go pannin her why don you git up
an rag you aint worryin bout the
coons healt are you 

   quit your kiddin paler the big
man advised and almost smiled  if
that nigger shakes the hosptal inside
o a mont-ill put him back to woik
out his time the smile became a
laugh callous and cruel and gregg
raised his large bulk out of the chair
slowly

   think rosied slam me if i ast
her to do a turn wit me  

   i aint got rosies taste paler
returned  mebbe she wouldnt you
got a tongue aint you  

  gregg lumbered across the floor
dodging the dancers with surprising
agility and found a table temporarily
vacant upon the other side of the
a thieves comedy



room paler took the seat he had
vacated crabbe who had not spoken
so far but whose one eye held enough
shrewdness and evil to fill a dozen of
the ordinary kind seemed to notice
rollins all at once and on the point
of sitting down waved his hand to
him

   lo old sport how goes it  have
another on me

  rollinss face twitched peculiarly and
his lips appeared to get in the way of
the things he wanted to say

   i will-but later id like to speak
to you later-er-outside i have
something-

   aw-gwan bill gregg what ya
take me for a truck-horse i got
nough tub do haulin myself roun let
alone you me for blondy 

  miss palers strident voice drowned
everything else and ere i quite knew
what had happened she was standing
over me asking me if i could turkey-
trot

  she was very large ancl rough-but
there wasnt an ounce of evil in her
eyes

   im afraid not hadnt you better
choose some one more accomplished
than i 

   nothin doin miss paler de-
clared and froze rollins with a glance
because he dared to move his hand
nervously toward his glass  you
gotta trot wit me afore you leave the
room

   the minute i seen you i says  its
no use rosie you cant play no games
wit the cards stacked again you this
new guy is your finish  see so if
you aint goin to hop well sen your
frien over to keep bill gregg compny
an-

   cut that out rosie her brother
broke in quietly

   aw-leave her be crabbe con-
tended and swung round upon some of
the others who were threatening to be-
come inquisitive  what ye rubberin
at aint the pianner still goin you
wanted to speak to me sir 

  the final question was directed at

    	s

rollins who though he rose shakily
seemed glad to do it

   er-eh-yes pardon me just a
moment will you 

   certainly i agreed  i am sure
the lady will entertain me while you
are gone

  rollinss lips were blue and his smile
was ghastly appearing not to notice
i glanced up at miss paler

   wont you sit down 

  rollins and crabbe moved away
probably the only eyes that did not fol-
low them were rosies

  a low laugh coming from behind
me made her raise her head sharply
and her glance went over my shoulder

  ill bust you ted paler she
threatened vehemently and her cheeks
became beet red

  but her brother only grinned and
called the waiter which reminded me
of my duty

   can i offer you anything 

  rosie glanced quickly about her as
if she were afraid that some one might
be watching us and a few were sur-
reptitiously

   you think im fresh dont you 
she asked just as rollins and crabbe
disappeared

   not at all i assured her with one
eye upon the signal-light at the door
 do you indulge at all  

  she looked steadily at me for fully
a minute before she answered and i
imagined she had got my pedigree by
that time

  you dont belong here mister
she told me in a much quieter tone
 an i guess you think were a bunch
o roughnecks well we are if you
was born the son o a man what had-
what had done time where the hotel
bill dye think youd be to-day 

  i hated to think about it rosies
wisdom was not to be trifled with and
one found after a few minutes that
her face had more kindness than rough-
ness in it

   i dont know i replied  i sup-
pose the great majority do go down
dont they

referring to the waiters appearance-

the wagon since i quit the milk

   cant you trot none im a regu-
lar feather-weight when im dancing
an i wont put your shine on the blink
say della strike up-give us the
 robert e lee will you  

  the music ceased instantly amid a
chorus of divided opinion i did not
turn my head and kept my eyes fixed
upon the door

  there was a great deal of chatter
and chaff of which rosie bore the
brunt using her powers of repartee as
an expert fencer wields his foil then
a new ragtime piece set the  floor 
in motion again

  miss paler looked toward me

  with a glance at the door and an-
other at the already crowded floor
space i protested feebly

   there isnt any room for us

   there aint-eh  

  rosie rose and her voice rose higher
still

   beat it the bunch of you me an
blondys goin to show you how they
trot in high societee

  it cleared the floor like magic i
looked about me in search of relief
but there was none a storm of ap-
proval burst upon me from all sides
della turned her head stared blankly
at me for a moment or two-and
nodded

  no one else avoukl have thought it
was intended for me jimmy also
smiled encouragement and paler fix-
ing his single eye upon me said with a
grin

   be a sport she dont weigh moren
a ton

   ill paste you  rosie declared
wrathfully amid a roar of laughter

   never mind him i said and
rising offered my arm  may i have
the pleasure of dancing this number
with you  

   you sure may

  she grabbed my arm as if she were
afraid i might retract and to an ac-
companiment of cheers catcalls much
stamping of feet and the piano i was
dragged into the intricacies of the
turkey-trot

  the floor was bad but miss paler
had not lied about her weight when
dancing and dellas time when we
caught it above the tumult was perfect
we paid no attention to the remarks
of the bystanders witty and coarse
that came from all sides rosies
tongue seeming to have lost all desire
for revenge while her eyes became ac-
tually dreamy

  mine sped to the door every time i
faced it

  no one else looked that way the
attention of the entire company was
fixed upon us

   gee youre a swell dancer  my
partner murmured ecstatically after a
while and her fingers gripped my
shoulder like a vise  i aint such a
elephant am i

  of course not you dance beau-
tifully

  she smiled and her eyes softened
but two red eyes blinking in a little
black box near the door took my atten-
tion away from her and told me that
my time bad come

  we waltzed nearer and nearer to the
piano and my exit till we were within
a few feet of it

  the signal-light winked again twice

  jimmys forefingers went into his
mouth and a shrill whistle was the
result

  the lights went out

  even the bar shared the eclipse

  women screamed glasses went
crashing to the floor and something
like a stampede ensued rosie flung
her arms about me

  but that was not an embrace of fear

  just as a small hand came out of the
murk gripped my sleeve and tugged
rosie to my complete surprise whis-
pered softly

   youre all right blondy beat
it 
a thieves comedy



  and in the winking of an eye she
had kissed me

chapter xxiii

the motorman

  the small hand tugged again and
i did not have to be told that it was
dellas as i swung round in the direc-
tion in which i thought the door ought
to be

  but i did not have to search for it
or open it a large hand gripped my
arm thrust me forward into a greater
darkness and in a second i heard the
click of a key turning in a lock

  then i knew that i was in the kitchen
and alone

  i did not hesitate or halt to think
of anything save that the door to the
yard was  straight ahead and in a
few moments i had found it pulled the
knob to the right and was out in the
open air

  whew but that was good after the
reeking weight of the atmosphere in
the back room and i stood for a few
seconds breathing it deep down into my
lungs

  then i turned to my right

   two wire fences and a wooden
one i repeated to myself  and
brannigans back door

  how ridiculously simple it had been
and how perfectly rollins had been
fooled i had been at sea most of the
time myself everything had been so
utterly unlike what i had anticipated

  as i crept under the first fence the
commotion in the  clachan  died
away so i presumed the lights had
been turned on again and peace re-
stored

  i speculated upon what rollins
thought of it-if anything had hap-
pened to him in the dark not that i
cared particularly whether anything
had or not so long as the little beast
wasnt killed i hoped campbells ar-
rangements had been content to stop at
the fifty thousand dollars he had paid
for the evenings amusement

  crawling under the second fence
confident that no danger could lurk in
the back yards of unoccupied shops i
straightened up and tiptoed toward the
last hurdle that separated me from
brannigans

  the fence was of boards rickety in
every sense of the word i was half
way over when i felt the tug of a nail
that threatened to rip the pocket of
my coat and as i tried to free myself
without damage a hand came out of
the darkness behind me and hauled me
back to earth

  for a second or two i did not know
what to think i could only feel the
pressure of very powerful fingers about
my arm and was conscious of a dark
shadow that looked down at me and
inquired very quietly

  where do you think youre
going 

  i blinked up at the fellow with my
tongue glued to the roof of my mouth
and saw after my eyes became clearer
that he was a tram-car motorman-the
one wtho had preceded rollins and my-
self down fifty-fourth street

   w-what are you doing here   i
managed to articulate  what right
have you to-

   now sonny ill make it easy for
you he interrupted quietly  dont
ask no questions any man hereabouts
that takes to climbing back-yard fences
this hour o the night cant afford to be
inquisitive about another fellows game
you an me are goin to a nice quiet
place to have a little talk

   but great guns man i-

   thatll be about all keep it till
its needed

  i did not understand and all the
while he spoke he kept a firm grip upon
my arm but when he tried to pull me
with him down ihe yard i objected
forcibly and succeeded in wrenching
myself free

  but it was only for a minute

  with an oath which i flattened with
my left against his teeth he rushed
upon me and in trying to avoid him
i tripped and fell backward


the all-story magazine

  two seconds later there was a
 bracelet upon my right wrist and
my motorman holding the other or-
dered me to get up

   youll sweat for that one he in-
formed me viciously feeling his mouth

   and you will suffer for this out-
rage   i returned my temper rising

   all right let it go at that come
on

  there avas nothing else for me to
do dragging me after him through
the murk to the rear door of the shop
we had passed inside while i gaped and
wondered where he had got the keys
since campbell had told me that he
paid  rent to himself  for both shops

  the place was quite empty and my
motorman seemed to know his way
about leading me to the front door
without any hesitation whatever it
was closed but unlocked

  he stood for a while before opening
it as if he were listening for some
sound or other he expected to hear
then very cautiously his hand went
out to the knob as the rattle of an ap-
proaching wagon came to our ears

  in a moment we were outside and
the door which was not flush with the
front of the building was locked

  a policeman in uniform idly swing-
ing his night-club stood upon the side-
avalk probably a foot from the door-
way  he was a big policeman and his
back was toward us

  anythin doin rafferty the
motorman asked keeping in the shad-
ows of the doorway and holding me
there too

  rafferty did not turn his head

   loights wint out tin minits since
sorr didn ye hear the wimin
screamin  

  the motorman coughed

   anybody leave  

   three men sorr wan av thim
was drunk

   carey go in to see what the hol-
lerin was about  

   yes sorr barkeep said as there
was somethin the matter wid the
switch

   huh 

  a pause rafferty continued to
swing his night-stick and to face front
a passer-by glanced quickly up at him
and passed on

  the motorman hesitated a moment
or two then removed the handcuff
from my wrist

   im bein decent to you because i
think youre only a boob thats got in
wrong he told me quietly  go
round to the station-house with raf-
ferty there-an dont try for to beat
him up or hell knock your block off
rafferty 

   yes sorr

   take this gentleman round to your
station-house and let the reserve squad
keep him company till i get there

  rafferty turned his head and
whether he had known of my existence
before or not he showed no surprise

i knew it was perfectly useless to ob-
ject and caution bade me hold my
peace until such time as i could talk
to advantage

  i fell in by raffertys side and
walked with him quite respectably
leaving the motorman standing in the
shop doorway

  the policeman did not speak nor
did i all the way to the station peo-
ple looked at us of course and i felt
uncommonly guilty of something or
other but i wasnt a bit afraid of the
outcome-after i had thought a little

  the lieutenant on desk-duty at the
station-house glanced up from an eve-
ning newspaper and looked at me over
his glasses as rafferty piloted me in

  well

   detective parks said i wuz to
hould him in the mins room sorr

   what for parks make any
charge  

   no sorr

   oh is that so what does
parks think this station-house is
aint he got men enough of his own
without yanking mine off their beats
to pull his easy marks had carey
wastin his time around that dump too
i suppose  
a thieves comedy



   yes sorr

  and malone

   no sorr

   huh 

  frowning the lieutenant went back
to his paper evidently he and parks
were not of the same mind regarding
 that dump and i remembered that
parks was the central office man who
had tipped his hat so respectfully to
campbell in the city hall

   leave him here and get back on
your beat 

   yes sorr

  rafferty saluted and trudged out
leaving me suspended in mid air as it
were before the desk

the lieutenants attention was di-
vorced from his paper to me again by a
slow uplifting of his head and he had
eyes that went through one like gimlets
 come over here 

  i went to the rail that surrounded
him as with majesty leaning upon it

   what do you do for a living 

   nothing at present if you know
any one who needs a chauffeur though
id be glad to-

  the clerk put his hand over his
mouth and the lieutenants paper went
down upon his desk with a crackling
bang

   are you trying to kid me 

   not at all i am perfectly
serious

  for almost a minute he simply sat
looking at me and out of the corner
of my eye i saw through the open door
of an adjoining room several of what
i presumed was the  reserve squad 
craning their necks to hear and see

   what did parks pull you for 
you mean the motorman i
queried innocently

  huh motorman thats nough
anybody that parks can fool with a
get-up like that is a rube but what
did he pull you for 

   climbing fences a friend of
mine and i went down to a beastly
place on the corner of some avenue
or other-im an englishman you
know-

   sure i know

   there was dancing and all that sort
of thing then the lights went out
i didnt know what the dickens was up
but i was very near a door and i
skipped through it and found myself
in a yard i started to climb fences
looking for a way out and had got
over two when that idiot-

   idiot 

  the lieutenant repeated the word
with relish and grinned his approval

   -collared me and had me carted
up here

  the lieutenant looked at me quiz-
zically

   i bet parks thought hed grabbed
a hot one  he exclaimed and filled
the office with his laughter

  but a commotion behind me ended it
very abruptly

  swinging about i saw a few in-
quisitive people upon the sidewalk just
below the green lights of the station-
house and in another half-minute a
policeman appeared handcuffed to a
little woman who stared stolidly at
the ground

  i had seen the policeman a week be-
fore at the corner of tenth avenue
and fifty-fourth street his pris-
oner had been walking with me at the
time

  she was beans borrowmans friend
-mrs varelli

chapter xniv
the finish

  her hair hung about her face in
straggling disorder reminding one of
a skye terrier there was a spot of
blood upon her cheek and red streaks
on her hands her torn clothing gave
every indication of a struggle

  it did not take me more than a sec-
ond to realize that it would never do
for either she or the policeman to
recognize me the story i had told
the lieutenant and the fact that i had
walked abroad with the owner of the
 clachan  would not agree


the all-story magazine

  i tried to get out of their way by
turning my back upon them and edging
slowly toward the reserves room

   where are you going  the lieu-
tenant asked sharply and i stopped at
once feeling sure that i had made my-
self still more conspicuous  stay
right there till youre told to move
what you got malone  

   a dago woman sorr she was
thryin for to make a corpse of that bad
divil tony varelli whin i butted in
shes his woife sorr

 huh do much damage to him 
 knoifed him twicet sorr in gor-
gans saloon the ambilance tuk him
away i got the names av witnesses
sorr

   all right lets get it entered
and- what are ye starin at both
of ye  

  i had impetuously turned my head
upon hearing malones charge against
the little italian girl and both were
regarding me cjuestioningly recog-
nition came into the prisoners wild eyes
first but it followed in the twinkling
blue of the irishmans very quickly
after though he seemed a bit undecided
about his guess

   nothin sorr he answered hur-
riedly  but i seen the gintleman
thare somewheres afore an i was
thryin for to plaice him

  i hoped fervently that he never
would mrs varelli was studying the
floor again

   here you krause  the lieutenant
roared suddenly toward the reserves
room  clear that bunch of rubber-
necks away from the door you have
seen this gentleman before malone 
 yes sorr somewheres

   huh thats vague enough
malone reddened a trifle and went
with his prisoner before the blotter in
which the charge against her with all
the necessary frills was entered while
i stood waiting for orders

  a reporter came in nodded to the
 czar of the precinct and hung about
until the latest entry in the blotter was
completed

  as mrs varelli a broken half-
savage atom of humanity was being
led away to temporary quarters she
looked quickly up at me plainly won-
dering why i was there

   know the lady 

  the lieutenants voice was so very
quiet it startled me and the reporters
attention came away from the blotter
instantly

   no

   seemed to know you

	 really 

  i saw the reporter grin the lieu-
tenants glance went over my shoul-
der

   heres parks he announced as
if it did not matter  i guess hes
stabbed blind found something an
didnt know it well go inside if you
dont mind frank

   yessir his assistant answered in-
stantly

   tell malone i want him to remem-
ber where he saw this gentleman and
to do it before he leaves the station-
house

   yessir

  the reporter was all eyes parks
came in quietly without any fuss and
i was marched into a room which i
presumed was intended for such con-
ferences as that which followed

  when the door was carefully closed
and i had accepted the offer of a chair
by a flat-top desk parks with a glance
at the lieutenant who remained stand-
ing began with 

   let me tell you something the
truth wont do you any harm but the
other thing will only get you in bad
what were you doin climbin them
fences  

  i told him my story

   sounds all right whered your
friend go  

   he went into the bar a few minutes
before the lights went out

   whats his name  

   rollins i answered unhesita-
tingly

   does he live in the city 

   central park west
a thieves comedy



   uni-swell what took you to
that hole

   rollins has been showing me the
city for the past week and wanted to
let me see the rough as well as the
smooth

  parks and the lieutenant exchanged
glances

  youre just over the former
asked after a second or two

   yes-i came across on the ran-
dania ten days ago

   and whats your name and ad-
dress 

  i gave him both and he nodded
recognition of the name of the hotel

   well mr mason you look all
right and you talk all right but id
like to know why your friend rollins
came to me and said that if id guaran-
tee his safety in macgregors saloon
to-night hed put me wise to something
good about that rob roy bunch ive
been trying to hang something  for
a year

  i dont know whether my face be-
trayed what i felt or not parks gave
no sign of suspicion and i dared not
look up to see what the lieutenant
thought

   he tried to- tell me that he thought
the brains of that bunch was a fifth
avenue millionaire  what dyou think
of that peters 

  lieutenant peters laughed and i
joined him-heaven knows how

   that was the gag he gave me
parks continued  i thought he was
loony but as i had business down here
to-night i thought id humor the poor
little gink-and no offense to you sir
wonder where he skipped to  

   i should like to know too i de-
clared more anxiously than my in-
quisitors realized

   leave me his address will you 
parks asked  no you neednt mind
ill get it in the telephone-book and
call him later to see if he got home
i knew you were his friend the minute
i grabbed you but i wanted to be sure
you knew nothin-and i guess you
dont hope theres no ill-feelin 

   i was a little hasty myself if you
will remember

  parks smiled and rose and i fol-
lowed suit

   just a minute

  the lieutenants quiet voice sat me
back in my chair again parks looked
up and the lieutenant asked 

   are you all through 

   sure hes dry

  well if you dont think im but-
ting in pel like to ask him a-few

  parks hesitated a moment then sat
down smiling

  peters saw that smile i knew it
would not do me any good his gim-
letlike eyes fastened themselves upon
my face and did not leave it

   what about that chauffeur story
you told me mr mason 

  i laughed and i meant it parks
seemed at a loss

   lots of chaps who have no money
know all sorts of well-to-do people i
am tired of having no money and
driving somebodys car is about the
only thing i could tackle i lost quite
a little money in wall street to-day
so ive simply got to get something to
do i suppose you read of it-the
rand island smash

  parks smiled and his eyes held a
hint of kindness mingled with triumph
the lieutenant looked puzzled

   you cant feeze him the detect-
ive declared  because hes straight
 all right ring that bell will
you  

   what the-

   thats nough i am running this
station-house right now ring the
bell

  parks with a look of wonderment
pressed a button under the table a
policeman answered it

   malone gone  

   no sir

   send him in here with that varelli
woman

   yessir

  whats the idea parks ques-
tioned and glanced from the lieutenant
to me  do you know  


the all-story magazine

  i shook my head-and all over too
-and sat on pins and needles till ma-
lone and his prisoner entered

   close the door and come over
here both of you the lieutenant or-
dered sharply  here you --to airs
varelli- keep your head up

  the little italian woman was sullen
her inky-black eyes gleamed danger-
ously malone stolidly subservient
looked everywhere else but at his chief

   this gentleman says hes only been
over here ten days the latter declared
slowly  now take a good look at
him and tell me how you both come to
have seen him before you understand
me  

  the question was directed at mrs
varelli

   no unerstan she replied sulkily

  you dont-eh the lieutenant
took two steps toward her and she
shrank from him wriggling in the be-
wildered malones grasp

   dont be scared i aint going to
do nothin to you tell me-youve
seen that man before 

  mrs varellis expression became
even more dark her free hand went
up and brushed her hair from her face
so that we all saw the savagery in it
more clearly and her glance like a
dagger-point fell upon me

  i sat perfectly still waiting and
watching to see her lips move we
were all doing that-only i think i
realized the hate in her eyes more keen-
ly than the others

   sure i seen heem--heem an da
gregarack 

  her voice was hoarse threatening
to crack and the stillness that followed
it was painful parks looked round
the kindness and triumph had gone
from his face

  the gregarach-eh the lieu-
tenant grinned as if it did not surprise
him  when and where was that 

   a wake ago sorr i remimber
now malone broke in suddenly
 him and mr macgregor an this
woman sorr came up fifty-fourth
street all together

  is that right mrs varelli you
saw this gentleman last week  

  the girl nodded viciously

   dey maka me go back to tony
an tony heet me twen dop i save
an tony steala evry dol-an he heet
me-dere  

  throwing back her hair still further
she revealed a great blue-black lump
that had bled a little

   eef da gregerack no maka me go
back to tony i-

   all right-keep it for the district
attorney take her away malone
the irishman removed his charge
and when the door closed i felt
strangely alone

  again the lieutenant grinned
parkss lips were drawn very tightly
together and the steadiness of his gaze
embarrassed me

   so youd kid me eh  

  he rose from his chair slowly-a
giant of a man-his cheeks white with
anger and his eyes shining amid the
pallor like little pieces of live coal

  i did not move something seemed
to chain me to the chair though my
hands clenched and my sinews became
painfully taut

   go easy parks the lieutenants
voice cautioned  you aint got any-
thin on him yet

   huh id only let rockefeller
fool me once put your hands on that
table 

   but i say-

   can that put your hands on that
table 

   what are you going to do 

  plis right hand went behind him
swiftly and came forward again bear-
ing a weapon

   parks  the lieutenant warned
again

  its all right put your hands on
that table 

  i obeyed not that i was afraid the
beggar would shoot i knew he
wouldnt do that but a revolver-well
-did you ever look down the barrel of
one in the hands of a chap who was
very angry
a thieves comedy



  in less time than i take to write it
he had gone through my pockets first
slapping them in search of a weapon
and came upon my pocketbook which
he tossed over to the lieutenant

   look through that peters

  peters without any compunction
looked and found principally-two
pawn-tickets

   one pendant a thousand at berg-
sons two rings at seven hundred
and fifty at nospims he read off
quietly  hocked the same day
at nospims too gee youre a
dandy 

  he regarded me in undisguised ad-
miration

  parks put up his revolver took the
tickets from the lieutenant and looked
them over

  then he paid me the same compli-
ment

   you sure dont look it he said at
last slowly and shook his head  but
i know you aint in with that rob roy
bunch-yet theyd never leave them-
selves wide open like that but i guess
youll sleep in the pen to-night after
all

  and i did

chapter xxv

the intruder

  i was held as a  suspicious per-
son because i would not explain how
i a bachelor living in a hotel and
acquainted with the suspected mac-
gregor had come by so feminine a
piece of jewelry as a pendant

  parks then took me back to the
privacy of the room we had been in
and after further cross-examination
his opinion of me developed so far as
to rate me as a  classy hotel and
steamship crook and he tried to
frighten me by guessing at the length
of my scotland yard record

  he telephoned my hotel and appar-
ently learned that no one had missed
anything

  then he rang up the rollins apart-

ment and learned that my  friend 
had not yet arrived home it did not
seem to excite him a great deal hang-
ing up the receiver he swung lazily
upon me

   hope nothins happened to your
friend he declared because if any-
thing has youre going to get in worse
an worse how did you come to
know this saloonkeeper they call the
 gregarack   

   that is my affair

   all right i aint in any hurry
ive been after him for a year and i
guess i can wait a week or so longer
 you dont mean to say youre
going to keep me in one of your cells
for a week you cant you have no
charge-nothing

   no-but i will have when the guy
that owns them sparks you soaked
misses them dont tell me what i can
or cant do

   hang it all-isnt there such a
thing as habeas corpus

  he leaned his elbow upon the flat-
top of the desk and looked with pene-
trating steadiness up at me

   sleep on this mr slick if i want
to you can do a seven-year stretch--
just as you stand without nothin but
them bits o paper to say  heres how
i say if i want to

   while youre tryin to sleep re-
member that we got the guinea woman
too an that she apparently doesnt
love you nor gregarack shes likely
to know a thing or two and likely to
holler

   your friend rollins may be down
to see me to-morrow and he may not
be such a fool as he looks if you
want to get the benefit of bein under
the wire before your competitors
dont be bashful its your only
chance i said youd sweat for that
one you handed me and i aint goin
back on my word

  i regarded him a moment or two
wondering if he really expected me to
believe him

   you seem to forget theres a brit-
ish consul in this city


the all-story magazine



   he dont cut any ice his brows
lowered and bis hand went out to a
push-button  think it over and let
me know the result in the morning

  a white-haired chap in uniform
came in and saluted

   take him away parks growled
and the turnkey took my arm and led
me out

  i spent a very restless night in a
dark cubby hole of a place wondering
incessantly whether i would get out in
time to meet margaret at half past ten
the following morning-

  parkss threats could not keep me
awake  laughed at them but a
vision of margaret-a little pale per-
haps but hopeful-looking about her
vainly for the man who had promised
and did not come grew more painfully
distinct every minute

  it did not soothe me a great deal to
know that there was nothing criminal
that could be proved against me

  even though i should succeed in
getting in touch with the british con-
sul and rousing him on my behalf it
was a thousand to one that the red-
tape would not unwind quickly enough
for my needs

  applying to campbell was too risky
parks knew him and doubtless he had
studied the gregarach too that i
knew them  both  might set the de-
tectives mind off upon a line of
thought which rollinss hint regarding
the identity of the leader of the rob
roy gang would serve to strengthen

  i did not care to think of rollinss
treachery it led my mind into very
unpleasant fields of thought

  campbells double-dealing seemed
very near its end and with that end
must come chaos the man responsi-
ble for it would notte likely to escape
scatheless

  the night dragged on sixty hours
to the minute it seemed and some one
who brought his heels down upon the
flags in the passage with the snap of
an exploding percussion-cap paced to
and fro most of the time making
sleep still more impossible

  upon my right some poor fright-
ened creature whined at intervals in an
eery fashion while the chap on my left
snored frightfully and once i hei-d
the sound of a sob

  in the cell the air was heavy to the
point of suffocation and everything
one touched was hard and unyielding
-no sympathy about anything

  when the dawn came my mind had
found no relief margarets accusing
eyes were everywhere even daylight
did not dispel them and after that
with unreasonable speed flew on to-
ward half past ten

  about eight oclock a uniformed
chap brought me wretched coffee and
rolls which i would not touch ten
minutes later another fellow came in
and told me i was  wanted he led
me into the same room as before
parks was there alone

  the detective seemed to have had
as little sleep as i pie sat at the desk
in a leaden sort of way growled at
the fellow who had brought me in so
that he saluted and departed then the
detective tapped the desk for a minute
or two with a huge digit while his
gaze heavy as his attitude came round
to me verv slowly

   well  

   id like to telephone the british
consul as soon as his office opens
i declared as calmly as possible

  parks ignored the remark com-
pletely

  have you thought it over he
asked deliberately

   there was nothing to think over
no your friend rollins hasnt
got home yet

  i stared at him unable to utter a
syllable then

   youre quite sure of that 

   yes-and i guess you are too

   what do you mean 

   nothin that you dont under-
stand he returned sharply  rollins
was last seen with you you went
into that place together by the front
door the lights g-o out i find you
making your getaway over the back
a thieves comedy



fences rollins disappears whats
the answer

   ill tell you that poor little gink
was too wise an you got on to him
you were great pals-you an him-
but he never doped it out that you
were stringin him gettin ready to do
him up you met gregarack last week
and fixed it for last night and agreed
to lead rollins down to his finish i
guess he had a hunch there was some-
thing liable to happen to him and he
came to me for protection now do
you know where you stand 

  he leaned a little farther over and
his eyes did their best to frighten me

   you mean that i am in danger of
being hanged for murder 

  he sat back in his chair again and
regarded me

   some nerve he concluded finally
and added in an easy tone grega-
rack should be here in an hour

   you mean-

  i stopped and shut my teeth on the
rest

  huh that worries you

  i made no answer everything
round about me was quiet as the grave
so much so that i had a suspicion that
the room was sound-proof parks
moved a little in his chair and
drummed upon the desk again

  give yourself a chance he ad-
vised suddenly in an almost friendly
tone  you wont stand any when the
crash comes if you dont get in ahead
of the bunch theyll be failin over
themselves tryin to get to the district
attorney

   this aint london a slick article
like you can play merry-go-round wit
scotland yard because they aint got
nothin on you they got to get evi-
dence-loads of it-afore they can put
you away

   here its different if we dont
like a guys looks-thats enough if
he makes a hit with us-thats enough
too the other way im givin you a
chance before the gregarack comes
after that youre dished how about
it

  i almost told him he was an ass but
checked the impulse in time and re-
membering that he was viewing me
from the  hotel and steamship crook 
angle did not think his remarks so
idiotic

   sorry but i cant take advantage
of your offer because i have nothing
to tell

  parkss eyebrows fell with ominous
suddenness his face became black as
thunder for half a minute i was cal-
culating which would be the better
blow-an uppercut or a straight right

  i thought he was going to hurl him-
self at me in sheer bad temper

  but he didnt

  the door opened just then and-

  oh-hello parks on the job
bright and early eh  heres a gentle-
man who wants to see you

  i turned my head and saw a man
in the uniform of a police-captain
holding the door open for campbell

chapter xxvi

the denial

  he closed the door behind him and
for a moment or two stood with his
back to it-a modern hercules garbed
as a gentleman smiling contentedly
upon our amazement

  parkss lips worked convulsively
and i thought he was going to demand
campbells expulsion instead he rose
slowly staring as one who sees a
ghost

  i looked from one to the other in
astonishment wondering how on earth
campbell managed to keep his face
straight

  the uniformed individual whom i
took to be the captain of the precinct
went to the chair parks had occupied
and said as he sat down

   mr campbell has an order from
judge earquhar to parole his friend
mr mason in his custody i guess
that goes

    this gentleman is mr mason
campbell declared coming over to me


the all-story magazine

                             j

his deep tones sounding like the low
reverberant roll of distant thunder
 im sure he does not look like a hor-
rible example

  he gripped my hand in both of his
 im sorry i could not get down
sooner i just got in from chicago at
one oclock and found that fathead
rollins in my rooms scared to death
that the police were after him for get-
ting horribly drunk last night and
raising the dust generally he only re-
membered that you had been with him
after i asked him how you had been
getting along

  he laughed and i joined him in un-
qualified admiration

  the captain grinned too and
glanced up at parks who stood apart
studying campbell with an intentness
that i thought dangerous

   then of course campbell went
on  the search for you began rol-
lins was sure you had been killed the
place you were at was just that sort
lie said-where men kill men for a
song and get drunk on the music 
again we laughed-all but parks
campbell turned to the detective

   where on earth did you find him
why was he held here overnight
parks licked his lips he looked un-
comfortable and did not seem very
anxious to reply

  whats the trouble parks the
captain asked scrutinizing the de-
tective heavily  mr mason looks all
right to me and i guess if mr camp-
bell and judge farquhar say hes
o k that about cinches it you got
him entered as suspicious what avas
he doin

   climbin back-vard fences parks
returned sulkily and went no farther

   back-yard fences  campbell ex-
claimed in horror  for lands sakes
mason-where 

   somewhere on eleventh avenue
i think-a bit west of a place where
they keep cars i replied as innocently
as i could and explained why i had
been climbing fences just as i had ex-
plained it to parks

  the captains brows came together
in a frown

   thats macgregors saloon isnt
it   he asked of parks

   oh  that peculiar chap   camp-
bell exclaimed  i own most of that
section you know and if my memory
serves me right macgregor rents the
two stores next to his place because
he wishes to make a dance-hall out of
them i am not particularly in favor
of dance-halls-not his sort would
you recommend me permitting it cap-
tain  

  the captain eyed his interrogator
for about half a minute parks was
watching campbell like a hawk and
both officials seemed to have the same
thought

   have you ever seen macgregor
mr campbell the captain asked
very quietly

   once i think in my agents office
fie was a hulking man if i am not
mistaken and my firmest recollection
of him is the waistcoat he wore does
his place make as much noise as it
did 

  not the flicker of an eyelid was visi-
ble and the smile a little whimsical
was perfect

  the captain looked puzzled and
laughed forcedly

   its the quietest saloon in my pre-
cinct macgregor runs it like a tea-
room though the worst crowd in
christendom collects there - every
man of thems been behind the bars
for everything-from petty larceny to
murder two of the classiest safe-
crackers in the business are among
them-the funniest pair to look at you
ever saw each has only one eye-
but even with that landmark we cant
get enough on them to put them where
they belong did you read of that
yonkers job-where the burglars left
their cards behind 

   i believe i did campbell replied
i glanced toward my boots

 well-we know who did it
theres only one man in the business
who would open a safe like that-but
a thieves comedy



we cant touch him it isnt a bit o
use pulling him to have to let him go
because we cant collect enough evi-
dence to hold him and hes got
money to burn in his defense wed
have grabbed macgregor long ago but
for that

  campbell nodded understandingly

   seems a pity that the law should
be so arranged to make the presence or
absence of funds an important factor
theres something rotten in that state
of denmark didnt you say mason
that you were arrested by the detective
here after youd got over the second
fence  

  the sudden switching of the subject
made parks fidget apparently he did
not care for the change

   yes the second fence i an-
swered with my attention fixed upon
the detective  and he hauled me
through an empty store to the street
that was rather brutal i know but
it was what campbell wanted

  he glanced quickly at the captain
and back to parks neither looked
very happy

   i suppose you got permission from
macgregor mr parks campbell
queried mildly  any particular
trouble expected

   i guess i owe you an apology mr
campbell parks began as if deciding
to put the best face he could upon the
matter  i didnt know i was pullin
a friend of yours-but a friend of
macgregors

  that velvet-covered claw was al-
most clever the captain turned his
head and we all from knowledge or
suspicion studied campbells face

   he smiled a little satirically and his
eyes were peculiarly quiet

   i havent much respect for mac-
gregor if he gives the police permis-
sion to enter his back yards to arrest
his friends arent you just a trifle
mixed mr parks 

  parks looked it but he growled de-
fiantly

   he knows macgregor he was
seen-

   doubtless campbell interrupted
quickly  if he was at the chaps
saloon he would be likely to meet and
know him i am very sorry rollins
took him down to that placc and when
he gets back from boston-

   boston  parks said it

   yes when he left me he said he
was going to run up to boston till the
thing blew over he was awfully
scared and i imagine he thought he
did something much more serious than
putting out the lights just for the
dubious pleasure of hearing a lot of
women scream

   after i had telephoned mr
masons hotel and learned that the
police had been inquiring there about
him i rang up rollins at his apart-
ment and they told me he hadnt put
in an appearance but had called up to
say he would not be home as he was
going right out of town for a few
days but i dont believe the beggar
went at all

   perhaps he thought better of it as
he grew more sober and -nodding
toward parks- i think it was your
name he babbled in the early hours of
the morning in connection with some-
thing or other he had to tell you ring
him up again and see if hes actually
gone

  it was superbly done and there was
more emphasis upon that  again 
than i could understand where he
had got all his information baffled me
and in those few minutes i stood men-
tally aghast learning to appreciate
why campbell had kept out of jail so
long

  parks looked like a man who had
been fooled and knows it his lips
tightened and i saw him glance to-
ward the telephone then sharply into
his tormentors face

   how do you know i called be-
fore  

  that flattened me i shrank behind
campbell mentally and physically

  campbell brushed a speck from his
coat-lapel and murmured to it as the
rumble of wheels came to our ears


the ale-story magazine

   some one in the rollins establish-
ment who was very much annoyed
asked me when i rang up  are you
here again and then of course
apologized and told me that a man
named parks had rung up several
times and since miss rollins wasnt
very well the repeated ringing of the
telephone bell was annoying didnt
she say too that rpllins had gone out
of town  	

  the affirmative answer to both ques-
tions was written in parkss face and
i dont suppose it made him feel any
better for me to know that he had lied
to me there was no hint of malice in
campbells tones he was laughing at
parks and i think the detective
knew it

  the captain rose abruptly and said
in a rather tired tone

   well i guess the argument doesnt
lead anywhere mr campbell if youll
come out to the desk with me well get
mr masons belongings my advice
to him is to keep away from joints like
macgregors piell be less likely to
get into trouble

   my point exactly captain camp-
bell declared as he gripped my arm
 only you mustnt blame mr mason
-hes only been here ten days

  parkss right hand resting upon the
table clenched slowly he did not
speak but i could see that he was
thinking very rapidly and could feel
his eyes digging into the middle of my
back as campbell and i followed the
captain out of the room to the desk
outside

  there was a black police-van at the
door campbells car was visible
through the window several of the
morbidly curious hung about the side-
walk

  and there was a young man talking

-	or rather trying to talk - to the
lieutenant at the desk

  campbell saw him before i did and
with perfect ease took the captain
aside as if he had something very pri-
vate to say to him leaving me to at-
tack the situation alone

  the young man was beans borrow-
man 

  a chill struck my heart and it sank
with nauseating suddenness my hand
went out fumbling for the rail about
the desk and blindly finding it my
fingers held on like grim death other-
wise i think i should have collapsed

  that stuffy cell yawned again with
campbell and his lieutenant for neigh-
bors

  beanss glance came over the lieu-
tenants shoulder and his eyes for a
second perhaps became like saucers-
then they were mere slits

  feeling the floor sliding away from
under me i heard the lieutenant at the
desk say bruskly

   you cant see her unless when
shes on her way to the wagon whatd
you wanna see her for anyway you
aint a dago  

  beanss dusty face grew black and
as i got a grip upon my legs and
moved in a leaden sort of way to the
desk he edged away from it and
skulked foot by foot nearer to the
outer door his expression gradually
becoming more doubtful as he studied
campbells perfectly tailored back

    youre goin to shake us 

  the lieutenants affable query
startled me

   yes i stammered and fervently
hoped he spoke the truth

    well i guess youll find every-
thing there

  he handed me a package which i
accepted not really caring whether
everything was in it or not and i
stuffed my watch card-case and so
forth into my pockets as quickly as i
could with an anxious eye for the
threatening situation round about me

  with his side toward the street and
beans campbell faced the door which
led to the cells his right hand out of
the captains sight rested on his hip

  suddenly parks appeared in the
doorway walking with lockstep pre-
cision before a prisoner apparently
just brought from the  cooler

  it wasmrs varelli
a thieves comedy



  still shuffling toward the door re-
garding campbells attire beanss ex-
pression changed halting and hesi-
tating a moment or two his pallid lips
parted in a grin that vanished even
more quickly than it had come and
turning he slipped out and away like
a shadow just as parks within a yard
or two of campbell and the captain
swerved to one side

  mrs varelli startled a little looked
up and stopped as she so suddenly
caught sight of a man who looked like
the gregarach yet was so different

  campbell gave no sign that he knew
she was there even though the captain
broke off in the middle of something
he was saying to glance in her di-
rection

  disheveled and tattered her cheeks
streaked with tears she hated all the
world just then but parks swinging
about to watch only saw her eyes
brighten and the sullenness die out of
her face

  she almost smiled

   the lady seems to think she knows
you mr campbell  parks suggested
pleasantly and the policeman who ap-
parently understood his part did not
move on

   er-what lady oh

  campbell appeared to notice mrs
varelli of a sudden

   im afraid she has the advantage
of me he said smoothly after a mo-
ments study

  mrs varelli shot a swift glance to-
ward parks and her face became as
expressionless as a blank wall

   no understan

   youve seen him before  parks
assisted as if out of sheer kindness he
was humoring the poor girl

  she looked at him then at campbell
then at the captain and back to parks
again

  and shook her head

  i know de capn wen tony steals
da mon las year

   yes yes-but the other gentle-
man 

  mrs varelli looked straight up into

campbells face and found him
smiling

   how i know bigga man lika dat
me-im poora gal 

chapter xxvii

by the way

  the sigh of relief i drew was quite
audible i am sure the lieutenant
heard it but all he said was  sign
this  and tingling from head to foot
as a result of the reaction i grabbed
the pen he held out to me and shakily
signed a paper of some sort that might
have been my own death-warrant for
all i knew

  all ready mason-

  campbells deep-toned query helped
to dispel the numbness that had taken
possession of my mind and limbs and
glancing upward i saw him looking
past the chagrined parks over mrs
varellis head with a suggestion that
they both bored him a little

  parks glanced toward the policeman
in charge of the prisoner whose eyes
were studiously bent upon the floor
and they moved on toward the police-
wagon

  campbell shook hands with the cap-
tain who nodded to me and passed
into his office

  then the gregarach held out his
hand to parks

  the detectives cheeks grew scarlet
and his eyes looked everywhere in a
second-at me-at the men hanging
about the reserves room-out toward
the street where a small crowd stared
at the poor little italian woman being
driven-heaven knows where

   good-by mr parks

   good day sir

  there was all the difference in the
world in a word parks meant ait
rczoir as he accepted the hand of the
man he had been  tryin to get some-
thin on for a year

  in half a minute more we were out
in the street and into the waiting car

every throb of the machine spelled


the all-story magazine

freedom and the smile came back into
margarets eyes as i glanced at my
watch and found i had an hour to
spare

  at once the car swung out from the
curb and away from the sordid at-
mosphere of criminality two squares
latter i protested hurriedly

   i say i cant go- home with you
i have an important engage-

   not to-day pm afraid camp-
bell interrupted and the sparkle de
parted from his eyes  margaret will
be unable to keep her appointment
she met with a slight accident last eve-
ning and-

   what 

   rollins claims that she tripped
over a rug in the library and struck
her head against a sharp corner of the
mantel but the slight wound is at the
back of the head and there is a blue-
black mark over the left temple such
as might have been made by the blow
of a clenched fist

  i stared at him in horror

  you-you dont mean to say
he-

   exactly his jaws snapped on
the word like a trap and for a moment
i felt limp

  then resentment like a river in
flood swept over me i saw red and
rollinss ashen face across the table in
the club the previous evening i un-
derstood with a hideous desire to
wipe out his leering smile why lie had
been so extremely nervous when i
mentioned margarets name

 dont look so murderous camp-
bell said quietly after a while  one
might believe the delay annoyed your
what the deuce do you mean

   wheesht man its all right im
glad it does i found margaret in my
rooms this morning and she told me
all about it she ran away and came
to the only place she could trust but
i took her home again

   she told me several complimen-
tary things about you and im begin-
ning to think they werent altogether
too inflated but im afraid you dont

realize what matrimony on twenty-
flve-a-week means  

  into broadway we went but the
bustle of life there did not make me
feel any more cheerful we were
going up-town when i thought we
ought to be going down to the ferry

   what the dickens have you got to
do with it  i asked after a minute or
so and have to confess that i wtas a
little jealous of his air of authority
over margarets actions  ive played
my part in your affairs and i think
youre going to have enough to do
keeping out of jail without bothering
about my matrimonial intentions

  he only grinned

   margaret wouldnt marry you if i
said  no 

  the deuce she wouldnt you
might as well say that she only agreed
to do so simply because you put her
up to it 

   pretty nearly that

  this put a clamp on my tongue and
made me dull and heavy campbell
looked up at a great electric sign and
remarked with beastly irrevelance

   looks gaunt and ugly in the day-
light doesnt it 

  but i did not speak again until we
had reached his rooms

  after i had washed and made a pre-
tense of tackling breakfast-the while
campbell hung about the window quite
a lot-i asked pointblank with a men-
tal vision of the blue-black mark on
margarets forehead before me

   has rollins really gone to bos-
ton 

  campbell turned his head

   not exactly at present i believe
lie is recovering from the effects of a
harmless but necessary drug in my

-th street house

   good lord  

   interesting isnt it but there is
nothing to be alarmed about-yet
lets go inside and smoke i want to
telephone several people

  i rose and followed him into an ad-
joining room feeling my nether limbs
a little uncertain
a thieves comedy



   how the dickens did you gethim
there i asked accepting one of his
cigars

   on his feet crabbe and crowley
assisted him

   they were the three men-

   i suppose so they walked him
out under the noses of policemen
carey and rafferty and brought him
up to me i didnt know that anything
had happened to you until i called the
night-clerk at your hotel to see if you
had reached home all right he told
me that a detective parks had said he
had you in custody and had been seek-
ing information about you then of
course i understood that the motor-
man had been playing escort to rollins
when he walked down fifty-fourth
street in front of you

  i sat down slowly

   where were you 

   at home but crowley saw him
though he lost him afterward and you
found him in the last place in the world
crowley would have thought of look-
ing for him i knew then that to get
you out of jail id either have to let
rollins go or arrange a lie to account
for his disappearance the lie was
much easier

  the shadow of a smile came and
went and blowing a long stream of
smoke toward the ceiling he walked
over to the window and looked down
into the street seeming to have for-
gotten that he wanted to telephone i
could not see how the lie had been at
all easy it seemed deuced risky to
me

   do you know that rollins went to
parks and told him that the leader of
that choice company of yours was a
fifth avenue millionaire 

  campbell turned his head

   how do you know that 

   parks made a confidant of me
before he found the pawn-tickets

   i see i knew rollins rang up
 spring from his apartment about
a week ago and met parks at columbus
circle but of course i could not learn
what was said

    	s

   i stared at him and laughed fool-
 ishly

    how  earth-

    it isnt difficult people who live
 in apartment houses sign a slip for
 every call and the numbernof the call
 is on the slip rollins hasnt the faint-
 est idea that any one in his domestic
 employ knows what  spring
 means any more than he realizes that
 practically every movement he has
 made since you landed here has been
 watched

    that is why i went to the trouble
 of sending you over those fences i
 suspected that rollins would fetch an
 escort it isnt every man who can
 purpose murder with the assistance of
 the police 

   the audacity of the thing made me
 gasp had i been assassinated rollins
 would actually have had the favorable
 testimony of the police upon his side

   campbell glanced out of the window
 again and i took the opportunity to

	think a little in an effort to get things
 straight when he faced about and
 began pacing the floor restlessly i
 watched him for a minute then asked
  you mean you have some one in
 rollinss apartment-

    margarets maid i put her there
 some time ago with margarets inno-
 cent cooperation and it was she who
 helped me with the lie she used to be
 a dresser in the same company as the
 gobblers mother and is the ladv if
 you will remember who did not care
 so much for smiths blood as she did
 for his money so when i needed some
 one of the sort her qualifications
 seemed to answer perfectly

    then she knows that rollins is the
 gobblers father

   yes-and who i am too but
there is no murder in her eye and
she is no friend of the police she is
making too much money very easily to
wish to have the men who pay it-
blackmail

   no-no of course not but if
rollins were dead and i were in jail
her job which is paying her two sal-


the all-story magazine

aries would be gone after i am
through with him she can blackmail
him if she cares to as for myself
she cant tell parks any more than
rollins has done

   but she might hit at margaret

   not much fear of that principally
because when im through with rollins
margaret wont be there to be hit

  i colored slightly and felt the steady
gleam of his eyes uncomfortable

   dont mistake me didderington
he said in tones that went fathoms
deep  i have seen this coming since
the day rollins ran away to europe
and left nessie borrowman behind to
eat her heart out and die so long as
that scum crawled the earth i knew
that there was no safety for me or
mine but i made sure that if i fell
he would fall with me-and under-
neath  

  he went to the window again and
my eyes followed him dubiously won-
dering what the end would be

  after a little while he backoned me
and i rose and joined him

  through the curtains i saw a taxi-
cab a trolley two women a truck a
boy and a dog a large touring-car and
several men

   well   i asked wonderingly

   see that hat and shoulders just
down below 

  i craned my neck and saw

   yes what about them 

   i saw them in my minds eye
months ago and they just arrived this
minute they belong to one of parkss
men and there is probably another
we dont see there will be two more

watching the -th street house

where rollins is if i am not mistaken
we are going to have an interesting
evening

chapter xxviii

a busy wire

 we

   yes we must have everything in
order-parents consent and so on

its all right theres no danger
those fellows down there are only
anxious to know how i change my
skin just a minute

  he picked up the receiver while i
stood staring blankly wondering if he
wasnt quite mad

  giving a harlem number he called
presently

 hello jimmy macgregor
yes hes all right ship those
things he left with you the other day
up to dellas- yes-to-day and any-
thing else you may have nothing
else  good

   no-not yet but theres a chance
that some people may be up to look
you over all right you know what
to do yes im out of town oh-
three or four days good-by

  the receiver went up on the hook
slowly

   how do you run that place   i
asked marveling at his indifference at
the detective below

  he did not look at me as he answered
absently

   its just a blind we hold our col-
lections there for a while and then
get rid of them try and amuse your-
self for five minutes i think there are
some english weeklies on that table
over there hello  

  this time it was rollinss apart-
ment

  campbell did not ask for any one
and the english weeklies did not in-
terest me nearly as much as the one-
sided conversation that followed

 hello campbell yes any
more calls thats good yes miss
rollins feeling better no she
mustnt do that ill call for her

i am afraid youd better not i may
need you there make it some other
night

   impossible my dear girl i am
sure miss rollins needs you and i do
not think your sister is as important
as your safety is to yourself they
must not have the faintest suspicion-
whats that dont you think its
rather late in the day to say you dont
a thieves comedy



care better think it over quite im-
possible good-by

  the receiver went up impatiently
and his brows came together

   is that girl pretty  i asked

 yes-rather why

   and she wants to go out to-
night 

   to her sisters how did you
guess that  

   has she gone to her sisters often
of late  

   quite a lot why the catechism 
 because i am afraid her sister is-
ralph van huysen

  i suppose i saw in his face what he
had seen in mine many times-amaze-
ment of the blankest order but there
was something else an intermingling
of fear and anger-mostly the latter
his eyes became like steel pitiless and
hard

 say what ye mean man he
snapped it at me with a trace of scotch
and as if i were to blame for the whole
thing

  and i told him of the occasion on
which i had rung up the rollins apart-
ment

  it made him rise and take to pacing
the floor with the impatience of a caged
lion suddenly he swung upon me and
exploded

   there you have an example of the
everlasting conceit of which we are all
more or less guilty this girl saw
nessie borrowman throw her life
away on a worthless cur closed her
eyes and cursed her murderer at her
bedside yet she lets herself be fooled
in the same way by a whelp of the same
breed

  i nodded

   seems like it doesnt it

   and the worst of the business is
that we cannot afford to interfere or
antagonize her just at present

  campbell rang for his man who had
the face of a greek god and the accent
of a cockney

   pack one of my suit-cases at once
and go to the grand central station
and take a ticket for anywhere except

boston when you go out carry the
bag so that my initials will be plainly
seen stay away three or four days
you understand 

   yes sir without emotion

   when you get down-stairs you
neednt hurry about it a trolley will
do

   yes sir

   tell vail to get out the car and
drive to the van huysens and wait
for me there let me know when you
are ready to go
i es sir

  the valet departed and i looked to-
ward campbell for an explanation

   just a minute he said absently
and went to the telephone again and
getting the connection he wanted
called very quietly

 hello crowley yes is he
still asleep that doesnt matter let
him whine but if he makes too much
noise gag him any one hanging
about outside well i fancy they are
there just the same good-by

  as he rose i was impelled to ask
 how the deuce do you keep com-
mand of these people 

   organization-good pay-safety
-fear of what rebellion means-the
power of money-and these

  he held out his great hands clenched
and there was no denying the brute in-
fluence of them

   i never preach the twaddle of up-
lifting the masses he continued
 let fifth avenue and berkeley
square stay where they are they
would be out of place in hells kitchen
or whitechapel and would maybe
only make them worse than they are

   its only the unfortunates who
cannot help themselves out of perpetual
poverty and sickness and tears that i
bother with the others are living the
lives the lord gave them-and if
theyre no very bonny it canna be
laid to your door or mine

   as for my crew they know that
i have money theyve seen its power
and sheltered themselves behind its
capabilities the machinery of the law

cant be set in motion by the poor it
costs too much the seedy plaintiff is
sneered at the minute he appears jus-
tice like any commodity is bought and
paid for

   that varelli woman had sense
enough to remember that this morning
she did not recognize me simply be-
cause she forgot her hatred to remem-
ber that i am her only hope of de-
fense her life hasnt held much for
which to be thankful and if that beast
of a husband of hers dies the least she
can expect is a life sentence - if we
dont buy some justice for her i
must run down and see my friend
seton tait about it hes rather clever
in affairs of that sort

  he went to the window and i fol-
lowed him and saw parkss man still
in evidence

   whats your idea in sending your
man out of town  i asked

   watch

  the valet came in said he was ready
and was told to depart at once

  we stood at the window studying
the hat and shoulders and presently
saw the valet appear carrying a suit-
case with r m c marked in white
upon it

  the hat and shoulders became sud-
denly animated and resolved them-
selves into a man of large proportions
who carefully followed the suit-case on
board a trolley

   that means there are two of
them campbell declared  and the
other if i had my car brought here
wouldnt bother hiring a taxi to fol-
low me unless you were with me nowr
of course he thinks we are going to
separate and that i shall follow the
suit-case the man we dont see will
follow you

   me  

   youre a suspicious character
the police blotter says so and parks
thinks you are much more so but our
friend down-stairs only thinks he will
follow you when i walk out of here
and stroll across the park to the van
huysens he will know that i am not

going to walk to anywhere that my
valet needs a trolley-car to reach he
will flounder about for half a minute
or so wishing there were two of him
and then-he will follow me across the
park to the van huysens five min-
utes later you will leave here and go
up to dellas that is her address

  he scribbled the number upon a
card and i took it blankly

   and then what  

   stay there till nine - thirty this

evening then come down to -th

street della will give you margarets
jewelry and you may bring it down
with you you cant very well go back
to your hotel - at least not comfort-
ably the management would prob-
ably tell you to pay your bill and get
out dont forget five minutes after
i leave followed by his nibs down-
stairs you skip up-town the trolley
passing here will take you almost to
the door

  i agreed blindly because he held the
key to my future and there was nothing
else to do

  standing by the window after he
had left me i saw him stride forth
and -walk directly across the street to
stroll leisurely toward the nearest park
entrance

  a taxi crawled into view and after
him

  campbell turned into the park and
some one got out of the taxi and fol-
lowed it was all very obvious-when
pointed out beforehand

  then the telephone bell shrilled

chapter xxix

quite unexpected

  tiie sound startled me and for a
minute i did not know whether to an-
swer or not while i was considering
it rang again more insistently

  proving how i felt toward it i ac-
tually approached on tiptoe and gin-
gerly taking up the receiver called
quietly

   hello 
a thieves comedy



   theres your party a sharp
feminine voice answered and a small
carefully modulated one asked in-
stantly 

   hello mr campbells apart-
ment  

   who is speaking please  

   margaret this is mr mason
isnt it 

   good morning how did rou
know i was here  

   saw you and mr campbell go up
im only half a dozen doors away i
saw mr campbell go out so i thought
perhaps youd come up and let me
apologize properly theres nothing to
be afraid of papas gone out of town
you know the number

  of course but-

   then it shouldnt be very difficult
good-by

  and she was gone leaving me in a
most unpleasant quandary

  if i did not accept her invitation she
would very likely be displeased if i
did i should disobey campbells orders

  i think that settled it that ajicl a
desire to be assured that she was not
badly hurt her voice did not sound
as if she had been but the evidence
wasnt altogether satisfactory and
campbells attitude of proprietorship
over her rankled

  there was little or no hesitation
after that

  wrhen i got down into the street
had looked carefully around and could
find no trace of anything that looked
like a detective i could see no danger
in delaying my trip up-town fifteen
minutes or so

  there was a policeman at the corner
but he paid no attention to me as i
passed and i reached the rollins
apartment without any bother

  of course i was a little dubious
about encountering margarets maid
but since she had never seen me she
was not likely to know that it had been
i to whom she had spoken on the tele-
phone

  a jap butler took me for granted
and showed me into the drawing-room

  there was no one there and not an-
other servant in sight so i made my-
self comfortable in a very roomy chair
which made me sit with my back to
some hangings that blotted out another
room

  gluing my attention upon the door
i waited possibly half a minute and
then a soft hand from behind my chair
went over my eyes and another over
my mouth choking off an exclamation
of surprise

    s-h 

  i felt a thrill go through me that
raced down to my boots and reach-
ing up i caught both hands and pulled
their owner into view

  she made me gasp

  her cheeks were not even a little
pale and there wasnt the slightest
evidence of a wound leaning away
from me crimson-cheeked and laugh-
ing she looked stunning in the pinkish
silk thing she wore and there was
something of the taxicab mood in her
face that attitude which declared she
wasnt a bit afraid of me when she
got me alone

   i want to apologize for not keep-
ing this mornings engagement she
said  mr campbell thought wed
better postpone it for a day or so

  oh that was it and you put
me off simply to please campbell 

    i didnt 

   seems very much like it i per-
sisted deliberately remembering with
a twinge what campbell had said

  she studied me queerly for a little
while as if she were trying to under-
stand exactly what i meant

  does it matter she asked and
her eyes grew softer than i had ever
seen them

    well isnt it usual to consult the
man you are going to marry first 

  yes - i suppose it is but mr
campbell thought-

  i relinquished her hands and she
stopped abruptly looking very much
surprised but she did not move away
and i scrutinizing the pattern of the
carpet said


the all-story magazine

   and what mr campbell thinks is
more important than what i think
how did you know i should like to be
put off youre going- to marry me
you know-not him

  margarets face was a study

   youre angry  

   not a bit

   you are

   i simply want to be understood
thats all

   but i dont understand yester-
day you were so different so splen-
did and now you look as if you
wanted to pick a quarrel

   i simply object to having our ar-
rangements interfered with by out-
siders no one else has a right to
postpone-

  you mean mr campbell

   he or any one else just as i will
be prepared to protect you from your
father i hope to be able to get mar-
ried and live happily ever after with-
out any outside assistance judging
by this apparently unwarranted post-
ponement i may expect campbell to
hold the reins afterward too and
here and now i may as well lodge an
emphatic objection to that campbell
is all very well in his way but-

   dont you dare to say anything
against mr campbell 

  she went white in a second her
eyes were burning and her little hands
so tightly clenched i could see the
knuckles shining through

  i got to my feet before i knew it
and faced her wanting to kiss the
hardness from her little mouth yet
tugged back by pride or jealousy or
pique

   very well we wont discuss the
gentleman but i think before we
proceed further in our intentions that
you had better be sure of whom you
are marrying and why i dont want
to feel that you married me because
campbell said to

  the anger passed ou-t of her eyes
and her head dropped she looked
down at her hands and fumbled with
a ring

  if he told you not to you wouldnt
would you 

  no answer and no movement save
the twirling of the ring

   he was the beginning and the end
of this wasnt he you simply obeyed
orders thought it was rather roman-
tic and an easy way out of something
that would be just a little more hateful
and that wouldnt let you defy your
father wasnt that it 

  still no answer

   i dont think you quite realize
what you were going to do and i sup-
pose ive been a bit of a fool too to
think that it was possible upon so short
notice i think we gave that bob dol-
liver - lady alice precedent too much
weight she didnt run away because
some one told her to she did it be-
cause she loved the man and if i didnt
like you as much as i do i wouldnt-

  her head came up slowly

  good heavens  what eyes

  they went through and through me
-electrified me-made me tingle from
head to foot

   do you think if-if i didnt-

  she stopped and i thought she was
going to fall at any rate i caught
her as she lurched toward me and held
her too

  a sob was smothered in the folds of
my jacket and i stood like a sheep
feeling like a brute wondering if it
would do any good if i kissed her

  i tilted her face up and i wonder
how many men have seen a woman
look as she did then

  try as i will i cant explain it

  only one woman ever seems like
that to one man the rest may imi-
tate-but as margarets arms came up
like those of a tired child and went
softly about my neck as her mouth
formed my name but did not utter it
as i bent my head and felt the warmth
of her lips i knew that campbell was
a mere incident

  i felt peculiarly quiet and for a
little while we gazed at each other as
if it were the only thing in the world
worth doing
a thieves comedy



  then the color flooded back into her
cheeks and her face found refuge on
my shoulder again

  i looked over her head toward the
hangings and saw the tips of some
ones fingers disappear

chapter xxx

one thing after another

  my arms grew limp all the ardor
of their embrace dying oiit of them as
i stared at the place where the fingers
had been i thought i heard the swish
of skirts as margaret startled by my
sudden lack of enthusiasm looked up

   whats wrong  she whispered
drawing away from me

   nothing its all right thought
i heard some one coming thats all

  i led her to the chair i had occupied
and she perched herself upon the arm
of it wonderingly trying to read the
riddle in my expression

   you look as if you had seen a
ghost she told me as i sat down
 and you are quite as white as one

  i put my arms about her quite sur-
prised at my temerity and kissed her
again and again just to keep her from
asking questions of course that was
not the only reason

  still i sensed to whom those van-
ishing fingers had belonged and had
no wish to create a rumpus by telling
margaret anything about them camp-
bell had likened the maid in the rollins
household to a powder-mine t had no
desire to make the spark that would
blow it up

  doubtless the peeping maid had seen
what i looked like and the situation
as she could view it was to say the
least  rich

  fortunately margaret accepted the
kisses in full explanation

  margarets eyes were clear and smi-
ling when i left her and i felt that
nothing mattered so long as we two
understood each other and were con-
tent

but i boarded an up-town tram with

a sensation that i had put my foot in
it - the general situation  mean -
and i prayed that miss powder-mine
was as careful as she apparently was
mercenary it would not pay her to
tell ralph of my visit he would only
raise the dickens and she would get
into trotible with campbell but i
would have much preferred that she
had not seen me-like that

  the thing bothered me all the way
up-town and when i left the tram i
walked in a sort of brown study try-
ing to imagine the effects my disobe-
dience to orders might have and then
jumping aside to avoid a little fellow
on a small tricycle i saw a familiar
figure clothed in something dark and
clinging standing on the bottom step
at the entrance to dellas apartment

  she was looking in the opposite di-
rection toward the elevated railway
station and before i had time to de-
cide whether to be seen or not she had
stepped down and was walking away

  alice

  at first i thought that i had made
a mistake it seemed preposterous that
alice should know anything about
della or the gobbler but as i walked
toward the apartment entrance i real-
ized that i had stumbled upon one
more queer twist in an affair that was
already contorted sufficiently to make
any ones head buzz

  i rang dellas door - bell timidly
and the door was jerked open and
della appeared before me in the semi-
darkness of the hall with a suddenness
that was truly startling

  what ye want she rasped at
me instantly and then recognizing
me her voice dropped to a militant
mumble oh its you is it i
guess i gotta let you in if she says so
shes the boss

  there was a sneer mingled with her
grumbling and as i entered thorough-
iy bewildered she closed the door be-
hind me with a spiteful bang and a
muttered- makes me sick  

   i dont understand i pleaded
moving along the hall


the ale-story magazine

   you cant kid me you wuz wait-
in down-stairs for miss mac to give
you the woid that it wuz all right-s
if itd make any diffrence what i
said she laughed mockingly jus
hang up your kelly an stick roun s
long as you like shes runnin this
dump

  it was borne upon me that  miss
mac  was alice though what her re-
lationship to campbell was puzzled
me della apparently did not enter-
tain high regard for her

  della crept after me into the living-
room she appeared to hesitate about
it and i felt rather than heard her fol-
low

  passing the gobblers bedroom i
saw that the nurse had been reengaged
evidently overruling dellas ideas of
economy and i supposed that was an-
other instance of alices  bossism
though how she had ever become con-
nected with the affair i could only
dimlly conjecture

  as della trailed me into the parlor
which was sandwiched between the
dining-room and another offshoot in-
tended for music or a bed a glance at
her sulky face told me that there was
something on her mind of which she
wanted to be rid

   youre one of macs real swell
pals aint you   she demanded sul-
lenly

   i suppose so

   whatd he sen you up here for 

   i am not going to remain long
just till this evening

  she looked me over very carefully

   what did miss mac tell you about
the kid  

   why nothing

   dont try to make a monkey outa
me an if youve come up here to
get a line on how i treats the noice to
give mac an earful ill slam you one
get me 

  her shoulders drooped to an ugly
slouch in direct contrast to her chic
pearl-gray dress the curl of her up-
per ilip made her almost brutal

  i made no comment evidently she

had acquired an entirely wrong con-
ception of the reason for my being
there and i did not suppose i could
disillusion her

  suddenly she swung round and
flung this at me

   you think i aint in macs class
don you im tough an fresh an
ignrant oh im wise i know what
i am an what you an miss mac
thinks an mebbe i aint got no right
to hold him to nuthin but im gon-
na jus the same a pause as she
caught her breath sharply  she ain
gonna get him  

  there was an awkward silence
apparently i had dropped in at a
moment when dellas mind ached for
relief from the struggle to be some-
thing she knew very welil she was not
and she seemed to imagine that i
knew a great deal more about it than
i did one thing was certain  miss
mac  was not supposed to be camp-
bells  sister so i presumed she
might be his  cousin

   dont you think you are allowing
your antipathy to miss - er - miss
mac to carry you too far 

  instantly dellas slouch became
more pronounced and judging by the
sudden flashing of her eyes i wished
i had not spoken she studied me in-
tently for fully a minute

   you got a noive she declared
finally in a very low voice  what
you buttin in for 

   im not i merely want you to
think-

  think aint i been thinkin for
monts and monts aint i had to
sit by feelin like dirt under her shoes
lisnin to her fif avenoo chatter
knowin he wuz daffy abou it an get-
tin hail columbia frm him cos i
couin get on to being a lady wen
he foist came nosin roun the kitchen
i thought he wuz a god or somethin
an wen he saved beans from the
chair-

  the chair you mean-

   sure beans didn have nuthin
to doin with it but theyd ha put him
a thieves comedy



away if mac hadn ha butted in wit
the coin for a cracker jack lawyer what
proved a alibi crabbe an paler an
gregg an the whole gangs been
helped out the same way-

  i nodded with a clearer understand-
ing of the rob roy gangs beginnings

  i did not speak thinking it better
to allow her to get the venom out of
her system in her own way some
one moving about in the hall entered
one of the bedrooms and when a door
closed della eyed me militantly and
asked as if she were daring me to
deny it

   shes crazy about him aint she

  you mean miss mac

  sure

   why no i dont think so

  aw - tell it to sweeney her
shes daffy abou him an she
makes a bluff about wantin the gob-
bler to get all thats coinin to him
aven shed put dope in his milk if
shed get away with it why say
that night in passaic wen my sister
died she argued with mac to beat the
ban about him havin -no right to keep
his woid to nessie bout lookin out
for the gobbler an keepin him frm
being brung up in the kitchen

   she said me or the kids dad wuz
his nacheratl guardian an that the
lawr didnt give mac no right to take
him away frm us but wen mac
shut his face tight an says he had a
dooty to get by wit lawr or no lawr
she closed up like a clam an didn t say
another woid

   but starch aint whitern she wuz
wen mac come acrost to me an ast
me to help him give the kid a chanst

  she had made that night at passaic
painfully clear and i could under-
stand that campbells position had
been peculiar

  he had been unable to bring rol-
linss duty and rights as parent upon
the situation because that meant re-
vealing his identity and endangering
the life of margarets father nor
could he break his promise to the
childs mother without casting mar-

garets half-brother forever into
heaven knows what

  alice had plainly shown that she
had been less eager to protect her
uncles worthless hide  i was quite
sure when she pointed out who the
childs natural guardians were that
she did not intend campbell to think
that she meant that della was the least
of two evils

  and he quixotic idiot that he was
taking up rollinss burden and keep-
ing his promise to protect the baby
from its mothers hereditary environ-
ment had set his face toward the mid-
dle course and proposed the ridicu-
lous union with della as the simplest
way out

  you gonna be roiur to-night

  the query startled me from a rev-
erie in which a thought had come to
me

  yes till nine-thirty

   ill give you them sparks jimmys
sendin over fore you leave i gotta
a lady frien cornin to see me roun
nine shes grabbed a swell feller
somewheres an wants to give him an
airin an show me up a short
forced laugh mocked the assertion  i
guess i don needa lose any sleep abou
that

  she walked slowly away from me
toward the portieres in every line and
movement what heredity had made
her the flapping of the hangings be-
hind her was no more listless than she

  it was plain that her passion for
mac did not give her any false ideas
about the future with him

  i went to a restaurant for lunch
and when i returned learned from the
nurse that miss borrowman had gone
out

  taking a peep at the gobbler i saw
that he was dull-eyed and listless and
mentioning the fact to the nurse was
informed that he had been  nearly
poisoned with sour milk  - that he
was a little better and that all miss
borrowman knew about the care of
babies was to pet them and give them
paregoric when they cried


the all-story magazine

  i also learned that  miss macgre-
gor  had reengaged her and told her
she must not leave again no matter
what miss borrowman said and that
the maid had threatened to leave be-
cause the nurse had blamed her for
feeding the child bad milk

  all of which doubtless was the
cause of the rumpus and of dellas
spitfire mood on my arrival

  that afternoon plodded -on toward
evening keeping me in a continual
state of unrest wondering what
campbell wanted with me at the musty

--th street house i did not

care for the arrangement at all pictur-
ing as i did dark shapes of men lurk-
ing about outside dim lights inside
and people going about on tiptoe
speaking in whispers with somewhere
up-stairs rollins probably bound and
gagged waiting for whatever camp-
bells ingenious mind had in store for
him

  della returned sometime before
dark and gave me as wide a berth as
the place would allow

  getting back from the luxury of a
shave and a leisurely dinner about a
quarter of nine the maid let me in
and i ambled through to the parlor to
waste half an hour or so guessing by
the light in dellas room that she was
dressing to receive her visitors

  i hoped she would not drag me into
the reception and bethought me of the
room adjoining the parlor as a means
of escape if mv hostess did not ap-
pear and give me margarets trinkets
beforehand

  presently as i trifled with a stray
volume of browning a door opened
and closed and i heard the rustle of
silken skirts come along the hall and
through the dining-room

  a small hand threw back the por-
tieres and della appeared

  della-but different i stared at her
in amazement

  framed in the deep red hangings
clothed in a semidecolletee gown that
clung to her supple young figure glit-
tering fires flashed from out of her

wonderful hair about her throat her
wrists and her fingers

  she was wearing margarets jew-
elry 

chapter xxxi

borrowed plumes

  i started to my feet partly in as-
tonishment but greatly in admiration

  there was still a hint of contempt in
her deep-blue eyes

   some class to this rig 

   good heavens you mustnt wear
those-those things 

   aw-g-wan 

  she came from between the portieres
and rustled toward the center of the
room moving with perfect ease and
grace

   you can bet your life im gonna
wear em fanny ain gonna put nuth-
in acrost on me wit them sparks lyin
roun loose

  she turned about and looked over
her shoulder to get the back view in
the long panel mirror

   fits close don it guess if i kep
my face shut you wouldn know me
frm a reglar f i f  avenoo dame
fannys onv cornin in for a minit jus
to let me lamp her new beau fore him
an her goes joy-ridin somewheres so
you needn worry youll get the
sparks in time nough

  realizing the futility of objection
and since i could not take the jewels
without personal violence i sat down
again watching the iridescent flashes
come out of her jet-black hair

  there was a diamond-studded brace-
let and one of plain gold upon her right
wrist upon her left was an odd
chainlike affair with a diamond-set
clasp the necklace set her throat on
fire a brooch like a star twinkled
upon her left shoulder and her fingers
sparkled with the assistance of several
rings

  as she moved toward a chair ap-
parently quite satisfied that her friend
fanny would receive the proper sort
a thieves comedy



of shock the door-bell rang rather
more loudly than was necessary

  della wheeled toward the portieres
with the injunction

   sit tight nobody ain gonna bite
you

  some one-the maid i presumed-
answered the ring and the outer door
opened and closed footsteps and
voices sounded in the hall and della
went to meet them through the dining-
room

   hello fanny i heard her call
presently -  come right in  i gotta
frien o macs here but hes harmless

  an empty laugh answered and then 

  gee aint you swell you look
like stiffanvs  prade meet my
frien mr brown mr brown-miss
borrowman

   pleased to meet you della ac-
knowledged and mr brown mumbled
something in reply

  followed a strange silence

  the portieres shut it out and i sat
for fully a minute waiting and wonder-
ing what the dickens was wrong

   come right in della insisted
again and her voice had become sud-
denly subdued  y got pleny
time

   i g-uess wed better be on our way

o	j

fanny protested just as della threw
back the hangings revealing a rather
striking blond who was eying her
hostess suspiciously  me an my
friens got a date up the river an--
my gawd 

  fannys exclamation died away in a
whisper

  her rouged lips parted foolishly
and her eyes spoke more eloquently
than her tongue

  she gaped at me as if i were a ghost

  and i gaped back at her and over
her shoulder at her  swell feller

  he was ralph van huysen

  instantly i felt icy cold then unpleas-
antly warm and immediately cold
again

  ralph hat in hand looked stupid
and for a moment i thought he was
going to turn and run what little color

he had died out of his cheeks his jaw
sagged and he shrank behind fanny
as if he thought she ought to protect
him

  margarets maid-and i had no
doubt upon the question of fannys
identity - seemed undecided about
what course to take whether to stand
or fly and della with margarets
jewels screaming out all over her
looked from one to the other of us

  it was an impossible situation

  ralph was afraid of me because i
knew of his engagement to margaret
and i was afraid of him because of
the jewelry della wore and what fanny
had seen that morning when i had dis-
obeyed campbells orders and called on
margaret before coming up to dellas

  fanny was the enigma-the powder-
mine i could not imagine what she
thought or would be likelyr to do

  whats hit ye della demanded
in bewilderment

   nuthin dearie fanny replied
weakly but drew nearer to her hostess
with her attention fixed upon the tiara
in dellas hair  you jus dazzled us
thats all them sparks-

  her voice trailed away and her eyes
narrowing to pin-points shifted to the
necklace then with lightninglike swift-
ness to the odd chain bracelet with the
diamond-set clasp on dellas left wrist

   gee  she breathed and her gaze
swinging slowly and heavily upon me
remained

  you-you-

  perhaps the rush of circumstantial
evidence choked the rest of it and for
a moment i thought she was going to
spring at me her eyes said quite
plainly what she meant

  they seemed to draw the cold beads
of perspiration out upon my forehead
and make my knees shake as i slid into
my chair to avoid the accusation and
the knowledge in her face and glanced
quickly past her toward ralph

  he did not move or speak but he
was studying della in an oxlike fash-
ion queer i heard him mutter

   say whats the matter wit


the all-story magazine

youse   della demanded coarsely
 youre lookin at mes if-- if i
hadnt nuthin on

  her hands went up instinctively to
hide her throat while the color
flooded into her cheeks

  ralph got a better view of the brace-
lets i could see at once that they
startled him more than the other
things his eyes widened in unbelief
and he moved an impulsive step to-
ward della and stopped

   what the devil  he cried hoarse-
ly and the rest of what he was going
to say died in an incoherent mumble
as fanny slowly turned her head

   don get mad she cautioned
 that won do no goad

   hang it all  ralph sputtered
 arent they margarets 

   i guess so fanny interrupted
with terrible precision

   whats took youse  della broke
in sharply lowering her hands from
her throat her face now cloudy and
threatening  you seen macs frien
before or what  

   i guess i have somewheres fan-
ny replied her upper lips curling  an
nioren that too hes rotten he is
makin love to a sweet goil an pinchin
her sparks to hand em out to-to-
she did not finish it but a bomb
bursting over dellas head could not
have startled her more and her ex-
pression would have been comical but
for the lurking antagonism in it she
turned to me for an explanation

   whats she mean  

   sure ask him fanny taunted
 ask macs frien why say when
mac hears o this hell throw you both
out on your heads i didnt think you
was like that della an after all mac
done for you too

  dellas- mouth opened but behind
that momentary stupidity there rushed
a storm of passionate and savage re-
sentment whipped forward by the pity
in fannys tone and expression

   what-what you tryin to-to-
insinuate  

  nothin dearie jus advisin you

not to get too gay with pinched sparks
thats all my frien don wanna start
a muss if there aint no occasion
your frien that little shrimp

i thought you wuz past cradle snatch-
ing  

  fanny bit her lip and as far as her
rouge would allow went quite white

  what the deuce is this ralph
broke in and with lightninglike change
of mood swung angrily upon his com-
panion  a trick youve played on
me  bringing me here to be made a
fool of wrhats mason doing here
and-and those jewels

   dont scrap in here della inter-
rupted her mouth ugly in a sneer

 i didn think genlemen talked like
that to a lady guess your fellow ain
so swell as you cracked him up to be
fanny

    shut up  fanny snapped wheel-
ing furiously upon her hostess  you
think because you got your hooks on
mac that you are somethin do you
know why he promised to marry you
he was sore-thats why-because
miss alice wouldnt agree with him
when he spilled that chatter about the
nachural guardian hookin up with the
appointed guardian sos the gobblerd
get wot was cornin to him he was
lookin at her like a guy with a tooth-
ache hopin shed kick she called his
bluff though and now hes making
good and thats why youre here with
stolen sparks and her old clothes you
dont figure in the game-really

  with her head drawn down between
her shoulders della did not stir i saw
her wince as the lashes of truth wound
bitingly round her quivering heart

  some one moved in the hall stopped
and did not go away

  ralph stood dazed shifting his at-
tention from fanny to della while i
sat in a stupefied lethargy perspiring
at every pore yet feeling a chill creep
over me as fanny swung upon me

   why don you say somethin you
boob she demanded her bosom
heaving with resentment at being at-
tacked by both ralph and della
a thieves comedy



 youre a peach of a frien of macs
you are pinchin a sweet goils joolry
to hand em out to a low-down little-

  a smothered sob and a sound that
was half a screech half a curse burst
from dellas lips as she sprang

  i saw the glittering myriad of lights
dancing out of her inky-black hair--
saw her rage-distorted face - then
ralph spring between her and her
prey

  fanny screamed and clutched at his
shoulder but he succeeded in grabbing
dellas wrists and held her off though
she struggled like a wildcat

   lemme go  she gasped hoarsely
wrenching her right arm free and doing
her best to scratch ralphs eyes out

  but ralph held on even when i
caught dellas arms from behind and
tried to calm her and draw her away

  he was studying the chain bracelet

  he found and sprang the clasp and
slipping the bracelet from her arm
jumped backward della struggled
and writhed in my grasp with fiendish
energy drawing sobbing breaths of a
fury that was dangerous

  i thought so ralph exclaimed
wheeling upon fanny i gave this
bracelet to miss rollins last year our
initials are on it i suppose all the other
stuff that little fiend is wearing is mar-
garets too

  dellas struggles ceased with surpri-
sing suddenness

  fanny laid her hand upon ralphs
arm as if to smooth his temper

  don get mad shell give em up
and-

   go to the deuce  ralph snapped
jerking his arm free  you and your
confounded friends a crowd of
thieves thats what i wouldnt be
surprised if you helped take the things

   and whats all that talk about
alice what alice hang it all
you dont mean to say that my sister
is mixed up in anything like this
confound you ive a good mind
to-

  an unpleasant laugh from fanny
halted him her eyes burned and

there was a dangerous set to the thin
red lines of her lips

  iin a thief - eh her voice
was threatening low  you have
the nerve to say that if i was as low
as you are id take arsenic i guess
you thought you were foolin me -
didn you youd marry me

  another unpleasant laugh made
ralph wince and back away a step

   sure youd marry me oh sure
you would-not youd hand me the
same deal as your uncle - rollins --
handed nessie borrowman you an
him are a pair youre both rotten
but hes gettin his an ive played
you for the dog you are and now im
through get that through
ralph was white and trembling as
fanny sneered at him and ran her eyes
over him with all the contempt in the
world

  but i only saw that dimly out of
the corner of my eye as i watched
della get slowly out of her chair she
had not missed a word

  rollins it was hardly a whis-
per  rollins ruined my sister an
you knew 

  their eyes met and for a second
or two there was fear of what she had
done in fannys dellas glowed and
her arms were quite rigid the fat
was in the fire with a vengeance

   rollins  della repeated hoarsely
 the guy that mac-

  her head came round slowly and i
flinched before the look she gave me

  she did not continue there was no
need she knew that the man who
had accompanied me to the clachan
was named rollins and summing up
the case against me reminded me si-
lently of the promise i had made her
the night she and i had met and of
how i had kept it

  the silence was broken by a childs
cry

  in a moment the tiara flashed
through space to my feet and as i
stooped to pick it up a bracelet struck
my hand the rest followed ere any
of us had a chance to get our breath


the all-story magazine

and when the brooch struck me a little
under the left eye i hoped there wasnt
any more

  there was a rush of rustling skirts

  i straightened and turned about
with a hazy conception of ralph being
very near to me della rushing through
the dining-room and fanny suddenly
timid and anxious following her

  some one in the hall moved hastily
and a door closed della did not seem
to heed i heard her rushing to the
other end of the hall another door
slammed and the gobbler wailed
louder and longer

  ralph was very pale and shaking
with anger and excitement his hands
were clenched

  mine were filled with rings and
bracelets and the brooch the tiara
and necklace were in my pockets

  give me those things he de-
manded

   are they yours  

   they belong to my cousin

   ill see that your cousin gets
them

   you-you- hang you  

  he lunged at me and with my
hands filled as they were i could only
throw up my arms to ward him off and
side-step

  i backed into a small table-upset
it a vase crashed to the floor and i
went with it when ralph crazy as a
malay and swearing between his teeth
plunged at me catching me off my
balance with a terrific swing over the
left eye

  my head was swimming and the
electric chandelier whirling round
and something hard and sharp came
up from behind and the lights grew
dim

  in an instant a weight pressed upon
my chest and when i struggled feebly
to rise the weight grew heavier there
was nothing distinct

  millions of miles above me i saw a
faint light and from far off came a
childs cry

  a long time afterward the weight
upon my chest lifted and some one

flung something wet in my face
grabbed my arm and pulling me to
my feet held me there till the mists
before my eyes faded and i saw that
she was fanny

   are you a friend o macs 

  i nodded

  do you know where rollins is

    i think so

   then for heavens sake wake up 
an get a move on or therell be mur-
der this night dellas gone for beans
borrowman

chapter xxxii

number 

  the next few minutes are very
hazy

   gone for beans borrowman 

  that threat roused me as nothing
else could have done made my bruised
eye the growing lump on the back of
my head and the fact that ralph had
taken advantage of his opportunity to
flee with the jewelry matters of sec-
ondary importance

  it all lay somewhere behind the
shadow that beans and his revenge
cast across the pathway of events

  i could see the rob roy gang torn
asunder the blot of murder upon its
escutcheon its members scattered and
fleeing from the clutching fingers of
the law its leader-

  i rushed to the telephone and stood
upon a red-hot griddle while the oper-
ator took centuries to get me the
number i wanted a gruff voice an-
swered my query

   mac aint got here yet

   hasnt got there 

   naw  ring off

  then because there was nothing
else to do and because inactivity was
the one thing i simply could not stand

i got into my hat and coat and out of
the apartment to find a taxicab to take

me to the-th street house

  i dont know what fanny did or
where she went or anything about her
as i went out i had a dim vision of
a thieves comedy



the nurse and the maid hovering about
the hall

  della had about ten minutes start
and before i had found a taxi she had
been given ten more but i knew she
had to find beans while i was travel-
ing directly to the rendezvous that
was the only comfort i had as the
cab doing its best to earn the bribe i
offered pounded on down-town

  seated alone with nothing to do but
watch the lights flash past i had time
to paint pictures that were hideous
revolting and terrible

  the end was inevitable i felt it in
my bones even though i might pre-
vent the coming of the crisis that
night and i shivered when i thought
i might be too late

  i could not imagine even though i
did arrive in time to warn campbell
of his danger how he was going to
get rollins safely out of the house if
it were being watched by parkss men
yet moved he must be or else the
blood-seeking beans would kill him

  stopping the taxi a square away
from the house i hastened down
ninth avenue feeling anything but
brave

  at -th street i hesitated for a

minute searching the shadows fear-
ful of the avengers approach then
with an effort turned and went swift-
ly toward eighth avenue

  the lamps were not very bright
the atmosphere was heavy and sinister

  yet the place was not so somnolent
after all

  i heard a piano and some one who
could not play the cornet was demon-
strating the fact

  young people flirted upon the bot-
tom steps of the houses matrons gos-
siped under a lamp across the street
and a lady in a kimono leaning out of
a first - floor window held frivolous
conversation with a man anxious late
as it was that she occupy the vacant
seat in the little red car drawn up at
the carriage-step

  there were two taxicabs further up
the street near campbells place i

walked tremblingly toward them with
my eyes about me and i concluded
that some sort of merrymaking was
going on in the house before which
they stood

  every room in the place from the
basement to the roof was ablaze and
a few curious people stood on the side-
walk apparently waiting for some-
thing to happen

  the house next it in grim contrast
was devoid of light and life i felt
ashamed and afraid of my connection
with it i dreaded to pass the welcome
homelike place-so fearlessly bespeak-
ing its law-abidingness-to dive like
a felon into the shadow of campbells
basement

  i hoped the bright lights were not
just next door and i peered at the
numbers of the houses i was passing
to learn just how far i had to go

   no  -the next was not very
distinct-but i could trace a six in the
one after and presumed it was 

  i stopped there

  no  was campbells number
and that was the house with the lights

  the number painted slantwise upon
the glass panels of the door glared
at me

  great guns a detective standing
at the eighth avenue corner half a
square away could easily have picked
me out of that glare particularly if i
attempted to climb the stairs to the
main door

  i could not imagine any one impris-
oned there and as i hesitated trying
to believe that i had not got the num-
bers mixed it occurred to me that rol-
lins had gone

  a wave of relief swept over me
and remembering how different the
clachan had been on my second visit
i plunged into the basement

  a light foot sounded within answer-
ing my ring at the door - bell the
door swung open and in the semidark-
ness i saw a white shirt-front glisten
then indistinctly the face of a man
with a small black mustache

   well  


the all-story magazine

   is this cam-macgregors place
   it is what ya want 

   im mason i have an appoint-
ment-

   i guess not try the door up-
stairs

  dont he an idiot is macgreg-
or here yet  

  heavy feet were coming along the
hall and a womans strident voice
called 

  whats the trouble billy

   theres a party here-

  a mass of straw-colored hair and
the ample proportions of rosie paler
pounded into view

   gee  blondy 

  then in a moment my hopes raced
to the skies and i knew that i was first
in the race for rollinss life

  as  hurriedly stepped inside she
whispered

   its all right billy beat it

  billy mumbled to himself and reluc-
tantly departed rosie grabbed my
arm and led me along the hall and past
the dining-room but not before i
caught a gilimpse of a table with a
snowy-white cloth much silver and
glassware and flowers as if for a
feast

  where you been rosie whis-
pered  its fifteen after ten

    is it  

   sure it is if it weren that miss
mac wuz late too youd be in dutch
an whatd ye come in the basement
way for you aint groceries beat
it-heres the stairs

  gently but firmly she pushed me
ahead and i climbed the narrow flight
wondering what new insanity camp-
bell was practising reaching the
top i looked round the baluster and
along the fully lighted hall to the front
door there wasnt a soul in sight
but some one with a deep voice was
talking in the parlor

   hes in there isnt he

   sure go right in hell be glad
to see ya then looking into my
bruised face in the better light  gee
what a shiner 

  clapping her hands over her mouth
to smother her laughter she thrust
me toward the parlor portieres with
the other

  i threw the hangings aside took
one step into the room and-

  alice van huysen was there
campbell was not

  he of the sonorous voice was a
clergyman

  my good eye blinked the other
could not because it wasalmost closed
alice started to her feet but the min-
ister regarded me with careful disap-
proval

  outside i heard rosie paler ma-
king great haste toward the stairs
laughing and as she went up another
flight two orthree steps at a time i
had a suspicion regarding the where-
abouts of campbell

  somehow or other i could not say
anything or think for a minute or so
i must have looked stupid and wild
i know i felt much worse than that

   whats wrong  alice cried
 you look as if-as if-well cant
you see how you look  

  since i was facing the mantel mir-
ror i could see quite plainly and the
sight was not a pretty one

   my left eye as i have said was all-
most closed - puffed up and greenish
blue my mustache was scattered to
the four winds of heaven and my hat
because of the throbbing lump at the
back of my head was tilted sidewise
giving me a truly giddy appearance

   i removed it conscious for the first
time of my wretched manners and
discovered that my hair was disrepu-
tably tousled

  both alice and the minister studied
me queerly in silence the former
threatening to smile the latter with a
measure of embarrassment i opened
my mouth to say something apologetic
heard a footstep on the stairs and
wheeled without a word and went back
into the hall

  ere i had gone three steps i halted
as if some one had caught my coat-
tail and pulled me back on my heels
a thieves comedy

 -

  campbell in a quiet brown busi-
ness suit was descending the stairs
with him was margaret

chapter xxxiii

the clansman

  for a little while i could hardly be-
lieve that they were real

  gradually i saw that margaret
wore something blue with a splash of
gray in it her hand lay lightly upon
campbells arm and while she ap-
peared to cling to him she did not
seem nearly so much put out as i

  rosie paler followed trying to look
very solemn

   hello didderington found a
job yet  

  campbells deep tones of greeting
laughed at me though his expression
was as solemn as an owls then he
and margaret both seemed to under-
stand that there was something
wrong and at closer quarters they saw
my left eye and dishevelment

  margarets hand slipped from her
escorts arm

   what on earth have you been do-
ing campbell demanded midway
between laughter and amazement in
a taxi wreck 

   not quite they know

   tried to make my single eye say
the rest of it but campbell did not
seem to understand

 they know who knows and
what

   beans

  to margaret it must have sounded
idiotic and her expression of doubt
was almost funny campbells eyes
widened a little but that was all

   you mean they know-

  who smith is and where to find
him

  campbell smiled

  i never saw any one smile just like
that it was cruel but the relief in it
was the most surprising thing of all
in fact i hardly believed he quite ap-
preciated just how serious it was

    	s

   bu - but della - shes gone for
him-man to bring him here they
know hes here dont they

  margarets face underwent a hun-
dred changes of expression in a min-
ute she hadnt the faintest idea of
what we were talking about camp-
bells lips merely tightened over that
enigmatical smile and half turning
about said quietly to rosie

   tell billy not to let any one in
until after the minister is gone no
one at all-not even the borrowmans
understand  

   yes sir

   after he leaves it doesnt matter
tell billy that

   i will

  rosie rushed toward the basement
stairway

   come on campbell invited me
without winking an eyelash   just
as you are without one plea your
time has come

  the succeeding minutes - i dont
know how many there were - ought
to be chronicled by some one else

  i know very little about them

  faintly do i recollect standing with
margaret facing the minister mum-
bling responses and hearing my bride
whisper hers i did not see her half
the time because she stood on my left
side and the whole business was just
as hazy as the things i could see out
of my left eye

  alice and campbell and rosie were
somewhere about and i found the ring
in my hand at the proper time without
knowing how it came there

  then after i had kissed margaret
for the first time in public i knew that
we were married the minister said
so and gave us a certificate to prove it
after everybody but rosie had signed
their names

  rosie i benlve was very much sur-
prised and a little awed when she
learned in the course of the ceremony
that i was an earl and when it was all
over i heard her mutter

  gee an i kissed- she
	the all-story magazine

stopped colored and backed away
probably remembering that my wife
was about

  wife

  i could scarcely believe it not even
when campbells hand came out of the
mist and seized mine he looked me
in the eye smiled and growled from
the depths of him

   take good care of her i think
you are both worth it

  then as alice offered her congratu-
lations campbell wrote a check for the
minister who looking askance at me
blessed the whole shooting match and
said he was sorry he could not wait
the women departed up-stairs shortly
after he had gone and hardly had the
hangings fallen behind them ere camp-
bell wheeled with amazing rapidity
toward the sliding doors that shut out
the back parlor

  in an instant they were thrown back

  i stared wide-eyed past campbells
arm motionless gasping for breath
then i laughed i could not help it

  one gas-jet burned low and seated
directly under it were three men

  crabbe was one paler the other

  their solitary eyes gleamed upon the
third and in their right hands each
carried a glistening weapon

  in the center was rollins-gray
with fear and shivering-in kilts

  pie was in full highland costume
even to the cairngorm-hiled dirk in
his sock a silver-mounted cairngorm
thistle-brooch held his flowing plaid in
place and a glengarry was perched at
an approved angle upon his head

  the glaring yellow and red of the
alien tartan seemed to spread all over
him everywhere but over the naked
whiteness of his knees which knocked
together in his terror

  i never saw a man more ludicrous or
so unhappy pie was a study in misery

  paler and crabbe did not smile
their expressions were deadly unemo-
tional

   our friend is now a full-fledged
clansman campbell advised non-
chalantly gripping the edge of the

sliding doors in an idle fashion  he
is armed to the teeth andready to kill
thats what the red in the tartan
means the yellow speaks for itself
and suggests why we prefer his room
to his company

   when we are ready his guardians
shall lead him to the front door which
they shall open for him pie will then
be at perfect liberty to pass out de-
scend the steps and enter a waiting
taxi

  rollins squirmed and found courage
to glare at me his tormentors were
not in the least moved one way or an-
other their calm was terrible

   i believe there are some friends of
his somewhere outside campbell re-
sumed  i cant just say where they
are but mr parks avas at the corner
as i came in if our clansman cares
to walk that far in his present costume
to solicit aid against us we will be
agreeably surprised as it will prove
that he has more courage than we be-
lieved then again as he descends
the steps he may be recognized if
he is we shall submit without a
struggle

  rollins appeared to understand per-
fectly he did not attempt to speak
or to object in any way that sort of
thing had been entirely knocked out
of him all he appeared to care about
was to get into more comfortable rai-
ment

  with an eye upon him and another
upon the portiered entrance of the par-
lor and listening for the ring upon the
door-bell that would herald beanss
arrival i heard campbell continue in
the same easy strain 

   he has our advice upon his move-
ments and actions when he leaves here
and i would like to add that the man
who is looking for smith knows who
smith is and is coming here presently
to look for him

  rollins started an inch or two out
of his chair and his cheeks grew gray
he sagged back again and cowered into
the folds of his plaid

   since silence is generally conceded
a thieves comedy



to mean consent campbell resumed
-relentlessly  it is to be presumed that
he had no objection to the ceremony
he heard performed a few minutes
ago a parents consent is always nice
to have in affairs of that sort pater-
nal generosity is much nicer so he
has kindly assigned to his daughter-
to take effect upon the occasion of her
marriage to - well - anybody - the
mortgages he held upon the estates of
didderington

   the paper was carefully drawn by
that eminent practitioner of law mr
seton tait who arranges legal words
and phrases so that they cant be split
avith an ax our guest signed it feel-
ing that he-might as well-and stayed
to be sure that everything was all
right of course the costume he has
affected for the occasion made him
rather backward about making an ap-
pearance

   and by the way didderington i
believe smith  nelson of broad
street have a few dollars for you
made on the sale of one thousand
shares of rand island at 

  i was dumfounded even rollins
was so startled as to forget his fear
and again rise a few inches out of his
chair and a queer sound half whine
burst from his pallid lips

  but he slid back again instantly and
cringed away from the menacing
touch of his guards revolvers

  campbell eyed him up and down
and seemed to be talking just for the
personal satisfaction of being sure that
rollins would understand exactly what
had happened and how all of his various
plans had failed

   my agents borrowed fifty thou-
sand shares from the gentleman in san
francisco who owned them and gave
security of five million dollars-or
double what the stock was worth
since my guest bought the stuff i cant
return it and of course forfeit the
security but i think that the balance
of what was realized upon the sale of
fifty thousand shares at  should
make a certain very young man inde-

  pendent of his guardians whoever they
may be

  of course i knew that he meant the
gobbler

  he reached out for the other half
of the sliding door rollins had not a
word to say did not make a sound of
any kind

   when i give the word boys not
till then

  crabbe nodded and the door slid
together in a second shutting out the
splash of red and yellow the pallor of
rollinss cheeks and the glint of his
keepers weapons the last glimpse of
the tableau i had was the rakish tilt
of the glengarry upon rollinss head

  campbell gripped my arm and lead-
ing me toward the parlor entrance
said quietly

   when you undertook to play the
market yesterday i phoned smith 
nelson for you telling them to sell
thought you might not know when
but i imagined id like to see if it made
any difference to margaret and you
tell me how it all happened--that eye
and everything it wasnt beans
who-

  the basement bell rang

  ere the sound had died away camp-
bell had reached the sliding doors and
had thrown them back

   quick  youve just a minute 

  crabbe and paler started to their
feet clutched rollinss arms and
hoisted him out of his chair before he
had much of a chance to even gasp

  the basement door closed

  taking charge of his prisoner camp-
bell ordered crabbe and paler to the
main stairs

   the second they show cover
them he finished ominously uncere-
moniously hustling my grotesque and
shrinking father-in-law across the par-
lor out into the hall and toward the
outer door instantly i saw his plan

  as beans and della came in from
below he was sending rollins out from
above it was better under the cir-
cumstances to let the borrowmans in
than keep them out


the all-story magazine

  crabbe and paler took up their po-
sitions on the stairway

  rollinss knees threatened to give
way there was no fight in him and
campbell practically dragged him to
the door though the sound of rushing
feet in the hall below made a chill creep
down my spine

  some one came pounding up the
basement stairs and in the second or
two that i turned my head to see that
crabbe and paler were quite ready for
the intruders a lot of red and yellow
was suddenly pushed out into the
vestibule

  the door closed and campbell
stood with his back to it

  i thought i heard dim sounds of
laughter come from the street but i
may have been mistaken and in any
case i lost them in a sudden growling
command from the stairs 

   put up your hands 

  beans rounding the baluster jerked
back upon his heels almost as if a
bullet from one of the glittering muz-
zles so near his head had actually hit
him

  his dusty face was black as thun-
der and his eyes sweeping about him
like lightning--at me-at campbell-
and up at the men who were so calm
it seemed to hurt-shrank from the
command in their hands

  for just a second he hesitated then
his arms  rose slowly to the accom-
paniment of much unpleasant vitupera-
tive that isnt worth repeating and he
marched in sullen anger at the order
toward the center of the hall followed
by the evil-eyed crabbe

  paler hung back waiting for della
and i thought perhaps she had been
afraid to come up

  crabbe slapping beanss pockets in
the most matter-of-fact fashion ex-
tracted a murderous-looking revolver

   its all right beansy crabbe as-
sured him  mac helped you out
once an im jus helpin him do it
again if you wanna croak the guv
do it where it wont harm nobody but
him an you

  a dull flush crept over beanss face
and forehead campbell with his
hands in his pockets and showing little
signs of perturbation left his post at
the door and came walking leisurely
forward

  crabbe gave him beanss revolver
which he carefully  broke and ex-
tracting the charges handed it back to
its owner just as i caught a suggestion
of millinery and petticoats at the top
of the main stairway and heard with-
out a doubt this time laughter and
jeers come from the street

   not here campbell declared very 
quietly  i dont allow-

 a muffled roar from without
drowned the rest of it and it was fol-
lowed by a shriek that in the dark si-
lences of the nights i hear again and
shudder

  there avas another shot and then
a third

  then a moment of awful quiet that
chilled

  beans smiled

  in an instant with his lips drawn
tightly together and his eyes aflame in
wrath and amazement mingled camp-
bell wheeled sharply to the door and
choking in horrified expectancy fear-
fully glancing toward the stairs i fol-
lowed him

  a screaming riot had risen without

  i was probably a foot behind camp-
bell when he reached the vestibule but
i think he jumped the steps to the side-
walk as windows flew up and heads
popped out and heavy feet and three
heavy men sprang into the limelight
from opposite directions

  midway down the steps i stopped
and looked down in shrinking horror
upon a kilted figure lying huddled and
still beside the open door of a taxicab

  and there was a wild-eyed tousled-
haired girl hysterically screaming at a
stoop-shouldered bearded man who
brandished a smoking revolver

   beat it dad for gawds sake 

  but old man borrowman ignored
the advice instead he stood frothily
daring rollins to get up
a thieves comedy



  rollins did not get up-did not
move

  the yellow and red plaid fluttered a
little that was all

chapter xxxiv

hide and seek

  campbell literally jumped upon
the drunken murderer sending him
against the front wheel of the taxi
and wrenched the revolver from him
as if it were no more dangerous than
the gobblers teething-ring

  then almost brutally pushing della
aside he stooped over rollins

  parks arrived a second later

  ere borrowman recovered his bal-
ance or had gathered any sort of un-
derstanding about what had hit him
one of the other detectives had seized
and handcuffed him the third caught
della from behind  but seemingly un-
decided about how to regard her satis-
fied himself with simply gripping her
arms an attention which peouliarly
enough she made no effort to resist
but stood dumbly watching campbell
and parks bend over rollins

  a third man joined them i learned
later that he was a doctor from across
the street

  there were people racing in upon the
scene from all directions two police-
men forced their way to the center of
activity and one of them instantly
turned about to call an ambulance

  alice dressed to depart was some-
vhere on the steps behind me crabbe
and paler and rosie and beans were
crowded in the vestibule and billy had
come to the basement door but the
vestibule was emptied in a few seconds

  rosie came farther down the steps
the men went the other way  and as i
heard them making themselves scarce
down the basement stairs i felt a small
hand creep into mine and turning my
head sharply found margaret coated
and hatted at my elbow

  in that second right or wrong i
decided that she must not know that

the kilted figure on the sidewalk was
that of her father and subconsciously
i put my arm about her and tried to
lead her back into the house

   lets go inside

   wait she whispered and crept
nearer to me  is he dead 

  as if in reply the doctor bending
over rollins looked up and campbell
and parks straightened slowly and
simultaneously

  they came face to face

  parks nodded toward the thing at
his feet

   in boston eh  

  his voice was quite cold

  campbell ignored the insinuation
completely	

   mebbe yed better tak-this he
suggested broadly and held out -the
murderers revolver  youre a plain-
clathes polisman arent ye 

  parks snatched the weapon angrily
out of campbells hand and a choked-
off scream came from behind them

  della was struggling in her captors
grasp like a mad thing

 youcl trow us down she
screeched  youd trow us to the
bulls 

  parks smiled and waited

  campbell studied the frantic della
for a few seconds then turned and
came leisurely toward the steps

  parks made no move to halt him
he was regarding the prisoners with
an eye to their usefulness just as he
had done mrs varelli that morning

  della quieted instantly the rage
went out of her face as if campbells
look had been a magic wand

  but her father was a different mat-
ter he was partly intoxicated for
one thing and dellas angry screech
had evidently awakened his befuddled
mind to a full understanding of his
position

   trow us to the bulls   he ques-
tioned thickly as if he were repeating
it to know what it meant by the sound
of it

   shut yer face  della snapped

  parks waited a little longer though


the ael-story magazine

it seemed to cause him an effort and
campbell reached the third step of the
stairs as borrowman answering his
daughters advice with an oath raised
his handcuffed hands and pointed an
accusing finger at the gregarach

  you done fr me he exploded
hoarsely as if it had just occurred to
him  you took my gun an trowed
me down more frothy oaths that
allowed campbell to reach the fifth
step ill fix ye ive got your num-
ber  if theyre gonna pull me theyre
gonna pull you-mr rob roy 

  campbell had reached the seventh
step upon a level with margaret alice
and i

   stop 

  parks sprang forward and his right
hand bearing borrowmans revolver
came up sharply

  with a wild scream a small female
figure leaped out of a startled detect-
ives grasp and in a twinkling fast-
ened herself upon parkss right arm
while another who did not scream but
whose cheeks were deathly white
threw herself between campbell and
any bullets that might happen to come
along

   go bob go  

  the words were lost in the roar of
the crowd but i heard a deep laugh
and had a vision of an enormous figure
leaping up the steps and filling the ves-
tibule for a second

   gude nicht-mr polisman  

  and the front door of no 
closed with a bang just as parks free
from dellas hold bounded up the
steps

  confusion

  everything happened in a minute

  there were people everywhere yell-
ing and running and getting in the way
of the detectives and two more police-
men who practically fought their way
into the midst of things

  della recaptured and handcuffed
was turned over to one of them the
other took charge of the frothing bor-
rowman who was screaming to parks 

   grab him mister grab him 

  then parkss two subordinates
joined him with a rush as he was rat-
tling the door at a great rate

  rssie came farther down the steps
grinning

  alice white and anxious came near
to margaret and me and we stood hud-
dled together waiting to see to what
length parks would go we were ig-
nored almost completely probably be-
cause we were mostly ladies and be-
cause parks was after bigger game

  watch the basement he thun-
dered to those below and the basement
door clanged

  no one came out

  there was a crash of breaking glass
as parks smashed the panel of the door
with the butt of the revolver

  in another half minute he had
rushed into the hall followed by the
others all with revolvers drawn ready
for unpleasantness

  not a sound greeted them-nothing

  they became very cautious as if
they thought campbell might be hiding
behind the hat-rack then when they
had poked their heads into the parlor
and the room of rollinss late im-
prisonment they scurried about the
hall at a loss whether to go up or
down

  parks decided to go down and took
a companion along the other stayed
to watch the stairs

  in the face of desperate men that
descent of the basement stairway
would have been nothing short of sui-
cide and parks had every reason to
believe that he was in the den of clever
and unscrupulous criminals

  down they went carefully slowly
prepared for anything

  and all that took time - precious
minutes that were beyond price to the
man they were after

  in the pause that their absence
created while i listened for the sound
of strife i looked about me at the
seething crowd that was growing to
alarming dimensions at the grisly
thing upon the sidewalknow covered
with a white sheet at della placid
a thieves comedy



once more and her father mumbling
drunkenly to the policeman who held
him

  and near the old murderer almost
brushing arms with della was beans

  i drew a sharp breath and my good
eye opened wide

  how he had come there so swiftly
was a problem that staggered me and
at the same time led me to hope and
i almost laughed outright at the
thought of parks searching so care-
fully and cautiously an empty house

  all at once alice laid her fingers on
my arm

 you know who that is she
asked and shot a glance toward me
shroud beside the taxicab

  margaret jerked her head up and
catching the wonder in my face whis-
pered 

  who is it

  i gulped once looked toward alice
in some bewilderment and heard her
say very quietly

   your father dear when the de-
tectives come back let me explain and
dont say a word

  my-

  margaret drew away from me slow-
ly and stared at one glistening shoe-
buckle that protruded from beneath
the sheet she shuddered and i
thought she was going to fall but ere
my fingers had touched her arm she
steadied herself and trembling vio-
lently moved slowly down the steps
just as parks came pounding up the
basement stairs alone

   eighth avenue  i heard him
shout to the detective on watch in the
hall  theres an alleyway to them
flats next to schmidts saloon caff-
ney just grabbed one of the gang goin
over the back wall

  they came out and down the steps
like an avalanche and the crowd
cheered and broke before the rush
they made toward eighth avenue
and most of the people followed them
yelling all sorts of surmises with the
name  rob roy  sounding high
above the din

  margaret paused just long enough
to allow them to pass then without a
word went down to the sidewalk

  we followed instantly

  alices action brutal it seemed to
me was puzzling but the whole busi-
ness was so queer and tangled and the
excitement so intense that i could not
think out anything that was in the
least involved

  the doctor wtho had first examined
rollins leaned against the taxi wait-
ing i supposed for the arrival of the
ambulance a policeman using his
night-stick freely kept the space be-
fore the house cleared while his two
brothers in uniform waited with their
prisoners and helped him at the same
time

  the moment we reached the street
the policeman holding della barked

   where you goin  

  and another equally gruff voice
from behind ajid above us called
harshly

   hold them guess parks  want
to talk to the english guy

  proving that i had not gone unno-
ticed

  i turned my head and saw a detect-
ive whom i presumed was caffney
leading billy down the steps

  margaret glanced up into my face
and gripped my arm almost painfully
she was white to the lips and shaking
as with ague but she crossed the space
to her fathers side without a seconds
hesitation taking alice and me along

  in an instant there was a policeman
ready to push us back

   one moment officer i objected
as calmly as i could  this is his
daughter

   cut the con english  some one
said roughly behind me and i wheeled
instantly with the blood rushing to my
head

   you confounded-

   still as coarse as ever caffney
a smooth quiet voice upon margarets
other side broke in and the detectives
jaw dropped

  he almost released his hold upon


the all-story magazine

billy at the sight of alices set face
then free from its habitual hint of
humor

   you havent forgotten me have
you  

  evidently he hadnt

  margaret was gazing dully at what
lay at her feet and creeping closer to
me every second

   i cant look  she whispered  i
cant 

   i suppose there will be certain
formalities before we may take charge
of the body alice asked with a
calm that was chilly

   yes maam caffney answered

   thank you i suppose you are
under detective parkss orders

   yes maam

   very well well wait till the
ambulance comes tell detective
parks that please you know where
to find me at any time

  caffney drew away dragging billy
with him and leaving him in the care
of the policeman who held borrow-
man strode past us toward eighth
avenue

  pandemonium and chaos were min-
gled there and the swaying mass of
humans grew larger and larger every
moment every little while a shout
would go up and die away in a groan

  jeers and catcalls questions and
shouted answers the clanging of
tram gongs traffic disorganized more
and more policemen - all about the
capture of a single man whose name
floated hither and thither incessantly

  every few minutes i imagined it
was all over and when we went slow-
ly back to the steps to listen and watch
and wait my head was humming and
throbbing and though i tried to catch
alices eye and to understand her i
failed in both endeavors just as i
failed to guess at what the end would
be

  margaret huddled very near to me
shivering and looking everywhere but
toward the curb her eyes were tear-
less and she breathed as if her throat
were dry and hard

   above us rosie leaned against the
 baluster and seemed quite satisfied
 about the outcome della was alter-
 nately watching us and eighth ave-
 nue like a hawk and beans had shift-
 ed his position nearer to his father
 who avas mumbling to himself

   in the midst of the mob toward
 eighth avenue campbells escape
 would either lie screened or choked
 and once as a yell went up and the

 crowd surged into -th street i

 felt sure that the end had come

   but it was only the ambulance and
 the police-patrol making a path as they
 came clanging up the street

   parks followed by a policeman
 came heavily through the crowd el-
 bowing people right and left

   the detective was puffing and
 blowing as a result of his exertions
 he came directly toward us ignoring
 the proceeding of placing rollinss
 body in the ambulance

    alice spoke first

   you are detective parks she
 asked

    i am very gruffly  are you
 miss van huysen

    alices nod was barely perceptible

     caffney tell you  

     yes miss but i guess youve got
 yourself mixed up with a bad bunch
 this time this lady-miss rollins

    not now she has just been mar-
 ried to this gentleman who is her
 cousin the earl of didderington the
 ceremony was only completed a few
 moments before her father left he
 seemed to be afraid of something and
 insisted upon the marriage taking
 place down here because he was hi-
 ding from some one and wanted it to
 come off before he sailed for europe

    mr macgregor and he were
 great friends i believe and i think it
 was mr macgregor who suggested
 the highland costume as a disguise
 but i know very little about their inti-
  macy please try to make it as easy
 for us as you can you know where
 to find us at any time and if you wish
 me to i shall only be too glad to an-
a thieves comedy



 svver any questions and help you all i
 can in the terrible business

  she spoke so rapidly and so con-
vincingly that parks did not have
either a chance or apparently the in-
clination to interrupt and he was no
more surprised than margaret and p
there was a trace of campbell in
alices prevarications a twisting of
the truth which only one man could
have questioned and he was dead

  parks looked at me at margaret
then back to alice

   he is the earl of diddering-
thing 

   didderington alice corrected
 he has been using the name mason
to avoid publicity youve met him
before havent you

  the detectives face clouded for a
moment probably at a memory

   how did that varelli woman hap-
pen to seee you with macgregor last
saturday night he questioned me
sharply

   rollins was to have met me down
there but he didnt turn up i an-
swered taking a leaf from alices
book  i told you i hadnt the faint-
est idea-

   all right came the interruption
heavily and there were a few mo-
ments of agonizing hesitation that
seemed to concern me principally
well i guess i cant hold you get-
ting married aint a crime

  then he touched my arm nodded
toward margaret and his voice
dropped suddenly

   get her out of this shes goin
to faint in a minute i guess i can
find you if i want you good night
and he turned sharply upon his
heel to issue orders as rapidly as his
tongue could move while i blessed the
condition that gained privileges for
fifth avenue and berkley square
whether they told the truth or not

  alice did not hesitate a moment
but hurried us unchallenged and un-
checked to the taxi which had waited
for rollins a policeman clearing a
path for us opened the door

  a buzz of comment went up as i
gave the chap the direction to my ho-
tel intending to get some of my bag-
gage there and move on elsewhere i
had a glimpse of della and beans
watching us across the great gorge of
class distinction the former sneering
the latter sullen

  the ambulance drew out with its
ghastly burden as we crowded into
the cab and our chauffeur took advan-
tage of the lane it made to follow it
quickly out

  he drove toward eighth avenue
and through the window i saw a small
army of detectives and policemen dis-
persing the crowd and keeping watch-
ful eyes upon the entrances to a num-
ber of flats in which campbell was be-
lieved to be secreted

  i hoped he had got out-hoped it
fervently-and that he was putting as
many miles between himself and parks
as possible his days as rob roy
were over of that much i was sure
as we trundled away from that scene
of turmoil and disaster none of us
seemingly very anxious to speak

  alice though white and tight of
lip had given no sign that she was in
the least disturbed about campbells
safety at least not after parks had
failed to find him in the house

  margaret clung to me there was
no sign of a tear nothing save an
agonizing question in her eyes

  her lips moved silently as if she
were saying the question over to her-
self before letting us hear

   why-were they chasing-

   dont dear not to-night please
its all right everything

  her breath caught sharply and i
thought she smothered a sob as she
looked abruptly out of the window

  finally the cab stopped

  just a few minutes i whispered
and before i could open the door a
gold-laced starter had performed the
service for me

  the second i reached the sidewalk
i knew there was some mistake

  it wasnt my hotel at all

   what the dickens  i began ap-
proaching the chauffeur  didnt i

riding into danger

  before i had time to take stock of
anything more than the miserable
black mustache that covered his upper
lip the cab was moving away

  for one gasping second i thought
he was carrying my bride away and
the next found her at my elbow trying
to smile as i stood blinking down at
her and after the podgy vehicle rat-
tling off toward fifth avenue

  how campbell had managed it i
could not imagine but i quickly ap-
preciated that nerve was the principal
ingredient toward his success and re-
membering the horde of policemen
and detectives that had been all about
the cab the thing became funny or
ludicrous if you will and serious as
everything was i could barely restrain
my enjoyment of the  joke

   lets go somewhere and have
your eye fixed i heard margaret
whisper

   you cant go into the hotel like
that

   no i agreed  cant go in at
all without baggage what the deuce
did he drop us here for 

   everythings here she mur-
mured moving away from the ques-
tioning scrutiny of the starter and a
passer-by  mr campbell had it
moved from your old place to-day-
mine too there is a drug-store across
the street

  we went across to the chemists
and one of the chaps there doctored
my eye and sold me a patch to cover
its unsightliness after which with my

head hardly less painful than it had
been thought i stoically kept my hat at
a respectable angle we repaired to the
hotel where we found that campbell
in his arrangements to defeat all of
rollinss schemes had left nothing
undone even to the last detail of en-
gaging a suite for us

  as we ascended in one of the eleva-
tors i came to the unhappy conclusion
that margaret and i had been but
pawns in a game that had necessarily
to end with the social or physical anni-
hilation of one of the players

  the ending was written in marga-
rets face and the moment we were
alone she lurched rather than walked
to a chair and cowering into its
friendly depths shook from head to
foot in a paroxysm of fear and horror
-with her fingers in her ears

  i went to her at once and putting
my arms about her tried to comfort
her and lead her mind away from the
ghastly memory upon it

  but still she shivered tearless and
white-with her fingers in her ears

   i can-hear him-scream   she
whispered

  the morning papers were full of it
-of the murder the mob the melo-
dramatic escape of the leader of the
notorious rob roy gang the  ineffi-
ciency of the police the histories of
della her father and his victim and
of our marriage and alices explana-
tion of it

  the accounts were hopelessly jum-
bled so that the  man in the street 
had about a dozen stories from which
to pick and choose and draw his own
conclusions of a very tangled affair

  but old man borrowmans reason
for the shooting was always the same

  it told plainly with the addition of
several reportorial frills of what rol-
lins had been guilty and every news-
paper without a single exception
made the circumstance agree with the
 something  of which alice had said
her uncle was afraid

  my morning was rather restless
a thieves comedy



and i spent most of it keeping away
the reporters and explaining to mar-
garet several matters by no means
pleasant but which necessarily had to
be made clear to her

  i told her of the gobbler of the
marriage campbell had contemplated
of the fate of her jewelry and the ori-
gin of my bad eye-everything but the
fact that her father had plotted for my
life

  when i had completed the lines of
her mouth were a little hard her
fingers gripped mine listlessly and
even the ringing of a telephone - bell
did not send the dull pained look out
of her eyes

  i rose and going to the instrument
called quietly

   hello 

   hello- didderington 

   yes i did not have to ask to
whom the deep bass voice at the other
end of the wire belonged

   mrs van huysen would like to
have your apologies and those of the
countess come right over will you 
 just a minute

  i turned toward margaret

   your aunt wants us to go over
and apologize shall we 

   not to apologize she answered
and her lips closed firmly upon it

   the countess says she wont apolo-
gize i told campbell  upon that
understanding we shall be over imme-
diately

  a soft laugh came along the wire

   good make it in ten minutes
we ran the gantlet of inquisitive
eyes going out of the hotel and into
the van huysenss

  there were reporters lying in wait
and a more than usual crowd of the
sort of people who seem to have noth-
ing else to do except to take a violent
interest in other peoples affairs

  randor imperturbable as usual let
us in and showed us into the morning-
room where we found alice alone
and as she rose to smile us welcome i
saw that there was a doubt upon her
mind about something or other

  she avoided all reference to the pre-
vious evenings happenings said her
mother would be down in a few
moments and for those few moments
i felt peculiarly ill at ease as if some-
thing should happen but didnt

  just as i was on the point of asking
her about the nurse and maid the door
opened and my single eye hurriedly
avoided meeting the entrance of mrs
van huysen whose pallor was ac-
centuated by the black of the gown she
wore but whose eyes and voice tried
to make light of her ordeal

  behind her came - the nurse with
the gobbler

  and then campbell

  margaret ran forward to be swept
into a motherly embrace and while i
stood aside feeling uncommonly un-
comfortable my wife was introduced
to her half brother who did not seem
to care a rap about it

  alice and her mother circled about
the  ceremony seemingly surprised
that margaret asked no questions
about the boy and i found campbell
suddenly very near to me

  he nodded toward the door and i
followed him out of the room into an-
other - the library - which was far
enough away to give us the strictest
privacy and judging by the careful
way in which my companion closed the
door he evidently had something very
important to say

  there was no sign of ralph

   how did you manage that last
night i demanded at once

  he grunted derisively and in spite
of the suggestion in his manner that
the explanation was an awful fag he
told me that his chauffeuring rig-out
had been in the kitchen where he had
shed it when he got into the house
and he entered the same way as he
went out-by way of schmidts saloon
on eighth avenue

  a ladder over the back wall and an
alleyway to schmidts back door
formed the principal means of exit
and he had to get into his leathern
coat leggings and wigs on the way


the all-story magazine

   schmidt hasnt had the saloon
long he added dryly  about two
years pie got it when i took the
house or i took the house when he got
the saloon whichever you prefer

   you mean the place is yours 

   no but i found it convenient to
help put schmidt into it and his grati-
tude allows us to use his back door

   by the way im afraid parks is
going to bother you he is coming to
interview alice in a few minutes -
telephoned quite nicely less than half
an hour ago and im sure he would
not trouble her this early if he had not
learned something worth while there
is only one link missing in his chain
and i think he is coming here to
frighten alice into forging it

   if she wont hell try to use mar-
garet and you you see im afraid
he has learned or will learn very soon
that miss macgregor and miss van
huysen are the same person the cul-
prit is our friend beans

   what 

  campbell nodded his head slowly
and his mouth tightened

   yes remarkable isnt it he is
as blind as a bat to his own interests
his type usually are when they imag-
ine they are being ill - treated and
where he leads there -are fifty of the
smaller fry who will follow believing
their necks are in danger

   crabbe and paler and most of their
crews have already left the city the
clachan was closed by the police this
morning andy the bartender is be-
ing held on suspicion the rest like
rats are leaving the sinking ship for
which i dont blame them in the least
in a case of this sort it is every man
for himself  an the deil tak the hin-
most but to get back to lieutenant
beans

   unfortunately he met alice the
nurse and the baby and i as we were
leaving the cathedral parkway apart-
ment last night that was after we
left you he was clever enough to
suspect that i might be likely to do
something of the sort or perhaps

della whispered the suspicion to him
in any case he raised a deuce of a
row because i insisted that the gob-
bler would be cared for by rollinss
people

   that shooting didderington can-
celed everything-everything 

  he rose impatiently his face cloud-
ing with a shadow of the anger he had
felt when his plan for rollinss safety
had miscarried

   i wont raise a finger or a dollar
to save borrowman and i wont be
threatened into doing so no man can
kill on my door-step and get me to
help him escape the penalty beans
knows that i told him so last night
and had to knock him down to pre-
vent that revolver of his from doing
any harm

   there is only one way out of this
you must forge parkss last link you
will avoid all sorts of trouble if you
tell parks what he wants to know not
only trouble for yourself but every
one else - the girls particularly of
course you could perjure yourself and
lie a blue streak but avith your respon-
sibilities you cant afford to take a
chance of being caught at that

  alice can take care of herself
seton tait will look after della be-
cause her life is only beginning and
i think apart from what she did for
me last night she ought to have a
chance the others-well ishall at-
tend to them

   but i cant do a thing for you to
get you and margaret cleanly out of
this mess i dragged you into it but
you must get yourself out-and take
the gobbler with you

  he looked sharply at me from under
lowering eyebrows while i sat aghast
incapable of solving either his argu-
ment or his indifference to the coming
of parks

   you will sail next wednesday-
after the funeral - and the gobbler
and his nurse shall sail with you the
nurse is an old member of the family
-took care of margaret when she was
a kiddie so shes harmless but to be
a thieves comedy



allowed to get out of this country with-
out having the police at your heels
you must tell parks the whole story
or enough of it to convince him that
you are telling the truth

   otherwise you are likely to be held
here indefinitely with beans going
about with blood in his eye you un-
derstand  

   you dont think i would be such
a cad as to-

  rubbish youve got your wife
and the gobbler to think about i said
-the gobbler

  again he looked questioningly at
me evidently expecting me to make
some objection to that

   thats all right margaret and i
will look after him but that other
business hang it all i-

  he laughed in the depths of him
and came round the table holding out
his hand as his giant fingers closed
about mine he said quietly

   thank you i knew you would
help me when the time came but i
see i must force you into that other
thing unless you want to spend your
honeymoon in jail you need not be
in the least anxious about me i am
quite capable of-

  a little tap upon the door interrupt-
ed him

  come he called in a low tone
and randor appeared

   mr parks to see miss van huy-
sen be announced in a low monotone
as if he had been advised to do so

  i glanced quickly up into campbells
face and saw him nod understand-
ing

   any one with him 

   no sir

   all right show him in here

chapter xxxvi

riding out

  with a sensation that the floor was
sliding from under me i listened to the
heavy footsteps in the hall coming
nearer and nearer

  campbell dug his hands into his
jacket-pockets

   most peculiar thing i ever heard
of he said loudly  miss van huy-
sen tells me he is extraordinarily like
me and now you say youd swear in a
court of justice that we were the same
man i met the fellow once i think
but i didnt seem to see the startling-
 detective parks

  randors inflectionless voice ushered
the detective across the threshold and
a foot within the room parks halted
looking as if he had come into the
wrong place and was on the verge of
apologizing and when the valet avent
out closing the door the detective
started slightly glanced quickly behind
him then back at campbell

  parkss expression suggested that he
did not believe it all the odds in the
mental conflict of those first few mo-
ments avere against him campbell
had planned the business parks avas
groping in an even greater darkness
than i

   good morning mr parks miss
van huysen will be in presently she
has been telling me about last evening
and both she and the earl - mason
you know-have been remarking how
terribly like this rob roy chap i am
the earl says hed savear to it in court
though the first time he saav mac-
gregor he did not see the resemblance
so closely

   it avas rather dark you know and
last night apparently macgregor avasnt
wearing such hideous clothes - and
that seemed to make all the difference
i avish youd catch this double of mine
and let me haae a good look at him
how did you ever manage to let him
get aaa-ay like that 

  parks smiled and there avas a hint
of admiration in it but the cold light
in his eyes told that the time for fen-
cing with avords had passed

   i guess hes pretty much like you
mr campbell slick you knoav--and
reckless it dont always pay to be too
reckless though because-

  i saav his right hand move


the all-story magazine

   that will do up with your hands
-both of you-quick  

  there was a glint of metal in camp-
bells hand an oath from parks and a
sudden stop to the movement of his
right arm

   get them up 

  mine rose at once parks blazing-
eyed and frothy was a little slower
and in thirty seconds campbell- had
reached his side slapped his pockets
extracted a weapon and a pair of
handcuffs and had backed away say-
ing pleasantly

   i can use these now please get
over beside the gentleman who claims
i am macgregor weve had quite an
argument about it and he thinks i
ought to be in jail so i thought id
wait to see what you thought about it
thanks- as parks moved obedient-
ly to my side because he could not help
himself  stick out your right hand
-and you didderington your left

   wh-what the deuce-

   that will do i am going to give
you a chance to tell this gentleman
how much like macgregor i am and
so that he wont get away from you
while youre boring him to death with
the story these handcuffs-how the
deuce do you open them parks i
youd better do it

  and he handed the things to the de-
tective in the most matter-of-fact way
but with a look in his eye and a manner
of handling himself and the weapon
he held that made resistance resemble
suicide

  parkss lips were tightly compressed
his eyes were like living coals and his
hands trembled perceptibly as he hand-
cuffed himself to me i was beginning
to lose sight of the joke

  ft confound you  i began a little
warmly  what-

   as you please campbell agreed
 but i should advise you to tell mr
parks what you think of me he will
appreciate it so much more lets see
that telephone-cord should do very
well and please remember i have
two hands and two revolvers very

handy so i think youd better not be
foolish

  he laid the weapon down upon the
table too far away for either of us to
reach and within an inch or two of his
hand all the while he acquired enough
telephone-cord to rope a horse

   you may sit down and mr parks
may kneel and listen to the story at
your knee quite a happy idea quick
i havent much time

   sat down utterly dumfounded
and parks because he had to game
down with me to his knees i never
took part in anything more systematic
or idiotic and ill wager the detective
who went red and white in turns didnt
either

  there wasnt a sound in the hall and
though there was plenty of life passing
to and fro in the street we might have
had the house to ourselves

  in an instant campbell had wound
the telephone-cord about us under our
armpits then twisting it in about our
arms so that we could barely move
them above the wrists he finally made
us both fast to the chair

  working like a streak and breathing
a little more heavily he said when he
was almost finished

   i hope mr parks wont be so
ridiculous as to hold the lady of the
house responsible for this little enter-
tainment at present she is in a room
not far from here with the counters of
didderington and the baby that caused
all the trouble and they havent the
faintest idea of what is going on

   didderington brought me in here
to tell me how much like macgregor
i was and i told the butler to show
you in so that the earl might have you
all to himself to tell you about it
thats the whole plot

  he stepped back a few paces to re-
view his handiwork

   perhaps id better gag you-
what  

  parks sputtered like a bad squib
and if the telephone-cord hurt him as
much as it did me i could not blame
him i was becoming irritable enough
a thieves comedy



to want to tell the story and felt that
a gag would be the last straw

   no i wont gag you diddering-
ton could not tell you what he thinks
about me if i did and a few minutes-
is all i need there is your revolver
mr parks

  there came three distinct but very
light knocks upon tliq door

  campbell smiled and moved toward
it noiselessly with a tread so light one
wondered how he did it

   thank you gentlemen you have
been very kind remember me to the
countess didderington

  his hand went out to the knob care-
lessly

   and the gobbler

  he pulled the door open just a little
and wedged himself into the space

   good-by mr parks

  i can hear the deep bass of that adieu
now-can see the laughter in his eyes
and behind that a touch of sadness

  the height and breadth of him the
red of his hair and the tightening lines
of his mouth come back to me-also
the tip of a hat-plume behind him

  that was all i saw of alice van
huy sen

  then in a moment he had slipped
from sight and the door closing silent-
ly shut them out

  parks did not move

  i looked down at him and found
him staring at the door as if it fasci-
nated him

  then as i wondered why he did not
shout or struggle his head came round
slowly and our eyes met

  there was an awkward pause

  if you holler ill knock your block
oft  i heard him say and thought i
dreamed it

  yet i struggled for my own safety
to play my part

   piell get away if some one doesnt
come and-

  the look that came into parkss eyes
halted me it was a mixture of con-
tempt and pity

   get away why you-you-oh

well - whats the use you dont
know any better as he strove to
reach his vest-pocket he continued to
growl he fooled you every way
from the ace and the minute you
thought you were wise to him you
took him into a quiet corner of a house
this size and told him about it huh
and when hes made monkeys of us
inside of four walls you think weve
got a chance to catch up with him
when lies got the whole world to run
about in you oughta be pulled

   im sorry i murmured penitently

   all right ill take your word for
it he mumbled then objected sharp-
ly  dont move away you dope
lean to me thats better a little
more striving to get at his waistcoat-
pocket  now we got it 

  his knife was what he was after
and he fumbled with it till he got it
open while i leaned toward him as
much as the cord would allow in an
effort to slacken it a little

  as he sawed industriously at our
bonds his glance went frequently to-
avard the door as though he were in
dread that some one might come in
and when he finally succeeded in cut-
ting us loose my sigh of relief was
 more fervent than his

  the handcuffs were a matter of a
moment and as we both stood up with
the pieces of telephone - cord at our
feet parks looked straight at me-so
straight that i felt uncomfortable

   going back to england soon   he
asked gruffly

  next wednesday after the
funeral

  he looked relieved but as he turned
to pick up his revolver he stopped
scrutinized me again and made his
point more clear

   if you open your face about this
to a livin soul youll never go back
understand  

   i wont say a word i assured him
with more fervor than he dreamed of

   all right wheres the way out 

 he snatched up his revolver then
stepped back with a gasp as if the thing


the aee-story magazine

that was under it might strike cra-
ning my neck a little i saw a card-a
card with a border of red and black
squares in the center of which was
neatly printed-

for charity

  parks stared at it a moment or two
while i turned my face away then
shaking his head as if the matter were
beyond him he picked the card up very
carefully pocketed it and strode
toward the door without a word

  randor expressionless as a brick
wall met us in the hall the sound of
womens voices came from the morn-
ing-room

  parks did not even hesitate

  with a  good morning  that was
peculiarly subdued he went out and
down the steps his shoulders drooping
a little and his head forward as if in
thought reporters swarmed round
him but he brushed them aside and
marched steadily on-still thinking

  randor quietly closed the door

  with something akin to pity i turned
toward the morning-room then halt-
ing asked the butler in as easy a tone
as i could muster 

 miss van iiuysen has gone

  randors face twitched

   yes sir air campbell and she
went together

  peering into the library he gasped
in outraged servitude at the disorder
parks and i had left- he limped by
me to gather lip the telephone-rope and
set things to eights

  i stood momentarily in the hallway
straightening my ruffled clothing and
trying to do the same with my disor-
dered thoughts the womens voices
-almost gay in spite of the tragedy
about us-were raised in discussion in
the morning-room

  they were talking about the gob-
bler margaret i was sure would wor-
ship the little waif

  what about those other waifs-the
gregarach and alice  think of alice
-dignified smart unemotional alice
aran huysen-slipping away with the
thief  the world would raise its hands
in grinning horror it was laughable
-it was tragic

  and now the two principal charac-
ters of this tragic farce had left the
stage-perhaps never to be seen again
the curtain was about to be rung down
so i went back to the bosom of my
 family -to margaret and the crow-
ing gobbler-sure that whatever some
of the other players might have before
them my part was ended in this com-
edy of thieves

                 the end

his kisses burned her lips and
left her breathless palpita-
ting

  by what little light there was in the
shadow of the hedge he could see that
she kept her eyes tight closed and
could not restrain the convulsive wri-
thing of her mouth

  her left cheek was splotched with
vivid crimson where his unshaven
chin had chafed its unnatural pallor
her fingers remained clenched tensely
in his waistcoat and he was forced to
shake her roughly before she roused
and relaxed her grip

 yera-shy child he murmured

  that he spoke did not at first pene-
trate her quivering consciousness she
was too agitated for that vaguely
she was aware of a vast change in her
inner being-a renascence of self so
to speak

  involuntarily her thoughts slipped
back to tomasz her betrothed the
memory of him smote her soul with
what amounted to a physical shock

   why or why is it that the faculty
of-wooing thus is reserved for the no-
ble born   she thought

  then she turned her eyes back upon
the man whose arms still enwrapped

    	s

her and he was glad to observe that
reason had once more replaced the
vacuous ecstasy which his passion had
roused

 vera he said again this time
more loudly  are you calm again  
the girl fought down the tremu-
lous listeria that rose within her and
pressed his hot cheek with hers

   calm   she sighed breathing
rapidly no not that i think that
i shall never be calm again

  the reassurance the man threw into
his laugh sounded hollow out there in
the lone stillness of the night

   but you do love me vera you
are not afraid any more 

  she shivered and again closed her
eyes her words came thick inartic-
ulate

   yes i am stilll afraid  but who am
i to deny the devotion you offer me
i am only old yakofs brat-doomed
to poverty since the beginning and
you are a boyar-a great nobleman

   yes said he proudly  i am ni-
kolai iaroslaf yet  feel that it is no
condescension to love you

  the girl went on as if she had not
heard him you have asked me to
go away with you-to leave my father
and brothers the hut which has been
my home to see other horizons than


the all-story magazine

this-to flee from tomasz my be-
trothed

   and do you regret that  queried
milord wonderingly  am i weighed
in the balance with a yokel 

   no said she  no sir only
to-morrow was to have been my wed-
ding day and to-night-to-night you
have said much of what we shall be
to each other but nothing of what we
shall be to the world

  nikolai iaroslaf laughed as he took
her closer in his arms

 an honest girl quoth he  as
well as a pretty one my dear do you
doubt but that i mean fairly by you 
 how can i judge when you have
blinded me with love cried she

 there was poor yekaterina the
millers daughter who fled with the
count vladimir who knows what
has become of her my brother sine-
ous says-

  pish yekaterina was yekate-
rina and you are you is this count-
vladimir become a standard on the
countryside by which to estimate all
other gentlemen

   you are angry whimpered the
girl hiding her face against his chest
 ah do not look at me so i will go
away with you

  far off across the vapor-shrouded
tilled lands a dog howled mournfully
the girl shivered and struggled out of
the mans embrace

   to-morrow night - here  she
whispered as if afraid some one might
overhear her  good-by

  wait said he

  once more her senses swum drunk-
enly as the breath was crushed from
her body by the impact of his embrace
she walked unsteadily back toward
the hollow where her fathers house
stood the mans lips were acrid with
the tears that had welled out from be-
neath her eyelids where he kissed her

    ii

  all of the next day relatives kept
arriving

  some came riding bareback on
shaggy ponies some bumping over the
rutted roads in springless droshkies
some afoot from the distance of a
league or more everybody was good-
humored and keen for what fun might
be got out of the wedding

  old yakof veras father and her
brother sineous waved their hands to
each newcomer as they bent to chesty
work in the fields

  the men guests as they arrived
stabled their horses and went out
among the furrows to help their
hosts the womenfolk bustled indoors
chattering to poke sly fun at the
bride-to-be and to do their part in the
kitchen where great preparations for
the prenuptial feast were under way

  vera her drab mother and three
buxom sisters were there elbow-deep
in the mysteries of flour and pastry
their faces were flushed from long
standing over the ovens there were
kisses and hugging on all sides and
an unceasing babel of conversation

  oh the eager trembling maiden
laughed black-eyed olga a cousin
from a near - by village  see how
demure she is 

  vera gave the bantering company
a troubled smile which conveyed the
impression that her mind was astray
on other things

   do not tease me please she
said

  no dont do that let her think
of her absent lover cried olga
shrill- whereat there was more rail-
lery in the midst of which veras
guilty confusion was attributed to the
memory of her betrothed it took
the girl some time to chicle herself
into tranquillity again

   i am unstrung - i am silly she
kept telling herself  but i thought
for a moment that the knew of ni-
kolai iaroslaf the boyar i must be
calm-calm i must not let them sus-
pect anything oh if this long day
would only come to an end 

  the girls heart was not in her
work her mind was twelve hours
love goes blindly



forward at the place where her noble
lover was to meet her-where she
would bid a last fareweh to these
scenes of her childhood

  of what the future might hold for
her vera did not permit herself to
think she would not trust herself to
do more than recall the breathless rap-
ture of his embrace of the hot words
that made her palpitant even now in
reminiscence he had said that she
was to leave drudgery and homespun
behind her as things incompatible
with his love for her he had said

   those little hands were made to
be kissed not for milking

  all that tomasz had said of them
was your hands are white and
strong vera would you not like to
keep the household for me  

  she had answered yes with the
family approval and all of the coun-
tryside had congratulated her to-
masz was a hard worker sober enough
as men went and thrifty in his ways

   he will make a good father for
your children the old folks had told
the girl and she assented passively
enough

  she was willing then that it should
be so she knew that many a maiden
envied her the privilege and she
planned things in a humble way-
until nikolai laroslaf came

  vera met him for the first time at
the county fair he had singled her
out from a group of black-eyed maid-
ens doing country dances on the
green he had induced her to step off
to one side with him and he had said
 of all the girls here to-day you
are prettiest child i like you

  veras eyes had answered his it
tickled her vanity that so fine a gentle-
man should have noticed her so she
humored what she mistook for a pass-
ing whim saying to herself

   i shall never see him again any-
way wherein is the harm of a little
coquetry  

  to a maiden the harm is never self-
evident when nikolai laroslaf the
boyar and she kissed down by the

brookside that day their sensations
were the same yet far differently in-
terpreted to the man they implied a
specific thing-to the girl they were
only vague stirrings of the emotions
-a hunger for she knew not what and
which if she had located it would
have frightened and repelled rather
than have allured her

  even in subsequent meetings when
the man had roused passion in her the
girl remained neuter in so far as she
attached any significance to her feel-
ings it was not until that last night
when his vehemence had torn the veil
away from fundamentals that she was
made shamefacedly conscious - ac-
knowledged that love implied subju-
gation

  and now she had promised to go
away with him-to see life as a wom-
an sees it from the masculated view-
point she dreaded she was fright-
ened she avas ashamed of the mater-
nal instinct thus awakened yet she
would go the love of nikolai iaros-
laf and the splendid future he offered
her made life in a hovel now intolera-
ble

  at sundown all of the men came
tramping in from their grimy work in
the fields they were sweaty and
smelled-they were uproarious in
their greetings

  ten fifteen twenty hairy lips
smacked hearty kisses upon the girls
cheek and found her unresponsive
she met each of them dumbly the
time was drawing short now

  by and by tomasz her betrothed
arrived his hair was sleeked down
with lambs grease until it glistened
and he wore his worsted holiday
clothes he was a far bigger man
though younger than nikolai iaros-
laf the tremendous muscles of his
chest arms and legs showed even
through his garments when he
laughed the whole room reverberated
fromit and the guests smiled saying

   young tomasz feels jolly to-
night he is thinking of ripe lips and
a priest on the morrow


the all-story magazine

  vera hung back when everybody
else rushed to bid the bridegroom wel-
come she was observing him through
the eyes of nikolai iaroslaf and
shivered

  the young man shook hands all
around answering jest with jest he
was in high good humor and kept
craning his neck for sight of his
sweetheart

  vera where is little vera he
cried

  old yakof her father pushed the
white-faced girl toward him through
the jostling press of relatives

   here she is son said he  here
is the bashful bride

  tomasz hugged her unaffectedly
before them all and was surprised
when she finally broke away from
him he bent awkwardly and whis-
pered in her ear

   we have not long now little one
 no answered she  not long
now

  she was thinking of nikolai iaros-
laf and the trysting hour

  the prenuptial feast was served
upon a long oaken trestle with the
guests seated on each side of it
there were not enough chairs to go
round so some of the people sat on
boxes and some on logs of firewood
dragged in from the yard vera was
pulled down upon her betrotheds lap

   sit here and i will feed you rosy
one he told her

  she struggled futilely for a moment
under the restraint of his iron arms
and then submitted passively to her
position everybody made merry
with them and indulged in the clumsy
innuendos common to middle - class
gatherings at such a time

   do not mind them dear whis-
pered tomasz  they mean their
jests in good part

   i did not even hear what they
said replied vera  i was thinking
of something else

  the food was served in huge wood-
en platters from which each diner
help himself generously the loaves

of rye bread were torn apart with the
fingers and the great smoking
haunches of meat were apportioned
by the knives that each man carried at
his belt

  there was home-brewed beer for
the drinking and each tankard held
nearly a quart it was but natural
that the crowd should get more or less
drunk

  tomasz holding vera astride of
one mighty knee fed her the choicest
morsels from the platters he would
dip his hand into the ragout and pick
out pieces of meat which he would
force between her lips and kiss her
afterward

  no more-i cannot eat any more
tomasz-i am not hungry to-night
she would expostulate from time to
time

  then he would hug her roughly
and say

   you are thinking little bride-is
it not so  and she would answer

  yes i am thinking tomasz

  when even that great quantity of
food was all consumed they still drank
on the dinner rapidly assumed the
semblance of an orgy the hour grew
late and tomasz with the heat of
much malt in his veins grew more
ardent vera repulsed him as well as
she could

   let me go-i am tired she in-
sisted  it is time that i was in bed
tomasz

   daughter is right cried old
yakof pounding upon the table for
silence  the wedding is to be at
nine in the morning and it will take
us a good two hours to get from here
to the village where father ivan is to
await us so let the bride have her
rest and well see bright eyes and rosy
cheeks on her in the morning

  tomasz assented reluctantly amid a
general clapping of hands he
strained vera to him in a good-night
embrace and gloomed after her figure
as it disappeared behind the door of
her room olga seated beside him
pulled the swains ears laughing
love goes blindly



   cheer up doleful one  ex-
claimed she  after to-morrow you
will have her always with you

  but tomasz remained gloomy and
silent almost it seemed as if he were
in the grip of a premonition lie tried
to console himself with his already
oft-emptied tankard

  meanwhile vera was alone at last
in her room she leaned breathing
hard against the rough pine wall try-
ing to compose her mind the strain
of that long days pretense had un-
nerved her

  her faculties were benumbed her
head was heavy-her eyes seemed
leaden without undressing she threw
herself upon the bed and with a sigh
closed her eyes

  she would rest thus-just for a
little while

  it yet lacked three hours of cock-
crow-the time she had set for her
flight nikolai laroslaf was to tap
thrice very softly at her window
his droshky with two of the fleetest
horses on the steppes were to be
awaiting them hidden in the hollow
where he had met her the night before

  all the wedding guests would be
sunk deep in slumbar in the outhouses
-some maybe lying out on the grass
but they would not hear the clatter of
hoofs as the bride fled away they
would be too beer-fuddled for that

  nikolai laroslaf would drive fast
with his one skilled hand on the reins
and his other clasped round the waist
of her whom he was bearing away to
better things he would show her the
wonders of moscow of st peters-
burg of foreign lands perhaps

  he would give her shoes and stock-
ings to wear-hang a rope of pearls
around her neck how nice it would
seem to feel soft warm furs nestling
close round ones throat-to do noth-
ing but lie soft in the arms of a great
nobleman and hear him say

   your little hands were made for
kisses not milking dear heart 

  to rise late in the morning and-
and-and-

  the girls breathing was soft and
regular

  she lay there with her red lips
parted in a vague smile with the flush
of dreams on her cheeks

  she slept and time slipped away

iii

  vera did not hear the cocks crow
-did not anticipate the first pallid
streaks of dawn along the horizon
line it was rather a subtle prescience
that the trysting hour was come that
startled her suddenly from the depths
of troubled slumber

  a nameless dread-a formless pre-
monition weighted her sensibilities

  the house was wrapped in an audi-
ble silence it seemed to the girl as
if she were left all alone on earth

  she was conscious that she had
overslept the hour she knew there
was need for hurry yet she could not
shake off the inexplicable torpor

  the sky glowed pink through a rent
in the old skirt she had hung before
her window it warned her to make
speed the chill of early morning bit
through her dress and raised goose-
flesh on her bare arms

  she experienced a sinking sensation
at the pit of her stomach and shivered
closing her eyes tight and biting her
lips until the blood left them and they
remained white as chalk was it the
frost in the air that made her feel so
or was it the thought of all that then
hung in the balance vera could not
tell

  rat tat tat-a sudden guarded
tattoo upon her window

  the girl stilled the hysterical
scream that rose to her lips and caught
her breath-waiting

  rat tat tat rat tat tat

  there it avas again more insistent
less guarded imperious this time it
avas he - nikolai laroslaf vera
caught a dark shawl from a peg on
the avail cast it round her shoulders
and slipped to her door avith a flutter-
ing heart


the all-story magazine

  she opened the door cautiously
inch by inch and peered into the outer
room

  stertorous breathing met her ears
on every side the first ghastly rays
of morning struggling through the
single window lent the scene an added
grimness

  the long trestle yet stood with the
remains of last nights food and un-
washed dishes upon it

  the wedding guests-here a gigan-
tic bearded man there a disheveled
woman-lay sprawled about on the
floor snoring their mouths open their
clothes still on the reek of stale
beer was nauseating on the air all
were fast asleep

  cat-footed the girl stole out among
them lifting her skirts high and step-
ping over those of the sleepers whom
she could not go around

  once one shaggy peasant almost un-
der her very feet thrashed about with
his arms grumbling in a guttural tone

  vera stood rigid sweaty with fear
in the belief that he might awaken
he did not and with a gasp she got
safely by him and out through the
house door into the yard where the
air was cool and clean

  it had already begun to grow light
the eastern sky was flooded with
crimson and the rim of the sun was
rising like a fiery ball out across the
flat expanse of the steppes a bird
twittered tentatively on the limb of an
adjacent tree and cocked its head at
the huddled figure by the door

  hugging the wall close the girl
turned the corner of the house and
scurried across the intervening space
between it and the stables she could
hear the ponies champing and stomp-
ing in their stalls the smell of the
hay was sweet in her nostrils she
paused there for a momentary glance
back at the home she was leaving

  as she turned to go a great shaggy
shape stalked out of the black yawn-
ing barn door and blocked her path
with bared fangs and hair bristling all
along its spine a menacing growl

rooted her to the spot as she recog-
nized janos the boarhound of tomasz
her betrothed

  it was a frightful moment the
beasts eyes gleamed redly wicked at
her a wrong move and he would be
at her throat a single bark and he
would awaken those whom she was de-
serting

   janos-down boy  the girl whis-
pered casting back the shawl so that
the dog might see her face plainly
 dont you know me janos it is i
vera who has fed you so often

  slowly the pricked ears relaxed and
the beasts tail began to wag in friend-
ly fashion he stalked forward and
thrust his cold moist nose into the
girls trembling palm

  he looked up into her face under-
standingly as if to say   ah yes  i
recognize you now mistress you are
pretty little vera whom tomasz my
master loves so do not be afraid i
will not hurt you i will keep you safe
for him

  the girl stroked the dogs head with
quick persuasive fingers she urged
him back to the barn door and tried to
make him go inside

  lie down janos - be quiet she
whispered

  then she tried to slip away but in
a trice he was up and at ber heels
again several times she tried to
make him leave her but always with-
out success in despair she at last set
off at a run the hound followed
close at her heels

  the ground dipped low into a kind
of valley in which the wind - blasted
grass was dry and ankle-deep less
than a quarter of a mile away a clump
of ancient trees stretched gaunt
gnarled limbs heavenward as if in
protest against their desolate environ-
ment

  the fleeing girl kept her eyes fixed
fast on them they were her destina-
tion hidden in their shelter nikolai
iaroslaf was waiting with his droshky
and fleet horses - waiting impatiently
to bear her away to splendid things
love goes blindly



  as she neared her goal a horse
neighed and a cloaked figure stepped
forth to meet her it was he

  the boyar was booted and wore a
little round astrakhan cap that fitted
close to his hesd and became him well
his clothes were of bright blue broad-
cloth and the fine linen frill of his
shirt-bosom fluttered in the morning
breeze

  the girl noticed that he carried a
little riding-crop in his hand but failed
to see the angry scowl that vanished as
she put out her hands to him

   you are foolishly late said he
abruptly making an effort to soften
the harshness that crept into his voice
 come we must hurry they may
awaken and miss you at any moment
now

  vera leaned panting against his
shoulder she was palpitant from the
strain of her long run

   wait  she gasped  i-i am so
tired 

  nikolai iaroslaf grasped her arm
and urged her lagging feet toward
where his equipage was to be seen
through the trees

   i cannot afford to wait he insist-
ed  do you-want them to come out
and catch us we must hurry i tell
you 

   one minute-im afraid pleaded
the girl trying to twist loose from the
hard pressure of his fingers  you-
you frighten me when you say things
to me in that tone nikolai

  the nobleman gritted his teeth to
withhold the oath that sprang to his
lips he glanced back over his shoul-
der in the direction of the house

   dont be foolish he snarled
 this is no time for silliness of that
kind you have gone too far to re-
treat now my girl

  not the words but their intonation
struck vera as ominous her heart
quailed and the vague hesitation of
the last hour formulated into definite
fear she wrenched her arm violently
free of him her doubts showed plain-
ly in her eyes

   i distrust you when you speak like
that she said  i do not believe that
you mean honestly by me i am mind-
ed not to go

  are you stark mad ejaculated
the nobleman beating his clenched
hands together  you must go with
me- that bumpkin your betrothed
would not take you back now

   anyway why are you afraid of
me have i not said that i love you
told about all of the luxuries with
which i shall surround you when we get
away from this abominable place
were your protestations of reciprocal
passion mere words that died stillborn
as soon as uttered here last night  am
i nothing to you vera 

  the pupils of the girls eyes widened
perceptibly her nostrils fluttered
she began to breathe fast again

   yes-you are much to me-you are
everything nikolai iaroslaf but you
were so harsh just then i love you
though dreading i know not what
what proof have i that this feeling of
yours for me is not more than a pass-
ing fancy 

  for an instant the man hesitated
staring at her then suddenly he
thrust pne hand into the bosom of his
coat and drew forth a dull gold neck-
lace to which was attached an old-
fashioned locket he pressed it into
her unwilling hands

   open the locket said he  see
that is a miniature of my mother the
countess feodor vlaseiovitch mas-
ter portraitcur to his imperial highness
painted it

  then before the girl could protest
or deter him the nobleman slipped the
chain over her head and shoved the
locket down into the bosom of her
dress

   wear the most precious thing i
possess cried he  that locket was
my mothers deathbed gift to me it
is yours in proof that i love you truly
now are you convinced shy heart 
the girl wavered before the hot ap-
peal in his eyes and then gave herself
impulsively into his arms


the aee-story magazine

   i believe all you say i will go with
you nikolai she said unbidden tears
welling slowly out from under her
drooped eyelids

  the nobleman kissed her hastily and
took her up bodily in his arms

   we must hurry i will carry you
to the droshky cried he with the
thrill of exultation in his voice

  as he turned to execute his words
janos the boar hound rose up out of
the long grass his throaty snarl halt-
ed the mans precipitate steps

  he let vera slip to her feet on the
ground again and one hand stole into
the side-pocket of his coat

  back janos-home with you
commanded the girl stamping her foot
and trying to cow the animal which
refused to pay any attention to her

  keeping her eyes fixed fast on those
of the dog she took reassuring hold of
one of her companions hands and tried
to pass on the dogs dewlaps curled
farther back and every coarse hair on
his back seemed to stand on end the
ugly rumble of his growl warned them
against movement

  in answer nikolai laroslaf leaped
suddenly forward and struck at the
beast with his heavy riding crop
janos sprang at his aggressors throat

  there came the sudden flash and
stunning report of a pistol that mingled
with a yelp of agony as the hound fell
backward

  the echoes of the shot went booming
across the silence of the place the
nobleman caught veras hand and
pulled her after him

 run he shouted we have
awakened your friends now the
speed of my horses is our only chance
for it 

  hand in hand they raced to where
the thoroughbreds were prancing be-
fore the droshky it was the work of
but an instant to loosen their hobbles
and make the long whip whine over
their heads

  the horses were off with a bound
and a tossing of heads they took to
their task like racers as they dashed

out upon the beaten highway threaten-
ing shouts arose behind them

   oh  whispered the girl white-
lipped  they are after us  she
shrunk closer against her grim-faced
companion whose eyes were fixed
straight ahead  do you think they
can catch us lover  

  the noblemans harsh laugh was
carried away soundless by the rush of
the wind past their ears

   let them try to at their peril he
said  i never have heard of but one
peasant who manhandled a boyar of the
empire and the governor crucified him
head downward at utskow last sum-
mer

  the road was rutted deep with the
dust of four rainless months thick upon
it the droshky creaked and rocked
dangerously from side to side as it was
hurtled madly along behind the pound-
ing hoofs of nikolai iaroslafs thor-
oughbreds

  coveys of little white birds were
scared out of their shelter in the way-
side grasses and rose into the air with
querulous cries all about the fugitives
as the sun rose higher the dust thick-
ened

  it got into their eyes mouths hair
and nostrils it coated the sleek sides
of the horses thickly when the head-
long gallop at which their driver kept
them began to tell on the beasts spume
began to edge their bits and to lather
the chafing harness trickles of sweat
ran like shiny threads down along their
dust-caked bodies

  yet the speed did not slacken nor
did nikolai laroslaf pay any heed to
the pitiful figure huddled up beside him
had he indeed looked he would have
observed that veras lips were moving
in inarticulate prayer

  her glances every now and then
were cast wildly in the direction
whence they fled she kept asking
herself

   is all this truly real  is it not a
nightmare will i not awaken and
find that i have been asleep 

  people were just getting up to go
love goes blindly



about their daily tasks in obtrusk-
cousin olgas village-when the ca-
reening equipage dashed through its
single street the yet sleepy-eyed
countrymen ran to right and left in
frantic haste to avoid the ruthless
hoofs they stared after the dwindling
cloud of yellow dust in the droshkys
wake asking each other 

   by the rood good man what was
that is it some courier riding upon
the little fathers business 

  one old crone peering from her
window affirmed this conjecture

   i saw the czars insignia on the
drivers cloak said she

  ten minutes later they were more
truly informed by four fellow-peasants
who thundered into their excited midst
on blown plow-horses the riders
were helped stiffly down from their
saddleless mounts and gulped down
two or three jugs of water apiece be-
fore they could speak

  then the eldest of the quartet shook
back the tangled mane of hair from
before his dirt-rimmed eyes and spread
out his arms before the gaping crowd

   look at me people  he cried
 do you not recognize me  i am old
yakof your neighbor-an upright
man known to you all

   it is true-that is indeed old
yakof  exclaimed a dozen voices in
unison

  men and women crowded about
mouthing eager questions as to why he
rode there in such haste and at such an
hour

   listen listen good friends 
shouted the old man above the babel
 a rascal has carried off my daugh-
ter-laughing little v era-you all
know and like her did not a droshky
pass through here a little while ago
she my pure bird was in it for the
love of the saints give us fresh horses
and help us in the pursuit 

   what is that you say an abduc-
tion little vera whom tomasz was
to marry who is the villain  and
so on-a great chatter interspersed
with righteous curses and adjurations

to the saints in the midst of it all
fresh horses and new recruits to hunt
down the unknownravisher

  meanwhile the fugitives had gained
ground and felt more assured of escape
though nikolai iaroslaf did not permit
the pace to slacken because of that

  they dashed through several other
villages where the smell of cooking
food tantalized their nostrils and re-
minded them of their hitherto disre-
garded appetites yet they dared not
pause the risk was still too great

  by nightfall they came to the edge
of the great svold forest which all
afternoon had lain like an approaching
cloud on the horizon before them

   safe for a while at least breathed
the nobleman as the tree-boles closed in
behind the equipage and the last rays
of the sun were blotted out in the
mysterious- whispering twilight of the
wood

  vera caught her breath sharply but
made no answering comment she was
too familiar with countryside super-
stitions to feel at ease in that lowering
forest at night-time

  the road was a mere zigzag wagon-
track and the nobleman perforce let
the horses make their own pace which
was slow their sides heaved and
their heads hung with nostrils dis-
tended welcoming the moist coolness
round them

  by and by they came upon a little
glade where a glimpse of the darkening
sky could be had through the leaves
and where the sward was sweet-smell-
ing with dew of their own accord the
horses stopped to crop the grass and
count nikolai came out of his black
reverie with a start he turned to his
companion

   we may as well get out here and
stretch ourselves while we have the
chance said he studying the white
drawn face the girl presented

  he helped her out of the droshky
stiffly and rubbed her arms and ankles
until the numbness in them was suc-
ceeded by aches that showed how the
blood was circulating freely again he


the all-story magazine

held her close up against him and kissed
her wan face

  the caresses unnerved the girl

  i am hungry-oh so hungry ni-
kolai she whimpered

   and so am i dear heart answered
he  but i have only this drink some
it will sustain you until we can get to
utskow in the morning

  she opened her lips obediently as he
tilted the flask up against them and
she coughed until the tears stood in
her eyes as the vodka scorched her
throat she did not like the taste of
it but the burning warmth that almost
immediately swept through her veins
was welcome and made her more her
old self

   let me rest a bit she sighed
drooping against his shoulder  just
a little while lover and then we shall
go on again

  count nikolai spread his cloak out
on the grass and sat cross-legged with
vera curled up in front of him her
head in his lap and one arm encircling
his waist she heaved a great sigh of
weariness

  away up above stars were beginning
to twinkle frostily in the sky the
tree-trunks were gray and ghostly
bearded with moss and reverberant
with the good night chirps of little
birds somewhere off in the depths of
the forest an owl hooted in melancholy
fashion

  the girls lids dropped and she let
her body relax

  presently she slept

iv

  what it was that finally awakened
her she could not tell her eyes flashed
open with sleep scared out of them
her every sense was keenly alert she
felt as if some terrible thing were
skulking just out of arms reach there
in the blackness ready to pounce down
upon her yet there was no sound nor
sign to confirm her apprehension

  count nikolais chin had dropped to
his chest and he also drowsed the

night dew had dampened his hair until
it hung down over his forehead giving
him a wild and haggard look the
horses were still browsing a few yards
away

  vera listened intently her very
breath suspended no sound the
vast silence of the forest seemed
palpable almost the girl had to choke
back a hysterical impulse to scream at
the top of her lungs

  it was there-there she knew it
was she could not hear it nor see it
-could not tell what it was-but she
was sense-conscious of a lurking
menace close to her

  nikolai nikolai lover she
hissed gripping the sleeping man
frantically by the arms awake i
am afraid  there is something here  
the nobleman was startled into sud-
den consciousness and his awakening
ejaculation was barely smothered by
the girls hand on his lips then cau-
tion came to him his hand slipped
into his coat-pocket and emerged again
grasping his pistol

  what is it vera he whispered
uneasily  what have you seen 
what frightened you

   i dont know but it is here-over
there-all around us in the shadows of
the trees   she gasped making a brave
effort to retain self-control  it is
nothing that i have actually seen or
heard but i can feel it-seem to sense
red eyes staring ikt us

  count nikolais fingers tightened
round the pistol-butt and his eyes nar-
rowed as lie strove in vain to pierce
the gloom which surrounded the open
place in which they sat inch by inch
he drew his feet up- under him until
he could push the girl aside and spring
up with leveled weapon shouting

   come out from behind those trees-
you dogs stand fortn or i fire 

  the dismal echoes were his only
response vera had risen too with
her legs shaking under her

   i am so afraid lover she shud-
dered clinging to him  let us go
away from here quickly let us get
love goes blindly



in the droshky and hurry out of this
dreadful wood 

  her companion tried to dissemble his
uneasiness by a nervous laugh

   you must be mistaken child said
he  there seems to be nothing here

  he turned to unhobble the horses
and as he did so vera heard the leaves
rustle on the other side of the clear-
ing a pair of burning eyes met her
stricken stare and almost ere the
shriek of warning had escaped her lips
count nikolai had seized her around
the waist and bounded into the shelter
of the trees behind them both were
breathless and aquiver

   it was tomasz-it was tomasz
with fearful glaring eyes  shivered
the girl  they have overtaken us
we are lost 

  count nikolais lips set grimly into
a straight line holding her by one
hand he dodged away from the dan-
gerous proximity from tree-trunk to
tree-trunk he kept his eyes and pistol
directed in the direction whence they
fled

  then came a crackle in the under-
brush to their left and the fugitives
changed their course only to be ab-
ruptly halted a few seconds later by
similar sounds both before them and
on their right hand

   trapped  snarled count nikolai
baring his white teeth like a wild ani-
mal at bay

  the cordon was closing in round
them

  the man and the girl crouched down
among the wet foliage and waited
then all sounds of pursuit ceased and
an ominous quiet again reigned

  they hid there ten fifteen twenty
minutes-hours long it seemed to them
-and heard nothing it was nerve-
racking unbearable in a frenzy the
nobleman leaped to his feet and bel-
lowed for them to come at him-to dare
lay a finger-tip on him a boyar of the
empire

  then they came-nine of them all
told though seeming to be a score or
more by reason of the fantasy of those

eery surroundings they came they
stamped gnashed teeth spat guttural
curses clenched clawed

  the counts pistol snapped in their
contorted faces but did not explode
he had forgotten to reload it after
shooting janos the boarhound

  he felt huge sinewy arms strain
terrifically round him until his ribs
seemed caving inward

  one peasant trampled under foot
screamed horribly and sank his teeth
into the calf of the battling noblemans
leg

  old yakof was pulling out the
counts mustache by the roots with
his stubby thumbs some one else tried
to gouge out nikolai iaroslafs eyes

  down went the fighting man with his
snarling aggressors heaped upon him

  the heart-breaking pressure upon his
ribs never relaxed

  foul breath was hot on his face
his jaws hung open as he gasped for
breath and tore frantically at the ears
noses and hair on faces which his
blurring eyes could no longer distin-
guish faintly as if from a great dis-
tance he heard appalling shrieks in a
voice that he seemed to know

  he was suffocating his brain
worked slowly but very methodically

  where had he heard that voice be-
fore it was not that of the princess
xenia could it be that of the dashing
mile alix petrovna to whom men
bowed all along the nevsky prospekt
then there avas-

  ah the little peasant girl avith the
eyes blue as corn-flowers and the
charming smile-the child avho so liked
to hae him-

   vera avheezed the prostrate man
and avondered at the murky haze that
avas asavim before his eyes  vera

v

  consciousness returned to vera
the betrothed avith a rush the horror
and dearastation of avhich was like the
sweep of a tidal avave

she avas literally submerged through


the all-story magazine

the opened flood-gates of her senses
and spiritually drowning opeifed dry
colorless lips to cry out to scream
shriek yell hideously

  she was lying there in her bare
little cheerless room with the rosin
oozing ocloriferously through the pine
walls and the tattered old skirt hung
over the unglazed window

  everything about her was familiar
nothing was changed except her inner
being

  she screeched raucously in mental
nausea in a trice twenty well-known
and beloved faces were about her bed-
side and half a dozen women with arms
outstretched to mother her

  vera-child child what is it
they cried and another voice-that of
tomasz-said anxiously

    tell us

  the girl pushed them frantically
away from her and sat up in bed-eyes
staring and vacant lips parted in a
senile way her voice was a mere
whisper

   murderers - murderers-murder-
ers   she croaked  you have killed
him-killed him  

  a babel of ejaculations broke loose
round her old yakof stared per-
plexedly at his good wife red-lipped
olga shrank back with a little cry
against tomaszs stalwart form the
lover seemed to gape his incredulity of
the avords that grated from his be-
trotheds lips

   why dont you speak   the girl
rasped gritting strong avhite teeth so
that all there could hear her  why
dont you say something-laugh-ad-
mit that you did this thing

   are you afraid noav that you have
made away avith a boyar are you
thinking of nooses and the gallows by
the crossroads avith yourselves strung
up there swinging in the avind like
scarecroavs 

   you old yakof-you avho begot
me-gouged out his eye avith that
thumb and you tomasz stamped him
flat avith your nail-hobbed boots oh
i saav murderers lying there still

fighting avith blood puddled in the
dead leaaes murderers murder-
ers  

  vera shouted old yakof com-
mandingly and upraised both arms
like a priest exorcising some poor soul
possessed of a devil

  a dozen aroices avhispered  mad
poor tomasz 

  the bridegroom dropped to his
knees by the bed appeal on his face
an old avoman-she had suckled vera
in infancy-pushed him to one side
and put her two arms around the
quivering exhausted figure on the bed

   go aavay you foolish people she
cried  dont all stand there staring
like boobies cant you see that this i
nothing the poor child has had the
nightmare

   a dream-she is still in the travail
of some aavful dream the avedding
guests and relatives chorused and sev-
eral laughed throatily in their relief
 why did ave not think of that before
but oh iioav she startled us 

  rank contempt curled the girls lips
 so you are really cowards as avell
as murderers she accused them
 do not try to fool me so i dream
indeed haare i slept for a avhole day
and a night then  i ask you that  

   slept for a day and a night
what is she talking about   the en-
semble asked each other the old nurse
avaved them pettishly back again and
addressed herself to the girl avith in-
finite patience

   you are unstrung my dear said
she  you must haae eaten something
that did not agree avith you at the bridal
dinner no day has passed since then
see child you still haae on the bridal
dress just as you left us to come in
here from the table last night

   you must have throavn yourself
on the bed to doze for a minute before
undressing and then this hallucination
came to you be yourself this is
your avedding morn and it is time ave
avere on the way to scurocz avhere
father ivan aavaits us avith bell book
and candle
love goes blindly



   observe the anxiety into which
your wild words have thrown tomasz
-good tomasz who is to be your hus-
band your outcry awoke us from
sound sleep

  vera stared dully down at her limbs
and saw indeed the bridal dress
rumpled from her tossing about on the
bed through the open door she noted
that the oaken trestle still bore the re-
mains of the wedding feast her
senses reeled unsteadily and she passed
shaking hands slowly across her clam-
my forehead five or six times

   but but- she whispered

  sense was gradually coming back
into her eyes the old woman soothed
her as one would an infant

  tomasz secured one of her hands
and stroked it tenderly

  he kissed it and said

   i love you vera

  red blood coursed through the girls
veins again and pushing aside the
watchers she slid shakily to the floor
a sense of peace embalmed her soul
and she let tomasz draw her slowly
into the strong security of his embrace

   i am so tired dear tomasz she
sighed  but i am ready to go now
to father ivan if you are i am glad
that it was only a dream

then everybody clapped their hands
 this is as it should be  they cried
let us be off hurry good wife
come brothers hey for the brides
candles and old father ivan 

  so the wedding procession was
formed and with bright holiday rib-
bons flaunting the little company took
the road to scurocz

  most of the men walked striding
along in time to the music of an un-
kempt fiddler who pranced in their
lead

  occasionally they would burst into
powerful chesty song-plaintive folk-
strains about the goodliness of hus-
bandry or of the lusty sons that come
to cheer declining years

  the women of the cortege either
rode bareback astraddle of the shaggy
ponies or sat up very prim and stiff in

unaccustomed bodice lacings in the
bullock-carts

  vera sat deep in the straw-bedded
bottom of one of these with her
mother her two buxom sisters and
cousin olga from obtrusk while
tomasz walked steadily alongside his
one hand on the edge of the cart and
his eyes fixed on those of his betrothed

  when their glances met rosy blood
would suffuse the girls face and neck
and tingle down to her finger-tips her
heart beat fast and irregularly through-
out that long jolting ride

  all scurocz turned out to welcome
the bridal party with huzzas and the
throwing of millet seeds which is ac-
counted a propitious thing in those
parts

  decrepit father ivan met them
watery-eyed and vacuous-faced in the
doorway of the weatherbeaten little
church

  as they passed-two by two each
man ahold of his womans hand-be-
neath the dingy gilt greek cross above
the doorway all bobbed their heads and
took on a solemn expression of face

  high mass was celebrated and the
formulae gone through that made one
flesh of man and maid even as the
patriarchs had decreed those things
centuries ago in the days of the great
schism

  the names of tomasz and of vera
his wife were laboriously inscribed
upon the parish register and father
ivan blessed them with the fervor of
one to whom much largess had been
promised

  with the drone of the benediction
in her ears and the ecstatic grip of her
husbands fingers on her hand veras
thoughts strayed out over the eddies
of candle-smoke on the altar and the
bowed heads of her kneeling relatives

   a dream-they assured me that it
was all but a dream she kept telling
herself  ave maria ave maria
yes yes it must have been a dream

  the wild music of the fiddler broke
out again beyond the doorway feet
shuffled as the assemblage got stiffly on


the aee-story magazine

its feet and made slow progress out of
the interior gloom into the shimmer of
morning sunlight on the green fields

  tomasz plucked at veras arm half
timidly half with a sense of the new
proprietorship that was his they too
passed out of the church and stood
blinking in the light with their friends

   my wife  said tomasz choking-
ly and drew her to him with strong
arms that quivered

  vera gave herself submissively to
his will-felt how his lips strained to
suffocation upon hers

  a cry suddenly burst from her and
she tore herself loose from his hold
one hand she pressed instinctively to
her heaving bosom and the other went

to her throat bare above the open collar
of her blouse

  something felt cold and hard against
her warm flesh beneath the pressure
of her fingers--something the chill of
which sent a tremor through her

  her fingers closed round the object
and she pulled it forth covertly as far
as the gold chain attaching it to her
neck would allow

  eler hands held an old-fashioned
locket in which reposed a painted
miniature

  dully as if far away but still echo-
ing through the caverns of memory she
seemed to hear said 

   keep it it is the most precious
thing i possess

chapter i

on the river iss

  n the shadows of the forest that
flanks the crimson plain by the side
of the lost sea of ivorus in the
valley dor beneath the hurtling moons
of mars speeding their meteoric way
close above the bosom of the dying
planet i crept stealthily along the trail
of a shadowy form that hugged the
darker places with a consistency that
proclaimed the sinister nature of its
errand

  for six long martian months i had
haunted the vicinity of the hateful
temple of the sun within whose slow-
revolving shaft far beneath the sur-
face of mars my princess lay en-
tombed-but whether alive or dead i
knew not had phaidors slim blade
found that beloved heart time only
would reveal the truth

  six hundred and eighty-seven mar-
tian days must come and go before the
cells door would again come opposite
the tunnels end where last i had seen
my ever-beautiful dejah thoris

                     tfaegods of mars

  half of them had passed or would
on the morrow yet vivid in my mem-
ory obliterating every event that had
come bet ore or after there remained
the last scene before the gust of smoke
blinded my eyes and the narrow slit
that had given me sight of the interior
of her cell closed between me and the
princess of helium for a long martian
year

  as if it were yesterday i still saw
the beautiful face of phaidor daugh-
ter of matai shang distorted with
jealous rage and hatred as she sprang
forward with raised dagger upon the
woman i loved

  i saw the red girl thuvia of ptarth
leap forward to prevent the hideous
deed

  the smoke from the burning temple
had come then to blot out the tragedy
but in my ears rang the single shriek
as the knife fell then silence and
when the smoke had cleared the re-
volving temple had shut off all sight
or sound from the chamber in which
the three beautiful women were im-
prisoned

  much there had been to occupy my
attention since that terrible moment
but never for an instant had the mem-
ory of the thing faded and all the
time that i could spare from the nu-
merous duties that had devolved upon
me in the reconstruction of the gov-
ernment of the first born since our
victorious fleet and land forces had
overwhelmed them had been spent
close to the grim shaft that held the
mother of my boy carthoris of
helium

  the race of blacks that for ages had
worshiped issus the false deity of
mars had been left in a state of chaos
by my revealment of her as naught
more than a wicked old woman in
their rage they had torn her to pieces

  from the high pinnacle of their
egotism the first born had been
plunged to the depths of humiliation
their deity was gone and with her the
whole false fabric of their religion
their vaunted navy had fallen in de-

feat before the superior ships and
fighting men of the red men of helium

  fierce green warriors from the
ocher sea-bottoms of outer mars had
ridden their wild thoats across the sa-
cred gardens of the temple of issus
and tars tarkas jeddak of thark
fiercest of them all had sat upon the
throne of issus and ruled the first
born while the allies were deciding the
conquered nations fate

  almost unanimous was the request
that i ascend the ancient throne of the
black men even the first born them-
selves concurring in it but i would
have none of it my heart could never
be with the race that had heaped in-
dignities upon my princess and my son

  at my suggestion xodar became
jeddak of the first born he had
been a dator or prince until issus had
degraded him so that his fitness for
the high office avas unquestioned

  the peace of the valley dor thus
assured the green warriors dispersed
to their desolate sea-bottoms while
we of helium returned to our own
country here again avas a throne of-
fered me since no avord had been re-
ceived from the missing jeddak of
helium tardos mors grandfather of
dejah thoris or his son mors kajak
jed of helium her father

  over a year had elapsed since they
had set out to explore the northern
hemisphere in search of carthoris and
at last their disheartened people had
accepted as truth the vague rumors of
their death that had filtered in from
the frozen region of the pole

  once again i refused a throne for
i would not belieare that the mighty
tardos mors or his no less redoubt-
able son was dead

   let one of their own blood rule
you until they return i said to the
assembled nobles of  helium as i ad-
dressed them from the pedestal of
truth beside the throne of righteous-
ness in the temple of reavard from
the aery ot avhere i had stood a year
before avhen zat arras pronounced the
sentence of death upon me


the all-story magazine

  as i spoke i stepped forward and
laid my hand upon the shoulder of
carthoris where he stood in the front
rank of the circle of nobles about me

  as one the nobles and the people
lifted their voices in a long cheer of
approbation ten thousand swords
sprang on high from as many scab-
bards and the glorious fighting men
of ancient helium hailed carthoris
jecldak of helium

  his tenure of office was to be for
life or until his great-grandfather or
grandfather should return having
thus satisfactorily arranged this im-
portant duty for helium i started the
following day for the valley dor that
i might remain close to the temple of
the sun until the fateful day that
should see the opening of the prison-
cell where my lost love lay buried

  hor vastus and kantos kan with
my other noble lieutenants i left with
carthoris at helium that he might
have the benefit of their wisdom
bravery and loyalty in the perform-
ance of the arduous duties which had
devolved upon him only woola my
martian hound accompanied me

  at my heels to - night the faithful
beast moved softly in my tracks as
large as a shetland pony with hideous
head and frightful fangs he was in-
deed an awesome spectacle as he crept
after me on his ten short muscular
legs but to me he was the embodiment
of love and royalty

  the figure ahead was that of the
black dator of the first born thurid
whose undying enmity i had earned
that time i laid him low with my
bare hands in the courtyard of the
temple of issus and bound him with
his own harness before the noble men
and women who had but a moment
before been extolling his prowess

  like many of his fellows he had
apparently accepted the new order of
things with good grace and had sworn
fealty to xodar his new ruler but i
knew that he hated me and i was sure
that in his heart he envied and hated
xodar so i had kept a watch upon his

comings and goings to the end that i
had become convinced that he was occu-
pied with some manner of intrigue

  several times i had observed him
leaving the walled city of the first
born after dark taking his way out
into the cruel and horrible valley dor
where  honest business could lead
any man

  to-night he moved quickly along the
edge of the forest until well beyond
sight or sound of the city then he
turned across the crimson sward to-
ward the shore of the lost sea of
korus

  the rays of the nearer moon swing-
ing low across the valley touched his
jewel - incrusted harness with a thou-
sand changing lights and glanced from
the glossy ebony of his smooth hide
twice he turned his head back toward
the forest after the manner of one
avho is upon an evil errand though he
must have felt quite safe from pursuit

  i did not dare follow him there be-
neath the moonlight since it best suit-
ed my plans not to interrupt his - i
wished him to reach his destination un-
suspecting that i might learn just
where that destination lay and the
business that awaited the night prowler
there

  so it was that i remained hidden
until after thurid had disappeared
over the edge of the steep bank beside
the sea a quarter of a mile away then
with woola following i hastened
across the open after the black dator

  the quiet of the tomb lay upon the
mysterious valley of death crouching
deep in its warm nest within the
sunken area at the south pole of the
dying planet in the far distance the
golden cliffs raised their mighty bar-
rier faces far into the starlit heatvens
the precious metals and scintillating
jewels that composed them sparkling
in the brilliant light of marss two
gorgeous moons

  at my back was the mighty forest
pruned and trimmed like the sward to
parklike symmetry by the browsing of
the ghoulish plant men
warlord of mars



  before me lay the lost sea of
korus while farther on i caught the
shimmering ribbon of iss the river
of mystery where it wound out from
beneath the golden cliffs to empty
into the lost sea of korus to which
for countless ages had been borne the
deluded and unhappy martians of the
outer world upon the voluntary pil-
grimage to this false heaven

  the plant men with their blood-
sucking hands and the monstrous
white apes that make dor hideous by
day were hidden in their lairs for the
night

  there was no longer a holy thern
upon the balcony in the golden cliffs
above the iss to summon them with
weird cry to the victims floating down
to their maws upon the cold broad
bosom of ancient iss

  the navies of helium and the first
born had cleared the fortresses and the
temples of the therns when they had
refused to surrender and accept the
new order of things that had swept
their false religion from long-suffer-
ing mars

  in a few isolated countries they still
retained their age-old power but
matai shang their hekkador father
of therns had been driven from his
temple strenuous had been our en-
deavors to capture him but with a
few of the faithful he had escaped
and was in hiding - where we knew
not

  as i came cautiously to the edge of
the low cliff overlooking the lost sea
of korus i saw thurid pushing out
upon the bosom of the shimmering
avater in a small skiff-one of those
strangely wrought craft of unthink-
able age which the holy therns with
their organization of priests and lesser
therns were wont to distribute along
the banks of the iss that the long
journey of their victims might be
facilitated

  drawn up upon the beach below me
were a score of similar boats each with
its long pole at one end of which was
a pike at the other a paddle thurid

     s

was hugging the shore and as he
passed out of sight round a near-by
promontory i shoved one of the boats
into the water and calling woola into
it pushed out from shore

  the pursuit of thurid carried me
along the edge of the sea toward the
mouth of the iss the farther moon
lay close to the horizon casting a dense
shadow beneath the cliffs that fringed
the water thnria the nearer moon
had set nor would it rise again for
near four hours so that i was insured
concealing darkness for that length of
time at least

  on and on went the black warrior
now he was opposite the mouth of the
iss without an instants hesitation
lie turned up the grim river paddling
hard again the strong current

  after him came woola and i closer
now for the man avas too intent upon
forcing his craft up the river to haae
any eyes for what might be transpiring
behind him he hugged the shore out
of the main channel avhere the current
avas less strong

  presently he came to the dark caar-
ernoifc portal in the face of the golden
cliffs through which the mer poured
on into the stygian darkness beyond
he urged his craft

  it seemed hopeless to attempt to fol-
low him here avhere i could not see my
hand before my face and i was almost
on the point of giving up the pursuit
and drifting back to the mouth of the
river there to await his return avhen
a sudden bend showed a faint lumi-
nosity ahead

  my quarry avas plainly visible again
and in the increasing light from the
phosphorescent rock that lay embedded
in great patches in the roughly arched
roof of the cavern i had no difficulty
in following him

  it avas my first trip upon the bosom
of iss and the things i saav there avill
liare foreaer in my memory

  terrible as they avere they could
not have commenced to approximate
the horrible conditions avhich must
haate obtained before tars tarkas the


the all-story magazine

great green warrior xodar the black
dator and i brought the light of truth
to the outer world and stopped the mad
rush of millions upon the voluntary
pilgrimage to what they believed would
end in a beautiful valley of peace and
happiness and love

  even now the low islands which
dotted the broad stream were choked
with the skeletons of those who
through fear or a sudden awakening
to the truth had halted almost at the
completion of their journey

  in the awful stench of these fright-
ful charnel isles haggard maniacs
screamed and gibbered and fought
among the torn remnants of their
grisly feasts while on those which
contained but clean-picked bones they
battled with one another the weaker
furnishing sustenance for the stronger
or with clawlike hands clutched at the
bodies that drifted down with the
current

  thurid paid not the slightest atten-
tion to the screaming things that either
menaced or pleaded with him as the
mood directed them-evidently he was
familiar with the horrid sights that
surrounded him he continued up the
river for perhaps a mile and then
crossing over to the left bank drew
his craft up on a low ledge that lay
almost on a level with the water

  i dared not follow across the stream
for he most surely would have seen
me instead i stopped close to the
opposite wall beneath an overhanging
mass of rock that cast a dense shadow
beneath it here i could watch thurid
without danger of discovery

  the black was standing upon the
ledge beside his boat looking up the
river as though he were awaiting one
whom he expected from that direction

  as i lay there beneath the dark rocks
i noticed that a strong current seemed
to flow directly toward the center of
the river so that it was difficult to
hold my craft in its position i edged
farther into the shadow that i might
find a hold upon the bank but though
i proceeded several yards i touched

nothing and then finding that i would
soon reach a point from where i could
no longer see the black man i was
compelled to remain where i was
holding my position as best i could by
paddling strongly against the current
which flowed from beneath the rocky
mass behind me

  i could not imagine what might
cause this strong lateral flow for the
main channel of the river was plainly
visible to me from where i sat and i
could see the rippling junction of it
and the mysterious current which had
aroused my curiosity

  while i was still speculating upon
the phenomenon my attention was sud-
denly riveted upon thurid who had
raised both palms forward above his
head in the universal salute of
martians and a moment later his
 kaor  the barsoomian word of
greeting came in low but distinct
tones

  i turned my eyes up the river in the
direction that his were bent andpres-
ently there came within my limited
range of vision a long boat in which
were six men five were at the pad-
dles while the sixth sat in the seat of
honor at the bow

  the white skins the flowing yellow
wigs which covered their bald pates
and the gorgeous diadems set in cir-
clets of gold about their heads marked
them as holy therns

  as they drew up beside the ledge
upon which thurid awaited them he
in the bow of the boat arose to step
ashore and then i saw that it was none
other than matai shang father of
therns

  the evident cordiality with which
the two men exchanged greetings filled
me with wonder for the black and
white men of barsoom were heredi-
tary enemies-not ever before had i
known of two meeting other than in
battle

  evidently the reverses that had re-
cently overtaken both peoples had re-
sulted in an alliance between these two
individuals-at least against the com-
warlord of mars



mon enemy - and now i saw why
thurid had come so often out into the
valley dor by night and that the na-
ture of his conspiring might be such
as to strike close to me or my friends

  i wished that i might have found
a point closer to the two men from
which to have heard their conversa-
tion but it was out of the question
now to attempt to cross the river and
so i lay quietly watching them who
would have given so much to have
known how close i lay to them and
how easily they might have overcome
and killed me with their superior force

  several times thurid pointed across
the river in my direction but that his
gestures had any reference to me i did
not for a moment believe presently
he and matai shang entered the lat-
ters boat which turned out into the
river and swinging round forged
steadily across in my direction

  as they advanced i moved my boat
farther and farther in beneath the
overhanging wall but at last it became
evident thax their craft was holding
the same course the five paddlers
sent the larger boat ahead at a speed
that taxed my energies to equal

  every instant i expected to feel my
prow crash against solid rock the
light from the river was no longer visi-
ble but ahead i saw the faint tinge of
a distant radiance and still the water
before me was open

  at last the truth dawned upon me-
i was following a subterranean river
which emptied into the iss at the very
point where i had hidden

  the rowers were now quite close to
me the noise of their own paddles
drowned the sound of mine but in an-
other instant the growing light ahead
would reveal me to them

  there was no time to be lost what-
ever action i was to take must be taken
at once swinging the prow of my
boat toward the right i sought the
rivers rocky side and there i lay while
matai shang and thurid approached
up the center of the stream which was
much narrower than the iss

  as they came nearer i heard the
voices of thurid and the father of
therns raised in argument

   i tell you them the black dator
wras saying  that i wish only venge-
ance upon john carter prince of
helium i am leading you into no
trap what could i gain by betraying
you to those who have ruined my na-
tion and my house  

   let us stop here a moment that
i may hear your plans replied the
hekkador  and then we may proceed
with a better understanding of our
duties and obligations

  to the rowers he issued the com-
mand that brought their boat in toward
the bank not a dozen paces beyond the
spot where i lay

  had they pulled in below me they
must surely have seen me against the
faint glow of light ahead but from
where they finally came to rest i was
as secure from detection as though
miles separated us

  the few words i had already over-
heard whetted my curiosity and i was
anxious to learn what manner of
vengeance thurid was planning against
me nor had i long to wait i listened
intently

   there are no obligations father
of therns continued the first born
 thurid dator of issus has no price
when the thing has been accomplished
i shall be glad if you will see to it that
i am well received as is befitting my
ancient lineage and noble rank at some
court that is yet loyal to thy ancient
faith for i cannot return to the val-
ley dor or elsewhere within the power
of the prince of helium but even that
i do not demand-it shall be as your
own desire in the matter directs

   it shall be asyou wish dator re-
plied matai shang  nor is that all-
power and riches shall be yours if you
restore my daughter phaidor to me
and place within my power dejah
thoris princess of helium

   ah he continued with a ma-
licious snarl  but the earth-man shall
suffer for the indignities he has put


the ale-story magazine

upon the holy of holies nor shall any
vileness be too vile to inflict upon his
princess would that it were in my
power to force him to witness the hu-
miliation and degradation of the red
woman

   you shall have your way with her
before another day has passed matai
shang said thurid  if you but say
the word

   i have heard of the temple of the
sun dator replied matai shang
 but never have i heard that its pris-
oners could be released before the al-
lotted year of their incarceration had
elapsed how then may you accom-
plish the impossible  

   access may be had to any cell of
the temple at any time replied thu-
rid  only issus knew this nor was
it ever dssuss way to divulge more of
her secrets than were necessary by
chance after her death i came upon
an ancient plan of the temple and
there i found plainly writ the most
minute directions for reaching the
cells at any time

   and more i learned - that many
men had gone thither for issus in the
past always on errands of death and
torture to the prisoners but those who
thus learned the secret way were wont
to die mysteriously immediately they
had returned and made their reports
to issus

   let us proceed then said matai
shang at last  i must trust you yet
at the same time you must trust me
for we are six to your one

   i do not fear replied thurid
 nor need you our hatred of the
common enemy is sufficient bond to in-
sure our loyalty to one another and
after we have defiled the princess of
helium there will q still greater rea-
son for the maintenance of our alle-
giance - unless  greatly mistake the
temper of her lord

  matai shang spoke to the paddlers
the boat moved on up the tributary

  it was with difficulty that i re-
strained myself from rushing upon
them and slaying the two vile plotters

but quickly i saw the mad rashness of
such an act which would cut down the
only man who could lead the way to
dejali thoriss prison before the long
martian year had swung its intermi-
nable circle

  if he should lead matai shang to
that hallowed spot then too should
he lead john carter prince of helium

  with silent paddle i swung slowly
into the wake of the larger craft

chapter ii

under thu mountains

  as we advanced up the river which
winds beneath the golden cliffs out of
the bowels of the mountains of otz to
mingle its dark waters with the grim
and mysterious iss the faint glow
which had appeared before us grew
gradually into an all-enveloping radi-
ance

  the river widened until it presented
the aspect of a large lake whose vault-
ed dome lighted by glowing phosphor-
escent rock was splashed with the
vivid rays of the diamond the sap-
phire the ruby and the countless
nameless jewels of barsoom which lay
incrusted in the virgin gold which
forms the major portion of these mag-
nificent cliffs

  beyond the lighted chamber of the
lake was darkness - what lay behind
the darkness i could not even guess

  to have followed the thern-boat
across the gleaming water would have
been to invite instant detection and so
though i was loath to permit thurid
to pass even for an instant beyond my
sight i was forced to wait in the
shadows until the other boat had
passed from my sight at the far ex-
tremity of the lake then i paddled
out upon the brilliant surface in the
direction they had taken

  when after what seemed an eter-
nity i reached the shadows at the up-
per end of the lake i found that the
river issued from a low aperture to
pass beneath which it was necessary
warlord of mars



that i compel woola to lie flat in the
boat and i myself must need bend
double before the low roof cleared my
head

  immediately the roof rose again
upon the other side but no longer was
the way brilliantly lighted instead
only a feeble glow emanated from
small and scattered patches of phos-
phorescent rock in wall and roof

  directly before me the river ran
into this smaller chamber through
three separate arched openings

  thurid and the therns were no-
where to be seen-into which of the
dark holes had they disappeared
there was no means by which i might
know and so i chose the center open-
ing as being as likely to lead me in the
right direction as another

  here the way was through utter
darkness the stream was narrow-
so narrow that in the blackness i was
constantly bumping first one rocky
avail and then another as the river
avound hit-her and thither along its
flinty bed

  far ahead i presently heard a deep
and sullen roar avhich increased in vol-
ume as i advanced and then broke
upon my ears with all the intensity of
its mad fury as i savung round a sharp
curve into a dimly lighted stretch of
avater

  directly before me the river thun-
dered doavn from above in a mighty
avaterfall that filled the narrow gorge
from side to side rising far above me
several hundred feet - as magnificent
a spectacle as i had ever seen

  but the roar-the aavful deafening
roar of those tumbling avaters penned
in the rocky subterranean vault
had the fall not entirely blocked
my further passage and shoavn me
that i had folloaved the avrong course
i believe that i should have fled any
avay before the maddening tumult

  thurid and the therns could not
haae come this avay by stumbling
upon the avrong course i had lost the
trail and they had gained so much
ahead of me that now i might not be

able to find them before it avas too late
if in fact i could find them at all

  it had taken seaeral hours to force
my avay up to the falls against the
strong current and other hours would
be required for the descent although
the pace would be much shifter

  with a sigh i turned the proav of
my craft down - stream and avith
mighty strokes hastened avith reckless
speed through the dark and tortuous
channel until once again i came to the
chamber into avhich floaved the three
branches of the river

  tavo unexplored channels still re-
mained from avhich to choose nor avas
there any means by avhich i could
judge which was the more likely to
lead me to the plotters

  never in my life that i can recall
haae i suffered such an agony of in-
decision so much depended upon a
correct choice so much depended
upon haste

  the hours that i had already lost
might seal the fate of the incompara-
ble dejah thoris avere she not already
dead-to sacrifice other hours and
maybe days in a fruitless exploration
of another blind lead avould unques-
tionably prove fatal

  seaeral times i essayed the right-
hand entrance only to turn back as
though avarned by some strange intui-
tive sense that this was not the way
at last convinced by the oft-recurring
phenomenon i cast my all upon the
left-hand archway yet it avas avith a
lingering doubt that i turned a part-
ing look at the sullen avaters which
rolled dark and forbidding from be-
neath the ioav arcliavay on the right

  and as i looked there came bobbing
out upon the current from the stygian
darkness of the interior the shell of
one of the great succulent fruits of
the sorapus-tree

  i could scarce restrain a shout of
elation as this silent insensate mes-
senger floated past me on toavard the
iss and korus for it told me that
journeying martians avere abova me
on that very stream


the all-story magazine

  they had eaten of this marvelous
fruit which nature concentrates within
the hard shell of the sorapus nut and
having eaten had cast the husk over-
board it could have come from no
others than the party i sought

  quickly i abandoned all thought of
the left-hand passage and a moment
later had turned into the right the
stream soon widened and recurring
areas of phosphorescent rock lighted
my way

  i made good time but was con-
vinced that i was nearly a day behind
those i was tracking neither woola
nor i had eaten since the previous day
but in so far as he was concerned it
mattered but little since practically all
the animals of the dead sea bottoms of
mars are able to go for incredible
periods without either food or water

  nor did i suffer the water of the
river was sweet and cold for it was
unpolluted by decaying bodies--unlike
the iss-and as for food why the
mere thought that i was nearing my
beloved princess raised me above every
material want

  as i proceeded the river became
narrower and the current swift and
turbulent-so swift in fact that it was
with difficulty that i forced my craft
tipward at all i could not have been
making to exceed a hundred yards an
hour when at a bend i was confront-
ed by a series of rapids through which
the river foamed and boiled at a ter-
rific rate

  my heart sank within me the so-
rapus-nut shell had proved a false
prophet and after all my intuition
had been correct-it was the left-hand
channel that i should have followed

  had i been a woman d should have
wept at my right was a great slow-
moving eddv that circled far beneath
the cliffs overhanging side and to
rest my tired muscles before turning
back i let my boat drift into its em-
brace

  i was almost prostrated by disap-
pointment it would mean another
half-days loss of time to retrace my

way and take the only passage that yet
remained unexplored what fate had
led me to select from three possible
avenues the two that were wrong

  as the lazy current of the eddy car-
ried me slowly about the periphery of
the watery circle my boat twice
touched the rocky side of the river in
the dark recess beneath the cliff a
third time it struck gently as it had
before but the contact resulted in a
different sound - the sound of wood
scraping upon wood

  in an instant i was on the alert for
there could be  wood within that
buried river that had not been man
brought almost coincidently with
my first apprehension of the noise my
hand shot out across the boats side
and a second later i felt my fingers
gripping the gunwale of another craft

  as though turned to stone i sat in
tense and rigid silence straining my
eyes into the utter darkness before me
in an effort to discover if the boat were
occupied

  it was entirely possible that there
might be men  board it who were
still ignorant of my presence for the
boat was scraping gently against the
rocks upon one side so that the gentle
touch of my boat upon the other easily
could have gone unnoticed

  peer as i would i could not pene-
trate the darkness and then i listened
intently for the sound of breathing
near me but except for the noise of
the rapids the soft scraping of the
boats and the lapping of the water at
their sides i could distinguish no
sound

  a rope lay coiled in the bottom of
my own craft very softly i gathered
it up and making one end fast to the
bronze ring in the prow i stepped gin-
gerly into the boat beside me in one
hand i grasped the rope in the other
my keen long-sword

  for a full minute perhaps i stood
motionless after entering the strange
craft it had rocked a trifle beneath
my weight but it had been the scra-
ping of its side against the side of my
warlord

of mars



own boat that had seemed most likely
to alarm its occupants if there were
any

  but there was no answering sound
and a moment later i had felt from
stem to stern and found the boat de-
serted

  groping with my hands along the
face of the rocks to which the craft
was moored il discovered a narrow
ledge which i knew must be the avenue
taken by those who had come before
me that they could be none other
than thurid and his party i was con-
vinced by the size and build of the boat
i had found

  calling to woola to follow me i
stepped out upon the ledge the
great savage brute agile as a cat crept
after me

  as he passed through the boat that
had been occupied by thurid and the
therns he emitted a single low growl
and when he came beside me upon the
ledge and my hand rested upon his neck
i felt his short mane bristling with
anger i think he sensed telepathical-
ly the recent presence of an enemy for
i had made no effort to impart to him
the nature of our quest or the status
of those we tracked

  this omission i now made haste to
correct and after the manner of green
martians with their beasts i let him
know partially by the weird and un-
canny telepathy of barsoom and part-
ly by word  of mouth that we were
upon the trail of those who had re-
cently occupied the boat through which
we had just passed

  a soft purr like that of a great cat
indicated that woola understood and
then with a word to him to follow i
turned to the right along the ledge but
scarcely had i done so than i felt his
mighty fangs tugging at my leathern
harness

  as i turned to discover the cause of
his act he continued to pull me steadi-
ly in the opposite direction nor would
he desist until i had turned about and
indicated that i would follow him vol-
untarily

  never had i known him to be in
error in a matter of tracking so it
was with a feeling of entire security
that i moved cautiously in the huge
beasts wake through cimmerian
darkness he moved along the narrow
ledge beside the boiling rapids

  as we advanced the way led from
beneath the overhanging cliffs out into
a dim light and then it was that i saw
that the trail had been cut from the
living rock and that it ran up along
the rivers side beyond the rapids

  for hours we followed the dark and
gloomy river further and further into
the bowels of mars from the direc-
tion and distance i knew that we must
be well beneath the valley dor and
possibly beneath the sea of omean as
well - it could not be much further
now to the temple of the sun

 even as my mind framed the
thought woola halted suddenly before
a narrow arched doorway in the cliff
by the trails side quickly he crouched
back away from the entrance at the
same time turning his eyes toward me

  words could not have more plainly
told me that danger of some sort lay
near by and so i pressed quietly for-
ward to his side and passing him
looked into the aperture at our right

  before me avas a fair-sized chamber
that from its appointments i kneav
must have at one time been a guard-
room there avere racks for aveapons
and slightly raised platforms for the
sleeping silks and furs of the avarriors
but now its only occupants avere two
of the therns avho had been of the
party avith thurid and matai shang

  the men avere in earnest conversa-
tion and from their tones it was
apparent that they avere entirely
unaware that they had listeners

   i tell you one of them avas say-
ing  i do not trust the black one
there avas no necessity for leaving us
here to guard the avay against aadiat
pray should ave guard this long-for-
gotten abysmal path it was but a
ruse to divide our numbers

   fie will have matai shang leave


the all-story magazine

others elsewhere on some pretext or
another and then at last he will fall
upon us with his confederates and
slay us all

   i believe you labor replied the
other  there can never be aught else
than deadly hatred between thern and
first born and what think you of
the ridiculous matter of the light
 let the light shine with the intensity
of three radium units for fifty tals
and for one zat let it shine with the
intensity of one radium unit and then
for twenty-five tals with nine units
those were his very words and to
think that wise old matai shang
should listen to such foolishness

   indeed it is silly replied lakor
 it will open nothing other than the
way to a quick death for us all he
had to make some answer when matai
shang asked him flatly what he should
do when he came to the temple of the
sun and so he made his answer quick-
ly from his imagination - i would
wager a hekkadors diadem that he
could not now repeat it himself

   let us not remain here longer
lakor spoke the other thern  per-
chance if we hasten after them we
may come in time to rescue matai
shang and wreak our own vengeance
upon the black dator what say-you
 never in a long life answered
lakor  have i disobeyed a single
command of the father of therns i
shall stay here until i rot if lie does
not return to bid me elsewhere
lakors companion shook his head
 you are my superior he said  i
cannot do other than you sanction
though i still believe that we are fool-
ish to remain

  i too thought that they were fool-
ish to remain for i saw from woolas
actions that the trail led through the
room where the two therns held guard
i had no reason to harbor any con-
siderable love for this race of sell-dei-
fied demons yet i would have passed
them by were it possible without mo-
lesting them

  it was worth trying anyway for a

fight might delay us considerably or
even put an end entirely to my search--
better men than i have gone down be-
fore fighters of meaner ability than
that possessed by the thern warriors

  signaling woola to heel i stepped
suddenly into the room before the two
men at sight of me their long-
swords flashed from the harness at
their sides but i raised my hand in a
gesture of restraint

   i seek thurid the black dator i
said  my quarrel is with him not
with you let me pass then in peace
for if i mistake not he is as much our
enemy as mine and you can have no
cause to protect him

  they lowered their swords and la-
kor spoke

   i know not whom you may be
with the white skin of a thern and the
black hair of a red man but were it
only thurid whose safety were at
stake you might pass and welcome in
so far as we be concerned

   tell us who you be and what mis-
sion calls you to this unknown world
beneath the valley dor then maybe
we can see our way to let you pass
upon the errand which we should like
to undertake would our orders per-
mit

  i was surprised that neither of them
had recognized me for i thought that
i was quite sufficiently well known
either by personal experience or repu-
tation to every thern upon barsoom as
to make my identity immediately ap-
parent in any part of the planet in
fact i was the only white man upon
mars whose hair was black and whose
eyes were gray with the exception of
my son carthoris

  to reveal my identity might be to
precipitate an attack for every thern
upon barsoom knew that to me they
owed the fall of their age-old spiritual
supremacy on the other hand my
reputation as a fighting man might be
sufficient to pass me by these two were
their livers not of the right complex-
ion to welcome a battle to the death

  to be quite candid i did not attempt
warlord

of mars



to delude myself with any such sophis-
try since i knew well that upon war-
like mars there are few cowards and
that every man whether prince priest
or peasant glories in deadly strife
and so i gripped my long-sword the
tighter as i replied to lakor

   i believe that you will see the wis-
dom of permitting me to pass unmo-
lested i said  for it would avail you
nothing to die uselessly in the rocky
bowels of barsoom merely to protect
a hereditary enemy such as thurid
dator of the first born

   that you shall die should you
elect to oppose me is evidenced by the
moldering corpses of all the many
great barsoomian warriors who have
gone down beneath this blade-i am
john carter prince of helium

  for a moment that name seemed to
paralyze the two men but only for a
moment and then the younger of them
with a vile name upon his lips rushed
toward me with ready sword

  he had been standing a little behind
his companion lakor during our par-
ley and now ere he could engage me
the older man grasped his harness and
drew him back

   hold on  commanded lakor
 there will be plenty of time to fight
if we find it wise to fight at all there
be good reasons why every thern upon
barsoom should yearn to spill the blood
of the blasphemer the sacrilegist but
let us mix wisdom with our righteous
hate the prince of helium is bound
upon an errand which we ourselves
but a moment since were wishing that
we might undertake

   let him go then and slay the black
when he returns we shall still be here
to bar his way to the outer world and
thus we shall have rid ourselves of
two enemies nor have incurred the dis-
pleasure of the father of therns

  as he spoke i could not but note
the crafty glint in his evil eyes and
while i saw the apparent logic of his
reasoning i felt subconsciously per-
haps that his words did but veil some
sinister intent the other thern turned

toward- him in evident surprise but
when lakor had whispered a few brief
words into hi- ear he too drew back
and nodded acquiescence to his supe-
riors suggestion

   proceed john carter said
lakor but know that if thurid
does not lay you low there will be
those awaiting your return who will
see that you never pass again into the
sunlight of the upper world go

  during our conversation woola had
been growling and bristling close to
my side occasionally he would look
up into my face with a low pleading
whine as though begging for the word
that would send him headlong at the
bare throats before him he too
sensed the villainy behind the smooth
avords

  beyond the therns several doonvays
opened off the guard-room and toward
the one upon the extreme right lakor
motioned

   that avay leads to thurid he
said

  but avhen i avould haare called woola
to folloav me there the beast avhined
and held back and at last ran quickly
to the first opening at the left avhere
he stood emitting his coughing bark
as though urging me to folloav him
upon the right avav

  i turned a questioning look upon
lakor

   the brute is seldom avrong i said
 and avhile i do not doubt your supe-
rior knowledge thern i think that i
shall do avell to listen to the aroice of
instinct that is backed by love and loy-
alty

  as i spoke i smiled grimly that he
might know avithout words that i dis-
trusted him

   as you will the felloav replied
with a shrug  in the end it shall be
all the same

  i turned and folloaved woola into
the left-hand passage and though my
back avas toavard my enemies my ears
avere on the alert yet i heard no sound
of pursuit the passageway avas dim-
ly lighted by occasional radium bulbs


the all-story magazine

the universal lighting medium of bar-
soom

  these same lamps may have been
doing continuous duty in these subter-
ranean chambers for ages since they
require no attention and are so com-
pounded that they give off but the
minutest portion of their substance in
the generation of years of luminosity

o	j	

  we had proceeded for but a short
distance when we commenced to pass
the mouths of diverging corridors but
not once did woola hesitate it was
at the opening to one of these corri-
dors upon my right that i presently
heard a sound that spoke more plainly
to john carter fighting man than
could the words of my mother tongue
-it was the clank of metal-the metal
of a warriors harness - and it came
from a little distance up the corridor
upon my right

  woola heard it too and like a flash
he had wheeled and stood facing the
threatened danger his mane all abristle
and all his rows of glistening fangs
bared by snarling backdrawn lips
with a gesture i silenced him and to-
gether we drew aside into another
corridor a few paces farther on

  here we waited nor did we have
long to wait for presently we saw the
shadows of two men fall upon the
floor of the main corridor athwart the
doorway of our hiding - place very
cautiously they were moving now-
the accidental clank that had alarmed
me was not repeated

  presently they came opposite our
station nor was i surprised to see
that the two were lakor and his com-
panion of the guard-room

  they walked very softly and in the
right hand of each gleamed a keen
long-sword they halted quite close
to the entrance to our retreat whisper-
ing to one another

   can it be that we have distanced
them already said lakor

   either that or the beast has led
the man upon a wrong trail replied
the other  for the way which we took
is by far the shorter to this point--

                          

for him who knows it john carter
would have found it a short road to
death had he taken it as you suggested
to him

   yes said lakor  no amount of
fighting ability would have saved him
from the pivoted flagstone he surely
would have stepped upon it and by
now if the pit beneath it has a bottom
which thurid denies he should have
been rapidly approaching it curses on
that calot of his that warned him to-
ward the safer avenue  

   there be other dangers ahead of
him though spoke lakors fellow
 which he may not so easily escape--
should he succeed in escaping our two
good swords consider for example
what chance he will have coming un-
expectedly into the chamber of-

  i would have given much to have
heard the balance of that conversation
that i might have been warned of the
perils of the way that lay ahead but
fate intervened and just at the very in-
stant of all other instants that i would
not have elected to do it i sneezed

chapter iii

thu tumpuu of thu sun

  thuru was nothing for it now other
than to fight nor did i have any ad-
vantage as i sprang sword in hand
into the corridor before the two therns
for my untimely sneeze had warned
them of my presence and they were
ready for me

  there were no words for they
would have been a waste of breath
the very presence of the two pro-
claimed their treachery that they
were following to fall upon me un-
awares was all too plain and they of
course must have known that i under-
stood their plan

  in an instant i was engaged with
both and though i loathe the very
name of them i must in all fairness
admit that they are mighty swordsmen
and these two wje no exception un-
less it were that they were even more
warlord

of mars



skilled and fearless than the average
among their race

  while it lasted it was indeed as
joyous a conflict as i had ever expe-
rienced twice at least i saved my
breast from the mortal thrust of
piercing steel only by the wondrous
agility with which my earthly muscles
endow me under the conditions of
lesser gravity and air pressure upon
mars

  yet even so i came near to tasting
death that day in the gloomy corridor
beneath marss southern pole for
lakor played a trick upon me that in
all my experience of fighting upon two
planets i had never before witnessed
the like of

  the other thern was engaging me at
the time and i was forcing him back
-touching him here and there with
my point until he was bleeding from a
dozen wounds yet not being able to
penetrate his marvelous guard to reach
a vulnerable spot for the brief instant
that would have been sufficient to send
him to his ancestors

  it was then that lakor quickly un-
slung a belt from his harness and as
i stepped back to parry a wicked thrust
he lashed one end of it about my left
ankle so that it wound there for an
instant while he jerked suddenly upon
the other end throwing me heavily
upon my back

  then like leaping panthers they
were upon me but they had reckoned
without woola and before ever a blade
touched me a roaring embodiment of a
thousand demons hurtled above my
prostrate form and my loyal martian
calot was upon them

  imagine if you can a huge grizzly
with ten legs armed with mighty talons
and an enormous froglike mouth split-
ting his head form ear to ear ex-
posing three rows of long white tusks
then endow this creature of your im-
agination with the agility and ferocity
of a half-starved bengal tiger and the
strength of a span of bulls and you
will have some faint conception of
woola in action

  before i could call him off he had
crushed lakor into a jelly with a sin-
gle blow of one mighty paw and had
literally torn the other thern to rib-
bons  yet when i spoke to him sharply
he cowed sheepishly as though he had
done a thing to deserve censure and
chastisement

  never had i had the heart to punish
woola during the long years that had
passed since that first day upon mars
when the green jed of the tharks had
placed him on guard over me and i
had won his love and loyalty from the
cruel and loveless masters of his for-
mer life yet i believe that he would
have submitted to any cruelty that i
might have inflicted upon him so won-
drous was his affection for me

  the diadem in the center of the
circlet of gold upon the brow of lakor
proclaimed him a holy thern while
his companion not thus adorned was
a lesser thern though from his harness
i gleaned that he had reached the ninth
cycle which is but one below that of
the holy therns

  as i stood for a moment looking
at the gruesome havoc woola had
wrought there recurred to me the
memory of that other occasion upon
which i had masqueraded in the wig
diadem and harness of sator throg
the holy thern whom thuvia of
ptarth had slain and now it occurred
to me that it might prove of worth
to utilize lakors trappings for the
same purpose

  a moment later i had torn his yellow
wig from his bald pate and transferred
it and the circlet as well as all his
harness to my own person

  avoola did not approve of the meta-
morphosis he sniffed at me and
growled ominously but when i spoke
to him and patted his huge head he at
length became reconciled to the change
and at my command trotted off along
the corridor in the direction we had
been going when our progress had been
interrupted by the therns

  we moved cautiously now warned
by the fragment of conversation i had


the all-story magazine

overheard i kept abreast of woola
that we might have the benefit of all
our eyes for what might appear sud-
denly ahead to menace us and well it
was that we were forewarned

 at the bottom of a flight of narrow
steps the corridor turned sharply back
upon itself immediately making an-
other turn in the original direction so
that at that point it formed a perfect
letter s the top leg of which debouched
suddenly into a large chamber illy
lighted and the floor of which was
completely covered by venomous
snakes and loathsome reptiles

  to have attempted to cross that floor
would have been to court instant death
and for a moment i was almost com-
pletely discouraged then it occurred
to me that thurid and matai shang
with their party must have crossed it
and so there was a way

  had it not been for the fortunate
accident by which i overheard even so
small portion of the therns conver-
sation we should have blundered at
least a step or two into that wriggling
mass of destruction and a single step
would have been all sufficient to have
sealed our doom

  these were the only reptiles i had
ever seen upon barsoom but i knew
from their similarity to the fossilized
remains of supposedly extinct species
i had seen in the museums of helium
that they comprised many of the known
prehistoric reptilian genera as well as
others undiscovered

  a-more hideous aggregation of mon-
sters had never before assailed my vi-
sion it would be futile to attempt to
describe them to earth-men since sub-
stance is the only thing which they pos-
sess in common with any creature of the
past or present with which you are fa-
miliar-even their venom is of an un-
earthly virulence that by comparison
would make the cobra-di-capello seem
quite as harmless as an angleworm

  as they spied me there was a con-
certed rush by those nearest the en-
trance where we stood but a line of
radium bulbs inset along the threshold

of their chamber brought them to a
sudden halt-evidently they dared not
cross that line of light

   i had been quite sure that they would
not venture beyond the room in which
i had discovered them though i had
not guessed at what deterred them
the simple fact that we had found no
reptiles in the corridor through which
we had just come was sufficient assur-
ance that they did not venture there

  i drew woola out of harms way
and then began a careful survey of as
much of the chamber of reptiles as i
could see from where i stood as my
eyes became accustomed to the dim
light of its interior i gradually made
out a low gallery at the far end of the
apartment from which opened several
exits

   coming as close to the threshold as
i dared i followed this gallery with
my eyes discovering that it circled the
room as far as i could see then i
glanced above me along the upper edge
of the entrance to which we had come
and there to my delight i saw an end
of the gallery not a foot above my
head in an instant i had leaped to it
and called woola after me

  here there were no reptiles-the
way was clear to the opposite side of
the hideous chamber-and a moment
later woola and i dropped down to
safety in the corridor beyond

   not ten minutes later we came into
a vast circular apartment of white mar-
ble the walls of which were inlaid with
gold in the strange hieroglyphics of the
first born

  from the high dome of this mighty
apartment a huge circular column ex-
tended to the floor and as i watched i
saw that it slowly revolved

   i had reached the base of the temple
of the sun

  somewhere above me lay dejah
thoris and with her were phaidor
daughter of matai shang and thuvia
of ptarth but how to reach them
now that i had found the only vulner-
able spot in their mighty prison was
still a baffling riddle
warlord

of mars



  slowly i circled the great shaft
looking for a means of ingress part
way around i found a tiny radium
flash torch and as i examined it in mild
curiosity as to its presence there in this
almost inaccessible and unknown spot
i came suddenly upon the insignia of
the house of thurid jewel-inset in its
metal case

  i am upon the right trail i thought
as i slipped the bauble into the pocket-
pouch which hung from my harness
then i continued my search for-the
entrance which i knew must be some-
where about nor had i long to search
for almost immediately thereafter i
came upon a small door so cunningly
inlaid in the shafts base that it might
have passed unnoticed by a less keen or
careful observer

  there was the door that would lead
me within the prison but where was the
means to open it no button or lock
were visible again and again i went
carefully over every square inch of its
surface but the most that i could find
was a tiny pinhole a little above and
to the right of the doors center-a pin-
hole that seemed only an accident of
manufacture or an imperfection of
material

  into this minute aperture i attempted
to peer but whether it was but a frac-
tion of an inch deep or passed complete-
ly through the door i could not tell-
at least no light showed beyond it i
put my ear to it next and listened but
again my efforts brought negligible re-
sults

  during these experiments woola had
been standing at my side gazing intent-
ly at the door and as my glance fell
upon him it occurred to me to test the
correctness of my hypothesis that this
portal had been the means of ingress to
the temple used by thurid and matai
shang

  turning away abruptly i called to
him to follow me for a moment he
hesitated and then leaped after me
whining and tugging at my harness to
draw me back i walked on however
some distance from the door before i

 let him have his way that i might see
 precisely what he would do then i
 permitted him to lead me wherever he
 would

   straight back to that baffling portal
 he dragged me again taking up his po-
 sition facing the blank stone gazing
 straight at its shining surface for an
 hour i worked to solve the mystery of
 the combination that would open the
 way before me

   carefully i recalled every circum-
 stance of my pursuit of thurid and my
 conclusion was identical with my orig-
 inal belief-that thurid had come this
  way without other assistance than his
 own knowledge and passed through the
 door that barred my progress unaided
 from within but how had he accom-
 plished it

   i recalled the incident of the cham-
 ber of mystery in the golden cliffs that
 time i had freed thuvia of ptarth from
 the dungeon of the therns and she had
 taken a slender needlelike key from the
 key-ring of her dead jailer to open the
 door leading back into the chamber of
 mygtery where tars tarkas fought for
 his life with the great banths such a
 tiny keyhole as now defied me had
 opened the way to the intricate lock in
 that other door

   hastily i dumped the contents of my
 pocket-pouch upon the ground before-
 me could i but find a slender bit of
 steel i might yet fashion a key that
 would give me ingress to the temple
 prison

   as i examined the heterogeneous col-
 lection of odds and ends that is always
 to be found in the pocket-pouch of a
 martian warrior my hand fell upon the
 emblazoned radium flash torch of the
 black clator

   as i was about to lav the flash
 torch aside as of no value in my
 present predicament my eyes chanced
 upon a few characters roughly and
 freshly scratched upon the soft gold
 of the case

   casual curiosity prompted me to de-
 cipher them but what i read carried
 no immediate meaning to my mind


the aee-story magazine

there were three sets of characters
one below another

            h  t
            i  z

	i-  t

  for only an instant ray curiosity was
piqued and then i replaced the torch
in my pocket-pouch but my fingers had
not unclasped from about it when there
rushed from my memory the recollec-
tion of the conversation between lakor
and his companion when the lesser
thern had quoted the words of thurid
and scoffed at them  and what
think you of the ridiculous matter of
the light   let the light shine with
the intensity of three radium units for
fifty tals -ah there was the first line
of characters upon the torchs metal
case-- t  and for one zat let
it shine with the intensity of one ra-
dium unit -there wtas the second
line  and then for twenty-five tals
nine units

  the formula was complete but--
what did it mean

  i thought i knew and seizing a
powerful magnifying-glass from the
litter of my pocket-pouch i applied
myself to a careful examination of the
marble immediately about the pinhole
in the door i could have cried aloud in
exultation when my scrutiny disclosed
the almost invisible incrustation of par-
ticles of carbonized electrons which are
thrown off by these martian torches

  it was evident that for countless
ages radium torches had been applied
to this pinhole - and for what purpose
there could be but a single answer---
the mechanism of the lock was actu-
ated by light-rays and i john carter
prince of helium held the combination
in my hand-scratched by the hand of
my enemy upon his own torch-ease

  in a cylindrical bracelet of gold about
my wrist was my barsoomian chro-
nometer-a delicate instrument that
records the tals and zats and zodes of
martian time presenting them to view
beneath a strong crystal much after the
manner of an earthly odometer

  timing my operations carefully i
held the torch to the small aperture in
the door regulating the intensity of the
light by means of the thumb-lever upon
the side of the case

  for fifty tals i let three units of light
shine full into the pinhole then one
unit for one zat and for twenty-five
tals nine units those last twenty-five
tals were the longest twenty-five sec-
onds of my life would the lock click
at the end of those seemingly intermi-
nable intervals of time

  twenty-three twenty-four twen-
ty-five 

  i shut off the light with a snap for
seven tals i waited-there had been no
appreciable effect upon the locks
mechanism could it be that my theory
was entirely wrong

  hold had the nervous strain re-
sulted in a hallucination or did the door
really move slowly the solid stone
sank noiselessly back into the temple
wall-there was no hallucination here

  back and back it slid for ten feet
until it had disclosed at its right a nar-
row doorway leading into a dark and
narrow corridor that paralleled the
outer wall scarcely was the entrance
uncovered than woola and i had leaped
through-then the door slipped quietly
back into place

  down the corridor at some distance
i saw the faint reflection of a light
and toward this we made our way at
the point where the light shone was a
sharp turn and a little distance beyond
this a brilliantly lighted chamber

  plere we discovered a spiral stair-
way leading up from the center of the
circular room

  immediately i knew that we had
reached the center of the base of the
temple of the sun - the spiral run-
way led upward past the inner walls
of the prison cells somewhere above
me was dejah thoris unless thurid
and matai shang had already succeed-
ed in stealing her away

  we had scarcely started up the run-
way when woola suddenly displayed
the wildest excitement he leaped
warlord

of mars



back and forth snapping at my legs
and harness until i thought that he
was mad and finally when i pushed
him from me and started once more
to ascend he grasped my sword arm be-
tween his jaws and dragged me back

  no amount of scolding or cuffing
would suffice to make him release me
and i was entirely at the mercy of his
brute strength unless i cared to use
my dagger upon him with my left
hand but mad or no i had not the
heart to run the sharp blade into that
faithful body

  down into the chamber he dragged
me and across it to the side opposite
that at which we had entered here
was another doorway leading into a
corridor which ran directly down a
steep incline without a moments
hesitation woola jerked me along this
rocky passage

  presently he stopped and released
me standing between me and the way
we had come looking up into my face
as though to ask if i would now fol-
low him voluntarily or if he must still
resort to force

  looking ruefully at the marks of his
great teeth upon my bare arm i de-
cided to do as he seemed to wish me
to do after all his strange instinct
might be more dependable than my
faulty human judgment

  and well it was that  had been
forced to follow him but a short dis-
tance from the circular chamber we
came suddenly into a brilliantly light-
ed labyrinth of crystal glass partitioned
passages

  at first i thought it was one vast
unbroken chamber so clear and trans-
parent were the walls of the winding
corridors but after ii had nearly
brained myself a couple of times by
attempting to pass through solid vit-
reous wails i went more carefully

  we had proceeded but a few yards
along the corridor that had given us
entrance to this strange maze when
woola gave mouth to a most frightful
roar at the same time dashing against
the clear partition at our left

  the resounding echoes of that fear-
some cry were still reverberating
through the subterranean chambers
when i saw the thing that had startled
it from the faithful beast

  far in the distance dimly through
the many thicknesses of intervening
crystal as in a haze that made them
seem unreal and ghostly i discerned
the figures of eight people-three fe-
males and five men

  at the same instant evidently start-
led by woolas fierce cry they halted
and looked about then of a sudden
one of them a woman held her arms
out toward me and even at that great
distance i could see that her lips moved
--it was dejah thoris my ever beauti-
ful and ever youthful princess of he-
lium

  with her were thuvia of ptarth
phaidor daughter of in iatai shang
and thurid and the father of therns
and the three lesser therns that had ac-
companied them

  thurid shook his fist at me and then
two of the therns grasped dejah tho-
ris and thuvia roughly by their arms
and hurried them on a moment later
they had disappeared into a stone cor-
ridor beyond the labyrinth of glass

  they say that love is blind but so
great a love as that of dejah thoris
that knew me even beneath the thern
disguise i wore and across the misty
vista of that crystal maze must indeed
be far from blind

chapter iv

the secret tower

  i have no stomach to narrate the
monotonous events of the tedious days
that woola and i spent ferreting our
way across the labyrinth of glass
through the dark and devious ways be-
yond that led beneath the valley dor
and golden cliffs to emerge at last
upon the flank of the otz mountains
just above the valley of lost souls-
that pitiful purgatory peopled by the
poor unfortunates who dare not con-


the ale-story magazine

tinue their abandoned pilgrimage to
dor or return to the various lands of
the outer world from whence they
came

  elere thetrail of dejah thoriss ab-
ductors led along the mountains base
across steep and rugged ravines by the
side of appalling precipices and some-
times out into the valley where we
found fighting aplenty with the mem-
bers of the various tribes that make up
the population of this vale of hope-
lessness

  but through it all we came at last to
where the way led up a narrow gorge
that grew steeper and more impracti-
cable at every step until before us
loomed a mighty fortress buried be-
neath the side of an overhanging cliff

  here was the secret hiding-place of
matai shang father of therns here
surrounded by a handful of the faith-
ful the hekkador of the ancient faith
who had once been served by millions
of vassals and dependents dispensed
the spiritual word among the half
dozen nations of barsoom that still
clung tenaciously to their false and
discredited religion

  darkness was just falling as we
came in sight of the seemingly im-
pregnable walls of this mountain
stronghold and lest we be seen i drew
back with woola behind a jutting
granite promontory into a clump of
the hardv purple scrub that thrives
upon the barren sides of otz

  here we lay until the quick transi-
tion from daylight to darkness had
passed then i crept out to approach
the fortress walls in search of a way
within

  either through carelessness or over-
confidence in the supposed inaccessi-
bility of their hiding-place the triple-
barred gate stood ajar beyond were
a handful of guards laughing and
talking over one of their incompre-
hensible barsoomian games

  i saw that none of the guardsmen
had been of the party that accom-
panied thurid and matai shang and
so relying entirely upon my disguise

i walked boldly through the gateway
and up to the thern guard

  the men stopped their game and
looked up at me but there was no sur-
prise upon their faces and no sign of
suspicion similarly they looked at
woola growling at my heel

  kaor i said in true martian
greeting and the warriors arose and
saluted me  i have but just found
my way hither from the golden cliffs
i continued  and seek audience with
the hekkador matai shang father of
therns where may he be found 

   follow me said one of the guard
and turning led me across the outer
courtyard toward a second buttressed
wall

  why the apparent ease with which
i seemingly deceived them did not
rouse my suspicions i know not unless
it was that my mind was still so full
of that fleeting glimpse of my beloved
princess that there was room in it for
naught else be that as it may the
fact is that i marched buoyantly be-
hind my guide straight into the jaws
of death

  afterward i learned that thern spies
had been aware of my coming for
hours before i reached the hidden
fortress

  the gate had been purposely left
ajar to tempt me on the guards had
been schooled well in their part of the
conspiracy and i more like a school-
boy than a seasoned warrior ran head-
long into the trap

  at the far side of the outer court
a narrow door let into the angle made
by one of the buttresses with the wall
here my guide produced a key and
opened the way within then stepping
back he motioned me to enter

   matai shang is in the temple court
beyond he said and as woola and i
passed through the fellow closed the
door quickly upon us

  the nasty laugh that came to my
ears through the heavy planking of the
door after the lock clicked was my first
intimation that all was not as it
should be
warlord of mars



  i found myself in a small circular
chamber within the buttress before
me a door opened presumably upon
the inner court beyond for a moment
i hesitated all my suspicions now sud-
denly though tardily roused then
with a shrug of my shoulders i opened
the door and stepped out into the glare
of torches that lighted the inner court

  directly opposite me a massive tower
rose to a height of three hundred feet
it was of the strangely beautiful mod-
ern barsoomian style-of architecture
its entire surface hand-carved in bold
relief with intricate and fanciful de-
signs thirty feet above the courtyard
and overlooking it was a broad bal-
cony and there indeed was matai
shang and with him were thurid and
phaidor thuvia and dejah thoris-
the last two heavily ironed a hand-
ful of thern warriors stood just be-
hind the little party

  as i entered the enclosure the eyes
of those in the balcony were full upon
me

  an ugly smile distorted the cruel
lips of matai shang thurid hurled
a taunt at me and placed a familar hand
upon the shoulder of my princess like
a tigress she turned upon him striking
the beast a heavy blow with the man-
acles upon her wrist

  he would have struck back had not
matai shang interfered and then i saw
that the two men were not over friend-
ly for the manner of the thern was
arrogant and domineering as he made
it plain to the first born that the prin-
cess of helium was the personal prop-
erty of the father of therns and
thurids bearing toward the ancient
hekkador savored not at all of liking
or respect

  when the altercation in the balcony
had subsided matai shang turned
again to me

   earthman he cried  you have
earned a more ignoble death than now
lies within our weakened power to in-
flict upon you but that the death you
die to-night may be doubly bitter know
you that when you have passed your

    	s

widow becomes the wife of matai
shang hekkador of the ploly therns
for a martian year

   at the end of that time as you
know she shall be discarded as is the
law among us but not as is usual to
lead a quiet and honored life as high
priestess of some hallowed shrine in-
stead dejah thoris princess of he-
lium shall become the plaything of my
lieutenants-perhaps of thy most hated
enemy thurid the black dator

  as he ceased speaking lie awaited in
silence evidently for some outbreak of
rage upon my part - something that
would have added to the spice of his
revenge but i did not give him the
satisfaction that he craved

  instead i did the one thing of all
others that might rouse his anger and
increase his hatred of me for i knew
that if i died derail thoris too would
find a way to die before they could
heap further indignities upon her

  of all the holy of holies which the
thern venerates and worships none is
more revered than the jellow wig
which covers his bald pate and next
thereto comes the circlet of gold and
the great diadem whose scintillant
rays mark the attainment of the tenth
cycle

  and knowing this i removed the
wig and circlet from my head tossing
them carelessly upon the flagging of
the court then i wiped my feet upon
the yellow tresses and as a groan of
rage arose from the balcony i spat full
upon the holy diadem

  matai shang went livid with anger
but upon the lips of thurid i could see
a grim smile of amusement for to him
these things were not holy so lest he
should derive too much amusement
from my act i cried  and thus did i
with the holies of issus goddess of
life eternal ere i threw issus herself
to the mob that once had worshiped
her to be torn to pieces in her own
temple

  that put an end to thurids grin-
ning for he had been high in the favor
of issus


the all-story magazine

   let us have an end to this blas-
pheming he cried turning to the
father of therns

  matai shang rose and leaning over
the edge of the balcony gave voice to
the weird call that  had heard from
the lips of the priests upon the tiny
balcony upon the face of the golden
cliffs overlooking the valley dor
when in times past they called the
fearsome white apes and the hideous
plantmen to the feast of victims float-
ing down the broad bosom of the mys-
terious iss toward the silian-infested
waters of the lost sea of korus

   let loose the death  he cried and
immediately a dozen doors in the base
of the tower swung open and a dozen
grim and terrible banths sprang into
the arena

  this was not the first time that i had
faced the ferocious barsoomian lion
but never had i been pitted single-
handed against a full dozen of them
even with the assistance of the fierce
woola there could be but a single out-
come to so unequal a struggle

  for a moment the beasts hesitated
beneath the brilliant glare of the
torches but presently their eyes be-
coming accustomed to the light fell
upon woola and me and with bristling
manes and deep - throated roars they
advanced lashing their tawny sides
with their powerful tails

  in the brief interval of life that was
left me i shot a last parting glance to-
ward my dejah thoris her beautiful
face was set in an expression of horror
and as my eyes met hers she extended
both arms toward me as struggling
with the guards who now held her she
endeavored to cast herself from the
balcony into the pit beneath that she
might share my death with me then
as the banths were about to close upon
me she turned and buried her dear face
in her arms

  suddenly my attention was drawn
toward thuvia of ptarth the beau-
tiful girl was leaning far over the edge
of the balcony her eyes bright with
excitement

  in another instant the banths would
be upon me but i could not force my
gaze from the features of the red girl
for i knew that her expression meant
anything but the enjoyment of the grim
tragedy that would so soon be enacted
below her there was some deeper hid-
den meaning which i sought to solve

  for an instant i thought of relying
on my earthly muscles and agility to
escape the banths and reach the bal-
cony which i could easily have done
but i could not bring myself to desert
the faithful woola and leave him to
die alone beneath the cruel fangs of
the hungry banths that is not the way
upon barsoom nor was it ever the way
of john carter

  then the secret of thuvias excite-
ment became apparent as from her lips
there issued the purring sound i had
heard once before that time that with-
in the golden cliffs she called the
fierce banths about her and led them
as a shepherdess might lead her flock
of meek and harmless sheep

  at the first note of that soothing
sound the banths halted in their tracks
and every fierce head went high as the
beasts sought the origin of the familiar
call presently they discovered the red
girl in the balcony above them and
turning roared out their recognition
and their greeting

  guards sprang to drag thuvia away
but ere they had succeeded she had
hurled a volley of commands at the
listening brutes and as one they turned
and marched back into their dens

   you need not fear them now john
carter cried thuvia before they
could silence her  those banths will
never harm you now nor woola
either

  it was all i cared to know there
was naught to keep me from that bal-
cony now and with a long running-
leap i sprang far aloft until my hands
grasped its lowest sill

  in an instant all was wild confusion
matai shang shrank back thurid
sprang forward with drawn sword to
cut me down
warlord

of mars



  again dejah thor is wielded her
heavy irons and fought him back
then matai shang grasped her about
the waist and dragged her away
through a door leading within the
tower

  for an instant thurid hesitated and
then as though fearing that the father
of therns would escape him with the
princess of helium he too dashed
from the balcony in their wake

  phaidor alone retained her presence
of mind two of the guards she or-
dered to bear away thuvia of ptarth
the others she commanded to remain
and prevent me from following then
she turned toward me

   john carter she cried  for the
last time i offer you the love of
phaidor daughter of the holy hek-
kador accept and your princess shall
be returned to the court of her grand-
father and you shall live in peace and
happiness refuse and the fate that
my father has threatened shall fall upon
dejah thoris

   you cannot save her now for by
this time they have reached a place
where even you may not follow re-
fuse and naught can save you for
though the way to the last stronghold
of the holy therns was made easy for
you the way hence hath been made im-
possible what say you  

   you knew my answer phaidor
i replied  before ever you spoke
make way i cried to the guards  for
john carter prince of helium would
pass 

  with that i leaped over the low bal-
uster that surrounded the balcony and
with drawn long-sword faced my
enemies

  there avere three of them but
phaidor must have guessed avhat the
outcome of the battle avould be for
she turned and fled from the balcony
the moment she saav that i would have
none of her proposition

  the three guardsmen did not wait for
my attack instead they rushed me--
the three of them simultaneously and
it avas that avhich gave me an advan-

tage for they fouled one another in
the narroav precincts of the balcony so
that the foremost of them stumbled
full upon my blade at the first on-
slaught

  the red stain upon my point roused
to its full the old hlood-lust of the
fighting man that has earer been so
strong avithin my breast so that my
blade flew through the air avith a savift-
ness and deadly accuracy that threav
the tavo remaining therns into avild
despair

  when at last the sharp steel found
the heart of one of them the other
turned to flee and guessing that his
steps avould lead him along the avay
taken by those  sought i let him keep
ever far enough ahead to think that
he avas safely escaping my savord

  through several inner chambers he
raced until he came to a spiral runway
up this he dashed i in close pursuit
at the upper end ave came out into a
small chamber the avails of avhich
avere blank except for a single avindow
overlooking the slopes of otz and the
valley of lost souls beyond

  here the felloav tore franticall at
avhat appeared to be but a piece of the
blank avail oposite the single avindow
in an instant i guessed that it avas a
secret exit from the room and so i
paused that he might have an oppor-
tunity to negotiate it for i cared noth-
ing to take the life of this poor seraritor
-all i craved avas a clear road in pur-
suit of dejeh thoris

  but try as he avould the panel
avould yield neither to cunning nor
force so that eaentually he gaare it up
and turned to face me

   go thy avay thern i said to him
pointing toward the entrance to the run-
avay up avhich ave had but just come
 i have no quarrel avith you nor do
i craae your life go

  for answer he sprang upon me with
his savord and so suddenly at that that
i avas like to haae gone doavn before his
first rush so there avas nothing for
it but to give him what he sought and
that as quickly as might be that i

might not be delayed too long in this
chamber while matai shang and thu-
rid made way with dejah thoris and
thuvia of ptarth

  the fellow was a clever swordsman
-resourceful and extremely tricky in
fact he seemed never to have heard
that there existed such a thing as a
code of honor for he repeatedly out-
raged a dozen barsoomian fighting
customs that an honorable man would
rather die than ignore

  he even went so far as to snatch his
holy wig from his head and throw it
in my face so as to blind me for a
moment while he thrust at my unpro-
tected breast

  when he thrust however i was not
there for i had fought with therns
before and while none had ever re-
sorted to precisely that same expedient
i knew them to lie the least honorable
and most treacherous fighters upon
mars and so was ever on the alert for
some new and devilish subterfuge when
i was engaged with one of their race

  but at length he overdid the thing
for drawing his short sword he hurled
it javelinwise at my body at the same
instant rushing upon me with his long
sword a single sweeping circle of
my own blade caught the flying weapon
and hurled it clattering against the far
wall and then as i side-stepped my
antagonists impetuous rush i let him
have my point full in the stomach as
he hurtled by

  clear to the hilt my weapon passed
through his body and with a fright-
ful shriek he sank to the floor dead

  halting only for the brief instant
that was required to wrench my sword
from the carcass of my late antagonist
i sprang across the chamber to the blank
wall beyond through which the thern
hail attempted to pass here i sought
for the secret of its lock but all to no
avail

  in despair i tried to force the thing
but the cold unyielding stone might
well have laughed at my futile puny
endeavors in fact i could have
sworn that i caught the faint sugges-

tion of taunting laughter from beyond
the baffling panel

  in disgust i desisted from my use-
less efforts and stepped to the cham-
bers single window

  the slopes of otz and the distant
valley of lost souls held nothing to
compel my interest then but tower-
ing far above me the towers carved
wall riveted my keenest attention

  somewhere within that massive pile
was dejah thoris above me i could
see windows there possibly lay the
only way by which i could reach her
the risk was great but not too great
when the fate of a worlds most won-
drous woman was at stake

  i glanced below a hundred feet
beneath lay jagged granite boulders at
the brink of a frightful chasm upon
which the tower abutted and if not
upon the boulders then at the chasms
bottom lay death should a foot slip
but once or clutching fingers lose their
hold for the fraction of an instant

  but there was no other way and with
a shrug which i must admit was half
shudder i stepped to the windows
outer sill and began my perilous ascent
aloft

  to my dismay i found that unlike
the ornamentation upon most helium-
atic structures the edges of the carv-
ings were quite generally rounded so
that at best my every hold was most
precarious

  fifty feet above me commenced a
series of projecting cylindrical stones
some six inches in diameter these
apparently circled the tower at six-foot
intervals in bands six feet apart and
as each stone cylinder protruded some
four or five inches beyond the surface
of the other ornamentation they pre-
sented a comparatively easy mode of
ascent could i but reach them

  laboriously i climbed toward them
by way of some windows which lay
below them for i hoped that i might
find ingress to the tower through one
of these and thence an easier avenue
along which to prosecute my search

  at times so slight was my hold upon
warlord of mars



the rounded surfaces of the carvings
edges that a sneeze a cough or even a
slight gust of wind would have dis-
lodged me and sent me hurtling to the
depths below

  but finally i reached a point where
my fingers could just clutch the sill of
the lowest window and i was on the
point of breathing a sigh of relief when
the sound of voices came to me from
above through the open window

   he can never solve the secret of
that lock the voice was matai
shangs  let us proceed to the han-
gar above that we may be far to the
south before he finds another way-
should that be possible

   all things seem possible to that
vile calot replied another voice which
i recognized as thurids

   then let us haste said matai
shang  but to be doubly sure i will
leave two who shall patrol this run-
way later they may follow us upon
another flier-overtaking us at kaol

  my upstretched fingers never reached
the windows sill at the first sound
of the voices i drew back my hand and
clung there to my perilous perch flat-
tened against the perpendicular wall
scarce daring to breathe

  what a horrible position indeed in
which to be discovered by thurid he
had but to lean from the window to
push me with his swords point into
eternity

  presently the sound of the voices
became fainter and once again i took
up my hazardous ascent but now it
was more difficult since more circui-
tous for i must climb so as to avoid
the windows

  matai shangs reference to the han-
gar and the fliers indicated that my

destination lay nothing short of the
roof of the tower and toward this
seemingly distant goal i set my face

  the most difficult part of the journey
was accomplished and it was with re-
lief that i felt my fingers close about
the lowest of the stone cylinders

  it is true that these projections were
too far apart to make the balance of
the ascent anything of a sinecure but
i at least had always within my reach
a point of safety to which  might cling
in case of accident

  some ten feet below the roof the-
wall inclined slightly inward possibly
a foot in the last ten feet and here the
climbing was immeasurably easier so
that my fingers soon clutched the eaves

  as i drew my eyes above the level
of the towers top i saw a flier all but
ready to rise

  upon her deck was matai shang
phaidor dejah thoris thuvia of
ptarth and a few thern warriors
while beside her stood thurid in the act
of clambering aboard

 he was not ten paces from me
facing in the opposite direction and
what cruel freak of fate should have
caused him to turn about just as my
eyes topped the roofs edge i may not
even guess

  but turn he did and when his eyes
met mine his wicked face lighted with
a malignant smile as lie leaped toward
me where i was hastening to scramble
to the secure footing of the roof

  dejah thoris must have seen me at
the same instant for she screamed a
useless warning just as thurids foot
swinging in a mighty kick landed full
in my face

  like a felled ox i reeled and tum-
bled backward over the towers side

acting off-stage

the man with the gray eyes stared
our glances met then instantly
he looked away and became ab-
sorbed in studying the frescos round
the ceiling i sought to locate the girl
i had tricked

  she was walking aimlessly to the
center of the room  and a few feet away
stood the individual who had been sent
by kronholtz to receive the ring star-
ing directly at me with a perplexed
frown on his hang-dog features he
too had seen me recover the handker-
chief evidently notedmy red carna-
tion and my glance into my palm

  quickly he strode to the womans
side doffed his hat and began speaking
to her excitedly nodding his head re-
peatedly in my direction she turned
with a bewildered expression on her
dark features and surveyed me

  if my wish had not been working up
to concert pitch at that very instant
this story would never have been writ-
ten-for the plan i then and there de-
cided upon like a lightning-flash proved
to be the pivot upon which all that fol-
lows turned

  i had the ring but i needed more
than that i wanted the riddle of the
ring the girl probably knew i would
speak to her a scheme unfolded to
me as smoothly as if i had rehearsed

like

  one glance i gave at the man oppo-
site with the eyes of a hawk he was
still apparently absorbed in the fres-
coes around the ceiling i would have
to chance it with him

  evidently he was after the ring too
but it -was very apparent that he was
not playing the game with the girl and
ivronholtzs emissary so placing the
ring in my waistcoat-pocket i started
forward into the writing-room walking
a little irregularly as a gentleman will
who has imbibed somewhat freely

  my eyes were half shut a vacuous
smile adorned my face i thankedmy
stars i was an actor

  i approached the perturbed couple
who realized that the wrong man had
obtained the much-sought ring

   pardon me madam i addressed
the woman with my hat in my hand

  they both eyed me curiously show-
ing plainly their perturbation

   you dropped your handkchief by
the door an i picked it up an you
dropped-hie-a ring in m hand yes
-dropped ring in m hand whatcher

   oh sir i just missed it she smiled
up into my face winningly and when
she smiled any inebriated gentleman
would have given her his bank-roll but
i didnt happen to be drunk

  you see it musthave fallen from
my finger she continued  it is rath-
er large and when i took the handker-
chief from you it fell into your hand
thank you ever so much for returning
it

  she held out her hand as if there
was no question about my turning over
the ornament she was some actress
herself

at her reprovingly in answer to the in-
dignant expression that shot from her
eyes they were wonderful eyes in-
deed-smoldering fires burning beneath
them which seemed to change their col-
or and expression with every emotion
of their owner

hie-an i have beauful red carnashun

i may be drunk-hie-slighly under
infiunee y know-but im wise-hie
-betcherlife im wise 

  i smiled fatuously into her eyes again
shaking a reproving finger

  sir she exclaimed simulating
splendidly righteous indignation that
is my husbands ring and i demand
that you return it or i shall have an 
officer summoned

   oh no y wont-no y wont
youre in bad-y know yr in bad-
hie-an i know too i argued with
the unreasoning stubbornness which
liquor produces

   tell yer what i continued  if
youll send this-hie-gemman for yr
husban an he can dentify ring welln
good if not-hie-welln gopd also

  i waved my hand as if fate itself had
decreed

  standing a few steps in back of the
woman was the man with the search-
light eyes staring absorbedly up at the
frescoes round the ceiling but i no-
ticed his ears-enormous lobes which
seemed to be glued flat against the sides
of his head-and i knew that they
heard every word i uttered

  i purposely spoke loud enough for
him to hear for i would have to deal
with him sooner or later and i would
give him something to guess about in
the interim i had already acquired an
enormous respect for him there was


the all-story magazine

something about the man that told me
he was  infant with whom to match
wits

  meanwhile the strange eyes of the
girl were studying me changing ex-
pression with every thought of her agile
brain at last she came to a decision

  very well she returned quietly
 and will you give my husband the
ring if he identifies it 

   suredly-hie-s suredly  i
affirmed  im gemman of  word
i am send this gemman for y hus-
ban-hie-an well wait here f him
 all right she agreed  pardon
me a moment

  she stepped aside and spoke in a low
rapid tone to the fellow with the hang-
dog countenance who had stood beside
her throughout the interview glowering
at me with his watery pale-blue little
eyes he looked as if he would have
taken extreme delight in strangling me

  and i caught these words here and
there  kronholtz - quickly - back
here-hold him-the drunken fool 
she returned in a moment smiling
very sweetly

   very well sir this gentleman will
have my husband here in about half an
hour shall we wait here  

   suredly-hie--wait here wizzu-
f course

  she led the way to a writing-desk and
seated herself i drew another chair
alongside and sat down somewhat un-
steadily i had accomplished something
by getting rid of kronholtzs man

  now to get some information if pos-
sible from this very clever young lady

  even while i rested my elbow on the
desk the man with the expressionless
face and piercing gray eyes had saun-
tered over aimlessly stationed himself
three feet away and again resumed his
absorbed contemplation of the ceiling

  i chuckled to myself

   ill give you a run for your money
i thought and then addressed myself
to the girl before me who was striving
hard to conceal her irritation at what
she supposed my drunken meddling

   sorry t trouble a lady-hie-but

im married self i began  got
three chilren-beauful wife i believe
in p-preservin san-sanctity of the home
an you-married lady-meet man-
hie-strange man-wizzer ring-poor
husbans ring looks bad-hie---
v-very bad

  her long slender fingers resting on
the desk before her seemed to be itch-
ing to tear my hair avhile those ex-
traordinary eyes smoldered with sup-
pressed fury but she evidently had
come to the conclusion that the best
plan was to humor me and endeavor to
exercise her charms to overcome my
suspicions

   oh sir you do me a terrible in-
justice she exclaimed her voice
trembling her eyes now pathetic and
beseeching  you are a gentleman i
can see therefore you will reserve
your suspicions until they are proved
and not cast aspersions  my good
name

   when my husband arrives he will
explain everything to your entire sat-
isfaction

  yes the stage certainly lost an ac-
complished artist when this girl turned
adventuress

  i wondered just how it could be ex-
plained  and even while she spoke my
eyes fell upon a gold mesh hand-bag
which she had placed on the edge of
the desk beside my elbow and
through the open chainwork i descried
two keys-evidently the keys to apart-
ment no  again my wits served
me right royally

   mdear madam i began apolo-
getically  i-hie-beg yumble-hie
-qpardon for-

  and just then my unsteady elbow
slipped and knocked the gold mesh-
bag to the floor at my feet i stooped
to recover it deftly opened the catch
palmed the two keys and closed the
bag again before my wabbly hand re-
placed it on the table

  she could not see the manipulation
for the top of the desk obstructed her
range of vision but some one else
saw
the house of sorcery



  as i raised my head from the floor
two gray eyes were boring down watch-
ing every movement of my filching
fingers but as i replaced the bag on
the desk those search-light eyes in their
expressionless frame were again glued
ceilingward

   i beg yumble pardon i continued
my interrupted apology  didnt mean
t hurt y feelings ill rserve-hie-
my decishun till husban arrives-so i
will will y exuse me minute got
t telphone-hie-m wife wont be
home fr n hour

   certainly she conceded smiling
graciously very well pleased with the
favorable impression she was apparent-
ly making

  i zigzagged over to two telephone
booths alongside the door they con-
tained slot machines and thus required
no operator for which i was thankful
i entered one and closed the sliding
glass door behind me

  the man with the face of a mummy
and a hobby for studying interior dec-
orations was sauntering into the adjoin-
ing booth

   sound proof-these booths i
chuckled to myself  mr gimlet-
eyes will be fooled

  i dropped a nickel in the slot and
called the number the occupant of apart-
ment no  had given me some half
hour or so ago and when the german
accent voiced its  hello i answered
imitating the girls voice to a nicety

  i had been studying its every inflec-
tion while she spoke to me that had
been my specialty in the st louis stock
company - impersonations and it
stood me in good stead at this very
moment

   hello i responded in the girls
rich musical tones  do you know who
is speaking 

   yah he returned at once  vat
iss der matter didnt my man ar-
rive  

   yes i replied then i told him
in a few rapid words just what had
happened

  he swore very fluently considering

  that the english language handicapped
him and utterly regardless of the fact
that a  lady  was on the other end
of the wire i interrupted his flow of
brimstone

   listen to me  i called sharply
 it is all right now after i sent your
man to fetch you i succeeded in whee-
dling this drunken fool into giving me
the ring

   ach  himmel youre a peach-
von big peach  he shouted over the
wire

   as soon as your man arrives i
continued  send him at once to the
lobby of the garford hotel on broad-
way ill meet him there in about half
an hour-as soon as i can get rid of
this drunken fool-and give him the
ring

   goot flere he iss now

   all right-good-by

  highly pleased with my successful
effort at imitating the girls voice i
dropped another nickel in the slot

   now to fool her own brother i
told myself and gave the number of
the apartment-house where he resided
which i had noted carefully while sit-
ting at the switchboard a good mem-
ory is a handy thing in cases like this

  in a moment my colored friend was
connecting me with apartment no 

   hello the girls voice greeted her
brother  im talking to you from the
willington

  i shivered in my boots for fear he
would detect the impersonation but
no

   yes-did you pass the ring along
all right 

   no i replied and told him briefly
what had transpired

  not being handicapped like kron-
holtz he swore rapidly and volubly
with great picturesqueness

   listen to me i interrupted  i
have persuaded this drunken fool to go
with me to the flotel saint claire you
are supposed to be my husband and
are stopping there-understand

   he says he will give up the ring
if you can describe it so it is not so


the all-story magazine

  bad after all i will meet you in the
lobby of the saint claire in half an
hour be sure to be there

   you bet i will good-by
immensely pleased i dropped an-
other nickel in the slot and called max
leidners number as luck would have
it doris herself answered

   hello this is cliff ellis

   yes whats the matter   came her
wondering question

   cant explain now i want you to
do something call up mr king at
number double - o - three madison
square that is the number of the
hotel willington where i am now i
am mr king understand tell the
operator to have me paged in the wri-
ting-room telephone immediately

   yes came her quick response
 good-by

   good-by i said and again walked
unsteadily across the room and rejoined
the girl who was sitting patiently where
i left her as i took my seat beside
her at the desk the man with the gimlet
eyes had already emerged from the
other telephone booth and was saunter-
ing casually toward us

   mwife avas out - hie - visitin
frien i informed the girl with the
changeable eyes  so i talked wiz
daughter-beauful little g-girl-hie--
nfdaughter is betcherlife her muz-
zers goin call me soons she- 
mr king-mr king cried a
young man in uniform paging through
the avriting-room

   there she is noav i said  holy
smoke if m avife saav me sittin here
avizzu-good night very j-jealous
woman-m avife i smiled stupidly at
my companion  xcuse me once more
-hie-please be back in minute
she bowed a smiling acquiescence as
 rose and folloaved the boy as i
turned into the lobby i could see the
man avith the expressionless face stand-
ing near the girl at the desk staring up
steadfastly at the ceiling

   he figures its best to watch her
i reflected  very good it would
have been a hard job to lose him

  i took the call in a booth avhich one
of the operators at the savitchboard in-
dicated

  hello doris i said youve
done well thats all i wanted-to be
called so i could get aavay from a cer-
tain party will explain later see
you as soon as i can ive got the ring
good-by

  without losing any time i hurried
across the lobby and out on broadway
very-well pleased with my impromptu
performance

   noav for a little investigation i
mused avending my avay back toward
the house from which doris armont
no  had emerged

  i had the girls keys to apartment
no  and i might find papers there
which would throav some light on this
baffling riddle of the ring her brother
avould have left by this time to meet
his sister at the saint claire and thus
the apartment avould be open for my
inspection kronholtzs man avould be
on his avay to the garford hotel he
would get tired waiting for the girl
after an hour and return to report
to his employer then  kronholtz
would telephone apartment no  to
find nobody there and then rush to the
willington to try and trace the girl

  after her brother became tired of
avaiting at the saint claire the probabil-
ities were that he would go to the wil-
lington also meanwhile the girl
avould become uneasy at my non-ap-
pearance but i counted on her deciding
to avait there trusting that i avould
eventually return

  she avould be afraid to leave the
avriting-room and thus lose all chance
of recovering the ring i ought to haae
a clear road in my investigation for the
next hour at least

  gee wont they be mad avhen
they all meet in the willington and
compare notes i chuckled won-
der hoav in blazes mr gimletteyes be-
came mixed up-

   good evening mr ellis
somebody had tapped me gently on
the shoulder
the house

of sorcery



  annoyed at being recognized and
possibly interrupted in my mission i
turned and there was mr gimlet-eyes
no longer with a face like a stone image
but smiling blandly up into my face 

chapter vih

apartment no 

  i coued only stare at him wonder-
ing stupidly how he knew my name

   you worked that pretty slick-yes
very slick he confided still smiling
genially  you are a good actor-on
and off the stage rather out of your
line though isnt it  

  sir i exclaimed angrily know-
ing not what to say

  i could have knocked him down so
mad was i at this unexpected stumbling-
block to my little scheme

   tut tut  he remonstrated taking
my arm like a good fellow will and
starting along broadway with me
 dont lets lose precious time standing
here we must get back to apartment
no  and see what there is to see

  i nearly dropped to the sidewalk
how the devil did he know i was bound
for apartment no  he noted my
surprise with a little smile across his
wide mouth which almost severed his
face in half

   come on he urged walking
ahead  well talk as we walk

  there was nothing else to do i cer-
tainly couldnt lose him just now

   what makes you think im bound
for this place you mention i asked
staring at him as we hurried along

   didnt you pinch the young ladys
keys he parried with another ques-
tion and a confiding smile

  it was wonderful what a transfor-
mation came over that mummy face
when its owner talked and smiled it
was now the most keenly intelligent
face i had ever observed

   what business is it of yours- i
began my anger rising rapidly

   as much my business as yours he
interrupted genially  please dont

lets argue time is precious well
have about an hour to search her
brother will leave the apartment and
wait for her at the saint claire

   kronholtzs man will be waiting
at the garford hotel and when they
all take a tumble and meet the girl at
the willington therell be some fire-
works believe me 

  i stopped short in the middle of the
hurrying swirl of people on the crowd-
ed avenue and stared with mouth agape
at this astonishing creature beside me
how in the name of sorcery did he
know all this then i voiced my con-
viction in stammering words

  are-are you-a mind-reader  

   no-only a good listener

   but i was in a sound-proof tele-
phone booth  i ejaculated

   see these ears   he pointed a
stubby finger to his nearest ear-one
of those immense organs which seemed
glued to the side of his head

  it was different from any human
ear i had ever seen it was remark-
ably thin-almost transparent near the
edges and the orifice was exceedingly
large curving back into the head with a
long sweep which gave his whole ear
the general appearance of the horn of
a talking-machine

   i have the best hearing of any man
on earth he continued easily  i
could almost have heard every word of
your impersonating voice if i had stood
outside on the floor of the writing-
r 

   by gad i believe you could  i
admitted staring admiringly at that
extraordinary appendage

  again he had my arm and was hur-
rying me swiftly along we turned a
corner and started east  the street
where doris armont no  lived

   and i suppose you heard every
word i said to the girl i conceded
utterly upset

   you bet i did jimmy-it was
rich  he chuckled gleefully  ive
always prided myself on being quick-
witted but im a humble disciple of
yours after this


the all-story magazine

   you seem to think that im going
to cultivate your acquaintance from
now on i voiced sarcastically
 youre very much mistaken im
going to side-track you at the first op-
portunity

  his immense mouth opened in a
cheerful grin

   youre not dealing with a woman
now he informed graciously  be-
sides you and i have interests in com-
mon we cant afford to quarrel-at
least not until after we have ransacked
apartment no 

  i did some rapid thinking maybe
he was right he was playing against
this girl and her brother just like my-
self he was certainly resourceful
and our combined wits ought to work
avell together-for a tim i suddenly
thought that he might know the riddle
of the ring

   youre right i conceded amiably
 its a bargain what do you know
about this ring 

   what do you know   he retorted
   i asked you first

   i know a avhole lot-but i avont
tell you just now we can discuss that
later we have avork ahead

   whats your plan  i asked men-
tally vowing that i avould not now lose
sight of him for a good deal

  he knew the riddle of the ring
good-and id knoav it soon if i had
to choke it out of him but i realized
it avould be quite a choking operation
for though much below the average
in height he aras as aviry as an eel and
as stocky as a young bull besides he
avas no fool

   my plan is simple he informed
 ill take the keys and go into apart-
ment no  the avindows face on an
empty lot on the east side you sta-
tion yourself on the sidewalk in ariew
of these avindows ill throw one open
avhen i enter if you see the girl or
her brother- by the avay do you
knoav her brother by sight  

   yes

   good if either of them returns
before i finish my investigation you

 whistle and ill come out into the hall
 and down the stairs

    yery nice  responded dryly
  and you get all the information--
 and keep it

    you can go into the apartment
 then he answered readily  and ill
 keep avatch on the sideavalk the only
 reason i suggested my going in was
 that  have a pretty good idea where
 and for what to search if you have
 also avhy go ahead im satisfied
 either avay-so long as we get the in-
 formation

   he avas evidently perfectly frank in
 the matter and i didnt knoav where
 and for what to search

    no-you search i conceded

    and if either of them returns be-
 fore im through he avent on  you
 avhistle and thenfolloav up the stairs
 and ill meet you there and avell try
 something else i have in mind

    very well i agreed as we came
 near the house i handed him the two
 keys i had taken from the girls mesh
 bag

   arrived at the door i saav that the
 young negro avas up through the build-
 ing somewhere with the elevator

    nows your chance before the
 elevator - boy comes doavn i said
  good luck  

he shot into the corridor and up the
stairway like a monkey i walked to
 the east end of the buliding in front of
the aacant lot avhere i could scan the
windows

    in a minute a light shone in the front
 apartment on the second floor and a
 moment later my new acquaintances
 chunky form appeared at a window
 he threw up the sash lowered the cur-
 tain half-way avaved his hand at me
 and disappeared to commence his
 search

    paced quietly up and doavn keep-
 ing a avatchful eye for the return of
 the girl or her brother

   i tried to figure out just avhat in-
 terest this astounding stranger had in
 the affair it avas beyond me-like a
 good many other remarkable things
the house of sorcery



which had transpired in this remark-
able day

  i had developed an enormous respect
for the possessor of the wireless-tele-
graph ears in my short acquaintance-
also an unaccountable liking he was
a man after my own heart and his
astonishingly shrewd gray eyes had a
very frank expression for one engaged
in such shady proceedings

  a half-hour passed it seemed like
two hours to me i was growing mo-
mentarily very nervous ever and
anon the quick-moving shadow of my
companion in crime was thrown against
one of the lighted windows as he
searched through the apartment

  evidently his efforts were proving
unavailing

  then crossing madison avenue and
coming down the street with quick
steps i descried the figure of the girls
brother whom i had followed from
max leidners home i whistled
sharply

  immediately the lights were extin-
guished in apartment no  and i
shot through the doorway and into
the corridor the elevator had just
ascended with a lady who preceded me
a few seconds before i sprang up the
stairway and met my companion 
the first landing coming down

   armont is returning i said in a
hurried whisper  what luck 

   couldnt find a thing listen now
to my plan as soon as he enters his
apartment well knock on the door by
the way does he know you by sight 

   not to my knowledge

   well chance it then ill inform
him that we are central-office men in
search of a man who was seen by a
passer-by on the street climbing down
the fire-escape of this house from the
roof as we noticed a window of his
apartment open we think he entered
there and is in hiding

   if he thinks-as he probably will
-that it has some connection with
this matter of the ring he will in all
probability rush at once for the place
where he secretes the documents i-

we are looking for that will give you
your cue to steer him into another part
of the apartment and ill secure the
evidence are you on  

   yes

  by this time armont on the floor
below was pressing the electric button
to summon the elevator just then it
passed on the way down we stepped
back in the hallway and waited

  in a minute it was ascending again
stopped at the floor above and we
heard armont step out and open the
door of apartment no  for an-
other half-minute we waited till the
elevator returned to the main floor

   here spoke my companion
handing me a revolver  stick it in
your pocket and when we start to
search pull it like a real detective
come on

  i followed him up the stairway to
the next floor

  he rang the bell of no  violently
almost instantly it opened and for the
first time i caught a view of george
armonts face

  it was not prepossessing-sallow
skin a drooping blond mustache with
a shifty look in his black close-set eyes
he stared at us inquiringly

   were central-office men spoke
my companion bruskly in a low tone
throwing back his coat and displaying
some sort of a shield  somebody on
the street saw a man come down the
fire-escape from the roof of this house
and disappear in a window of your
apartment

  he stepped in confidently and i fol-
lowed

with your permission well search
armont fell back flustered alarm
showing plainly on his sallow features

   yes-es-certainly-go ahead he
stammered turning and rushing into
the dining-room

   the windows open  he ex-
claimed pointing to it  i didnt no-
tice-i just-came in myself

  quickly he turned pulled open the
lowest drawer of a small bureau by the
wall threw out some wearing apparel


the all-story magazine

and touched a small square tin box
which was thus revealed then with a
sigh of relief closed the drawer again
my companion looked at me signifi-
cantly as the proprietor turned to face
us again

   well search through the rooms
my fellow-conspirator said

  i started for the rear through a
long hall and armont followed me
with drawn revolver i covered the
premises searching systematically in
every closet or other place likely to
afford concealment

  armont watched expectantly over
my shoulder i finished at last

   must have escaped through the
door into the hall i said  guess he
had robbed an apartment in some
neighboring house and just used your
flat as a means of escape

   yes-i guess so replied the man
much relieved evidently assured that
the intruder was not involved in the
affair of the ring

  we returned to the dining-room

   ive searched the front said my
friend awaiting us there and return-
ing his gun to his hip-pocket  guess
he got out through the hall door

   yes-he escaped through this
apartment i contributed  robbed
some apartment next door maybe and
then came down this fire-escape

   guess youre right responded the
other fake detective  lets get after
him the elevator-boy must have seen
him go down-stairs

  we moved to the door i was spec-
ulating as to where he had placed the
tin box it was too bulky to conceal
about his person

   sorry to trouble you he said to
armont apologetically as we stepped
into the hall

   not at all responded the other
and closed the door

  my companion hurried down the
stairs and was out on the street before
i caught up to him

   wheres the box  i queried puz-
zled

  he grinned and passing to the east

side of the house dived into the vacant
lot

  stooping he picked something up off
the ground in the shadow beside the
wall

  he rejoined me the tin box tucked
snugly under his arm and from which
he was in the act of breaking a long
piece of twine which he stpwed care-
fully in his pocket

chapter ix

some swift sidf-stepping

  mr gimlft-eyes turned westward
on emerging from the lot and started
ahead at a rapid pace i keeping close
beside him-on the side nearest the tin
box if he tried to elope with that ar-
ticle his face was doomed to come into
violent contact with a brace of hard
knuckles

   lowered it from the window on a
string i said by way of starting
conversation

   yep-which teaches a moral al-
ways carry a piece of twine in your
pocket replied he  i remember
once in australia when a piece of cot-
ton thread saved my life good story
that

   and this detectives shield i
worked on our friend is a handy thing
too if armont had taken time to ex-
amine it we would never have got the
tin box

   why  

   new york cabmans license-vint-
age of seventy - seven picked i up
in a pawn - shop years ago always
carry it with me when in this town-
always

   i see you have studied your-er-
art down to a fine point i ventured
to remark

   got nothing on you cliff ellis-
not a thing that drunken society
man stunt you pulled on the lady was
about as nifty a piece of work as i ever
saw

  his expansive mouth opened again
to emit a hearty chuckle then he com-
the house of sorcery



menced intoning in a sing-song this
little gem

 by chance i met an actor-man

 who acted the thief as goo as i can
 oh-ho  he-ho

 his voice was about as musical as
 a ton of coal sliding down an iron
 chute

  thats a pretty little thing i com-
 mented  but dont do it often my
 musical ear is rather sensitive

  oh i always sing when i arrive at
 a conclusion he replied unabashed

 really and what conclusion
might you have arrived at now 

  that there is something in back of
 all your acting to-night

  well im not qualifying for black-
 wells island for the fun of the thing
 i agreed  and by the same token i

o	

 opine that you are not either

 you opine correctly he came
back laconically

  where are you steering for now 
 i queried

    to my little three-room flat-this
 street-other side of broadway the
 tin box is locked and well have to pry
 it open

  by the way how did you know i
 was cliff ellis 

  saw you in  the perfect woman 
 last week never forget a face if i
 flash it for a minute or so

  i believe it i assented gazing
 sidewise at those search-light eyes of
 his to find that they were observing me
 the same way  and might i ask your
 name  

  you might

 which is- 

  a difficult question to answer i
 have so many at present it is-but
 that wouldnt enlighten you any i
 only christened myself with it three
 days ago

  see-your term just expired
starting life all over again eh how
long were you up for this last trip
 youre away off cliff ellis he
corrected- away off ive just been
acting the thief like yourself but as

i remarked before-im your humble
disciple some swift side-stepping to-
night cliff my boy

   you pinched the ring-got rid of
kronholtzs man-then pinched the
keys-got armont out of the way-
flagged the lady-and then pinched the
tin box from under its owners very
nose some swift side-stepping-yes
sir 

   you pinched the tin box i dis-
claimed the honor frankly and it
was your scheme it worked admir-
ably

   yes-it will work every time under
like conditions a trait in human na-
ture you know a person will grab
instinctively for that which he or she
prizes most in time of danger thats
what armont did

   and does he prize the tin box more
than anything else i asked inno-
cently

  he was looking at me sidewise again

   maybe was all the satisfaction
he vouchsafed  well here we are

  we had crossed broadway and my
companion turned into the doorway of
a flat-house in the center of the block
on the up-town side he opened the
inner door with a latchkey and led the
way inside the hall

  he applied another key to a door on
the west side and held it open for me
to enter touching a button and flooding
the room with electric light

  i looked about curiously it was a
simply furnished sitting-room showing
evidences of a careless bachelors home
life pie motioned me to a chair of-
fered me a box of cigars and placing
the tin box carefully on the mantel sat
opposite me in an armchair puffing
voluminously on the weed he had
selected pie seemed in no haste i
was

   lets open that tin box i sug-
gested politely

   just a moment he said  first
lets see if we cant arrive at an under-
standing our interests seem to run
parallel-apparently

   you are playing against armont

and his crowd so am i you are
looking for the information in this tin
box so am i whats the answer 
yes-whats the answer i mur-
mured

   do you mind telling- me how you
knew the girl started out with that ring
to the willington  he asked off-
handedly

   i heard her brother phone kron-
holtz and make the arrangements for
passing it along in fact i gave him
the connection on the switchboard

  it occurred to me if  simulated
frankness with him he might loosen up
with a little information himself

   ah i see but how did you hap-
pen to be on the switchboard 

   how did you happen to be waiting
outside the door  i parried seems
to me youre getting more knowledge
than you give

   i generally do he admitted can-
didly his mouth spreading- earward in
that large smile  if i could only fig-
ure out he went on musingly staring
up at the ceiling as if thinking aloud
 how a broadway star is mixed up in
a matter concerning an old ring i
might be able to talk with freedom

   ill save you the trouble of talking
or figuring i said grimly rising sud-
denly and pointing his own revolver
within an inch of one of those immense
ears i couldnt waste any more time
with this up-to-date sphinx it was
easier to just take what i wanted

   now dont stir a finger i warned
moving guardedly toward the tin box
on the mantel in back of him

  he grinned

   that guns empty

  i stared at the barrel sure enough
 cartridges were there i threw it on
a near-by table with a few choice words
and when i glanced savagely at the
grinning man in the armchair it was i
who stared into the muzzle of a vicious-
looking gun

   ill trouble you cliff ellis to pass
over that ring he said softly without
stirrin from his seat

      o

  it was my turn to grin

   while you wre up-stairs in apart-
ment no  j informed him cheer-
fully  a messenger-boy came along
the street i had an inspiration

   i stopped him placed the ring in
an envelope sealed it and scribbled my
own name and address upon it by this
time it is reposing in pigeon-hole  e 
in back of the clerks desk at my hotel
his jaw dropped his keen eyes
scanned mine nonplussed

   search me i encouraged throw-
ing my arms above my head still grin-
ning

  he merely threw his gun after mine
on the table and also voiced a few
choice words

   mines empty too he advertised
avith an answering grin  one has to
be so careful noavadays avith the new
york police theyre so peevish about
anybody but themselves carrying any-
thing loaded well you avorked it
pretty slick i must admit but then i
might have known-

  a strangled hoarse cry broke in on
his discourse coming apparently from
the darkness at the front end of his
three-room flat

   help-help -hes murdering me
-help-he-

  the voice died aaaray in a choking
sob

  my companion sprang from his chair
and shot through an adjoining bed-
chamber to the front room

   tlelp police  sounded the
voice now shrilly this time seemingly
from out-of-doors on the sidewalk

  i avas on the other side of the hall
door in a jiffy my host tumbling back
through the flat after me i threw
open the street door and dashed to the
sideavalk

  there avas nothing but a deserted
stretch of flagged pavements confront-
ing my eyes my host stood framed in
the doorway staring at me mystified

   good night my friend i gibed
him avith a laugh avaving the tin box
tauntingly in his face

  i had picked it from the mantel the 
moment he jumped into the other room
the house oe sorcery



   as well as impersonating i can
also spring a little ventriloquism  oc-
casions i added  and here is the
ring also i enlightened him pulling
it from my vest-pocket and holding it
up in my other hand for his inspection
 ta-ta dear pal some swift side-
stepping old top  i mocked laughing
cruelly at him as i slowly turned to-
ward broadway

  he merely stood there with that wide
grin  his face nodding his head ad-
miringly a twinkle in his gray eyes

  with the tin box hugged close to my
side i left him thus and strode right
merrily away

  and the balmy air of that june night
was disturbed as singing blithesomely
at the top of my lungs in imitation of
that coal-scuttle voice his own original
little ditty floated back to its composers
ears

   by chance i met an actor-man

  who acted the thief as good as i can

  o-ho he-ho

  at the corner of broadway i turned
north glancing back for a last view of
my partner in house-breaking he was
still standing on the stoop of his house
gazing after me

  what was the next thing on the pro-
gram i pondered it was now after
cleven oclock

  what strange proceedings might
have transpired in max leidners house
of sorcery since my departure at nine
in pursuit of the ring i was very
anxious to know and yet here was
this tin box stowed under my arm

  perhaps its contents would make
plain many of the bizarre and unnerv-
ing episodes which had mystified me
this day yes i must investigate my
twice-stolen treasure before rejoining
doris armont in that madison avenue
house then i could better determine
my next move

  with the knowledge thus gained i
might be able to return and force mr
gimlet-eyes to disgorge the riddle of
the ring which i was confident he pos-
sessed

     s

  so coming to this conclusion after
walking several blocks i turned to cross
over to the east side of the avenue and
board an up-town surface car to my
hotel at forty-second street in doing
so i almost collided with two men di-
rectly behind me who were in the midst
of an angry altercation as they walked

   you know where she is  shouted
the smaller man of the two to his burly
companion  ill follow you till i find
out you cur youve broken up my
home-robbed me of my wife and
youll settle with me-ill shoot you
like a dog 

  and he made a movement toward
his hip-pocket

  it looked as if i was about to wit-
ness a murder i dropped in line in
back of them ready to grab his arm
if he started anything the little fel-
lows other hand was excitedly clutch-
ing the arm of the giant towering be-
side him

   let go you little runt  growled
the big fellow trying to disengage his
arm and keeping a wary eye on his
outraged companion  youre crazy
i dont know where your wife is let
go-i say  

  but the small chap was now hanging
desperately onto his arm with both his
hands the other lifted his free arm
the massive paw clenched and started
a vicious swing for the jaw of his un-
dersized antagonist

  i had come up alongside and as the
flail-like arm swung i jumped in front
to protect the little fellow and with
my free hand grasped the avrist of the
other and pushed it to his side

  you big bully i said you
ought to be shot for trying anything
like that on a man his size

  my blood was up i never could tol-
erate a bully

  he glared at me taken aback at this
unexpected- interference

 who gave you a license to stick
your nose in other folks affairs he
sneered  you dressed-up dude may-
be you think you are my size then 
he sprang back quickly and squared


the all-story magazine

off belligerently at the same time start-
ing that big arm of his swinging dan-
gerously again

  look out shouted the little fel-
low whose grip on the others arm had
been shaken off easily

  already a crowd of people was rap-
idly collecting about us men running
from all directions to see the commo-
tion a street fight in new york can
produce an audience quicker than any
other attraction on earth

  i did not relish such notoriety but
my antagonist had accompanied his
swinging arm with a few low-spoken
words which were anything but com-
plimentary

   here  i said to the little chap be-
side me whose cause i was champion-
ing

  i gave him the tin box to hold and
threw up my guard swinging my own
right as a certain notable ring-artist
had once taught me

  my opponents demeanor suddenly
changed a slinking look came over
his bullying face and apparently losing
all desire for an encounter on seeing
my readiness turned and ducked
quickly through the crowd

  i started after him but the curious
onlookers had pressed in about me and
he was soon out of sight

  i looked around for the little chap
with the tin box

  and he also had disappeared

   some swift side-stepping cliff
ellis a familiar voice murmured be-
hind me  some swift side-stepping old
pal

  i spun round on my heel mr gim-
let-eyes was looking up into my
countenance with that all-embracing
smile of his

   or as one would say in the lan-
guage of the classics stung he sup-
plemented unnecessarily

  i could not muster even a stage grin
but i had once worked among long-
shoremen and i now recalled some
of their inimitable language giving
audible expression to my recollections

  the crowd of disappointed figbt-

fans had melted as swiftly as it gath-
ered we two stood there facing each
other under the garish lights of the
great white way

   pretty tough old pal that cavern-
mouth was voicing in mock sympathy
 pretty tough after pulling that ven-
triloquist stuff to fall down thusly
ah well tis the fortune of war

   cease your idle prattle i said
recovering somewhat of my aplomb
 tell me-how did you stage this act-
on such short notice 

  there was far more than the ordi-
nary amount of curiosity in my tones

  fate was kind brother-very
kind he obliged cheerfully  no
sooner had yon turned the corner of
my street than my two men appeared
coming from sixth avenue and as
we three followed swiftly in your foot-
steps i originated the act then and
there and rehearsed them in their parts
prettv good for a first performance
eh

   very good i agreed with sorrow

   it is kind of you to say so he
murmured  actors are so terribly
jealous of each other these days well
i must be going the little fellow
whose wife was stolen will be back to
the three-room flat with the tin box
by this time hes a fine sprinter for
his size oh ive just thought of a
new song

   i stole the box and along you came

  you stole it from me and i stole it
      again

  o-ho  he-ho  

  again a vision of coal sliding down
a scuttle was suggested to me as he
sang

   am i to infer that you have again
arrived at a conclusion as in the case
of your former selection  i inquired
humbly

   you are

  which is

   that you are going to call again
soon at my three-room flat to see if
you cannot presume upon our friend-
ship to extract from me the informa-
tion which the tin box contains that
the house of sorcery



is my conclusion which goes with my
song

   i believe you are a mind-reader
after all i voiced admiringly  so
you consider me a friend 

   perhaps

  he was staring at my hand with
those search-light orbs of his

   ah that explains it he said softly
as if communing with himself

   explains what 

   why you now have the ring on
your finger while you were in that
crowd a minute ago i was very much
disappointed on going through your
various pockets not to be able to get
my fingers on it some swift side-
stepping there cliff old boy good
night

  as i stood watching him in open ad-
miration as he hurried back down
broadway whistling the crazy air of
his little ditty at the top of his lungs
there was no answering joy in my heart
for song but like him i had also
come to a conclusion which i mur-
mured sorrowfully to myself it was
this

   any mortal who judges your brains
by your idiotic music is doomed to a
sad awakening sooner or later--mostly
sooner

chapter x
the boneless man

  with such a remarkably resourceful
rascal as mr gimlet-eyes to deal with
it behooved me to get this much-sought-
after ring in a safer place than about
my person the next thing i realized
he would be working some original
scheme to slip it from my finger with-
out my knowing i had lost it

  the respect i had felt for him an
hour ago had increased a hundred-
fold after being robbed of the tin
box in this brazen way i didnt doubt
for a minute that i would soon be bereft
of the ring if i did not soon dispose of
it somewhere

  i boarded an up-town surface car

determined to place the ring in the hotel
safe for the time being then i would
journey back to max leidners house
and see if doris armont needed my
services in those few short blocks as
i sat in the car i speculated with a con-
suming curiosity upon the various
phases of this riddle of the ring

  i stared in fascination at the odd
gold band encircling my finger what
a strange history it must possess-and
doris had hidden it away since she was
seven years old and yet knew nothing
about it

  but of its importance there could be
no doubt george armont had shad-
owed its owner all the way from ber-
lin to secure it and here in new york
appeared his clever sister kronholtz
and his man and gimlet-eyes and his
two allies-all completely absorbed in
the ruby-incrusted ring and going
through a variety of unheard-of ma-
neuvers to possess it

  the chances my late partner in crime
had taken to secure the tin box proved
just how imperative this affair of the
ring was to him who was he what
could he possibly gain by its posses-
sion he was no ordinary gentleman
of the highway that was certain i
believed him when he said that he
was merely  acting the thief like
myself

  with no solution to all my self-pro-
pounded queries i alighted from the
car at forty-second street at least
happy in the thought that the resource-
ful person who had robbed me of the
tin box had not also taken the ring in
five minutes i emerged from the hotel
having witnessed the cashier stow the
precious ornament in the safe along
with other valuables and i breathed a
great sigh of relief

  in another minute i was in a taxicab
gliding swiftly toward the residence on
madison avenue this brought back
to my mind all those strange mysteries
connected with the house of sorcery
which the pursuit of the ring hadrele-
gated to the background for the last two
hours


the all-story magazine

   i thought of the inexplicable plight
of the girl to whom i had this day been
betrothed-of the extraordinary in-
fluence the laughable bent-boned leid-
ner exercised over her-of our strange
marriage agreement-of the odd hap-
penings in that house on seventy-
second street-of my friend jim
bradworths unaccountable connection
with the affairs of leidner

   when i came to that i had to take
myself firmly in hand and deliberately
shut the matter from my mind for if
i again commenced revolving the riddle
of  who is jim bradworth if he is not
himself this taxicab would surely
land me in the insane ward of bellevue
hospital instead of max leidners
home

   as if all this jumble of mysteries was
not enough i had now been confronted
with the riddle of the ring

   good heavens-did any mortal ever
tumble into such a brain-baffling mix-up
all in one short day and some folks
contend that life in a big city like new
york is prosaic humdrum uneventful

  with a  whats going to hit me
next  air i walked up the steps of the
madison avenue house after dismiss-
ing the taxicab i felt reasonably sure
that doris had not retired for the night
she would be waiting for me as i had
promised over the telephone to rejoin
her

   i opened the door with my key all
was quiet the gas chandelier was
burning low in the hall the front room
was dark but a stream of light in the
rear room penetrated from between the
faded red portieres which were now
drawn back across the connecting door-
way so i closed the hall-door behind
me softly and tiptoed into that front
room

   an astounding sight met my aston-
ished eyes

   the rear room was lighted by a red-
shaded lamp which stood upon a small
round mahogany table the place was
even more scantily furnished than the
room in which i stood

  two armchairs an old-fashioned

high-backed settee and a tattered rug
here and there-that was all- but seat-
ed on the settee was the most outland-
ish-looking creature i ever saw-ex-
cepting max leidner

  he appeared like an east indian
judging by the color of his skin and a
slight facial resemblance to that nation-
ality-but there the similarity ended

  the man was clothed only in a loin-
cloth and a flowing white robe em-
broidered with some oriental material
which fell loosely from his shoulders
to the floor it was caught about his
neck by a silken cord the garment
had no- sleeves - merely armholes-
through these his bare arms hung

  and such arms  they dangled limp-
ly at his sides seemingly boneless but
even while i watched he moved them
and they twisted this way and that with
a sinuous gliding motion like two
snakes his bare limbs also protruded
from the folds of the white robe and
they were twined limply about each
other like pieces of string

  his body moved while i was observ-
ing this and it was just as sinuous as
his arms and legs his neck oscillated
from side to side but his face was
even more remarkable the swarthy
sharp features were repellent and
brutal and with every expression his
whole countenance responded - his
nose chin and cheeks moving with the
suppleness of a piece of rubber

  the man was apparently absolutely
boneless

  it was the same specter whose ghost-
like appearance as he flung up the stairs
while i was talking to max leidner a
few hours ago had momentarily de-
prived me of the power of speech

  but even more startling to me than
the mere sight of this creature was what
i had observed in the first comprehen-
sive glance

  sitting beside this unearthly creature
her beautiful head resting on his shoul-
der weeping while low sobs struck my
ears-was doris armont

  after the first shock this astounding
tableau administered to me had partly
the house oe sorcery



subsided a great wave of passion seized
me here was this surpassingly beauti-
ful girl-my fianccc-resting her head
upon the shoulder of a creature neither
man nor beast and sobbing her heart
out to him

  i dont know just what restrained me
from leaping into that room and stran-
gling him so infuriated was i with

o o

blind overwhelming jealousy it was
the first warning i had had of just how
dear that girl had already become to me
in a few short hours acquaintance

  restrain myself i did however half
paralyzed i judge by the fascination of
this weird spectacle

  in a few moments her sobs ceased
and still resting her head upon his
shoulder she looked up into his beast-
like face with glistening eyes both love
and pity unmistakably expressed on hel-
per feet features  then she began speak-
ing- in a low tone but i could not catch
her words

  ever and anon the repulsive thing be-
side her either nodded or shook his head
in response with a quick snappy mo-
tion as if his neck operated on springs
evidently he had no power of speech

  he only stared straight ahead of him
with his sharp glistening black eyes
at last doris armont raised her glori-
ous head from his shoulder and the
creature prepared to rise

  his legs twisted round each other
freed themselves like two reptiles un-
coiling together slowly his sinuous
body straightened and he rose up on
those extraordinary limbs when he
stood erect he was over six feet in
height

  for a long moment he remained thus
surveying the girl while she met his
glance with that same look of mingled
love and pity then he turned swiftly
as easily as a top spins round and
passed to the hall door with great
strides

  yet the movements of his limbs could
not be called strides either it was a
different walk than that possessed by
any living man or beast the knees did
not bend neither did the heel first leave

the floor before the toes the only thing
i can accurately compare his legs to is
the gliding curved body of a reptile
passing along the ground-with the dif-
ference that they were perpendicular

  each limb curved backward and for-
ward several times with every step in-
stantly straightening as soon as the foot
touched the floor to again curve and
twist witli the succeeding step as soon
as the sole of the foot came in contact
with the floor it sprang away again like
a rubber ball causing the creatures
body to move forward with astounding
ease and smoothness

  he disappeared in the hall without a
sound and almost instantly i spied him
passing the door of the darkened room
in which i stood in another instant
he had bounded up the stairway three
or four steps at a time without the
slightest sound his flying white robe
trailing behind giving him the appear-
ance of an apparition i was convinced
then and there that he could have-
cleared the whole stairway just as easily
in one bound

  as i stood staring after that specter
a queer feeling came over me that i had
gazed upon an inhabitant of some other
planet the creature certainly pos-
sessed physical powers that no mortal
ever did what was it  where had it
come from

  then i recalled that it seemed to un-
derstand the girls words so dazed and
stupefied i glanced in the other room
skgain

  doris avas sitting staring before her
body bent forward hands clasped a
look of utter misery upon her face i
remembered those tears she had shed
avhile sobbing on that beings shoulder
the look of pity-yes even love-upon
her features

  and all for such a beast the
thought was too much i strode for-
avard from the darkness of that room
and stood framed in the doonvay be-
tween the red portieres

  she looked up startled and stared at
me her big broavn eyes avide avith
fright


the all-story magazine

   oh-it is-you  

   yes i said rather curtly i must
admit i strode forward into the room
and stood over her my accusing eyes
fixing hers sternly

   wh-when did you arrive  she
stammered

   in time to see the-performance
i retorted dryly

   you saw him  

   yes -- saw you weeping on his
shoulder have you anything-er-to
say   i queried coldly

  she stared past me her fingers twist-
ing nervously her face perplexed and
troubled then she arose and stood
looking straight into my eyes

   im sorry you witnessed-this she
began her voice shaken  you cannot
possibly comprehend the situation and

i-dare not tell you

 why

   max leidner has forbidden me

   have i not some rights as your
fiance to be enlightened a little as to
your conduct with this - er - man
beast or whatever it is  i asked ut-
terly exasperated

   oh cliff she implored calling me
by my surname for the first time as she
looked at me pitifully with beseeching
eyes  i dont know what to say-what
to tell you without divulging the whole
thing and i cannot do that-must not
-no no 

   how many matters are there which
transpire in this house of which you
dare not speak  i asked beginning to
lose my temper  i should think this
affair between you and leidner is
sufficient

   and this is that same matter her
words came quietly

   what  i ejaculated dumfounded
 yes-about this man you saw here
a moment ago revolves the whole affair
between leidner and myself

   good heavens  i gasped and
sank into a chair staring at her in utter
bewilderment  you are willing to
marry me-a stranger-or any one else
leidner might have chosen because of
that-that creature 

   not-not exactly on his account
the girl answered looking entirely
miserable  oh cliff i wish i could
tell you all-all but i cannot-my lips
are sealed

   please-please wont you have
faith in me-wont you believe in me
and try to bear all this in patience and
fortitude you will know all as soon
as we are married id give my right
arm to tell you 

   i know exactly what a monstrous
thing the whole affair must appear to
you oh-im so sorry leidner ever
selected you-for your sake  

  she turned and sank prostrate on the
settee with a stifled sob and buried her
face in the pillows

  my jealous anger and suspicions van-
ished as if they never had found lodg-
ment in my being i fell on my knees
by the settee and put my arm about her
shaking shoulders and caressed her hair
soothingly with my hand

   doris-my doris i whispered en-
treatingly  please dont forgive me
for hurting you im a brute you
have more to bear now without me ma-
king you miserable i have faith in you
for anything no matter what may hap-
pen from now on i swear i will not mis-
trust you again please dont cry say
you forgive me wont you dear  

  quickly her sobbing ceased she
lifted her head from the pillows and sat
erect

  her arms stretched toward me and
she took my head between her dear
hands and gazed into my eyes with her
own brimming with unshed tears

  a contented smile came over her
glorious features slowly her head bent
toward me and she pressed her warm
red lips to mine in a long lingering kiss
which sent the blood rioting through
my veins

  forgive you she whispered
ecstatically  dearest it is i that must
beg your forgiveness you are won-
derful-wonderful no man ever did
for a woman what you are doing for
me oh im so happy now - so
happy 
the house of sorcery



   why dear

   because i realize now that you love
me-for myself alone she buried her
head on my shoulder her warm cheek
pressed close to mine

  for a long minute we remained thus
i could have stayed in that delicious
position for hours-but there was work
to do gently i raised her head and
kissed her for the first time full on
those red lips then i rose and seated
myself beside her

   lets not discuss this-this matter
any more i said  assume that it
never happened-that i never saw it
i want to tell you about your ring

   oh yes-the ring 

  she snuggled close in my arms and
in the intoxication of her body against
mine i forgot for the time that only a
few minutes before she had been sitting
in this very place with her head upon
that unearthly beasts shoulder

  i recounted briefly all the salient
points in the pursuit of the ring when
i finished she sat lost in wondering
thought for several minutes

    o

   i do not understand-it is a com-
plete mystery to me

   yes-to me also i replied  but
it will not be a mystery much longer
i have a plan whereby i think  can
extract some information from this
woman whose name also is doris ar-
mont if not i think that mr gimlet-
eyes can enlighten me have you any
relative bearing the same name as your-
self

   no she answered puzzled  not
to my knowledge

   i rose at last and she accompanied me
to the door

   ill see you early in the morning
i said  guess ill be pretty busy the
rest of the night by the appearance of
things good night doris 

chapter xi

doris armont no 

  peremptorily dismissing from my
mind for the present all thoughts of the

strange episode of the boneless being i
had just encountered in the house of
sorcery i hurried westward through
the side street toward broadway pass-
ing the point where at five oclock that
afternoon i had greeted my friend jim
bradworth

  somewhere a bell was chiming the
hour of midnight

  i had evolved a plan for again meet-
ing doris armont no  and endeavor-
ing by a little subterfuge to extract
from her the riddle of the ring

  i had remembered her brothers
warning over the telephone to kron-
holtz respecting the two friends who
were shadowing him also evidently
interested in the ring and after my
experience with mr gimlet-eyes two
men it somehow struck me forcibly that
they were the individuals in question

  in my contemplated interview with
the girl it was my plan to pose as the
agent for these parties i would tell
her that they had employed me to secure
the ring without enlightening me in the
least concerning its history and now
after successfully accomplishing my
mission i had led them to believe that i
had not yet secured it

  my reason for this i would tell her
was that i had been convinced of its
impqrtance to so many people and
therefore considered my services worth
more than they were paying me

  consequently if she could show me
where it was worth my while to play
the game with her she could have the
ring

  it was a long shot-but there was
just a bare possibility that it might score
a bulls-eye i had been taking such
ticklish chances all my life and i rather
relished the prospects this adventure
opened up to my imagination

  before my theatrical career had made
of me an eminently respectable in-
dividual in the eyes of society i had
led an existence which though not
criminal was nothing to brag about

  suffice it to say that necessity had
long ago sharpened my wits and taught
me how to emplo my humble talents to


the all-story magazine

the best possible advantage in a pinch
and i had been in several such

  so i entered a telephone booth in a
broadway drug-store and called the
girls number i was certain that she
would not have yet retired there
would be little sleep in apartment no
 this night

  and then came the  hello  in that
feminine voice i had learned so well

   hello i replied  this is the
party who left you some time ago in
the willington hotel i am anxious to
meet you concerning that ring

   yes-why-where  came her be-
wildered voice

   at the willington again you
must not inform any one the matter
is confidential between us where is
your brother  

   he is with kronholtz somewhere
looking-

   yes i understand can you meet
me at once  

   yes came her eager response

   good you will not be sorry ill
be waiting at the entrance of the will-
ington for you please hurry

   ill be there in ten minutes she re-
plied promptly

   very well good-by

  i hung up the receiver and walked
toward the willington very much
elated with the success of my little
scheme thus far i entered the hotel
and arranged for a private dining-room
then i took my station at the street en-
trance and waited

  i had not long to wait a taxicab
drew to the curb coming from the
south

  the chauffeur alighted held open the
door and the girl with the orange plume
in her hat stepped quickly to the side-
walk and advanced toward me smiling
with those uncommon eyes of hers

   rather an unusual hour to make an
appointment i answered her smile
doffing my hat  but the matter is im-
perative

   yes i understand she responded
in her musical tones  i see you are
quite-er-sober now

  she was glancing at me roguishly
out of the corner of her eye

   quite i retorted laughingly as i
conducted her inside  i have ar-
ranged for a private dining-room where
we can talk without interruption

  she nodded her head an attendant
conducted us up-stairs to a cozy little
room and left us there to summon a
waiter

  the girl was quite at ease she
placed on the table the gold mesh-bag
which i knew so well and surveyed her-
self in an immense gilt-framed mirror
dabbing at her hair as women will

   will you have supper or do you
only care to refresh yourself with
some champagne while we talk i
asked

   just champagne thank you she
smiled back through the mirror

  the waiter appeared and i ordered
we seated ourselves at opposite sides
of the square table set for two and she
surveyed me appraisingly-with a cer-
tain frank admiration in her changeable
eyes

   will you please imitate my voice  
she said at last a propos of nothing

  i obliged promptly by saying in her
exact tones  ill hold him till you ar-
rive-the drunken fool 

  she gasped

   well pm convinced now she
said

   of what 

   when kronholtz and my brother
told me how you had fooled them over
the phone i told them very plainly just
what idiots they were but they
werent i was

  the waiter returned writh the liquid
refreshment served two glasses and
retired closing the door

   now we can talk undisturbed i
said  heres to a better acquaint-
ance

  she touched her glass to mine play-
fully and laughingly added   heres
hoping your wife does not telephone
you before we are through

  no there will be no telephoning
this trip i assured
the house of sorcery



   and not satisfied with the ring
you had to steal the tin box too she
said shaking her head approvingly

   oh so you discovered its loss 

   yes my brother did i asked him
to describe the two detectives and
one of them was the  drunken fool 
whom i knew-alas  to my sorrow

   how did your brother get back so
quickly to the apartment   i asked
curiously  i figured i would have at
least an hour to search

   why kronholtzs man quickly lost
patience waiting at the garford and
came back to the writing-room down-
stairs to see why i couldnt get rid of
you the carriage attendant on the
sidewalk had observed you walk down
broadway so we spent half an hour in
a wild-goose chase

   meanwhile my brother at the st
claire also became impatient and came
here looking for me not finding any
one he started back for the house
having a suspicion that something was
wrong

   must have been some excitement
when you all got together and com-
pared notes i hinted

   rather kronholtzs man and my-
self came back to the writing-room in
a vain hope of meeting you even
then t was not sure that i had been
tricked

   i thought you might have gone in
search of a fewr more drinks intoxi-
cated persons are so erratic you know
but you were still missing

   then i reluctantly realized i had
been outrageously fooled i telephoned
my brother who had returned to the
apartment by that time he came here
at once

   meanwhile we phoned kronholtz
wh also joined us i guess t heard
some choice language from those two
after we all told our little stories my
but men can loose their language on oc-
casions

   when my brother described you as
one of the detectives i suggested that
he go back to the apartment and look
for the tin box

   we all returned together and if
you had been there then murder would
surely have been done this night it
was pretty work-very pretty she
concluded sipping her wine her ex-
pressive eyes alight with wondering
admiration and she was very cool and
unconcerned withal

   flow did you learn about the red
carnation   she asked at last

   oh i was employed by certain
people to watch you folks i replied
easily putting emphasis  the  cer-
tain  happened to be hanging round
the hall when no  appeared on the
switchboard the hall-boy was up-
stairs with the elevator so i obliged
thus i got your brothers instructions
to kronholtz

   well we figured it out that way
she said  but couldnt realize just how
it was accomplished the elevator-boy
swore he hadnt answered the call and
we at once suspected him of being
mixed up in it somehow it is all plain
now though

   very simple i supplemented

   no-it was the most complicated
sleight-of-hand i ever participated in
she affirmed with a positive shake of
her head  and that impersonation
of the inebriated gentleman was quite
the most convincing acting that any one
ever performed you would certainly
have made a wonderful actor she
volunteered frankly

   do you think so   i asked inno-
cently

   cant place you among the noto-
rious gentlemen of fortune she con-
tinued a little perplexed frown on her
forehead  what name do the-er-
authorities know you by 

   theyve never got close enough to
me to know me by any name i lied
easily  my-er-little exploits are
generally executed in such a way that
some other poor devil receives the hon-
ors from the police

  ah i can readily believe that
she rejoined laughing merrily

   again she fell to sipping at her glass
her wonderful eyes meanwhile study-


the all-story magazine

ing my face with a certain impudent
frankness which showed to me an un-
usually clever mind in back of them
in this unusual situation knowing how
i had qorne into possession of the ring
and tin box which was so all important
to her she was seemingly as indifferent
and unconcerned as any young lady
merely enjoying an after-theater sup-
per with her escort

  any other woman could not have
thus long contained her curiosity but
would have immediately inquired as to
the object of this meeting and yet
i knew that her natural feminine in-
stinct to be enlightened was consuming
her

   now that we understand each other
better i smiled  ill explain my rea-
son for wishing to see you

  she nodded her head and producing
a gold cigarette-case from her bag se-
lected one of its dainty little contents
i furnished a light and with a  thank
ou she placed it to her lips with a
practised hand and raised her arching
eyebrows a trifle as a signal for me to
proceed

   as i stated before i continued
certain parties employed me to watch
you and your brother with the object
of securing the ring

   yes i know them-cutler and
warnham she nodded

   yes-cutler and warnham i
confirmed glad to get this important
information so easily

   and who is this other party who
played detective with you   she
queried

   oh i secured him to help me i
lied glibly  an old confederate of
mine who works well in harness with
me

   he does she assented with a con-
vincing nod of her head

   well cutler and warnham left me
absolutely in the dark as to why they
wanted the ring and tin box all i
knew was that it was up to me to get
them but after getting into the game
and seeing all the complicated maneu-
vers its- transfer entailed it struck me

that my services in the matter were
worth far more than even the large
commission they promised me

   they probably are she said en-
couragingly watching me with mo-
mentarily increasing interest

   well i drawled puffing on my
own cigarette and leaning a little for-
ward as i looked her straight in the
eyes  im open to any proposition you
care to make me for that ring and tin
box but it must be a good one

  she took several meditative puffs
never losing my glance for a moment
her face was impassive but her eyes
shot forth a myriad of expressions
seeming to change color chameleonlike
with each photographed thought of
their owner

   at last she deftly flicked the ash with
her dainty little finger and said quietly
if i was sure of you i could name
you a reward which would beat any-
thing you ever obtained for any of your
no doubt numerous clever exploits

    it would have to go some i re-
piled  but what proof do you want
that i am playing fair with you  

   i-dont-know she hesitated
 this is a big game-a very big game
you havent the faintest conception
just how big it is i must be cau-
tious

   evidently your game is dead
though without possession of the ring
i hazarded

    it is she agreed frankly

   whats the answer then   i asked
indifferently  ive got the ring you
want it and im willing to let you have
it-for a price im perfectly fair with
you there is no sentiment in this thing
with me a matter of business-pure
and simple

  again she puffed meditatively for a
full minute her lightning brain ap-
praising me shrewdly with the assist-
ance of those two unusual eyes

   do you know she began at last
smilingly leaning over the table toward
me  ive taken a great liking to you 
i admire any one who can fool me
youre the first man ive ever been
the house of sorcery



able to admire that way-for youre the
first who ever fooled me

   thank you  murmured

   you speak of your price came
her musical tones softly  i could
name you a price that would astound
you but the reward i have in mind
to offer is even better than that but
it will require you to live a lie for the
rest of your life-to bury your identity
in that of another

   and yet it is easy-and the reward
is princely for such a stake do you
think you would be willing to live such
a lie she finished staring at me in-
tently her eyes alight with the gravity
of that which was in her mind

   i would i answered without a
moments hesitation  life is one big
game of poker to me ill play my
hand as you want me to if youll let me
sit in this game-and deal fair

   ill deal fair she responded her
breath coming quickly her mobile fea-
tures expressive of a supreme delight
at my answer  i knew youd play
she added happily  and when i get
through talking youll bless your lucky
stars that you decided to see me before
turning over that ring and now im
going to tell you the whole story you
and  will work together on this thing
-share and share alike

   let her go i encouraged leaning
back comfortably in my chair to listen

chapter xii

i solve the ring riddle

   but first-have you really got that
ring  asked my companion cautiously
 you didnt turn it over to cutler or
warnham 

   if youll wait here about fifteen
minutes ill go and get it i volun-
teered

  never mind i believe you let
me see-it is a long story and i might
as well begin at the beginning in the
first place my name is not doris ar-
mont and neither is the other party my
brother

   really  i exclaimed with quite a
little genuine surprise

   what our real names are is imma-
terial just now suffice it to say that
this ring is the property of a girl named
doris armont who is about my own
age she has owned it since she was
a mere child without realizing its his-
tory or its value

   by chance this man who passes as
my brother became mixed up in the
affair in this way he has done certain
work of a more or less shady nature
for a man who stands high in affairs
of state in germany his name is
count stalheim a month ago my
partner george armont - as we will
call him for convenience-while in
berlin was introduced by count stal-
heim to the affair of the ring and
the story the count told him was this

   prince ferdinand helfonstein the
last of a long line of princes of the
house of helfonstein had visited
america some twenty-seven odd years
ago while yet a young man he was
traveling incognito

   he met a very beautiful and ac-
complished young widow in detroit
fell desperately in love with her like a
true scion of his royal race and mar-
ried her he disclosed to her his iden-
tity of course but assured her that he
could overcome all family objections
to his alliance with one who was not
of royal blood as he was the younger
son and his brother had therefore fallen
heir to the castle and estates and also
the title of prince of helfonstein upon
his fathers death two years before

   but it so happened that he received
a cable shortly after his honeymoon
just as he was planning to take his
american bride back home and the
despatch informed him that his brother
had been thrown from a horse instant-
ly killed-and thus he was now the
reigning prince of the house of hel-
fonstein

   well prince ferdinand head of
the house of plelfonstein as he now
was realized that his marriage to his
bride would never be countenanced


the all-story magazine

and that it would mean the losing of all
the family inheritance-everything
he would be an outcast

   he went back home to assume his
duties promising his wife that he
would endeavor to influence the powers
that be to took favorably upon his
marriage and meanwhile his wife
waited and waited but the reports he
sent her were entirely discouraging

   a daughter was born of this mar-
riage and shortly after the mother died
evidently of a broken heart she real-
ized that her husband had practically
deserted her she had moved to an-
other city after prince ferdinand de-
parted assumed the name of her first
husband and so the child of the prince
was known as-

   doris armont i murmured like
one in a dream

  everything about me was swimming
hazily before my eyes my own voice
sounded very strange and distant to my
ears

   yes-how did you know  asked
the woman before me with a start

   oh i said pulling myself to-
gether with a tremendous effort  
just surmised it

   yes-of course she assented
 that ring was given to ferdinand by
his father upon his death-bed he was
his favorite son the ring had been
handed down from father to son for
generations it bears the coat of arms
of the ancient house of helfonstein-
a shield with a lions head and a mailed
fist and ferdinand on leaving for
germany gave it to his bride as a token
and a promise that he would return to
claim her

   of course he could not gain the
consent of the ruling powers to recog-
nize this morganatic marriage as it
was considered and then he heard of
his avifes death he avas filled avith
remorse-he avas neaer the same man
from that day until his death tavo
months ago he never avould consent
to marry various avomen of royal blood
who avere selected for him and so died
a broken-hearted man

  i muttered some arague words under
my breath hardly able to folloav this
astounding recital

   pardon me   inquired my vis-
a-vis

   nothing at all i hastened to say
 please proceed

  his avas a rather odd death which
has neaer been fully explained in
fact it avas a murder attendants
hearing a pistol-shot rushed into his
apartments in his castle outside a small
german village and avitnessed a most
peculiar spectacle

   prince ferdinand stood avith a
smoking revolver in his hand but
some unheard-of thing had happened
to him flis body was all bent and
deformed as if some giant had taken
and crushed it leaving the bones all
misshapen-twisted in all sorts erf
grotesque shapes as no human bones
avere ever meant to be

  i articulated some unintelligible
thing aloud avith a hoarse gasp and
half rose from my chair only to fall
back weak and inert i avas thinking
of max leidner-it avas his descrip-
tion 

   go on-go on  i uttered aveakly
to the girl  such things exercise my
imagination-i am so susceptible i
added in explanation of my over-
avhelming astonishment

   the attendants hardly recognized
their master so transformed and uely

	o

avas his poor broken body prince
ferdinand pointed to something on
the floor and avaaed them out of the
room frantically

    go he commanded  or you avill
meet my fate  

   they tumbled out and he fol-
lowed them and in the presence of
some -of his guests he told as best he
could avhat awful calamity had over-
taken him

   it appears that when a young man
before his visit to america there had
lived on this estate a poor peasant
woman avith a son avho had been ter-
ribly deformed since birth the un-
fortunate was in his early twenties at
the house of sorcery



that time and it appears that one day
while prince ferdinand was riding
past the peasants cottage he saw this
youth all bent and deformed in the
doorway

   the prince spoke to him and when
the young man answered his jaw wab-
bled in such a crazy way that it moved
ferdinand to laughter the boy was
so enraged that he hurled some vile
names at him and so incensed was the
prince that he had him and his mother
driven from the village

   no more was seen or heard of him
till on this night two months ago his
misshapen form appeared outside one
of the open windows in the room
where prince ferdinand sat quietly-
smoking

  ila prince ferdinand he
called through the window  thirty
years ago you laughed at me he who
laughs last laughs best 

   and with that he threw something
into the room which he had concealed
under a long black cloak

   it was an immense black cat all
twisted and deformed like himself
the beast came wabbling on its twist-
ed legs toward the prince where he had
arisen from his chair

   at the unearthly spectacle of this
monstrous creature he backed away to-
ward the wall but the cat still followed
him its yellow eyes seeming to glare
hypnotically and as the prince leaned
against the wall paralyzed with fright
it advanced and rubbed its unsightly
body against his limbs

   and then prince ferdinand said a
strange feeling swept over him-like
some mad fever racing through his
veins every bone in his body seemed
to melt into liquid he sprang away
from that frightful beast and pulling
a revolver he always carried shot it

   before the smoke cleared away his
bones seemed to harden again he
said he could feel it-just as if a thou-
sand darts of hard steel had shot
through his body

   even as he stood there staring at
the dead cat his bones hardened instant-

ly permanently and left his body all
twisted and broken in that posture so
this was the astounding tale he told to
those about him

  my body was leaning far across the
table my mouth agape my ears drink-
ing in every word of her recital which
was given in a dramatic tone and with
expressive gestures of her supple hands
which would have done credit to any
actress for my part i had forgotten
myself entirely - too dumfounded to
act myself or attempt to play the role
i had assumed with her

  i was jolted clean out of my senses
for the moment again i saw myself
in that house of sorcery a glass cage
suspended from the ceiling while the
black cat all twisted and malformed
glared at me with its yellow eyes-

  interesting is it not she said
taking a true story-tellers pride in the
impression she had made

   yes-very interesting i whis-
pered my lips and tongue dry and
parched

   it is a long tale you see she said
half apologetically  but i must tell
it fully so that you will understand this
little game of the ring

   yes-of course omit nothing
please im deeply interested i assure
you

  if she only knew just what reasons
i had for being interested

   well after a while they screwed
up courage to go into the room and
look at the dead cat it was dissected
and examined by scientists and medical
experts but they were all left hope-
lessly at sea the animals flesh was
apparently as normal and healthy as
any other feline

   only its bones were unusual they
were brown-almost black-and twist-
ed in all sorts of weird shapes and
they were as hard as chilled steel
apparently death rid the brute of all
power to communicate the unheard-of
disease to any living thing

   no sign of the perpetrator of the
ghastly deed could be found anywhere
he had vanished as if the darkness of


the all-story magazine

that fateful april night had swallowed
him up

   as for prince ferdinand the hor-
rors of that night made of him a gib-
bering lunatic his plight was pitiful
he was continually crying out the
cat-the cat take it away  but at
last merciful death ended his misery

   now we come to the real story in
which you and i are interested this
count stalheim i mentioned for whom
george armont had rendered certain
services told him what i have told you

   oh yes-i forgot to mention that
prince ferdinand for many years be-
fore his death had spent immense sums
of money in hiring private detectives
to search the world for his daughter
whose name is doris armont the
prince was filled with remorse for the
manner in which he had deserted his
bride years ago and wanted to atone
as much as possible by finding his
daughter and settling a fortune upon
her

   but it seems that the first husband
of the deserted bride had left a for-
tune as well as a son who was called
george armont so doris and her
half-brother had ample money with
which they traveled in all parts of the
world several times the princes
emissaries obtained slight clues of the
girls whereabouts but they were never
able to locate her

   but at last a little over a month
aso after ferdinands death this
count stalheim who was an enemy
of the prince heard that the girl was
in berlin cn route to america

   he was familiar with every detail
of the story as he had some trusted
attendants in the princes household
who kept him closely informed-and
as luck would have it this supposed
brother of mine was executing a com-
mission for the count at the time

   pie was the very man he required
for his scheme so it was not long
before my partner located the missing
heiress in a berlin hotel where she was
stopping totally ignorant of the fact
that her unknown father had died in

his castle only a few miles away from
the german metropolis

   but this was not all the count had
learned he also had agents tracing
the girl for years in hopes of discover-
ing something in connection with the
princes secret marriage which would
not prove creditable and he learned
that which prince ferdinands agents
were unable to uncover

   it appears that his american bride
had really been the young daughter of
a prince whose family is directly re-
lated to the reigning house of austria
she eloped secretly with an american
millionaire named armont and so in-
censed was her father that he gave out
the report that she had died while trav-
eling in the united states and from
that day to this the report was never
questioned and she never came for-
ward to establish her identity-not
even informing her second husband
prince ferdinand that she was of royal
blood

   she was proud and when the
prince chose between her and his title
to reign over the house of helfon-
stein she never enlightened him
therefore the marriage was not mor-
ganatic after all and if she had de-
clared herself she could have taken her
place beside her husband

   what other -reasons she might
have had for keeping her identity hid-
den from prince ferdinand i do not
know

   doris armont is of royal blood on
both sides however and her claim to
the fortune and estates of the dead
prince cannot be disputed she is the
sole survivor and lawful heir of the
ancient house of helfonstein so
now you can probably see the drift of
this little affair of the ring

   yes-of course-yes i mur-
mured in a daze while the fact kept
pounding in on my brain in a dull
monotonous iteration  you found
your dream-girl-only to lose her
again

  but my companions low even tones
again recalled me
the house of sorcery



   and then count stalheim laid
bare to my confederate his clever
scheme he was to shadow her night
and day and secure the monogrammed
ring which ferdinand had given the
girls mother over twenty - five years
ago

   years ago the detectives the prince
had hired learned that an old nurse had
been entrusted with the ring by the
mother to give to the girl when she
was old enough to understand the
nurse died very suddenly but it was
reasonable to suppose that she had
given the child the ring before she died

   as the girl had not come forward
and established her identity or com-
municated with her father in any way
it was also reasonable to suppose that
the nurse had not been able to tell her
the secret of the ring before her sud-
den death these facts count stal-
heim ascertained from his spies in the
princes household

   so it was really simple after all
my partner was to secure the ring and
then he was to pose as the half-brother
george armont and i was selected to
impersonate the missing heiress doris
armont

   he shadowed the girl to new
york and traced her to a house not
far from here on madison avenue

   now it so happens that my con-
federate was familiar with all the de-
tails of prince ferdinands strange
death as he was in the vicinity of the
castle at the time there he talked to
several old inhabitants of the near-by
village who remembered this odd
misshapen creature when he had lived
there as a youth with his mother and
what was his astonishment on shadow-
ing this house in which the girl lived
to see her emerge from it one after-
noon two days ago with the deformed
man -- the murderer of her own
father 

  i gasped my simulated amazement
as best i could of course it was no
news to me-but my informer could
not appreciate that fact

   yes-no other continued the girl

before me enjoying the shock she
thought she had administered to me

   my partner had heard each detail
of this malformed creatures descrip-
tion so often from the villagers that
he knew no other creature could pos-
sibly resemble him and this fellow
had that peculiar wabbling jaw laugh-
ing at which caused the princes tragic
death years later

   well we puzzled over this remark-
able coincidence for many solid hours
and could not make head nor tail of
it but time was precious so my con-
federate resolved on a desperate chance

   he visited this man in his home a
few hours ago-to be exact about nine
oclock he told him bluntly that he
knew who he was and that if he did
not secure the ring from the girl and
turn it over he would communicate
with the german authorities and have
him extradited he was living there
under the name of max leidner-an
assumed name

   the plan worked even better than
we had dreamed possible leidner as
he now calls himself left the room
and after a while returned with the
ring he evidently was unaware of
who the girl really was and seemed
to know nothing at all about the article
we wanted

   what mysterious hold he has over
doris armont-whom my confederate
says is the most beautiful woman he
ever saw-is something which i can-
not explain but we do not have to
bother ourselves with that - it is an
outside matter to us

   of course i agreed now having
recovered somewhat of my wonted
composure but my companion did
not know that it was anything but an
 outside matter  to me

  doris armont-my fiancee-was of
royal blood and the only living survivor
of the house of helfonstein yes i
had found her-only to lose her again
but i was forgetting my surroundings
i recalled myself with a start as the
girl replaced her glass on the table after
sipping it meditatively


the all-story magazine

   and so he turned over the ring 
i queried

   yes and by the questions leidner
asked we know that he is entirely ig-
norant of its history very few peo-
ple even in the princes immediate
household knew of its existence so it
is therefore not strange that he also is
in the dark

   and the fact that he could induce
the girl to part with it so readily bears
out our conviction that she also is
ignorant of its significance

   so you see our work was not as
hard as we anticipated all we had to
guard against were two men who for
years had been employed in the service
of count stalheim and who had exe-
cuted several transactions for him in
conjunction with my partner in ger-
many at different times

   they became dissatified these two
and the count had reliable information
that they had followed my partner to
new york and were going to try to
get a hand in this game of the ring if
possible i dont know whether you
knew it before-but those men are your
friends cutler and warnham

  no i did not know i answered
truthfully for once  i told you i
knew nothing about this matter i
worked with cutler years ago on a
certain deal in new york i ran into
him accidentally only yesterday morn-
ing and he arranged with me to go
after this ring what do they want
with it do you suppose  

  my curiosity was genuine i was
mighty anxious to know what mr
gimlet-eyes-their employer-wanted
avith that ring

   oh merely a case of blackmail
she responded readily  with the
ring in their possession they can sell
it to count stalheim at an enormous
figure

   i see i said-and yet i felt that
she avas away off the true scent

  it did not strike me that the pos-
sessor of those search-light eyes-
honest-appearing eyes-avas merely in
a petty little blackmailing scheme his

shrewd brain avas after bigger fish than
that

   but avhat about the tin box i
stole   i queried avith an interest i
could barely conceal

   that she enlightened  is arery
important to messrs cutler and warn-
ham your confederates it contains
all the correspondence george armont
has had with count stalheim concern-
ing this ring

   if your friends get hold of that
they can blackmail the count for any
sum they choose to name such proof
of the part he plays in the affair avouici
if published ruin him completely-
drive him from germany in fact

   urn-i see i said  and i
tlxmght they avere paying me avell for
my avork noav i can appreciate what
a rotten deal they avere giving me-and
i did all the big avork too

   but avhat has all this to do with
the proposition you spoke of making-
me-living a lie for the rest of my
life  i queried taking the bottle from
its bed of ice and filling our glasses
again

  she avas lighting another cigarette

   my proposition is simple she re-
plied after a few meditative puffs
 you avill impersonate george ar-
mont the half-brother of doris ar-
mont

   but i thought your confederate had
that job i propounded taken com-
pletely by surprise

   do you remember what you said
before i commenced my story she
asked  you remarked that there
avas no sentiment in this matter avith
you-purely business

   um-i see meaning likeavise that
there is no sentiment in this matter
avith you 

   exactly it suits my purpose to
have you as a half-brother avith avhom
to enjoy the princely fortune the es-
tates and castles avhich my poor mur-
dered father prince ferdinand has
left me

  she avas smiling avhimsically at me
behind a blue wreath of smoke -
the house of sorcery



   is it not worth living a lie the rest
of your life-for this 

   it is i responded promptly

  you are with me then she
breathed throwing her cigarette on a
plate and leaning far forward across
the table her olive skin flushed her
eyes hashing

   i am  said and gave her my
hand upon it

   i knew you would  she cried
laughing almost hysterically  thats
why i took a chance and let you in on
the whole story i knew a princely
game such as this would appeal to
you

   but how are you going to side-
track your partner i queried inter-
estedly

   you and i have the ring and the
tin box havent we thats all that is
necessary-the ring will establish our
identity and prince stalheim will be
perfectly willing to let you play the
game

   you are a born actor and you can
carry the part better than my present
partner ive been afraid hed trip up
sooner or later hes all right in his
line but this is a little bit over his
head

   very nice i assented  but lies
not going to be side-tracked without
making considerable noise

  she smiled a very cunning light in
her changeable eyes as she slowly
sipped at her glass placing it on the
table she leaned toward me and spoke
in a low voice 

   a word from me to kronholtz-
who is count stalheims confidential
aid-and my old partner will-ahem
-meet with a very sudden unexpected
-er-end

   kronholtz has several men with
him who are adepts in getting unde-
sirable people out of the way--perma-
nently that fellow you saw with me
in the writing-room is one of them
yes it has got to be it is the only way
of course we could never be safe with
him possessing our secret-you realize
that

    	s

  she was still smiling into my eyes-
confidentially frankly as if she had
proposed some harmless little trick to
play on an acquaintance

   yes-of course-certainly i re-
joined  it is the only way

   very well that is settled she
said as if dismissing a trivial detail
from her mind  im glad now that
you appeared on the scene and stole the
tin box and the ring it has given me
a half-brother who will play the game
artisticallyas it ought to be played
again she smiled at me this time
admiringfy

   but what about cutler and wam-
hani even though they havent got
the evidence the tin box contains it
strikes me they can make things
mussy

   oh she enlightened  kron-
holtzs men will attend to them too
never fear kronholtz is a clever
genius pie will look after every-
thing

   and where does count stalheim
come in on this thing 

   he gets a third-you and i the
other two-thirds oh there is enough
for the three of us i assure you

    very well is that all there is to
it 

    yes excepting that i will have to
arrange a meeting for you with kron-
holtz in the morning we must not
lose any time now the sooner we get
to germany the sooner our reward

   oh-by the way i said  what
about the real doris armont and her
half-brother if they go wandering
about europe on another trip some day
theyre apt to stumble into the thing
at last then aved be in a pretty
pickle

  sh looked at me almost reproach-
fully

    didnt t tell you kronholtz avould
look after everything theyll be
swallowed up-disappear-just like
the others

    oh i said aveakly but she mere-
ly took it as an expression of my un-
derstanding of the little affair

               ujere where i sit alone is sometimes heard

                   from the great world a whisper of my name
               joined haply to some kind commending word

                 by those whose praise is fame

               and then as if i thought thou still were nigh

                 i turned me half forgetting thou art dead

               to read the gentle gladness in thine eye
                 that once  might have read

               i turn but see thee not before my eyes
                the image of a hillside mound appears

                where all of thee that passed not to the skies
                 was laid with bitter tears

               and i whose thoughts go back to happier days
               that fled with thee would gladly now resign
               all that the world can give of fame and praise
               for one sweet look of thine

thus ever when i read of generous deeds-

                such words as thou didst once delight to hear-
               my heart is wrung with anguish as it bleeds
               to think thou art not near

               and now that i can talk no more with thee

                 of ancient -friends and days too fair to last
                a bitterness blends with the memory
                of all that happy past
peter maskin was dead and in
his grave the mill where he
ground corn and more than
corn was silent in the gully of the run
there was no one to lift the shunt-
board and let the water pour down
over the great overshot wheel the
corn that was in the toll-bin grew
musty and sour where it lay heaped

  there was no one so far as the coun-
tryside knew who could claim the mill
and thirty acres of land the bullet
that bored through the heart of old
pete the miller made joy where there
had been suffering and dismay

  it seemed as if the mans bones had
cast their blight like salt across the
mill lot for only rank weeds grew
there except at the entrance to the
mill there was hard bare ground it
was easily believed that the bones did
not rest

  the crowd that came to the mans
funeral was large-not to increase the
mourning but to see with their own
eyes that old pete had not been too
mean to die as some had said if he
had stood up in his coffin and demanded
tolls demanded interest money de-
manded payments there would have

been fear dread horror but no sur-
prise

  the face was no grayer in death than
it had been in life across that counte-
nance had spread the terrible disease of
avarice

  he would have cursed the extrava-
gance that took from his leather pock-
etbook the money for the coffin in which
to inter his own remains a box made
with his own hands from weather-old
fence-boards had been good enough for
his wife he asked no better for him-
self he had denied none more than
he denied himself

  now when the wind blew at night
with old pete in that extravagant box
of his-the box that had made the un-
dertaker and the coroner grin with
triumph-there came loud wails from
the old mill there came low howls
quavering yells bellowings and laugh-
ter it was the laughter that made that
road unpopular at night

  when the screams of the wind whirl-
ing through the mill were loudest one
could see by moonlight pale figures
come pouring out of the door between
slams-figures that danced whirling
over the bare place killing all the things

that might have grown there and then
leaped up over the burdocks and were
gone in a puff

  by day the snakes gathered on that
bare ground in sunny weather and
made trails across the dust of bran and
corn

  it was a brave man who would go
to that old mill and stand in the gloom
looking into the dusty recesses cur-
tained by the wavering cobwebs swung
down from beams and frames

  youths made passing the old mill the
test of their courage they reported
green eyes in the dark of the mill
every one knew that it was old pete
the millers cat but none knew whether
the cat avas alive or dead

  the cat had been old petes avilcl
companion-a lank black hunter that
never grew fat the very rats in the
mill avere lean from dodging the angry
miller ald his no less angry cat a
mad she-cat an old maid that had nea-er
littered kittens helped make the place
untenantable no matter avhether she
avas alive or dead

  there aaras yet the hoarded gold

  it avas gold that had transformed
the pretty green avater maskins run
gully into the terrible mill site that
it had become every one knew the
story of that gold it lured avhile it
repelled

  when peter maskin avas a young
man he was like all the other young men
of the land he skylarked round court-
ed the girls and even spent his money
for moonshine he used to go doavn the
riarer on log rafts and came home on
the train and overland on the stage avith
the long coil of handyline rope over
his shoulder avith the rest of them

  one trip the chattanooga sawmill
paid him off in gold-paid him one hun-
dred dollars in gold for his string of
logs he had neaer seen gold before
if the aaord avas a part of his arocabulary
none remembered ever hearing him use
it if he had eaer hungered for gold
not a man or avoman in all the avorld
kneav it

  noav he stared at the coins the fiare

coins and his companions saav groaving
in his eyes the terrible look avhich avas
never again to leave them-the look that
spread across his countenance and
stretched doavn into his hands and fin-
gers changing them into hooks that al-
avays pulled toward him

  neaer a piece of gold did peter mas-
kin spend he doled out his pennies
and his silrer and eked out his toll of
corn but never did a gold coin slip past
those hooked hands of his if he loaned
money he paid it over in silver and
paper and dreav it back in gold

   pay me back in gold  he avoulcl
demand as he counted out his paper and
his siher ahvays he had paper and
silver

  they paid for his coffin with paper
and silver they paid the coroners fees
the sheriffs fees everybodys fees avith
silver and paper from the dead mans
avallet

  there avas one empty compartment
to that coavhide avallet avhen some one
who was curious held the leather to the
reflection of the sun it gave off the sheen
of gold they could not help but divine
that old pete had neaer let his silver or
his paper touch his gold orgo into the
receptacle of his gold

   where did he put his gold  men
asked one another

  none could ansaver none dared to
seek it

   he took it with im   tradition took
to saying some believed that the ket-
tles in avhich he avas supposed to have
buried it had gone into his grave to
rattle among his bones

  in the depths of their hearts many a
man wished that he could stumble upon
that gold not one had his wish

  the man avho found the gold had
nearer heard of it nor dreamed of haa-
ing gold and it fastened itself to him
like the old man of the sea

  his name avas dolancl colb-a harm-
less man who spent most of his time
playing the fiddle he avould rather
feed his soul avith music thanfeed his
stomach avith food or clothe his body
with avooi
the gold mill



  shiftless good-natured care-free he
had never been drawn taut in all his
born days he shambled through the
mountains playing as he walked along
he would stop and play for a gray
squirrel if the squirrel showed interest
and appreciation he charmed a whole
drove of mules one day foxes came a
long ways behind him doubtful of the
man but charmed by the inspired
strains

  if a man invited him in to a snack
well and good he was worthy of his
hire and he would play a family to sleep
to show his appreciation but if a dog
howled he would take down his strings
and loosen up his bow rather than hurt
even the feelings of a beast

  he bore no hard feelings against any
man in all the world when he came over
the divide and started down the trail of
maskins run

  others called that the lonesomest
trail in all the world but not so doland
colb it inspired him a storm was
just coming on and the far lightnings
bellowed forth low tliunderings which
the fiddler set to music and poured it
back into the full sky a part of the
chorus and the play

  if the sky had its lightning clouds
and thunder the earth had its moun-
tains shadows and doland colb--
ragged shaggy and impassioned pour-
ing out his tunes like a bird

  his eyes were on the belching black
clouds of the sky and he stepped high
to avoid the boulders and cobbles of the
road he was awakened from his rev-
eries by the loud and discordant splash
of a huge rain-drop on his fiddle

  the splash stretched a string and he
looked about him in haste and dazed
surprise trying to place himself won-
dering how he had come to be in such a
place without shelter at such a time
heretofore it had been a picture but
now he saw the gray sheeting rain com-
ing and to save his precious strings he
must find shelter

  ahead of him loomed a mill gray
and solemn with the water pouring out
round the shunt-board and falling down

in spray wasted on all but an eye for
neglect and beauty and fallow scenes
he swung into the old mill and sat
down just inside the doorway to wait
while the storm should drive by

  if his fiddle-strings had not been
dampened by that one drop t that
splashed on the instrument he would
have played on as it was he could
only look at the rain then growing
restless he began to look round him in
the mill

  he saw what all the others had seen
-cobwebs dust musty toll-bin and
wheels and burrs that did not turn he
walked round and climbed up-stairs to
look where the corn was shoveled into
the hopper and he gingerly brushed
away the dust that was on webs across
the little window there trying to let
in light in order to see better

  he knew the mountain mills had lis-
tened while they turned over and over
-- calink-calank-calunk  - and in
the silence of this mill his mind revert-
ed to those other mills he remembered
that each mill had its own sound-the
undershot the overshot the turbine

  there in the quiet of this mill he
could feel the music held in the planks
beams and stones of allmiills he could
hear the spirit of the mill singing as
he looked at the unground corn sprout-
ing there and as he thought of the
green toll-bin something of the calam-
ity of the mill that was dead stirred in
his soul

  his breath began to come in short
gasps thinking of what was unplayed
-what no man had ever yet played
he listened and amid the uproar of
the storm while the loose planks rat-
tled and the wind drew screaming
through the whistling places he caught
the rhythm of the old mill and he knew
that after a time he would play it on
the fiddle and make it into music that
would cheer him on his way

  listening he heard a chinking
sound followed by another and an-
other he looked around puzzled and
doubtful he could not tell whether
it was up-stairs or down


the all-story magazine

  when he stepped he heard a rippling
of chinking he stamped and there
was a splashing of metal somewhere
he looked down the steep stairs on
which his tracks were printed in the
dust as if he had stepped on snow

  on the floor beside his fiddle was a
piece of gold round and dull but un-
mistakable

  he stared at it curiously wonder-
ing not quite comprehending at first
for when one has been a wandering
minstrel during many many years the
heart does not at first bound with ex-
ultant greed when one sights the shift
of wind that changes his fortune

  oh doland colb said half
aloud  that was the strange note
that i heard  

  then he descended making his foot-
prints in the dust upon each step that
he had climbed when he was down-
stairs he saw what had happened his
weight on the floor above had shaken
the beams and timbers and one sup-
porting beam beside the burrs had
sprung under the weight and from its
hollow heart had fallen a cascade of
old gold which pete the miller had ac-
cumulated in the years of his grasping
and hungering and greed

  the fiddler did not stoop at once to
pick it up lie was thinking of the
sound that it had made and he did not
want to forget that

  then he picked up the coin that he
had seen first where it had rolled
through the dust leaving a sharp black
trail to its resting place beside the old
fiddle it was a contrast - that
scarred fiddle and the piece of dull
gold

  colb picked it up he picked up the
other coins and put them in his pocket
then he pulled out the wooden plugs
which had served as a ladder up the
beam from which the miller could
reach the chute and the hopper of the
mill each plug was driven into a
two - inch auger hole in each hole
were pieces of gold one of the plugs
had shaken loose and the coins had
tumbled out

  the fiddlers pockets would not hold
it all they would have torn out if they
had held it all there were eight hun-
dred double eagles or fifty pounds
troy the fiddler looked about him
trying to find something trying to
think of something in which to carry
that dead weight of sixteen thousand
dollars net

  he was glad that the storm was last-
ing as long as it did he wanted no
company there at such a time

  as he gazed about his thoughts
quickened and his eyes gained in
sharpness his frame stiffened from
a thousand directions came pouring
the avalanche of hopes deferred of
longings ungratified of inspirations
never voiced he took out the coin he
had first seen and held it in his hand
to compare it with his weather-beaten
wet-stringed fiddle it was a contrast
that he would never forget as long as
he should live

  there was some heavy canvas on
the mouth of the chute to guide the
corn down into the hopper and also to
prevent the corn from overrunning
the brim of the hopper this can-
vas at last struck the eye of the man
and he pulled it down-a strip sixteen
inches wide and three feet long

  it would lap itself round his slim
waist and he drew from under his
coat a long needle and a black thread
the inevitable kit of a wandering min-
strel and of those who travel to forget
with this needle and thread he made
himself a canvas money-belt whose
compartments he loaded with gold

  he swung it round his waist and
over his shoulders he led strips of
canvas to support the weight when
this was done he picked up the pegs
and drove them into the holes in the
upright timber again

  when he was all through a slim
black cat came purring up out of a
hole in the corner and brushed round
him her eyes shining green in the dark
of the mill

  the storm had ceased its downpour
but overhead the black clouds milled
the gold mill



and made ready to break away doland
colb after a look at the weather
picked up his fiddle and his bow and
stepped out on the hard-pan before the
mill doorway

  there was weight to his step and
swagger to his swing he saw with
not quite clear understanding that the
world looked different than he had
ever before seen it

  he strode away down the run and
as the string of his fiddle had dried
out by this time he turned up the
bridge and set up the keys he tight-
ened the hair of the bow and with a
flourish began to play-and he played
as he had never played before

  hardly had lie begun however
when there was an interruption

  down from the milling clouds shot
a bolt of lightning shivering and
splitting the air it struck the mill
fairly and out of the broken windows
and the doors burst clouds of dust fol-
lowed by darts and whirls of flame in
a half minute while the fiddler stared
the dust turned to black smoke and
when a sharp gust of wind swept up
the run it threw back the smoke long
enough to give him sight of a black
cat standing with arched back on the
peak of the mills roof surrounded by
puffs of white steam spurting up
through the split wet shingles

  then the fire rolled up

  doland colb laughed while he shud-
dered the laugh was for the music
that he had in mind the shudder was
for the cat which a minute before had
been so friendly

   i better play that piece before i
forget hit  he said to himself giving
another flourish to his bow to limber
up his arm and shake his coat-sleeve
clear

  as he strode along playing he
passed a cabin down in the valley at
the foot of the run he heard a man
remark

   sho that fellers jes a cuttin
hit down aint he  

  yassuh another answered and
then shouted to the fiddler  hey
you low ill gin ye a nights lodgin
fer some o that music 

  the fiddler glanced at him with con-
siderable scorn and strode  -- play-
ing as he had never played before
neither the mud nor the hunger that
was coming on checked the exuberance
of his spirits

  he cared nothing now many prob-
lems had been solved he was on his
way to town-to rogersville the
nearest one

  he fiddled till he struck the side-
walk when he ceased and stalked with
dignity till he came to the brick hotel
where sat the proprietor at his ease

  hello dole the proprietor
hailed just in time were goin
to have a dance yere to-night got
somethin new fer us  

  nope doland grinned im
stoppin to the marble hall to-night
 what

  the fiddler scorned the surprise and
sauntered on to the big hotel where
they played orchestras

  there he tossed a double eagle on
the cigar-case and demanded a smoke
this he followed with a call for a
room and then he was shown to the
dining-room

   i kin remember when that feller
used to play up the street for his
nights lodging the proprietor re-
marked turning the coin over in his
hands fondly now look at im
beats all dont it

tiie fugitives set saie

staring drowsily at the float
platform ralph saw no one

he felt a bit of wood tap
him on the head and looked up to see
a man standing over him on the roof
of the car the man held a brake-
mans stick in his hand

    all right all right ralph said
wearily  no violence please

  he was prepared to meet any fate
if only he could be released from the
ladder

  it was harry dunn who stood on
top of the car from which he descend-

bcean october all-story magazine



 ed immediately to join his chum drake
 on the platform

    say harry drake said holding
 up a lantern and scowling at ralph
 withingtons blackened spray-streaked
 face  ill bet hes thrown the kid
 overboard

   on the instant sigismund leaped
from the folds of ralphs overcoat
nimble as a fairy

  the two trainmen sprang back a
few paces in surprise

    oh mister sigismund cried
 we didnt mean anything honest
we didnt we got  the wrong boat
by mistake but we have money and
will pay our fare

          single copiei  centi
nothing but the truth



  for the first time since they had
been drenched at the battery ralph
withington was conscious of warmth
within him it was caused by his ad-
miration for sigismunds quick wit
and unperturbed manner

  is this man your father harry
dunn asked gruffly

   you didnt think he was my brud-
der did youse  sigismund asked by
way of reply and in consummate imi-
tation of a tough boys voice

   how could he lie if he wanted to
ralph was thinking when he heard a
question suddenly addressed to him

   whered you meet this kid
harry dunn asked

  for a second ralph was nonplused
then he responded solemnly recalling
the eyrie building

   we didnt meet sir we collided
and thats the truth

   dont try to pull any of that gay
stuff harry dunn snarled and grab-
bing his chums arm drew him aside to
confer privately

   say arent you ever going to try
to reform sigismund asked ralph
 why didnt you tell him something
hed believe 

   but didnt we collide sigismund
 theres no use to talk to you
sigismund declared despondently
 wait here till i find out what these
fellows are going to do with us
straightway sigismund skipped like
a little boy over to the spot where the
two trainmen stood in close talk

  alone a lean somber figure black
in the distance remained ralph he
was sodden chilled and mushy with a
combination of damp potato and coal-
dust his face was smudged black as
the night itself

   please misters sigismund piped
in childish treble to the trainmen you
wont do nothing to popper an me
will youse  

  it was sigismunds calculation that
if he could win tiie sympathy of the
men posing as ralphs boy they would
be satisfied with a couple of dollars
each and permit ralph and himself to

depart unmolested when the float made
dock

  both men looked down pityingly at

	the little fellow

    pie aint your popper kid said
harry dunn patting sigismunds
shoulder  hes just telling you lies
 pie is so my popper and he never
lies sigismund wailed in feigned
crying  pie doesnt know how
harry turned to his chum saying
 jim you aint married and so you
dont understand kids let me man-
age him

    all right jim grunted standing
by with the lantern

   now harry dunn spoke very
coaxingly  you just tell me the truth
and ill see no harm conies to you
sigismund sniffed and sobbed

    dont be scared kid youre with
the right bunch so spit it out

   even quick-witted sigismund needed
time to think in such an emergency

   me mudder ran away he wailed
 an the landlord shut up the flat
and i was playin hookey from school
and-

  what did i tell youse harry
dunn asked turning to his chum  its
the same story i seen in the papers
the kids mother ran away to her

the all-story magazine

  harry dunns breast swelled with
pride he couid see his picture in the
next days papers and a picture of the
thousand-dollar check which he and
jim would receive as reward

   youre married jim remarked
not distrustfully its hard to be dis-
trustful when half of a thousand dol-
lars may be yours for merely looking
wise  i guess you know more than
me about children

   run right back kid to the big
fellow said harry dunn urging sig-
ismund gently away  we reach our
dock in a little while jim and me will
take care of you

  when sigismund had reached the
particularly dark region that ralph
withingtons presence seemed only to
make darker ralph saluted him with
 of course you made it all right
didnt you they understood when
you explained didnt they  how much
shall i offer them  

   oh its all right sigismund an-
swered with mock cheer in his voice
 we can stretch here and rest if we
like they promised to take care of
us until we reach the dock

  what a marvel you are ralph
exclaimed  you lied to them i sup-
pose

   you lie down sigismund re-
turned  and rest yourself for a while
when we get to mott haven those
trainmen who think we are dagos and
you kidnaped me are going to hand
me and you over to the police for a
thousand dollars reward ive heard
the penalty is anywhere up to twenty
years sigismund concluded wearily
what have you gone and done
 i overplayed my part said sigis-
mund  i thought the kid act would
fetch them and it did it brought
them right down on top of us lets
stretch i feel six feet tall and theres
an ache in every inch

   nevertheless ralph persisted
 you and i know that we are not da-
gos we can prove its not true that
i kidnaped you all we have to do is
to tell the police-

  yes sigismund interrupted go
to the station house and get our names
in print as supposed kidnaper and kid-
napee when the fact is that we are
only trying to disappear from a miss
myrtilla ashe and a few other people
now let me rest and think gee but
im a fine actor 

  pins and needles ralph groaned
and clapped his hands together making
a noise like a shot  perhaps if i had
talked with the men-

   you would be better off of
course you would have told them
the truth and then whered we be  
sigismund demanded sitting up

   no ralph answered solemnly i
would have lied but i would not have
dared such a big fake as you did i
would-

   not what you would but what you
are going to do cant you suggest
anvthing- 

  all ralph said was  and i ex-
pected to be on our way to the far
west by this time to-night

chapter viii

at the hotel di rocca

  it had been decided between the
trainmen on the float that harry dunn
because  he was married and under-
stood children should take the kid-
naper and the little dago in charge

  only thus were they sure of getting
their captives away and to the police
without having the other members of
the crew in their secret and in the re-
ward

   harry be careful of the big
bloke jim cautioned

   i got me stick an can lay him flat
in one whiff if i want to harry re-
plied confidently  the thousand for
us jim you wait an see 

   them dagos always has knives
look out he dont get behind and sting
you one were jim drakes final
words

   you got a knife i know said
harry dunn gruffly when he had
nothing but the truth



 made ralph and sigismund get up
 from the platform and take their
 hiding-place on the ladder of a car

   he was standing on the roof look-
 ing down at them and holding his club
 within half a foot of ralphs be-
 grimed and bewildered face

    but if youse try to use that
 knife- harry went on  see this
 stick  - he flourished it wickedly -
  its made of iron wood an i got a
 gun handy in me pocket here

    please dont shoot my popper 
 sigismund bawled like a veritable four-
 year-old

   from which remark it is apparent
 that he and ralph had come to the
 conclusion their best alternative was
 to play out the parts of kidnaper and
 kidnapee to the bitter end

     i wont hurt you kid said harry
 dunn tenderly  i got kids of me
 own

   the cars were presently pulled off
 the float into the yards after moving
 slowly and lumberingly this way and
 that for upward of fifteen minutes
 they came to a dead stop

    this is our station harry dunn
 called down to them  you big hiker

 you hold the kid and get off without
 hurtin him or youll be sorry for it 
 ralph obeyed orders under the
 watchful eye of harry dunn set sig-
 ismund on his feet and immediately
 the three found their way across
 tracks and between stalled cars under
 the guidance of the trainman

   plarry dunn kept the big man walk-
 ing about one and a half paces in front
 of him he held sigismund with his
 left hand and in his right kept his
 club ready to fell ralph at the first
 sign of resistance

   to relieve the monotony of their
 amble through the dark he indulged in
 occasional husky remarks of this tenor
 you dirty dago you his club
 r would be gripped tighter try a
 knife on me and ill open your nut
 with this toothpick of mine 

    can i help it if my mother and
 father were italian was the only

repl ralph offered to harry dunns
fiercest threats

   thats the nearest to a common-
sense lie ive yet heard from ralph
thought sigismund hopefully and con-
tinued his wailing plea that he did not
 want his popper hurted

  they came to the outskirts of the
yards where they climbed a steep
gravelly slope from which they were
to enter on to the street at the top

   dont cry kid harry dunn mut-
tered soothingly well soon be in
the street now an were going to have
a nice ride in a trolley-car

   is popper coinin with us  sigis-
mund asked

  before the trainman could say a
word somehow sigismund slipped or
stumbled and losing hold of harry
dunns hand went down on his face
with a childlike yell of terror and pain

   ah youse aint hurt  said the
trainman stooping quickly to recover
his charge

  sigismunds yell was ralphs signal
he whirled about and with his square-
toed number twelve shoe dealt harry
dunn a terrific kick in the pit of the
stomach

  the trainmans hands went up into
the air his club flew beyond them and
he with a bellow that almost immedi-
ately dwindled into a groan doubled
in two and rolled down the slope like
a ball

  meanwhile ralph had caught sigis-
mund up in his arms and ran up to the
street

   i told you ralph you could do it
with that foot the lilliputian ob-
served with a cackling laugh as ralph
set him down on the far side of the
iron fence that railed off the freight-
yards

   we must find a cheap hotel some-
where ralph said as they came with-
in the light of a store-window  if
i look as dirty as you do pm sure they
wont let us on a car

   you dont look any dirtier sig-
ismund returned surveying ralph
 but theres so much more of you than
s

the all-story magazine

there is of me for dirt to stick to be-
sides im dead tired and that hungry
i could eat raw horse

  with frequent glances behind them
to make sure they were not being fol-
lowed the big man and the lilliputian
walked for fully half an hour in the
bronx which was an uncharted sea to
them

  at length they paused before a long
two-story frame building in which all
the ground-iloor windows were light-
ed on a dingy electric sign they read 

hotel di rocca
g salvatore prop

  if either of them had known the
bronx as well as each knew manhattan
island he would have realized that they
had been walking in a jagged circle all
this time so that they brought up in the
very neighborhood from which they be-
lieved themselves far removed

  the hotel di rocca had once been a
family house to which a store-front and
extra windows had been added ralph
and sigismund entered what had for-
merly been the house-door but was now
called the hotel-entrance sigismund
waited in the vestibule while ralph
opened a door at the left that gave ad-
mission to the most popular section of
g salvatores establishment

  not above half a minute had sigis-
mund been alone when a short thick-
set italian slipped suspiciously into the
vestibule and laying his hand on sigis-
munds handkerchiefed head whis-
pered a few words in his native tongue

  the little fellow spoke german
french swedish and english in fct
he could make a fist at the language of
any country in which he had toured
but as he had never played in italy he
was obliged to say to the stranger 

   i dont speak italian

  the stranger put a finger to one nos-
tril smiled and was gone

  meanwhile ralph was standing in a
room where through a dense haze of
throttling tobacco smoke he saw a large
crowd of laboring men playing cards at
various small tables from the boiling

excitement of their manner and speech
he realized that they were italians to
a man

   wheres the proprietor  ralph in-
quired in a fairly loud voice

   me signoreannounced a stoutish
happy-faced individual with an enor-
mous mustache and an equally enor-
mous watch-chain

  questioningly he considered the tall
coal-smudged water-logged person who
studied him from great gloomy eyes

   weve been in an automobile col-
lision ralph explained bruskly bra-
cing his shoulders as he had seen sigis-
mund do when addressing any one
 we ran into ten tons of wet coal had
our choice to be drowned or smothered
our car is going to be taken away for
junk to-morrow our clothes are ruined
but no one fortunately hurt or killed

   where dissa happen   g salva-
tore inquired

   oh back a few blocks on the ave-
nue ralph answered he pulled his
wallet from his pocket and handed three
single bills to the proprietor  were
in a hurry to get home but want to
clean up and have some supper first if
that doesnt cover the charges let me
know

   gee sigismund thought eaves-
dropping at the crack of the door be-
tween the hall and the bar  if he isnt
beginning to know how to lie at last
hell be a wonder with some practise

  the rates of the hotel di rocca were
twenty-five cents a night for the cheap-
est room and fifty for the best the house
afforded g salvatore grabbed the
three dollar bills and examined them
quickly

  come signorehe said then i
show room

  as he laid eyes on sigismund in the
hall he caught him up in his arms and
babbled to him in italian that he was
a brave little boy not to cry or be fright-
ened for being in an automobile wreck

   whatta you like for sup  g sal-
vatore asked about to retire from his
guests room  biffastek spaghett
coffee  
nothing but the truth



  ralph informed him that such a sup-
per would be satisfactory and the soon-
er the better

  down to the kitchen went g salva-
tore where his wife sat in her chair by
the stove asleep over her stocking-
basket leaning over her g salvatore
kissed his spouse softly she only mut-
tered a prayer in her sleep but when
he brushed his enormous spokes of mus-
tache across her nostrils she woke with
a loud sneeze

   what a fool you are-

   get busy he answered her in their
own language and pressed the three
dollars into her hand  richa million-
aire and boy up-stairs automobile
smash wanta da sup

  one hour later when supper had been
served and eaten and ralph had in-
formed g salvatore that he would
spend the night there a great and dis-
turbing noise of peoples voices was
heard outside the hotel di rocca

  the card-players forgot all about
their game and stood up wondering and
cautious g salvatore made a rush for
the street door his was a respectable
place and he wanted no fighting or
rowing outside the building

  as he put his hand to the knob the
door was pushed open from the street-
side and a trimly built hard-faced po-
liceman stalked in

  he shut the door behind him and
brushed g salvatore to the left of him
saying loudly and with authority in
italian first and then in english

   everybody stay right in their seat
and they wont be any trouble play
cards  he added as they watched him
open-mouthed

  then g salvatores patrons dropped
onto their chairs and pretended to be
interested in their cards

  the policeman tapped three times
sharply on the door at his back

  again the door was opened revealing
to g salvatores nervous inquisitive
eyes a great crowd of men and women
whom three policemen held at bay the
women were shrieking hysterically and
the men rent the air with maledictions

  they were all italians and g salva-
tore knew very well what they were
raving about yet he kept a respectable
place and had nothing to fear sudden-
ly he bethought himself of the big tall 
man and the little boy in the room up-
stairs consternation froze his soul

  for three dollars he had harbored a
kidnaper

  it would ruin his business in the
neighborhood he would lose his
license

  he was just getting ready to tear his
hair out by the roots when the police-
man reminded him of the presence of
an american who had entered in re-
sponse to the club-taps and stood silent-
ly patient but suspicious beside the
officer of the law

  it was harry dunn the trainman
from the float

  acting as interpreter the policeman
informed g salvatore that he was on
the trail of a tall thin dark man a
kidnaper who had with him a very
small boy wearing a handkerchief
round his head the trainman he
went on had captured the kidnaper and
the bov and was taking them to the
station-house when the kidnaper as-
saulted his captor and escaped with the
child

  they had searched every hotel in the
district when an italian called up the
police station and said he saw a big fel-
low and a little boy going into the hotel
di rocca fie was sure he was the kid-
naper for whom a thousand dollars re-
ward was advertised whether the
italian was right or not they must
search the hotel di rocca

   i am an honest man i am an
honest man  cried g salvatore with
a guilty air

  the truth is he had had a faint sus-
picion that there was something queer
about his strange guests but the three
dollars had put it out of his mind

   come up to room  he con-
tinued still reaching all the high notes
of his voice  i will show you i did
not know 

  they went up-stairs on tiptoe the




the all-story magazine

policeman first g salvatore behind
him and harry dunn the trainman
last

   better have your gun ready
harry dunn whispered to the police-
man  them fellers always carry
knives

   shyit up  the officer whispered in
reply

  by instructions of the policeman g
salvatore knocked at the door of room

	sharply

   whos there  came in the hollow
tones of ralph withington

   signore was the reply in pleasant
tone  i am g salvatore of hotel di
rocca i want to seea you

   you cant ive got all my clothes
off  said ralph

   you mus go outa dis hotel righta
way g salvatore thundered  re-
spectable place no taka bums noa
crooks noa kidnap man - noa not
never i am a honest proprietor

   whats come over you   ralph
roared and at the same moment turned
the key and swung the door open

  the policeman burst into the room
first covering ralph with his revolver
harry dunn hid behind the officers
broad frame as did g salvatore who
shut the door

   act right said the policeman in
italian  an you wont get hurt 

   talk english which is the only
language i understand ralph retorted
 and youll find out something if thats
what you came for

  all about the room were hung dirty
damp clothes and ralph in his under-
wear looked two inches above his actual
height

  the bed had been pushed up close to
the robins-egg-blue bureau and sigis-
mund also in his underclothes sat on
the foot of it his feet balanced on an
open drawer

  he was shaving with ralphs safety-
razor before a cross-eyed mirror

   theres the poor kid harry dunn
muttered to the officer  see-hes
given him his razor to play with so he
wouldnt cry

  the sharp ears of sigismund had
caught the trainmans words and he
jumped up on the bureau at once con-
fronting all of them with a little face
creamy with lather

    mr officer he began with dignity
  this trainman here did find us on his
float-well admit that all right-

    whats all that talking and yelling
outside of your hotel if its such a re-
spectable place mr proprietor ralph
interrupted not so much for the pur-
pose of flinging a gibe at g salvatore
as to warn sigismund by a wink to be
on his guard in what he was saying

   thats a mob ready to lynch you
you big bully if they can get their
hands on you for stealing away this-
the trainman was saying when the po-
liceman cut in

  shut up said the officer lets
hear the kids story go ahead kid  

   the trainmans boat is seaworthy
all right sigismund continued  but
we were not out for a ride on the river
like a pair of boys we hopped on the
train and before we could hop off again
found ourselves afloat

   where did your cars come from  
the policeman inquired of the trainman
in an undertone

   from hoboken harry dunn re-
plied surlily he felt the policeman was
not giving him the treatment his im-
portant discovery deserved

    oh thats it is it  the policeman
said with a grunt  keep a movin
kid

   we would have given his pal and
him a couple of dollars each if they had
minded their own business and let us
go pursued sigismund  but this
fellow was sure he was in for a thou-
sand dollars reward for- rescuing a kid-
naped dago and so we had to give him
the slip

  what does lie get b it just to
prove to you mr officer that im no
kid but thirty-four years old and a lilli-
putian actor out of a job you can come
up and feel my beard come on i
wont hurt you and besides youve got
your pistol
nothing but the truth



  the policeman walked over to the
bureau and rubbed his big hand over
sigismunds face

  some whiskers eh for a kid
sigismund asked with a roguish twinkle
in his eye  watch me step

  forthwith sigismund began to sing a
music-hall song in german none of
them understood a word but his pan-
tomime and dancing were so amusing
as he imitated men and women of va-
rious ages attempting the waltz and
other steps that the policeman and g
salvatore laughed till the tears rolled
down their cheeks

  harry dunn the trainman did not
laugh he looked on scowling and mut-
tering sigismund began to act up to-
ward him the sourer harry dunn ap-
peared the funnier sigismund became

  ralph did not dare to laugh remem-
bering his constitutional peculiarity
yet he had never in his life wanted
to laugh so badly he recalled his
visit to professor younglove that morn-
ing and kept saying to himself  i
shall-i will be better for eating loso
peanuts

  but when after piercing the train-
man with every barb of his wit little
sigismund began to improvise a song
beginning  oh mr trainman wont
you lend me a slice of that thou  
neither loso peanuts vita-pull or
vibrational control could hold back
ralph withingtons famous laugh any
longer

  he sat as though doubled in pain
on the edge of the bed and gave out
that junglelike cachinnation and roar
no human being except himself had
ever produced or been able to copy

  in alarm both the trainman and g
salvatore made for the door the
policeman stood his ground and
thought of calling for an ambulance

   its all right mr officer ex-
plained sigismund who had never
heard ralph laugh but had heard him
talk about it  thats what my friend
calls a laugh to himself he added
 and he used to think he didnt know
how to lie  

  the policemans eyes flashed and his
forehead wrinkled as he took out his
memorandum - book and began to
glance through the pages

  then he held the book with one
finger at a marked place and told the
trainman and the hotel proprietor to
go down-stairs and inform everybody
that a mistake had been made these
two men were not the kidnaper and the
child but lie knew who they were
and wanted one of his fellow officers
to slip nil without the crowd seeing
him and come to room 

  g salvatore went off highly elated
and with repeated exclamations about
his respectable place to harry dunn
but the trainman was solemn  and
mute

  i guess ive called you fellows
number all right the policeman said
consulting his memorandum-book from
time to time  your names ralph
withington and you disappeared this
morning with a little fellow-a dwarf
named meislahn the last seen of
you you were on a train of empty
cars in the hoboken yards

   we got a still-alarm about you
this afternoon from headquarters
theres no charge against you but
your friends are worried ive a good
description of both of you here but i
couldnt recognize you in your under-
clothes very well could i 

   the report says too the big man
has a laugh like a singing hyena and
it shakes the window-panes you may
as well admit pm right the both of
you because i have the goods on you

  ralph gazed straight through the
officers thick frame and mumbled
something about being betrayed by a
laugh

   all right all right sigismund
announced cheerily but if theres no
charge against us why not let us tend
to our own business and go to sleep
pm tired

   theres no charge exactly the
policeman replied  but you are spe-
cially wanted in connection with an-
other disappearance its a woman


the all-story magazine

and we people believe you know where
she is to be found

 a woman what woman
ralph cried

   sarah mccreevy the officer an-
swered  she disappeared a little
while after you did now own up
and tell me what you know its the
best way

   this is the first we know about
it ralph declared solemnly  i
didnt mean any more to tell the truth
every chance i got but i cant lie about
sarah poor sarah if shed only
waited i was going to write to her
to-night

chapter ix

on many trails

  in view of mrs baxters vindictive-
ness on the telephone toward pro-
fessor younglove when he called her
house up from the hoboken station
and of her dark hints about what ezra
mccreevy and - the butcher herman
swartz would do if they  could get
hold  of him the professors self-
confidence and intrepidity in going
straightway to confront these gentle-
men was nothing less than admirable

  even myrtilla ashe who had re-
mained on the secaucus to return to
hoboken and who found younglove
in the ferry-house waiting for a
twenty-third street boat urged cau-
tion and deliberate action

   how can one tell what a vulgar
rich person like that womans uncle
might or might not do   myrtilla
asked as she and the professor went
aboard together  he blames you
for her disappearance when you had
nothing to do with it and it would be
just his vulgar way to try to ruin your
health circle for mere spite

   a good soldier younglove
argued  always faces the enemy i
want you to go right over to the office
and stay till i see you or call you

  llve been trying for years to get
into close touch with a man worth a

lot of money and now that i have
learned that ezra mccreevy is worth
forty to fifty thousand dollars im
not going to lose the chance of meeting
him even if it is his present intention
to throw me out of the house

   you said he was old she re-
joined  and i did not fear any physi-
cal harm he might do to you

   so you wouldnt want to see me
hurt not in any little way myrtilla 
younglove queried

  it was the second time he had called
her by her first name to do so fell
quite naturally to him he felt as it
did to lay his hand on her wrist and
fix his blue eyes on hers with a con-
centration he never devoted to any of
his patients

   i count on you to help me recover
walter-i mean mr raleigh myr-
tilla replied lowering her lids and
withdrawing her hand for the neces-
sary purpose of smoothing her veil

  i shall i will succeed young-
love declared uttering his most popu-
lar health and success formula the
while he played his finger-tips against
one another

  in just what he meant to succeed
he did not mention to myrtilla but
lapsed into one of his moods of con-
centration his gaze wandering far
away upon the river

  myrtilla understood that he did not
wish to be disturbed in such moments
and was silent moreover she was
turning over in her mind all he had
told her about his hunt for walter as
she called him and the lilliputian

  younglove did not speak again until
they were leaving the boat on the new
york side

   i do not object to telling you just
for yourself myrtilla he said roll-
ing her name like candy on his tongue
 that i have a firm hope miss mc-
creevy will communicate with us at
the office

   i must confess professor myr-
tilla replied  that i really have no
interest in that person in fact if it
were not for your training of me jn
             nothing but
             

 the health circle i should say i hate
 her and consider her an impudent
 loud-mouthed piece of furniture

    but you will be loyal to me will
 you not myrtilla  

    of course of course as i must be
 to myself  but i must watch my vibra-
 tions whenever that person is men-
 tioned

   younglove had been preparing to
confide to myrtilla that as it had been
his suggestion to miss mccreevy she
would do well to be among the missing
when her uncle and his butcher eligible
appeared there could be small doubt
but that sarah would keep the health
circle discreetly advised of her where-
abouts

   he said no more about miss mc-
creevy therefore and helping myrtilla
on to a cross-town car walked the
short distance eastward to mrs bax-
ters house

   mrs baxter herself admitted him
 lean and fidgety she was all atremble
 if her two tiny dots of black eyes
 had been stilettos he would have been
 pierced from front to back

    i am professor younglove he
announced nevertheless in his suavest
manner are you mrs baxter

    i am she answered curtly slam-
 ming the door  step into the par-
 lor

   unperturbed younglove placed his
 hat and overcoat on the rack in the
 hall and with a bow indicated that
 she was to precede him into the parlor

   as younglove entered after her he
 made a mental note that the air of the
 long old-fashioned room was bristling
 with inimical vibrations

   it required a few seconds for his
 eyes to become accustomed to the
 light yet he stood with his back to the
 windows balancing almost unnotice-
 ably on heel and toe and playing his
 finger-tips together

    how do yu do and good health
 to all who are here he addressed
 them gravely with authority

    speech  speech  shrilled a voice
 far down in the room

     	s

the truth	

   no not exactly a speech pretty
polly younglove said in his most
beguiling tones to the bird

  on the sofa at the right side of the
room he saw lanky mrs baxter stiff
and prim beside the ponderous and
fat mrs howe opposite them on
chairs sat two men younglove had
no difficulty in distinguishing which
was ezra mccreevy and which mr
swartz the butcher

  not one of these four persons ad-
dressed a word to him

   no speech pretty polly young-
love went on his eyes apparently see-
ing only the parrot  but the word of
success and health to these good
friends of ours here and then-a mo-
ments silence that we may inspire
strength all of us for the business we
have in hand

   no speeches and no silences
either ezra mccreevy broke out in
a high nasal voice  all we want is
to know what youve done with my
niece-do you hear  

  mr mccreevy was a short wizened
slight man with white hair and a yel-
low skin he wore a shepherds-plaid
cutaway suit with straps under the in-
step of his boots to hold down his
trouser legs

   i am honored sir to meet you
mr mccreevy was yomgloves re-
sponse	

  before testy mr mccreevy knew
what the professor was about young-
love was holding his bony hand
murmuring

   vibrations perhaps a trifle jan-
gling to-day it may be the unseason-
able cold weather

  ezra mccreevy looked at the pro-
fessors round sunshiny face trying
to frame an expression of disgust and
ire suitable to the moment but young-
love was now gripping the butchers
big beefy palm

   and you also i am glad to know
mr herman swartz i believe of the
bronx you cater to our merely
physical needs in the way of meats and
groceries as i cater to our universal
	the all-story magazine

needs psychical and physical both of
us deal only in the first quality of
goods and never give short weight

   dots correct the astonished
herman swartz observed  but how
do you know you aint never bought
noddings by me

   your vibrations are full but a
slight heaviness is noticeable mr
swartz nothing to worry about
however and paying no heed to mr
swartzs question younglove turned
with a bow to the two ladies on the
sofa

   dont you touch my hand
snapped mrs baxter putting them
both behind her back  i dont be-
lieve in fortune-tellers nor anything
like that

  ha-ha-ha younglove laughed
cheerily  i am no fortune - teller
mrs baxter i help people to make
their own fortune in health-getting so
they may win success by doing what
they can do best to the best of their
ability and this lady whom i have
not had the pleasure-

  mrs howe said mrs baxter
 she is one of sarah mccreevys
dearest friends

  mrs howe gave a short jerky bow
of the head to younglove and then
turned to stare at mrs baxter to see
whether she was poking fun at her
she and sarah mccreevy could not
bear the sight of each other and mrs
baxter knew it

   votes for women  hannibal the
parrot shrilled  who-eeeee  

   right you are polly younglove
said waving his hand toward the bird

   mrs baxter ezra mccreevy be-
gan irritably  will you please stow
that cussed bird somewheres she
seems to have as much to say as pro-
fessor younglove and its all i can
do to listen to one such talker

   you naughty naughty hannibal
youll be drowned  with which mrs
baxter quickly went over and picking
up the parrot-perch put hannibal in
the back parlor behind closed doors
the statement that she and sarah

mccreevy were the dearest friends had
been rankling in mrs howes ample
bosom it was a nasty underhand
kind of dig to give anyhow she
thought and when mrs baxter re-
turned to the sofa she broke out before
even younglove could say a word

   all i wanted to know profess-
or younglove she told him  was
whether you caught that little rat
meislahn he owes me a whacking
big board bill and i want to have him
arrested for beating a hotel

   i have no- word yet to give you
mrs howe but i have every reason
to believe i shall have news for you
later in the day i have a whole rail-
road company interested in my case
heres one of my cards call me up
at any time and come in to see me
and younglove gave her the card

   sit- right back on the sofa where
you were  ezra mccreevy cried
snappishly  as the dearest friend of
sarah i want you to stay you may
have an idea or be of some help

  mrs howe sank back into her seat
flabbergasted she might hate sarah
but sarahs uncle actually scared vo-
lition out of her and mrs howe had
a will of her own seven days of the-
week

   all dot hand-holding business iss
ofer aind it herman swartz in-
quired of younglove  now i want
to tell you somedings der lady i was
to marry to-day she aind here we
was going to atlantic city to - night

i had it all fixed aind dot right
mgreefy  

  swartz gave a glance at mr mc-
creevy but allowed him no time to
reply

   we was coming back from our
honeymoon on monday morning i
told the boys at the store id be there
at twelve oclock and me and my wife
would settle right down to a sensible
life now what you done did mit my
wife you smart provessor

   but she isnt your wife and you
havent even met miss mccreevy as i
understand said younglove


nothing but the truth



  dot makes noddings out she
would have been if you didnt do her
something so she run away-and she
wrote a queer letter too like one of
der letters der coroner collects swartz
said accusingly

   oh for mercy sake man dont
talk like that mrs baxter whined
from the sofa

   as a matter of absolute logic in-
terposed ezra mccreevy in his most
acid manner  how could mr swartz
marry this woman if she wasnt here
how could he even meet her now
you who call yourself a man of educa-
tion professor answer me that you
say she is not his wife i say how
could she be when she wasnt here
how could he meet her even-

   your logic is without flaw mr
mccreevy younglove replied most
ingratiatingly  but your vibrations
are if i must say it-

   you just leave my vibrations
alone younglove ezra went on
rising- to one of his frenzies  you
have no more to say about my vibra-
tions than you have about my socks
you are responsible for my nieces dis-
appearance what with your treatment
of her and of the man who fooled her
into believing he was going to marry
her you-

   i am responsible my dear mr- 

   no mush for me thanks i know
all about your health institute or circle
sarah told mrs baxter before she ever
went to see you of tle letters she got
from you

   all i said was just what she told
me herself mrs baxter chimed dole-
fully

   now there are two people that  m
going to get by the short hair unless
this thing is settled darned quickly
one is that man withington who
played sarah such a scurvy trick and
who from what mrs baxter said is
a kind of human nuisance on all
counts the other is you why man
ill put you out of business it aint a
legitimate business to my mind in the
first place

   my business as you call it
younglove retorted quietly  is there
for you or anybody to examine its
done open and aboveboard i would
take some notice your threats mr
mccreevy if it were not that your vi-
brations are in such a state of dis-
order-

   drat you man just keep off my
vibrations  ezra squeaked much as
if younglove had stamped on his foot
 all i got to say is that ive sent out
a still alarm through the police for this
withington fellow and for sarah and
if i find you and your vibrations are
up to any monkey business ill-
ill-

   wass ist den dis here fibrating
business herman swartz interrupt-
ed pulling his blond mustache with
both hands at once and then folding his
hands complacently on his well - indi-
cated abdomen as though he dared
younglove to explain  i been in
groceries and meat aboud forty years
and nobody aind never yet try to sell
me any such goods iss the pure
food act on it  

   hold your tongue herman ezra
snarled

  mr swartzs red face went purple
with rage but he did as ordered

  it was not in herman to offend a
rich customer especially when he ex-
pected to join the family time enough
then

   theres something besides gro-
ceries and meat in this microcosm of
ours younglove flung at the heavy
red - faced prosperous grocer with
gentle irony

   now vots dot again micro-
something swartz cut in venting the
anger ezra had roused on younglove
 anypotty should know you fellers is
skins the kind of langwitch you chuck
in a mans face

   im willing to answer all questions
whoever asks them the professor
stated slowly  but i cant talk to more
than one of you at the time now im
talking to mr mccreevy ill take you
next in turn herman swartz and


the all-story magazine

whatever groceries or meats you have
to offer

  the door-bell rang

   youll have to excuse me mrs
baxter announced jumping up  its
the girls afternoon off and i have to
answer the bell

   maybe its some word from the
police suggested mrs howe

  the idea imposed silence on the
others assembled in the room young-
love took advantage of the first mo-
ment of liberty he had since entering
the parlor to find a chair for himself
and sit down

  in walked mrs baxter presently
followed by a well-built quick-eyed
boy who showed a lustrous red pom-
padour as he snatched off his hat

   why algernon   younglove ex-
claimed and turning to the others
added this is algernon my office-
boy in fact the perfect office-boy

   how do you do good health
said algernon to the company and
then handed a sealed letter to his em-
ployer

   may i be excused   younglove
said and tore open the envelope

  the two men and two women were
all eyes  younglove as he read the en-
closure algernon stood bv his hat in
his hand and his eyes riveted  the
tips of his shoes

  there were really two enclosures
one sheet of paper contained a short
message from myrtilla informing
younglove that the people at the ho-
boken station had telephoned to say
they could find no trace of the two
persons younglove had asked them to
search for in the yards also she was
enclosing a note that she herself had
opened because it seemed better to do
so in his absence

  this note had been brought to myr-
tilla by one of the elevator men who
said he had found it on the floor of
his car and was unable to guess even
who might have dropped it as the
building was crowded with people all
the afternoon

  younglove read the second en-

closure thoughtfully and went into one
of his concentrating moods over it as
well he might

  dear professor 

    i dont know whether this will ever
  reach you but if it doesnt i dont
  know what will happen to me i got
  out before uncle and the butcher ar-
  rived as there was nothing else to do

  i left that note for mrs baxter and
  now im scared stiff suppose ive
  been thinking it gave a turn to uncle
  and he got a shock then where
  would i be 

    i could never forgive myself if any-
  thing happened to him and besides
  the way his will is now i wouldnt get
  a cent

    you said youd manage this matter
  and you better had what do i know
  about disappearing i never disap-
  peared in my life

   ive been walking round central
 park till i feel even the statues could
 identify me im going to take a chance
 and sneak into your building on the
 basement floor and leave this in the
 elevator

    of course you always understood i
  hope that i meant to pay you well if
  you fixed up ralph and me and got us
  righted with uncle so dont think
  your time and expenses will not be ap-
  preciated

   but keep your promise and act at
  once i cant be left alone first by
  ralph and then by you and id rather
  lie ground up into mincemeat than
  marry the richest butcher in the bronx
  or anywhere else

             a friend in distress

   act at once younglove reflected
 and the only clue she gives me to act
 is the statues in central park yet
she says she does not know how to dis-
appear  

  he folded both enclosures replaced
them in the envelope which he put in
his pocket and telling algernon to
bid miss ashe wait for him at the office
dismissed the boy

   when youre all through with your
affairs ezra mccreevy opened up
tartly  i suppose youll remember
sir that you came here to repair the
damage you have done to mine or
maybe you think i can be coming- down
every day in the week to present a
husband to my fool-headed niece
nothing but the truth



  calm yourself-calm young-
love adjured waving his hands slowly
toward mccreevy the while his brain
was revolving a daring scheme to get
himself out of his present predicament
and gather a couple of rich clients

  all he needed was time time-that
no mans money could buy and only the
fertile mindof thaddeus younglove
could procure

  i wont be calm old ezra
squealed  drat my boots if ill be
calm just because you ask me 

   then listen and show some sense
younglove retorted  i have just re-
ceived word from my secretary who
had the pleasure of meeting miss mc-
creevy this morning that your niece
telephoned to the office at about a quar-
ter after four that she was leaving for
atlantic city to be gone for several
days

   she did not know when she would
be back but as she had an appointment
with me for to-morrow morning she
did not want me to be expecting her
 but miss mccreevy knew you
went after that worthless mr withing-
ton observed mrs baxter  and
why should she leave such a strange
letter for me slipping out of the house
unnoticed when she expected her uncle
because he had written to her 

   nothing is so easily explained
younglove answered  in the tumult-
uous conditions of her vibrations-

   oh drat vibrations  ezra ejacu-
lated

   well then in the state of mind
she found herself on account of mr
withingtons strange and sudden be-
havior she clean forgot about her un-
cles visit every idea went out of her
head except the mysterious conduct of
air withington is anything more
natural 

   but that letter she left for me
mrs baxter argued

  younglove asked to be allowed to
read the letter it was given to him
and having read it he returned it to
mrs baxter

   the letter just proves my point

younglove commented  she can
think of nothing but that man and his
two suit-cases when she wrote it she
probably had no idea where she was
going and therefore the letter is vague

   but you see that she is in her right
mind why shouldnt she go to at-
lantic city why shouldnt she can-
cel her appointments with me with her
dentist or anybody people forget to
do it often enough and it costs us time
and money but miss mccreevy is a
lady

   yes and there are millions of la-
dies in atlantic city ezra mccreevy
rasped  how are we going to find
her there  

   i dont think that should be hard
younglove replied talking slowly as
he realized the pyramid he was stand-
ing on end for himself  my secre-
tary asked for her address-as we
keep in close touch with all our clients
-and she said she did not know where
she would stop except that it would
be at some small quiet hotel we
could write to her in care of general
delivery

  if that aint my fool of a niece all
over cutting up like a monkey on a
stick ezra fairly gasped why
couldnt she act like any other woman
and wait till she got a husband to take
her to atlantic city 

   you forget my dear friend said
younglove with more assurance feel-
ing he had the company running with
him  that miss mccreevy had con-
tracted an attachment for mr with-
ington before you mentioned mr
swartz

   hang withington  cried ezra
 hes jest the most ornery sort of
quitter

   now if i might suggest a way to
you for handling miss  mccreevy in
her present disturbed condition-

   go ahead younglove i wish any-
body had the managing of her but me
good gravy if i had known forty
years ago a mans niece could give him
so much trouble id have married and
had trouble with children of my own


the all-story magazine

   then why dont you and mr
swartz go down to atlantic city
younglove asked  it will be easy to
trace your niece there through gen-
eral delivery

  me go to atlantic city ezra
demanded contemptuously  why i
havent been out of the bronx but
twice in the last twelve months thats
where my houses and land are and
thats where i belong

   but its like dis swartz inter-
posed  if we go to adlandig cidy
and find sarah cant i marry her by
der ocean just as well as here in new
york by land besides you was going
to come mit us anyway on der honey-
moon wasnt you till she got agguaint-
ed mit me  

  nothing of the sort ezra
snapped  whoever heard of a bridal
couple having a second man trailing
along on their honeymoon i meant
to get right back to my house in van-
dyver avenue this very evening

   i dont think it would be wise for
you to write to your niece and tell her
to return to new york in view of the
strain she is now under younglove
counseled  i urge you strongly to
go down there see her cheer her up-
both you and mr swartz-and of
course as mr swartz says miss mc-
creevy can be married at atlantic city
as easily as here

  ezra meditated puffing his thin lips
as though he had a pipe between them
 ill go then he announced at length
 but right away and now

   come on herman find your bag
and well be off theres any number
of trains to atlantic city and the
sooner i get down there and put some
sense into sarah the sooner ill be
back

  he got up sprylv from his chair and
trotted out to the hall to find his hat
and coat herman swartz lumbered
after him

  mrs baxter and mrs howe were
saying good-by when the latter broke
out with

   suppose the police should come

here about mr withington what could
we two women do  

   i never once thought of it  mrs
baxter cried  now mr mccreevy
i dont want the police coming to my
house unless youre here i dont
know how to talk to them and be-
sides-

   they wont come here mrs bax-
ter younglove put in with one of his
curved gestures that meant  dont
worry  ill have that alarm fixed
so the report will come to my address
that is unless you have an objection
mr mccreevy

   there cant be any report now
about sarah - that is we dont need
any-so longs we know where she is
said ezra opening the door  as
for that fellow withington-

   ill take care of him interposed
younglove  and if you and mr
swartz wish it ill show you the quick-
est way to atlantic city

  whether they very much wished it
or not younglove stuck to them like a
leech until he saw them irrevocably
aboard a train at the pennsylvania
station they had been obliged to
wait half an hour during which the
professor and ezra between them made
arrangements with the police over the
telephone

  younglove wanted ezra to cancel
the search order for his niece but the
old man declined saying 

  if shes in atlantic city it wont
do any harm and if she isnt it may
do some good with a woman like
sarah i wont be sure where she is
until i see her there

   and youll wire me your address
as soon as you find a stopping-place  
younglove asked

  herman swartz had already gone
into the car to pick a choice seat ezra
remained on the station platform talk-
ing with younglove for whom he was
beginning to show the faintest signs of
confidence and respect

   i will ezra replied  youll
keep me notified if anything important
happens wont you send your tele-
nothing but the truth



grams  collect  and presenting his
ticket he went through the gate

  to send his telegram  collect was
the only intimation younglove received
that ezra had any dawning suspicion
of compensating the professor for his
time and services yet younglove re-
turned to his office with the satisfac-
tion of knowing that his magnetic cur-
rents at first so repellent to sarahs
uncle were becoming- attractive

  if things went only half-way well
with him ezra in time should become
one of his most profitable patients it
made younglove smile to think of
sarahs worry about her uncles will

  though about sixty - five the old
man seemed sound and good for many
years to come the only thing the
matter with him was his cantankerous
disposition and his tendency to change
his mind unreasonably no person
was more suitable as a test for the
health circles theory and practise

  yet the professor had too risky and
perilous an enterprise under way now
to think of losing time patting himself
on the back ezra would not find his
niece at atlantic city and younglove
must have traced her before he re-
turned to new york if he hoped to
keep in the old mans good graces

  find sarah recover withington
and smooth the way to their union
meant money steady patients - and
myrtilla

  withington ought not to remain long
among the missing he reasoned be-
cause in his talk over the telephone
with the police he had been able to give
much more definite information about
the last seen of ralph and his dwarf
companion than ezra had provided

  sarah-as he murmured the name
to himself younglove thought of the
acreage of central park and the abso-
lute heedlessness of the woman in wri-
ting him a letter without putting any
address or place of meeting in it

  it was dark now she would not
dare stay in the park or would she
it might be she had ventured again to
communicate with his office

  it was six oclock when younglove
reached the office a light shone
through the glass half of the door but
the door was locked

  he opened it with his key not sur-
prised that algernon should be gone
but disappointed that myrtilla had not
waited for him

  a note lay on his desk it was
signed  m a

    i waited till a quarter before six
  and could wait  longer i told you
  it is my life-work to recover him ill
  be down first thing in the morning

 the message had palpably been
scrawled in haste younglove consid-
ered it in somewhat crestfallen mood

  he had counted on myrtilla to aid
him in tracing miss mccreevy he
had intended even having the money
to give her a good dinner at a restau-
rant and talk with her about the health
circle its fine prospects and about
himself

  from the moment she confided to
him her years - agone engagement to
ralph withington or walter raleigh
all the professors latent yearning for
his secretary grew more and more ap-
parent to him he was ready now to
neglect his business if necessary to
win her

  and in this most ticklish situation
in which he had ever been plunged she
had left the office with less courtesy
than she had always shown when she
could have had no idea that he cared
for her after he had sent a specific
message too by algernon that she
was to wait till he came

  he sat at his desk and ate a whole
box of loso peanuts the first morsel
of food he had tasted since breakfast

   i shall-i will be better for eating
loso peanuts he said to himself over
and over again

  at length the shadows fled from his
resilient brain he got up turned off
the lights and went out leaving all
care behind him

  he had decided to have a good din-
ner and then ride up - town and see
myrtilla at her apartment


the all-story magazine

  on his way to dinner he got in touch
again with the police over the tele-
phone and suggested that as miss mc-
creevy had always liked to walk in
central park it might be well to have
the park thoroughly searched 

chapter x

rival beauties

  not ten minutes before the arrival
of younglove had myrtilla written her
note to him and hurried away alger-
non was already dismissed when a
mans voice engaged her on the tele-
phone

c the man asked for professor
younglove but after some hesitation
seemed content to accept the ear of
his secretary on account of the profes-
sors absence

  then a woman spoke to her - the
woman she considered as the soil be-
neath her feet-yet whom she had to
deal with deferentially and what was
worse whom she had to fear

  it was sarah mccreevy

   you professor youngloves secre-
tary she asked almost petulantly
not that she meant to be but because
she was footsore and brain-weary

   i am miss ashe his secretary
myrtilla answered with reserved con-
tempt

   then for mercy sake tell him im
going crazy  poor sarah entreated
 i have been wandering round the
park all afternoon and here its dark
and i have no answer to the letter i
sent him and i dont know which way
to turn

   i didnt bring only a little money
with me and what will people think
of me going to a hotel alone and
ill have to stop disappearing and go
back and face the music with my uncle
unless the professor does what he said
he would do and ought to have done
two hours ago

   where are you now   asked myr-
tilla

 in a drug-store somewhere in one

hundred and tenth street i think i
am just cross the way from the park
tell him i wont pay him a cent of
what i promised unless he keeps his
word and whats more ill make him
give back that five dollars i paid him
already because its all his fault that
ralph ran away from me in the first
place and ill sue him for alienation
of affections

  myrtillas eyes glowed with a strange
light and one of her elizabethan sneer-
ing smiles curled on her lips

   the professor urges you to be
calm she said slowly though her
own brain whirled with an inspiration
that had just come to her

    be calm is that all he has to say
i wonder if hed be calm if he was in
my shoes  

   he could not remain here myr-
tilla went on  because he is treating
your uncle in order to bring him into
the proper frame of mind toward your
proposed marriage

   you mean hes trying to wean
him away from that german butcher
or what  

   hes trying to make him see things
with a little understanding of your
point of view and so he told me if
you called here or sent any word-

   sent any word  sarah interrupt-
ed sharply wasnt my letter any
word and pretty plain at that requir-
ing an answer right away 

  yes my dear myrtilla cooed
 but there was no address on your
letter the nearest thing to an address
was the statement that you had been
roaming in central park

  sarah was silent for a moment and
then confessed   honest miss ashe
there are times when i think my uncle
is right in calling me a fool but then
ive been so upset all day

   i cant say any more on the wire
myrtilla pursued  except that the
professor wants me to go to you at
once i will tell you everything when
i see you

  you mean you have news of
ralph  
nothing but the truth



   not yet but we have no reason not
to hope we shall have soon

   do you want me to go down to
the office  

   no no-for pitys sake no
myrtilla said quickly

  her scheme seemed better and better
the more she thought ahead with it
her dark eyes were dazzling bright
there was a note almost of gaiety in
her voice

  well what am i to do then
asked sarah

   you are to meet me at the corner
of one hundred and sixth street and
central park west in half an hour
thats about the time it will take me
to get there now be a good brave
girl and all will be well with you

   youre so kind i could kiss you
sarah cried emotionally over the wire

  myrtilla hung up her receiver ran
for her hat and coat and scribbled the
note for professor younglove the last
thing before she left the office

  there was a cruel smile on her face
she laughed now and then on her way
up - town and again she would say
repeatedly to herself snapping her
teeth together

   it is fate destiny and she must
not stand in the way of it 

  when sarah saw her get oft the car
at one hundred and sixth street she
made a rush for myrtilla and lifted
her off the ground embracing her and
hugging her

   what would have become of me
if it wasnt for you you dear darling
woman   cried sarah

  myrtilla yielded a traitorous kiss
and squeezed sarahs hand saying

   we must walk across town to
broadway and take a car there for i
live much farther to the north of the
metropolis and we must not be seen
bv any one who knows you

  sarah clung to myrtillas hand as
though she was a child while in fact
she would have made two of myrtilla
as far as height and frame go

   am i going to your house   in-
quired sarah innocently

  not so loud yes myrtilla an-
swered  the professor believes this
is the only safe way for you to disap-
pear because he may have to produce
you at any moment

   you said he went to see my
uncle  

   hes with your uncle now myr-
tilla said walking faster stimulated in
her design by the complete trustfulness
of the hot-headed guileless sarah

 we must not talk much until we get
to my apartment you never can tell
whos listening to you in the streets
or the cars

  this was sufficient for sarah there
was not a word from then until myr-
tilla stopped in front of her house
saying

   this is the darnley where i live

   is that a park across the street 
sarah inquired  and why is it up v
so high in the air  

   that is an ancient cemetery
myrtilla replied somberly  its up
high like that because all the place was
a hill about here in olden times before
the streets were cut through and lev-
eled

   bless me  sarah ejaculated trem-
ulously  do i have to be disappeared
across the way from a cemetery 

   i live at the rear of this mansion
and on the top floor myrtilla ex-
plained haughtily as they went in

   wont the hall-boy see me  sarah
inquired timidly

   there are no hall-boys and no ele-
vators in this building you must
know myrtilla informed sarah as
though sarah had been guilty of gross
impropriety in suggesting such an idea

 i abominate such modern nuisances
from two of my windows you will
have a view of the lordly hudson and
the unparalleled palisades thus you
need not pine for lack of beauteous
nature during your incarceration

   what lovely big words you speak
sarah declared admiringly not paying
much attention to what myrtilla meant
but rapt with the way she talked and
impressed with her queenlike airs


the all-story magazine

which became more queenlike as soon
as they came within her apartment

  myrtilla displayed her collection of
books on sir walter raleigh not one
of which she had ever read all she
knew about him and oueen elizabeth
she had imbibed from her mother by
word of mouth and had spent the rest
of her time growing up in the eliza-
bethan tradition she showed sarah
old english pewters and her historical
prints but sarahs heart was taken and
held by the kitchen

   oh if ralph and i could only be
married and have a dear little flat like
this  sarah cried  id cook and bake
for him the whole day long 

  myrtilla tossed her head and her
teeth gleamed under her smiling lip
but she said very sweetly

   sarah-you must let me call you
sarah-im afraid you will have to be
content with a slice of cold joint and
tea to-night because it would not lie
prudent for us to risk being seen in a
restaurant

   that will be fine sarah voted en-
thusiastically  you know im sick of
restaurants and the boarding-house
and i said to myself over and over
again once ralph and i got married
we would never-never-eat in a res-
taurant again

   let us eat something first myr-
tilla counseled in a tone rather ominous
 and then well discuss that gentle-
man

  though it was unpleasant to hear
ralph referred to as  that gentleman
sarah took no offense believing it was
merely i iss ashes manner of speech

  but when they were seated after
supper in the front room with two
shaded candles on a little round table
between them and myrtilla eyes and
teeth gleaming as if she would transfix
and gobble simple sarah at one and the
same time there came back to sarah
the strange ring in mvrtillas voice as
she said  that gentleman

   it is hard for me to do it myr-
tilla was saving now  but i must
you have been deceived in that man

  kindness made sarah pliable as
dough but strike a spark of antagonism
and all the courage of uncounted scot-
tish chiefs throbbed in her veins

   ralph deceive me ralph deceive
anybody  she cried  what rot you
are talking the poor dear never told
a lie in his life thats just what kept
him sad and made other people sad
and avoid him he simply would tell
nothing but the truth

   in the first place myrtilla contin-
ued steady and baleful  ralph with-
ington is not really his name

   o-ho  sarah laughed and ran up
a crescendo of giggles  thats the best
i ever heard

   the mans real name is walter
raleigh laugh thdigh you may myr-
tilla  proceeded tense and dramatic
 several years ago in a beautiful city
a thousand miles from here he was
solemnly betrothed to wed a girl of his
own class and station

   well--of all things  cried sarah
her face red with anger and i sup-
pose you think im not good enough
to get off at the same station he does
 i mean rank lineage myrtilla de-
claimed rearing herself haughtily on

   	o	j

her chair  you must hear me out
and believe me as you will or not he
abandoned this girl not long after the
betrothal slipped away from his home
in the night like a thief changed his
name and came east his coming to
professor younglove to-day undid
him his villainy came to the surface
he knew there was no hope for him
save in flight and so -myrtillas
voice trailed down the steep- he
fled

   i knew all the time it was that old
loso younglove that got us into this
mess sarah declared smacking the
table with the palm of her hand  and
now he has me on the run too see
here myrtilla im going to cut this dis-
appearing act

   if i had known that was why poor
ralph ran away i never would have
done it i would have faced my uncle
and made him help me find the dear
nothing but the truth



   fellow look at all the time ive wasted
   and nearly walked the legs off myself
   in central park where did you put
   my hat  and sarah stood up

     what-you would trust him when
  he has abandoned- myrtilla was say-
  ing slowly

     pie wont abandon me i know
  that myrtilla and thats all any wom-
  an needs to know about a man

     but suppose the other woman
  wont let you-that is obliges him to
  abide by his betrothal which was duly
  recorded and published   said myr-
  tilla

   who is she where is she
  asked sarah squaring her shoulders
  and looking about as though the wom-
  an might be in hiding in the flat

      that of course youll have to find
   out from professor younglove myr-
   tilla said  now like a brave dear
   representative of your sex sarah sit
   down and be calm remember the
   health circle

      ill sit down myrtilla but as for
   being calm you might as well ask me
  to stand on my head what i want to
  know is whether the professor is work-
  ing for me or for this other person 
   he is working for you that i can
  say positively and this positively myr-
  tilla believed

    it was because she saw how deter-
  mined younglove was to bring the man
  who called himself withington and sa-
  rah together that she had the inspira-
  tion to put a spoke in his wheel by
  taking sarah secretly in charge

     if i can only see walter long
  enough she reasoned  to talk with
  him sensibly and bring back all those
  far-gone days of bliss unalloyed im
  sure hell forget his mad act and all its
  consequences and return to the bosom
  to which he rightfully belongs

      if youre sure hes working for my
  interest sarah remarked as if speak-
  ing to herself  then i suppose i ought
  to be content to stay here and await
  instructions but i dont feel like it
  and i wish you had kept those lies
  about ralph to yourself myrtilla

   it is much wiser to know why he
ran away my dear sarah than to be
in the dark about him	

    i know that and im grateful to
you sarah admitted as she touched
her eyelids suspiciously with a corner
of her handkerchief  when i think
i used nearly to kill myself laughing
at him and ever since this morninsr mv

                       o j

eyes are like two pumps i know i
wouldnt laugh if i saw him now

  she got up and went round to em-
brace myrtilla

   forgive me dear she entreated

 pm such a fool but any woman is
when shes in love some day youll
realize it yourself

  some day myrtilla echoed her
eyes shining her lip curved in the
haughty sneering smile that she con-

	sidered one of her ancestral accom-
plishments

   the situation was one to stir myrtil-
las romantic nature to the depths she
felt triumphantly that she was acting
with a finesse and cleverness worthy of
her elizabethan lineage

   the poor simple hot-headed sarah
mccreevy had given herself into her
power trustingly without question
myrtilla could keep her captive in the
flat under the circumstances as safely
as though she had her shut up in a
dungeon on the english estate that she
always envisaged as her ultimate resi-
dence

   professor younglove in seeking out
the man who falsely called himself
ralph withington would be playing
right into her hand when he believed
he was working only for the renown
and profit of his plealth circle

  the buzzing of the door-bell gave
sudden pause to myrtillas gloating re-
flections

    quick quick sarah  she whis-
pered taking the limp sarah by the
hand  nobody must see you here--
no one not even my washerwoman
thats the professors orders

   myrtilla pressed the button of the
door-opener in the kitchen and left sa-
rah shut up in that small room


the all-story magazine

   its the safest place for you dear
she said

  can i wash the dishes sarah
asked i-got to do something im
that nervous

   look at the evening paper and
make no noise myrtilla advised  if
its the washerwoman i wont be kept
more than ten minutes but dont come
out of here or you will ruin all the pro-
fessors plans for your happiness
even if sarah had had the least idea
of doing anything but obeying myrtil-
las mysterious orders she could not
have gone very far myrtilla locked
both bedroom doors and the rear door
of the flat before going into the parlor

  there were two doors of solid wood
and two rooms between her and sarah
pulling a heavy portiere across the
door between the first bedroom and
the parlor myrtilla draped herself
against it statuesquelv for a moment
saying inwardly

   my success is only beginning i
must be calm

  poised and listening she heard a
light step coming along the hall and
then a knock on the parlor door
myrtilla opened it at once

   good evening myrtilla profes-
sor younglove greeted her  and good
health i just had to come to see you
for a moment

  myrtilla noted that his habitual
smile was weary and that altogether
his presence lacked the usual cheer and
sprightliness

   welcome professor she said
and indicated a chair to him

  you did not wait for me at the
office i was disappointed he told
her and sat down slowly

   the toil of the day the medley of
sensations and emotions professor
were too much for me you will un-
derstand that after all these years of
hoping and striving to find him how
great a strain i have been under

   ive had a long hard day myself
younglove returned and the way
things look now i dont expect to sleep
much to-night

   then you have word of wralter-
i mean well you know  

   not a word nor of her either
you read the letter that came from
her saying she was roaming about
central park did you not  

   it seemed better for me to read it
when you avere not at the office i
felt  might be able to do something
right off

   i counted on that much intelli-
gence and loyalty from you myrtilla
younglove observed and leaning for-
avard in his chair murmured softly  i
count on a good deal from you per-
haps much more than i shall ever get
yet working along the curved line of
the health circle i tell myself i will i
shall succeed

   myrtilla i never realized until to-
day how fond i have-grown of you
ive been absorbed in my devotion to
humanity not conscious though sub-
conscious of the fact all along that you
avere the dearest person of all hu-
manity to me still i have been using
every effort to recover this man avho
-well who seems disinclined to marry
you

   everything must yieldbefore the
destiny to which walter and i avere
vowed solemnly so many years agone
myrtilla declared in low thrilling tones

   do you expect to make him marry
you  

   he avill listen to reason and the
call of duty professor i shall per-
suade him back again to the dear
sweet being he avas in adolescence if
only i can be with him long enough
 you cant say im not doing my
best to find him though its against my
own interest can you myrtilla

   i wonder myrtilla asked coyly
shaking the twinkling patent-leather
toe of her shoe under the edge of her
skirt and i have wondered whether
you are not making these endeavors as
much for that person sarah mc-
creevy as for me  

   i get all the blame for her disap-
pearance younglove ansavered
promptly  her uncle threatened to
nothing but the truth



put me out of business hinted that i
was all kinds of a faker the old man
is positively erratic in his vibrations
there was no way of handling him ex-
cept on an intricate curved line

  the professor narrated the ruse by
which lie had induced ezra and mr
swartz to go to atlantic city

   but he wont find her there myr-
tilla remarked with a dawning smile
 youll be worse off i fear me when
he comes back

   i felt i could get hold of her in a
day or two i think i can keep her
uncle and his butcher away for that
long if she stays anywhere in new
york we ought to get news of her and
of ralph withington soon because
her uncle sent out a police alarm for
both of them

  a police alarm myrtilla echoed
with a shudder  how inexpressibly
plebeian

   oh its a still alarm younglove
explained quickly  the papers wont
hear anything about it for a few days
at least the old man is  more
anxious to get his own name or his
nieces into print than you or i are to
see ours

   if he had any real family pride or
any family to be really proud of pro-
fessor it seems to me he might have
engaged a private detective agency

   he does everything in jerks
younglove told her  and thats why
 had to send him and his butcher off
the field or you and i myrtilla would
not be able to do anything without
having him interfere

   i must say myrtilla replied cold-
ly  that i am interested in finding
only one person i do not need to tell
you who that is

  a loud knock on the hall door
caused myrtilla to start violently

   my vibrations are all awry i fear
me she sighed  it is the dreadful
day ive been through

  she was reasoning that the bell must
have rung in the kitchen sarah had
answered it with the door-opener
would professor younglove suspect

that any other person than themselves
was in her apartment 

  meanwhile she had opened the door
to see a messenger-boy

   is professor younglove here care
of miss ashe  the boy asked

   for you professor myrtilla said
waving the boy within the room with
a queenly gesture

   are you sent from the hotel rad-
ford younglove inquired taking
the telegram and signing for it

   yes sir

  younglove gave the boy a tip who
vanished with a grin and a mumbled
thanks

   i left word with the night clerk at
my hotel younglove explained while
he tore open the message  that if he
heard from the police about mr with-
ington or miss mccreevy he was to
send a boy right up here even if i
should be gone as i was going to re-
turn to the radford straight from see-
ing you

  one glance at the night clerks note
was sufficient for younglove he
handed it to myrtilla clapped his
hands together and said with sup-
pressed enthusiasm

   nothing but success lies inside the
health circle see for yourself

   it is the destiny of the raleighs
which cannot be evaded myrtilla
droned solemnly a glitter of rejoicing
in her dark eyes

  younglove warmed with admira-
tion at her pose and her brilliant orbs
but the raleigh-talk made his back
ache

   i have read it she said returning
the note  night though it be we
must venture forth at once

   what you myrtilla  younglove
queried considering the note anew
 he says a police sergeant informs
me that ralph withington and his
dwarf companion are at the hotel di
rocca in the bronx theres no
charge against them but the police
think they can persuade them to stay
where they are for a little while have
you any idea where kalima avenue


the all-story magazine

and one hundred and sixtieth street
is in the bronx 

   though we did not arrive at the
hotel di rocca before dawn still i
should go with you professor

  if the professor had only known
what was going on inside myrtillas
brain he would have j understood that
her greater worry than a night adven-
ture into the bronx was what she was
to contrive as an excuse for leaving
sarah mccreevy alone in the apart-
ment how also was she to keep her
there assuredly until she returned j

   the first thing to do professor
said myrtilla taking things in her own
hands as she had never presumed be-
fore to dare  is for you to go out and
hire a taxicab this is all my affair
and i cannot think of letting you go
to any expense in the matter

  she told him where he could find a
taxicab station at which she had an
account

   if you bring the vehicle inside of
ten minutes-

   but my dear myrtilla he pro-
tested  this appears a most impru-
dent thing for you to do why not let
me see the man first and talk to him
itll be eleven oclock before i get to
the hotel di rocca

   each minute lost is like a day to
me she argued  and suppose that
mccreevy person should have located
him before we do have you thought
of that

   thats impossible

   impossible  nothing is impossi-
ble to a-i must steady my vibrations
quickly professor i entreat you and
myrtilla held the door open for him

   in ten minutes then younglove
agreed wearily

  if she must come she would and
already his fertile mind had begun to
frame a plan for recovering sarah
through the medium of ralph with-
ington how he was to do this he did
not know but he did know that he
would have to do it somehow

  at this very moment the testy and
irascible ezra mccreevy and his prac-

tical friend swartz who was bent on
being back to his butcher-sore first
thing monday morning might be pre-
paring to come to new york next day
having found no trace of sarah at
general delivery orany other place in
atlantic city

  myrtilla steadied herself to face
sarah she unlocked the first bed-
room door she slipped on her jacket
and hat noting that sarahs things lay
safely on the bed she stowed them
in one of her closets under several
other garments

  she unlocked the door of the second
bedroom and passed through hurried-
ly she would tell sarah that profes-
sor younglove was still in consultation
with her uncle and mr swartz at the
baxter boarding-house where they
were decided to remain until sarah ap-
peared there or was discovered

  yet she had also some good news for
sarah professor younglove had re-
ceived a message about ralph or some
one who was said to look like him

  this message seemed to be worth
investigation and as professor
younglove was about to stay with mr
mccreevy laboring on sarahs behalf
he had instructed myrtilla to follow
up the message in the mean time it
was of the highest importance that
sarah remain in seclusion

  some moments elapsed before myr-
tilla was able to convince herself that
all this elaborate preparation was waste
of energy

  she gazed about bewildered she
tried the back door of the flat the
spring-lock was fast and also the key-
lock the key was in her pocketbook
where she had put it after shutting
sarah in the kitchen

  no sign of sarah was to be seen

  myrtilla made another and more de-
tailed search of the small kitchen the
window leading to the fire escape was
bolted as it had been all day during her
absence

  but the dumb-waiter door was open
and the dumb-waiter was at the bottom
of the shaft
the  v  force



  the low common thing myr-
tilla said to herself staring down into
the blackness

  in the queenly elizabethan aura that
enveloped myrtilla a dumb-waiter was
a place only for tradesmen janitors
and sneak-thieves

  sarah had escaped without coat hat
or gloves and it was a chill night

   a woman of her class is capable
of anything myrtilla murmured half
aloud puzzled to fathom what sudden
reason had impelled sarah to flee

  she had apparently confided in myr-

ito be c

tiha completely and seemed as con-
tent as it was possible to be in her
refuge

  the doorbell rang myrtilla awoke
to the fact that she was keeping pro-
fessor younglove and the taxicab
waiting

   as you will then sarah myr-
tilla said addressing the dumb-waiter
shaft with dignity but you cant
come back even if you would

   then bolting the dumb-waiter door
myrtilla hastened down-stairs to join
professor younglove

 n  n a ed  

i

   examined the bar of metal
   closely

     subsequent measurements
showed it to be fourteen inches long
three inches wide and three-quarters
of an inch thick on the broad sur-
face about the center was engraved a
circle with strokes radiating from it
possibly a conventionalized represen-
tation of the sun beyond this no
marks were visible

the metal itself so far as i could
judge was a very hard steel with a

c smale

curious ruddy iridescence on the sur-
face somewhat reminding me of the
appearance of  shot  silk when
suspended between the fingers and
thumb and struck sharply it rang with
a clear bell-like note evidently there
was no flaw in the metal

   do you believe it  i asked look-
ing up from my examination

  walter surtees shrugged his shoul-
ders

  twenty years residence in the
east said he  have taught me to be-
lieve many stranger things

 but this i protested  x mere


the all-story magazine

bar of inanimate metal to have all the
powers you ascribe-

   excuse me he corrected  i
dont ascribe any powers to it-at least
you havent heard me do so yet - i
have merely retailed to you the state-
ment made to me by the tibetan
priest who gave it to me

   has it the ordinary magnetic
properties said i but of course
you have thought of that

  walter surtees smiled

   yes i have tested it ut it doesnt
even lift iron-filings no it isnt a
mere bar-magnet whatever it is

   but that stuff about the  periodic
powers  said i if there is any-
thing in it at all it must be permanent
i am inclined to think the whole thing
is a fable i dare say those artful
priests were able to play some curious
tricks with it its their business

  my friend looked queerly at me for
a moment before he spoke

   well to be frank with you said
he  there is something supernormal
about it i havent confined my ex-
periments to poking it among iron-
filings

  what else then i asked curi-
ously

   it shines in the dark for one
thing he replied

  i laughed

   radium i suggested  possibly
it contains a minute quantity but
that wasnt what you were going to
tell me you would hardly call look-
ing at it in the dark an experiment

  surtees rose and went to the door
of the room

   you shall see for yourself said
he

  he opened the door and whistled
softly presently a huge gray cat in-
sinuated itself into the room and
rubbed affectionately against my
friends leg purring gently the while

  surtees closed the door and re-
turned to his chair

   now watch said he

  the cat followed him for a yard or
two then it seemed to grow suddenly

  uneasy its fur rose and its tail be-
came enlarged

  in obedience to a sign from surtees
i placed the bar which i was still hold-
ing on the floor the cat watched it
as though fascinated and mewed plain-
tively it now seemed more terrified
than angry

  slowly as though against its will
the animal drew nearer with a curious
sidling movement until at last it lay
close to the bar motionless and- appar-
ently exhausted

   that is certainly queer said i
thoughtfully  i say i added look-
ing up sharply  youre not playing
any hanky-panky tricks old chap
walter surtees shook his head
gravely he was watching the cat

   there may be some odor clinging
to it which we cannot ourselves de-
tect i suggested  and which the cat
can and finds rather overpowering
 i never knew an odor to affect a
cat or any other animal in that
fashion returned surtees  this
morning it only fluffed up and swore
at the thing now it seems to be de-
cidedly more impressed

  he rose and lifted the cat gently
then he started and examined the
animal closely

   why its dead  he cried
dead i echoed nonsense
 dead as mutton repeated sur-
tees  luckily it is my own cat and
not the landladys poor brute i
was going to show you something else
the canary-

   no thanks said i  well spare
the canary if you dont mind

  after spending some time in futile
examinations of both bar and poor
pussy we left the bar where i had
placed it on the carpet and passed to
some other of my friends curios

  but it was of no use that infernal
bar fascinated both of us at last
surtees muttered something under his
breath and picking it up replaced it
carefully in a leather case

 you take good care of it i re-
marked
the v force



   it may resent neglect replied my
friend lightly

   look here old chap said i sud-
denly  if i were you fd take an early
train to brighton or southend and
chuck that thing off the end of a pier
-leather case and all

   i am waiting to see what will hap-
pen he returned in a curious dull
tone  i intend to see it out

   is there nothing that will check its
influence i suggested no anti-
dote

   nothing opaque to it so to speak
i have thought of that i tried lots of
things this morning glass electrified
and normal-silk water shellac a
score or other things i even borrowed
an air-pump from the science school
yonder and tried a vacuum no use
any of it

   didnt you learn anything of its
nature from the man who gave it to
you 

   he simply told me that he had
taken it from the robe of a fellow
priest whom he found crushed to
death

  crushed to death how

  walter surtees shrugged his shoul-
ders

   some sort of panic i believe
there was a big crowd of fanatics at
some shrine or other and this man
seemed to have got underfoot the
story was very vague

   and he had this thing on him
said i musingly looking at the case on
the table

  surtees nodded

  i rose and as i did so i swayed sud-
denly

   hold up - whats the matter -
dizzy exclaimed surtees

   its that confounded juju of
yours i gasped catching sight of a
rather white face in the mirror i
pulled myself together and reached the
door

   ive found a better name for it
than that said walter surtees  the
 v  force - the vital force you
know

    	s

   well leave it at that said i feel-
ing angry with myself and the mys-
terious drawing power which i still
felt though less strongly  call it
what you like but i repeat my advice
get rid of it or it may play cat-tricks
with you and i touched the dead ani-
mal with my foot

  surtees seemed preoccupied and
scarcely replied to my  good night

  i went slowly down the stairs with
an uneasy feeling that i was leaving
him to face some unknown danger
alone i hesitated and half turned
back then i heard the piano sur-
tees was playing one of his favorite
 chants sans paroles i laughed to
myself

   music hath charms i muttered
 it may soothe even a steel bar

  yet i could not shake off the mem-
ory of that poor brute of a cat and the
mysterious suddenness with which
death had come to it

ii

  two days afterward i was at bex-
hill on some business connected with
property i had there i found it nec-
essary to stay the night and as i was
leaving my hotel for a stroll and last
pipe before going to bed the boots
handed me a telegram it was from
surtees forwarded to me from my
town address the message was brief
but sufficiently disturbing it ran

come to pelham street at once

 urgent	surtees

  finding it would be impossible for
me to reach pelham street until well
after midnight i hastily wrote a letter
explaining my sudden change of plan
and left it for the man with whom i
had an appointment in the morning

  at first the matter of the bar did not
occur to me and as surtees was of
rather an impulsive nature i thought
his desire to see me might have its
origin in some legal bother connected
with a certain troublesome brother of
his of whom i knew


the all-story magazine

  it was a dark foggy night when i
arrived at pelham street and the raw
mist seemed to penetrate to my bones
there was a faint glow in the window
of surteess sitting-room-not bright
enough to indicate that he was up and
about-but more as though a bright
clear fire had been left burning in the
grate then i remembered that he
used a gas-stove and was momentarily
puzzled

  there seemed nothing to indicate
impatience or anxiety on his part and
as i had run out of tobacco i decided
to go on to the public-house at the
corner-it was not yet midnight-and
replenish my stock before seeing sur-
tees who smoked a brand too potent
for me

  i strode on past the house with this
intent when suddenly my legs became
leaden and i felt as though i were bat-
tling against a strong head wind yet
the murky stillness of the atmosphere
told me that such was not the case i
strove against the unseen power which
was holding me back but with each
step it grew stronger

  the street was deserted or my
quaint struggles might have roused
some doubts as to my sobriety

  as i paused in bewilderment a
ragged tramp came shuffling along
as he passed me he gave a curious
growl and staggered against the wall
with odd inconsistency i muttered
 drunk  and obeying an uncon-
trollable impulse i stepped back to the
door of surteess lodgings and rang
the bell

  getting no reply i tried the door
found it unlocked and breathing
slightly quicker than usual i mounted
the stairs and knocked at surteess
door

   who is there  asked a low muf-
fled voice which i nevertheless recog-
nized as that of my friend and i an-
swered sharply

   thank heaven  said the voice
come in-but take care-take care

  i opened the door and beheld a
strange scene

  surtees lay in a huddled position on
the floor close to his face - within
twelve inches-was the bar it shone
with a dull radiance which filled the
room and by its light i saw that sur-
teess eyes were fixed upon it and
slightly crossed as in a hypnotic trance

  as i stood momentarily in horrified
surprise i became conscious of an al-
most overwhelming desire to grovel
on the floor also something seemed
to draw me forward and downward
with compelling force surtees spoke
jerkily and as a man struggling breath-
lessly with an opponent

  thank heaven-in time-i hope
he gasped while i grasped the door-
lintel and listened

   discovered - antidote   he went
on after a moment  direct sunlight
-even daylight- weakens-nights-
powerful-stronger each night- my
lord 

  he broke off with a scream

  it-draws-life he moaned

  he had never turned his eyes to me
once all this time and he now col-
lapsed limply by the side of the ac-
cursed bar

   look-out  he whispered

  at first i thought he meant this
simply as a warning to myself then
his real meaning flashed upon me and
bracing myself up i made determined-
ly for the window i reached it in a
staggering drunken fashion and mov-
ing the blind aside peeped down into
the street below my head humming
like a beehive the while

  three figures including a police-
man were loitering with apparent
aimlessness directly beneath

  as i looked a stout man came
hastening along i caught sight of his
purple anxious face in the light of a
lamp when he came up he checked
his pace abruptly and lurched aside
the policeman seized him and held
him up while the other two men
seemed to look stupidly on

  the sound of the constables gruff
voice came faintly to my ear now
came a hansom driven rapidly di-
the v force



rectly beneath the horse reared up on
its haunches there were shouts and
a crash of broken glass the hansom
had turned over

  the street all at once seemed full of
people and a womans scream rang out
shrilly i dropped the blind and turned
aside

  what does this mean i asked
and my voice shook  surely this
devilish thing-

  surtees turned his bloodshot eyes
on me with an effort

   i cannot check he whispered
hoarsely  all-london-crushed-
death  crowd-mob-panic 

   what must we do  i cried

   big risk-

  i made a gesture of impatience the
movement turned to burlesque by the
force which i felt dragging at every
nerve and muscle what could be
worse than our present position 

   well beat it somehow i said

  make-rush said surtees faintly

  i had unconsciously crept to his side
 and we spoke in whispers

  what--how i said vaguely i
felt a leaden dulness coming over me

  walter surtees gave an odd croak-
ing laugh

   a chase 

   and if we cannot get away

   remember - priest of llassi 
was his reply

   come then said i  the sooner
the better i am the stronger - ill
take it

   no whispered surtees promptly

  there was no time for argument

   let us carry it together said i
 your right hand-my left

  he nodded

   glove he muttered

  i understood and drew off the thick
glove from his left hand and placed
it on my own

   now said i

   ready  he muttered beiween
clenched teeth we stretched out our
hands together

  the bar seemed to leap toward us
and there was a sound of impact as it

met our hands as though it were
welded to us i shuddered

  we leaped to our feet a curious
sense of power tingling through our
veins the spell seemed to have been
broken

  meanwhile the sounds outside had
risen to a roar and the street was filled
by a seething panic-stricken mob

iii

   the back  cried surtees

  we dashed from the room holding
the bar between us our strength
seemed irresistible we moved as one
individual and even our unspoken
thoughts seemed in unison

  we burst through the flimsy door
leading to the back premises carrying
it clear off its hinges and i afterward
found that the jagged iron of one of
these had caused a nasty gash in my
shoulder

  i felt nothing then

  on we raced through a yard and
into a narrow lane then without a
word passing between us we burst off
like some quaint quadruped for a
few minutes we saw no one then sud-
denly we found ourselves in a main
thoroughfare-the edgeware road i
think but am not sure

  it was now nearly one in the morn-
ing and very few people were about
but we were dimly conscious of curi-
ous swervings on the part of those we
did pass and presently we heard the
pattering of footsteps behind us we
kept to the center of the road which
at that hour presented few obstacles
we could not have dropped the bar
now even had we desired to do so

  our pursuers seemed to be growing
in numbers they were horribly si-
lent there were no shouts-no cries
to those ahead to stop us-only that
fearsome patter of many feet behind

  we diyecl down a side street which
took us into an open space-norfolk
crescent we found it to be afterward
it might have been the top of the mon-
ument for all we knew then appar-


the all-story magazine

ently our pursuers had received a
check but even as we paused a second
the head of the procession poured into
the crescent

  at the curb in front of one of the
houses stood a motor-car-a long low
erav machine

	

  quick panted surtees hoarsely
speaking for the first time during our
flight

  we literally flew to the car the
chauffeur was dozing in furs as we
came up he lurched sidewise and fell
almost at our feet we scrambled
over him into the car and while sur-
tees seized the steering-wheel with his
free hand i jerked back the starting-
lever

  luckily we both understood mo-
tors the vision of a wild-eyed man
clutching vainly at the back of the car
danced momentarily across my vision

	reached back to fling him off and a
sea of fierce gibbering faces seemed to
glide smoothly away

  i looked round dazedly we were
on a broad road which appeared to
stretch away into infinity

  surtees sat beside me his jaw set
like iron and his eyes glowing like
live coals under his knit brows

   cannot we drop this infernal
thing it is like being handcuffed
said i

  i had no need to raise my voice
the car was almost noiseless

   try said surtees grimly

  but my hand felt paralyzed i real-
ized that i had no power over it but
i was desperate it seemed ridicu-
lous that i should not be able to con-
quer this mere piece of metal

  lowering the bar of course with
surteess hand as well i placed my
foot upon it and we wrenched our
bodies back suddenly

  i groaned with pain half the flesh
seemed torn from my hand-but we
were free and our tyrant lay at the
bottom of the car

   shall i kick it out  said i

   no-no   replied surtees  the

  i understood he meant to give this
thing effectual burial

  i leaned back and laughed a little
i was just beginning to realize what
we had done and were doing

   where are we   i asked

   great bath road he answered
 but the sea  i exclaimed  why
not the norfolk or sussex coast 

   i didnt stop to think it out re-
turned surtees dryly

   then we must go on-

   until dawn

   and then-

   relief and freedom said surtees
his eyes fixed on the road before him

  the houses were thinning now and
there were no lights fortunately
those of the car were powerful

   well we are free now said i
if it comes to that

   try to rise was surteess com-
ment only dont fall out

  i seized the side of the car and
strove to raise myself from the seat
it was impossible and i sank back in
renewed dismay it was as though we
were bound down by iron bands

   sunlight the only antidote my
friends words flashed through my
brain truly we must go on-until
the dawn

   is there petrol enough   i asked
  surtees shrugged his shoulders

   i hope so

   where are we going 

   devon or cornwall what is the
time  

  my watch had stopped but just then
we heard a bell somewhere give a soli-
tary stroke

   one said surtee  sunrise half
past six or thereabouts-over five
hours

  the effects of our violent exercise
were passing off and after binding up
surteess wounded hand as well as my
own i busied myself with hunting out
the rugs which had been considerately
left in the car i found no goggles or
vizors and as the roads were in perfect
condition neither muddy nor dusty we
had no need of such
the v force



  we had met very few vehicles a
belated four-wheeler or two and one
other motor were all and we were going
at too great a speed for the bar to have
any effect on those

  when we overtook anything how-
ever it was different this only hap-
pened once-between slough and maid-
enhead on a long stretch of road we
rapidly overhauled the red light of an-
other car and as we came within thir-
ty yards or so it suddenly slackened
speed so that we almost dashed into it

  we swerved aside and dashed by
the other car seemed to leap at us
and the occupants to tumble together
of a heap i set my teeth and held
tight but we just managed to clear
them only our great speed saved them
and us from what would no doubt have
been a particularly complicated smash-
up

  it must have been a very mystified
party of motorists that we left behind
but we never learned that any one of
them was hurt fortunately through-
out the whole of our journey the expe-
rience was not repeated

  i need not detail the entire course of
that trying journey we got no chance
of bite or sup

  luckily the car held out and the
gray light of dawn overtook us on the
north coast of cornwall where we
drew up at last somewhere between
padstow and newquay near the edge
of high cliffs directly overlooking the
sea

  our red-rimmed eyes looked out
from pallid dust-begrimed faces over
a slate-colored expanse of waters we
were cold and faint with hunger

  with an effort i managed to drag
myself from the car but was for some
minutes unable to stand natural stiff-
ness seemed all we had to contend with
now true our limbs seemed leaden
and we lurched drunkenly against the
side of the car but presently we real-
ized that the dread power of the bar
was almost if not quite vanquished

  what would not we have given for
a flask of brandy or even hot coffee-

tea-anything to ease our parched
throats and warm our chilled blood

  presently the ruddy rim of sun shot
over the horizon to our right and sur-
tees staggering to the car rolled back
the rugs and seized the bar recklessly
he held it to the ruddy beams of the
rising monarch which were struggling
through the wintry morning mist

  he gave a crazy chuckling laugh
then his face changed and a furious
expression came over it

   curse it  he cried and turning
seaward he drew back his arm and
flung tle bar with all his strength far
out over the dull-gray waters

  we could not discern the tiny splash
where it fell some twenty or thirty
yards from the shore and in as we aft-
erward ascertained about twenty-eight
fathoms of water

  we stood gazing dumbly for a mo-
ment then we realized that we were
at last rid of our ghastly incubus and
we danced on the grassy sward like
lunatics

   sorry for the fish said i

   whatever the infernal thing can
do said surtees  it cant rise from
the sea

  ave turned to the car and our eyes
met surtees laughed rather grimly

   we are in for trouble said he

   on the contrary we are just rid of
it i returned lightly  we have only
to explain-

  i paused and surtees laughed again

   who will believe  said he  no
-we must clear out the machine is
useless to us now there is no petrol
we must leave it here

  i stood doubtfully and was about to
make some suggestion i know not
what when a glance seaward drove
the blood from my face afresh

   look-look  i cried

  at the spot where the bar had sunk
was a huge mound of water like a gi-
gantic wave the surface of it was
white with foam and though it was as
yet in the shadow of the cliff i thought
i could discern something writhing
and leaping therefrom


the all-story magazine

  walter surtees and i gazed spell-
bound a sea-fog was rolling in rap-
idly growing denser every moment
and ere it blotted the great tossing wave
from our view i fancied i saw a terri-
ble scaly head arise from the turmoil
- a hideous monster with wildly
whirling tentacles and ghastly wide-
open eyes

  then the fog hid all we lingered
no longer but turned and ran wildly
whither we knew not-anywhere away
from that awful nightmare

  wre escaped all awkward inquiries
more by luck than anything else we
found ourselves possessed of a few
pounds in cash enough to take us safely
to falmouth and thence to jersey and
france where we lay perdu for a while
easily reenforcing our funds by means
of letters to our bankers

  the english newspapers were par-
ticularly interesting to us during the
next few days

  we read how the hon stockwood
ridgeways motor-car had been found
deserted on the cornish cliffs of the
mysterious happenings in the neighbor-
hood of pelham street w and of the
no less inexplicable slaughter of fish
near the coast where the car was found

some hundreds of tons being cast up on
the neighboring ssnds every tide for
some weeks following but a conve-
nient theory of submarines accounted
for the last named and curiously
enough the  riot as it was termed
in pelham street of which after all
a few broken limbs wrere the worst re-
sults was never connected in any way
by the press with the  hiring  of the
car

  i suppose our exit by the back door
and dash down the lane broke the link
which might have somewhat enlight-
ened the public yet what more would
they have learned

  what do even walter surtees and i
know after all where is the accursed
bar now 

  walter surtees suggests that some ill-
advised saurian has swallowed it and
borne it off to spread calamity in other
climes when its periodic power shall
return

  i have sometimes wrondered wheth-
er this story may not contain a clue
to the fatal and unaccountable devia-
tions of ships from their correct
courses when near the cornish coasts

  however here my story ends as far
as i know it

  i hope it may never have a sequel

chapter xvi

ale together-

when lila reached the lobby
of the lamartine at nine
oclock on the following
morning she found the erring knights
already assembled in their corner

for a moment she forgot everything

bean august all-story magazine



else in her surprise she had thought
that nothing less than the end of the
world could possibly have roused these
gentlemen of leisure from their beds
at so early an hour

  dougherty hastened over to her
desk and demanded to know why she
had left her room

  why not lila smiled i feel

             single copies  cents


the all-story magazine

all right really and anyway i had
rather be down here than up there
alone did you see him 

  the ex-prizefighter grunted an af-
firmative and proceeded to give her a
detailed account of his conversation
with knowlton on the previous morn-
ing he ended by saying that they
had engaged a lawyer and that the
sinews of war in the sum of three
thousand dollars had been entrusted to
dumain as treasurer

   but mr dougherty lila ex-
claimed  we cant possibly use that
i thought - you see i have saved a
little-

  dougherty interrupted her

   now see here were doing this
and youve got to let us alone any-
way its not really costing us a cent
i wont explain how but you can take
my word for it

   everythings all right and you
dont need to worry and for heavens
sake dont begin any of that stuff
about you wont take this and you
wont take that if were going to
help you weve got to help you what
did you think i meant yesterday morn-
ing-that i was going to carry a note
to knowlton and then go home and sit
down with my fingers crossed 
whereupon giving her no time to
answer dougherty turned and re-
joined the others across the lobby

  this was the beginning of a cam-
paign which lasted a little over a
month

  the duties of the erring knights
were varied and arduous each morn-
ing one of them conducted lila to the
hotel and took her home each eve-
ning this escort being necessitated by
the fact that sherman had twice ac-
costed her on the street he had also
called at her home but there was no
necessity for a male guardian there
mrs amanda berry was a legion in
herself

  dougherty was the official messen-
ger between the lamartine and the
tombs at first lila had insisted on
going to see knowlton herself but he

had begged her to spare him this final
humiliation

  the prisoner wrote

    i long to see you you know it but
  it is enough to have the picture of this
  place imprinted on my own memory-

  i cant bear that you should see me
  here

   whatever your imagination shows
  you it cannot be as dreadful as the
  reality if i obtain my freedom i shall
  not feel that i have cheated justice
  heaven knows i could not pay more
  dearly for my crime than i have al-
  ready paid

  knowlton stubbornly refused to al-
low his lawyer to procure his release
on bail the lawyer said he was quix-
otic  dougherty used a stronger and
commoner term but they could not
change his decision he gave no rea-
sons but they understood and the
lawyer who was at least as scrupulous
as the average of his profession de-
clared to dumain that for the first
time in ten years practise he was de-
fending a guilty man with a clear con-
science

  as for the case itself it appeared to
be by no means simple the fact that
they had  knowledge of the evidence
held by the prosecution made them un-
easy and they bent their efforts main-
ly to attempts to discover its nature

  there was no danger they found
from red tim who had got away
safely the night before knowltons ar-
rest and he was the only one of the
gang whom knowlton had ever seen
or dealt with

 the evidence which the lawyer
feared most was that concerning any
specific operations and in relation to
the wallet which knowlton had missed
the day following the fight in du-
mains rooms knowlton suspected
sherman but thought it possible that
he had lost it on the street

   well said the attorney  the
best we can say is that were on our
guard we must keep our wits about
us and fight it out in the court-room
we wont know much about what they
know before the day of the trial its
her forbidden knight



a fight in the dark for us but remem-
ber they have to furnish the proof
dougherty was openly optimistic
after winning a one to thirty-five shot
on the number of knowltons cell-he
had recited the tale to the prisoner
with great gusto - he refused to be-
lieve that their efforts could possibly
culminate in anything short of glori-
ous victory

  think of it just think of it he
would say to knowlton in a tone
which partook of awe  he drew the
blooming number out of his hat-that
was the first shot then he plays it
single and wins-that was the second
why we cant lose well beat em
both ways from the middle

  thanks old man i hope so
knowlton would reply

  thus three weeks passed by and
found them marking time waiting for
the day of the trial dougherty spent
the better part of two days seeking for
sherman but without success they
had heard nothing from him save the
times he had accosted lila on the
street nor seen him since the morning
in lilas room

   hes surely round somewhere
said dougherty to dumain as they met
in the lobby one morning  in fact
i know hes in town because hes still
got that room on thirty-fourth street
but i cant get in and i cant get him
either going or coming

  the little frenchman shrugged his
shoulders and glanced across the lobby
where lila sat at her desk talking to a
man who had just approached--prob-
ably a customer

   bah let heem alone so long as
he ees not bother mees williams that
ees all we want

   its not all i want said dough-
erty  i want to punch his face and
i will hes a low-down dirty-

  he was interrupted by a call

   mr dumain  

  the voice was lilas they turned
she was standing in front of her desk
her face very white holding in her
hand a sheet of printed paper du-

main hurried over to her gave one
look at the paper which she thrust at
him with a trembling hand and called
to dougherty

  the ex-prizefighter crossed the
lobby

   what is it 

   look  dumain held the paper
before him  a what you call eet-
subpoena-for mees williams mon
dicu eet is all up 

   shut up growled dougherty ta-
king the subpoena  do you want the
whole lobby to know about it you
get excited too easy

   but what am i to do   faltered
lila

   be a sport dont let em floor
you with a little thing like this they
want you for a witness do they its
a good job id advise you to take it
lila gazed at him amazed at his
levity concerning what appeared to her
to be the destruction of all their plans

  dougherty read over the subpoena
with a smile

   the fact is said he  that im
surprised they didnt spring this be-
fore ive expected it all the time

   sherman knew all about your be-
ing at knowltons rooms-he told me
and dumain-and whats more he
told us that hed told the secret serv-
ice about you now why did they
hold off so long thats the only part
i dont like

   but what am i to do   lila re-
peated

   theres only one thing you can do
--go on the stand

  but mr dougherty dont you
see they will ask me about that
night and about the-the money and
he will be convicted

  dougherty appeared to be greatly
surprised

  and how so let em question
you from now till doomsday and what
will they find out simply that you
went straight home from the hotel and
spent the evening in your room read-
ing  pilgrims progress the only
one theyll have against you is sher-


the all-story magazine

man and if a jury wouldnt rather be-
lieve you than him im a liar

  still lila did not understand she
protested 

   but i didnt spend the evening in
my room

  dont you think i know it im
talking about evidence not facts as
far as the jurys concerned you did
lila gazed at him in horror

   do you mean id have to lie 
well thats a pretty strong word
said dougherty  but you can call it
that if you want to

  but i couldnt-i couldnt

   youll have to

  lila looked at him

   no i know i couldnt if i am
a witness and they ask me about -
that evening i couldnt tell them any-
thing but the truth-

  it was the tone rather than the
words that caused dougherty to force
back the protest that came to his lips
and convinced him of its uselessness

  here was an obstacle indeed and
utterly unexpected dougherty was
not up on feminine psychology and he
couldnt understand how a girl could
do for a man what lila had done on
the night of knowltons arrest and
then refuse to lie for him

   besides it would be useless lila
was saying  i think it was mr sher-
man who saw me but it may not have
been some of the others may have
seen me also and now i remember
the man they left in the room did see
me as i passed the door he might
not recognize me but how can we
know and if he did- 

   all right dougherty interrupted
 then theres no use talking about it
were in a he-were in a mess but
well find a way out somehow du-
main find driscoll and booth ill get
jennings leave it to us miss will-
iams dont you worry about that
thing  - pointing to the subpoena-
 for a minute hurry up dumain 
and ten minutes later the erring
knights five strong were assembled in
their corner holding a council of war

 over this new and dangerous compli-
 cation

   booth was ready to throw up the
 sponge

    whats the use   he demanded
  theyve got him fifty ways from
 breakfast and this thing finishes it
 if miss williams goes on the stand and
  tells what she knows he doesnt stand
 a chance

    you dont say  observed dough-
 erty ironically  whats the matter-
 cold feet  and what do you think
 were here for its up to us to fix it
 so that she dont go on the stand

    tell me one thing said driscoll
  why havent they arrested her 

    easy enough this from jen-
 nings  because if they did they
 couldnt force her to testify against
 knowlton and they couldnt force
 knowlton to testify against her they
 figure that one is better than none

    come on boys talk business
 dougherty pulled jennings down on
 the lounge and glared at booth  we
 have enough trouble as it is without
 trying to figure out why we havent got
 more

   but their wits refused to work no
 one had anything to suggest that was
 worth listening to unless it was dris-
 coll who was strongly in favor of
 avoiding the subpoena by the simple
 expedient of running away from it

    the trial is only four days off
 said he  convey miss williams to
 some safe and sheltered spot till its
 over and let knowlton join her there
  but then thered be a warrant out
 for her for contempt jennings ob-
 jected

    well you cant have everything
 retorted driscoll

   dougherty told them to wait a mo-
 ment and crossed the lobby to lilas
 desk soon he returned shaking his
 head negatively

    she wont do it he announced

    shes darned particular growled
 booth  what will she do  

   but the ex-prizefighter stood up for
 lila
her forbidden knight



   no you cant blame her she
looks at it different from us well
have to think up something else

  there was a silence driscoll light-
ed a cigarette offering one to each of
the others and soon the corner was
decorated with spirals of smoke fi-
nally dumain spoke for the first time

   i tell you said he  as soon as
you feenish this foolishness what i
will do you know nozzing i weel
ask siegel

   and what can he do   demanded
driscoll  hell want to fix up an
alibi for her and she wont stand for
it and then hell try to bully her

  but the others signified their ap-
proval of dumains suggestion es-
pecially dougherty and the little
frenchman was soon on his way down-
town to the attorneys office while
dougherty left for his daily visit to the
tombs

  driscoll strolled over to lilas desk
and told her that dumain had gone to
consult their lawyer

   but he cannot help us she fal-
tered  there is nothing i can do is
there mr driscoll tell me

   you can keep up your courage
returned the young man  as tom
would say be a sport and this siegel
is a shrewd man hell get us through
safely never fear dumain ought to
be back before noon

  but lila was completely terrified
and refused to be reassured the for-
mal phraseology of the subpoena had
impressed her with the power of the
law it seemed to her to smell of courts
and prisons and her womans mind
was affected more by the document it-
self than by the very real danger it
threatened

  throughout the remainder of the
morning she sat with her eyes glued
on the entrance to the lobby at eleven
oclock dougherty returned from the
tombs with a note from knowlton
but an hour later the little frenchman
had not arrived lila put on her hat
and coat to go to lunch with a heavy
heart

  the day was one of brilliant sun-
shine with a saucy freshening breeze
coming in from the bay lila ate little
and hurriedly then strolled along the
walks of madison square

  the grass plots were beginning to
turn green and the trees were covered
with brown damp buds and in the cen-
ter of the square a gardener was ra-
king the newly turned earth the
gladness of the approaching spring was
in the air

  lila found it intolerable she re-
turned to the lamartine

  dumain rushed to meet her as she
entered the door

   mees williams  ive been waiting
for you such a plan  zat lawyer ees
a genius 

  the lobby was accustomed to du-
main and paid little attention to his
gesticulations and shrill high-pitched
tones but lila flushed with embarrass-
ment as they walked to her desk she
felt that every one was in her secret
wherein she was unjust to the loyalty
and discretion of the erring knights

  but this was nothing to the deep
rich crimson that flooded her cheeks as
the little frenchman in low excited
tones unfolded to her the plan of
lawyer siegel and with it came a
smile curiously tender as dumain ex-
pressed a doubt as to her willingness to
act upon it

  he finished

   you see he dont know if you will
do eet and i am to telephone heem at
one oclock so eef he must-

   but i will said lila  oh i
will but are you sure i wont have
to testify are you sure 

   positeevely

   then - couldnt we do it to-day
instead of to-morrow 

   no dumain smiled  eet weel
take till to-morrow morning to get zee
bail for knowlton dougherty ees
down to see heem now to-morrow
afternoon eet will be-remember i
must go to see siegel for zee bonds-
man

  and he trotted off leaving lila with


the all-story magazine

face still flushed and the shadow of a
doubt in her eyes but with her lips
parted in a trembling wistful smile

  but the plan of lawyer siegel clever
and effective as it was nearly caused a
disruption in the ranks of the erring
knights

  for dumain and dougherty alone
were in the secret which they refused
to divulge and the three others strenu-
ously objected booth and jennings
threatened half in earnest to go over
to the prosecution and tell all they
knew while driscoll made many point-
ed and cutting remarks concerning the
source of the money they were using
but the little frenchman and the ex-
prizefighter were as adamant

   its miss williamss secret said
they  and it wouldnt be fair to her
to tell it the fact is she asked us
not to

  this last was not true but dougher-
ty knew they wouldnt ask lila

   and all were good for  suppose
is to sit round with our hands in our
pockets said driscoll bitterly this
was on the day after the plan had been
consummated  you get knowlton
out on bail and dont show up in the
lobby for a day at a time and when
you come back expect us to clap you on
the back and tell you how well we like
you its not a square deal

   now listen here said dougherty
 dont be a sore-head the trial is
day after to-morrow cant you wait
that long besides you fellows have
had your share youve been bringing
her to work every morning and taking
her home every evening and believe
me thats some job

   and heres another if knowlton
ets out-and lie will-theres going to
be a little dinner for him and lila in
dumains rooms friday evening the
trial cant last more than one day
well leave that dinner to you and
booth and jennings when dumain
comes in this afternoon hell give you
the keys to his flat and all the money
you need go as far as you like

   for how many 

   seven us five and them two
driscoll grunted and departed to
consult with booth and jennings

  on thursday evening the day be-
fore the trial miss williams was es-
corted to her home by dougherty him-
self she was depressed and nervous
and his repeated attempts to rally her
spirits were unsuccessful they dined
at a little restaurant on columbus
avenue and from there walked to one
hundred and fourth street

   brace up said dougherty as they
stopped at her door  this time to-
morrow night youll be ready to start
on your honeymoon dont you like
the idea  

   what do you think lie is doing
now  asked lila with apparent irrel-
evance she had learned to talk to
dougherty as to a chum

   reading your letters said the ex-
prizefighter with conviction  he al-
ways is and now you go up and get
to bed and sleep none of this endless
night business

  lila was standing in the open door
 ill try she promised smiling
 good night and thank you ill be
waiting for you in the morning

chapter xvii

the trial

   may it please your honor mr
foreman and gentlemen of the
jury-

  the speaker was a united states
assistant district attorney the scene a
federal court-room in the post-office
building on park row john knowl-
ton alleged counterfeiter was  trial
before twelve of his peers

  the room was old and dingy-the
building itself has been called the ug-
liest in new york the jury-box the
benches the railings were blackened
by time and use the clerk appeared to
have been fastened to his desk for many
years a dreary melancholy room

  the spectators benches are by no
means filled most of the faces are
her forbidden knight



familiar ones in a group at the right
are detective barretf and his two men
with billy sherman seated side by
side on the front row of benches are
driscoll booth dumain jennings and
dougherty toward the rear of the
room lila is seen and by her side-
mrs amanda berry there are some
dozen others - hangers-on sensation-
seekers and young lawyers

  knowlton who was seated by the
side of his attorney and engaged in
a whispered consultation with him
looked up quickly as the prosecuting
attorney rose to address the court and
jury the clock on the wall pointed to
half past eleven ninety minutes had
sufficed for the preliminaries including
the selection of the jury lawyer
siegel had proven extraordinarily easy
to please thereby earning the gratitude
of the judge

   may it please your honor mr
foreman and gentlemen of the jury-

  the assistant district attorney pro-
ceeded with his opening speech he
was a young fellow-perhaps eight and
twenty-and he spoke with the earnest
enthusiasm of youth with forceful
sounding phrases

  the prisoner felt his cheeks burn
more than once at their sting he
wound up with the assertion that he
would produce sufficient evidence to
convict ten times over

  lawyer siegel turned and whispered
to his client

   he didnt let anything out-hes a
slick one

  before knowlton could do more
than nod in response siegel had risen
to his feet and begun the opening
speech for the defense it was surpri-
singly short it entered not at all into
details or even the nature of his evi-
dence and amounted in fact to little
more than a general denial but as he
stated that the accused would not be
called to the stand in his own defense
knowlton perceived a swift almost im-
perceptible expression of doubt and
disapproval flit across the faces of the
jurors

  as siegel sat down the prisoner
turned for a fleeting glance at lila she
smiled at him brightly

  the prosecuting attorney called his
first witness

   james barrett 

  the detective had little to tell he
identified knowlton and gave an ac-
count of his arrest dwelling pointedly
on his flight to the rear of the flat as
they entered

  siegel for the defense did not cross-
examine

  the second witness for the prosecu-
tion was billy sherman

   what is your name  

   william sherman

   your business 

   journalist

   your address 

  he gave a number on west thirty-
fourth street

  there followed some questions con-
cerning the length of shermans ac-
quaintance with the prisoner and the
amount of time he had spent in his
company then the prosecuting attorney
asked

   did you ever see knowlton pass
or offer to pass counterfeit money
instantly siegel was on his feet with
an objection

   sustained said the judge

  this was the beginning of a battle
royal between the two lawyers time
and again the prosecuting attorney tried
to make his point approaching it from
every possible angle and time and again
siegel objected that the witness was
incompetent to answer

  finally the judge himself became im-
patient and addressed the assistant dis-
trict attorney with some severity

   mr brant this witness has not
qualified as an expert you must give
up this line of questioning or dismiss
him

  siegel seated himself with a tri-
umphant smile the prosecuting at-
torney frowned and cleared his throat
knowlton cast a glance over his shoul-
der at the spectators benches and sent
a smile to lila


the all-story magazine

 dougherty leaned over and whispered
 to driscoll

  i dont know what the deuce theyre
 talking about but that cagey little guy
 looks like hed just stopped a swing
 on the jaw and was hanging over the
 ropes

 but young mr brant had another
 cartridge in his belt he asked that an
 exception be noted on the ruling of the
 court then turned to the witness

  mr sherman where were you on
 the evening of the nth of december
 last 

  at the rooms of pierre dumain a
 palmist

  where are those rooms 

  in west twenty-first street

  what is the number  

  i dont know

  who was there with you 

  the defendant knowlton and four
 or five others

  what are the names of the oth-
 ers  

  tom dougherty pierre dumain
 bub driscoll sam booth and harry
 jennings

  what were you doing there  
 the witness hesitated a moment be-
 fore he answered

  having a fight you see-

 no answer my questions inter-
 rupted the lawyer  were you fight-
 ing

  no sir

  who was  

  knowlton and driscoll knowlton
 knocked him out

  and then 

  then knowlton and dougherty
 fought it lasted ten or fifteen minutes
 and-

  now tell the court and the jury
 exactly what happened

  well knowlton was getting the
 better of dougherty and had him up
 against the wall when all of a sudden
 somebody threw a piece of bronze or
 something at knowlton and hit him on
 the head he dropped like a shot
 then what did you do

  i ran over toward the door where

knowlton was lying on the floor and
so did the others as i was standing-
near him i saw a wallet sticking out
of his hip-pocket and i knew they-
 ou mean knowltons pocket 

   yes and i was afraid one of the
guys might take it so i stooped down
when no one was looking and pulled
it out of his pocket-it was nearly out
already-and put it in my own think-
ing to keep it for him dumain had
sent somebody-

  mr brand interrupted

   never mind the others what did
you do  

   i waited till the doctor came and
when he said knowltpns injury was
not serious i went home i believe
knowlton stayed at dumains rooms all
night when i got home i put his
wallet away-

   why didnt you return it to him
before you left dumains rooms 

   because lie was still half uncon-
scious he was in no condition to talk
to then the next afternoon i think
it was-

   arent you sure  

   yes said the witness after a mo-
ments hesitation  it was the next aft-
ernoon i took the wallet out of the
drawer where i had put it away think-
ing to take it round to knowltons
rooms and as i put it in my pocket
i happened to look into it just out of
curiosity and i nearly fell over when
 saw it was full of counterfeit-
lawyer siegel sprang to his feet

   i object on the ground that the
witness is incompetent

   sustained said the judge

   exception said mr brant

  the judge turned to the witness

   confine yourself to a recital of your
own actions

   did you return the wallet to
knowlton   asked the prosecuting at-
torney

  sherman answered   no sir

   what did you do with it 

   i kept it a while then i took it to
detective barrett of the secret serv-
ice
her forbidden knight



  the prosecuting attorney took some-
thing from a leather case on the desk
before him and handing it to the wit-
ness asked

   do you recognize that 

   yes said sherman  its the
wallet ive been talking about

   is it the one you took from knowl-
tons pocket

   yes sir

   inspect the contents are they the
same as when you first saw it 

  there was a pause while the witness
examined each of the compartments of
the wallet then he answered

   yes sir

   everything the same

   yes sir

  mr brant stepped forward and took
the wallet from sherman and handed
it to the clerk of the court

   your honor said he  i wish to
introduce this wallet as evidence with
its contents i shall call an expert later
to prove that they are counterfeit

  this was a blow to the defense
which though not entirely unexpected
appeared to be serious the erring
knights looked gloomily at each other
but forbore to speak

  lila was scarcely breathing in the
intensity of her anxiety while mrs
berry patted her hand soothingly the
accused was whispering excitedly to his
attorney who listened with keen inter-
est nodding his head with satisfaction
at intervals the result of this confer-
ence was to appear later

  the prosecuting attorney asked his
witness a few more questions for the
most part unimportant then turned
him over for cross-examination

  lawyer siegel rose to his feet he
had not an impressive appearance but
as he stepped directly in front of sher-
man he shot at him a glance so severe
and terrifying that the witness invol-
untarily recoiled

  the tone was no less severe

   how long did you keep this wallet
before you turned it over to detective
barrett 

  shermans answer was low

   about two months

   why 

  but mr brant objected to the ques-
tion and was sustained

  siegel resumed

   you say somebody hit knowlton
  on the head with  a piece of bronze or
  something who was it that threw
  that bronze  

  the witness was silent

   who was it  repeated the law-
yer

  sherman stammered

   i did

   i see had you been fighting with
him  

   no

  the attorney was shouting his ques-
tions with great rapidity giving the
witness barely time to answer and no
time at all to think sherman was
nervously grasping the arm of his
chair

   were you standing very close to
  knowlton when you threw the bronze
  at him   

   no sir

   across the room werent you 

   yes sir

   and as soon as he fell dumain and
  dougherty ran over and knelt down by
  him didnt thev 

   yes sir 

   and jennings stopped you when
  you started to leave the room didnt
  he 

   yes sir

  the questions were coming like the
  rattle of a gatling-gun

   and he forced you back to the
  corner 

   yes sir

   then he went to help the others
  with knowlton  

   yes sir

   you were over in the opposite cor-
  ner alone  

  yes sir

   and when you found the wallet
  was it in the coat or the vest 

   the coat

   which pocket 

   the insi- sherman began then


the all-story magazine

realizing suddenly what he was saying
stopped short with a look of horror

  he was trapped

  the reason for his previous story of
having taken the wallet from knowl-
tons hip-pocket as he lay on the floor
could be found only in the tortuous
channels of shermans treacherous
brain

  undoubtedly he had thought to
make his evidence stronger by making
it appear that the thing had actually
been taken from the person of the ac-
cused and had anticipated the diffi-
culty of proving that the coat was
knowltons and now he was fairly
caught

  siegel pursued his advantage relent-
lessly he hammered the witness with
questions and sherman stammered and
grew red in the face with helpless an-
ger and finally admitted that his first
story had been false that was all
siegel wanted he sat down with a
smile of triumph his forehead was
covered with beads of sweat

  on redirect examination the prose-
cuting attorney made a valiant attempt
to bring his witness out of the hole he
had digged for himself but in vain
sherman was hopelessly confused he
made matters worse instead of better
and ended by refusing to answer at all
he was dismissed by the court with a
reprimand and at a sign from mr
brant seated himself on the front row
of benches

  for a few moments the progress of
the trial was halted by a conference
between the prosecuting attorney and
detective barrett while knowlton
whispered animatedly to his counsel
and the faces of the erring knights
beamed with joy

   what did i tell you  said dough-
erty to driscoll sotto vocc  didnt i
say he was a slick guy 

  then the prosecuting attorney turned
to face the court-room 

   miss williams please take the
stand

  there was a silence no one moved
knowlton kept his eyes fastened on the

desk before him three of the erring
knights glanced accusingly at the other
two

  mr brant whose temper had not
been improved by the discrediting of
shermans testimony looked directly
at lila who had remained in her seat
and repeated his question

  will you please take the stand
  lila rose and faced him

   do you mean me  she asked

    es i called your name take
the stand

  lila did not move

   i beg your pardon but you did not
call my name

  arent you miss williams said
mr brant testily

  lila answered clearly

   no

  the attorney started with incredu-
lous surprise driscoll booth and
jennings looked round at her in amaze-
ment while dougherty and dumain
smiled in their superior knowledge
knowlton did not move

  sherman sprang from his seat and
crossing to the side of attorney brant
whispered excitedly

   thats her all right theyre up
to some trick call her up she wont
lie on the stand

  but mr brant shook him off and
after a moments hesitation again
spoke to lila  

   then what is your name 

  lila sent a single fleeting glance to
the prisoner who had turned in his
chair to face her then looked directly
at the questioner her answer was
low but distinct and half triumphant

   mrs john knowlton

  then she sat down and buried her
face in her hands and as everybody
stared at her in consternation sur-
prise or wonder lawyer siegel rose 
to his feet and addressed the listening
judge

   your honor this woman is the
wife of the accused and therefore
may not be called as a witness by the
prosecution your honor sees that she
is in distress may i ask that counsel
her forbidden knight



be instructed not to question her fur-
ther in court  

  but mr brant turned on him an-
grily 

 your proof show us your
proof 

   of course said the other taking
a paper from his portfolio  i expect-
ed you would demand it i do not ex-
pect courtesy from you sir he
handed the paper to the judge  that
is the marriage certificate your honor
there was a breathless silence
throughout the room while the judge
adjusted his eye-glasses and inspected
the large stamped document he
looked at the date and the signatures
and glanced at attorney siegel search-
ingly then turned to lila and asked
her to step to the witness-stand

   i object your honor- began
lawyer siegel but the judge stopped
him with a gesture

  lila was in the witness-chair the
clerk of the court administered the
oath the judge turned to her

   are you the  lila williams  men-
tioned in this certificate 

  lila barely glanced at it before an-
swering 

   yes sir

   are you the wife of the accused
john knowlton

   yes sir

   do you wish to testify for the peo-
ple in this action  

   yes sir

   that is all said the judge you
may go

  then as lila glanced at him grate-
fully and rose to return to her seat he
handed the certificate back to lawyer
siegel and turned to speak to the pros-
ecuting attorney with judicial calm-
ness 

   call your next witness mr brant
but the trial had become a farce a
huge joke - on the prosecution of
his two chief witnesses one had been
discredited and the other disqualified
and attorney brant stammered in an-
gry confusion that he had no others
he recalled sherman to the stand

     s

to give a xecital of lilas movements
as observed by him on the evening of
knowltons arrest but sherman could
tell little and it was easy to perceive
by the expression on the faces of the
jurors that the little he could tell was
not believed	v

  mr brant also called an expert who
testified that the bills in the wallet in
evidence for the prosecution were
counterfeit then the prosecution
rested

  the defense rested without calling
a witness

  then came the closing speeches
young mr brant stammered and
hesitated for a quarter of an hour and
considering the paucity of his material
made a very creditable effort but it
was thrown completely in the shade by
that of lawyer siegel which may be
given in full

   may it please your honor mr
foreman and gentlemen of the jury
without any desire to lie flippant i can
only state that since i am confined to
the evidence and since there has been
 evidence worth speaking of i have
nothing to say

  and five minutes later without leav-
ing their box the jury returned a
verdict of  not guilty and john
knowlton was a free man

  it was lila who reached his side
first but the erring knights were not
far behind and knowlton found him-
self the center of an excited laughing
group of faces filled with good-will and
friendship and - one of them - with
love

  in one of his hands he held both of
lilas and gave the other to each of
the erring knights in turn but his
lips were silent before all these faces
at that moment he could not trust him-
self to speak

   but i was so frightened lila was
saying  oh i was so frightened  
bah said dumain at what
madam  

  lilas cheek flushed at the title and
driscoll observing it put in mischiev-
ously 


the all-story magazine

  yes that really isnt very compli-
mentary to us mrs knowlton

   oh  said lila helplessly while
the flush deepened

   and now said dougherty
 wheres that guy siegel  i want to
ask him to come up to the dinner to-
night i wonder where- what 
look at that 

  he was pointing excitedly across the
room the others turned and saw billy
sherman being escorted to the door of
the court-room by two police officers in
uniform

   probably some of his friends ob-
served booth

   no said driscoll  its more like-
ly that little slip-up in his testimony
i believe they call it perjury

  at that moment siegel approached
the group

   come on he called gaily  theyre
going to clear the room and i guess
well be glad enough to go since we
dont have to leave any one behind
and by the way did you notice our
friend sherman  he seems to be
having a little trouble of his own they
just arrested him

   what is it  asked booth  per-
jury they certainly didnt lose much
time

   no it isnt that that was mere-
ly a lapse of memory they came from
the outside i didnt hear what they
said but from the expression of mr
shermans face i wouldnt be surprised
if it was murder we caught him pret-
tily didnt we 

  they had left the court-room and
were standing at the head of the stairs
in the corridor

   well lets forget him said dris-
coll  he was bound to hang himself
sooner or later maybe hes done it al-
ready come on-everybody

  they moved down the stairs and out
to the sidewalk chattering and laugh-
ing still nervous and ill at ease from
the restraint and anxiety of the court-
room

  lined up along the curb were three
big gray limousines

   now said dougherty stopping
in front of them in the tone of a
general marshaling his forces  heres
where we separate

  he pointed to the first of the limou-
sines  dumain you take this car with
knowlton and take him to your rooms
hell find there what he needs

  cant help it mrs knowlton its
only for an hour or two driscoll you
are to take mrs knowlton to one
hundred and fourth street and get
her trunk and bags the rest of you
come with me and remember six
oclock at dumains rooms no later
come on boys 

   but what- knowlton began

   listen here dougherty interrupt-
ed sternly  are you going to obey or-
ders or not hereafter mrs knowl-
ton can boss you its our turn to-day
in pretended fright knowlton turned
to lila and bade her an revoir with a
pressure of the hand then sprang into
the automobile beside dumain

   thats right said dougherty
 here you go mrs knowlton help
the lady in driscoll come on siegel
with us whats that yes you will
-come on  all ready boys  let er
go so-long  remember six oclock 

chapter xviii

westward iio 

  eight gilt chairs with embroidered
seats and backs surrounding a table
covered with snowy linen and shining
silver four diminutive swiss waiters
with quick eyes and silent feet roses
everywhere-on the mantel in vases on
the table clustered over the door red
and white candles-hundreds of them
-placed wherever there was an inch
of space to hold them such was the
scene prepared by bub driscoll and his
aids for the joy dinner in honor of mr
and mrs john knowlton in that apart-
ment on west twenty-first street
which we have seen twice before

  lila was escorted to the dining-room
on the arm of lawyer siegel after
her forbidden knight



an extended and heated controversy
among the erring knights as to which
of them should have that honor

  when it appeared that the matter
was apt to be argued till the dinner
was ruined siegel stepped in and set-
tled the question by offering his serv-
ices which were gladly accepted

   pierre dumain as host sat at one
end of the table  knowlton at the other
on one side was lila between dough-
erty and driscoll opposite them booth
jennings and siegel

   what a shame  said lila  pm
so excited i cant eat-

   driscoll observed 

   now thats just like a woman
for two months youve been as cool
and collected as a cake of ice while
youve had enough trouble to scare an
army and now that everythings over
and youre just at the beginning of a
lifelong siege of matrimonial boredom
youre so excited you cant eat 

    i never did a harder days work in
my life declared dougherty  and
im hungry like a bear what do you
call this driscoll pm no bridegroom
-i cant eat roses

  but he was promptly squelched by
the master of ceremonies and every-
body talked at once till the soup arrived

  never was gayer company lila was
at first a little embarrassed at finding
herself the eighth at a table with seven
men but that did not last long no
longer in fact than when dougherty
at the finish of the fish arose to his feet
to give an imitation of miss hughes
chewing gum powdering her face and
waiting on three customers at the same
time

   she never did declared lila
when she could speak for laughing
 thats a slander mr dougherty

  what exclaimed the ex-prize-
fighter  ill admit its not true to
life its too delicate and refined not
that i dont like her the venus is a
good sport and if theres any-
whats this

   sweetbreads in tambo shell
msieu murmured the waiter

  after which dougherty was silent--
and busy-for ten minutes

  then lawyer siegel related some of
his court experiences both humorous
and tragical and dumain described
the mysteries and secrets of the gentle
art of reading palms and jennings ex-
plained that his contract with mr
frohman would probably not be signed
till the following day and dougherty
described his first prizefight with an
animation and picturesqueness of lan-
guage that left the others in a condition
bordering on hysteria

   theres one thing said driscoll
turning to lila  for which i shall
never forgive you - that you didnt
invite me to the wedding

   plere too put in jennings  i
call it snobbish

  where was it anyway booth
wanted to know  how did you
manage it  

  dougherty explained

   easy you know we got knowl-
ton out on bail for one day well he
got a license and i got a preacher and
dumain let us use his french parlor
and stuff was all off in fifteen minutes
but you may get to see a wedding after
all

  dougherty glanced at knowlton
knowlton nodded then the ex-prize-
fighter continued

   we all know that our friend mr
knowlton is traveling sort of incog
plis real name is norton and that fact
demands what you might call supple-
mentary proceedings the big show is
on to-morrow and if you treat airs
knowlton right shes very apt to give
you a bid

   hurrah   shouted driscoll  in
at the death is all i ask

   what an expression  said lila
 mr driscoll im offended

   i beg your pardon said the gen-
tleman gallantly  i didnt mean it i
assure you waiter 

   yes sir

  if i order another bottle of white
wine-

   yes sir


the all-story magazine

   i say if i order more white
wine-

   yes sir

   dont bring it

   yes sir no sir

  the table grinned and made a con-
certed and valiant attack on the dessert
while jennings and booth accused each
other with some heat of being the cause
of driscolls order

  presently driscoll rapped on the
table for attention and glared fiercely
at the disputants till he got it

   lady and gentlemen said he  i
must ask your kind favor and indul-
gence unlike-the rest of this proud
assembly mr jennings and myself are
workingmen we earn our bread by
toil

  cries of  hear hear  came from
jennings while the others jeered

   howbeit continued the speaker
silencing the interruptions with an im-
perious gesture  we must be at our
tasks by eight oclock it is now seven-
twenty

   i understand that mr dumain has
a surprise in store for us and that mr
knowlton has kindly consented to
make a speech in the interests of
equality and justice i demand that
these ceremonies begin at once

  applause continued and vocifer-
ous from jennings booth and siegel
each grasped xne of his arms and held
him quiet driscoll turned to dumain
and demanded an answer

   all right said the little french-
man ifm ready

  what about it driscoll turned
to the others

  they signified their approval
knowlton who had been silent
throughout the dinner nodded du-
main rose to his feet pushed back his
chair and cleared his throat

   about zee surprise the little
frenchman began  eet ees a pleasant
surprise we are here this evening-
 hear hear murmured jennings
silence him ordered driscoll
booth and siegel obeyed and the
speaker continued

   i say we are here this evening be-
cause our hearts are glad for our
friend mr knowlton and our very
dear lady-god bless her-zee lady
lila

   to her  shouted dougherty
springing to his feet and raising his
glass on high

   to lady lila  came in a deafen-
ing chorus while lila rose to her feet
trembling and confused

  they drank the toast amid cheers
and applause

   and now continued dumain
when they had reseated themselves
 for zee surprise i must go back a
leetle and i do not speak zee angleesh
so well so you must have zee patience

   about knowlton eet ees-only

  dumain paused glanced at his audi-
ence with the assurance of a man who
holds a high trump and continued

her forbidden knight



  he took a yellow telegraph-form
from his pocket and waved it in the
air it was extra size-the telegram
was a long one

  they shouted  read it 

  but dumain tossed it to knowlton
who after reading it through let it
fall from his hands to the table and
turned a white face to lila

  what is it lila faltered
dougherty snatched up the telegram
and read it aloud

    mr john norton hotel lamar-
  tine new york alma sherman has
  confessed all i was a fool not to be-
  lieve you but come home her
  brother got the money they have
  wired to the new york police come
  home at once letter follows but
  dont wait for it wire me immedi-
  ately

                              father

   oh   cried lila  and now -
and now--

  in the confusion that followed
while the others applauded and shout-
ed and clapped knowlton on the back
dougherty had to place his mouth
close to her ear to make her hear

   and now what  he demanded

   and now lila answered  he-
he doesnt need me after all

  the ex-prizefighter sprang to his
feet

   ha  he cried in a tone of thun-
der silence shut up you
knowlton do you know what your
wife is saying she says that now
you wont need her 

  another moment and knowlton was
at her side holding her in his arms

  lila dear little girl we shall
go home-home-together darling
not need you look at me 

  for the next five minutes the erring
knights and lawyer siegel were oa-
cupied in the next room chased there-
to by dougherty who commanded
them to make as much noise as possi-
ble

  presently knowltonsvoice came 

   come back here what are you
doing in there ii say dumain
dougherty 

  they came through the door back-
ward in single file and lila was
forced to laugh in spite of herself

   thats better said dougherty ap-
provingly  this is an occasion of
joy mrs knowlton no tears al-
lowed

  lila smiled at him

  but say put in driscoll as he
lit a cigarette - lila had long since
commanded them to smoke- do you
know what  thats what they took
sherman for at the court-room 

   they didnt waste any time
booth observed

   oh i know how he knew that
lila was saying to knowlton and du-
main who had expressed their wonder
at his fathers knowledge of his ad-
dress  it was mr sherman who
told him

   sherman  they exclaimed

   yes lila asserted

  then she told them of the telegram
sherman had sent to the president of
the warton national bank concerning
john norton and dumain and knowl-
ton hastened to inform the others of
the fact that they owed the receipt of
the telegram to the enemy himself
thereby doubling their joyous hilarity

 then they surrounded knowlton
and demanded a speech he protest-
ed they insisted he appealed to
lila for assistance she commanded
him to do his duty

  there was no escape he motioned
them to be seated and began

   boys i know this is no time to be
serious-for you youre having a
good time but youve asked me to
talk and to tell the truth im glad of
the chance to relieve my mind if you
dont like what i say its your own
fault i know youre good sports but
there are one or two things ii have to
speak about

   first money youve spent about
sixteen hundred dollars on my defense
and youve given me a thousand for a
stake theres been nothing said
about it-youve turned it over to me
without a word - but i want you to


the all-story magazine

know that the first thing ill do when
i get home-when we get home-is to
send you a check for the twenty-six
hundred now dont think im refu-
sing a favor it isnt that the lord
knows ive accepted enough favors
from you avithout your insisting on
that one too

   oh of course if youre rolling in
wealth- put in driscoll

   then thats settled im not going
to try to thank you if i talked all
night i couldnt make it strong enough
lila and i are going out west where
they like to say you find nothing but
good clean americans and ive al-
ways thought the boast was justified
but wherever we go and whoever we
see well never meet as good men or as
straight sports or as true friends as
the erring knights

   heres to you boys god bless
you 

  knowltons voice was trembling so
that he could scarcely speak and his
eyes shone with tears as he drained the
glass and threw it on the floor where
it broke in a thousand fragments

  the following afternoon the bride
and groom were escorted to the grand
central station by the erring knights
and there they received their re-
ward if they had felt they needed any
for after knowlton had shaken hands
with each of them and arranged for a
grand reunion when he and his wife
should next visit new york as they
stood lined up at the entrance to the
trackway lila approached dougherty
who happened to be first with a fare-
well on her lips

  he held out his hand she ignored
it and stretching on tiptoe placed a
hearty uncompromising kiss on his
either cheek and before he could re-
cover she had passed on to dumain
and repeated the operation and then
to the remaining three

  in another moment she was walking
down the platform by the side of the
train with her arm through that of her

thi

husband preceded by two porters load-
ed with bags and suit-cases and flowers
and candy and every now and then she
turned to look back at the erring
knights who were waving their hand-
kerchiefs frantically in unrestrained
and triumphant glee and then throw-
ing a last kiss from the car platform
while knowlton waved his hat they dis-
appeared inside and a minute later the
train pulled out

   it happened by a curious coincidence
that that train held two sets of passen-
gers for the little town of warton
ohio

   in a day-coach seated side by side
were two men the face of one dark
and evil looking wore lines of sleepless-
ness and despair and fear the other a
small heavy-set man with a ruddy coun-
tenance was seated next the aisle and
had an appearance of watchfulness as
he kept one eye on his companion while
he scanned the columns of a newspaper
with the other william sherman was
going home to pay

   but a few feet away in a pullman
sat the man he had tried to ruin and
the girl he had tried to wrong

   they were looking at each other they
felt almost for the first time between
them on the seat their hands were
closely clasped together

   thus they sat for many minutes si-
lent while the train passed through the
city crossed to the west and started
on its journey northward along the
banks of the glorious hudson

    dearest said the man in a caress-
ing tone

   the girl pressed his hand tighter and
sighed happily

   theyre good fellows the man
continued  every one of them and
to think what we owe them every-
thing-everything 

    yes said the girl  everything
we must never forget them

   but the truth was as avas clearly ap-
parent from the tone of her aoice and
the melting of her eyes into his that
she had forgotten them already

yp had no particular objections
  to being abducted hed been
  abducted before

  thats because he was a yellow dog
of anonymous pedigree and yellow
dogs of that kind have been considered
more or less common property since
the world began

  so when big bill of the reno mu-
sical comedy company caught him at
the back of charlie sandss hot-dog
wagon in topeka and brought him
along as an addition to the company
there were no objections from gyp
the only objections came from the
said charlie sands owner of the said
hot-dog wagon

  charlie was also a member of the
company and it was his duty by vir-
tue of his occupation to look after the
companys live stock which consisted
entirely of dogs actresses in stock
companies have a failing for dogs
and there were eight already and gyp
made nine

  charlie would have struck openly if
he had dared but big bill had a way
of getting things he wanted so gyp
started for texas

  gyp was fond of charlie for ma-
terial reasons this had no effect on

charlies animosity which rather in-
creased with better acquaintance and
became a matter of comment to the
other members of the company

  therefore when gyp was uncere-
moniously kicked off the back plat-
form of the moving train some three
miles out of alamogordo the only one
who was surprised was gyp

  gyp rolled like a ball for a dozen
yards in the soft sand and then got
up and shook himself he ran after
the receding train a while and barked
but without effect then he sat down
to inspect the country and being a
philosopher forgot about the train

  a topeka dog suddenly dropped in
the middle of a new mexico desert
finds lots of new things to interest
him

  the first new thing was a jack-rab-
bit which jumped up right in front of
him it looked strange but it ran and
so gyp pursued it this was good
sport but discouraging especially if
one is not accustomed to breathing in
a high altitude and after a few miles
he gave it up

  he jumped at lizards till dark
which is less fatiguing if less exci-
ting then he curled up under a soap-

the all-story magazine

weed and slept till daylight on an
empty stomach which is literal

  he awoke to find a coyote watching
him suspiciously gyp was very hun-
gry but he doubted if coyotes were
good eating he growled and bristled
hoping the thing would run away

  it didnt so gyp left it trying to
appear dignified and not to hurry
after half a mile he dared to look
back thank goodness the thing
wasnt following him

  in the distance he caught sight of
the roofs of alamogordo shining
through the mesquit he instantly
connected houses with food for he
was very hungry and he started for
them the desert was no place for a
tenderfoot

  on the way in he could not resist
chasing one more jack-rabbit he
knew it was useless but it ran from
him and he needed something to make
him feel brave after the episode of the
coyote he thought his wind acted
better this time but it made his hun-
ger simply frightful

  after this he went straight only
stopping to wonder at a flock of moun-
tain quail they also ran from him
and he estimated that they were not
as fast as a rabbit but he knew birds
and let them go like as not the mean
things would start to fly the minute he
caught up to them

  that town was a good deal farther
off than he had thought but at last
he reached cultivated land and got a
drink out of a ditch

  there were a lot of these ditches
and some of them had leaked over
whole fields wherever a ditch had
leaked the desert had stopped this
interested gyp but he didnt under-
stand it

  he didnt bother much with the
farms they all had dogs and gyp
knew that one dog to a family was
usually enough only stock compa-
nies went in for dogs in quantities so
he kept right on until he reached the
main street of the town

  there were trees on this street and

it was cool and quiet and had familiar
smells then one delicious smell float-
ed down and blotted out all the rest
gyp raised his head and sniffed in
pleasurable anticipation

  im not sure that the phrase  to fol-
low ones nose  was invented to ap-
ply to yellow dogs but it is certain
that it was more than a motto to gyp
-it was the law of life

  gyp followed his nose and in a few
minutes was enjoying a feast of the
vision through the half-open door of
mr wiggles bakery

  mr wiggle was a large man in
every direction - the size you always
expect in a good cook or a good baker
and mr wiggle was a german and
a good baker

  gyp loved him at sight he always
loved bakers-it  was his religion
when he was a puppy his mother had
told him that if he was good he might
some day be the dog of a baker moth-
ers of puppies have a habit of doing
this the same as mothers of boys tell-
ing them that they may some day be
president

  mr wiggle with sleeves rolled
high was stirring rich dark dough
with the arm of a smith gyp watched
entranced with slowly wagging tail

  mr wiggle suspended operations
to inspect the oven through the door
gyp caught sight of billows and bil-
lows of fresh bread a thumb test
proved satisfactory and the pans of
bread were removed by means of a
broad wooden paddle on the end of a
long pole-over three hundred loaves
each loaf looking as if it had been es-
pecially baked for a competition

  the motion of gyps tail was per-
ceptibly increased

  the bread was deposited in tiers on
the scoured pine shelves and mr
wiggle turned again to the dark-brown
dough satisfied with its consistency
at last a hunk was rolled into a long
sausage and this was pinched into
pieces as big as plums by the thumb
and forefinger as rapidly and accu-
rately as if by machine
dogs luck



  then taking- a piece in each hand
mr wiggle rounded them by the sim-
ple method of rolling them on his tight
white apron over that part of the
anatomy which gave them their name
 belly-rubs the more proper and
perhaps better known name is circus-
cakes for though they go into the oven
round they come out flat and crisp and
familiar deeply veined and irresistible

  gyp still unobserved watched every
movement the pans were filled and
went into the oven on the same long
paddle that had removed the bread

  in a surprisingly short time they
were done and the pans were cooling
on the floor while the aroma of fresh
circus-cakes flooded the bakery floated
out of the shop and up and down the
quiet street threatening to attract all
who passed to the half-open door

  gyps tail was working furiously
now so that there seemed danger of its
flying off by centrifugal force two
other dogs joined him-fat well-fed
family dogs who came merely for the
smell as a sort of substitute for the
after-dinner cigar

  but if the local dogs could be satisfied
with the smell this was not the case
with gyp even the fresh  weenies 
at charlie sandss hot-dog cart had
never tempted him thus gyp was pre-
pared to sell his reputation for honesty
for one of those fresh cakes but then
gyps reputation for honesty where
food was concerned was never worth
very much

  the opportunity came and gyp with
the quick instincts of vagrancy ob-
served it mr wiggle looked at his
work and saw that it was good then
he turned to the water-pail with its long-
handled iron dipper for baking is
thirsty business

  in an instant gyp was through the
door the two local dogs watched him
-first with astonishment then with
pity-but gyp heeded them not

  at the edge of the nearest pan gyp
turned for a quick look at mr wiggle
at that same moment mr wiggle
chanced to glance down from his dipper

he caught gyps eye with understand-
ing the j ig was up 

  if gyp had departed then it is likely
that he would have gotten safely away
for he could move like a thought when
necessary but the intoxication for
circus-cakes was upon him he made
one frantic grab caught one in his
teeth and started for the door

  that extra second was gyps un-
doing the iron dipper with the long
handle started flying through the air
accompanied by the expressive word
 git 

  gyp was  gitting  as fast as he
knew how but as he reached the door
something struck his hind leg he
dropped his precious circus-cake with a
yell of pain and hurtled out into the
street

  the two local dogs had retired to a
safe distance and watched the exit with
amused  i told you so  expressions
they had learned their lessons long be-
fore and felt superior

  poor gyp got across the street on
three legs and hid behind some iron
roofing piled against the fence he had
stopped yelping when he reached cover
but his hind leg hung down and pained
him terribly he leaned over and be-
gan to lick with caution where the bone
turned an unnatural angle it was
broken

  when mr wiggle reached the door
gyp was nowhere to be seen this was
not a new game for him-the game of
a dog and the cakes and the iron dipper
-the door would get left open and the
odors of his wares were most inviting

  but mr wiggle was a kindly man
and bore no malice he looked upon
the disciplining of dogs much the same
as on the disciplining of children-a
disagreeable task but for their own
good and not a protest against their
existence

  when he hit the mark with the dip-
per he would throw out a cake as a
tentative peace-offering knowing from
experience that it would in no way
detract from the moral effect of the
lesson now the cake that gyp had


the all-story magazine

 dropped was tossed into the street and
 promptly eaten by one of the well-fed
 local dogs

    mr wiggle picked tip his dipper and
 returned to his work well pleased
 which would not have been the case
 had he known of the pitiful yellow dog
 behind the iron roofing nearly starved
 and nursing a broken leg

   poor gyp was discouraged he had
 been hurt before many times by kicks
 and stones and sticks and in twenty
 fights with dogs and one-only one-
 with a cat

   with bites and bruises he was famil-
 iar but this was different - it hurt
 more and made his leg queer and use-
 less-and in his dog mind he knew this
 was serious even to such a confirmed
 optimist as he was by nature the future
 looked black

   nobody loved a yellow dog - no-
 body cared whether he lived or not
 if he should venture forth now in
 broad daylight some one would shoot
 him pie remembered seeing a dog
 that had been hit by an automobile
 and his hind leg had dragged in the
 same way and a man had shot him
 and a lot of ladies in the automobile
 had said it was a good thing because
 it put him out of his suffering

   gyp was suffering now more than
 he had ever thought it possible to suf-
  fer but it never occurred to him to
 go out in hope that some one would
 shoot him nobody had ever told him
 about the happy hunting-ground in
 the hereafter and death held no pros-
 pects  he stayed out of sight and suf-
 fered and starved

   somewhere there is a story told of
 a man whose punishment for sin in
 this world is to suffer from thirst
 through eternity though up to- his chin
 in water we gasp with horror at the
 picture this brings before us

   there are tales aplenty of men who
 have starved in sight of most tempting
 eatables placed just out of reach by
 inhuman torturers again we shudder

    now picture to yourself a little yel-
 low dog between a fence and a piece

of iron roofing nursing a broken leg
and starving-actually starving-while
from across the street floats the fra-
grance of fresh bread and cakes and
doughnuts-everything that can make
a dogs life worth while

  gyp tried to doze but the pain made
that impossible so he lay still and
suffered and listened

  four oclock struck and school let
out disgorging its swarm of children
in all directions like sparks from a
pin wheel

  then five oclock came and he heard
mr wiggle close his shop for the
night and go into his house which
was built adjoining the bakery con-
nected by an inner door

  at six the sound of a phonograph
came faintly from the front parlor
mr wiggle was enjoying his well-
earned relaxation to the tune of a gen-
uine german band

  now enter bill wiggle mr wig-
gles sturdy tow-headed son

  bill was nine and his ambition in
life was to become a professional ball-
player his left hand was decorated
with the regulation twenty-five-cent
mitt and in his right hand he scien-
tifically thumbed the regulation twen-
ty-five-cent ball he had finished his
supper and was out for a few minutes
pitching practise before going to bed

  he looked up the street and down
the street in search of a catcher but
no catcher was to be seen this was
disappointing but bill also was an op-
timist

  the solid adobe wall of the bakery
would make a fine back-stop and the
rebound of the ball would be more
saving of time than the returns from
the catcher

  with a piece of white chalk he en-
circled a portion of the wall sufficient
in his estimation to equal the strike
zone then he withdrew the regula-
tion distance for the game of three-
old-cat balanced professionally on one
foot for a moment and shot one of
his famous out - drops at the white
circle
dogs

luck



  why that particular out-drop failed
to drop bill never understood cer-
tainly he held it the way so clearly ex-
plained in the boys baseball guide
which he had in his pocket at the time
held it the way he always held an out-
drop threw it the same way and wait-
ed confidently for the result

  there was no doubt that he had the
out-twist correct-the ball started on
an out and kept going out farther and
farther until it struck but instead of
a drop that perverse twenty-five-center
took a distinct rise

  when it struck it went neatly
through a pane of one of the bakery
windows some fifteen feet from the
white circle

  bill wiggle looked incredulously at
the broken pane was it possible that
he could have made a shot like that

  he looked around-the street was
empty-no one else could have thrown
the ball from the distant front par-
lor came the strains of a german band
--evidently mr wiggle had not been
disturbed

  at that moment bill unconsciously
blessed the inventor of german bands
should he run in and tell his father
what had happened this would be
hard to do for mr wiggle was not
interested in the science of the out-
drop and bill knew from experience
that there would be little sympathy
he knew also that his father consid-
ered the disciplining of children as
necessary as the disciplining of dogs
though disagreeable

  then why take this time to confess
when mr wiggle was enjoying him-
self it would spoil both their eve-
nings it would be much better for
everybody to wait until morning

  but billy must get his ball to leave
the ball there over night would be the
height of folly near the window stood
a large upright piano-crate

  it had been there a long time ever
since the piano had come-for mr
wiggle had not yet decided whether to
merely rent the piano or buy it if
billy could turn it over once it would

easily reach to the middle of the
window

  he tried-it was not heavy-he
turned it now to get on top it was
high and hollow and to shin up would
make too much noise

  near-by was a pile of long two-by-
four planks bill raised the end of one
and was able to place it on top of the
piano-case then he walked quickly up
the inclined plane unlatched the win-
dow by putting his hand through the
hole made by the ball carefully lowered
the upper half stepped through to the
sill inside felt his way round a table
piled high with empty pans and discov-
ered the ball in the middle of the floor

  back he climbed and the trick was
done

  so far so good but it would never
do to leave a big hole in the window all
night the night was full of cats and
they could climb and a cat in the bakery
was something bill knew his father
could not stand a short way clown the
street near the lumber-yard bill re-
membered having seen an old pair of
trousers and they might be there still

  luck was with him again and he
found them they were weak with
age and he was able to tear out a gen-
erous piece-a piece that contained the
two rear suspender buttons and most
of the seat

  he returned to the top of the crate
and leaning over the window-frame
tucked the cloth in the jagged hole
the window had a spring lock and
would fasten itself when raised

  suddenly bill stopped and listened
there sounded a heavy tread on the
other side of the connecting door-the
german-band side

   hi git out of there  

  there was no doubt about it it
was his fathers voice the command
was strange considering the circum-
stances but bill knew better than to
disobey he had been told to git and
he got

  down the inclined plane he dashed
and round the house and then not
being pursued he decided that he was


the all-story magazine

tired and would go to bed and there
await whatever might happen

  gyp woke about midnight with a
fierce aching in his leg with con-
sciousness came hunger and he real-
ized that he must eat to live and eat
immediately

  painfully he dragged himself from
behind the roofing and sniffed at the
night opposite was the bakery and
from an open window came a faint
smell of circus-cake

  in front of the window was a big
box with a board leading to the top
gyp went to investigate and soon
found himself on top of the box peer-
ing into the blackness of the room be-
low

  the smell of circus-cake was strong
and weakly a little tail began to wag
gyp felt over the edge with one foot
it landed on a bunch of cloth grasp-
ing the cloth with his teeth he let him-
self over the pain in his leg almost
making him yelp as it bumped against
the edge

  he was hanging now and in a mo-
ment he would be on the sill below and
then-

  and then the cloth he was biting
loosened and came out and he fell
backward striking a pile of pans
down he went and rattle bang bang
came the pans on top of him

  mine goodness cried mr wig-
gle and was half-way down the stairs
a revolver in one hand and a pillow in
the other before the last pan fell

  mrs wiggle stopped to- light a can-
dle and then followed as fast as she
could with the result that the candle
went out promptly and delayed matters

  they found the bakery empty save
for a little yellow dog with a broken
leg stunned beneath a pile of pans
tightly gripped in the little dogs teeth
was most of the seat of an old pair of
trousers

  the window was open wide a pane
of glass was broken and a box was
pushed conveniently outside mr
wiggle looked at everything carefully
and drew his own conclusions

  mine goodness he said again
robbers und all from the bank--
und in the safe- mine goodness  

  and mrs wiggle took gyp in her
arms and cried a little because she
was frightened and gyp recovered
and licked her face to show that every-
thing was all right

  and while mr wiggle was removing
two heavy bags from the old-fashioned
safe in the hall to a safer though more
uncomfortable position under his pil-
low mrs wiggle filled a big bowl with
bread and milk which certainly looked
good to gyp

  she was a clever woman and set the
broken bone and bound it securely in
splints while gyp was eating a warm
bed was made out of a clothes-basket
and an old blanket and a cushion and
gyp was left in the front parlor

   martin said mrs wiggle when
she was alone with her husband

 promise not to tell billy about the
burglars the poor lamb would be
frightened and not dare to sleep alone
and be troubled with dreams

  mr wiggle like the dutiful husband
he was promised

  bill got up in the morning with a
feeling that something was coming to
him but his joy on discovering that
the family had at last adopted a real
dog did much to make him forget his
fear

  when the day passed and the next
and no mention was made of the bro-
ken glass bill believed that a miracle
had happened and that gyp was re-
sponsible he might have brought up
the subject himself but it was a dis-
agreeable thing to talk about and the
boys guide to baseball was really to
blame and after all why should he

  gyp accepted his new position with
his usual philosophy as a fitting retri- 
bution for the broken leg

  sleek and fat and the constant com-
panion of the best pitcher for his age
in the country he became an object
of envy to all the local dogs

  he certainly had had a streak of
dogs luck 
all-story table-talk

a question of pride

we have been looking through the all - stories that have come out
during the last twelve months and for one reason or another have
become fairly swollen with pride

     even though pride is one of the seven deadly sins in this case we feel it to
be defensible for after all we are not proud so much of our work in the matter
as we are of the entertaining stuff we have got hold of

    for instance if you will consider the list of complete novels we have run
throughout  you will see there has been some pretty nifty reading hand-
ed to you

    the list is something as follows

   in january we printed  sands o life by william patterson
white in february the second man by lee robinet in march
the brain blight by jack harrower in april cowards
all by william tillinghast eldridge in may  barstows wife
by robert simpson in june the black comet by j earl clauson
in july angel citizens by william patterson white in august
the devil afloat by chauncey c hotchkiss in september the
copper princess by perley poore sheehan in october the
invisible empire by stephen chalmers in november a man
without a soul by edgar rice burroughs and this month a
thieves comedy by simeon robertson

    if you have traveled along avith these stories you have come very close to
circling the globe for you have been in china peru in the malay archi-
pelago in the caribbean on the west coast of africa in england in the great
northwest amid the rockies and in new york

    whats the use of paying out great wads of money for a avorlds tour avhen
you may so simply and easily make the grand tour aboard the good ship all-
story in the company of youthful pirates famous doctors famous detectives
beautiful women cowboys seafarers adventurers emperors and princesses

    it seems to us that no better company could be desired and ave believe if
you avill continue the sail with us you will meet a company as cheerful and as
unusual as you have played avith during this last year

    we feel that after so full an explanation our apparent pride and lack of
modesty will be easily condoned we hope that you feel more or less the same
way ave do and that our voyage together will be uninterrupted and practically
avithout termination

the all-aboard bugle

    our  cruise is about to begin

    all the cargo is aboard and already they are casting off we suppose
then it behooves us to tell the passengers a little of the trip they are about to
make-not too much for fear there would be no surprise in store for them
but just enough to pique their curiosity

     therefore let s say that our first great point of interest in january will
be the complete noarel which goes by the name of

                                              


the all-story magazine

the outsider

and which was written by j earl clauson here is a story of long and bitter
nights amid the ice of the arctic circle here is an american girl who finds her-
self forsaken in a tribe of eskimos how the gloom of the night is changed
to the glory of the day and how protection comes to this girl from a young
red-heacled giant and what becomes of the love of the two of them is the basis
of mr clausons yarn

     besides this he has given us a series of thrills and a catalogue of adven-
tures that are away out of the ordinary he has written brilliantly of the north-
land and sympathetically of those perhaps unfortunate folks who were born
there and who spend their days in the glare of ancient ice this is a strong
story and has appeal for both men and women for the girl in the yarn is very
very human

     there is going to be a new serial of course in january and it is written
by a san francisco man named charles c dobie and is about a sophisticated
people it is called

a nights harvest

and as a contrast to mr clausons yarn it serves splendidly the oppression
of convention the strength of scandal and the lastingness of devotion are the
points mr dobie makes he has a cast of only six characters-three men and
three women-but each stands for a class in american social conditions and
they work out their individual destinies according to the class to which each
belongs

     we are sure you will find this an engrossing novel because it is very true
to life and because it is very sympathetic

     the warlord of mars  will of course continue you will find
the story getting better and better as it goes along it certainly is a sockdolo-
ger and then there will be continuations of  the holse of sor-
cery  and  nothing but the truth

    there are going to be a number of short stories too by various people
including frank leon smith jack brant and donald a kahn

    so you may rest assured that we shall start out on this much-talked-of
trip of ours with plenty of interest and plenty of geniality

your old numbers containing just like	dear sir

wyoming  forest reaper  prince im- most fiction magazines are interesting
all-story table-talk



and are entertaining when time is heavy
on ones hands but once read and they
are trash the all-story is different
when you read a story like  sands o
life or  the invisible empire you do
not want to throw that away

  the all-story you read carefully
save and reread here it is that one finds
favorites better with every reading one
who takes the all-story has a perpetu-
ally increasing library of entertaining
wholesome fiction

  there is much difference between things
that are  cheap  and things that are
 trash poes  raven  was sold cheap
--but it was not trash 

  certain magazines print  daring sen-
sational stories they are trash-but they
are not cheap  the average popular fic-
tion magazine-it is trash and cheap the
all-story is of the  raven  class-
cheap but not trash

  to one who has read several numbers
of the all-story it has a certain charm
and one  gets the habit -a desire that
no other magazine can satisfy

  some seem to think that the sensational
is low class

   gods of mars  and  the moons of
mars  are no more trash than jules
vernes stories if  tarzan of the apes
is trash so are kipling and doyle bur-
roughs and verne burroughs and kipling

  i agree with h r b and l c in the
october number - get mr burroughs to
give us a series f john carters adven-
tures on other planets tarzan was great

  give us plenty of scientific and impossi-
ble stories  the brain blight  the
copper princess  the gods of mars
 lure of gold  star dust and  the
black comet  were great

  also give us more wild adventure like
 sands o life  the invisible em-
pire  the savage and  on the trail
of an emperor  were all great

  give us sequels to  the copper prin-
cess  and  gods of mars will you
please tell me in what number  under the
moons of mars began why not con-
tinue the volume index to aid in locating
stories and securing missing numbers

an original liar

  this is from a reader who travels all
over the united states where god placed
coal and man digs it and who in the course
of fourteen years has seen many wonder-
ful things and horrible things happen miles
under the ground where the sun never
shines

  i cannot see why burroughs has over-
looked the coal-mine as a field for his won-
derful creations

  as an original liar he is supreme and
my greatest pleasure is in wondering if he
is really sane

  i insist upon your making the all-
story a two-a-month publication its too
darn long to wait and it seems as though
enough of your readers have asked this to
receive at least an excuse as to why not

  if you have a reasonable excuse lets
hear it if not we want and will have a

strated by the cover design illustrating an
incident in  the copper princess  in the
september issue of the all-story your
covers should certainly lack nothing in

  i want to compliment you on  the in-
visible empire it was ace-high i was
almost sorry it was not a serial story that
i might have enjoyed the suspense and an-
ticipation of the sequel cant you induce
mr chalmers to write a story of ancient
egypt 

 the copper princess was immense

i feel sure your readers would like to hear
more of the incast i had an almost irre-
sistible impulse to visit the museum of
natural history and ask to be shown
 our  copper princess

  if mr burroughs does not leave john
carter and his bride in a safe position at
the conclusion of his next mars story i
will appeal to the rest of your readers for
entrants to an expedition to save both of
them

  with best wishes for a continued run
of your good stories

ghosts and weird happenings

london england

dear editor 

  am hurrying this through to you with the
suggestion that the december all-story
should be a double number after the
fashion of our english magazines fail-
ing this give s such a treat to commence
the new year with you will have ap-
preciative remarks from all your readers
and you must have plenty of reading mat-
ter to absolutely satisfy all tastes

  in the october number of the good old
magazine i c d asks for something
 creepy i am in accord

  how many times have i crept up to the
room of sleep with hair raised and nerves 
galore when such yarns have been running
in your earlier numbers

  remember the circular staircase
yes let us have some  ghosts haunted
rooms weird happenings ct cctcra what
could be more seasonable for the winter
editions 

  glad to have secured you a couple of
new readers

  excuse such a long epistle but think it
over

  the story  pilgrims in love in your
october issue is a very sweet dainty story
of orientalism that should appeal to any
reader of fiction

  mr de lysle f cass is to be compli-
mented on the diplomatic way he has han-
dled a very difficult subject-oriental love

  hope to see more of his work in the

startling exclusive improvements

step starter - selective two-speed - double
- folding foot boards - ful-floteing

nphe harley-davidson models for  are marked for the innova-
tions they present innovations but not experiments for every
feature every improvement every refinement has stood the test of
months and months of hard road service for the makers of the harley-
davidson never have and never will foist onto the public any so-called
imorovement in an experimental stage

step starter starts machine with rider in the saddle
and both wheels on the ground

    the step starter-another new and exclusive feature of the harley-davidson
furnishes the only practical method of starting a motorcycle yet offered to the public

    a downward push on either pedal spins the engine sufficiently to start it
this does away with the necessity of putting the machine on the stand to start
as the step starter can be used when both wheels are on the ground

     if the motor becomes stalled at any time it is no longer necessary to hold up
traffic in a crowded street find a level place in the road get off in the mud and
set the machine on the stand to start it a simple push on the pedal and the engine
again begins to throb

brake control-double control of freewheel
seat-other important improvements

 selective type of two-speed

  the harley-davidson selective type
of two-speed we believe to be not only
the most simple but the most compact
and efficient that has been placed on the
market it is located inside the rear
hub thus avoiding dust dirt or damage
its speeds are selective and the rider
can shift from low to high or high to low
or to neutral at any time whether the
machine is standing still or in motion
after thousands and thousands of miles
of use on experimental models we are
absolutely convinced that this is with-
out question the most satisfactory type
of two-speed that has ever been built

double brake control

  the brake on the new harley-david-
son can be operated either by a foot
lever on the right foot board or by back
pedaling on either pedal all models are
equipped with the harley-davidson
band brake

 double control of free wheel

  free wheel control now can be op-
erated either by foot lever on the left
foot board or by a hand lever the
foot lever control is an innovation which
does away with all fumbling or feeling
for the control lever and permits a much
more rapid engaging or dis-engaging of
the free wheel control by the rider

folding foot boards

  all models are equipped with folding
foot boards in addition to the foot
boards the pedals are retained the foot
boards are unusually long thus per-
mitting a great variety of positions
according to the height of the rider
this overcomes the great objection to the
ordinary type of foot boards they were
built to fit ths ordinary man and con-
sequently the purchaser who was a little
taller or a little shorter had to suffer
from the uncomfortable position his
height forced him to assume

ful-fioteing seat

  after building over  harley-
davidsons incorporating the ful-flote-
ing seat no possible method of im-
provement has suggested itself this
seat has proven itself absolutely to be
the greatest comfort device ever offered
floating as it does the weight of the
rider between two concealed compress-
ed springs it assimilates all the jars and
vibrations due to rough roads it is
equally sensitive to the small rut and
big bump it is impossible for it to strike
bottom and there is no rebound

tive literature giving full details of this
and the many other important improve-
ments together with the name of our

the next complete novel in

--is by	- - - ------

george barr mccutcheon

do you
remember
mccutcheon 

hes given you some of the
most entrancing hours in the
realm of romance

  remember  graustark  
there was action for you
and love 

  and castle cranevcrow
which carried us across seas
to the little principality of
sentiment where mccutch-
eons masterly pen created
characters that set a new
pace in literature

  who has not felt the thrill
of adventure the charm of
love-making under romantic
skies in beverly of graus-
tark  

 do you remember the
strength of  the hollow
of her hand and the
rattling good fiction in  a
fool and his money 

  once you feel the spell of
mccutcheon only mccutch-
eons stories will satisfy your
craving for rattling good
tale-telling

  in  black is white he
enters a new field-a field in
which he proves himself the
master of his subject the
deft marshal of word-pic-
tures which bring before us
a succession of events in
which the interest can never
lag

black
is
white

will be published
complete-a regular
 book-in the
december number

 the best in literature-that is the standard which we
 have set for the series of complete novels now run-
 ning in the munsey

 every one of them is a complete book if you bought
 it of a bookseller in cloth binding it would cost you from
  to  in the munsey it costs you  cents

 in discussing this new story mr mccutcheon says

     the principal woman is lrvonne brood and her husband is james
 brood whose sun is frederic brood lydia desmond is the girl
 with whom frederic is really in love

      it may be worthy of note that the whole book is devoted to the
 interior of broods hovse there are but two trifling scenes out-
 side its four walls i was particular in keeping the action inside
 the house

      i opened the book with a tempestuous night indoors and closed
 it in practically the same atmosphere and setting  the two old
 men opening and closing the story with all of the  meat  in
 between

 we shall leave to your imagination what occurs within
 these four walls of broods house-the passions that are
 aroused the sorrow that rests upon its master and the
 mystery that shrouds it all

interesting  we will guarantee you a yarn of en-
trancing interest tense moments and with a swing to its
action that keeps the blood moving at no snails pace

the telephone doors
of the nation

when you lift the bell telephone
receiver from the hook the doors
of the nation open for you

  wherever you may be a multitude
is within reach of your voice as
easily as you talk across the room
you can send your thoughts and
words through the open doors of bell
service into near-by and far-off states
and communities

  at any hour of the day or night
you can talk instantly directly
with whom you choose one mile
or a hundred or two thousand
miles away

  this is possible because 
telephones in every part of our
country are connected and work to-
gether in the bell system to promote
the interests of the people within
the community and beyond its limits

  it is the duty of the bell system to
make its service universal giving to
everyone the same privilege of talking
anywhere at any time

  because as the facilities for direct
communication are extended the
people of our country are drawn
closer together and national welfare
and contentment are promoted
