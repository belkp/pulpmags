freighters west

 by william heuman

the dust was six inches thick on fre-	there had been three others in the fight

mont street in nebraska city and	originally when theyd pulled the old team-

a man was having his face ground	ster from the seat of the big murphy

into it jay brandon listened to his scream	wagon and battered him into the dust

of pain as the bull whacker in the tattered	immaculate in- the gray beaver black

corduroy trousers lifted a heavy boot and	frock coat and polka-dot cravat jay had

thumped it into the beaten mans ribs	watched from the door of the emperor

as the flames subsided they charged to the high-pitched arapahoe yell

nebraska city was the hottest town on earth missouri river steamers
piled the wharves high with goods-but it would take real men-and
maybe miracles-to roll the stuff to the fort in the sioux country

a complete novel of the bullwhacker brigade

saloon two of the attackers had desisted
with the teamster on his knees leaving the
finishing touches to the red-haired red-
whiskered bullwhacker in the brown cordu-
roys the bullwhacker was a powerful
brutish man with thick sensuous lips and
small pigs eyes he enjoyed his task

  jay brandon tossed the cigar into the
gutter flicked the dust from the lapel of
the coat and then pushed his way through
the silent crowd he came up behind the
red-haired man as the bullwhacker was lift-
ing his boot again catching him by the
left arm he whirled him around and


	frontier

smashed a heavy fist into his gaping face

  the bullwhacker staggered back through
the crowd blood trickled from his split
lips as he sat down against the wheel of the
murphy

  come again  jay grinned he handed
the beaver to the nearest spectator and
then slipped out of the coat he stood out
in the center of the circle a lean dark-
haired man gray-eyed long-jawed

  cornin plenty mister the bullwhacker
grunted climbing to his feet he plodded
forward huge fists balled and hairy the
hatred written across his wide face

  jay waited for him eyes shifting to the
two men who had been in the fight at the
beginning he watched the beaten teamster
crawl through the crowd on hands and
knees shaking his head stupidly

  the bullwhacker rushed suddenly lash-
ing out with his right fist and trying to
drive his man to the ground jay brandon
stepped forward again his hard-knuckled
hand snapped out this time catching the
bullwhacker in the bridge of the nose and
breaking it cleanly

  the gore gushed out as he tottered for-
ward screaming with the pain his two
friends had shifted positions and were
coming up on either side of jay

  the smaller a stocky bald-headed man
in a dirty buckskin shirt and leggins
plunged forward at jays knees

  get him grady the other chap yelled
shrilly

  jay grinned he danced back lightly
and then brought his right foot up with
all the force he could muster the point
dug into the short mans stomach knocking
the wind from him he gasped once and
then lay on his face shivering digging
stubby fingers into the dust

  the bullwhacker with the broken nose
was still up and full of fight tears
coursed down his cheeks as he lunged in
again

  the third man a rangy chap in blue-
flannel shirt and flat-crowned teamsters
hat rushed in from the other side jay
danced in between the two of them as the
crowd yelled in appreciation

  he straightened up suddenly and rushed
the third man againstthe wagon hitting
him half a dozen times in the face with
lightning-like blows before stepping away
to meet the red-head again

 stories

  the hatchet-faced man in the blue shirt
sank down to the ground and came up with
a length of iron chain in his hand jay
rammed a fist into the bullwhackers stom-
ach doubling him up he kicked him in
the right kneecap knocking him to the
ground and putting him out of the fight

  the remaining battler stepped forward
swinging the chain around his head jay
moved back grimly that rusted chain
slashed across his face could take away his
eyesight

he tensed himself for a sudden spring
in under the steel whip it was un-
necessary a rather thin light-haired man
in the buckskin outfit of an army post scout
lifted a heavy  calibre walker dragoon
colt and pointed it at the other mans chest

  drop it friend he said quietly

  the man in the blue shirt eyed him coldly
the chain dangling in his hand jay bran-
don saw him weigh his chances they
were about eight feet apart the stranger
standing in the front line of the circle

  this thing shoots fast mister the
stranger in buckskin observed dont try
to beat it

  jay looked at him closely he was
dressed in the frontier style but he didnt
speak like a backwoodsman his words
were clipped eastern rather than western
he had cold blue eyes and a small straight
mouth

  the man with the chain laughed and
then tossed the object aside

  finish the fight gentlemen the new-
comer murmured laconically

  jay brandon was waiting for the next
rush the brawlers on the frontier all
fought the same way and they were quite
surprised when a man came into them with
straight-driving fists instead of backing
away the force of their own drive added
power to jays punches

  slowly he backed his man against the
wagon and hit him till he dropped into the
dirt stepping back he looked at his bleed-
ing knuckles

  the teamster who had been beaten was
back on the wagon seat lashing at his ani-
mals with a long blacksnake whip the
big murphy trundled away to the other
end of town jay saw the word ex-
celsior written in two-foot letters on
the side of the dirty white canvas
freighters west	

  he turned to the man with the gun you
drink mister he asked

  after you the stranger said

  the crowd yelled and slapped jays back
as he retrieved his clothing and walked
back toward the emperor

  names brandon he said just in
from denver they say nebraska citys
the hottest town on earth coming in on
the stage hed seen the long lines of bull
outfits pulling out for the frontier posts
acres of warehouses and stockyards had
been constructed on the outskirts of the
city wharves and levies along the mis-
souri were strewn with great piles of mer-
chandise destined for the interior the
steamers carried materials from the east as
far as nebraska city a half-dozen big
freighting concerns took up the task from
there on

  call me freeman the man in buckskin
stated sam freeman he didnt say
any more and jay didnt ask

  you took over some o lamontes boys
a big man at jays left observed he
wont be likin it mister he walked along
beside jay

  jay smiled since when he asked
does a big man like lamonte send three
of his teamsters out to work on a small
outfit like excelsior

  theres a lot o things lamonte will
do he was told since old john warbur-
ton grabbed that juicy government contract
away from him

  jay looked at sam freeman hed
heard of the big firm of lamonte darcy
and simmons freighters it was a half-
million-dollar concern the largest in the
nebraska territory they were reputed
to have over a thousand teamsters scattered
over the network twenty thousand oxen
and mules enormous wagonyards full of
the best murphys and the latest studebaker
wagons from the south bend indiana
manufacturers

  i just got in jay murmured you
know anything about this freeman

  the man in buckskin rubbed his aquiline
nose he spoke precisely as if giving a
report

  john warburton of the old excelsior
freighting company got the united states
government contract to furnish supplies
to the new fort taylor situated in the
sioux reservation

  jay nodded hed heard of the post re-
cently set up along the rosebud river

  lamonte wanted that contract free-
man finished theres been a lot of rough
play in town and half of the excelsior
teamsters have quit their jobs

  like today jay asked grimly three
against one

  sometimes freeman murmured its
worse theres been a fire in the ex-
celsior yards the last two bull outfits sent
out by warburton have failed to reach
fort taylor

  the big raw boned man at jays left
added there aint a man in nebraska city
will handle one o warburtons trains
lamonte sent the word out

  afraid jay grinned coldly

  zeke mccord excelsiors last wagon
master had both arms broken freeman
spoke up they found him in an alley
the other end of town

  tom malloy the man at jays left
chuckled was scalped by the sioux three
days before they reached fort taylor
jay brandon finished his drink and set
the glass down on the bar

  where is the excelsior office gentle-
men  he asked calmly he felt freemans
blue eyes on him

  head of fremont street the big man
told him opposite leroys saloon
ill walk along freeman volunteered

the two turned down the street
crossed the road skipping between two
enormous murphys rumbling toward the
yards of lamonte darcy and simmons
and stopped outside the door of the ex-
celsior freighting company

  it was a long shed-like building of un-
painted wood one story high and with a
false front a runway to the left led
into the wagonyard jay saw the rows of
enormous murphy wagons and a half
dozen of the espenshied models there
was little activity in the yards a few
men sauntered around or sat in the shade
of the blacksmith shop a fat rolypoly
man in a tattered red flannel shirt pounded
halfheartedly at a tire rim he looked at
them and grinned

  you taking this job freeman asked
softly

  if they need a wagon master jay
said and i qualify ill take it
frontier stories

  freeman shrugged ill have a look
around he said jay watched him walk
up the runway he noticed for the first
time the charred remains of one of the
sheds in the yard freeman had spoken
of a fire at the excelsior yards

  again jay looked up at the sign the
window was open and he heard the womans
voice from inside it was bitter almost
taunting

  theres not a man in nebraska city
dares enter this door she said tersely

  jay brandon blinked in surprise he
saw her face just above him the small
tight mouth lips slightly curled in con-
tempt eyes dark and bitter

  i reckon that doesnt apply to me he
grinned im from denver

  oh that explains it

  she studied him carefully as he came
through the door she was taller than he
had thought-almost too tall for a woman
her hair was as dark as her eyes she
sat behind a desk in the outer office

 mr warburton in jay asked i
hear he needs a wagon master

  she looked at his clothes a little con-
temptuously who do you speak for
she asked acidly

  jay smiled tell your boss mr bran-
don is asking for the job he said he
watched her walk into the other room
she nodded to him as she came out

  john warburton stood in the doorway a
short white-haired man leaning on a cane
for support there was a half-smile on
his smooth-shaven face and a twinkle in
the blue eyes

  mr brandon he asked

  jay nodded you need a wagon mas-
ter he said quietly id like the job
he noted the lines of worry in the short
mans face

  the head of the excelsior freighting
company pursed his lips and looked at the
girl

  my daughter priscilla he introduced
her

  jay bowed from the waist

  come inside john warburton toxd
him had any experience

  i handled the wagons for the colorado
river freighting company jay explained
four years of it

  what brings you to nebraska city
warburton asked

  colorado folded up jay stated the
mines petered out

  warburton drummed on the desk with
his fingers undoubtedly he smiled
coldly youve heard of the trouble we
are having getting the merchandise
through 

  jay nodded ive seen a little of it
he said grimly one of your teamsters
was pulled from his wagon this afternoon
warburtons eyes turned a shade lighter
ive lost half of my help he admitted
theyve been threatened and abused
many of have them have been bought out
lamonte behind it jay asked

 the old man shrugged lamonte
wanted that contract to begin with and
hes still aiming to get it he paused
weve lost the last two loads going
through to fort taylor if we lose the
next one the contract will be cancelled
ive already received word from colonel
bradley in command

  when is the next outfit going through 
jay wanted to know

  were loading at the piers now war-
burton explained itll be ready to roll
in three days thirty wagons one hundred
and fifty ton of foodstuffs

  what happened to the last two trains 
jay asked

  one got as far as elbow creek war-
burton snapped bitterly the oxen stam-
peded it took me a month to get the
wagons back to nebraska city half the
teamsters deserted

  the sioux get the second jay mur-
mured

  john warburton looked at him strangely
so ive been told he said though
the sioux are supposed to be quiet right
now

  jay brandon nodded time and again
the old ruse had been worked-white men
parading as indians and having the red-
men blamed for the catastrophe warbur-
ton had not been fooled

  you have a crew for this outfit he
asked

  there are about fifty of the older men
left with me john warburton told him
theyll stick till excelsior goes under
he laughed a little grimly if we lose
this fort taylor contract im through
lamonte already offered to buy me out-
at about a third the value of the company
freighters west

he watched jays face thoughtfully you
still willing to run the train he asked

id like to meet the men jay said
well roll whenever you give the word
john warburton held out his hand
good luck he said simply you know
what to expect

  out in the yard they saw a group of
men squatting in a half circle over by the
blacksmith shop

  you can go back jay said softly
well get acquainted

  john warburton called out boys-
meet the new wagon master jay lit a
cigar and then strolled forward the team-
sters remained seated on the ground they
were a mixed lot mostly missourians with
a sprinkling of frenchmen a few breeds
and a giant negro some of them held
dirty playing cards in their hands while
the others watched the game

  warburton stood by the door as jay
walked toward his men none of them got
up he felt their eyes going over his
clothing-the new beaver hed purchased
before leaving denver the trim black frock
coat and shining new boots

   well boys said jay easily lets get
 down to work

   the mulatto grinned revealing a row of
pearly teeth a french canuck in a tat-
tered white coat laughed in a high-pitched
voice

   the fat man who had been laboring with
the tire rim looked up rivulets of sweat
dripped down his face to the ground

  one of you boys help the gentleman
with the wheel jay smiled the others
can start greasing axles

   we aint usin dem wagons boss the
big darky grinned de wagons are all
down at the pier

   jay nodded he was standing just above
a big missourian with tousled blond hair
and hard sneering blue eyes

   wed like to keep the other wagons in
condition the new wagon master ex-
plained we may be using them shortly
he turned his head to look at john war-
burton the girl was leaning out the win-
dow watching from the building
everybody up jay said softly

  the missourian looked him over from
head to foot and then deliberately spat on
the new boot the mulatto went into hys-
terical guffaws

jay tightened his teeth on the cigar
carefully he placed the beaver on a peg
in the nearby wall then bending down
suddenly he grasped the missourian by
the lapels of his coat and yanked him to
his feet his right fist shot up catching
the man full on the jaw and knocking him
against the wall

  he heard john warburton yell and
then he leaped through the circle of men
knocking cards and money aside the
missourian was trying to straighten himself
out when jay knocked him back against
the wall again hitting straight out with
his fists

  he struck a half-dozen times before the
big teamster slumped to the ground face
cut and bleeding it was all over in a
matter of seconds and the cigar was still
set between the new wagon masters teeth

  the french canuck was scrambling to
his feet his blacksnake whip in his hand
when jay let go with his right foot hed
learned the french art of fighting from a
creole muleskinner in denver

  his boot caught the canuck in the stom-
ach as he was lifting the stock of the whip
as he doubled up jay stepped in with a
short punch to the jaw there was no more
fight in the frenchman

   in fact the fight was over

  the fat man let out a yell of surprise
which turned to one of pain as he let the
heavy tire fall down on his toes

  get the tar buckets jay said quietly
everybody move

  they got up this time the mulatto
scratching his head and staring at the inert
form of the missourian the others gaped
and then grinned

  get me a bucket of water jay told
the fat man he squatted down beside the
missourian a moment later and bathed his
face with a wet handkerchief john war-
burton was still standing by the door watch-
ing him quietly

  the big blond-haired man opened his
eyes he sat up and shook his head

  what happened he asked weakly

  you fell jay said

  the missourian rubbed his face gin-
gerly he saw the canuck a few feet away
on hands and knees still panting for
breath

  damn he whispered frenchy got
it too he stared at jay for a moment
	frontier

what you got inside mister he mumbled
a wildcat

  no hard feelings jay said

  nary a one the missourian grinned
im on your side mister names ma-
lone

  jay shook hands with him and stood up
he helped the canuck to his feet and
walked him to a nearby bench

  by gar the dark-skinned man gasped

  when you feel better jay told him
you help the other boys he walked
back to the office and john war burton
shook his head admiringly

  i believe youve handled teamsters be-
fore mr brandon he chuckled

  jay nodded it was necessary to meet a
bullwhacker on his own ground and hed
learned their way of fighting adding a few
of his own innovations

  the wagons will be leaving in three
days warburton went on try to stay
out of lamontes way while youre in
nebraska city mr brandon

  jay smiled he looked up at the girl in
the window behind them lamonte had
better stop molesting my men he said
slowly or ill be looking him up myself

  warburton blinked id advise you to
go armed he said

  jay swung open the frock coat reveal-
ing the colt  slung at his side

  if you use it as well as your fists the
head of excelsior smiled ill have no
worries

  jay saw the trim figure of sam freeman
standing at the front of the building

  need any night herders he asked
warburton suddenly

  were short all along the line war-
burton explained if you can persuade
any men in nebraska city to work for us
youre at liberty to hire them

  i think i have one man jay murmured
he walked down the runway and stopped in
front of the man in buckskin again he
noticed freemans posture comparing it
with the lounging attitude of the real
frontiersmen sam freeman stood up
straight shoulders back head erect look-
ing for work jay asked

  freeman shrugged with excelsior
he asked

  i need a night herder jay told him
were rolling in three days to fort taylor
want to come

stories

  why not freeman said promptly
lamonte wont like it jay grinned
the grin broadened when he saw the an-
swering smile on freemans lean face
freeman was like himself both men
relished bucking a big man like lamonte

  ill take my chances mister freeman
stated quietly

ii

they walked down to the wharf to
watch the steamers unloading two
dozen excelsior wagons were lined up at
one of the piers as husky roustabouts lifted
boxes and heavy kegs into the murphys

  further along the waters edge they
spotted a line of lamontes big studebaker
vehicles husky texas steers clanking the
chains

hes a big man in this town freeman
observed started from scratch with two
wagons and pulled himself up to the top
what about darcy and simmons 
they supply the cash for lamonte
freeman told him black jack is the
kingpin he makes the wheels go round
black jack lamonte jay murmured
let him alone freeman said and
hell buy out or force out every small op-
erator like warburton and control the
biggest freighting company in the states
he wont buy out warburton jay
said he thought of the girl-the curl of
her lips when he came in she expected
him to cringe when jack lamonte cracked
the whip-crawl away as the others had

  john warburton was rolling freight
wagons in this section when lamonte was
in short pants freeman pointed out
hell stick if he can

  hell be broke jay said if he loses
this fort taylor contract he can burn
his wagons for firewood

  back in town they had to pass the em-
peror saloon to get to the hotel at which
jay was staying there was a crowd in
front of the saloon jay could see the red
hair of the big bullwhacker hed licked
earlier in the afternoon

  a powerful dark-haired man in fiat-
crowned black sombrero stood in the cen-
ter of the crowd jay saw only his shoul-
ders and the back of his neck

  lamonte freeman said his boys
probably have been complaining
freighters west	

  jay unbuttoned his coat and walked for-
ward slowly it might pay he mur-
mured to have a little chat with mr
lamonte

  he went on freeman following

  they gave him room when he was rec-
ognized lamonte turned around reveal-
ing a bony heavy-jawed face and piercing
black eyes his mouth was straight and
large the chin cloven down the middle

  the red-headed bullwhacker started to
roar when he saw jay his nose was
patched up and there were half a dozen
small cuts on his face black jack lamonte
stared at the man before him with interest

  mr lamonte jay asked easily he
could read the ruthlessness in the big mans
cold black eyes lamonte was the kind of
man who had to have his own way or die

  you the gentleman whipped flanni-
gan lamonte asked jay caught the hint
of humor in his tones the crowd gath-
ered around closer sam freeman pushed
up at jays side his right hand on the butt
of the walker colt

  in the future jay told him i take it
as a personal affront when a lamonte
teamster touches an excelsior driver
flannigan was working over one of war-
burtons men

  jack lamonte shoved powerful hands
inside his coat pockets he rocked on the
balls of his feet

  youre taking quite a deep interest in
excelsior the big man murmured a
stranger in nebraska city vould play a
much smarter game by keeping his nose
out of affairs which do not concern him

  im the new wagon master at excel-
sior jay brandon grinned any man
who touches an excelsior driver will get
a dose of the same thing flannigan got
he smiled but there was no humor in
his eyes

  no man in the world lamonte stated
could do to me what you did to flanni-

 f

gan

  well let it go at that jay said this
much i know if any man interferes with
warburtons next bull outfit im going
after him with guns and not fists he
pushed past black jack lamonte and
walked toward the hotel

  sam freeman caught up with him half
way down the block

  dont look behind he whispered

gradys following you ill cut off and
pick him up at the next corner

  jay nodded grimly it was problematical
whether lamonte had sent the bald-headed
man or whether grady was acting on his
own interests jay had knocked him down
in the fight with the bullwhacker

  hes armed freeman went on keep
your gun handy the man in buckskin
turned down the next alley

  jay watching him saw the man sprint
around the next corner in a minute hed
be coming up on grady from behind cross-
ing the road jay glanced back out of the
corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of
a man about thirty yards behind him an-
other man in a blue-flannel shirt was just
catching up with his pursuer

  the new excelsior wagon master reached
inside his coat lifted the colt halfway from
the holster and spun the cylinder once he
had to face two guns now

  a half block from the hotel jay stopped
suddenly and started to walk toward the
two men he read the surprise in their
faces as they waited for him the bald-
headed grady stepped out into the gutter
and the man in the blue flannel shirt hugged
the wall at the same instant jay saw
sam freeman turn around the corner and
come up behind the two lamonte men

  you boys looking for me jay asked
softly his coat was swung open and
the gun cleared

  gradys small yellow eyes shifted to the
other man on the walk one of them was
sure to get him if they both started firing
at once jay waited for them to make the
play he saw grady settling himself in
the dust of the road

  sam freeman called out grady

  the bald-headed man spun around
freeman was not more than fifteen yards
behind him standing feet apart on the
planked sidewalk a small grin on his face

  grady read the pattern and then dug
for his gun at the same time the man
in the blue shirt dropped his right hand
jay brandon leaped to the side he heard
gradys gun and then freemans but he
kept his eyes on the man by the wall

the lamonte teamster was lifting his
weapon from the holster when jays
gun barked the bullet caromed off the
brick wall behind the lank man jay
	frontier

dropped to the street he felt the return
slug graze the top of the beaver tipping
it slightly to the side

  freemans big dragoon gun boomed
again the man in the blue shirt threw
another hasty shot which went wide of the
mark jay levelled on him quietly and
squeezed the trigger the bullet knocked
his man back against the wall he tried
to straighten up and shoot again

  jay brandon held his third shot as he
watched the dying man trying to raise his
gun for the last time the effort was use-
less with a heavy gasping sound the
man in the blue shirt slid down to the walk
his head hung on one side

  thats all sam freeman called from
the corner

  jay saw grady lying on his face in the
dirt his six-shooter had fallen from his
hand and was lying inches away from his
outstretched fingers there was a red
streak across freemans cheek where the
bald-headed mans bullet had touched him

  the crowd from up the street surged
down toward them as the firing ceased
jay brandon watched black jack lamonte
striding along the walk coat swinging open

  ill take anybody else who opens up
freeman called to jay the wagon master
nodded this was the showdown and la-
monte was playing his hand

  a short stout man suddenly popped out
f the big missouri saloon and grasped
lamontes arm jay saw him remonstrate
with the head of the freighting outfit

  thats darcy freeman whispered
he doesnt want lamonte to risk a bullet
in the head

  jack lamonte tried to break away and
continue down the street but darcy clung
to him a man in calfskin vest rounded
the corner and bore down at them he
wore a star on his left side

  sheriff wade freeman said the
fights over

  they saw lamonte and darcy go back
into the saloon wade looked at the two
bodies and shook his head

  lamontes boys he murmured you
hombres better clear out

  they opened up on us jay told him
quietly were leaving when were ready
sheriff

  your funeral wade grunted

  jay stopped in the next morning at the

stories

office of excelsior priscilla greeted him
with a nod

  i heard about the fight she said slowly
please be careful mr brandon

  because this load must go through
jay grinned nothing else

  thats enough the girl murmured but
he saw her face redden slightly inci-
dentally she went on youre taking a
passenger through to fort taylor
who jay asked

  me she told him

  jay laughed not this load he stated
flatly itll be no place for a woman
ive gone with bull outfits before
priscilla warburton said stiffly

  not when i was wagon master jay
grinned forget about it he went into
the office and john warburton shook hands
with him your daughter wants to ride
along with the train jay said he heard
her come in behind him and stand by the
door

  the head of the excelsior freighting
company nodded gloomily i dont like
to do it he muttered

  jay stared you mean shes to go
he asked-its eight hundred miles to fort
taylor-two months on the road

  i cant go myself mr warburton told
him and somebody has to sign papers
renewing the contracts priscilla is an of-
ficial of the company

  itll be dangerous jay said if la-
monte tries to stop us

  i hope i can depend upon you to bring
her safely through warburton replied
a cavalry escort will return to nebraska
city with you so itll be safe on the way
back

  theres no other way jay asked
couldnt i sign for the company

  they wouldnt accept your signature
mr brandon warburton explained
priscilla has handled transactions before
i can depend upon her to see to the com-
panys best interests he smiled at his
daughter as he spoke

  i promise to stay out of your way mr
brandon priscilla said acidly

  as you will jay told her he went
out sam freeman listened to the story
with interest

  if i know anything about army pro-
cedure the man said colonel bradley
wouldnt be able to deal with anyone but
freighters west	

an actual agent or part owner of the com-
pany if mr warburton cant go i
imagine his daughter is the only one who
can negotiate with the colonel

  jay brandon laughed grimly if we
dont get this load through he said
therell be no contract to renew

they rolled out of nebraska city the
next morning at ten oclock the thirty
big murphy wagons rumbled through the
dust wheels sinking deep into the road
eight yoke of oxen to each wagon

  jay brandon riding a taffy-maned geld-
ing trotted up along the line of wagons
hed exchanged the black frock coat for
one of buckskin a flat-crowned som-
brero took the place of the beaver

  the thirty excelsior bullwhackers strode
along beside their wagons cracking the
long blacksnake whips sam freeman
had gone ahead with six other night
herders driving with them extra stock

  the cavalcade rolled past the emperor
saloon and a crowd came out to watch
jay saw jack lamonte smoking a long
black cigar hands thrust into his vest
pockets the big freighting man stared
at him as he trotted past on the gelding
his black eyes flickered slightly as the
lead wagon with priscilla warburton on
the seat lumbered past

  the big red-headed bullwhacker stood
with him his nose encased in bandages
another shorter man with a thin face and
long bony nose stood at lamontes left
he watched jay steadily as if measuring
him

  as the wagon master moved his horse
past malone the excelsior bullwhacker
motioned to him to come closer

  the little man malone grunted is
cole hartman we run across him out
on the trail two days afore tom malloy
got it

  i thought malloy was scalped jay
said steadily

  malone laughed bitterly they wasnt
indians he snapped one of em had
a mustache they run off our stock an
when tom went after em he got into a
ambush he had ten bullets in him an
his top was gone

  they get the wagons too jay asked

  malone nodded when we was chasin
the stock another party of em came in

behind and burned up all the wagons
jay glanced back at cole hartman
undoubtedly lamonte had used hartman
the last time to break up the outfit hart-
man said something to lamonte and then
the big man threw away his cigar

  hes quick with a gun too malone
muttered if we meet him on the trail
brandon you better shoot first

  i intend to jay said briefly

  the bullwhackers broke into the old
root hog or die song as they rolled
out of town jay listened thoughtfully
he watched the line of plodding men and
oxen frenchy ledeaux the mulatto sam
carson the fat man tibbs bragan
malone led the singing

  ill tell you how it is when	-

  you first get on the road

  you have an awkward team and
  a very heavy load

  you have to whip and holler but
  swear upon the sly

  youre in for it then boys

  root hog or die

  the last came with a terrific roar big
carsons deep bass sounding above the
others jay brandon rode on ahead to
catch up with freeman and the stock
he passed priscillas wagon and tipped
his hat politely the girl nodded she
had her own horse tied behind the wagon
a small white-stockinged black animal

  amos gaunt company scout and hunter
rode at the head of the train jay moved
up beside him gaunt was a small figure
in a bulky buffalo coat he had drooping
yellow mustaches and keen gray eyes

  how far do we get tonight jay
asked ive never been in this country
gaunt shrugged we kin make fifteen
mile he figured or maybe twenty de-
pendin upon the mood o these damned
animals he paused and spat into the
dust of the road thatll take us up to
arrowhead creek

  think well hit any trouble with the
sioux jay went on

  aint no sioux this side o the rose-
bud gaunt told him theyre mostly
over near the mountains this time o year
cuttin lodge poles he looked at jay
steadily it aint the red devils im
	frontier

worryin about he observed its the
white ones

  well handle them jay said grimly

  gaunt stared straight ahead three
days along arrowhead creek an big paint
river we hit long grass

  long grass jay murmured

  it burns gaunt said flatly burns
like hell

  jay brandon looked at his horses ears
thanks amos he said quietly ill
bear it in mind

  i aint aimin to fry myself gaunt
told him

ill

they camped that night on the other
side of arrowhead creek a shallow
weedy stretch of water about thirty yards
across sam freeman stood at the big
fire before going out with the other night
herders

  jay walked over to him amos gaunt
was drinking coffee from a big tin cup
a few feet away the company cook
was making enormous quantities of beans
and bacon

  looking from gaunt to freeman jay
couldnt help but notice the difference
gaunt was the typical frontiersman slouch-
ing slow of speech slurring his words
freeman even as he ate stood erect he
didnt gulp his food like the others

  im putting you in charge of the night
herders jay said well be keeping most
of the stock inside the enclosure at night
but we wont be able to accommodate the
extra animals

  instinctively freeman stiffened as jay
gave him the orders the wagon master
paused beside gaunt as freeman went
away into the night

  ever lun across freeman before he
asked

  never seen him gaunt said indif-
ferently he wiped his hands on the black-
ened buckskin leggins

  jay made his round of the corral the
wagons were drawn up in the shape of a
huge horseshoe the front wheels of each
vehicle chained to the rear wheels of the
murphy in front of it tongues turned
inward the most ferocious texas steer
on the trail would have a difficult time
breaking out of the enclosure

stories

  moving through the darkness he heard
priscilla warburtons voice calling him
from the wagon he went over

  keeping the oxen inside tonight she
asked

  tonight jay said and every night
it was the custom to let them out to graze
at the end of the days haul and drive
them into the enclosure early the next
morning for yoking

  when do they graze priscilla asked
curiously

  we start an hour later each morning
the wagon master explained we can
run them outside the corral and keep a
close watch on them in the daylight he
realized that if lamonte struck at them
it would be through the animals first
with the oxen stampeded the wagons
would be stalled on the trail

  you seem to know your business
miss warburton said grudgingly i give
you credit for it

  thank you maam jay grinned
ive had lots of experience he touched
his hat and went on hed met women
in the silver towns in colorado and fur-
ther west on the coast but none like
priscilla warburton she was efficient
and she stood up to him

  arrowhead creek emptied into the big
paint river there was a fording place
which all the bull outfits took when head-
ing into the sioux country it was at
the first bend of the big paint where the
river was only about two hundred feet
across and the bottom sandy and firm

  jay saw the tall grass waving on the
other side of the river he looked at
amos gaunt and the scout rubbed his jaw
with a grimy hand that night jay rode
back along the rivers edge for several
miles with sam freeman

  i dont think theyll strike this early
freeman stated were still too close to
nebraska city

  im curious jay muttered if some-
ones on my tail i like to know who it is

  it was a clear moonlit night and they
saw nothing amos gaunt met them as
they were coming back

  were only about fifty miles from
nebraska city the scout said that
aint a far ride for men who want to come
badly enough they kin set home and light
out whenever theyre ready
freighters west	

  jay brandon nodded it was logical
enough if lamonte wanted to come after
them he could start out in the morning
and pick them up whenever he wished

  starting at four oclock the next morn-
ing they pushed on for eight miles through
the tall grass coming up to the tops of the
wagon wheels jay stared at the dry
brown fields stretching along the river
he chose his campsite carefully that night
selecting a gradual slope thirty yards up
from the river

  when the wagons were rolled into the
corral and the oxen unyoked big malone
slipped his chains from the wagon and
prepared to fasten his wheels

  jay called to him sharply no chains
tonight malone

  the bull whacker blinked no chains 
he asked

  pass the word down the line jay
told him none of the wagons are to
be chained

  priscilla warburton heard the command
and she climbed down from tibbs
bragans wagon

  arent you getting a bit careless mr
brandon she asked quietly i realize
we are not in danger so close to nebraska
city but-

  your father hired me as wagon mas-
ter jay told her flatly im giving the
orders he saw her lips tighten and he
grinned as she strode down toward the
river

  sam freeman sitting astride his blue
roan watched complacently as the en-
closure was made all the wagons were
rolled into the usual horseshoe but the
wheels were not chained

  take your stock along the rivers edge
jay called to the night herder keep
them close to the water youll know
what to do if anything happens

  freeman smiled you afraid of this
grass brandon he asked

  yes jay told him i dont like it
he set a double guard that night before
turning in priscilla warburton came up
as he was eating at the big fire

i still think its foolish she snapped
the men will be acquiring lax habits
jay drank his coffee with relish let
me worry about their habits he chuckled

  two hours before dawn one of the
guards shot off his gun

jay leaped from under the wagon in
the darkness he bumped into amos
gaunt

  itll be gettin hot the scout muttered
like i thought

  the wind blowing toward us jay
asked grimly out beyond the enclosure
about a hundred yards distant he saw
bright spots of moving light here and
there new lights were springing up as if by
magic forming a giant half-circle around
the wagon enclosure

  gaunt sniffed loudly and then swore
under his breath they were waitin
all night till the breeze shifted this way
he said that grass will go up like tinder
git yore wagons rollin mister

  jay raced to the two smoldering fires
in the center of the corral picking up
huge armfuls of dried grass hed stored
there the previous night he threw them
on the fire immediately the enclosure
was lit up stumbling men rolling out
from beneath the wagons blinked at the
ring of fire sweeping toward them from
the prairie

  drive the stock into the river jay
shouted a dozen men complied with his
order from up the river they heard a
few shots and faint yells jay brandon
smiled sam freeman was undoubtedly
doing the same thing with his animals

  youll have to git them wagons out o
here gaunt called

  jay nodded he saw priscilla warbur-
ton running toward him in the firelight
the remaining bull whackers waited for
the next order

  turn your wagons around jay yelled
head them toward the river the roar-
ing ring of fire was now only seventy-five
yards away they could feel the heat
burning embers dropped around them as
they worked

  a half-dozen men grasped the wheels of
a wagon and turned it about so the murphy
faced the river

  get a man on the seat jay shouted
brake it as it rolls

  the bullwhackers got the implication
all the murphys were standing on a slight
incline and it required but a little push
to start them rolling toward the river of
their own volition

  another wagon and then another was
whirled around and sent rumbling down
	frontier

the grade jay brandon watched the fire
sweeping toward them he caught a
glimpse of riders behind the flames but
was unable to discern whether they were
white men or indians

  we better be ready fer em gaunt
called when this fire gits down to the
water theyll try to rush us

  more than half the wagons were al-
ready rolling into the water the others
got clear when the fire was still thirty
yards away jay raced after the last one
he saw the girl just ahead of him she
stumbled as she ran

the riders behind the fire were now
shooting through the flames and jay
heard the bullets whistle past him amos
gaunt stopped to return the fire while jay
ran ahead to pick up the girl

  she was gasping for breath as he lifted
her from the ground and ran toward the
water all the wagons were safely in the
river with the bawling oxen scrambling
around between them

  jay plunged knee-deep into the river and
waded out to the nearest wagon he set
the girl down on the seat and then called
to the bullwhackers

  malone was the first one to reach him
line the men up along the river jay
ordered if they try to break through
well give them all they asked for
ledeauxs wagon went over malone
informed him i reckon all the others got
down in good shape

  jay nodded he saw the frenchmans
wagon lying at the edge of the river
ledeaux having jumped clear when it
tilted they had saved twenty-nine out
of the thirty wagons and it was possible
the flames never would reach ledeauxs
murphy as the grass was short and the
earth marshy at the rivers edge

  here they come amos gaunt yelled
give it to em boys

  the bullwhackers were stretched out
along the bank rifles ready there were
about forty or fifty men behind the flames
jay could see them more clearly now
they were white men he thought he
caught a glimpse of the small wiry cole
hartman lamontes right-hand man but
he wasnt sure

  the teamsters opened fire as the attack-
ers came up behind the flames jay saw

stories

a half dozen saddles emptied men
screamed in the smoke and flames

  the fire rolled up through the shorter
grass near the water anti the smoke choked
and blinded them

  coughing and gasping for breath jay
turned his face away for a moment two
riders were driving through the fire when
he faced around again he shot twice
at the nearer man and saw him slip from
the saddle and drop screaming into the
burned embers

  the second rider spurred directly at
him gun cracking jay felt one slug go
through his shirt he shot quickly and the
horse stumbled to its knees shooting the
rider over its head

  big denny malone grabbed the man
as he hit the grass jay saw him pick
up the rider and rush him into the water
he heard the mans gurgling gasp when
malone came back he was alone

  i reckon theyre runnin amos gaunt
called

  flames were beginning to lick at
ledeauxs wagon when jay gave the order
to save it three bullwhackers tore the
burning canvas from the load and beat
out the flames with wet blankets

  a rider hammered down along the river
and came toward them

  dont fire he yelled it was sam
freeman he grinned when he saw the
wagons and the oxen out in the water

  where are your animals jay asked

  all safe freeman chuckled but a
little wet

  jay waded out to the wagon in which
priscilla warburton was crouching the
prairie fire was sputtering out as it reached
the stretch of marsh along the river but
the acrid smoke still hung over them the
girl coughed several times before speaking

  it was very clever she said quietly
i want to apologize mr brandon

  no need jay told her this is my
business im taking these wagons through
to fort taylor if i have to go by way of
hell itself

  you think lamonte was behind the
raid priscilla asked

  we wont know till morning jay ex-
plained a number of the men were hit
and we might be able to identify some of
lamontes teamsters

  did we lose anything priscilla asked
freighters west	

  one wagon slightly scorched jay
grinned and a few bullet wounds-noth-
ing serious

  they wont stop at this miss warbur-
ton murmured lamonte will strike
again

  well be ready for him jay said
quietly im hoping the next time he
comes in person

  they found eight bodies in the morn-
ing lying in the charred remains of the
fire malone immediately identified two
of them as lamontes bullwhackers the
others were strangers

  double yokes of oxen were hitched to
the wagons and they were drawn out on
the bank of the big paint river an hour
after dawn the cavalcade was rolling again

iv

three days later they turned north
from the big paint and struck out
over the trackless plain amos gaunt
shot buffalo and kept the crew well sup-
plied with fresh meat each night jay
brandon rode back along the trail watch-
ing for signs of lamontes men but they
seemed to have disappeared

  theyll be back gaunt muttered i
used to work with lamontes outfit he
dont give up till hes dead

  jay brandon stared toward the north
and the west they still had hundreds of
miles of trail ahead of them and lamonte
would have plenty of opportunities to strike
again

  week after week they moved up the
trail fording the elk the smoky and then
the sand pushing toward the rosebud
time and again the excelsior wagons
threatened to give way axles and wheels
snapped as they cut across dry plain they
had to stop for two days in a hickory
grove to replenish the spare axles which
had all been used up

  tire irons loosened as the wheels shrunk
and they had to be burned on again con-
suming valuable time while the train
stopped three hundred miles from fort
taylor they ran across a war party of
arapahoes in from the mountain country

  amos gaunt spotted the wide trail and
pulled up suddenly jay brandon rode
up beside him the trail was very fresh
-not more than a few hours old

  the scout dismounted and picked up a
tuft of feather he grimaced reckon
there must be two hundred of em he
mumbled arapahoes

  theyre not fighting the whites jay
said

  gaunt laughed softly nobody kin ever
tell when an indian is fightin or not fightin
this party probably came after cheyenne
horses but im hopin we dont strike
em ourselves

  you think theyll attack us jay
wanted to know

  gaunt shrugged theres a lot o stuff
in these wagons theyd like to have he
said and theres alius a lot o young bucks
on these war parties who dont give a
hoot who they fight as long as they fight
theyre heading south jay murmured
we might never see them

  but theyll see us gaunt grinned
never fear one o their hunters will
strike our trail and theyll foller to see
who we are

  the arapahoes discovered them late the
next afternoon jay spotted them at a
distance of a half mile-a long column of
riders moving along the rim of a hill

  git em circlin gaunt growled dont
take any chances brandon

  jay was already giving the orders and
the train wheeled into a compact circle
wagon tongues inside the bullwhackers
were chaining the wheels when the arapa-
hoes tore down at them

  dont anybody fire jay shouted till
i give the word

  they aint attackin gaunt muttered
when they do you wont see em cornin
he paused itll do good though to
show em were ready to fight it teaches
em a little respect

  there were about two hundred in the
party which raced down the hill shouting
shrilly and firing guns into the air jay
saw that priscilla warburton was safe out
of sight inside the wagon he waited with
gaunt and freeman as the war party came
to a halt a hundred yards away

  reckon they want to talk gaunt said
better give em a few bags o flour bran-
don

  jay watched with interest the sinewy
hawk-eyed men from the mountain coun-
try hed had experiences with the shorter
ferocious apaches to the south the
	frontier stories

arapahoes were different-a tall hand-
some sharp-nosed people resplendent in
gaudy war clothes brightly painted shields
and lances spotted indian ponies painted
with the same material the men daubed
on their faces

  a half dozen of them rode forward
slowly hands upraised jay heard amos
gaunt swear behind him

  too many young bucks the scout
stated flatly i dont like it brandon
he walked out with the wagon master
as jay climbed between two of the wagons
and waited for the chiefs

  gaunt spoke to them in the sign lan-
guage

  red men want to greet white brothers
gaunt grinned think o that

  ask them what they want jay said
tersely

  presents gaunt growled what
else

  jay saw the arapahoe leaders staring at
the wagons he called back to malone
inside the enclosure bring out three bags
of flour a sack of sugar and a drum of
molasses

  two of the teamsters helped carry the
goods out and place it on the ground

  more gaunt growled they say it
aint enough

  tell them the wagons are going to
the white soldiers on the rosebud jay
snapped we cant give them any more

  the arapahoe chieftains listened to
gaunt gravely three of them were older
men and they spoke rapidly to the younger
element jay brandon waited till they
were finished

  tell them to take what they got he
said to gaunt or well have the soldiers
chase them back to the mountains

  the scout chuckled thats the lan-
guage they understand mister he said
softly

  the arapahoes finally picked up the
merchandise and rode back with it jay
watched the entire group whirl away
toward the south he breathed more
freely

  it was close enough gaunt said
them young bucks aint satisfied but
the big chiefs told em to take what was
given em

  you think theyll come back jay
asked

  not unless someone brings em

gaunt said sagely

  jay nodded in understanding

they camped that night on the spot
and got away to an early start in
the morning at noon they crossed the
buffalo creek and made eight miles before
stopping at painted rock

  constantly jay brandon rode back
during the day to watch for white or red
riders lamonte should have struck a
long way back but he didnt day after day
they waited for the attack which never
came

  maybe sam freeman advised hes
given it up they know we can fight off
a good-sized body of men

  hes waiting priscilla murmured
when he comes itll be with a good chance
of success

  jay brandon looked at the girl closely
she had held her own with the men from
the start and had never complained her
face was tanned from the sun and her
eyes were bright often now she rode
with him as he trotted his horse ahead of
the train

  it means a lot to you jay told her
to get this outfit through

  priscilla warburton laughed fas a
child she said quietly i remember my
father driving a single broken-down wagon
hes built up excelsior and id hate to see
it go down

  jay called a halt at three oclock that
afternoon to give the oxen a little extra
rest the animals were losing weight and
they were still several days out of fort
taylor

  as the thirty murphys started to cir-
cle amos gaunt rode up to the wagon
master and tapped him on the shoulder

  i reckon we ought to take a little ride
brandon the scout said softly

  jay looked at him quickly gaunts face
was grim and sober

  i seen smoke gaunt grunted its
gone now but i figger we ought to have
a look

  jay looked around for sam freeman to
give him his orders with the herd but the
night rider wasnt in sight hed probably
gone on ahead with his stock to look for
better grazing land

  lets go jay said he saw priscilla
freighters west	

watching him from the wagon as he rode
off she waved a hand

  how far off jay asked

  maybe five miles gaunt replied it
could be a hunting party of arapahoes or
it could be somebody else

  they were riding toward the south and
the west-the direction the arapahoes had
taken when they left gaunt had little to
say on the way he pointed again after
theyd ridden about three miles

  reckon youll have to look close to see
it the scout muttered theyre burnin
dry wood an it dont smoke

  jay brandon saw the thin trailer of
white smoke scarcely discernible against
the late afternoon sky

  well ride careful gaunt told him

  they had to recross buffalo creek and
follow the stream a half mile before gaunt
called a halt he dismounted and tied his
mount to a willow growing along the bank

  i figger well find em on the other
side o this grove the scout muttered
well crawl up on em brandon

  they pushed their way through the
thicket for nearly a quarter of a mile
through the trees jay could see other
trailers of smoke indicating a rather large
encampment

  gaunt stopped as the grove thinned out
they could see moving figures ahead of
them

  indians jay murmured

  not all of em gaunt scowled they
lay on their faces in the grass and peered
between the branches looks like a
meetin goin on the scout said theres
lamonte

  lamonte jay brandon tightened he
saw the big man talking with the arapahoe
chiefs through an interpreter the red-
headed flannigan was with him on one
side and the small cole hartman on the
other there were about fifty white men
in a group watching furtively

  its the same war party we run across
gaunt whispered

  whats lamonte saying jay asked
tightly they were using the sign language
and even at the distance gaunt could make
out most of the talk

  hes askin the arapahoes to join
him in an attack on the train gaunt
mumbled when a man goes that far-

-frontier stories-fall

  jay brandon laughed coldly lamonte
wont stop at anything he said hes
probably been following us all along wait-
ing for a break like this he was afraid
to attack with only fifty men if he gets
the arapahoes to work with him theyll
outnumber us four or five to one

  gaunt laughed suddenly some o them
chiefs aint failin for his stuff he said
they dont want the white soldiers after
em

  another man who had been standing on
the side suddenly joined in the conversa-
tion he was holding ahorse by the bridle
-a blue roan jay brandon stiffened

  damn i amos gaunt whispered the
scouts mouth opened in surprise he half
lifted himself from the ground and jay
had to pull him down

  a party of young bucks pushed a group
of ponies down toward the water they
were coming perilously close

  wed better git gaunt muttered
jay brandon took another close look
at the man with the blue roan horse he
was wearing buckskins then they
crawled back through the grove neither
man spoke till they were up on their feet
and trotting toward the place where theyd
left the horses

  you recognize him too jay asked
quietly i wasnt seeing things

  it was freeman the scout snarled
id know him he was no more a scout
than im a senator

jay climbed on his horse slowly i
dont understand it he said free-
man saved my life in nebraska city he
was working with me against lamonte
now hes on lamontes side

  hes a queer one gaunt told him
he never had much to say maybe la-
monte had him on the payroll all along
an he was spyin on us the scout paused
he might have got lamonte an the
arapahoes together

  if they come jay said flatly theyll
be coming tonight or in the morning
well have to give em a nice welcome
amos gaunt grinned

  jay rode along in silence it was a
little difficult trying to reconcile sam free-
mans conduct hed looked upon free-
man as his friend-a man who had stood
with him in a gun fight in the streets of
	frontier stories

nebraska city the freeman who was
leading a band of indians against white
men was a different character

if he comes in tonight gaunt said
youd better put him in irons brandon
i dont think hell be in jay told him
back at the corral he summoned malone
and the other teamsters and told them the
news

  we can expect an indian attack any
time jay finished from now till morn-
ing he paused black jack lamonte
will probably be leading it

  priscilla warburton heard the last part
of it and jay saw her mouth tighten

  so hes using indians  she asked when
the bullwhackers had dispersed

  the arapahoes jay said gaunt
thinks hell be able to swing over a lot of
the young bucks from the war party
they want to fight

  can we get a man through to the fort
for aid the girl asked

  jay nodded im sending gaunt out
tonight hes picking out a fast animal
now

  an hour later he shook hands with the
scout and watched him ride out into the
twilight he called malone and frenchy
ledeaux

  how many barrels of oil have we in the
cargo he asked

  malone scratched his mop of hair
maybe five he said

  unload it jay told him quick
oil ledeaux muttered why
monsieur

  get it out jay snapped no man
slept that night when the fires went out
even priscilla warburton sat on the wagon
seat with jay brandon listening for the
slightest sound

  i thought indians didnt attack at
night she said once

  lamonte is leading this attack jay
said hes no respecter of time

  it was after midnight that one of the
guards came in with the news that a party
on horseback was approaching
everything set jay asked

  were ready the bullwhacker whis-
pered

  get inside the wagon jay told the
girl shoot at the first face you see
coming in

priscilla warburton smiled in the dark-

ness ive used a gun before she said
quietly

  jay climbed down and made a quick
round of the corral every man was in his
place a number of them lying on top of the
wagon loads ready to fire at the first charge

  malone popped out of the darkness
theyre cornin he said hoarsely i
saw em dismount in the valley on the
other side o the ridge theyre cornin on
foot

  tell the men to start the fires when
i shoot jay ordered malone raced away
again

the wagon master waited a few
minutes and then lifted his gun and
squeezed the trigger the report echoed
through the night immediately a half
dozen small fires sprang up about thirty
yards distant from the wagon corral

  with incredible speed the fires leaped
along the ground like great snakes in a
moment the different fires had joined
forming a giant ring around the en-
closure

  jay brandon smiled coldly just behind
the fire he could see the figures of advanc-
ing men

  start firing he called sharply rifles
opened up on either side of him he heard
the screams and the high-pitched arapahoe
yell malone trotted up breathlessly

  that oil did it brandon he called
gleefully there aint nobody cornin
through there

  jay crouched down behind the barricade
of boxes theyd erected underneath each
wagon he fired at the flitting figures
beyond the wall of flame fortunately
they had corraled the wagons on an open
plain with patches of short buffalo grass
here and there hed had the men pour the
oil on the bare ground so the fire wouldnt
spread back to the wagons it was work-
ing out to perfection

  if we can hold them off till morning
the wagon master said grimly well be
all right gaunt will be on his way back
with a troop from the fort

  lamontes crew and the arapahoes were
creeping up close behind the flames and
firing through into the enclosure two of
the excelsior teamsters were hit but not
badly jay had them carried into one of
the wagons
freighters west	

  through a section where the fire was
low a half dozen white men suddenly
appeared driving toward the wagons
malone and the fat man bragan crouched
on the ground and opened fire on them
three went down another stumbled
forward on hands and knees while the
remaining two broke and fled back through
the fire

  thatll hold em malone roared
come again you damned renegades

  another man suddenly leaped through
the flames he was dressed in buckskin
holding up his hands he raced forward
yelling at the top of his voice

 jay brandon stared at him dont
fire he cried

  a half-dozen shots from the other side
of the fire followed the running man he
dove over the barricade and sprawled on
the ground inside the corral it was amos
gaunt

  jay brandon helped the man to his feet
gaunt had a bullet wound in the right
arm and the blood was dripping from his
fingers he stared at the wagon master
ruefully and then shook his head

  what happened jay asked

  party o arapahoes chased me gaunt
explained my horse stepped in a gopher
hole and went down with a broken leg i
crawled through the grass and got away
he stared at the ground was no use
try in to git to fort taylor on foot he
finished i thought id come back an try
it agin

  jay shook his head you couldnt get
through now he said quietly theyre
all around us

  i kin make a try the scout told him
stubbornly damn those gophers

  well need every man who can shoot a
gun jay brandon said youd better
stay gaunt he paused see anything
of freeman out there  he asked suddenly

  gaunt laughed coldly i reckon hell
keep himself well hidden the scout
snapped but he might try to sneak in
here an try some more o his tricks

  jay saw to gaunts wound

  there was a lull in the firing and jay
crawled behind the barricade toward ma-
lone he heard priscilla warburtons
voice at his elbow

  you should stay in the wagon he
told her sternly

  i thought i might like to get a few
shots at them she murmured do you
mind 

  no jay grinned good hunting
he was about to pass on when she said

  was it gaunt who came back

  jay blinked his horse fell he said
slowly he came back for another

  but he wont get through will he
brandon she asked quietly

  there was a moment of silence no
jay said truthfully im not going to
risk him again

 how many men has lamonte with
him priscilla asked calmly

  jay shrugged possibly a hundred and
fifty or two hundred he said well hold
them off already he noted the flames
were dying down as the oil in the ground
was consumed it would probably last till
morning but after that they would have
to think of something else

  four to one miss warburton said
i wish you luck mr brandon

  jay looked at her steadily you have
a pistol he asked she was carrying a
springfield rifle in her hand

  she took from her dress a small black
derringer

  keep one bullet in it all the time
jay said

  lamontes a white man priscilla war-
burton murmured

  not out here jay told her hes
redder than those arapahoes hed seen
lamontes face once as the big man led
a party of his teamsters around the far
side of the corral black jack lamonte
was in his element fighting with the red
men if were wiped out jay concluded
itll be blamed on the arapahoes la-
monte wont want any survivors

the false dawn came up as the fire
flickered out on the prairie the forty-
five excelsior teamsters crouched behind
the barricade and peered into the semi-
darkness

  jay heard lamonte calling to some of
his men get ready for a charge jay
yelled

  gaunt shook his head hed be a fool
to try it on foot now the scout ex-
plained theyll go back for their
horses

  jay brandon watched the red come into
	frontier stories

the sky he could make out the dark
figures out on the prairie

  im ready to go agin gaunt said
softly

  jay hesitated i dont like to send a
man out to die he objected

  well be dyin either way gaunt
chuckled an if i git through theres a
chance fer all of us

  jay stared at priscilla warburton crouch-
ing behind a wall of boxes several yards
away

  all right gaunt he said softly pick
out your horse

  the scout slipped away he came back
a few minutes later and pressed jays
hand

  good luck the wagon master mur-
mured

  i figger to git through this time gaunt
said grimly with any luck ill get back
afore nightfall hold em off brandon

  jay nodded it was a long time till
nightfall he watched gaunt slip into the
saddle and then he knocked a few of the
boxes down the scout leaped his mount
through the gap and shot out of the corral

  jay listened to the drive of hoof beats
he watched gaunt as he rode through a
gap between the dark figures on the prairie
there were a half dozen shots and then
amos gaunts high-pitched yell jay wasnt
sure whether it was caused by pain or
elation at getting through after that
the silence

  lamonte came back with the first rays
of the sun jay watched the line of riders
trotting down from the nearby slope with
two hundred men at his command lamonte
intended to ride right over the fortifica-
tions once inside the rest would be
easy

 get ready jay called he heard
priscilla warburtons gun hammer click
she smiled at him and he saw the black
derringer within reach of her hand

  the first wave of riders hit them with
terrific impact wisely lamonte had per-
mitted the arapahoes to ride in the fore
and the anxious young bucks rode to within
twenty-five yards of the enclosure before
the deadly fire of the teamsters halted
them dozens were strewn on the ground
screaming amongst the kicking animals

 behind the arapahoes came lamonte
and cole hartman riding together with

the fifty bullwhackers behind them some
of them came through the corral driving
over the opening of the horseshoe which
had been barricaded with cases of food-
stuffs

  jay brandon raced toward the spot he
was almost knocked down by hartmans
horse-a big black gelding hartmans
gun flamed in his hand and jay felt the
impact of the bullet in his left shoulder
he shot twice with his six-shooter and the
gelding galloped in among the bawling cat-
tle riderless

  malone ledeaux and bragan were at
the gap swinging the stocks of their rifles
as a dozen lamonte teamsters tried to
come through jay saw malone pick up
one man bodily and hurl him through the
air lamonte himself was only a dozen
yards away calling for the arapahoes to
come on again

  jay flashed a shot at him but missed
a score of excelsior men raced down from
the other end of the corral firing as they
came the battle at the breached section
ended suddenly

  frenchy ledeaux leaped over the barri-
cade a long green river knife in his
hand jay saw it gleam in the early morn-
ing sun as the french canuck landed on
the back of a retreating lamonte bull-
whacker

  ledeauxs right arm rose and fell twice
there was blood on the long blade when
the frenchman came back a man with a
mop of bushy red hair lay on his face the
back of his dirty white shirt staining red
it was flannigan

  hold your fire jay called lamonte
and his men were retreating rapidly they
pulled up out of rifle range

  malone sat down on the ground and
wiped the sweat from his face he looked
at jay brandon and grinned ledeaux
calmly wiped his knife on the leg of his
pants

  i reckon thatll hold em for a spell
malone chuckled

  theyll be back jay murmured he
sat down beside priscilla warburton the
girls face was stained with gun powder

  it was pretty close jay she said

  the wagon master nodded three of
his teamsters were dead and another eight
wounded they wouldnt be as strong for
the next charge
freighters west	

  out on the plain lamonte was having a
conference with the arapahoe chiefs

  them injuns like to talk malone
grinned i hope they talk all mornin

it was another hour and a half before
lamonte could get his men lined up
for another drive jay brandon glanced
up at the sun it was still two hours be-
fore noon and amos gaunt wouldnt be
able to get back before nightfall-if he
got back at all

  whatever happens after this charge
priscilla warburton broke in on his
thoughts ill know one thing jay

  whats that brandon asked curiously
he felt the blood sliding down his arm

  youre a man she said softly

  jay grinned and youre a woman
he said a woman id like to see more
of if we ever get out of here

  if that were the only reason miss
warburton told him calmly i hope we
make it

  then lamonte was coming again the
arapahoes on the left and the white team-
sters on the right-a long line of them
spreading out thinly as they kicked their
mounts into a fast gallop

  in another moment they were moving at
top speed aiming again for the open end
of the horseshoe jay brandon crouched
behind the barricade and fired steadily
he watched lamonte fired and missed
again directly behind the big mans
shoulder he thought he saw a movement
up on the ridge

  then the arapahoes were down on them
screaming shrilly driving their painted
ponies straight for the gap jay emptied
his six-shooter into a mob of them knock-

ing down four he whipped another gun
from his belt and then sprang over to
where priscilla warburton was standing

  they were coming through now kicking
over the boxes and cases the remaining
excelsior teamsters were all down at the
breach firing at the arapahoes dragging
them from the saddles

  lamonte himself hurdled the wall
charging his big chestnut animal straight
at jay brandon the excelsior wagon
master waited for him he fired one shot
at an arapahoe with a lance running for
him the indian went down

  lamonte had his gun out his face was
twisted more devilish than that of the
indians tibbs bragan leaped for the
big mans bridle and tried to stop the horse

  jay shot a bullet into the animals chest
and the chestnut stumbled forward a few
yards from him lamonte leaped clear
of the saddle landing like a cat on his feet
his gun was directed at the excelsior
wagon master when jay squeezed the trig-
ger

  the slug knocked lamontes gun arm
down the colt falling to the ground the
big man scooped it up with his left hand
and came in again on the run the colt
barked and jay felt the bullet slam into
the wagon behind him he shot aiming
for lamontes wide waist

  the bullet stopped lamonte for a mo-
ment but he came on again like a great
grizzly bear reaching forward to hug
his man jay squeezed the trigger and
the hammer fell on an empty cylinder

  lamonte piled on top of him driving
him to the ground then quite suddenly
the big man grew limp jay rolled him off
he saw death staring out of lamontes

eyes the hilt of a knife protruded from
the big mans back as he lay on his face
priscilla warburton stood a few feet away
face white and terror-stricken

  jay leaped forward and wrenched the
colt from lamontes fingers he turned
it on the men stim coming through the
gap directly behind them he saw a line
of blue-coated riders he heard malone
yelling insanely

  troopers the bullwhacker was roar-
ing

  amos gaunt rode at the head of the
column of blue-clad men another man
rode with him jay brandon stared it

end of the corral they broke through be-
tween two of the wagons and fled across the
plains

 amos gaunt threw himself from his
horse and raced toward jay brandon
lamontes teamsters were trying to get
away but the troopers rounded them up
quickly

  jay sat down on a box lamontes gun
still in his hand the fight was over

jack lamonte

the wooing of baptiste

 by mark howe

  never was there a stranger courtship than that of baptiste doriot
  pauper of the beaver streams utes had taken his partner his traps and
  his pelts and there was no credit at the fur mens rendezvous

baptiste doriot rode into the
rendezvous at browns hole at the
tail of kit carsons outfit with bitter-
ness in his soul to be sure he was glad
to be there as well he might be meeting

old friends who ranged the beaver streams
from the gila to the yellowstone would be
pleasant but in spite of that he chewed the
bitter cud of disappointment

  the size of baptistes pack of beaver




frontier stories

pelts was the cause of it all never before
in his years of independent trapping had
he appeared at rendezvous with so little
to show for his work he knew it wasnt
his fault but nevertheless his soul was
steeped in bitterness

  too little beaver and too much indian
accounted for his state of mind the fall
before he and his partner lafe stevens
made a bad guess as to trapping grounds
the streams at the headwaters of the north
platte where they first set their traps
yielded only a few pelts then with the
season half gone they traveled fifty miles
south to the upper colorado here beaver
were plentiful enough to glut the avarice
of the most greedy man in the business
they built a small cabin in happy haste
and settled themselves down to reap a rich
harvest but there was something else in
that region besides beaver ute indians
who fiercely resented the white mans inva-
sion of their hunting grounds were there
also

  about noon one day when baptiste was
out doing double duty on the trap line
they attacked the cabin where lafe was
laid up with a badly sprained ankle he
fought them off as long as he could but
soon went under on his way home about
dusk baptiste heard the singing of the
triumphant indians knew what it meant
and fled westward along the river on the
way he picked up half a dozen traps all
he dared to try to save

  for two days and night he rode without
a halt except for a few minutes at a time
to let his jaded pack-mule drink and graze
after a weeks hard travel he reached the
junction of the colorado and gunnison
rivers where he found kit carson lucien
maxwell and a dozen others snugly cabined
for the winter with typical trapper hos-
pitality they took him in gave him food and
shelter and let him set his traps on the
streams they were working

  the company of old friends was pleasant
and the trapping good but the season was
nearly over already his hosts were talking
about going to rendezvous at browns
hole by dint of much labor and a little
help from his sympathetic friends baptiste
got all the pelts his mule could carry in
addition to his own weight but that was
all compared to the catch the others had
made these were nothing they would be

in real money when they arrived at ren-
dezvous but he would have barely enough
for a few additional traps powder and
lead tobacco and a little whiskey which
would have to be stretched to the farthest
endurable limit by the addition of plain
water

  enfant de garce-how he hated diluted
whiskey

  although burning with thirst he wisely
postponed gratifying it until he had pro-
vided the necessities of his trade half a
dozen traps powder lead and tobacco cost
so much he had to throw in his mule by
dint of much wheedling he managed to
persuade trader william bent to add a
gallon jug of watery whiskey providing
he would bring the jug back when it was
empty

  forlorn and more bitter than ever he
sought the outskirts of the rendezvous and
built himself a shabby little wickiup and
buried his outfit beneath it his first im-
pulse was to empty the jug down his throat
in the shortest possible time that he
knew from past experience was the surest
means of forgetting his troubles and dis-
appointments for a few hours his better
wiser self however sternly interposed the
remainder that there would positively be
no more when that was gone that caused
him to institute a rigid system of rationing

  next morning he set out to find a part-
ner to take the place of lafe stevens whose
scalp was now being carefully dried in a
ute lodge the kind of man he sought
would probably be hard to find one with
plenty of cash or credit with william bent
horses and pack-mules and a generous dis-
position was needed if he failed to find
this man the only alternative was to hire
himself out to some bourgeois like thomas
fitzpatrick or ewing young

  kit carson was the first man he ap-
proached on the subject we-e-- now
baptiste drawled kit in his soft ken-
tucky voice im plumb sorry but i
reckon youre too late my partys already
made up soon as were through tradin
were lightin out for the yellowstone

  for three days baptiste diligently inter-
viewed everybody he knew and some he
didnt with only an occasional nip from the
jug to bolster up his courage what he
feared became a stark reality nobody
wanted to throw in with him and make up
the wooing

the deficiencies in his outfit late in the
afternoon of the third day of fruitless effort
he crawled into his wickiup flung himself
upon his blankets and growled out his
disgust

  sacre enfants des garees he fumed
utes grande rascal pouf i take his top-
knot when once more we meet just like
zat

  when his rage had burned itself down
to a puny helpless resentment against
everything and everybody he crawled out-
side and sat down upon the ground beside
the entrance now he noticed things in
the vicinity had changed since morning
a band of arapaho indians had come in
and pitched their lodges a hundred yards
or so away near a creek bank although
these particular savages had always been
friendly to white men he was now in no
mood to remember that or give them credit
for it

  all indian grande rascal he muttered
as he watched them going quietly about
their business

  presntly he saw his friend old six
feathers sitting cross-legged beside the
door of his lodge sacre growled bap-
tiste he grand rascal too but i go talk
wit him anyhow

six feathers was glad to see him
and made him sit down upon the ground
for a pow-wow for some time they sat
there talking in a desultory fashion about
the price of beaver tobacco whiskey and
how stingy william bent was presently a
young squaw walked past on her way to
the creek with a tin kettle in her hand

  enfant de garcei rumbled baptiste
softly his black beard bristling with excite-
ment what is her name

  six feathers chuckled understandingly
he well knew the ways of men especially
mountain men unami he replied
daughter of eagle head

  baptiste spoke quickly

  married

  the old indian knew this would be the
next question no said he sourly wont
look at arapaho warrior

  bidding his friend a somewhat hasty and
unceremonious goodbye baptiste casually
sauntered down toward the creek six
feathers watched him for a moment an
amused expression in his crafty old eyes

of baptiste	

then grunted sarcastically got up and went
inside his lodge

  at the creek baptiste found unami sit-
ting upon a stone peering at her face as
mirrored in the water boldly sitting down
beside her he also looked at the image
you are ze prettiest squaw i ever saw
he remarked in a mixture of french and
bad arapaho

  unamis only reply was a delighted

giggle-	

  thus encouraged baptiste pursued his
line of thought you make ze lodge
warm he complimented

  does black beard think so she coyly
inquired

  certainment was the enthusiastic re-
ply you make ze robe soft with little
fingers ze lodge you keep for your man
will be warm and clean

  unami dipped her kettle into the water
rose to her feet and made as if to go

 you come back in ze morning
pleaded baptiste

  the girl made no reply but laughed
self consciously and walked up the bank

  at the top she stopped to look back over
her shoulder with eyes which set the trap-
pers soul aflame in ze morning at
evening at zis time he no longer in-
vited he implored

  unamis eyes dreamily caressed his fig-
ure for an instant in the morning when
the sun peeps over the mountain i come
here for water if black beard is on hand
unami cant help it if he looks at her

  for the first time since the utes rubbed
out lafe stevens baptiste was his usual
gay carefree self as he walked toward
the center of the rendezvous where wil-
liam bents tent stood he hummed a gay
chanson to himself while he sang he
revolved matters swiftly in his mind

  never before had he been inclined to
take a squaw into his lodge now his
volatile impulsive nature responded to
every glance movement and line of the
indian girls body with him an impulse
was usually a brief prelude to action he
had looked upon unami found her de-
lectable and that ended the matter he
would have her for his wife

  to his great satisfaction he found wil-
liam bent in his tent alone monsieur
bent he said with simple directness
the utes kill my partner and steal ze furs


frontier stories

i	ride and ride my mule nearly drop
then one day voila there is kit carson
he take poor baptiste in and show him
where to set ze trap catch a few beaver-
bring heem in and trade wit you got plenty
powder lead and tobac but no horse it
ees long way to trap country baptiste feet
get tired will monsieur bent let him have
two horse and two mules on ze credit til
next rendezvous

  william bents- kindly eyes twinkled
humorously ive heard at least twenty
other stories of that kind he said
theres tom wheeler jack smith and a
whole passel of others in the same fix
they say theyre broke too

  baptistes heart turned to lead in his
bosom but monsieur bent he ex-
claimed you have let baptiste have ze
credit before and lost nozzing he pay his
debts like a bourgeois

  i stake nobody except married men
explained bent so you see that lets you
out

  baptistes eyes narrowed you give
baptiste ze credit if he had ze squaw to
keep his lodge he inquired

  william bent slid headlong into a trap
of whose existence he knew nothing yes
he chuckled if you had a squaw you
could have two horses and a couple of pack-
mules

   baptiste leaped into the air landed along-
side the trader seized him in a bear-like
hug and planted a kiss upon either cheek

  sacre he crowed you are one
grande bourgeois

  as the happy french-canadian walked
out of the tent bent flung another word
after him remember now he warned
no squaw no horse

  out laughed baptiste i onnerstand
next morning he met unami at the usual
place on the creek where it took a long
time to fill the kettle with water they
met in the same place again late in the
afternoon and that night they sat upon
the ground near the creek bank under
baptistes blanket for a long time thus
matters went for ten days then he de-
cided it was time to bring matters to an
issue back to william bent he went

  one horse now he pleaded ze ozzer
and ze mules when i am ready to go to
trap country

  the trader was adamant no wife no

horse poor baptiste was in a bad fix
since savage etiquette demanded a price
for unami he had to do something with
william bent in his present mood there was
nothing to do except to go on a hunt al-
though pelts were not at their best at that
season that night he dug up his outfit
made it into a pack and was off at dawn the
next day

  for almost a month he hunted and
trapped with feverish energy when he
was ready to go back to the rendezvous he
cached his outfit shouldered his pelts and
set out on the night after his arrival he
carried his bundle of second-rate pelts to
eagle heads lodge placed them just in-
side the entrance then crossed to the far
side and sat down beside unami

  as eagle head undid the bundle and
critically examine its contents the young
people watched him eagerly baptiste
found unamis hand and held it tight if
the offering of pelts was satisfactory eagle
head would throw his buffalo robe over
their heads and they would be man and
wife if it were not he would throw the
bundle outside

  to the young people it seemed that eagle
head would never complete his inspection
they scarcely breathed as they waited
presently he rose uttered a deep grunt of
dissatisfaction and kicked the bundle
through the doorway the young peoples
hands slowly untwined and baptiste rose
to go

  courage my little one he murmured
i hunt some more

  eagle head turned his back upon the
suitor as he walked across the lodge out-
side baptiste met walking wolf unamis
brother my father is not pleased in-
quired the young warrior as he watched
baptiste gather up his pelts

  sacre  growled baptiste he ees vair
mooch angry

  more pelts will help suggested walk-
ing wolf he had always been fond of
the french-canadian

  that is what i onnerstand dryly com-
mented baptiste as he walked disconso-
lately away

next morning long before dawn bap-
tiste was on his way back to his
cache bitter indeed were his thoughts
now for before he could collect another
the wooing

lot of pelts and return william bent might
go back to his fort on the arkansas river
or the arapahos might take it into their
heads to move if either happened his
chance of winning unami would be gone
for another year at least if not altogether

  still in a bitter frame of mind he reached
his cache dug up his outfit and began to
set his traps again the stream he had
chosen for operations led back into a nar-
row thickly wooded gorge he had never
visited before while making his rounds
one morning nearly a mpnth later he went
farther than usual in a little nook he
found a lodge containing a green buffalo
head six tin kettles an equal number of
blankets and a pile of perhaps three dozen
green beaver pelts from the poles hung
a variety of articles including a large red
pipe several bows and quivers of arrows
half a dozen flint hatchets and a like num-
ber of round bull-hide shields

  a single glance sufficed to identify the
place as a medicine lodge erected by
arapaho young men who were out to win
the right to be called warriors the ar-
ticles were offerings and the lodge to-
gether with all it contained was held sacred
the penalty for disturbing it in any fashion
was death

  baptiste gazed upon the contents of the
lodge with something more than curiosity
here were riches far greater than any he
might hope to secure in the short time re-
maining to him apparently no one was
near and the young men to whom it be-
longed might not return for days why
not-

  baptistes waywlard meditations were
rudely interrupted by a hand upon his
shoulder leaping to one side he whipped
out his knife and whirled to face whoever
the owner of it might be to his astonish-
ment he found himself looking into the
smiling face of walking wolf

  black beard is very nervous re-
marked the indian lad he also rises
early

  baptiste sheathed his knife and advanced
with outstretched hand oui he replied
i rise early because i sleep in a lonely
lodge if i had your sister for ze wife i
would not have to go out before ze sun
comes up

  walking wolf gravely took the out-
stretched hand a moment later half a

of baptiste	

dozen other young arapahos entered the
lodge and shook hands with him he could
also hear the voices of others outside

  what brings the young arapahos into
ze mountains inquired baptiste

  we have vowed to the great spirit that
we will be men and warriors explained
walking wolf but our hatchets have not
yet been raised against an enemy the
cowardly blackfeet are dogs they hide
in their holes we cannot go home until
we have sprinkled our blankets with the
blood of an enemy

  baptiste understood all this but did not
like the sound of it he well knew that
young men bent upon such a mission were
not averse to straining a few points in one
way or another for the moment they
were friendly enough but he was white and
they wanted to go home

  come with us invited walking wolf
and share our poor lodge it is not far
off

  baptiste was reluctant to accept the in-
vitation but there was no way to avoid it
to decline would give offense seeing their
apparent mood he had no wish to injure
their feelings since there was nothing
else to do he followed his hosts whom he
found to be about twenty in number to their
camp farther up the gorge upon arriv-
ing there they sat about roasting a deer
some of them had brought in

  during the remainder of the day they
lounged about camp baptiste thought of
his traps but there was no way of escap-
ing his hosts without causing trouble
along in the afternoon he noticed that
something was wrong many whispered
conversations were held by the young men
and an air of hositility pervaded the place
when he could bear it no longer he ap-
proached walking wolf who sat apart
from the others upon a log

  why have ze hearts of ze arapahos
grown cold toward me he inquired

  they are far from home and their vows
are unfulfilled replied walking wolf
bluntly your skin is white therefore
you are an enemy they say we should kill
you sprinkle your blood upon our blankets
and go back

  poor baptiste was paralyzed with horror
at this but ze arapahos are my friends
he protested surely zey would not think
of such a thing
	frontier

  i have spoken said walking wolf
baptiste swiftly revolved the situation in
his mind his rifle lay upon the opposite
side of the camp between him and it sat
the young men strategy therefore was
his only reliance

  look walking wolf said he softly
my heart is heavy because ze araphahos
have not stained their blankets let me
help zem if zey kill me zey will fulfill ze
vow but zey will kill a brother who loves
zem zat is not good let me give a bit
of my blood zat zey may go home and
find wives i will take unami and every-
body will be happy

  walking wolf sat as though he had not
heard while the others put their heads
close together suddenly they rose
whipped out their knives and walked to-
ward baptiste the french-canadian
knowing the dread moment had come
seized his knife with a determination to
fight to the last

walking wolf also rose to his
feet brothers he shouted wait
a moment hear me the arapahos are
brave but a cloud has come between them
and the sun we cannot find the blackfeet
and there are no scalps in our medicine
lodge today the great spirit is kind
he sent us a white man a friend who is
the suitor for unami if you kill him she
will weep and all arapaho maidens will
weep with her they will be so angry with
us we cannot find wives the old men will
laugh at us and say we were afraid to trail
an enemy and lifted our hands against a
friend

  but our vow cried one of the young
men we cannot go home without
sprinkling the blood of an enemy upon our
blankets here is one let us kill him
and be off

  a chorus of assenting howls was raised
at this once more they started forward

  wait commanded walking wolf i
have not forgotten our vow if you will
listen to me we can fulfill it and all go
home with light hearts black beard is
very full of blood he can easily spare
enough to stain all our blankets when
that is done we will go home

  after a moments silence the young men
burst into a gabble of talk presntly they
all put their knives away and one of them

 stories

stepped forward it is good said he
we will do as you say

  preparations for instantly putting the
project into effect were made one of the
young men ran for a tin cup while bap-
tiste heroically bared his left arm walk-
ing wolf coolly pinched up the skin some
three inches below the elbow and deftly
drew his razor-edged knife across it from
an inch-long wound the blood spurted
freely into the tin cup

  when the vessel was two-thirds full
walking wolf motioned them away bap-
tiste placed a wad of tobacco upon the
wound and bound it with a strip of soft
deer-skin then they tenderly led him to
the medicine lodge where they made him
a bed of buffalo robes the young men
spent the remainder of the afternoon in
making preparations for a celebration

  that night the young braves danced the
age-old ceremony to honor the shedding
of the blood of an enemy for the first time
about the hour of midnight they com-
pleted it and sought their beds exhausted
in body but exalted in mind next morn-
ing they were astir at an early hour mak-
ing preparations to return home baptiste
watched them with a feeling of loneliness
in his heart after all now that the mat-
ter of his being an enemy was settled he
regretted to see them go it would be
very lonely without them

  just before setting out for home the
young warriors held a low-voiced con-
versation when they were through they
went away toward the medicine lodge lead-
ing one of the horses after about an
hours absence they returned with the lodge
and its contents upon the animals back
taking it to where baptiste sat dejectedly
upon a log walking wolf spoke for all of
them

  black beard has been very good to us
and our hearts are warm toward him
said he we beg him to accept this horse
and what is upon his back as proof of our
love for him

  baptiste was dazzled for this gift repre-
sented more wealth than the results of a
whole seasons trapping on the best stream
in the mountains now he could go back
to the rendezvous and claim unami my
brothers are generous he said if zey
will wait for me to gather up ze traps i
will go home wit zem
the wooing

  for the remainder of the day everybody
worked diligently getting baptistes outfit
together when night came on they set
guards about the camp rolled up in blankets
and slept like wolverines when they set
out for home the next morning his heart
sang with joy every time he thought about
the riches upon the back of his newly ac-
quired horse

  when he arrived at the rendezvous he
was made still happier by learning that
both william bent and the arapahos were
still there that night he tethered his
horse outside eagle heads lodge went in-
side and sat down beside unami in due
course of time which seemed long to the
lovers eagle head leisurely got to his feet
and went outside to inspect the animal

  for fully three-quarters of an hour he
viewed the animal from every angle dur-
ing this time baptiste and unami leaned
heavily against each other with fingers
interlocked to them it seemed he never
would return to announce his decision
they grew numb and ceased to think
time the world of events-everything
seemed to fade into a blur

of baptiste	

  unamis eyes glowed with hope

  when eagle head reappeared he seemed
unreal to baptiste-a phantom moving in
a tenuous fog with slow dignified tread
his arms crossed upon his bosom he crossed
the lodge and stood directly over them for
a moment he stood there like some lofty
cloud-crested mountain peak then with
unhurried movement he unfolded his arms
and extended them benignly over the young
people

   it is good my children he said in deep
tones may the great spirit watch over
your lodge

  having said this he removed his robe
from his shoulders swung it out upon the
air and allowed it to settle upon their heads
like a gentle benediction as the soft
caressing folds shut the lovers into a world
entirely their own eagle head quitted the
lodge lowered the flap at the entrance and
securely fastened it with a feeling of
joyous contentment in his heart which
must have been akin to that which filled the
great spirit after he brought the first man
and woman together he untied the horse
and led it away

kate

by jerome parker

a frontier
outlaw feature

only the owlhoot brotherhood knew
that pretty ella watsons lonely cabin
was the clearing house for a rustler
crew

velvet-black night softly
smothered sweetwater valley a
thousand stars flashed their glittering
points all across the heavens and off the
plain there came the sharp sweet smell of
sage heavy in this thin air

  lamplight butter-yellow spilled out of
the windows of a single lonely cabin set in
the middle of the prairie a woman came
out of this cabin backed against its wall
waiting she carried a winchester the
sound she had heard grew-the low thun-
der of a fast-traveling herd of cattle pres-
ently the bunched cattle mostly calves
drifted into the yard held in a tight circle
by three riders one of them moved for-
ward calling ella

  the woman spoke with authority its
all right luke have your boys put the
stuff in the corral they can brand em in
the morning

  the man luke dropped a few short sen-
tences to his riders whereupon they circled
the cabin driving the cattle ahead of them
into the corral back of the cabin after-
ward luke came to ella watson he was
chuckling at some secret joke he did not
get down some of durbins stuff he
said then jim up at the store and
receiving the womans answer explained
want to talk with him be down in the
mornin and moved off with his riders

  before she went into the cabin ella
watson took a turn around the corral
smiling to herself as she viewed by lantern
light the wealth represented here under the
soft silky coats of the young calves

  this was the sweetwater valley wyom-



ella drew her gun ill kill the man who
opens that gate j

ing territory in the spring of  ella
watson and jim averell were partners in
one of the most audacious and ingenious
rustling schemes ever fostered on the range

  jim averell clever and completely un-
scrupulous kept a store post office and
saloon in the valley he was also a sage-
brush politician representing the little
ranchers and homesteaders in their fight
against the cattle barons-men he termed
land sharks privately averell had no
true sentiment in the matter he stood
ready to profit whichever way the decision
should fall it might be that the cattle
kings would pay well to rid themselves of
such a trouble-maker or and with each
day averell thought this the more likely
turn the small stockmen would gain power
granting him a high position as a leader
of their faction

  ella watson was averells cover-up in
the rustling game with which he marked
time a pretty and warm-hearted and
reckless woman of the frontier cow-
towns she had drifted to a cheyenne
dance hall where averell met her in his
search for a woman to aid his plan averell
could be agreeable and entertaining he
had a cloak of charm and culture that
captured ella

  back to the sweetwater came ella to
set up a hog ranch in the valley she
took cows in payment if money was lack-
ing and in its easy tolerance the cow coun-
try of wyoming gave her the cognomen
of cattle kate it was afterward to
have a sinister meaning

  for ellas corral served as a clearing
house for the rustlers on jim averells
payroll the stolen stock was mixed with
that taken in trade and though the en-
closure was always filled with twenty to
fifty animals bearing various brands no
suspicion was attached to the fact since
the manner in which ella conducted her
business was well known she had no
competition for fifty miles around and
the country held a large population of
salty cowhands there were times when
she had one or two girls to assist in the
entertainment occasional shooting scrapes
arose but ella was handy enough with
a six-gun to show her rambunctious cus-
tomers that she meant business

ella watson rose early to watch
the branding she dressed quickly
standing before her mirror she was
pleased with what she saw there she
was a pretty and disturbing woman deep-
bosomed and broad-hipped

  it was when she was buckling on her
six-gun pondering her need for it that
her old doubts came back that the val-
ley was becoming suspicious she knew as
she dashed over the prairie in her shiny
new buggy dressed in gay silks of the
latest eastern fashion or atop her fine
blooded saddle horse she could not help
but observe the dark looks of her neigh-
bors the sullen muttering of the hard-
worked men the jealous and hostile

hank wheeler allowed himself a chuckle

mbetter start shootm

glances of the women at the time she
flouted them with a toss of her head but
later alone she was not so sure of her-
self

   this reverie was cut short by the clip-
clop announcement of riders coming into
the yard she gave a final pat to her
hair smoothed her long skirt and went
to the door expecting to see jim averell
and luke and his men there was a lift
to the anticipation but she was disap-
pointed

  she found the riders four of them
sitting their horses by the corral sliding
their glances in and out among the bawling
animals these were hank wheeler fore-
man for john durbin and three hands
they were grim and deeply angry

   hank wheeler declared ella our calf
herd was raided last night an we have


	frontier stories

reason to think the stock was driven here
whut you know about it

  ella watson maintained her tough
calm the six-gun was a reassuring
weight on her hip she answered i
know nothing about it these are my
cattle and this is my land youre tres-
passin clear out

  hank wheeler grinned without humor
we have put up with you long enough
ella it is time for the cattlemen in this
valley to act

  then he seemed angry with himself for
having said too much he made an im-
patient gesture said to one of his hands
open up thet gate ben well drive
this stuff home with us

  ella watsons command halted the man
before he left the saddle her voice was
just loud enough to be heard and there was
a quality in it that made all these men
stare at her as though they had seen her
for the first time

  ill kill the man who touches that gate
hank wheeler allowed himself a chuckle
never mind ben ill tend to it my-
self

  he got down slowly stretched when he
was on the ground commenced rolling a
cigarette letting the lapse of time play
on the womans nerves he touched a
match to the brown quirly regarded the
first stream of smoke thoughtfully drawled
better start shootin ella and walked
with deliberately slow steps toward the
corral gate

  when his hand was on the rawhide
strips that held the gate shut ella watson
murmured youre a fool hank and
drew her gun without haste and fired
hitting the foreman in the shoulder which
was her intention

  the heavy bullet knocked hank wheeler
backward spilling him in the dust he
rose to his knees clutching at his shoul-
der cursing pain twisted his face the
other three punchers fought their fright-
ened horses around the yard

  damn you ella damn you

  wheeler said it over and over unable
to think of anything else ella watson
exclaimed watching his men get on your
horse hank and get out of here maybe
next time i wont feel so charitable
one of the hands helped wheeler to
mount he pulled his horse around fling-

ing at ella watson a look of pure hatred
crying out a woman like you deserves
no pity an you will get none when the
time comes

  then they were gone in a skittering
cloud of dust

  reaction seized ella watson turned her
faint and weak made the gun a dead weight
in her hand she sat down on a rude
bench by the cabin holding the gun in
her lap as she remembered hank
wheelers warning some of the brightness
went out of the day for her made her
long for the sight of jim averell long to
hear his reassuring promises for the
future

  she was like this caught by faint
dreams when jim averell and luke and
the other men of the night before trotted
into the yard averell noticing the gun
her white face went to her immediately
asking honey whats wrong

  he was a tall blond half-handsome
man with features a trifle sharp and
muddy-colored eyes that somehow without
being shifty did not inspire trust but
he was an educated man of some culture
and one who on the rough frontier could
easily find favor with women ella wat-
son loved him completely she said now
hank wheeler and some of his men were
here they were going to drive off the
stock i had to shoot wheeler she
shivered a little

  jim averell who played his part with
this woman with an actors finesse showed
deep concern he cursed durbin and
durbins outfit swore vengeance by in-
creased raids on durbins stock mentally
he congratulated himself on choosing such
a capable partner for his rustling scheme

  he murmured youre upset you need
a drink he took her into the cabin with
him

  the liquor brought color back to ella
watsons cheeks loosened her made her
regard averell with fond half-shut eyes
he was stirred by her and took her in his
arms whispering youre wonderful
ella

  he saw her eyes widen her lips part
a little the heady fragrance of her hair
was all about him he kissed her

  outside the man luke carried on the
branding he gave a broad wink to his
helpers
cattle kate



summer saw averell continue his calf
raids with success then in june
he led his men on a daring foray against
rob connors ranch on a clear moon-
lit night they swooped down on connors
herd ready to carry out their usual busi-
ness of shooting the cows and driving off
the youngsters

  but the herd turned out to be too well
guarded it was actually an ambush and
averell lost two of his men brought back
a third wounded lashed across his saddle
near dawn after a long running fight
they reached ella watsons cabin

  ella ran out to them experiencing a
thrill of fear as she saw the wounded man
dragged from his saddle then she saw
jim averell and ran to him jim what
happened 

  averell forgot his pose he jerked a
thumb at the man being carried inside
answered curtly what does it look like
there was a fight we had to run for it
ella watson asked humbly who was
hit she knew most of these men and
liked them and performed small tasks for
them

  a new man-pete rivers

  she received this soberly ill see
what i can do for him

  they had lain the man in a wall bunk
and luke and another man were standing
by him undecided what to do ella wat-
son pushed them aside

  get me some hot water its on the
stove in the back room and some clean
linen from the cabinet under the window
hurry

  the men responded to her orders mov-
ing clumsily in their haste averell paced
up and down the room never giving the
wounded man a look

  ella watson knew as soon as she bent
over the man that he was beyond hope
sight of the dark gaping hole in his chest
its welling fountain of blood paralyzed
her for a moment with quick skill she
attempted to staunch the flow almost ten-
derly she smoothed back the damp hair
from the closed eyes however her life
on the frontier in the raw cowtowns had
hardened her it had not inured her to the
sight of death and suffering

  she took the hot water and cloths when
they came tried to clean and bandage the

-frontier stories-fall

wound jim averells voice talking to

luke reached her as she worked

  he was in a temper unusual for him
and smashed a fist into his palm to empha-
size his talk

  something went wrong they knew we
were coming they were waiting for us
it was a perfect ambush

  ella watson caught herself wondering
with him and then as she ripped away
the mans shirt to get a better view of
the wound she found the badge it came
loose in her hand lay glittering in her
palm riveting her fascinated gaze she
read the lettering on it-tracing the words
out with soundless lips wyoming stock-
growers association cheyenne stock
detective memory flooded her brain
she remembered stories she had heard of
these mysterious private lawmen - this
man was a range detective

  she became aware of a strange hush in
the room a shadow fell across the bunk
and she looked up to discover jim averells
burning gaze bent upon her give it to
me he demanded harshly and she handed
up the badge without question

  he was laughing exultantly as he showed
the badge around his laughter riding the
exclamations of amazement from his crew
but there was something in the laugh that
ella watson did not like she could not
remember ever having seen him this way
so completely full of anger-of anger over-
laid with fear

  heres our answer he exclaimed a
spy for the cattlemen riding with us a
range detective he tipped them off let
them know we were coming and they
have saved us the trouble of shooting him
ella watson received a shock when she
turned back to the man in the bunk his
eyes were open looking beyond her at
the knot of men under the oil lamp his
gaze dropped to her he coughed a little
and crimson froth brightened the stubble
of his beard he spoke in a very low
voice

  you must be cattle kate

  she nodded

  he managed a grin you dont look
half as bad as youre painted they told
me in cheyenne you had horns

  she smiled in spite of herself

  they know what i am  he turned his
head to one side
	frontier stories

  she said yes in a very small voice
he closed his eyes as if gathering his
strength for the effort of talking

  that dont matter now my job is
finished im obliged maam for your
kind attention maybe i can repay it
there is somethin you ought to know
about jim averell  j 

  she was hauled abruptly viciously to
her feet meeting the full terrible impact
f the malevolent hatred in jim averells
look the murderous fury in the depths of
his strange-colored eyes

  keep away from that treacherous dog
he hissed until ive decided what to do
with him

  he threw her into one of the rawhide-
backed chairs continued his pacing up and
down the room

  with an effort averell reached for con-
trol almost casually he forced himself
to say luke you and jim get a spade
dig a grave well bury him

  horror flickered in ella watsons eyes
she sat on the edge of the chair still hold-
ing a bloody piece of linen her dress was
blood-stained

  it was the first time she had ever seen
the man luke show surprise he showed
it now surprise and something else a
thinly disguised contempt

  he aint dead yet

  averell looked at luke pityingly then
while an unvoiced scream bubbled in ella
watsons throat he walked over to the
bunk looked down at the man there drew
his gun and targeted the muzzle between
the eyes flame gouted from the barrel
the explosion rocked the little room set-
ting up ringing echoes powder smoke made
its stench the mans face was burned
black from the blast his eyes remained
open

  averell sheathed the gun said to luke
that make you feel better

  luke ignored him deliberately signaled
to the other two men they rolled the
body in a blanket ajid went out luke
rummaged in the back room until he found
a shovel he took up a lantern and fol-
lowed them

  ella watson sat staring with unseeing
eyes at the bunk where the man had lain
she felt she was going to lose her reason
this  sudden blinding brain-searing
revelation of jim averells character tore

at her sanity she stood in the corner until
luke and his men came back until they
all left until she couldnt hear the sound
of their horses any more

  riding home in the dark jim averell
felt the condensed hostility of his men
he had earned their contempt and except
for the man luke their fear his sway
over them was seriously upset his rustling
game about finished

  he did not feel much regret he was
almost a cattle baron himself now-rich
in both land and beef he allowed him-
self a thin mirthless smile yes a very
rich man thanks to the skilful protection
of ella watson but he did not consider
that

there was a lean-to in back of the
cabin where ella kept her horse she
saddled the black mare in man-time held
the animal for a moment and then let it
have its morning run up the road toward
jims store

  a strange silence hung over the averell
buildings as she opened the door to the
saloon the charged tension of the room hit
her with the force of an electric shock
this was the breathless hushed moment
preceding a gun-fight-a moment when
mens hate seemed to draw all life out of
the air leaving a vacuum without mea-
sured time

  there were two or three loungers at the
poker table riveted to their seats and
another man at one end of the bar half-
bent and white-faced

  jim averell pale and with thin-drawn
lips stood behind the bar both his hands
were palm-flat on the walnut top her
glance flicked to him instantly then back
to the other central figure in that scene
the man luke stood in the center of the
square room crouching shoulders hunched
forward eyes pinned to averell without
looking at her he said to the woman stay
out o this ella

  she had never used her gun before
except to wound a man but she could not
bluff this out she managed to say quite
calmly

  hes my man luke if you get him
youll have to get me too she reached
for her gun

  surprise and annoyance showed on
lukes face he made a half-tum toward
cattle

ella remembered averell and realized his
error all in one moment and tried to swing
back

  but averells colt was booming the
muzzle just lifted over the top of the bar
making a little orange blossom there and
the heavy bullet caught luke in the chest
pushing him around so that he faced ella
watson

  hate and death-pain contorted the mans
features his own gun was out and he
tried grimly to steady it on the woman
ella watson eyes sprung wide shuddered
and fired

  she recoiled as the mans body crashed
at her feet pale and shaken visibly
shocked her life had not so coarsened ella
watson that she could look on death un-
moved

  averell came swiftly from behind the
bar soothing her with low and gentle
words signaling the men in the room to
get rid of the body

  he took her into the back room that
served as his office made her swallow a
double finger of whiskey color flooded
back into her cheeks but an unforgetful
look remained in her eyes what hap-
pened jim she asked quietly

  averells close brush with death had
unnerved him he knew that only ella
watsons arrival had saved him it was
always irritating to him when things
seemed out of his control he was very
terse

  luke figured to run the outfit he
picked a quarrel with me and went to shoot
it out

  the liquor had loosened ella watson
she sat staring moodily ahead some-
where along the line she had dropped most
of her finer instincts but she had never
killed a man the magic was out of this
game all the fun and secret laughter of
outwitting the cattle barons the thoughts
she kept locked in the back of her brain
came crowding forward she had loved
life too well this girl and tasted too
deeply of its many pleasures and disap-
pointments and had watched too many little
dreams die she was definitely afraid now
and fearful of the future the open
hostility of the country the revolt in their
own outfit both emphasized the treacherous
angles of jim averells schemes

  she looked up at him curious to see

kate	

what effect all this was having upon him
wondering why there had been no expres-
sion of gratitude from him and discovered
his eyes bent on her in a fierce cruel glare

  averell near to fathoming her thoughts
caught himself in time he smiled and
the ruthless look of his face vanished so
quickly she half thought she had imagined
it

  honey im sorry id probably be
dead now wasnt for you you dont
know what i went through facin luke
down knowin how handy he was with a
gun i thought-i thought id never see
you again

  these were the right words they
reached ella watson they drew her to
him she rose and put her hands lightly
on his chest did you jim did you
he bent and kissed her though he did
not love her he was surprised at the pas-
sion she always stirred in him the fact
remained she was a beautiful woman with
a certain richness that her hard life had
not dissolved it was he reflected a very
easy and pleasant part to play

  ella watson disengaged herself asking
a disconcerting question jim when are
we going to be married you have prom-
ised for so long

  averell met that question head-on
matching her own eagerness soon ella
soon im going to expand the business-
ride with the boys myself a few more
months of calf raiding and well be set for
life then we can go to cheyenne get
married and maybe go back east on our
wedding trip

  ella watsons face glowed her eyes
shone as she pictured the dream for a
little while all her doubts and fears were
dispelled

averell had plans for cattle kate
he wanted to devote his full time
to the sagebrush politics of the country
wanted to see what he could get out of
the feud between the big and little cattle-
men he needed a clear name to do this
and he was already under suspicion

  but ella watson was under deeper sus-
picion at his listening post in the valley
jim averell had heard the rumdrs the
many and sometimes incredible stories of
cattle kate watsons purported villainies
stories of her seduction of innocent cow-
	frontier stories

boys of how she forced them into her
rustler band he had done nothing at the
time but keep these stories from ella
watsons ears indeed he had nourished
them adding a few of his own realizing
vaguely that he was building something for
the future now he blessed that foresight

  he would make another-his last-calf
raid and this time leave a broad trail all
the way back to ella watsons corral
an easy trail that the cattlemen would
surely follow for it would be a specially
injurious raid cattle kate watson would
be exposed as queen of the outlaws he
chuckled briefly and the men riding with
him turned to look at him curiously he
was glad they could not see his face jim
averell was feeling very well pleased with
himself

  averell carried out the raid and it was
as he had planned a particularly reckless
and nose-thumbing one and it seriously
depleted a j bothwells spring crop of
calves

  stiff and weary and dusty averell stood
alone in his bar after the raid he poured
himself a drink grateful for the warmth
in this pre-dawn chill and reviewed a
good deal of his past he was struck by
the sudden urgency of ella watsons de-
mands upon him in a way it touched his
vanity last night when he had run the
bothwell calves into her corral she had
not even come out he lifted a silent
toast muttering so long ella after-
ward he stumbled into the back room
found his bed eased off his boots wanted
to get a couple of hours sleep before he
left for that stockman-granger meeting in
rawlins

  ella watson awoke on the morning of
july  bathed in a cold sweat there
had been a dream the night before in
which jim averell came toward her with
a rope she had felt a nameless dread
and turned to run but her way  had been
blocked on all sides by grinning herds of
young calves	

  she sat now on the edge of the bed
staring moodily ahead hair sleep-tumbled
about her face the sordid edges of her
life crept in on her and she was afraid

  heavy-hearted she dressed slowly try-
ing to think out her future wondering
what was going to become of her in this
country she reached for the small riding

boots she usually wore but they looked
uncomfortable today she put on a pair

of moccasins she had worked for jim
averell

  at this moment she heard the horses and
the spring wagon coming up the road and
remembered the calves jim averell had
put in her corral the night before

averell and his men had made the
mistake of taking calves that bothwell
had personally marked as the prize of the
crop he had stored their appearance in
his mind and knew them as well as a man
knows his own dogs from his neighbors

  seven men rode up to the watson cor-
ral these seven were the cattle kings
of the valley-bob connor john durbin
bothwell and four others they brought
a spring wagon with them

  bothwell circled the corral and sounded
an outraged bellow

  thems my calves john he shouted

  the wire around the enclosure was cut
and the herd driven out ella watson
blazing with anger ran out to face this
threat

  what the hell do you think youre do-
ing thats my beef and this is my land
get off it ive worked hard for it and
took it honest which is more than you sage-
brush pirates can say

  she had recognized her callers as the
big men of the valley and was a bristling
furious figure suddenly she remembered
she was unarmed and made for the cabin
and her six-guns on the dead run

  head er off yelled bothwell but
bob connor and ernest maclain guess-
ing her intention leaped from their saddles
and caught her before she reached the
door

  ellas struggles were brief for she pru-
dently realized the odds against her in
a somewhat petulant tone she demanded
where they were taking her

  ella said stern john durbin a re-
ligious and justice-loving man your game
with jim averell is done we know the
true purpose of this sinful establishment
you and jim must leave the country

  ella flung back her head in a scornful
laugh her eyes flashed you make me
sick you sanctimonious land crooks leave
the country when jim averell and the
little ranchers hear of this you fellows will
cattle kate	

be lucky to get out of the sweetwater with
whole hides why the pack of you aint
enough to take jim averell

  durbin shook his head

  at this moment there was a commotion
near the corral a young boy messenger
for ella and jim was trying to catch up
a horse and mount he was quickly cap-
tured and the party headed up the road
toward averells store and saloon it was
a hot afternoon that turned mens shirts
dark with sweat and a heavy golden haze
of dust traveled constantly with them

  averell was just starting for casper and
had dismounted to close the first gate and
open the second in his fenced pasture

  we have a warrant for your arrest
averell one of them exclaimed

  lets see it replied jim

  durbin and bothwell flashed their colts
quietly from durbin we reckon this
is warrant enough jim come along with
us

  averells jaunty composure did not de-
sert him he mounted to the spring wagon
and reassured ella also treating his cap-
tors to his opinion of what would happen
to them for this unlawful action neither
he nor ella nor for that matter any mem-
ber of the party clearly foresaw the
terrible end of this ride

on up the sweetwater road lumbered
the wagon with the riders jogging
beside it there was a lot of argument
and talk passing among the cattlemen
they were worrying things over in their
minds trying to decide what to do with
the rustlers and their indecision was a
source of humor to ella and jim

  finally john durbin said earnestly
you two have got to quit the country-
right now an you know damn well what
for if you dont leave he added trying
to make a serious threat well drown you
in this river

  jim averell spat with contempt

  if i leave the country ill damn well
be paid for it im a big man myself now
-own land and cattle plenty of both
but if your figure is right i might take
your offer

  ella watson was a little unnerved by
the business-like attitude of the vigilantes
she laughed hysterically

  drown us in that river why there
aint enough water there to give one of
you land hogs a decent bath

  she was right and her outburst plus
jims sarcasm was trying to the temper of
the sweetwater men

  a consultation took place between dur-
bin bothwell and connor

  all right said durbin if you wont
listen to us there is only one course we
can take

  the prisoners were hauled down from
the wagon and the party labored over high
masses of piled boulder and rock along the
stream bed they reached a cottonwood
and two ropes were produced and knotted

  averell let them place a noose around
his neck and took his stand on a lower
branch of the cottonwood he was still
cheerful and unmoved for he did not think
the cattlemen would carry through their
purpose

  but ella watson broke down completely
sobbing and fighting she wrestled vio-
lently with her captors and fought off the
noose with wild heavy lunges of her
body one moment she shrieked her full
vocabulary of epithets at the cattlemen
and the next begged them to spare her
for the sake of their mothers and sisters
her nerve her hard veneer and rough
courage were all gone now and the
beauty that had helped make her reputa-
tion on the frontier had no effect on these
grim ranchmen

  the valley cowmen were still hesitating
to push the rustlers out into space when
an interruption occurred a confederate
of jim and ellas frank buchanan
brought by the young messenger the cow-
men had captured and then let go when
they took averell opened up from across
the stream with a six-shooter bullets
whizzed about and john durbin fell with
a thigh wound others hauled out their
rifles to meet the unexpected attack

  buchanan was driven off without much
trouble but in the excitement someone
pushed jim and ella off their limb

  they did not die quickly or pleasantly
and it wasnt till thirty hours later that
residents of casper came and cut them
down the moccasins of wyomings lady
rustier had dropped off and lay under the
tree where they died
a novelet of a death-bound trail from taos

doom on the trail

by james p webb


the girl from louisiana had all the heroes of the frontier to choose
from but she picked as her guide into peril country the man who
had left her brother in the redskins path

mitch doom was tall spare and dirt his dark pockmarked face seemed
wide-shouldered he was hard as to have the same leathery quality as his
iron and as tireless as a wolf his hunting-shirt and his gray eyes hinted
buckskins were stained with smoke and smoulderingly of an untamed spirit


	frontier stories

  squatting against the back wall inside
the half-dark trappers cabin doom stared
at tim idleman

  ive been trappin and huntin in these
mountains for a long time tim doom
said in a harsh voice and i never saw it
fail the red devils  be cornin into
west park right away now lookin for
trappers that didnt have sense enough to
get out with their catch soon as the passes
open up

  tim idleman was nearly as tall as mitch
doom and he was dressed much the same
but his face was not as hard as dooms
nor his muscles as tough now his eyes
had a sultry gleam

  you been bossin me and bill all win-
ter idleman said and thats all right
youre supposed to be the leader we got
eight hundred good furs but theys plenty
more we aint got ive trapped some my-
self and i aint lookin for the utes to
bust in here for a month yet

  mitch dooms smouldering eyes did not
waver his bleak face did not change ex-
pression he said

  we got eight hundred furs thats a
good catch ive worked many a winter
for less i say nows the time to get out
the third member of their trapping
team young bill yelton leaned against the
wall across from doom this was only
his second winter as a trapper he said
mitch we got the furs all cached where
the utes couldnt find em if they did come
we could take a chance

  doom shifted his glance to yeltons
face he spat

  we could take a chance he snapped
itd be takin a chance too if we stay
here another week were like to lose our
furs and traps and our hair too weve
done stayed too long

  tim idleman shrugged all right
mitch lets get our furs loaded on the
hosses and head for taos then but well
be losin by doin it

  mitch doom rose in his belt he had a
heavy knife and two single-shot pistols
his rifle leaned against the wall at his side
and he picked the gun up now he said
you boys better be gettin things ready
well take in the rest of the traps tonight
and well get the furs out of the cache and
packed on the hosses well pull out in
the mornin he moved toward the door

walking with the mountain mans effort-
less stride im goin up the ridge and
take a look around

  neither of his pards answered and
doom went outside his slow glance
moved around studying the surroundings
of the cabin varying from the rocky
mountain trappers usual custom doom
and his two friends had built a shelter of
pine entirely above ground instead of a
dugout

  doom set off up the slope to the north-
ward his eyes restless and alert the rifle
slung in the crook of his right arm his
bleak dark pitted face wore an unusually
grim expression as he walked his glance
returned again and again to a creek off to
his left marked by its bordering willows
and quaking aspens but nothing held his
gaze long

  doom reached the top of the slope and
started along the ridge he had taken
thirty steps when he stopped suddenly his
glance went down the northward slope
which was shaded by a scattered growth
of pine

 for twenty seconds doom did not
move then he turned and plunged off the
crest of the ridge taking a diagonal course
toward the cabin he went down the slope
in long plunging leaps

the cabin door opened and bill yelton
stepped outside he saw doom and
halted abruptly for a moment the youth
stood with his body twisted one leg bent
his head lifted as if frozen in that posi-
tion then he turned his head and spoke
over a shoulder and tim idleman opened
the door

  doom raced on his rifle swinging in his
right hand he called out in a harsh long-
reaching voice

  utes cornin get your guns boys
well have to run for it

  tim idleman jerked his head out of
sight and bill yelton wheeled about and
plunged into the cabin doom did not
slacken speed and he did not look back

  tim idleman and bill yelton ran from
the cabin idlemans glance went up the
slope and he uttered a curse

  there the devils come boys idleman
said and turned southward away from the
cabin at a run

  bill yelton was right on idlemans heels
doom on

but now that his pards were outside and
running- mitch dooms moccasined feet
slowed down and at the corner of the
cabin he stopped and turned

  doom stared upward at the charging
indians one of them was well in advance
of the others

  doom lifted his long rifle and took
steady aim the gun cracked sharply and
the leading redskin went down in a long
tumbling fall doom turned and ran re-
loading his rifle on the run

  tim idleman and bill yelton slowed
down at the sound of dooms gun they
looked back holding a jog-trot till doom
overtook them

  i counted twenty-two of em doom
said his breathing fast but well controlled
there aint but twenty-one of the devils
now

  they ran on they made the top of a
hill two hundred yards from the cabin
the utes were running around the cabin
and one or two entered

  doom grinned theyll have some fun
with our traps and what supplies we had
left he said but maybe they wont
find the furs we got em pretty well
cached come on boys

  he turned and ran on the indians
were leaving the cabin renewing the
chase their first object being to run the
white men down then they could return
to the cabin

  mitch doom swung along in an easy
loping stride he could have outdistanced
either of his pards but he held his speed
down with theirs the indians reached
the top of the hill and started down their
war-whoop reaching ahead of them

  the white men made for another low
hill reached the top and then doom said
lets wait here and give em some
lead boys

  the others stopped without question
and waited quietly  while the indians
charged nearer only the youth bill
yelton showed any sign of nervousness

  mitch doom raised his gun pick
your man boys and dont miss

  yelton and idleman put their guns to
shoulder and doom coolly pointed out
to them the indian each should shoot at
at a word from doom the three rifles
cracked and three indians fell the
remaining redskins did not even pause

the trail	

  come on doom said and they turned
and ran reloading their guns as they went
doom was grinning but it was a hard
unpleasant grin that leaves just
eighteen boys in a couple days we ought
to have em thinned out so we can handle
em

  bill yeltons breath was coming fast
sweat glistened on his young face he
looked at the mountain man in amazement

  couple days he echoed we cant
keep this up a couple days

  dooms grin faded i could he said
they aint got anything but tomahawks
and knives and arrows they cant fight
till they get pretty close but they think
they can fag us out we got to keep
goin

  tim idleman grunted hell mitch
  whats the matter

  bill cant keep goin long idleman
said he aint been on the trail long
y know me i can keep this up all day
mebbe but-

  well have to make a stand often
then doom said if they catch us-
they made another stand and fired
another round this time they got only
two indians and then they reloaded on
the run again

  doom said if i hadnt missed that
shot thered be fifteen of em-just five
apiece

  bill yelton said in a panting voice
you didnt miss and you know it it
was my injun that didnt fall

  you shot too quick tim idleraan
said you want to take your time when
youre shootin injuns at that distance
son

at midafternoon they were still run-
ning still stopping at intervals to
make a stand and reloading on the run
doom estimated that they had covered
about twenty miles the indians had
gained only slightly and all their gain had
been made in the past two hours when
bill yeltons pace had begun to slacken

  the youths face was pale and strained
doom watched him sidelong as he kept
pace with the boy tim idleman was
slightly ahead

  doom said theres only eight of the
redskins now if we could hold out a
few hours longer    the tall mountain
	frontier

man showed no sign of fatigue after the
seven hours of flight you pretty tired
bill

  bill answered jerkily cant    cant
make it mitch you and tim go ahead
i-

  mitch doom growled deep in his throat
were stickin together he looked back
and muttered an oath the eight utes
were much closer than they had ever been
before the pace of the white men was
getting slower and slower lets give
em another round boys

  tim idleman heard dooms call per-
haps but he continued to run doom
lifted his voice tim hold on well
give em a round

  tim idleman stopped with evident re-
luctance his pointed face wore a scowl
and he was muttering as he brought up
his rifle side by side the three whites
took steady aim and fired the eight red-
skins faltered then six of them came on
again their hair-raising warwhoop reach-
ing ahead of them

  the trappers were on a hill top and
now they turned and started down the
far slope bill yelton fired

  missed again yelton mumbled at
dooms side thought i could shoot bet-
ter than that

  youre tired bill doom said grimly
but theres only six now he stared
at tim idlemans back and dooms eyes
smouldered idleman had raced out ahead
of his companions again whats your
hurry tim youre gettin ahead of
yourself

  idleman did not answer

  bill yelton gasped i cant run any
further mitch you and tim go on i
cant  

  we started out together doom
snapped me and tim both knew you
was a greenhorn son we stick together
but i cant go on and theyre gainin
on us yelton said no use   
either we all get away from the red
devils doom said sharply or we all
fight till theyre killed off

  itll be us thats killed off tim idle-
man said raspingly bills right mitch
no use for all of us to-

  doom stared at idlemans back hell
tim we been together all winter i never
knew you show the white feather

stories

  white feather hell idlemans voice
was high and angry its just sense
mitch aint no use in all of us gettin
scalped just cause one cant run no fur-
ther he swept his left hand forward
in a gesture down theres a gully where
bill can get cover and fight it out
doom said well fight it out there
then if bills played out all of us
they reached the bottom of the hill
and the washout which tim idleman had
mentioned lay just ahead the utes were
already at the top of the hill and their
cries became shriller and fiercer as the
redskins started down the slope

  tim idleman plunged into the dry wash
and scrambled out on the other side he
paused briefly his dark eyes flicking at
dooms lean pitted face and moving away
again he said quickly

  im goin on mitch you cornin with
me or stayin with bill

  dooms voice whipped sharply as he
jumped down into the gully get down
in here tim

  im goin tim idleman said doggedly
and he turned and ran his wiry legs mov-
ing fast

  mitch dooms dark face hardened he
swung his rifle to shoulder and he was
facing south not north toward the indians
his harsh voice raced out stop tim
but idleman did not stop and doom laid
his smouldering glance along the gun bar-
rel centering idlemans back in the sights

  bill yeltons voice brought doom
wheeling around the youth was lying
on the sloping side of the wash his rifle
leveled over the bank the six utes were
charging across the flat

  yelton fired and one of the indians
dropped doom lifted his rifle again mut-
tered i ought to a shot the- and
pulled trigger another indian went down

  theres only four now son doom
said calmly soons we finish em off
we head south and settle with that skunk
idleman im disappointed in tim he
was reloading swiftly as he talked and
bill yelton busy at the same task did
not seem to be listening

  doom dropped his rifle as the indians
plunged at the edge of the wash bill
yelton turned loose of his own gun and
sprang backward clawing at the knife in
his belt dooms right hand jerked out
doom on

one of his single-shot pistols and he fired
at an indian who was making a long leap
at him with a tomahawk

  the mountain man had to leap aside to
keep the dying redskin from falling against
him he dropped the empty pistol and
jerked out his knife he saw the youth
stab one of the indians who was upon
him but the blow did not strike a vital
spot and the two rolled over on the ground
together the indian trying to use his
tomahawk

  the other two indians leaped at doom
one had a knife the other a tomahawk
the tomahawk flashed down and doom
parried the blow he drove his knife into
the redskins breast heaved back to jerk
the weapon free and received a slash on
the arm from the knife of the other indian

  doom whipped his arm sidewise slash-
ing at his remaining opponent a fleeting
glimpse showed him bill yelton down on
his back with the indian on top of him
with a tomahawk doom whipped his arm
forward in a vicious stabbing blow at his
indian and felt the blade bite flesh the
redskin sagged and doom did not wait
to retrieve his knife

  jumping forward doom jerked his re-
maining pistol with his left hand shoved
the muzzle forward and fired but he
was too late and he cursed savagely even
as the pistol cracked

  the tomahawk struck yeltons head
and the youth went limp the redskin
crumpled on top of him shot in the
temple doom dropping the empty pistol
leaped forward and rolled the indian off
the body of his young pard then he
straightened slowly and stared with smoul-
dering eyes into the south blood streamed
down his right arm and dripped off his
hand but he did not seem to notice

                 ii

ix days later doom walked into brants
fort which was a trading post about
a hundred miles northward of taos
doom had traveled more than one hundred
and fifty miles in those six days despite
the fact that he had buried the body of
bill yelton near the spot where he fell
and after that had tried to pick up the
trail of tim idleman

  joe brant the trader saw the tall

the trail	

  lithe figure of the approaching mountain
man and met doom at the gates the
aging trader did not make the trapper
welcome there was a definite coldness in
brants stare

  so youre here he said gruffly i
figured youd be goin back after the furs
but i guess you need hosses

  doom stared whats the matter with
you joe

  nothin the matter with me brant
said only i wouldnt have expected it
of you mitch there aint much i can
say to a man who turns on his own pards
just so he can keep the whole catch for
himself

  dooms lean pitted face looked as hard
as bronze his lips made a thin slash
under his beak of a nose and his gray
eyes smouldered with the fires of sup-
pressed anger he said softly who
are you talkin about joe

  joe brant made a gesture with his right
hand he said gruffly tim idleman was
here he says you shot that young feller
that was with you and shot at tim but
he got away thats what he told us
mitch doom did not change expression
but the smouldering gleam in his eyes be-
came more sultry he voiced a soft oath
so tim told you that did he

  brant nodded said you was walkin
behind em twenty or thirty miles this
side o your trappin grounds he says
there was some injuns behind you quite
a distance and you figured youd tell
folks the injuns killed your pards only
tim got away

  dooms voice was still low and calm
so you dont want me here joe

  brant said if you did that mitch i
dont a white man-

  doom turned away take your tradin
post and go to hell he said harshly

at noon of the fourth day doom
entered taos his bleak pitted face
was grim and when he noticed certain
acquaintances avoiding him his eyes
smouldered he strode into a saloon
where about a dozen men were drinking
and talking near the far end of the
bar the mountain man spotted kit car-
son neat in black broadcloth

the talking ceased abruptly as doom
entered he paused stared from one un-


frontier stories

friendly face to another and then moved
forward his moccasined feet made no
sound he saw that carsons gaze was
steadily upon him and he strode down the
room and stopped in front of the old
trapper

  the old frontiersman was middle-sized
quiet-voiced and mild of manner he said
softly

  tim idlemans been talkin about you
mitch

  mitch said where is tim

  carson shrugged gathered up some
bosses and pulled out this morning what
happened mitch

  redskins jumped us doom said we
had to run for it young yelton fagged
out and couldnt go any further so we
made a last stand in a dry-wash tim
refused to stay with us i ought to ve
shot the skunk but the injuns were upon
us too soon if tim had stayed i reckon
they wouldnt have got bill

  carson nodded that isnt the story
tim told he says you shot yelton your-
self and tried to shoot tim too but he
got away

  dooms eyes smouldered he allows
we both got scalped i reckon ill bet
hes goin back to gather in the catch and
keep it all for himself

  carson nodded again he wanted to
explain how he managed to get away and
he hit on the idee of sayin you shot yelton
and turned on him ive known tim for
some time mitch trapped with im one
season

  doom went back to the front end of
the bar ignoring the hostile stares of the
other men he had just stepped up to the
bar when a huge mountain man entered

  the huge trapper looked around the
room then he moved forward paused
behind one of the drinkers and said
mister im cal brown im a-lookin
fer kit carson they told me id find
im in here pint him out to me will
ye

  the man at the bar half turned and
pointed at carson

  cal brown moved on his huge moc-
casins noiseless on the floor at first
brown moved rapidly his dark eyes cen-
tered on carson but as he drew nearer
his steps slowed down and perplexity
wrinkled his low brow he stopped ten

  feet from carson he scowled

  mister he rumbled i aint a-mindin
a leetle joke when they say yere kit
carson the man who done all that fightin

i	know theyre a-havin their fun thats
all right but im in a rush now if yell
jest pint out the shore-enough kit carson
ill let ye off without no busted bones
a twinkle appeared in carsons eyes
and a faint smile touched his lips he
stepped back away from the bar and his
glance ranged along the line of men he
lifted an arm and pointed straight at mitch
doom

  theres kit carson said

  a ripple of subdued mirth ran the length
of the room and was quickly choked off
as cal brown moved toward doom

  thats more like brown said heartily
friend kit i want to see ye private
mitch doom opened his lips to deny that
he was carson then without knowing
exactly why he changed his mind and said
nothing he followed the huge trapper
outside

  a woman sent me to fetch ye brown
said shes in a wagon out yonder
mitch doom stopped suddenly scowling
what woman 

  brown paused and turned i dunno
kit i allowed yed know who she is she
told me to send ye out to talk to her
doom studied the huge trappers face
and you dont know who she is

  shore i know in a way brown ad-
mitted i been guidin her train rest
o the wagons air gone on but shes
stayin here hired me but i dont know
yit what for her pas with her too
well doom said impatiently who
is she 

  her names irene yelton brown said
her an her old mans from louisiana

the conestoga wagon stood in
the shadow of an adobe wall irene
yelton appeared to be about twenty years
old she had thick red-brown hair and
level gray eyes she looked at mitch doom
with frank appraisal

  doom removed his hat cal brown
said you wanted to see me he said 

  the girl said yes ive heard of you
mr carson and i dont know anybody in
this country of course i want- she
stopped and bit her lip my brother
doom on

william ran away from home and came
west for a while we didnt know where
hed gone we got a letter written last
fall from taos and he said that he was
trapping he said that he was going out
to a place he called west park with two
men named doom and idleman

  doom nodded his face impassive he
knew about that

  father and i came out here hoping that
we could find him and take him back
home irene yelton went on she stopped
again and bit her lip a mist of tears
blurred her fine eyes but now-

  doom said softly youve heard that
hes dead 

  she nodded we heard we had
barely arrived here when mr idleman
came father found out who he was and
talked to him he told father about bill
   about how that man doom shot him
in the back

  dooms eyes smouldered and he said
nothing

  now we want to go to bills grave
irene yelton said her voice unsteady

  its a long trip doom said and
dangerous

  she lifted her eyes and looked at him
again despite her beauty the frank
steadiness of her gaze and the strength of
her chin gave her a strong resemblance to
her brother bill

  we know that but we wish to under-
take it anyway she said we want you
to guide us along with mr brown

  it wouldnt be safe for you doom
said gruffly

  her eyes flashed im willing to take
that risk it isnt only that we want to
visit my brothers grave i want that ruth-
less murderer brought to justice we want
to employ you mr carson

  for a long moment dooms smouldering
eyes held her gaze the lines of his pit-
ted face became harsh and bitter he
said

  its a fool trip you cant go in a
wagon wed have to ride horseback
youd have to have some other clothes
i can ride the girl said as for
the other clothes ill get some buckskin
garments can you find out where bills
grave is located

  mitch doom his smouldering gaze never
leaving her face nodded once

the trail	

  i can take you right to the place he
said if the injuns dont get you first
but youre a fool to make the trip

   bill and i were the only children she
said color climbed up into her soft
cheeks but her voice did not falter as
to whether im a fool or not you maj
have your opinion mr carson will you
guide us

  and again mitch doom nodded

ill

irene yelton and mitch dooitf
rode side by side behind them came
the girls father henry yelton he wa
a thin pale man distinctive and dignified
with gray mustache and imperial he
seemed out of place on the plains but
doom had noticed that yelton handled his
weapons as if he were used to them

  behind yelton was cal brown mounted
 a shaggy mustang the huge mountain
man was managing the two pack horses

  they had been on the trail three days
and they had passed within sight of brants
fort the preceding day at dusk

  doom glanced sidewise at the girl she
showed no indication of fatigue though
they had been making fifty miles and more
each day she wore a broad hat over her
rich red-brown hair and she had acquired
a fine buckskin riding outfit from a mexi-
can woman in taos

  the girl was gazing at the upthrust of
mountains to the northwest her eyes
had a pensive expression and her full
lips were slightly parted

  this is a lonely land she said 
almost seems that its too lonely to have
graves in it

  mitch doom said gruffly aint any
land that lonely and after that they
rode in silence for a few minutes

  then the girl said did you find oui
where    where bills grave is

  doom nodded if we keep on goin
we ought to be there the day after to-
morrow or maybe the day after that he
turned his head and looked at her 
still dont see why you wanted to make
this trip

  irene bit her lip then she said i
know it must seem foolish to you mr
carson but-well bill and i were very
fond of each other and it just seems that
	frontier

i must see where he lies i couldnt bear
never to see his resting place she
paused and added and somewhere out
here in the wilds is the fiend who shot
him

  mitch dooms eyes smouldered

  and if you find him he asked what
then 	v

  irene turned her head and looked full
at him if he is found you and mr
brown are to see that he pays a certain
fierceness shook her voice oh i could
shoot him myself

  mitch dooms grin was wolfish and the
edges of his lips were pulled back to expose
his jaw teeth he said what if he aint
guilty  how do you know bills even
dead

  why- her eyes opened wide do
you mean he may still be alive

  do you know he aint he countered
you heard anybody say what happened
except tim idleman	

  she shook her head no i-

  well doom said and his lean face
resumed its normal expression im sorry
to say your brothers dead but tim
idleman didnt see him die and he dont
know it tim just sort of guessed

  irene looked at him her gray eyes puz-
zled how do you know that mr
carson 

  i know doom said slowly your
brother was killed by injuns

 do you know mitch doom she
asked

doom nodded and tim too mitch
doom never shot a white man in his life
she rode with her head down thought-
fully for several minutes doom watched
her with a sidelong gaze

  now i dont know what to believe
she said weve heard so much of you
mr carson we learned to trust you
before we ever saw you if you say doom
didnt-

  dooms gaze was ranging ahead and
around he reined his horse to a halt and
put a hand to stop irenes mount henry
yelton halted and behind him big cal
brown brought his horses to a halt

  doom said wait here

  he rode ahead leaving the others
standing and rode up a slope to the crest
of a low hill shading his eyes with a

stories

hand he peered about presently he
turned in the saddle and motioned with
his right arm and the others rode up
to him

  what was it irene asked anxiously

  doom shook his head nothin were
in injun country though have to be
careful

  i aint seen a sign of any redskins
yit cal brown called out from the rear
dont believe theres ary red varmint in
a hundred mile

  henry yelton rode up alongside doom
he was erect on the saddle and his eyes
under heavy brows were keen

  i dont know anything about fighting
indians mr carson he said but im
not at all a poor shot in the event that
we are suddenly attacked by a superior
force id like to be able to make a good
showing

  doom said dryly if were jumped at
all itll be by a superior force all right
most important thing in fightin redskins
is to keep cool and make your shots count
reckless shootin will lose your hair best
thing is not to shoot till you see youre
goin to have to redskins are scared of
a loaded gun sometimes they try to make
you shoot before theyre in much danger
of gettin hit and then theyll close in
while youre reloadin

  doom glanced at the girl and added
theres a mighty strong chance we wont
see any injuns its a little too early in
the spring for many injuns to be here-
abouts thats why i agreed to fetch you
over here the redskins that killed bill
were a sort of advance party young
bucks takin an early start

  henry yelton dropped back leaving
doom and the girl in the lead she was
staring at doom

  how do you know that she asked

  just figured it he said shortly

  she was thoughtful for the remainder
of that days ride they went into camp
at sunset and doom insisted that there be
no fire

  if any of the red devils are lurkin
around he explained theyll be lookin
out for campfires we better stand guard
tonight too

  the three men took turns at standing
guard but nothing happened
doom oly

in the morning doom permitted a fire
and cal brown prepared breakfast

  friend kit he said im the best
cok in the mountains and the best shot
but two and the strangest man that ever
stood in moccasins

  doom looked at the big man dourly
whore the two that can beat you
shootin 

  cal brown crouched beside the fire
looked up and grinned from what ive
heard youre one of em kit and from
what i hear mitch doom is the best of all
they tell me doom can shoot the toenails
off a runnin injun

  i doubt it doom snapped he turned
on his heel and went out to see about the
horses

  the morning was still crisp when they
mounted to begin the fourth days ride

  doom did not allow much conversation
between himself and the girl he seemed
moody and grim and he made frequent
spurts ahead to scout the country they
were approaching he saw no fresh in-
dian sign but his vigilance never relaxed
at high noon he ordered a halt for dinner
and went on again they covered at least
sixty miles before darkness settled over
the plains again

  the three men took turns standing guard
again and again none of them saw any
sign of indians

 they were up at daybreak and cal
brown was busy with the breakfast at
sunrise they were in the saddle

  look here cal brown called before
they had ridden a mile

  doom halted and turned in the saddle
brown was pointing a thick finger at the
ground

  tracks i

 doom said not injuns though
thats the hosses of a white trapper goin
into the mountains to pack out his catch
come on

  the girl riding at dooms side looked
at him curiously its odd how much you
can read from tracks she said you are
as i thought youd be except- she hesi-
tated then went on - except in some
ways

  what ways 

  well your looks perhaps and-

  doom made no reply to this after a
moment he said were better than two

the trail	

hundred miles from taos now its nearly
seventy to where your brothers buried
we wont travel so hard today and well
get there tomorrow he paused then
added gruffly then were goin on an-
other thirty miles to pick up my winters
catch

  irene frowned but i thought you had
to have pack horses to carry the furs
how-

  i think another fellowll have em
loaded by the time we get there

  you mean she said your partner
  doom nodded my pardner

  after another silence irene said i
didnt finish what i started to say yester-
day mr carson i said wed heard of
you and knew that you could be trusted-
doom put out a hand in a gesture that
stopped her he said if youve heard
so much how come you didnt hear enough
to know that carsons just about quit the
trail how come you thought hed be
as young as i am

  she turned her head quickly and her
eyes were wide as she stared at him
what do you mean

  i mean doom said sourly that im
not kit carson cal brown took it for
granted that i was carson and brought
me to you after that-

  her gasp was audible and she leaned a
little away from him both hands clutch-
ing the pommel of her saddle she said
then who are you

  im mitch doom

  irene uttered a little muted cry and
swayed in the saddle doom urged his
horse close and put out a steadying hand
and felt her body shrink from his touch

  henry yelton spurred forward and cal
brown seeing that something had gone
amiss lashed the pack horses and drove
them forward until the entire little party
was in a tight group

  yelton said quickly whats the matter
irene 

  dooms eyes were smouldering i told
her im not kit carson

  henry yelton started not kit car-
son he turned on his saddle to stare
at cal brown you said he was kit
carson whats- 

  cal brown loosed a bellow that caused
his wiry mustang to snort and prance
against the reins


frontier stories

  jumpin catamounts he roared you
mean to say that little squirt in that saloon
had the gall to lie to me jest wait till
i git back to taos

  mitch dooms hard grin exposed his
jaw teeth he said take my advice and
leave that little squirt alone hes kit
carson

iv

henry yelton recovered from his
amazement his jaw set firmly and
his eyes blazed as he turned back to face
mitch doom the rifle whipped to yel-
tons shoulder

 mitch doom the murderer of my
son

  dooms dark grim pitted face did not
change expression except for the smoulder-
ing of his eyes the hard grin remained
on his lips and gave him a strangely harsh
and bitter appearance he said

  put that gun down

  yelton snapped i ought to shoot you
i didnt kill your son doom said
irene yelton stared at doom with wide
eyes her face was pale she spoke
quickly wait dad i dont know what
to believe we dont want to make a mis-
take

  cal browns voice rumbled id never
a believed mitch doom would shoot a
pard in the back i dont think theys any
reason why you have to believe tim
idleman

  yelton kept his gun leveled i dont
know any reason why we should believe
doom either one things certain we
cant afford to trust him now im not
going to shoot you doom but ill give you
three minutes to get started head south
and stay out of my sight from now on
dooms grin faded at last and the
smouldering light in his eyes brightened
he looked as wild and dangerous and un-
predictable as a battle-scarred wolf his
voice took on a raspy harshness which
matched his appearance

  cal youll find the grave on this side
of a dry-wash straight ahead its seventy
miles maybe you can find it

  without further speech he reined his
horse aside

  cal brown said youll need some grub
mitch

  ill get my grub doom said and
turned southward he rode without look-
ing back erect in the saddle the smoke-
darkened buckskins molding his muscular
frame

a mile to the south dooms horse
dropped swiftly into a shallow ravine
which slanted toward the northwest doom
turned and followed it he had started
with this expedition and it was not in the
nature of the man to desert it even under
threat the fact that he had been dis-
missed by henry yelton made little dif-
ference the yeltons were far from
civilization and there was increasing dan-
ger of their running into a small raiding
party of indians

  doom had considerable faith in the abil-
ity of cal brown to guide the yeltons and
to scent danger but he did not feel that
he had been relieved from his own respon-
sibility the yeltons were new to the
indian country and their avowal that they
did not want doom along made no differ-
ence in the attitude of the mountain man

  and mitchr doom had business of his
own in the west park and there was
little time to lose

  at intervals during the day doom
sighted the yeltons he noted that henry
yelton was handling the pack animals now
and cal brown was scouting ahead

  toward sunset doom put his horse to a
run and passed brown and the yeltons
he picketed his horse in a grassy swale
took his rifle from the saddle-sheath and
stole up the slope he watched cal brown
go into camp

  back at his own dry camp doom chewed
on some jerked meat he had carried in his
saddlebag after moonrise he mounted
again and rode on

  about three miles northward at the
mouth of a ravine which opened out into
a grassy basin doom drew rein and stared
at the glow of a campfire some distance
ahead the moonlight was so bright that
the mountain man could not approach the
camp without being seen but he guessed
that this was a party of indians the
fact that they had only one campfire indi-
cated that it was a small party

  retreating some distance doom pick-
eted his horse and risked taking a few
hours sleep he was a light sleeper and
doom on

when alone he did not fear a surprise
attack and it was not likely that the red-
skins would move from their camp before
dawn

well before daylight doom was at
the mouth of the ravine again and
he stayed there long enough to watch the
indian encampment come to life a
breakfast fire glowed in the fading dark-
ness

  by the time the indians were finished
with breakfast the mountain man was
able to count them in the gray light so
far as he could see there were only six
of them he decided that they might have
been members of the same raiding party
which had attacked himself and his two
pards several days before

  on the other hand the six redskins
might be merely a scouting party from a
really formidable band of warriors

  doom retreated cautiously to the place
where he had left his horse the indians
armed with bows and arrows and knives
and tomahawks were heading out of the
basin directly toward the mouth of the
ravine these men were mounted and
doom thought that the horses they rode
were six of the pack animals which doom
yelton and idleman had had in west park
if this were so these indians had passed
the cabin and raided the place but prob-
ably they had passed before the arrival of
tim idleman and the new pack train

  doom rode below the crest of a ridge
occasionally moving up to peer down at the
indians the redskins were moving south-
ward and they seemed in no hurry they
were following a route which might bring
them face to face with the yeltons and
cal brown at any moment

  the yeltons were just breaking camp
when the six indians came over the brow
of the hill to the northward and sighted
them instantly they raised a blood-
chilling warwhoop and charged urging the
bony pack animals they rode into a run

  doom saw cal brown swing from his
saddle draw the horses close together and
grasp the reins of all three mounts in one
big hand brown held his rifle in his right
hand

  henry yelton and his daughter evi-
dently obeying a sharp order from brown

a-frontier stories-fall

the trail	

dismounted quickly both yelton and
the girl leveled their rifles at the oncom-
ing redskins mitch doom wacching
anxiously frowned

  the six indians riding as fast as the
horses would run split into two groups
three went to the left and three to the
right and they passed the yeltons at long
range yelton and irene turned to keep
them covered with the rifles but they did
not fire

  mitch doom smiled the redskins were
trying to work a common indian trick of
drawing the fire of the whites too soon
after which they could race in at close
range while the guns were being reloaded
and finish their enemies off with arrows
and knives but brown was restraining
his companions and that was well

  the indians a hundred yards or more
beyond the yeltons stopped and turned
and rode back their warwhoops splitting
the air they charged straight at the
whites as if they meant to run them down
they drew their bowstrings threateningly
as if about to let the arrows fly again
henry yelton and irene pointed their guns

  as before the indians swerved aside
without slackening speed three rode to
the left and three to the right and they
surged past without drawing a shot from
the whites

  the redskins came together in a group
again and faced around toward the whites

  mitch doom urged his horse down the
slope he was eastward of the indians
and he came in from the side while they
were getting ready to charge again the
mountain man knew that when the game
of bluff was finished the whites might
succeed in killing three of the indians
if yelton and the girl could shoot straight
but that would still leave three redskins
and their arrows would take effect it
was time to finish the thing one way or
another

  mitch doom voiced a long-running yell
and his horse surged down the slope at
breakneck speed

the six indians were charging again
and this one-man flank attack discon-
certed them for a moment brown yelton
and irene fired a crashing volley of shots
and two of the redskins rolled from their
running mounts mitch doom without
	frontier

slackening speed raised his rifle and killed
another

  arrows zipped through the air as the
three remaining indians charged on one
of them riding loosely and facing side-
wise loosed a shaft at doom as the lean
mountain man plunged within easy range

  dooms two pistols were out he saw
a hard-driven arrow plunge into cal
browns chest and doom cursed savagely
as the big mountain man sagged and
dropped to his knees doom fired his
right-hand pistol dropped it and shifted
the remaining pistol to his right hand as
the fourth indian plunged off his horse

 an arrow grazed dooms buckskin
sleeve and the two redskins swung their
mounts to face him another bow was
drawn when dooms second pistol cracked
and sent the red bowman tumbling to the
ground

  henry yelton sprang at the remaining
indian with rifle clubbed just as the red-
skin flung his tomahawk at doom yel-
tons rifle swung around hard and the
stock swept the indian off the horse

  the flying tomahawk which seemed al-
most to have been thrown by a dead man
hit the side of dooms dodging head a
flatwise glancing blow and the mountain
man reeled in the saddle dropping his
empty pistol the lunging horse seemed
to rim from under him and he fell
sprawling

  instantly it seemed irene yelton was
kneeling beside him and the sound of her
sobs reached through the darkness of the
mountain mans semiconsciousness

  irene uttered a low cry when she saw
that he was alive

  i just know she said that you
wouldnt have shot bill that way

  doom sat up a little groggily and his
eyes shifted toward the huddled body of
cal brown doom heard henry yelton
say

  you didnt have to come to our aid
doom it seems to me that a man who
would betray his partners wouldnt have
come to help us i think irenes right

  dooms cheek was streaked with blood
but the smouldering gleam was back in his
eyes he got to his feet and stagger-
ing a little he walked over to look down
at the huge body of cal brown

  brown was dead

 stories

  nothin to do but bury him doom
said his voice hoarse he looked at henry
yelton youd make a right good injun
fighter yelton but you ought to learn
to use a knife in close quarters

  irene yelton staring wide-eyed at the
indian her father had killed with the rifle
stock shuddered violently

doom and yelton buried the body of
cal brown but they left the indians
where they had fallen irene yelton who
had recovered some of her composure
protested against this but doom only
looked at her with faintly smouldering
eyes and offered no explanation

  the party caught up their scattered
horses mounted and went on traveling as
they had traveled the preceding day except
that now mitch doom instead of cal
brown was the leader doom missed cal
and sometimes when he glanced back he
was almost surprised for an instant to see
henry yelton handling the pack horses
and the huge buckskin-clad mountain man
not there

  irene was not in the mood for talk to-
day she rode in silence just ahead of her
father and the pack animals mitch doom
also dour and silent scouted ahead keep-
ing a sharp eye peeled for indian sign
he still was not convinced that the party
of six redskins were not merely scouting
for a large band which had made its way
into the vicinity of west park at the very
onset of spring but he saw no indians
that morning

  shortly before noon mitch doom rode
to the top of a low hill and looked down
the slope toward the dry-wash where he
and bill yelton had stopped to fight the
indians the tall trapper held his horse
quiet until the yeltons had come up be-
side him

  doom lifted an arm pointing at a low
mound which was topped by heavy rocks
theres the grave down there about
twenty feet from the dry-wash

  his smouldering eyes were not looking
in the exact direction indicated by his
pointing arm instead his gaze was lifted
far beyond and to the left a cavalcade
of animals dwarfed by distance were just
now topping the rise beyond the gully
doom knew that it was a string of pack
horses-loaded with eight hundred prime
doom on

beaver pelts-and that tim idleman would
be with the pack train

  a rider in a big hat was leading the
train and doom who had made a few
inquiries in taos knew that this would be
juan a young mexican whom idleman had
employed to assist him

  doom said you folks ride on down
there ill be along pretty soon he
dropped back a few paces and waited

  the yeltons rode down the slope doom
peered over the hill top and saw the pack
train coming along steadily he waited
a little longer his beak-nosed pitted face
and smouldering eyes as grim and savage
as the wilderness he inhabited

irene yelton was kneeling on the
ground beside the mound of earth and
stones which protected her brothers body
from the coyotes henry yelton erect
in the saddle stared into the distance

  the mexican found a shallow place in
the banks of the dry-wash and led his
train across behind the last animal rode
tim idleman his pointed face and sullen
eyes showing curiosity as he watched the
man and the girl beside the new grave
he gestured with an arm to the mexican
and juan brought the pack train to a halt
juan tilted his hat against the noon sun
and hipped over in the saddle to rest his
muscles while he prepared and lighted a
quirly

  tim idleman rode over to the grave of
bill yelton he looked down at the kneel-
ing girl and remained silent until she saw
him and stood up henry yelton still
stared into the distance sitting as erect as
a cavalryman

  the girl stared at idleman with distaste
she said did you think the indians killed
mr doom

  tim idlemans eyes narrowed he said
uneasily i thought likely but when i
came along here night afore last i didnt
see nothin of his remains-nor more n
one grave

  the girls voice was strong with sud-
den conviction mr doom escaped
he and bill killed all the indians and
mr doom buried    my brother he
says if you had stayed with them my
brother probably wouldnt have been
killed

  tim idlemans face darkened and he

the trail	

muttered an oath whatre you talkin
about you tryin to make out i run off
from  

  the trappers glance shifted and ran
along the southward hill and his voice
died

  mitch doom was riding down the hill
the mountain man with the pitted face
was not urging his horse the animal
came on at a moderate gait and doom
held his rifle across the pommel of his
saddle

  idlemans mouth sagged open and his
pointed face was suddenly pale he reined
his horse around in a tight turn and went
past the lounging mexican at a gallop his
lean body bent low in the saddle

  mitch doom did not increase the speed
of his horse he balanced the rifle across
the saddle in front of him and cupped
both hands around his mouth his voice
reached out harsh and grim and far-
running 

  tim wait i want to see you

  idleman already far out along the rim
of the dry-wash swung his horse gradu-
ally southward he did not answer nor
heed dooms shout

  doom yelled might as well wait now
tim im cornin after you

  doom guided his horse toward the
mexican who was still lounging in the
saddle and smoking his quirly imper-
turbably while his dark eyes watched the
fast-fading form of tim idleman

  juan doom said these are my furs
-mine and yeltons yonder-and we want
you to take the train on to taos for us

  juan turned his head to look at doom
and there was a glint in the mexicans
dark eyes he said softly

  senor tim theenk you dead sefior
mitch i theenk you scare heem

on the return trip juan rode ahead
of the pack train to which had been
added the two horses belonging to henry
yelton yelton volunteered to follow be-
hind the train doom and the girl rode
side by side and the mountain man kept
a sharp watch for redskins until they had
reached a point a few miles north of
brants fort after which his vigilance re-
laxed somewhat

  they were following a course which
would take them past brants fort at a


frontier stories

distance of about a mile doom did not
show any inclination to pause there but
before they had ridden past the fort juan
saw a rider galloping out of the open gate
the mexican notified doom and the entire
party stopped and waited

  the rider was old joe brant himself
he was bareheaded and his whitening hair
whipped in the wind as he came on the
trader reined up a few feet from doom
and irene

  howdy mitch the trader said cor-
dially want to sell them furs
dooms eyes smouldered not to you
he said

  joe brant said cheerfully you neednt
blame me mitch i just knew what i
was told tim idleman passed here last
night and he stopped long enough to say
he was mistaken about what happened to
young yelton tim says now that the red
devils got yelton and that you werent
noways to blame for it

  doom said wheres tim now

  brant glanced southward i reckon
he was headin for taos mitch he claims
hes sold his part of the catch to you id
like to buy em

  ive got a sale for em in taos doom
said and when a man thinks id shoot
a pard in the back  

  brant did not argue the matter fur-
ther as soon as the pack train was on
the move again irene said youre vin-
dictive im afraid

  doom looked at her with smouldering
eyes and the nostrils of his beaklike nose
flared a little i dont know what that
word means he said not for sure but
when a man whos known me as long as
joe brant has   

 but why hold a grudge the girl
was watching him anxiously anybody
can make a mistake

  doom said harshly i aint holdin any-
thing against you and your father you
didnt know me anyhow youll be goin
back to louisiana right away but i got
to learn joe brant a little lesson hes
goin to stay in this country

  irene yelton smiled faintly and gave
him a sidelong glance are you glad
that ill be going back to louisiana
yes doom snapped

  the girl bit her red lower lip and stared
straight ahead

the third day after leaving brants
fort the pack train entered taos at
sunset doom called out to the mexican
take em to tom fanton juan hell
know

  juan nodded and went on with the pack
train doom and the yeltons sat their sad-
dles a moment in silence then henry
yelton said

  this is a big country mr doom im
glad we were able to see my sons grave
and    he held out his right hand

  doom shook hands then offered his hand
to the girl ill have to be goin now
he said ive got somethin to do

the girl stared at him what
im lookin for tim idleman doom
said in a harsh voice no pard of mine
can leave me in a tight and then try
to   

  irene said quickly youre not going to
kill him

  doom was breathing hard his nostrils
flared he looked at the girl with smoul-
dering fires in his gray eyes

  there aint room for both of us in
this country he said and his voice was
almost a snarl good-bye

  henry yelton looked keenly at his
daughter he said a man must live by
the rules i suppose come on irene
after a nights rest well be starting back
to louisiana in the morning thank you
mr doom im sorry about mr brown
and i hope you will forgive us some time
at least for doubting your integrity
but you havent paid him father
irene said keeping her gaze away from
the tall mountain man

  i wasnt workin for you doom said
harshly i was goin after my furs half
of the furs are yours he looked di-
rectly at henry yelton in the fading light
ill meet you at tom fantons early in
the mornin and settle up were sellin
the catch to tom

  doom waited where he was until yelton
and irene were gone then he rode to
the saloon in which he had met cal brown
looking in he saw that tim idleman was
not there

  doom stepped inside and the four men
at the bar looked at him and ceased talk-
ing dooms eyes were smouldering

he asked softly seen tim idleman
there was a long-drawn silence then
doom on

one of the men said he was here
mitch seemed in a rush kind of told
us he had made a mistake about what hap-
pened to bill yelton out yonder he
allows now the redskins got him

 doom nodded and went outside his
rifle was in the sheath on his saddle he
paused in the deepening gloom drew one
of his single-shot pistols and examined it
pushing the weapon back into the holster
he stepped outside-and almost bumped
into kit carson

  howdy mitch the old frontiersman
greeted when is the weddin

  what weddin

  carson chuckled yours mitch the
yelton girl

  mitch doom growled in his throat a
rocky mountain grizzly couldnt live with
me kit seen tim idleman today 

  carson peered intently at dooms face
a minute ago in manuels cantina

manuels cantina was on the oppo-
site side of the street and without
another word doom crossed over it was
a small place patronized mainly by the
mexicans who still comprised the major
portion of the pueblos population there
was a short counter in the barroom with
bottles of tequila and other fiery liquors
ranked on the back bar there were three
tables with chairs except for tim idle-
man and manuel himself the place was
empty

  idleman was in the act of lifting a glass
to his lips when he saw doom in the en-
trance turning quickly idleman dropped
the glass which shattered on the bar he
stared at doom his lean body in a recoil-
ing but motionless position his left hand
braced on the counter

  mitch he said hoarsely i told em
how it happened-and you can have the
furs

  with both his single-shot pistols still
holstered doom moved slowly forward
his dark face was grim and harsh and his
steady eyes blazed but he said no word

  idleman put out a hand as if to push
something away from him the hand was
shaking wait mitch i fixed it up
mitch doom moved on

  idleman still backing slowly along the
bar put his hands behind his back and

the trail	

unfastened the belt which circled the waist
of his hunting shirt the belt holding his
knife-sheath and pistol fell to the floor

  idleman said as if to reassure himself
you wouldnt shoot a man that cant shoot
back

  dooms lips drew back exposing his jaw
teeth he drew both his pistols and the
heavy knife and laid the weapons on the
bar and moved on without pause

  idleman circled

  manuel leaned across the bar and picked
up dooms two pistols and the knife the
mexican seemed to sense idlemans pur-
pose

  idleman his sharp pinched face con-
torted with a strange mingling of rage
fear and triumph made a sudden backward
lunge and clawed for dooms weapons
which were no longer on the counter
doom lunged with all the ferocity of a
mad wolf

idleman finding out too late that his
treachery had failed tried to dodge
away dooms fist nailed him on the jaw
and flung him against the counter before
idleman could recover doom planted two
more solid blows which seemed to keep the
traitorous mountain man pinned to the
bar idleman sagged and his eyes glazed
a thin stream of blood ran from a corner
of his mouth

  dooms left hand grasped the front of
idlemans shirt and jerked him forward
the dark-faced trappers strong right hand
fastened on idlemans throat and squeezed
with the slow inexorable pressure of a
closing vise idlemans face became suf-
fused with blood and his tongue pro-
truded from his open mouth his eyes
seemed ready to burst from their sockets

  a hand fell upon dooms shoulder and
kit carson said sharply youve never
killed a white man mitch

  slowly dooms fingers loosened their
grip he watched the purple hue fade
from idlemans cheeks and suddenly
doom jerked hard with his left hand and
flung his enemy sprawling to the floor

  idleman watching his former partner
fearfully scrambled shakily to his feet
he sidled toward the door and by the
time he reached it he was running

  beside doom kit carson chuckled

history feature

said thunder-rolling-over-the-moun
tain the great spirit puts it into the
heart and head of man to know how to
defend himself here is the unfor-
gettable story of joseph and his tribe

the united states army and the nez
perces had met early and in friend-
ship the pierced noses as french
traders dubbed them had hospitably re-
ceived the army explorers captain meri-
wether lewis and lieutenant william
clark and later major john c fremont
these tribesmen proudly declared that they
had never killed a white man nor broken a
promise a record which could by no means
be claimed by the whites

  from time to time the nez perces had
peacefully ceded portions of their broad
lands in idaho oregon and washington
their title in the remainder had been con-
firmed by treaty then the government
prompted by gold-hunters and settlers
abrogated that pact and offered a new one
demanding more territory it was signed
by all but the southern nez perces who
refused to be ousted from their home in
the wallowa valley in the northeastern
corner of oregon the last charge of their
old chief to his son had been a few years
more and white men will be all around you
they have their eyes on this land my son
never forget my dying words this coun-
try holds your fathers body never sell
the bones of your father and your mother
succeeding to the chieftainship thun-
der-rolling-over-the-mountain known as
joseph by the whites vainly exerted every
peaceful means to maintain his peoples
rights because he foresaw the inevitable
result of resistance he was about to yield



reluctantly and go on a reservation when
his hand was forced young braves who
had had a father or brother killed by set-
tlers went whooping on a raid and massa-
cred a score or more white men women
and children when they rode back to
camp waving reeking scalps joseph knew
that the die was cast grimly he promised
his tribe that he would give them a bellyful
of fighting

   still nobody thought that the nez perces
actually would take the warpath they
had dwelled long in peace and waxed pros-
perous yet these red men had not growii
soft not only did they possess the fin
physiques bravery and horsemanship so

  by fairfax downoy
common in their race but they would prove
capable of fighting as disciplined troops
the army would discover to its dismay
that joseph had even taught his warriors
infantry and cavalry maneuvers the nez
perces were well-armed and unlike most
indians excellent shots and as neither
they nor any one else could yet suspect they
were blessed with a magnificent leader

  joseph now about thirty-seven had
never been in a battle he was tall and of
commanding presence the mouth and chin
of his strong face resembled napoleons
so did his military genius this red gen-
eral in less than eleven weeks would con-
duct a valiant retreat of his tribe for more
than sixteen hundred miles engaging ten

separate commands of the united states
army in thirteen battles and skirmishes and
fighting them to a standstill

  this epic rearguard action has been justly
compared to the march of xenophon and
his ten thousand greeks it has been aptly
entitled u s vs joseph

four officers with ninety troopers of
the first cavalry shortly joined by
eleven citizen volunteers were dispatched
from fort lapwai idaho to punish the
raiders and round up the tribe they
marched seventy miles in two days and on
the night of june   camped near
white bird canyon before dawn they
mounted up and rode down into the gorge


	frontier

in the distance sounded what seemed to be
the eerie wail of a coyote in realty one of
josephs scouts signalling that the death-
trap could now be sprung

  joseph had sent his women and children
and his herds of ponies sheep and goats
down the salmon river into hiding behind
bluffs one hundred warriors he had placed
in ambush on the right side of the canyon
one hundred on the left

  behind an advance guard under lieuten-
ant edward r theller twenty-first in-
fantry followed captain joel g trimble
and his troop then captain david perry
commanding and lieutenant william r
parnell with the rest of the column they
trotted on through the broadening canyon
suddenly spurted flashes of flame and that
gloomy place reverberated to the shots of
charging nez perce horsemen theller
deployed and held them in check while
perry came galloping up

  but joseph extending his lines sent war-
riors flooding in on the flanks and turned
the left by sweeping the volunteers from a
butte sergeant michael mccarthy hold-
ing the right was isolated with six troopers
trimble rallied charged and brought them
off a little way but soon the whole blue
line went reeling back and again mccarthy
and his men were cut off

  this time parnell and a platoon smashed
through to the isolated group and gave them
a chance to mount up but as they galloped
off nez perce bullets swept two of the
rescued troopers lifeless out of their sad-
dles mccarthy had one horse shot under
him then a second too far behind to
catch a third he crawled into the under-
brush and hid beside the body of a dead
comrade from his concealment he saw
several squaws suddenly appear on a search
for plunder his boots protruded from
the thicket in plain sight and he dared not
move stealthily he wiggled his legs out of
the boots and pulled them back under cover
the squaws picked up the boots and went
on

  meanwhile the retreat of perrys shat-
tered column had degenerated into a rout
lieutenant theller and eighteen troopers
were driven into a cul-de-sac and died to a
man under the nez perce guns clear of
the canyon survivors of the command
whose casualties were forty per cent man-
aged to stand off pursuit the triumphant

 stories

joseph rode back to camp to learn that dur-
ing the battle his wife had borne him a son

  meanwhile the department commander
general o o howard had been concen-
trating troops against a possible contin-
gency howard who had lost his right arm
at the battle of fair oaks in the civil
war had not been altogether successful as
a commander in that conflict nor in subse-
quent administrative positions but now
his forethought and the promptness with
which he took the field spoke well for him

  howards force consisting of parts of
the twenty-first infantry first cavalry
and fourth artillery with a howitzer and
two gatlings-two hundred and twenty-
seven men-marched to the salmon river
to find joseph in a splendid position in the
mountains on the other side to get at him
howard had to cross leaving the river at
his back and his line of communications ex-
posed not only to attack by joseph crossing
at some other point but also to an onset by
a roving band of nez perces under the sub-
chief looking glass howard his admira-
tion for the red generals strategy mingled
with apprehensions left captain stephen
g whipple with two troops of cavalry and
a gatling gun to watch looking glass and
moved the rest of his command across the
river through pouring rain they toiled
up slopes so slippery that several pack mules
lost their footing and rolled down the moun-
tain gathering terrific momentum to de-
struction at the bottom when the column
reached the summit joseph was gone

  meanwhile whipple had found and
struck looking glass capturing six hun-
dred ponies but proving unable to prevent
the indians escape shortly he was him-
self desperately besieged at cottonwood
ranch by joseph who as feared had
crossed the salmon and wiped out a scout-
ing party of a lieutenant a sergeant and
nine troopers none too soon howard
got back over the river and relieved his
beleaguered subordinate

  it began to dawn on the army that it was
up against something unusual in indian
generalship troops had been singing a
refrain based on the spiritual turn back
pharaohs army now apparently general
howard was being cast in the role of
pharaoh and the nez perces as the chil-
dren of israel they their flocks and their
herds were led by their red moses over
rearguard action	

rivers without supernatural division of the
waters howard pursuing found joseph
united with looking glass and now two
hundred and fifty warriors strong en-
trenched by the south fork of the clear-
water river

  on july   battle was joined a
fierce conflict more than once hand-to-hand
the nez perces shot like expert riflemen
many soldiers were hit until they dug in
with their trowel bayonets then they were
pinned down behind their breastworks by
the indian fire an instants exposure
could be fatal a soldier who lifted his
head took a bullet through the brain an-
other tilting back his canteen to drink its
last drops of water-the indians held the
only spring-felt whistling lead cut off the
canteens neck at his lips one officer who
held up his hand was shot through the
wrist and another who jumped to his feet
for a second dropped with a neat hole
drilled through his chest

  joseph seemed to be everywhere his
shouts of command could be heard now in
one part of the line now in another sev-
eral times horses were shot under him but
he was untouched one of the charges
he launched outflanked his adversaries and
almost took the pack train which was saved
only by arrival of reinforcements another
galloping onslaught was a veritable red
charge of the light brigade except that it
was eminently successful joseph not only
drove through to his enemys artillery but
captured it and rolled the guns back toward
his own lines they stood abandoned and
useless in no mans land

  that night war drums boomed in tri-
umph in the indian camp and the scalp
chants terrifying hum-hum-hunt rose in its
crescendo to wild whooping climax at
daybreak the fusillade resumed and the
indians crept closer but now occurred a
supremely gallant episode which would
prove the turning point of the battle lieu-
tenant c f humphrey fourth artillery
led eleven men in a dash into the enemys
lines to recapture the artillery three
soldiers were killed two seriously wounded
and the lieutenant and one other slightly
wounded but back raced the heroic party
bringing off the guns and the dead and
disabled

  howitzer shells and a stream of lead
from the gatlings forced the nez perces

back into their trenches cavalry com-
manded by captain marcus p miller
charged the indians left they turned it
and rode cheering in on the rear under
such a blow many a foe would have broken
in wild panic not so joseph he counter-
charged and checked the blue horse while
his riflemen held off howard until he could
retreat across the river to a formidable
new position there he again entrenched

  the indian loss was heavier than that of
the army but the battle of the clearwater
had been a near thing joseph had been
forced to withdraw but had done so in good
order his line of retreat to the safety of
british columbia was still open

eneral howard sent back his
wounded and pushed doggedly on
joseph delayed him first by a parley which
came to nothing then by skirmishing he
then resumed his retreat through the fertile
kamai valley where the peaceful northern
nez perces were settled they neither
joined nor attempted to hinder him though
a few later served the pursuers as scouts
joseph now urged his faithful band on to
the lolo trail through the bitter root
mountains blocked often by huge bould-
ers and fallen trees and cut by deep ravines
it was as general sherman once declared
one of the worst trails for man or beast on
this continent over it hastened the war-
riors women and children the aged the
driven herds many a pony was ridden to
death but there was no dearth of remounts
and the fugitives drew away from the
troops keeping from two to three days
ahead

  fast as the nez perces travelled there
was something far swifter the invention of
a portrait painter named morse-the tele-
graph over the wires now become a
potent factor in this campaign clicked or-
ders for the interception of the hostiles as
they approached the other end of the pass
captain c c rawn with fifty regulars
and a hundred citizen volunteers was wait-
ing behind fortifications when joseph be-
gan to descend toward the valley

  joseph demanded free passage promis-
ing to harm no one as he went rawn of
course refused while a fierce fire was
opened on the fort the bulk of the nez
perces slipped around it through unknown
trails and streamed on through the valley
	frontier

settlers finding they were not to be raided
not only refrained from giving the soldiers
any aid but profited handsomely by selling
the indians supplies including rifles and
ammunition only one storekeeper re-
fused he banged the door in red faces
and whether through admiration for his
courage and decency or because joseph had
spoken against molestation the hostiles left
him unscathed

  on they pressed through the rockies and
camped in the big hole basin of montana
the weary tribe rested believing them-
selves safe for a few days since howard
was far behind but the whispering wires
had been busy again on telegraphic or-
ders colonel john gibbon came fast from
helena montana with six companies of
his seventh infantry in wagons a howitzer
and volunteers-about two hundred men
on august   his scouts sighted the
indian camp the unsuspecting joseph
had posted no sentries an attack at dawn
the next morning caught him completely
by surprise

  gibbon who moved his men up close
with the stealth of an indian stalker as-
saulted the village on three sides women
screamed in the bullet-riddled tepees
naked warriors burst out rifles in hand
soldiers fired at such close range that blaz-
ing muzzles powder-burned red chests
wreathed in the blue smoke of battle mad-
dened men cursed and clubbed guns batter-
ing skulls a fighting irishman william
logan who had enlisted as a private in the
civil war and now was a captain stood
face to face with an indian chief the two
of them blazing away with their revolvers
as the chief fell his sister wrenched the
smoking weapon from his hand and shot
the officer through the head

  the village was gibbons in twenty min-
utes under so disastrous a blow other
tribesmen might have fled the nez
perces were sterner stuff joseph rallied
them in the thickets by the river his
sharpshooters watched for insignia of rank
and picked off officers and non-coms out-
lined against the burning lodges charge
after charge was hurled against the blue
battalions red men and white fired point-
blank into each others bodies

  it was no question of victory now but
of life and death gibbon his losses heavy
sent a galloper up the valley to bring on

stories

howard and retired from the village to a
knoll there two lines back-to-back dug
in and held off the foe with a steady accu-
rate fire all day the battle raged and not
until late that night did the firing die down

  during that afternoon the wagon train
and a piece of artillery had moved up to
within five miles of the scene of combat
formed park and fortified at daylight
three non-commissioned officers and three
men limbered up the howitzer and led by
a scout started to join gibbon as they
were going into position on a bluff half a
mile from the village the alert joseph
spotted them thirty nez perce horsemen
bent low over their ponies necks raced
toward the gun before the terrifying
spectacle of an indian charge the nerve of
two of the cannoneers broke and they ran

  the rest of the gun crew stood by their
piece in the best tradition of the artillery
they got off two rounds before the red
riders closed in on them firing capture
certain now the crew put the howitzer
temporarily out of action by throwing the
barrel off its trunnions as they retreated
corporal sayles was killed and sergeants
daily and fredericks wounded

  the warriors who had captured the how-
itzer further disabled it by taking off the
wheels and hiding them had joseph been
able to teach his tribesmen to man a gun as
well as he had trained them in infantry and
cavalry tactics the battle of the big hole
might have ended then and there a storm
of shells bursting unexpectedly in the
trenches on the knoll must have cleared
the way for another furious nez perce
charge which even the valiant defenders
could hardly have withstood but artillery
is a technical arm which requires special
training the howitzers captors could do
no more than disable it a severe enough
blow to the blue and the redskins exploit
netted them a welcome bonus two thou-
sand rounds of rifle ammunition on pack
mules which had accompanied the gun team

  after the loss of the artillery gibbons
situation on the knoll grew more critical
food gave out and the command was re-
duced to cutting chunks from a dead horse
and eating them raw since they dared not
light a fire that ration had to serve until
a splendid dash led by sergeant mildon k
wilson brought through the wagon train
all day long the deadly fire of the nez
rearguard action	

perce snipers never ceased every rifle in
the blue line was needed to reply to them
and then there were not enongh all the
officers from the commander down picked
up guns of dead or wounded men and
joined the firing line finally a red sharp-
shooter got his sights on colonel gibbon
and squeezed his trigger the bearded civil
war veteran hit in the thigh had himself
propped up against a tree and continued
coolly to direct the defense

  pick off the enemys officers silence his
artillery josephs superb savage general-
ship employed the best tactics of civilized
warfare and now he even staged the 
equivalent of a gas attack with the wind
blowing strongly toward the knoll he or-
dered his warriors to fire the dry prairie
grass clouds of smoke blinding and suffo-
cating rolled on to the troops in the
trenches for a few desperate minutes
with the nez perces mustering for a crush-
ing overwhelming charge the battle of the
big hole was close to becoming a second
little big horn and the wounded gibbon
another custer

  however it is called-good luck or an act
of god-the only thing which probably
could have saved the gasping men in the
blue there on the knoll happened when
the blazing fire was only a few yards from
the entrenchments the wind veered shift-
ing dead about it blew the flames back on
their own smouldering embers where they
died out a hoarse cheer rang out as half-
choked doughboys and troopers stood to
arms again

  on the third day general howard came
galloping up at the head of two troops of
cavalry josephs scouts had told him of
the coming relief and under cover of night
he and his tribe load vanished his casual-
ties were eighty-nine dead including some
women and children to the armys twenty-
nine killed and forty wounded but he had
only narrowly missed victory and he was in
the clear once more with a commanding
lead

it was evident that more troops would be
needed if so formidable and elusive an
adversary was to be rounded up but no
more were immediately available at this
time serious labor riots were occurring in
the east and frontier posts had been
drained of regulars to support the militia

  since gibbon and his command were
hors de combat howard took the pursuit
the one-armed general figuring that
joseph would march southeast through the
rockies toward yellowstone national park
sent a detachment under lieutenant george
r bacon to bar the indians way in
tachers pass

  bacon rode fast on direct lines occupied
the pass and held it for two days with
never a sign of the nez perces then he
started back to report to his commanding
officer in the meantime joseph had ex-
ecuted a master stroke of strategy when
his scouts informed him of the departure
of bacons detachment and of the fact that
howard was standing fast the chief halted
his retreat he mounted up forty-five of
his braves formed fours and in the dead of
night rode straight into howards lines a
sentry seeing a cavalry column looming up
in the dark mistook it for bacon and his
men returning the riders were past him
before he belatedly challenged and gave
the alarm whooping and shooting joseph
and his warriors swooped down on the
camp they drove off all the pack mules
troop horses were saved for the most part
by their secure picketing but the indians
cut hobbles and stampeded some of them

  amid the confusion three troops were
pulled together and galloped furiously in
pursuit of the raiders joseph was waiting
for them he hit them head-on and on
both flanks two troops reeled back and
the third was cut off and surrounded in a
lava bed where it dismounted and fought
for life a lieutenant was struck by a
bullet which entered one hip pocket and
went out the other having pierced both
buttocks indian snipers crawled close
enough to shoot one soldier in the back at
fifteen feet other defenders dropped
badly wounded but the position was strong
and they held it when howard came up
joseph was gone-off through the now-
open pass pursuit was stalled by the
necessity of sending back for more pack
mules

  through the august glory of the yel-
lowstone rode joseph and his nez perces
that region had been made a national park
five years previously though it was still
little known two parties of tourists van-
guard of the millions who now -visit it
annually were enjoying camping trips
	frontier

there they were well equipped and armed
against possible encounters with bears tame
descendants of which roam the park today
they were not however prepared for
indians on the warpath

  the party from radersburg montana
consisting of six men and two women was
suddenly jumped in its peaceful camp
josephs strict orders that the women be
not harmed were obeyed but one of the
men was killed and a second shot and left
for dead

  two of the ten men in the other party
which was from helena montana were
killed one of the survivors was the camp-
ers negro cook who soon after he had
dodged the indians had just as narrow an
escape from a large and angry bear

  joseph pushed on but the telegraph was
clicking frantically again troops began
closing in from various quarters the
fifth cavalry rode down from the little
big horn country six troops of the
seventh under colonel samuel d sturgis
advanced to block the red anabasis the
indomitable howard still hung stubbornly
on the trail and now when joseph was
hardest pressed his scouts for once failed
him they reported that a strong force of
troops lay in his path across the shortest
and best route to canada as a matter of
fact the force was only a small detachment
of cavalry under lieutenant hugh l scott
this fatal misinformation diverted joseph
into a long difficult detour

  we knew declared the chief that the
distance was great but it is easier to travel
and fight than to die due north through
montana he urged his tiring tribe critical
though his dilemma was his genius was
equal to it he swerved deceived his pur-
suers and left them baffled behind him
when he could no longer avoid it he
halted and at canyon creek on september
  gave battle to three hundred and
fifty cavalrymen from howards and stur-
giss commands valiantly sturgis stormed
the ridges held by the nez perce riflemen
he captured nine hundred ponies and ex-
acted a toll of twenty-nine enemy dead for
his own loss of three but his men and
horses were exhausted when night fell and
he could not prevent josephs escape

  on joseph marched brushing aside small
bodies of troops in his way on toward the
bear paw mountains only thirty miles or

stories

so from the canadian border he reached
them and made camp-rest for the weary-
beside snake creek on the mountains north
slope

joseph could not know that there was
still another army column to be reck-
oned with far off to the east colonel
nelson a miles was waiting at fort
keogh wyoming for a report galloping
couriers brought him despatches from
sturgis detailing the probable route of the
nez perces there might yet be time to
intercept them

  miles moved at once with six companies
of the fifth infantry some of them
mounted two troops of the second cavalry
three of the seventh white and indian
scouts and two field guns and he moved
fast covering two hundred and sixty-seven
miles in twelve days on the cold stormy
morning of september   he was in
position to attack battle orders issued the
troops closed quietly in on the crescent-
shaped ravine where the nez perce tepees
were pitched

  some say joseph believed he had crossed
the border and was safe howard and
sturgis had deliberately held up their pur-
suit so as not to alarm him at any rate
he had no sentries out

  down on his camp thundered the cavalry
and mounted infantry sighted only as they
broke from cover for the last dash yet
not even the shock of the surprise could
break the stalwart nez perces in the
camp and on the ridges joseph rallied his
veterans troops of the second cavalry
captured the pony herd but the seventh
charging a ridge faced a deadly blast of
fire captain moylan and lieutenant god-
frey survivors of the little big horn were
shot from their horses severely wounded
and many another saddle emptied all along
the line the seventh its fighting spirit
undimmed dismounted deployed and
thrust ahead close to the summit it was
halted but held on there an orderly from
miles found the squadron commander
captain owen hale lying among the prone
troopers who were maintaining a rapid fire
on the enemy the generals compli-
ments and he directs-the orderly began
the military formula but hale didnt turn
or answer he was dead every other
officer but one of the squadron had been
rearguard action	

killed or wounded in that charge casual-
ties were fifty-three out of one hundred and
fifteen engaged

  joseph not only held his camp but under
fire made it strongly defensible with
knives tomahawks frying pans and a few
spades the toiling warriors dug entrench-
ments startlingly modern in their trans-
verses and connecting galleries and
joseph had sent messengers galloping to
canada to beg sitting bull to ride to his
rescue the sioux horde was only a days
march distant if it came riding down on
miles rear-

  miles also sent for reinforcements and
pressed the siege with all his might he
brought up his guns and shelled the camp
sitting bull did not come instead he
moved deeper into canada he had had
enough of the u s army

  for four days joseph held out then
at last a white flag fluttered over the nez
perce trenches

  a warrior advanced with josephs affect-
ing message of submission

  tell general howard that i know his
heart what he told me before i have it
in my heart i am tired of fighting our
chiefs are killed looking glass is dead
the old men are all dead it is the young
men now who say yes or no he who
led the young men joseph could not bear
to name his slain brother ollicut is dead
it is cold and we have no blankets the
little children are freezing to death my
people-some of them-have run away to
the hills and we have no blankets no food
no one knows where they are-perhaps
freezing to death i want to have time to
look for my children and to see how many
of them i can find maybe i shall find them
among the dead hear me my chiefs my
heart is sick and sad from where the
sun now stands i will fight no more for-
ever

  it was nearly sunset when joseph him-
self rode into the army lines head bowed
with grief hands clasped on a rifle over
the pommel of his saddle dismounting
he strode slowly toward the spot where
miles waited with general howard who
had ridden up with a small escort veter-
ans still recall the dignity the noble aspect
of the great chief from where his scalp
lock was bound with otter fur his hair fell

in long plaits over his chest there were
bullet scars on his cheeks and wrists and
bullet holes through the gray blanket over
his shoulders silently he proffered his
rifle in surrender to howard the general
generously motioned it toward miles

  the surrendered tribe straggled in a piti-
ful procession-eight-seven warriors forty
of them wounded one hundred and eighty-
four squaws and one hundred and forty-
seven children some of them also wounded
and all starved-looking

  with the unhurt warriors shackled the
chief and his band were escorted to the
nearest post there an army band was
guilty of a petty and tasteless gesture of
triumph in playing a selection from a cur-
rent musical comedy no no joseph

  worst was the stain on the nations
honor by its disposition of the conquered
miles had pledged the tribe would be re-
turned to a reservation in idaho the gov-
ernment coolly repudiated the terms of sur-
render and sent the mountain nez perces
to indian territory where the climate deci-
mated them although miles hands were
tied at the time that honorable officer
never rested until in  he succeeded in
arranging the return of the tribe to their
home lands there joseph lived to old
age the patriarch of his people counselling
them against fire-water and other vices and
keeping his promise to fight no more for-
ever

general sherman called the nez
perce war one of the most ex-
traordinary of which there is any record
he praised the tribes skill in using advance
and rear-guards skirmish lines and field
fortifications and for its forbearance after
the first outbreak from scalping mutila-
tions and for the most part from wanton
slaying of civilians

  the army had lost twenty-six in killed
and wounded to josephs two hundred and
thirty-eight in spite of great superiority
in strength and the invaluable aid of the
telegraph it had been outgeneraled and
much of the time outfought yet the
army could take pride in bravery displayed
on every field and in the dogged persever-
ance which had prevented the escape of
the nez perces to canada and won in the
end

by ray nafziger

        a creaking ox-cart saved tenderfoot sam walls from the
        deserts deadly grip and an ox-cart carried him on a
        peril ride to even a score with the hell-town of fortuna

sam walls stepped from the stage
coach as it rolled to a stop in for-
tuna jingling the remaining gold
eagles in his pocket and looking like a man
who craved action

  sam was a tenderfoot a no-good young
tenderfoot who had come west and was
recklessly squandering an inheritance of
several thousand dollars part of the
money had gone in tucson gambling and
helling around until somehow he had gotten
on the weekly stage to fortuna and for-
tuna was a tough little town with most of
its toughness stemming from the gibroy
brothers who owned the largest saloon a
big supply store and the wagon freighting
line to tucson both brothers could it
was said cool a keg of beer by just casting
their reptile-cold slate eyes over it

  it was unlucky for young walls-but
inevitable-that he fell into the gibroys
hands

  action is it youre wanting friend
asked eb gibroy genially and took the
tenderfoot in tow

  they had a few drinks at the gibroy
bar from there it was only a few short
steps to a poker game run by nate gibroy

  mr walls wants action eb gibroy
told his brother

  young walls remembered a day-and-
night spree in the gibroy saloon and after
that nothing when he woke up he found
himself in a section of what can well pass
for hell on earth-an arizona desert the
morning sun was already pouring down a
shriveling heat over sand and rock and
cactus

  how did i get here croaked samuel
seton walls miserably but he was too
sick to even try to guess thirst was turn-
ing his throat and mouth to hot ash while



a triphammer operated under a skull al-
ready as hot as the iron lid of a cook
range he lay clothed except for a hat
near a tall giant cactus with nothing to
be seen in a hundred miles but mountains
shrunken to blue haze in the oven of sky
and earth he sat up and yelled hoarsely
for help panic-stricken at the silence
he got to his feet and started to run taking
a dozen lead-footed staggering steps be-
fore he went down

  he got back a little sanity then he
had to save his strength there not being
much of it once more on his feet fight-
ing off waves of black nausea washing
over him he headed for a little hill from
which he hoped to sight the town of for-
tuna atop it near exhaustion he was
able to place himself fortuna he realized
lay far beyond a chain of hills to the north
it was farther than any man could hope to
walk in this blazing sun without water
in his condition poisoned by bad liquor
already so thirsty that he suffered the tor-
tures of the damned it was hopeless

he had been transported far out on
the desert and dumped he guessed
likely on the orders of the gibroys who
wanted to get rid of him in such a way that
he wouldnt live to squawk at having been
robbed in their saloon young walls
cursed in despair and again in a panic
started walking blindly in the sun again
he had a little atom of sense-enough to
fashion a framework of sticks covered with
his big red neckerchief to shield his bare
head from the broiling sun

  after that he just walked aimlessly pant-
ing becoming weaker stumbling and fall-
ing repeatedly to fight like a madman to
get back on his feet
before gibroy could fire again sams lash darted in

 walking with each step only a few
shuffling inches he headed for a rocky
pinnacle it gave him a destination and
an offer of shade beyond that he was too
far gone to think when he had wakened
he had been deathly sick from rotgut and
maybe some kicks on the head but that
was nothing to the sickness that came as
the sun literally cooked his tissues dry
if he had been fat sam walls would have
died the first hour but he was spare and
thin with the legs and lungs of a distance
runner

  he collapsed just as he reached the pin-
nacle a warning rattle came from a
snake using the same shade but when
walls lay indifferent to the threat the
snake slithered away

  walls knew he was close to death the
buzzards would soon gather to pick his
bones clean the pain of swelling tongue
and tortured throat the fever of his burn-

ing body grew steadily while the trip-
hammer still rose and fell in his bursting
brain numbly he prayed for death a
quick one

  he had lain perhaps an hour when into
the welter of agony crept an added tor-
ture a sound a high-pitched hellish
note that penetrated walls sick brain to
rasp against each separate cell

  he tried to think he was imagining it but
when it grew louder he rolled over and
forced his bloodshot eyes to stare into the
blazing waste and there moving waver-
ingly in walls blurred gaze was an ox-
cart drawn by a string of oxen threading
its way through the gaunt sahuaros its
square wooden pole frame piled high with
cargo beside the oxen walked a man
the ox-cart explained the hellish noise
it was the squeak of the dry wood axle
against the holes in the solid wheels made
of sawed sections of cottonwood trunk


	frontier

  so slowly did the outfit move that at
first walls thought it a mirage noise
however didnt go with mirages and
suddenly for samuel seton walls that
noise was music life

  the cart was due to pass two hundred
yards away and he gathered himself to get
to his feet and walk toward it what
began then was the hardest fight walls
had ever made a desperate gasping strug-
gle first to get to his knees he rolled on
his face and pushed up with his arms
resting he tried again to get to his knees
but trembling muscles simply couldnt lift
the leaden weight of his body it was no
go he was too far gone

  sobbing in despair he tried to yell but
his faint croaking was no louder than the
buzz of a small rattler and on squeaking
wheels foot by foot life was passing him
by he was like an exhausted shipwrecked
sailor on a raft unable to wave an arm to
a passing steamer

  one last hopeless attempt he was able
to make taking the makeshift hat he had
made of his neckerchief he placed it on
his right foot lying on his back strain-
ing every muscle lifting on the leg with
his hands he managed to raise it above
him to move it to and fro feebly

  there was one chance in a thousand that
the bullwhacker would see it-and the
whine of the ox-cart passed on walls
collapsed lying like an empty sack all will
and hope drained from him

unconsciousness came merci-
fully and then pain again water
was trickling against his horribly swollen
tongue walls opened his eyes to look
into the face of a gray-mustached mexican
holding him in his arms then the water
stopped and feebly walls fought for more
the mexican shook his head

  too mucho water ees no good too
mucho water kill joos like too mucho no-
water he spooned a little more water
against walls blackened tongue and then
bathed the heated body with a wet rag

  again walls senses faded when he
came to it was dark and he was lying on a
blanket by the side of the ox-cart with a
small fire a few feet away from a sooty
pot the leathery-faced mexican trickled
down walls throat a little warm coffee
with a dash of potent mexican liquor

stories

  walls with the mexican acting as nurse
slept fitfully during the night by morning
he could chew on a flat cornmeal tortilla
when the ox-cart journeyed on south
walls was lying in a little depression on
top the load with a piece of tarpaulin
raised above him for shade

  the springless cart jolted him unmerci-
fully but he didnt mind that the cart
meant water and food-life for three
days they traveled to reach a desert tank
where the oxen could fill up on water and
graze on a little coarse forage here the
mexican camped for two days resting for
the real ordeal of the journey which was
directly ahead a long desert sink so hell-
ishly hot that travel must be at night

  by then walls was able to eat his share
of beans and jerky and tortillas from
the little english the mexican spoke walls
learned that they were bound for a village
somewhere far to the south-a place called
san justo his rescuers name was justo
-justo reyes

  for two days the long-legged yellow and
brindle and spotted sonora oxen had grazed
on the little patch of forage chewing their
cuds solemnly and filling themselves to
bursting with water as if they knew what
lay ahead here after two huge barrels of
water were lashed to the ox-cart they
went on into the night the stars were
so close that one could almost touch them
the driver popped his whip and sang span-
ish songs walls himself for some reason
felt like singing

  they traveled all night and part of the
morning stopping in the shade of a rocky
hill when the sun became unbearable

  at dark when they went on walls started
to climb back into the cart but justo
grinned and shook his head kicking his
rawhide zapateros against the ground

  too mucho es-sand he explained
too mucho por bools you more better
walk no

  walls got the point the sand was loose
and deep a passenger meant too much
extra weight

  grumbling sweating he trudged along-
side the creaking cart laboring through the
deep sand watching the sand particles fall
from the wheels in little moonlit cascades

  for him still weak from his ordeal the
first hour was hell but the oxen moved
so slowly that he could keep up through
ox-carts to empire	

the deepest sand with necessary rests they
could travel at but little more than a mile
an hour again in the morning they
camped the men to lie in the shade of the
cart the oxen to eat the grain justo carried
for them

   night after night as they crawled through
the emptiness under the low-hanging stars
a change came over young sam walls a
re-birth

his hair-thin escape from deaths door
had started it and now moving
with the plodding oxen hearing the whine
of the slow-rolling big wood wheels and
the occasional popping of justos big whip
walls fell in spirit into the same slow
pace falling under the spell of a desert
night and the unhurried march of the oxen
for the first time in his life walls was
happy so happy he occasionally yelled
jubilantly at the stars

  he was having a good time just walking
along with justo and those snail-like steers
camping to eat brown beans flavored with
hot chili chewing jerky devouring stacks
of tortillas drinking coffee made from
alkali waterholes he helped justo yoke
up the big steers and spelled justo off in
driving them swinging the big whip mak-
ing it pop like a gun justo was a master
hand with a whip able to send the lash to
a target as surely as a man could shoot a
bullet young walls learned fast for
hours at a time he swung and popped the
braided length of rawhide

   they pulled out of the desert finally into
the foothills of a high peak to roll up a
canyon which widened suddenly into an
oasis of green fields guarded by a settle-
ment of brown adobe houses this was
san justo to which the ox-cart was bring-
ing supplies from the outside world the
whole populace flocked to greet justos cart
staring wonderingly at the stranger justo
exhibited walls proudly relating how he
had seen the moving cloth out of the corner
of an eye how he had debated going to
investigate how he had brought walls
back to life

   justo took walls in to live with his large
family and walls fell in with the peaceful
life of the village san justo liked the
blond young gringo and he liked the simple
people of san justo

-frontier stories-fall

  they showed him their wheat fields the
rows of green corn as tall as young trees
their chili and bean patches all irrigated
from the little canyon stream on the ad-
joining slopes and ridges ran cattle and
sheep and goats and in and out of the vil-
lage wandered great flocks of tame turkeys

  there was no way for walls to leave
but he did not want to go he was content
to live in the village to help in the fields
hoeing corn and beans cutting wheat with
a scythe to be threshed by the hoofs of
goats and taken to the molino to be ground
into flour

  he needed no money money in san
justo almost had no existence although
their granaries were overflowing with grain
there was no place to sell it they had
cattle and sheep to feed ten times their
number of people but there was no market
as for turkeys a whole city could have
been provided with thanksgiving birds

  when fall came to san justo those tur-
keys gave an idea to walls who had yankee
trading blood in him in the town of for-
tuna there would probably not be a single
gobbler for thanksgiving he remembered
a story he had heard of a californian who
had driven a big flock of turkeys to a
nevada mining town to sell for the holi-
days why couldnt he make a similar
drive to fortuna justo was planning
another trip for supplies and he could
carry feed and water for the turkeys the
summer heat was over

  walls bought the birds and their feed
for next to nothing using some twenty-
dollar certificates sewed in his leather belt
where they had escaped the notice of the
gibroys in october they started with
the turkey flock following the creaking ox-
cart out of the mountains hazed along by
walls and two helpers luck was with
him the deserts heat was not unbear-
able for the birds at night light bamboo
poles were set up as roosts

  arriving in fortuna two weeks before
thanksgiving the flock was corraled like
cattle and offered for sale for each bird
walls got a flat five dollars except for a
few raffled off for much more money in
a few days every back yard in fortuna had
a turkey tied by a leg waiting execution

  the gibroy brothers were away n tuc-
son bringing a wagon train of supplies for
their store and saloon sam walls had
frontier stories



not forgotten he had a score to settle with
them he had no doubt that they had
stranded him on the desert

it was partly his trading instincts and
partly the desire to settle with the
gibroys that took him to see vance cogwell
owner of the silver queen mine which was
fortunas sole excuse for existence

  i suppose you know the gibroys are
getting rich fast selling flour and meat to
your miners at hold-up prices walls
asked the mine owner

  cogwell looked at walls shrewdly ap-
praising him their prices are high he
admitted but the gibroys claim they pay
big money for flour in tucson and that
freighting it here across the desert with
mule teams is costly theres been plenty
complaints that the gibroys charge robbery
prices but can you do any better 

  i can sell good flour not that sawdust
the gibroys handle for less than half their
price for your mexican miners i can
bring in meal ground from blue flintcorn
the only kind fit for making tortillas at a
third of what the gibroys charge the
same goes for the beef and mutton i can
deliver here

  if you do all that cogwell warned
him youll be fighting the gibroys and
theyre tough men to buck

  walls grinned bleakly i found that
out theres a lot of grain and mutton
and beef down in san justo ill make it
my business to freight it up here

  cogwell shook his head thats a long
stretch of waterless desert to cross

  not for ox teams theyre slow but
sure they get where they head for
theyre made for the desert the deserts
can lick mules and horses but they cant
lick ox teams

  in the town he bought all the available
sacks and enough heavy wire to use for
the barrels which he planned to have native
carpenters make in san justo then he
justo and the turkey herders started their
long journey back sam walls turning over
schemes in his head as he trudged beside
the ox-cart

  he would set the little mill to grinding
wheat and corn day and night from his
turkey sales he had enough capital to buy
a few oxen and carts of his own the rest
he would hire the remainder of his money

would go to purchase cargoes meanwhile
he would hire other carts to take grain
and fodder up the trail to be left to feed
the cattle and sheep he planned to drive
to fortuna later

  on his return trip to fortuna young sam
walls led a train of a dozen ox-carts
groaning under loads of wheat flour and
cornmeal dried beef and mutton frijoles
and chili and garbanzos

  the vehicles creaked into the yard be-
hind the little store of an anglo with whom
walls had arranged to handle his san
justo freight even before the carts were
all unloaded news of the low prices to be
charged for san justo flour and other sup-
plies brought the town rushing to stock
up with flour and jerky and beans enough
to last them for weeks

  those prices cutting a half under the
gibroys must have been a thunderbolt to
the brothers walls knew the two werent
the kind to surrender their profits without
a fight he expected trouble and he had
worn a  single-action colt into san
justo while the ox-carts wended their
way north he had practiced shooting the
weapon he would need practice for eb
gibroy was counted a professional gunman
and his brother nate was almost as expert

  when he went to see cogwell the mine
owner greeted him worriedly

  you made it all right this trip ad-
mitted cogwell but can you keep it up 
summer as well as winter

  keep it up walls asked surprised
ive just started next trip im bringing
in sheep and cattle to be held here and
butchered out as needed theres enough
flour and beef and mutton in san justo to
feed two towns like this im taking a
stock for a store in san justo so ill be
carrying cargoes both ways ill have a
train leaving san justo every month
steers are mighty slow said cogwell
slow but sure said walls you
neednt be afraid of oxen failing to get
across the desert those long-horned
mexican steers may get down to skin and
bone but they dont quit traveling

  the gibroys called on me today said
cogwell they said if i allowed you to
freight in here theyd quit i told them i
wouldnt stop you but that means depend-
ing on your ox teams to feed the town
ox-carts to empire	

weve got to be sure your ox-carts get
here regularly

  theyll get here said walls confident-
ly and later on ill start ox teams
freighting between here and tucson

  see that they get here said cogwell
brusquely if there should be a food
shortage the mine would have to shut down
and that would ruin me ive got a cer-
tain payment to make every month if its
not made the mine will be taken away
from me and better watch out for the
gibroys theyre killers

  thats no news to me returned walls
with his train of carts he pulled out that
afternoon taking the street that passed
the gibroy saloon justo had advised him
to take another street sam walls himself
thought that might be smart but he had
too much pride to dodge the gibroys it
would be easy for them to blast him down
from a doorway as he passed but he doubted
they would try that fortuna would not
stand for a bushwhack killing if one of
the pair however should kill walls in an
open gun fight he would go clear

  walls in the lead with his bull team was
approaching the gibroy saloon when eb
stepped out to stand in the middle of the
street eb was wearing a sixshooter and
his face was contorted with rage

walls with his rawhide braided
whip looped over his shoulder the
butt in his hand stepped forward as the
oxen halted he had a flashing memory of
the torture which he had undergone on the
desert and rage shot through his slim body
in hot flashes

  damn you gibroy out of the way
he yelled

  gibroy smiled a little and then suddenly
his hand darted down to his sixshooter he
had no doubt but that he could best this
tenderfoot in a gun duel

  walls in his fury queerly wasnt think-
ing of the  on his hip he was no gun-
man he was a bullwhacker the shot-
loaded butt in his hand rose and went
swiftly back to send the whip length for-
ward with the speed of lightning gibroys
colt had just cleared leather when the split
end of the lash struck his face it hit just
below the right eye gouging out a chunk
of hide and flesh and temporarily blinding
that eye gibroy bellowed savagely a roar

that was heard for blocks but despite the
pain he leveled the sixshooter and fired it
was a blind shot the slug passing ten feet
over walls head before gibroy could
fire again the lash darted in again to gash
open a cheek it was more than gibroy
could bear he dropped his sixshooter and
flung up his arms to cover his head

  a warning hiss came from justo behind
walls and he swung to see nate gibroy
coming from the saloon carrying a win-
chester carbine

  again walls sent out the long bull whip
it curled around nate gibroys neck fas-
tening there in a tight loop walls jerked
on the whip just before nate pulled the
trigger the shot from the rifle dug into
an adobe wall across the street

  gibroy throwing down the lever of the
winchester in hot haste was off balance
and a two-handed jerk on the whip yanked
him from his feet he scrambled to his
knees however to raise his rifle for an-
other shot walls ran in to strike with
the leaded butt of his bull whip it
smashed into gibroys jaw knocking him
flat but doggedly he turned the barrel
toward walls

  walls kicked the barrel aside and struck
again this time gibroy crumpled as if
he had been kicked by a mule it was
only then that walls thought of the six-
shooter he carried he drew it to turn
toward the saloon doorway on guard
against attack from the hard cases that
tended bar and trimmed suckers for the
gibroys none of them even stuck out a
head for one reason justo had his old
muzzle-loading shotgun to his shoulder
ready for action

  as nate gibroy groaned and moved a
little and his brother cursed with the pain
of his slashed face the town marshal came
running up he was not needed the fight
was over the gibroys had had enough

  the ox-carts rumbled on out into the
desert it was miles before walls anger
subsided he should have killed the
gibroys he realized as they had intended
to kill him alive the gibroys were a
deadly menace they would try to get
him again the next time from ambush

  that attack did not come on sam walls
next trip north when he brought sheep
and cattle nor did it come on the second
one it did not even come when one of
	frontier

his newly-purchased ox-cart trains went
boldly to tucson to haul out supplies for
the mines and to bring merchandise to
fortuna part of those supplies went to
san justo-taking to the village steel plows
and grain reapers carpets window glass
furniture bolts of cloth dresses and hats
mirrors-things which had passed for im-
possible luxuries in san justo before the
coming of the gringo ox-cart freighter and
trader

  the mule and horse teams of the gibroys
could not compete with the oxen and their
bullwhackers and the gibroys began to
withdraw from the freighting business
slow the oxen were but sure and sure
slow walls the young freighter came to
be called

  walls was losing his uneasiness over the
gibroys when without warning they struck

he was in san justo at the time hav-
ing sent a train north weeks before
walls was leisurely getting ready to fol-
low with another caravan when the fortuna
store-keeper who handled his san justo
flour and meat shipments rode in on a horse
that was all but dead from the long desert
trip he shouted hoarsely for walls

  hells broke loose he burst out when
walls appeared gang of men dressed
like apaches jumped your last ox-train just
south of fortuna burned the loads and
the carts they werent apaches the
gibroys hired them but it cant be proved
-the gibroys were in fortuna at the time
and moren that the gibroys been send-
ing men into my store to buy up all the
flour and beans in stock i sold out clean
figuring on that train coming in the
gibroys claim their store is empty that
means theres no grub in town people
there will starve

  cant you get stuff hauled from tuc-
son 

  the gibroys wont haul anything and
other freighters are too scared of the
gibroys apaches to make the trip
whats happened is that the gibroys are
in cahoots with the bank cogwell owes
money to for developing his mine if
theres no grub the mine will have to shut
down that means cogwell cant make
his payment on time and he loses the
mine

  sam walls mouth tightened cogwell

stories

had depended on him to get grub to the
town now through no fault of his own
walls had failed rather than starve the
miners would quit fortuna try to trek
out with their families to tucson afoot if
necessary

  walls swore ill get you a fresh horse
to ride back to fortuna tell cogwell to
sit tight ill have grub there itll be
there sure and this trip it wont be slow

  he began shouting orders boys raced
out to drive in oxen from pastures while
the rest of the village hurried to load carts
and to fill water barrels in two hours ten
ox-carts loaded with food and barrels of
water were rolling north drawn by the
strongest oxen of the village and accom-
panied by a dozen men all well armed

  it was the beginning of the hot season
again and making speed in the killing heat
seemed impossible there would be no
water until they reached tinaja asul the
tank where a supply of water was found
the year around to provide water for
the dry haul walls was taking two extra
carts loaded with barrels of water these
would turn back after the water was used

  hour after hour the big carts rolled
northward to the tune of creaking axles
popping whips and the hoarse shouts of
drivers sam walls headed the caravan
setting the pace and planning the stops
ahead to take advantage of a little avail-
able forage which could be used to eke
out the feed carried on the carts

  a furnace-like heat billowed in on them
immediately they dropped into the sand
rock waste of the long sink walls knew
then that the drive would be a man-killer
and ox-killer they could not afford to
travel only at night laying over the long
hot days they could rest only a few hours
water was doled out sparingly just enough
to keep the oxen moving and when that
was gone they judged they could barely
reach the tinaja azul after which a
long dry stretch remained to fortuna
broken by a single spring

  the steers bellowed mournfully when
the water gave out but they moved through
the furnace-like heat unfalteringly great
horned heads bowed under the cottonwood
yokes pulling steadily through sand and
dry and rocky washes the eight food
carts halted only in the extreme heat of
the day
ox-carts to empire	

  ahead loomed through the heat hazes
the sharp peak in which tinaja asul pro-
vided a never-failing store of water miles
distant from the peak the steers seemed
to remember that water for they quick-
ened their pace and the drivers had to
force themselves to keep up they moved
all of one day to pull after dark into a
rocky bowl rimmed with clumps of high
prickly pear growing out of sand and
stone in that rocky bowl a series of
pools caught flood water the carts
halted and the drivers strode wearily with
pails to the edge of the first pool

  then at what they saw from a dozen
cracked lips came loud curses the tanks
were dry tracks showed that a band
of riders had halted at the place to empty
the reservoirs leaving only a cracked plas-
ter of dried mud in the bottoms

walls stood shoulders drooped too
overwhelmed by this disaster to curse
the gibroys it was four days drive to
the next water a small spring that could
not be harmed by the gibroys the oxen
could never make it nor could they reach
water on the back trail they were done
and he would have to fail cogwell and
fortuna leaving the people there either
to starve or try to make it out to tucson

  recovering a little walls suddenly
cursed the desert as he had done that day
when it had nearly killed him blaspheming
the great emptiness baked by merciless
sun its rocks and sand and the high weird
growths of prickly pear which grew in
huge-stemmed clumps about the tanks he
had lied to cogwell when he said the desert
could not lick oxen it had these oxen
licked it had him licked

  then he glanced at the prickly growth
again and stopped swearing he was
wrong they werent licked-not yet the
men had returned to slump by their ox-
carts exhausted walls shouted at them
and led them up the slope to the nearest
clump of prickly pear several men car-
ried machetes and with these they set to
work hacking out piles of the great oval
pulpy stems while the others dragged them
to a fire to singe off the spines chopping
them into pieces they carried them to the
oxen the animals only snuffed at them
refusing to eat although the bruised pulp
held undoubted moisture

  walls had an idea he brought out kegs
of sorghum from the carts and smeared
the sweet thick liquid over the pear the
oxen began to chew the pear was a poor
substitute for water but had lived for
months on waterless mesas obtaining both
moisture and food from the arid vegeta-
tion the san justo draft steers were
cousins of those camel-like animals or-
dinary farm draft oxen would never even
have reached the tank but these steers
were rawhide tough and they had fighting
hearts their breed had died in the bull-
rings fighting hopeless odds they were
tough enough now to eat prickly pear plants
and to move the carts on when they had
rested part of the loads were cached
near the tanks and in their place the carts
carried great bundles of the prickly pear
for use on the way there was enough
succulence in the plants and the sorghum
to enable the animals to chew the dry pear
and move steadily on through hell al-
though they gaunted down until their big
ribs pushed out the thick vari-colored hides

  when the train pulled up out of the long
sink the carts rolled along more easily
what was a journey of four days they did
in less than three to reach the spring it
was too small to provide more than half
rations of water but fortuna at last was
within striking distance which meant
also that the gibroy gang was within strik-
ing distance of the ox-carts the store-
keeper had taken back word that the carts
were coming it was only reasonable to
suppose that the gibroys would plan to
prevent their arrival

  anticipating an attack the drivers car-
ried their weapons ready for action while
sam walls ranged ahead of the caravan
scouting several miles in advance of the
creaking carts

  he discovered the gibroy gang one
night-a dozen men or more camped on
the far side of a ridge near a little slot
through which the carts would have to
pass plainly they were waiting here to
attack to surprise the san justo drivers
as they strung through the rocky defile

  walls hurried back to the train and or-
dered camp made it was four or five
hours until morning after resting until
near dawn he led all but two of the driv-
ers to approach the ridge of rock from
the back crawling close to the camp
	frontier

fire which by now was a bed of coals the
group waited until down trail the loud
squeaking of axles and wheels sounded
two carts moving along the trail

  one of the men sleeping about the fire
ed gibroy got up to kick up the flames
the camp was in a little cup where the
light of the fire would be hidden and a
breeze would blow the warning smoke
away from the moving carts

  get up theyre coming said eb gib-
roy and dont let a man git away this
time were makin it a massacre so bloody
a killin there wont be any more freighters
darin to come out of san justo

  this was to be walls guessed a simple
massacre of all the ox-cart men so there
would be none left to tell whether the
attackers were apaches or not if this job
was done right the gibroys would be
masters of kortuna with a share in the
big silver mine and rich enough to silence
any suspicions that they and not apaches
had perpetrated the ox-cart massacre

nate gibroy joined his brother and
in leisurely fashion the other men
prepared to get up there sounded the
click of a rifle-one of the san justo
weapons-being cocked eb placing a
coffee pot on the fire turned his head
whos there he called

  me sam walls came the reply from
the rocks rimming the little cup those

sirs 

  i have been given a copy of your magazine
frontier stories and like it so well that i have
sent for the next issue

  those old-time letters please me as i was a
covered-wagon passenger and remember many
humorous and thrilling incidents that occurred on
the six-months trip through the indian-infested
country when the savages were on the warpath
naturally i enjoy the stories about those strenu-
ous times

  having read oregon ho and sabers and
scalp-knives by william heuman i must say
that he really knows his subject and he does
keep the suspense stalking through

  some authors write at great length about their
characters their emotions etc but he merely
writes enough about the people in his stories so
that you can get an idea of what they are like
then he writes the story with one event following
another until the conclusion

  i lived in idaho for sixteen years before mov-
ing to the oregon coast by way of the old ore-
gon trail and i know many old-time yams of
the region whenever pioneer picnics were held
i was always on the front bench to hear the
authentic tales from the old-timers themselves of
their trials and hardships in settling the west

  from all of my knowledge of the early frontier
days i truly agree with other pony express
writers in saying that there is more truth than
fiction in frontier stories and i want to add
that mr heumans stories are really lifelike
i enjoy frontier stories very much and am
sorry they are not published oftener than four
times a year

sirs 

  i started reading your magazine last summer
and cursed my luck for not running into it
sooner one reason that i like your mag is that
it does not feature a bunch of singing cowboys
the characters in the stories you publish are not

just a group of people who talk and shoot they
are the very spirits of those men who died on the
little big horn-men who hunted trapped and
scouted the rolling plains of the wilderness-and
of the frontier women who stood by their men-
folk through thick and thin and even the amer-
ican indian who usually plays the under-dog in
your stories can be proud that writers have not
forgotten his heroic fight to keep his west free-
the west that strengthened the american empire

  today the white man and the red man still
fight but they are united against a common foe
-the jap

  i especially liked the installments of fairfax
downeys indian-fighting army i would ap-
preciate it if you could tell me where i could
buy the complete book union cavalry stories

trash-or history

sirs

 i have been reading frontier stories and
other westem-story publications for a long time
and i have never written a letter either criticiz-
ing or favoring the respective magazine but
after reading eustace rutherfords letter con-
demning the many magazines which try to bring
back in the minds of the people the days of the
old west i say what utter rot

  did it ever occur to this connoisseur of read-
ing matter that there might be a great many
people who enjoy this trash

  mr rutherford criticized wagon people for
fighting indians how does he suppose the west
was settled-with bean blowers

  if everybody had the rutherford viewpoint
there would be no point in fighting for our coun-
try after all in a few years the history of this
present war would be only outdated trash

hells caravan

by m howard lane

the carson sink camp was an

oasis to those emigrants who had
travelled near three thousand miles
t view fabled california and at the same
time it was a disappointment for the high
barrier of the sierra nevadas still lay be-
tween them and the promised gold of the
sacramento

  willow-lined argonaut creek and a

few gnarled sycamores gave their modi-
cum of shade to the camp where incoming
emigrant trains rested galled and weary
oxen before going on

  here a man who had been misfortunes
victim might find an opportunity to join
some on-going train that at least was


dust in the east and thorpe daniels hailed it as a boon
he could not know that the coming caravan was marked
for a fearful end in a desert of whitened bones

a novelet of treachery

thorpe daniels hope but as the weary
weeks had passed and no conestoga cara-
van had lifted high tilts above the deserts
eastern edge he had almost ceased to hope
for the coming of a wagon-master who
might find a place for a scout with a
crippled hand

thorpe flexed his fingers as he took his

on the california trail

accustomed afternoon seat on a tall boul-
der at the edge of the creek camp from
the rock he could watch for sign of wag-
ons making their slow way here across the
salt desert

  the eyes of friendly women in the emi-
grant camp where a few families had de-
cided to wait through the winter before


	frontier stories

tackling the long onward- trail to oregon
watched thorpe sympathetically they saw
him seated then shook their heads sadly
and their tongues began to clack

  one shook her head worriedly

  i hear tell from that last trapper who
come through that sioux on the plains
have slaughtered so many emigrants that
none are making it across south pass an
them that have reached salt lake are be-
ing forced to pay the mormons tribute
i wonder whats going to happen to that
poor thorpe daniels

  i have heard it said the womans
companion answered that mr daniels is
apt to strike out for california alone if
a train doesnt come along soon and
hes just the one to take that chance a
shame it is that the pack of trappers and
scouts who brought him here couldnt have
waited until his fever was gone before
pulling out what if his hand was caught
in a beaver trap by accident i still cant
see why they didnt wait for his health to
mend particularly after they told me he
stood high in the councils of mountain
men

   he insisted that they go on the first
woman explained patiently he is not a
man to be burdensome to anyone and
now that he can hold a rifle again you
know that the game he has brought in has
been worth more than its weight in that
california gold people brag about hes
more than paid back our kindness for
one i hope he stays the winter-

  her voice trailed off at she stared un-
seeingly off to the west

  as he hunched atop his lookout thorpe
knew that he was the subject of conversa-
tion beneath the sycamores and the knowl-
edge made his ears feel hot grimly he
went to work flexing his right hand trying
patiently to force resilience into muscles
that time alone would knit yes time
and until that hand was good as new
thorpe daniels knew bitterly that he could
not strike out for california alone

  slowly he twisted on his hard seat a
long wide-shouldered man in travel-worn
buckskins and crow moccasins he let
his agate-brown eyes wander westward
across wide leagues of dangerous desert to
the towering barrier of the blue sierra
beyond those mountains lay the golden
valley of the sacramento mecca of thou-

sands since a nugget had been found in the
mill-race of sutters sawmill at coloma

  more than the lure of nuggets in amer-
ican river gravel though was calling
thorpe daniels to california it was the
same urge that had made him disobey a
father who had insisted on the completion
of a college career for which he had no
taste restlessness was what some men
call it fiddle-footed and yet the real
truth was that ten years spent on the fron-
tier had not brought him contentment for
he could not be sure just what he was
seeking-

  that was why he stared at the distant
blue of pine-clad sierra and the savage
dun hue of the salt desert it was why he
wished glumly that he was already there
in that yonder land beyond the mountains
for somehow thorpe had the feeling that
his restless days would end in california
perhaps on some oak-shaded rancho where
a man could grow with a new state

  if only a caravan would come one
willing to take a cripple on with them he
could support the barrel of a rifle in that
right hand now but the fingers would not
close enough yet to grasp the green river
blade at his belt or hold the weight of the
long navy colt holstered at his opposite
thigh he could not hoist an ox-yoke or
handle an axe but he could sit a horse
and his eyes were keen

  dispiritedly thorpe turned back from
his contemplation of the peaks that barred
him from california and as he switched
his long length around something that
none of the carson camp people had seen
in a long time caught his eye it was dust
dust billowing high into an azure cloud-
less sky

  dust kicked up by the hooves of plod-
ding oxen dust rolling upward from be-
neath high conestoga wheels a caravan
was coming-at last

a shout that he couldnt hold back
left thorpes lips he saw figures
in the camp beneath the sycamores spring
to their feet men and women alike they
came pellmelling toward his lookout rock
and their cries echoed his own shout
worn faces began to smile children in
homespun raced about with glee for they
knew there would be youngsters in the
approaching train with whom to play men
hells caravan

running low on tobacco showed their hope-
fulness of replacing dwindling supplies
the women thought of news they might
learn and thorpe thought that now he
might be able to start on the last lap of his
journey to california

  purple shadows were washing over the
salt desert by the time the incoming train
splashed across the ford of argonaut
creek gaunt oxen wheeled high-tilted
conestoga and pittsburgh wagons into an
open section of the camp and thorpe
watched the scene from his place on the
high rock he had asked eph saunders
the camp boss to get word to the wagon-
master of the incoming train that a man
was here who wanted to hook up with their
outfit it would break the ice when he
approached the leader of the new caravan

  but even as he thought about it thorpe
felt a frown growing on his forehead
eyes that years of frontier living had
sharpened saw things about this new batch
of emigrants that he couldnt understand

  one oddity immediately caught his at-
tention the travel-stained women of the
caravan were making no attempt to greet
the emigrants wives already settled in this
carson sink camp there was a sullen-
ness about them that was hard to under-
stand the men too were going about
the task of rounding the cavvy with un-
accustomed haste into the wagon circle
they had formed others were cutting
wood and keeping to themselves still
others were silently unyoking the weary
oxen

  it was that silence which puzzled
thorpe making camp was usually a
noisy boisterous undertaking

  one man bigger than the rest in quilled
buckskin appeared to be their leader his
movements about the camp were quick and
lithe as a cougars a magnificent mane
of black hair reached back to the beaded
collar of his leather shirt when he was
near thorpe noticed that men jumped to
hurry their tasks

  a regular he-heller the scout mut-
tered half to himself

  carson camp emigrants who had been
joyfully awaiting the sight of new faces
and new tongues to bring them word of
happenings along the oregon-california
trace were slowly retreating toward their
own wagons in abashed confusion



  beats me a voice muttered from the
base of the rock

  thorpe looked down eph saunders
was staring up at him out of puzzled blue
eyes i aint never seen a bunch like that
before he confided stand-offish as all
git out their capn that feller in the
frilled breeches calls hisself bent arcane

i	told him we had a feller wanting to hitch
up with them and hes willin to talk with
ye he dont have no remarks to make
concernintheir back-trail just dont have
nothin to say ceptin they are pulling out
come mornin

  thorpe had noticed another thing about
the mystery caravan their stock is
ganted pretty bad he told the camp boss
as he slid to the ground a smart cap-
tain would rest up for a couple of days
before tackling the desert ahead

  i know that as well as you saunders
snapped irritably theres something
funny about the outfit twelve wagons
arcanes got and that dont seem like a
proper-sized train for crossin plains and
mountains most captains wait until they
can get leastways twice that number be-
fore striking out from council grove-
everything eph saunders had said was
true and thorpe knew that the camp boss
was hoping that he would not press his
chance to go on with an outfit that acted
so strangely

  id wait over eph he murmured as
they approached the new camp except
that ive got to get started for california
pronto if i expect to get there before
sierra snow blocks emigrant gap

thorpe ducked beneath a wagon
tongue tilted to the endgate of the
conestoga ahead as a girl popped her head
through the opening in the tilt above him
oh- thorpe heard her say in surprise
and he glanced up and straightened

  you- she began again

  im from yonder camp maam
thorpe told her politely and the smile that
came to his lips was the most spontaneous
that had touched his face in months ive
come to see if your captain will take me
on to california he explained

  the girl had been lovely and would be
lovely again when the fatigue of this long
journey was out of her bones tiredness
showed in the fine lines etched about he
	frontier

red lips and in the shadows beneath her
dark eyes her body was slender and
yet rounded beneath the drab brown of her
dress but as he studied her thorpe read
more than fatigue in her face fear sor-
row or both had keyed her to a tight pitch

  he watched the girls lips part and then
suddenly close at the sound of a step be-
hind him he had already heard the whis-
per of moccasins but the expression that
crossed the girls face had kept him from
turning now as he saw the words she
had been about to speak freeze on her lips
he swung without undue haste to see who
was approaching

  the black-haired leader of the caravan
stood there but for a moment bent arcane
ignored the crippled scout his eyes
blacker if possible than his hair were
tipped up to the girl in the wagon

  sarah he said sharply your mother
is asking for you

  i-i was just going to help her the
girl stammered when-when this gentle-
man surprised me

  she started to climb down across the
end-gate and natural courtesy made
thorpe step forward to help her without
thinking he lifted his right hand and caught
the girls elbow but as her weight came
against his palm pain leaped to his shoulder
instinct made him lose his grip and sweat
broke on his forehead pain had whitened
his lips when the girl looked up

  ive hurt you she exclaimed
mister-

  daniels thorpe muttered dont feel
bad about my hand its ached a heap sight
worse

  im sarah bums the girl said and her
smile was friendly

  she was probably twenty-one but bent
arcane treated her as though she were a
child or a chattel of his own if you
dont get to helping your mother and the
rest of the women prepare supper youll
find yourself hungry he warned coldly

  thorpe watched her speed from them
and her run was graceful as the flight of a
falling leaf after she had joined the other
women about the cook-fire thorpe made
another slow turn to face the mystery cara-
vans leader and he realized instantly that
a more inopportune meeting could not have
been arranged arcanes face was long and
gaunt even in the heat of this high desert

stories

it looked chilly but there was nothing
chilly about his eyes hell-fire and damna-
tion burned in their depths bent arcane
wanted no man to look twice at sarah
burns

  youre the one saunders was talking
to me about the captain said abruptly

  thorpe nodded carefully yes he
admitted a trap caught my hand when
me and some pards made a set this side of
salt lake just for luck it was luck all
right but tne wrong kind for me blood
poison set in i made my friends go on
and leave me here the women in this
camp saved my hand but it aint much use
yet howsomever its good enough to han-
dle a rifle and ram home a ball my eyes
aint bad either when it comes to pickin
up injun sign so i figured i might scout
and hunt for my keep

  thorpe watched arcanes eyes narrow
and he was braced for the captains no

  but the exact opposite was coming
ever been to califomy before bent
arcane asked at the shake of thorpes
head he seemed pleased i think we can
use you daniels he said crisply youll
eat with the rest of us were well found
and ive copies of maps colonel fremont
made when he and kit carson crossed
walker pass into owens valley it will
cut a hundred or more miles off the regu-
lar route over emigrant gap

  words were on thorpes lips but he
stifled them john c fremont with kit
carson for guide had found and named
walker pass all right but this train was
already far north of the path those explor-
ers had blazed in 

  thus bent arcane was either stupid or
a liar-and the captain did not look stupid

  why was this man purporting to lead
his train of a dozen wagons over a short-
cut into californias promised land when
the route he wanted lay far to the south
thorpe asked himself and he found no
answer in his mind time might give him
the solution and suddenly the scout knew
that wild horses could not keep him from
accompanying this mystery caravan

  youve hired a hand arcane he mur-
mured ive my own horse a bay gelding
named ranger hell be glad to travel
again and so will i our worst danger
from here on will be the paiutes theyre
lizard-eating coyotes who will fill a man
hells caravan	

with arrows if they get him alone other-
wise they will concentrate on your herds

i	hear they have a taste for ox meat
you have heard a lot daniels the
train captains long narrow face had hard-
ened and i hope you will keep your
fears to yourself we do not discuss mat-
ters that might rouse concern in the cara-
van good night to you now and be
ready on that ranger horse of yours to
pull out in the morning

  thorpe nodded and he wondered if he
could manage to keep his temper under
control for the long leagues that still lay
between them and california

  i will do my best he murmured

  one more thing before you leave
bent arcane snapped as thorpe turned to
go you might as well know that sarah
burns is my intended wife she and her
mother are travelling to california under
my personal escort

  thorpe felt his lips draw in against his
teeth i shall remember he murmured
he turned and walked away

  eph saunders met the scout along
the creek on the way back to the main
camp and what do you think of that
outfit 

  thorpe walked a few paces before an-
swering i think he said finally that it
is a caravan full of fear and hatred
arcane is playing a game and he is using
human beings for his chess men-

ii

tftatch up catch up that cry
v for five days now had awakened
thorpe at each dawn five days fifty
miles and the sierras seemed no nearer
they were still a blue barrier barring the
southern horizon but the dun desert was
very real about them paiutes lurked in
cut-bank washes eager to drive off the
cavvy that followed under heavy guard be-
hind the lumbering wagons

  two dozen cattle in one lightning raid
had been lost and one of the guards had
died in the attack his body riddled with
arrows they had buried him alongside
the dim trace

  wing scout for the caravan thorpe was
away from the wagons between each dawn
and dusk which gave him no opportunity
to speak alone with sarah burns and as

for the evenings talk was out of the ques-
tion after the night meal each family
sought their own wagon none of the
jolly group singing that made argonauts
forget the hazards of the day was evident
nothing livened the drabness

  it helped to increase thorpes impres-
sion that something was wrong here

  the sixth night came and the sierras
seemed miraculously nearer the appar-
ent nearness of the mountains brought
smiles to the gaunt faces of women and
the harried lips of men who hadnt smiled
in days

  thorpe watched sarah burns rise from
the circle where all were eating and she
said clearly enough for all to hear this
is a night for song i have a banjo in my
trunk but mother has a lot of things
packed on top of it mr daniels wont
you come and help me get it well treat
the folks to oh susanna-

  it is my chore bent arcane said
smoothly and rose from his place beside
the cook-fire a man with a bad hand
shouldnt be lifting packing cases

  my hand thorpe said and he hardly
recognized his own voice is fine

  bent arcanes laugh was chilly as the
snows that would soon mantle the sierras
he came stepping toward the scout and
thorpe found himself moving forward to
meet the man he caught a glimpse of
sarah bums frightened face and then
the girl was trying to step between them

  thorpe brushed her aside with his good
arm this had to come sometime sarah
one mans got to be tall around here
it wont be you daniels arcane spoke
through set handsome lips

  the captain lashed out with a whistling
blow and like a dancer thorpe ducked
youve got to do better than that he
taunted hoping his words might blind
arcane with fury he sent his own left
looping out as he spoke and the blow
grazed the captains cheek

  arcanes fists came then like driving
pistons a blow on the chest staggered
thorpe backward a right smashed
through his guard and he felt the salt taste
of blood in his mouth as gore spurted from
his nose the captain was pressing his
advantage boring forward deliberately step
by step and the scout knew he was beaten
his right hand would not close into a fist
	frontier

and one stabbing left was not enough to
protect himself against the flailing knuckles
of the wagon master

  stand and take it damn you bent
arcane rasped

  thorpe had been constantly backing
hopeful that he might yet draw the captain
within range of a left powerful enough to
drop him against his back then he felt
the sudden heat of the community cook
fire and he knew that another backward
pace would carry him into it

  he took a single step forward and
hammered a desperate left straight toward
the triumphant face of the wagon master
but the blow found nothing but thin air
for arcanes right had risen from the
neighborhood of his waist and hard
knuckles beneath his chin were lifting him
from his feet

  thorpe felt the powerful muscles in his
own body growing lax there was no
strength left in his knees he saw the
ground rising and had only one vagrant
glow of satisfaction he had kept his
head and managed to refrain from strik-
ing a blow with his weakened right hand
then he was on the ground and the blow
to his jaw had paralyzed him from head to
heel unconsciousness was coming yet
oddly it was not here yet he could still
see dimly and hear

  he saw bent arcane loom above him
saw the mans hobnailed boot rise and he
read the wicked intent in the others eyes
he heard sarah burns cry out and he
heard the hoarse voice of one of the emi-
grants exclaim

  leave be arcane we felt the same
as you when we split from jim carrigans
party and started on alone we owe car-
rigan all the trouble we can make him but
this feller wasnt one o them leave be i
say throw him out if yuh want for the
paiutes to scalp but i draw the line at
trompin him-

he had been tromped just the same
that was the first conscious thought
thorpe had when heat that seared his body
like the white blast from a furnace roused
him to consciousness he tried to open
his eyes and failed and for a terrorized
moment he thought his sight was gone
then the realization came that dried blood
had glued his lids together thirst burned

stories

his throat and every muscle throbbed with
its own individual song of pain

  some emigrant had remonstrated with
arcane thorpe remembered dazedly but
the caravan captain had tromped him just
the same the emigrant had suggested
that they throw him out on the salt desert
for the paiutes to scalp and thorpe ex-
ploring blindly with his hand touched brit-
tle sage and sand the feel of it made
him want to laugh but he couldnt for his
tongue seemed cloven to his mouth theyd
done a good job in that caravan of mys-
tery was the wild thought that came into
his fogged mind yes a damned fine job
abandoned him to the paiutes and the
sun while their wagons rolled on west-
ward

  another wave of unconsciousness was
sweeping over him and he tried to fight it
with all the power of his will

  go to sleep again he muttered the
words aloud in an effort to rouse himself
completely and youll never see califor-
nia and that rancho lookin out to the sea

  but the unconsciousness was coming de-
spite his talk and yet oddly enough a girls
voice seemed to be coming right along with
it thorpe thorpe ive found you-

  it sounded like sarah burns but thorpe
knew that couldnt be true bent arcane
would never have given her the chance to
slip away from the caravan that was his
last conscious thought

  then blackness swept over him

  the sensation of being pulled through
scrubby sage that ripped at his buckskin
clothes and of being slid as gently as pos-
sible down the steep sides of a cut-bank
wash was the next impression that roused
the scout

  this aint the road to hell he heard
himself chuckle wildly its too hot down
there for sage and sand-

  thorpe that feminine voice said
again and water blessedly cool touched
his lips a damp cloth was at his face sud-
denly sponging the dried blood from his
eyes and nose

  with an effort the scout managed to
pry his lids apart for an instant they
sagged back as though to close and then
surprise jerked him to full awareness
staring unbelievingly up he looked into
the face of the argonaut girl

  sarah the water had lubricated his
hells

throat and loosened his tongue sarah
you here i-

  dont try to talk the girl com-
manded i left your rifle where i found
you rest until i come back here- she
pressed a pitifully small leather water bag
into his hands-drink when you get
thirsty

  roused completely thorpe felt the
weight of the bottle well save it for
later he murmured and he had to fight
down the almost uncontrollable urge to lift
the bag to his lips and drain its last drop

  brain whirling with speculation he lay
still feeling the little water he already
had drunk start to bring the tingle of life
back to a body that had been mercilessly
beaten

  shimmering heat devils danced at the
rim of the dun-hued cutbank wash across
from him heat devils that would destroy
them unless more water could be found
quickly and the paiutes had a habit of
lurking near the water-holes waiting for
lost argonauts or men separated from
their wagons there was another danger
too sarah had not wasted her strength
to drag him into this deep wash without
reason evidently the fear was in her that
bent arcane and his men might come
looking for them

  the thought made thorpe glance down
at his right hand he hadnt had much
time to think about it but now the sight of
his arm brought a chuckle to his lips the
hand still wasnt worth much but arcane
and his tromping boots had neglected to
undo the siow healing process by smash-
ing it a second time

  that single fact was something a man
could almost take as a good omen but
well need plenty more thorpe muttered
before we make it back to the carson
camp i wonder if she managed to steal
a horse for us to ride

  he heard the crisp sound of the girls
small boots coming back to the wash and
it was his answer sarah burns had left
the mystery caravan on foot thorpe
pulled a ragged breath into his lungs
swiftly he calculated the miles they had
travelled away from the carson sink camp
six days at ten or twelve miles a day
there were waterholes along the backward
trail but there were paiutes too

  that knowledge was a challenge and

caravan	

thorpe accepted it as such a girl with
the bravery of sarah burns deserved bet-
ter than a desert death well make it
through he told himself im not going
to let her die

  she came sliding into the wash and her
face grew radiant as she saw how he had
managed to prop himself against the bank
youre better she exclaimed i was
afraid theyd broken an arm or one of
your legs

  sarah was wearing a boys hickory shirt
and brown corduroy breeches at least
she wouldnt be burdened with a womans
bulky clothes on the walk to come in one
hand thorpe saw that she had his rifle
powder horn and shot pouch in the
other she carried a weighted flour sack
crouched down beside him she opened
the sack and spilled forth its contents

  your revolver she said proudly i
thought we might need six quick loads in
case six paiutes saw us all at once she
laughed almost gaily and bread she
went on and jerked ox meat from the
last one we had to slaughter so we wont
have to turn into lizard-eaters thorpe

  thorpe daniels looked at the girl and
he couldnt understand her she had been
sullen tired and fearful in arcanes camp
but there had been the security of num-
bers now she was alone on the desert
with a man to whom shed spoken no more
than a dozen words facing the crazed
death that thirst brought or the shattering
horror of a flint-tipped arrow in the back
yet she could smile it brought back to
his mind all the strangeness hed sensed in
the arcane caravan questions filled his
mind but there were more pressing mat-
ters to settle first

  the girl handed him a bit of bread torn
from the loaf she had displayed and a
strip of jerky breakfast she said
gaily

  thorpe accepted the food and even the
movement of laying it on his lap brought
torment to bruised muscles talk comes
first he told her gravely weve got to
decide some things right now i make it
close to sixty-five miles back to carson
sink and death will be waiting for us
every inch of the way your outfit cant
be more than five or six miles ahead-even
if they moved on without you

  thorpe spoke slowly because the words
	frontier

were hard to bring out my-my advice
to you is to leave me this stuff and head
back to them you can walk faster than
oxen can pull a wagon youll meet up
with them by sunset and be safe again
stay with me- thorpe cut his sentence
short ears keened to habitual alertness
had picked up the sound of hooves out
along the trace

  with a movement as clumsy as an old
man trying to rise from a chair the scout
pushed the water bag aside and pulled
himself to his feet

  lithe as a fawn sarah burns was al-
ready pressed against the bank dark eyes
on a level with the lip of it arcane
her whisper came faintly to the scout and
he had never heard a word spoken with
more venom kill him thorpe the girl
implored shoot him while youve got
the chance hes more dangerous than a
mad dog kill him thorpe

iv

thorpe was silent for a time trying
to remember arcanes talk to the
henchmen who had ridden out here with
him in search of his body arcane had
said that sarah knew nothing that none
of the emigrants knew his plans and as
he had raked spurs into rangers tender
flanks he had mentioned that something
would happen within a few more days

  something would happen in days that
were vital now for evenings brought their
warning chill of snows to come and wag-
ons that were to make california this year
had to be through emigrant gap ahead of
them

  theres one thing certain he said
slowly bent arcane aint aimin to take
your outfit by way of walker pass you
passed the cut-off to owens valley many
a mile back of carson sink

  thats what a lot of us surmised
sarah burns said its one of the rea-
sons the camp has been so glum and full
of fear but weve had to stick with
arcane because there just wasnt anything
else we could do oh thorpe i-i had
a half-crazy idea when i slipped out of
the camp to come and find you that per-
haps if i was successful we could back-
track and meet jim carrigans train
thorpe looked at her a smile turning

stories

his bruised lips you and me he
grunted are thinkin a lot alike right now
how far back you figure his outfit to be
i dont know the girl hesitated
arcane has pushed us regardless of loss
to our oxen since we parted company
carrigan was always careful to see that
we laid over in good camp-sites every few
days to rest our cattle

  which makes for faster time when you
do catch up and roll the scout said
thoughtfully mebbe he aint more than
two or three days behind mebbe not that
far if were real lucky we might run
into em this side of carson sink

  he stopped right there knowing that if
he said any more hed put fear into the
heart of a girl who had already suffered
enough torment two days three they
might last with the meager food she had
been able to bring but they would need
water and paiute warriors as incon-
spicuous as the darting brown lizards on
the dun earth watched every hole

  thinking of water thorpe reached for
the bag they had both avoided his hand
touched the leather and seemed to freeze
to its flabby surface slowly a little un-
believingly he let his head swing around
and tip down a stunted cactus stubby
enough to pass unnoticed grew in a slight
fold of the wash the earth about it was
dark now and damp

  sarah burns had seen the incredulous
expression that crossed the scouts bruised
face thorpe she scrambled around
him and her small hand snatched the limp
container a few drops of water oozed
lazily from the rent bottom of the bag
like something to love she held the bag
against her breast for an agonized mo-
ment then thorpe saw the caricature of a
brave smile touch her lips

  there theres still a little left she
stammered i-im not thirsty you
drink it thorpe

  no he spoke the word explosively
realizing how the accident had occurred
i must have hit the bag with my hand
when i got up to take a look-see at arcane
and his cronies it landed on the cactus
only a fool like me would have been so
danged careless with something we need
so much now-

  now sarah burns hickory shirt
stirred as she drew a deep breath weve
hells caravan	

got to finu a water-hole and thorpe knew
she was thinking of the paiutes who might
be waiting for them

  he rose with an effort that he tried to
conceal from the girl stiffness was com-
ing to take the place of pain in his battered
body teeth tight against his lip he stum-
bled to the opposite rim of the wash

  behind his back he heard the girl ask
simply how far is it to water

  thorpe calculated swiftly the last
hole where we filled the barrels is nigh on
fifteen miles away he said reluctantly

  the girls thin face cleared why
thats not far well make it by midnight
if we walk three miles an hour

  thorpe felt the stiffness of his muscles
we shore will he said dryly if we can
make three miles an hour

  night covered the salt and the glory of
stars overhead sprinkled the ruts of the
trace with faint radiance under differ-
ent circumstances thorpe knew as they
plodded along he would have considered
the desert beautiful but this night the
story was different every folded wash
and every silhouetted clump of cactus and
sage held potential danger for them

  watching the girl thorpe could see that
each step was becoming more of an effort
and yet she was making a brave attempt to
match his own faltering stride thorpe
figured they had covered ten slow miles
already a few more at the most lay in
front of them he saw the girls face turn
toward him and she gestured at a flat
boulder alongside the trace

  thorpe shook his head weve got to
keep movin he croaked the words pain-
fully stop now and the chill will get in
our bones then we caint walk

  he put his right hand under the girls
elbow to help her a sharper rise than
most in this wide salt desert lay before
them as their leaden feet started to push
them toward its crest sudden remem-
brance came to the scout beyond this ridge
in a thicket of mesquite sage and cactus
lay the spring they were seeking

  weve made it he whispered croak-
ingly to the girl and felt relief make her
sag against him then once again she
straightened sturdily

  but they hadnt made it thorpe
saw that ten minutes later he had

-frontier stories-fall

left sarah below the ridge-line and bellied
his own cautious way up for a look at the
spring beyond

  at first hed thought the dark objects
scattered haphazardly about the mesquite
copse were boulders and then memory
brought its sharp reminder there had
been no piles of stone about the spring two
days before when the arcane caravan had
filled their barrels and watered thirsty
stock

  the objects he was viewing now thorpe
realized with a sinking gauntness in his
stomach were rude brush hogans built by
a band of paiutes they had come here
to gather beans from the mesquite trees
growing about the waterhole he guessed

  there was only one thing they could do
thorpe decided bleakly as he scanned the
camp that was to circle it and put
enough distance between themselves and
the paiutes so that no roving warrior
might locate them

  but first they had to have water that
knowledge was like an unscalable wall fac-
ing them he heard a stir of motion at his
back and sarah burns pressed close along-
side

  you were gone so long i started to
worry she whispered and then her eyes
found the brush huts thorpe felt her
stiffen

  thats the reason he husked

  weve still got to have water- the
girls voice trailed into silence

  and in silence thorpe studied the lay-
out below them gradually one fact be-
came apparent to him all of the huts
faced away from them there was little
that he knew about these desert paiutes
but all the red tribes had their own pe-
culiar superstitions perhaps facing their
hogans toward the rising sun was one na-
tive to these savages

  he pointed the fact out to the girl
mebbe he whispered to her i can get
us some water yet lessn they got a night
guard posted at the spring i can slide
down this way to fill our bag and make it
back without anybody being the wiser

  sarahs stubborn answer came promptly
if you go down there i go with you

  without taking his seeking gaze from
the hogans thorpe nodded the girl
might be safer than here on the ridge
	frontier stories

too it would save the necessity of making
the return climb

  walk light he warned her grimly
and if you know any prayers start sayin
em

  yard by slow yard thorpe led the way
toward the sleeping camp he could feel
the tenseness of the girl beside him but
her nerves were steady enough to keep her
from making any unnecessary sound the
murmur of water spilling from its stone-
lined hollow within the mesquite grove
was audible now it was music the finest
hed ever heard

  the deeper blackness of the stunted mes-
quite trees rose before them thorpe
pressed into the grove and he caught the
vagrant gleam of starshine on a coppery
shoulder

v

the paiutes body twisted and thorpe
threw himself aside sweeping the girl
along with him a flung tomahawk whis-
pered its death song where he had been
standing

  a single outcry or gunshot would rouse
the camp thorpe pressed forward toward
the stocky warrior the long barrel of his
navy colt raking out like a scythe star-
light gleamed on steel in the hand of the
paiute the scout parried the stabbing
blade with the barrel of his colt and let
momentum carry the gun on in and up
he heard breath gush from the indians
mouth as the muzzle of the weapon rose
beneath his chin thorpe struck again with
merciless savagery in a battle like this it
was kill or be killed and the lives of a hun-
dred emigrants might depend on the ac-
curacy of his blow

  the knowledge put power into his
stroke he felt the blue steel of his colt
bite through coarse hair and contact bone
shock ran the length of his arm numbing
his hand and then the paiute came tum-
bling toward him he caught the brave
with arm and upraised knee and the limp-
ness of the mans body as he slid to the
ground told thorpe that here was a coup
he could count if he wanted it

  there would be women wailing in the
paiute camp come morning and there
would be red wolves combing the salt
seeking their revenge this was the thought

in thorpes mind as he stared down som-
berly at the huddled warrior

  he felt sarahs hand on his arm
thorpe her ragged whisper came to
him are you hurt 

  no the scout told her without turning
his head but well both be paiute bait by
morning or before that means weve got
to keep moving and moving fast theres
just about one slim chance for us he
couldnt hide the truth from the girl now
and that is to keep hopin well run into
carrigans train before the paiutes spot us
forget this cuss now weve got to slake
up what water we can and hope the buck-
skin i wadded through that hole in our
waterbag will hold

  nothing had ever tasted better to thorpe
than the clear spring water it was some-
thing to remember as they plodded along
a trace that was like a tawny treadmill
stretching ever before them and grad-
ually the thing he had been dreading hap-
pened he watched the deep blue of the
night sky start to gray and then change to
salmon pink light stole slowly across
the salt and as it came he saw the girls
feet fail to lift she stumbled and only
the quickness of his move saved her a fall
arm around her waist he supported her
sagging weight

  sarah raised a face that silent tears had
streaked thorpe im done she said
huskily i-i cant go on leave me-
laughter that held no mirth touched
thorpes lips you could have left me
before we started he grunted put your
arm around my neck were going to
make that ridge up ahead itll be a right
nice place to watch for paiutes coming
from one direction and carrigans train
coming from the other

  the eastern sky was filled with full dawn
as thorpe helped the girl up the last slant-
ing rise to the ridge and as he peered for-
ward across the dun folds of the salt his
sudden shout made her open eyes that
deadening fatigue had closed

  straight out there before them dawn
light was gilding the stained wagon-tilts
of twenty circled conestogas with golden
glory

  carrigan sarah burns cried jim
carrigan oh thorpe lets hurry

  and i thought you were worn to a
frazzle- he began but he did not finish
hells

the sentence for the girls sudden spurt of
energy had left her he saw her tumble
forward into the road and lie still

that last five hundred yards thorpe
carried the girl alert guards sta-
tioned outside the ring of wagons saw the
duo appear out of the morning and blinked
their eyes the man was over six feet
and his fringed buckskins were ragged and
torn burrs and blood and dirt had mat-
ted the mane of brown hair that swept to
the fringed collar of his tunic but it was
his face they studied most as he drew near
a battered bruised face but it was still
hard and resolute and ready to smile

  this jim carrigans outfit thorpe
looked at the bearded guards and he saw
one of them nod

  right the fust time the man drawled
and then he got a glimpse of the girls
white face cradled against thorpe daniels
chest glory be to goshen the guard
exclaimed iffen it aint miz sarah
burns here let me take her off your
hands my old woman will know just how
to bring her round

  his arms were aching but thorpe said
stiffly without stopping to analyze his rea-
sons ill carry her you lead the way
he followed the guard into the enclosure
and the immediate contrast between this
wagon train and the arcane caravan struck
him

  fat cattle instead of gaunt ones were in-
side a neat rope corral along one curve of
the circle cheerful children were shout-
ing and romping at their first early morn-
ing play bustling women were preparing
food above individual campfires team-
sters and wagoners were looking to their
harness and ox-yokes this was a busy
happy camp quite unlike the gloomy cara-
van the black-haired arcane was leading

  and as though by contrast jim carri-
gan was himself a blond standing almost
six-four in his soft leather boots he was
one of the biggest men the scout had ever
seen above six feet himself thorpe
looked like a stripling alongside the wagon
boss as carrigan saw the new arrivals and
came striding forward

  others were coming too from all sides
it was not often that a caravan received
visitors in the middle of the salt desert

  the excited gabble of voices seemed to

caravan	

be enough to rouse sarah from her faint
the scout felt her stir in his arms and lift
her head put me down thorpe she
said softly i-i can stand now

  hand on his arm for support the girl
had a smile for jim carrigan as he reached
them jim she said simply this is
thorpe daniels if a better scout ever
started for california youll have to show
me

  carrigans sharp blue eyes beneath
bushy brows studied them both and his
answering smile was friendly the hand
he extended to thorpe was like a ham

  thorpe took it with his left the right
he explained aint much good

  it dont have to be any good carrigan
laughed boomingly sarahs stamp on you
is enough for me day or night

  women with heaped plates of steaming
breakfast and mugs of hot coffee were al-
ready about them but hungry as he was
thorpe waved the food away and jerked
his head at carrigan

  the captain understood and followed
him a little distance from the group gath-
ered about sarah burns when they were
out of earshot thorpe paused and waited
for the wagon-master to come up to him

  carrigan he said flatly i was forced
to kill a paiute last night at a spring up
ahead theres quite an encampment about
it gathering mesquite beans for their win-
ter food i guess when they find that
buck theres going to be some hot red-
skins rompin back thisaway my advice
to you is to hole up right here until we see
if theyre willing to attack an outfit this
size

  carrigans bronze face was handsome in
a heavily masculine way he fingered lux-
urious burn sides that dropped to the lobe
of his ear with a hand that looked as if it
had been freshly manicured it made
thorpe aware of two things jim carrigan
was a vain man jealous of his authority as
wagon-master of this train he was also
a stubborn man one who would do things
his own way come hell or damnation

  your advice is good carrigan admit-
ted smoothly but were moving on just
the same ill see that the cavvy-guard is
redoubled and well all keep our eyes
peeled for trouble days mean too much
now to waste a one of them


frontier stories

the paiutes instead of attacking
had vanished by the time the carrigan
train reached the neighborhood of the
spring their huts had been demolished
and even some of their cooking baskets had
been left behind in their withdrawal

  thorpe looked over the wrecked en-
campment from the back of a white riding
mule brought from the cavvy

  it beats me he told carrigan who was
astride a black horse big enough to carry
his weight then his eyes noticed that one
of the huts had been burned to charred
embers mebbe it doesnt beat me so
much at that he added slowly most
reds are a superstitious lot these paiutes
point all their hogans toward the rising
sun mebbe they figgered the spirit of the
buck i killed last night might get into the
hogans and bring em bad luck they
burned one of em just to make sure his
spirit was gone wrecked the rest and
skedaddled

  i take it as a good sign carrigans
lips curled a little disdainfully and im
afraid ill have to tell sarah that perhaps
her judgment of you wasnt so keen after
all a good scout would have thought of
this in advance

  thorpe drew a breath and held his
tongue together after a bountiful break-
fast he and sarah burns had jointly told
jim carrigan of their suspicions concern-
ing bent arcane and carrigan had laughed
at their fears

  arcanes a vain fool he proclaimed
naturally he has no love for me nor i
for him but he isnt the vengeful type
what could he be planning anyway you
say hes ahead of us  all right that means
he has just decided to continue on over
emigrant gap instead of risking his party
on some untried cut-off thats sensible
naturally well keep our eyes peeled for
trouble but i think youre both exagger-
ating

  thorpe had gone to sleep with a bad
taste in his mouth

  and carrigans talk now wasnt improv-
ing it any he was unable to keep the
hardness out of his agate brown eyes as he
stared at the wagon master

  in a new country he said deliberately
a man learns as he goes along if hes
smart this case aint much in point
arcane is the cuss weve got to watch

  the wagons moved on again after bar-
rels banded to their sides were replenished
and the stock watered outrider for the
caravan thorpe had time to think as well
as eye the desert for paiutes as the days
wore on and the more he tried to divine
the plan for revenge that lay in bent
arcanes twisted mind the higher grew the
wall of mystery a few days arcane
had said well three days had passed
and nothing happened

  then a cry winging back to him from
the long snake-like procession roused
thorpe from his contemplation he looked
ahead at the caravan and saw all wagons
halted along the line of march from the
rear wagons men and even women in their
wide skirts were running forward to con-
verge on carrigans lead conestoga

  lips tightening thorpe pressed for-
ward wondering at the cause of the excite-
ment as he passed halted wagons grin-
ning teamsters yelled the good news to
him

  weve hit the emigrant gap turn-off
hooray for california

vi

thorpe felt the words hit him like a
choking fist the emigrant gap
turn-off here from the talk hed heard
in the carson sink camp the turn-off was
many days drive ahead where the whit-
ened skull of an ox set on a pyre of stone
marked the way to california

  yet as he neared the group standing a
few yards in advance of the lead wagon
thorpe could see the monument with the
ox skull on it

  sarah burns was standing beside car-
rigan and she gestured for him to join
them the girls dark eyes were bright
with excitement impulsively she linked
her hand through his arm and thorpe saw
jim carrigans lips tighten

  thorpe sarah cried isnt it wonder-
ful weve reached the turn-off and
every one thought it was days fartfter

        

on-

  the scouts answer came before he could
stifle it i still think so he said flatly

  jim carrigan laughed harshly as
usual he drawled youre wrong youve
got a pair of eyes in your head use them
there is your monument with the ox-skull
hells

on top of it and i presume you can spell
words printed on it they read emi-
grant gap turn-off

  thorpe was using his eyes on more than
that ox-skull this was not the turn-off
he sensed it and yet there was nothing
definite on which he could put his finger
the pyre of small rocks was neatly stacked
the skull was as it should be he disen-
gaged his arm from the girl and silently
turned to move along the wheel-marks of
the side road seeking some sign to prove
his point

  the flanks of the sierras had been close
these last few days never more than ten
miles from the trace thorpes eyes rose
to the towering peaks seven thousand feet
or more above the salt but their inscrut-
able crags couldnt give him the proof he
sought

  and yet they were hitting the turn-off
too soon he thought of arcane and the
deviltry that vengeful man had planned
if this was the trick his brain had con-
ceived every man woman and child in the
carrigan train might perish in the blind
depths of some sierra box-canyon

  there did appear to be a notch between
the folded peaks thorpe noted and from
where he was standing it looked as though
a long canyon led up to it but he had
trapped in the massive rockies and he
knew how easily the appearance of terrain
could change on closer approach

  no there was something wrong here
yet the ruts of the turn-off road stretched
on ahead as far as he could see

  grimly he turned back to the excited
group about the monument and the very
sombemess of his lean visage quieted many
of the caravan folk he stopped in front
of the wagon master and sarah burns

  carrigan he said bluntly in tones
loud enough for all the listening emigrants
to hear sarah and i gave you the infor-
mation we had concerning arcane and what
we knew of the deviltry he planned i
aint sayin this is a part of it but im
askin you to hold the train right here un-
til i can scout this turn-off road and on
along the main trail that takes folks to
oregon i wont be gone more than a
couple of days-

  days days jim carrigans impa-
tient voice cut the scout short thats all
ive heard from you daniels we havent

caravan	

time to waste on your suspicions time is
short weve got to cross the sierras be-
fore snow flies even hours count no
ill give no such permission as long as i
am captain of this train we roll in ten
minutes into the cut-off and you will
oblige me by taking your regular post

on a borrowed mount sarah
bums rode out to the scouts wing
position as the shadows of the long can-
yon closed them in her face wore the
strained look of worry that had been on it
when they had first met

  she came alongside his riding mule and
her hand crossed to touch his arm
thorpe her dark eyes were imploring
i didnt say anything back at the monu-
ment because i hoped that i might be able
to accomplish more by talking to jim
alone but i couldnt he wont listen to
me he just laughs when i mention bent
arcane he-he even laughs at you 
thorpe shook his head men he told
her grimly fall into two classes theres
fools wholl listen and learn and theres
others who have got to butt their heads
against a wall i hate to say it but im
thinkin carrigan is the second kind how-
somever that makes our opinions tally
that night the long wings of the deep
canyon closed them in on either side
sweet water was theirs for the taking from
a brawling stream that filled the canyon
bottom and wagoners buoyed by hope for-
got the days fatigue and went out to bring
in strings of rainbow and mountain trout
to fill the fry-pans of the emigrants

  it was a night for celebration califor-
nia lay over the hill banjos and guitars
made the music for an evening sing ordi-
narily thorpe enjoyed such an occasion
as much as the rest but tonight he found
it hard to carry a tune

  the trace led the train onward the next
day along a high grassy shelf above the
white-water creek jack pine and yellow
pine stippled the slope on their right
snow brush and sumach added their own
glossy green and to men and women who
had seen nothing for a fortnight but the
dun desert this was a fragrant paradise
spirits were high as the day progressed

  as he watched the happiness of every-
one else thorpe felt his own spirits drop-
ping the canyon was rising steadily and
	frontier

growing narrower by the hour ox chains
were groaning more frequently as the great
beasts in their yokes strained dumb power-
ful muscles to obey the shouts of their
masters

  shaking his head thorpe pressed his
mule on ahead the canyon narrowed and
twisted ahead of him but as he rounded a
great buttress of gray granite the way
levelled out ahead here at least thorpe
thought the oxen and mules would have
a chance to rest weary legs he continued
on across the narrow flat the tracks of
the trace were plain through the meadow
grass almost too plain the sudden
thought came to thorpe it looked as
though conestoga wheels had only recently
flattened this grass and yet there were dim
ruts in the earth beneath crushed stems

  its got me beat thorpe muttered the
words aloud he pressed onward through
deep canyon gloom into the gorge beyond
the meadow the shelf he had been fol-
lowing narrowed and started a still steeper
climb the cliffs were high and sheer now
on either side towering a good hundred
feet to pine-crested rims

  behind him he could hear the caravan
creaking into the meadow they had just
quit carrigan was pushing the wagons
he thought they were making good time
despite the steepness of the road

  pressing on he rounded another bend
in the narrowing canyon and then sud-
denly the gorge straightened like a rifle
barrel in front of him three hundred
yards away lay the end of it

  a cliff towering sheer for a thousand
feet boxed the end of the canyon and
at the bottom of it stood the skeleton hulks
of six weathered conestogas

for the space of a minute sur-
prise held the scout and the crazy
thought came to him that this was what
remained of bent arcanes caravan then
he drove his heels into the flanks of the
white mule the true picture of what he
was seeing apparent to him at least the
wagons at the end of the box canyon had
passed through one winter crushed tilts
and warped sideboards was proof enough
of what the weight of snow had done to
them

  other wagons had been turned around
here in this boxed end of the canyon re-

stories

cently bent grass held the marks plainly
and at last thorpe saw the picture clearly
somehow arcane had learned that an ear-
lier party of emigrants had taken this
wrong turn-off and left their tracks upon
the desert cleverly he had pulled out a
half dozen wagons from his own caravan
and brought them into this blind canyon to
freshen up tracks already here then he
had retraced his way to the regular trace
and moved on ahead to join the rest of his
train it had cost him two days time but
the burning vengefulness inside him might
make him consider it worth while to force
the carrigan train into this detour

  however nothing could keep them from
turning back just as arcanes wagons had
done

  the thought was still in his mind when
the funnel of the narrow canyon brought
sound rolling up to him it shocked the
scout like the report of a giant cannon a
rending booming roar that seemed to
shake the mountains and after it came a
duller more sustained roar like the sound
of a heavy waterfall but even that dull
portentous rumble was fading into silence
as thorpe got his frightened mule quieted
and turned back the way he had come

  he forced the animal to a gallop but
the numb knowledge was spreading
through him now that there was no need
for hurry no need at all they wouldnt
be going back to the salt no not a one
of carrigans twenty wagons with their
load of human freight black powder
touched off by bent arcane had kicked a
thousand tons of granite from the walls of
the gdrge granite enough to block any
escape from this box canyon

  it was as bad as he had guessed thorpe
saw as the white mule carried him back to
the narrow meadow dust still drifted lazily
upward from ragged monoliths the size of
a house a great ragged scar lay where
the high granite buttress had been before

  and on the rim a figure made diminu-
tive by distance sat regarding his handi-
work aboard the saddle on a clean-limbed
gelding thorpe recognized both ranger
and bent arcane

  none of the stunned emigrants in this
death canyon had so much as looked up
yet to catch their sight of the man who
had drawn them into this trap but that
was not arcanes pleasure his vengeful
hells caravan	

shout came ringing down into the depths
of the canyon

  let carrigan laugh his way out of
this- he cried

  the steel of his long rifle cradled across
the bows of his saddle felt cold against
thorpes palms he lifted the weapon al-
most without conscious thought as he
brought the mule to a halt steady in his
seat he swung the rifle to his shoulder and
the sights seemed to line themselves with
automatic ease upon the figure on the rim
the wind was bad and arcane was beyond
decent range but there was a good charge
of powder behind the ball in the barrel of
his rifle thorpe caught his ranger horse
across the sights and raised his aim
slightly his finger as he squeezed the
trigger was cold as the granite that
blocked their path of escape

vii

the rifles report rang sharply through
the canyons silence and thorpe saw
that distant shape on the rim stiffen in
rangers saddle arcane seemed to sway
as he wheeled the horse then he dis-
appeared into the cloaking blanket of pines
that mantled the high slope

  like the knock of doom on the door
the sound of his rifle seemed to rouse the
stunned caravan folk for as he lowered
the weapon slowly thorpe heard the
shocked shouts of men who had been gay
but an hour before he heard the cries of
women and the sobbing of children

  sarah burns slim and straight as a
paiute arrow in her mans trousers and
open-necked shirt came racing toward
him as he paced slowly nearer the dis-
ordered train thorpe swung down from
the mule as the girl neared him a queer
glow of happiness that he could not ana-
lyze flowing through his body

  thorpe i think you hit him i she cried
and her body seemed to seek his as she
pressed against him he felt her tremble
and he wanted to hold her but instead he
pressed the girl back there were hostile
eyes watching them he could guess and
this was no time to create dissension he
and carrigan and all the rest were going
to have to pull together in the same yoke
now

across the girls shoulder thorpe saw

jim carrigan break from the huddle of
emigrants about the wagons and stride
slowly toward them braced for trouble
with the wagon boss he was surprised at
carrigans appearance as the man stopped
before them his bronzed face had turned
gray as the granite barrier blocking them
into this death canyon his blue eyes were
clouded with misery

  daniels he said raggedly ive been
a fool for not listening to you a damned
fool but i wont be one any longer im
turning my authority as train captain over
to you

  thorpe thought fast for a minute it
took a good man to admit error if he
accepted carrigans offer the blond giant
wouldnt be worth a damn from here on
in carrigans cqurage and ready laugh to
bolster the morale of other frightened peo-
ple meant more than anything else right
now

  studying the caravan leader thorpe
said shortly i wouldnt take your com-
mand on a platter mister youve had guts
enough to bring a train close to three thou-
sand miles git back there and give those
folks a grin a glum face aint goin to get
us out of this jackpot were in it to-
gether and well lick it together you
tell em that

  a deep breath stirred the wagon-mas-
ters axe-handle-wide chest he put his
hand forward to the scout daniels he
said simply youre a better man than me
mebbe ill be giving orders to the rest of
the company from now on but ill be
takin mine from you

  from the tail end of the caravan nearest
the fantastic slide a voice cried thin and
full of fear the creeks rising its
dammed up well drown like rats in here
thorpe felt a grim surge of power vi-
brate through him he had felt the secret
well of strength open inside his body be-
fore when situations had looked hopeless
and none had ever looked more hopeless
than this his eyes were burning brown
orbs as he glanced down at sarah burns

go tell that fool he snapped that
nobody is going to drown we can pull
our wagons into the boxed end of the
canyon above the slide line if we have to
he watched the girl hurry away as car-
rigan said somberly daniels if were
forced to do that not a one of us will ever
	frontier

leave this canyon alive the snows arent
far away and we havent provisions
enough to last out a month

  thorpe knew that as well as the wagon-
master the thought of the snows to come
was like a weight in his own mind a
memory picture of those pitiful shells of
once proud conestogas at the inner end of
this box canyon came before his eyes
that was what the carrigan train would
look like next spring if winter caught
them here

  theres six wagons at the end of this
canyon he spoke almost to himself and
they were fools for ever havin driven that
far in the cliffs back there are a thou-
sand feet high here his brown eyes
lifted thoughtfully to the western wall of
the gorge they aint over a hundred
theres enough slant to em sos a man
might climb to the rim

  but women and children and stock
could never make it carrigan said
hoarsely daniels with that water rising
weve got to do something and do it quick
if were pushed back were lost

  thorpe nodded he studied the western
escarpment again then turned his eyes
down-canyon already the brawling stream
had widened perceptibly by morning or
before this meadow would be awash

  weve got tonight he muttered the
words to himself and then his eyes sparked
as they found the captain carrigan god
helping us theres a way we can get out
of here-women wagons stock and all
the leaders tense face showed surprise
how-

  ropes thorpe said every wagon
has got rope in it light or strong it dont
matter well use each for what itll hold
if its long enough to stretch to the rim
come runnin mister this is somethin for
everybody to hear

  five minutes later thorpe was staring
into a sea of anxious faces but he wasnt
seeing them he was seeing the plan for
their salvation unfolding in his mind

  were going over the rim he told
them crisply arcane cant whip us if
every one of you works out the night
theres a job for each im leaving the
organizing of crews to you carrigan well
need men to cut wood for bonfires and
women to keep the blazes going to give us
light bulldoggers to hogtie oxen and

stories

  mules ill need ten of the toughest on
top with me to haul up the wagons and
supplies as theyre hitched into the slings
down here some of you get to dismantling
the wagons right now and some of you
women start cookin up grub were go-
ing to need hot food and coffee to keep
this job going but we can swing it

  swing it or go down fighting carri-
gan shouted and his booming infectious
laugh was like a pledge that no man or
woman would die here in this boxed canyon
of death

fires at top and bottom burned
the short night hours away logs set
to keep ropes from chafing had long since
been worn smooth pulleys howled as
men bent their backs to raise heavy cone-
stoga wheels and the bulky boxes of
wagons it was a fantastic task a red
nightmare fought against creeping time
thorpe found himself everywhere a thou-
sand details needing his attention and
ever below them as he peered downward
was the widening black mirror of that
rising stream

  the red stars wheeled overhead and
the night wind had a frosty bite as it
came sweeping down from timbered heights
thorpe had ordered each wagon and its
load of supplies bunched to simplify the
process of assembling them in the morn-
ing ten were up when rising water
snuffed one of the great bonfires lighting
the meadow below thorpe saw the flames
dwindle like a giant candle burning to the
end of its wick

  poised on the rim he sent his harsh
voice winging down to those fighting folk
in the meadow abandon the rest of
the wagons he ordered get up a few
more slings of food and clothes shoot
the stock we havent saved then make
ready to ride the slings yourselves

  somberly he regarded the death can-
yon below in some far-off camp on the
true trail to emigrant gap bent arcane
would be chuckling

  weary to the point of numbness thorpe
still could not rest as he saw other dead-
tired emigrants sprawl on the brown needles
beneath the pines not one of the com-
pany had been lost a few had been
scratched and bruised on the haul up the
cliff but that was all ten wagons had
hells caravan	

been abandoned on the morrow trout
would be swimming through their tilts

  one shape stirred beneath the pines
sarah burns had seen the lonesome shape
of the scout standing beside the heaped
coals of one of the bonfires a blanket
in her arms she came toward him

  thorpe her voice was gentle put
this around you and lay down you cant
keep going forever--and-and well need
you more tomorrow than we do now
thorpe felt her words drain the last
strength from him and somehow or other
he found himself on the warm earth be-
side the coals and the girls gentle hands
were covering him with the blanket a
club over the head could have put him
to sleep no more quickly

  dawn and its problems came before
the scout realized that he had been asleep
he met carrigan at the breakfast fire
when women prepared a community meal
and drew the captain aside

  jim he said soberly weve each got
a job yours is to get the wagons and
company assembled ill tackle the job
of scouting a route for us were too
high now to try to backtrack to the salt
so weve got to push ahead ive got
two ideas on that score if we cut across
country to the west were bound to hit
the emigrant gap road sooner or late that
means tough travel and days mebbe even
weeks of it might be well hit canyons
where well have to dismantle and lower
the wagons haul em up the other side
like weve done here that takes time
and your other plan  carrigan
asked

  just this thorpe said bluntly a
trapper and scout learns to gamble im
ready to believe we can climb this ridge
to the gap i spotted yesterday wont
likely have any canyons to cross but the
going may be rough when we hit the
summit well try and work west to the
emigrant gap road

  either way were gambling jim car-
rigan said slowly ill take the big one
with you start blazin your trail mister

a cold wind that brought its def-
inite threat of winter whipped thorpe
as the white mule ginger carried him
upward between the aisle of giant pines
short axe gripped in his left hand he

made his slow way up the ridge estimating
the distance between trees seeking the
easiest path for the giant conestogas to
follow for a thousand feet the trail was
open then a tangle of windfall trees
like a gigantic pile of jack-straws blocked
his progress lips set the scout detoured
to the left here the slope grew danger-
ously slant but with ropes caught to wagon
boxes and snubbed about trees the wagons
could be held and inched on forward
for forward they must go with no time
spent on roadbuilding if it could possibly
be avoided

  once when he broke into a high moun-
tain meadow he could glimpse the peaks
high above the toiling wagons that would
be following the blazes he had left on
trees wreathing those implacable iron
crests was a gray scud of clouds at
the sight he clenched his fists he felt
like shaking them at the heights but that
would do no good snow was an enemy
that man couldnt whip with his fists speed
was the only thing that would aid them
now fleetingly thorpe thought of bent
arcane and his gloom caravan westward
on the emigrant gap road

  then he forced his attention back to the
task at hand after that it was twist and
turn and climb blaze trees and climb again
mid-afternoon came and the ridge tipped
suddenly forward into a level-floored
canyon

  the gap thorpe spoke the words
aloud and the crying of the wind in the
pines on either flank mocked him it was
time to turn back but he had to see what
lay beyond this deep v between the high-
flying peaks the mule was game for the
run thick meadow grass thorpe saw
as he rode would make fine graze for
gaunted cattle and mules for a mile
straight between the cloud-wreathed peaks
above he followed the meadow and then
the gap widened as the mountains curved
back on either side into a wide plateau
a plateau that stretched westward for as
far as he could see

  thorpe relaxed with a sigh of relief
arcane had led them into a death trap
but sweat and toil had saved every life
and part of the wagons arcane had led
them into a death trap and from his venge-
fulness had come this pathway to salva-
tion
	frontier

the twinkle of burning campfires led
the scout back to the wagon camp
long after chill dark had closed in the
mountains

  joy at the report he had to make to the
assembled company supplanted the stunned
gloom of the previous day im not say-
ing it will all be clear sledding he fin-
ished bluntly but weve got a good chance
of following that plateau until we strike
the emigrant gap road i figger it will
take us leastways three days more to
make it to the pass i found through the
peaks how far well have to travel the
plateau after that is anybodys guess

  thorpe made no mention of the snow
clouds he had seen wreathing the high
peaks there was no use rousing fear in
these people they had suffered enough
already and happiness and anticipation
he knew would keep a man going longer
than the spur of fear

  three days he had judged it would
take them to reach the pass above instead
it consumed six six days that saw an-
other wagon abandoned when animals
grown gaunt from insufficient feed were
unable to pull the conestoga a foot farther

  well use the yoke for replacements
thorpe told carrigan mebbe the big
fellas will get some meat on their bones
without a wagon to pull

  strain was showing on every one now
and thorpe saw eyes turn anxious when-
ever their faces lifted toward the sky
it was the tail of the sixth day when the
train leveled into the pass cattle so
gaunt their bones were almost breaking the
skin halted in their tracks and attacked
the fresh grass

  camp was made right there and spirits
climbed that night as someone brought
forth a banjo for sarah burns to play
oh susanna was the popular song
for california was just over the hill

  danged if you caint almost smell that
yaller gold out yonder one emigrant
chuckled

  aside where they could converse with-
out interruption thorpe talked earnestly
to the wagon-master the cattle and
mules are about done in jim we may
not like it but weve got to lay over here
a couple of days and give them some rest
or we may never make the emigrant gap
road

stories

  carrigan nodded his blond head yes
the giant agreed i had the same thought
something struck the wagon-masters hand
then

  thorpe saw carrigans eyes tip down
and through the gloom he spotted the
faintest fleck of white against the others
brown skin something cool and feathery
brushed his own cheek in the same instant
and then both men looked up to stare long
and soberly at each other

  over at the camp-fire thorpe heard
voices break abruptly from the song they
were singing snow someone cried

men and women were starting
to their feet in something close to
panic the scouts long legs carried him
into the firelit circle hold up he spoke
to them sharply there aint no cause
for alarm if you keep your heads weve
come too far to let a little snow stop us
now but theres things to be done the rest
of tonight besides sing every pound of
weight in the wagons that aint essential
has got to go that means everything but
food and blankets cleanin out the cones-
togas is up to you women as for the
rest of us we got a chore to do boys
men yore captain figgered to lay over
here and fatten the teams for a couple of
days if snows cornin we cant do it
yet we got to keep our oxen and mules fed
just the same so get out your knives and
start cutting grass pack the wagons with
every danged ounce theyll hold keep
our stock strong and well pull through
starve em and well starve too

  cold came with the morning and the
snow was inches deep as protesting oxen
broke the wagons into motion again the
white blanket crackled beneath iron-tired
wheels leaving a lacy pattern behind the
moving conestogas

  cheeks flushed with cold sarah rode
in the lead with thorpe to help search
out the smoothest path for the wagons to
follow he was glad for her company
thered been little chance to be alone these
last few days and yet when it came to
talking to the girl he found himself
strangely tongue-tied

  if this chill holds thorpe told her
a little gruffly we wont get any more
snow but if it warms up look out for
trouble
hells caravan	

  sarah nodded her lips were chapped
but she could still smile then the smile
faded i keep thinking of mother she
murmured and all the rest of them i
wonder where they are now  has the
snow been worse farther west or have
they managed to beat it over the hump
i-i suppose well never know until we
reach the lowlands and hangtown

  theres just one thing certain thorpe
told her grimly arcane will get them
over the hump if he can hes had his
revenge he figgers us for goners so
you can bet your dollar that hell pull his
own outfit through if he can

  we-we might even meet on the road
down sarah said

  thorpe gave her a cool straight glance
i would like nothing better he told her
quietly

  for three days as they rolled slowly
west along the plateau the cold held while
clouds kept massing in the sky their
grayness was like an oppressive weight and
desperation was driving them all now

  thorpe offered to go on ahead to try to
cut the gap road but jim carrigan vetoed
the plan we lose you daniels and none
of us will make it if a storm breaks
while youre gone youd never find your
way back no weve got to hang and
rattle together mister

  the fourth day dawned and the air had
a softer warmer feel against the scouts
cheek as he and carrigan saw the wagons
lined out behind their advance

  a sudden thought came to thorpe
hitch ropes from tongue to tailgate of
each wagon he suggested and another
line from yore lead wagon to the cantles
of our saddles well keep pushin on
snow or no damned snow and we wont
need to worry about wagons gettin lost
or out of line

  the first flurry hit them before the job
was finished looking across his shoulder
through the falling flakes thorpe watched
men and even women struggling to string
ropes between the wagons as they kept
moving by the time carrigan was back
beside him with lines to hitch to their own
saddles even the lead wagon fifty feet
behind them was nothing but a dim blur

  through the muffler wrapped about his
face carrigan howled here it is
daniels

  thorpe nodded without trying to speak
no words were needed each of them
knew that if they didnt reach the descend-
ing gap road before the day was out
they would never make it five feet of
snow would blanket this plateau by morn-
ing and weary oxen could not smash their
way through drifts that high

  only the lines strung between the wagons
were keeping some from straying now
thorpe knew as he and carrigan paced
blindly forward into the teeth of the bliz-
zard the feel of wind and snow against
his face guided thorpe for an hour
he kept the gusts coming from a quarter-
ing direction and that meant he was still
headed in a straight line forward

  the mule stumbled beneath him then
tipped forward they were at the head of
a sharp declivity pines reared like white
ghosts on either side suddenly and thorpe
gritted his teeth at a nod from carrigan
and let the wagons come on

  a man couldnt tell what lay at the bot-
tom of this slope perhaps a canyon bot-
tomless for a thousand feet and perhaps
-it was a grim guess-the gap road they
sought might lie just ahead

  as though his thoughts had conjured
a picture thorpe saw something loom out
of the driving curtain ahead it looked
like the high ghostly tilt of a prairie
schooner and then it was gone in the scud
but another seemed to take its place and
he knew that he couldnt be mistaken a
second time for they were close enough
now for sound to reach them flying
toward them on the howling blizzard wind
thorpe heard the rattle of ox-chains the
groaning of loose fellowes in wagon
wheels-

  mittened hand brushing back to his hip
he got his knife from beneath the heavy
coat an emigrant had loaned him he
slashed the rope binding him to the lead
wagon behind them and plunged ahead

  he heard carrigan cry something that
sounded like arcane

arcane yes this could be arcanes
caravan traveling the emigrant road
breath suddenly hot in his chest thorpe
dropped the mule into the roadway navy
colt in hand he swung the animals head
up-hill as another conestoga lurched into
view
	frontier

  lifting his gun he fired a single shot
into the sky for it was about the only sound
a half-blinded driver would hear and com-
prehend he saw plodding mules halt as
the reinsman on the box drew in thorpe
pressed alongside the wagon hold er
he shouted against the force of the wind
theres an outfit cornin in from the
side-

  and who might be their captain
he heard the question thinly through the
crying of the wind

  jim carrigan thorpe answered the
driver

  glory be the shout that answered
him was louder you couldnt name a
better man to me nor plenty of the rest
bent arcanes been spreadin it around for
the last week that carrigans outfit wouldnt
be seein californy this year-

  mebbe thorpe didnt speak the words
very loudly but they seemed to carry to
the driver above him arcane is the one
who wont be seeing the sacramento

  if youre that pilgrim he tromped ill
lay my bets on you sarah burns musta
found ye and together yuh tied in with
carrigan her mother will be mighty glad
to hear that

  we did thorpe said wheres
arcane 

  up ahead the driver chuckled ill
hold the rest back till your caravan sand-
wiches intuh line if you want to make a
ride

  thorpe turned the mule without more
words and the wind at his back seemed to
blow him forward he thought fleetingly
of sarah burns and jim carrigan the
captain had turned into a mighty decent
man hed have plenty to offer an argo-
naut girl beside the dream of a rancho
looking out to the sea and the caravan
itself was safe now on this downhill
grade they could bull through drifts that
would halt a wagon on the level yes
the combined trains could make the low-
lands now even through the howling scud
of blizzard snow

  he was thinking about that when a
tall muffled shape on a bay horse that
had clean familiar lines loomed out of
the whiteness before him he recognized
ranger before he identified its rider

  then bent arcanes imperious voice

 stories

came at him what in damnation is
holding up the rear wagons

  i am thorpe said the words quietly
and his face was recognizable as the muf-
fler slipped down to his throat

  arcanes eyes through their rime of
frost were startled but the man was quick
to recover with a movement swift as
the strike of a snake he flipped a long
knife from the sleeve of his big coat
thorpe saw the glint of it and heard the
mans howled words i didnt finish my
job once i will this time

  without mercy or regret thorpe trig-
gered the colt in his left hand arcane
had been full of treachery from the begin-
ning he would never change thorpe
saw his lead catch the man full in the
chest and the knife half-back for throw-
ing never left the caravan leaders hand
the scout watched the blade drop from
opening fingers and then arcanes body
was slumping across rangers saddle

  thorpe swung forward to steady the
man and he knew that the limp shape
under his hand was dead even as he
touched him the somber thought came
to the scout that morning would find an-
other unmarked and lonesome grave on the
road to california

  they buried bent arcane that night
below the white belt where the blizzard
still howled and jim carrigan pronounced
the last somber ritual

  dust thou art to dust returneth -
friends he added soberly i cannot find
it in my heart to say more either for
or against this man

  thorpe was conscious of sarah beside
him and he felt the quick tension of her
fingers against his palm as carrigan fin-
ished speaking lets walk she whis-
pered

  and thorpe with shy diffidence asked
a question that had to be answered before
they reached the sacramento mebbe
youd rather wait for jim

  sarah burns eyes lifted to the scouts
sober face you may she said acidly
know a lot about traps and mountains
but you dont know much about women
thorpe walked with the argonaut girl
and he knew in his heart that he had found
the thing he wanted these long wandering
years-

lone bandit

by john vernon daley

henry starr leader of the no-
torious band of outlaws that oper-
ated along the kansas and indian
territory border in the year of  lay
wounded at his ranch over by the cherokee
indian reservation

  i also a member of the gang slightly
wounded and badly wanted was in hiding
at the town of muskogee indian territory

  one day i received word from henry
asking me to see him first chance i got
two days later disguised as an indian i
rode down the familiar lane that led to his
large ranch house dismounting and with
my cane to aid me i hobbled across the
lawn to the great iron-studded door
rapped on it with my cane and waited
expectantly

  the door was opened by his house-
keeper a half-breed indian squaw called
the black pearl at first glance she failed
to recognize me but when i spoke to her
she bade me welcome anticipating my
inquiry for henry she told me he was in
his room asleep that at her request the
doctor from the reservation had come over
and after dressing his wound had given
him a sleeping potion 

  henry she told me was not in a serious
condition but had taken no care of him-
self having been on the go constantly try-
ing to straighten out his affairs a slight
infection of the bullet wound in his side
had sent him to bed the doctor said he
needed rest

  henry was known to be a close friend of


	frontier

cherokee bill killed in a recent train rob-
bery it was known too that henry had
had business relations with dick dine and
eddie estelle who was arrested for the
crime and was under suspicion by the
united states marshals office for com-
plicity in the affair

  pearl who was raised by the starrs
and loyal to the core said they cant
get anything on him no one dares to
testify against him the whole cherokee
nation is worked up over the killing of
bill they are all henrys friends so
is the indian agent he told the marshal
to take it easy and not to start nothing
and i am telling you that if they try to
arrest henry starr there is going to be
plenty killings do you know what they
are trying to do trying to break henrys
lease and that crooked banker at cherry-
vale wont advance him any more money

  i had found out that if henry failed to
have twelve thousand dollars to pay the
indian agent for an extension of his lease
in a months time they were going to eject
him from his vast holdings

  i went up to his room quietly and stood
at the foot of his bed with my eyes resting
on him in sober thought this man was
my loyal friend he had saved my life on
two occasions at the risk of his own it
was now up to me to show my friendship
and worth other than in words fearful
that i might awaken him i slipped away
pearl was making up my room and i told
her i had business that would take me
away for a few days and for her to tell
henry that i would have good news for
him on my return

  i had thought of a way to help him a
desperate plan but dangers and hard-
ships hadnt daunted me and the bullet
wound in my hip made me only slightly
lame maybe it was a foolish thing to do
but under the circumstances i didnt think
so my friend was sick and in trouble
and i wouldnt let risk to my skin stand
in my way of helping him

out at the corral i roped and threw
the saddle on a big roan mare
mounted and headed for cherry vale kan-
sas i had ninety miles of wild unknown
and heavily timbered country before me
with renegade indian gunmen as well as
lawmen seeking my life but my mind

stories

was made up there would be no turning

back now

  mile after mile of new territory drifted
behind the flying hoofs of my big mare
the going so far was good i was follow-
ing a wide cattle trail there was no ne-
cessity for haste and when i concluded i
had covered one third of the distance i
found a likely spot and made camp after
i had watered and staked the roan in a
grassy spot i built a fire between two logs
as it was september and the nights were
beginning to grow cold

  i had only a handful of parched corn
and a few pieces of jerk in my saddle bags
as i had made no preparation for this
journey the decision to rob the bank of
cherry vale was made on the spur of the
moment

  after eating my food i spent some time
around the fire finally growing sleepy
i went back a short distance in the brush
and raked a pile of leaves together for a
bed and went instantly to sleep

  i slept soundly but with that hair-trig-
ger lightness of a man to whom danger is
no stranger suddenly i snapped awake
and lay tensely alert hand gripping my
gunbutt it was early morning the smell
of pine was in the crisp air my ears still
rang with a slight sound it was still dark
that darkness that comes before dawn
the fire was still smoldering and by its
dim light i saw a man limp into sight
carrying a rifle

  he was dressed in buckskins and his
long iron gray beard matched his hair that
hung to his shoulders although i could
see that he knew my gun covered him he
came toward me with confidence dont
get scared sonny he said old gable
aint going to hurt you

  without another word he started cook-
ing on the fire boiling coffee and frying
bacon and baking hot cakes

  i was only eighteen years of age and
the smell of the fragrant coffee and frying
bacon whiffed to me on that crisp air was
overwhelming

  having finished his cooking he said
dont be backwards sonny toddle up
and help yourself if you had lived as
long as i have in the indian country you
would know that i am not curious or in-
quisitive you are welcome sonny come
on up
tom

  instinctively i liked that old bearded
man and could see no harm in him so i
accepted his invitation and stepped over
to the fire he handed me a can of coffee
and invited me to help myself to the hot
cakes and bacon as i stooped and reached
for them with my free hand he kicked the
fire and ashes into my face i was but a
moment off guard but his action was
swift in a flashing blur of motion his
hand swooped to his holster and came up
blasting one bullet burned a red smear
along my cheek while the other nipped the
collar of my jacket

  i should have killed him but i pulled
off and shot him high in the shoulder
dazed he staggered backwards tripped
and fell he was a wretched coward
groveling and begging for his life it was
but a slight wound i ripped open his
jacket and staunched the blood

  i didnt ask him why he tried to kill me
but he told me his name was gable he
had been to cherryvale for supplies and
had seen the posters giving a good descrip-
tion of me and offering the large reward
for my apprehension or death when i
limped toward the fire and came close
enough for him to see my blue eyes he
recognized me in spite of my disguise

  he was the type of outlaw that was
hated above all others in the territory
selling guns ammunition and whiskey to
the indians

  after bandaging his wound i followed
him to where he had his outfit after a
few grunts and groans he mounted his
swayback sorrel mare and taking the lead-
line of his pack mule was off without the
customary farewell

  overanxious to be on his way he forgot
to take his cooking utensils and food and
although greatly worried i made a hearty
meal his treacherous attempt on my life
coupled with the fact that he had recog-
nized me so readily made my task doubly
hard besides i knew that this part of the
territory was infested by bounty-hunting
outlaws and indians

  the sun was peeping above the tree tops
when i mounted and sped swiftly along
the trail straining my eyes and ears to hear
or see the unusual hills covered with a
dense growth of timber and undergrowth
canyons so choked with brush and tangled
drift that their bottoms never saw sun-

bandit	

light were before me the only sound
that reached my ear was the slight jingle
of the gear on the impatient roan

  hours passed the afternoon shadows
lengthened near the border were a few
open spaces these i crossed with mis-
givings the big roan had flung miles be-
hind her seemingly without effort

  the sun was low in the west when i
approached the small clearing surrounded
with cottonwood trees in which the town
of cherryvale was hidden deciding that
boldness was the best method i rode down
the main street

i came to the feed-lot dismounting
i led the roan in and requested the
indian in charge to give her water grain
and a rubdown

  the town was quiet as i made my way
up the street to the nearest saloon only
a few saddle horses and a couple of wag-
ons showed in the street and not more
than a half a dozen men were in sight my
entrance was opportune as i was the only
customer the bartender was a cherokee
indian and i spoke to him in the dialect
how about a drink of whiskey i asked
him placing a bottle and glass on the bar
he said help yourself kid youre white
and twenty-one or i am blind

  i was startled but his broad wink as-
sured me as no customers arrived i
bought several drinks and at my request
he joined me i told him i had some ur-
gent business to transact with the banker
but as i had arrived after banking hours
it would be necessary for me to locate his
residence and asked him for information
as to its whereabouts he told me that
the banker was out of town but that his
brother who was the cashier and lived
with him would no doubt be able to serve
me beckoning me he went to the door
and pointed to a house several doors from
the bank and said that it was the bankers
residence after buying a final drink i
bade him good night and left

  back again on the street i found that
the town had begun to come to life horses
were hitched along the rails and several
men were standing in front of the saloon
across the way my entrance to the town
had been timely i had met with far more
success than i had dared hope fori

  having no further business to detain
	frontier

me i headed for the feed-lot keeping in
the shadows reaching it i led out the
roan mounted and headed out of town
about a mile from town i found a place
some yards off the trail where the brush
was thick enough to conceal the roan dis-
mounting i removed both saddle and
bridle and staked her out

  my un familiarity with the trails in that
thickly wooded part of the territory
which i would be compelled to travel
caused me to postpone robbing the bank
until the early hours of morning it was
barely twelve miles to the border and i
was banking my chances on the swiftness
and endurance of my mount i had little
fear of being pursued across the line by
a posse there was small chance of them
trying to explore the gloomy canyons and
thickly wooded hills daring lawmen and
greedy grasping reward seekers had been
known to enter on the trail of badly
wanted fugitives - and never return
others had returned tied to their saddles
dead

  i figured that i had about five hours to
wait so i found a nook and stretched out
to take a nap i wasnt going to spend it
worrying about something ahead

  two hours before dawn i saddled the
roan and headed back to cherryvale
when i arrived i found the streets empty
the town slumbered tying the roan to
a large cottonwood tree in front of the
bank i strolled down the street to the
bankers house and knocked loudly on the
door

  the man who opened it had appar-
ently been in haste as he was pulling
his trousers on over his nightshirt when
he started asking me my business i shoul-
dered in without ceremony he took a
step backwards and his face went ashen
what-is-the-meaning-of-this  he
stammered

  pressing my gun against his breast i
told him not another word out of you
fellow grasping him by the arm i
pulled him through the doorway and
gently closed the door

  he seemed to know what it was all
about as he headed for the bank without
being told he unlocked the bank door
and stepped hastily within the watch-
man on whom he may have depended and
who slept on a bunk in the rear of the

 stories

bank sat up sleepily rubbing his eyes
catching sight of the gun in my hand his
hand slid under the pillow and came out
furtively grasping a gun i fired instantly
and it disappeared from his hand he sat
staring with stupefaction at his bleeding
fingers

  afraid that my shot would attract atten-
tion i prodded the horror-stricken cashier
with the still smoking gun and demanded
that he open the safe quickly if he wished
to live

  he was trembling to the extent he could
hardly grasp the knob however he
opened it readily i pitched him the sad-
dlebags and told him to fill them with
paper money only

  the watchman still sat on the bunk
nursing his wounded hand and the cashier
was hastily stuffing the saddlebags with
currency when i heard faint and far
away the sound of running feet snatch-
ing the bags from the cashier i backed to
the door keeping them both covered
opening it i ran swiftly across the walk
to where i had tied the roan quickly un-
hitched her and mounted

  i was not a moment too soon as i was
quickly surrounded by a bunch of town-
men who stood gaping staring in amaze-
ment

  then one of them a hawkish-faced fel-
low with a crooked gash of a mouth
pushed himself to the front and stood
glowering i felt his challenge his bel-
ligerence a hush of expectancy fell over
the crowd i was tensed for action but
wholly unprepared for what followed

shooting from his hip he fired
point-blank at me without warning
the bullet cut my hat brim but before he
could fire again i sent three bullets thud-
ding into his body as he fell i emptied
my gun over the startled crowd and
wheeling my mount and uttering the shrill
cherokee cry of victory dashed back to-
ward the territory

  the townies recovering from their con-
fusion sent several badly aimed bullets in
my direction but the big roan was cover-
ing the ground with mighty leaps reach-
ing the heavy timber and underbrush she
plunged through without faltering

   i could see no trail as it was still dark
owing to the swiftness of my noble roan
lone

and luck at the bank i had made far
greater speed than i had reckoned i
wasnt worried as i knew the general di-
rection of the cherokee reservation i
headed her in that direction and gave her a
slack rein to allow her to pick her way
around the close standing trees

  coming into a small clearing i halted
her dismounted and eagerly looked over
my haul the stamped parcels were easily
counted i had robbed the cattlemans
bank of cherryvale of twenty-two thou-
sand dollars a far greater sum than i had
reckoned i was jubilant not for myself
but due to the fact that my friend wouldnt
have to give up his holdings for the want
of ready cash

  all that day i traveled slowly through
the dense timber i was searching for the
cattle trail so far without success how
far i had traveled toward my destination
i had no idea when darkness came it be-
gan to rain thunder rolled heavily against
the cliffs and rolled down into the valley
and black canyons when it was too dark
to travel further i found a declivity lead-
ing into a canyon and in its desolate se-
clusion spent a quiet night

  next morning when light enough to
travel i saddled the roan mounted and
searched for the slope where i had en-
tered when i located it and ascended to
the rim i saw a log cabin not over a hun-
dred yards distance away smoke was
ascending from the chimney anticipat-
ing a hot meal and information about the
cattle trail i dismounted and tied up the
roan and approached it cautiously but
when i saw nothing to cause alarm i
stepped boldly into the clearing and hailed
when i received no reply to my repeated
hailings i approached the cabin and
knocked loudly on the door with the butt
of my carbine shuffling feet sounded
when i repeated my summons the inside
bar was removed and the door cautiously
opened

  the man who faced me in the doorway
was a breed dressed in buckskins he
was drunk and held a rifle loosely in his
hand easy with that rifle fellow i
said to him in the cherokee dialect

  in his drunken condition he mistook me
for an indian and addressed me in the
same dialect but as he was a chickapee

-frontier stories-fall

bandit	

breed he spoke the words poorly i
thought he was asking me to have a drink

  as he said nothing further but stood
staring at me in a hostile manner i be-
came suspicious of him and was about to
demand the hospitality he should have ac-
corded me without request i placed my
hand on my gunbutt and was about to
speak when i felt the hard muzzle of a
gun jab me in the back and a voice that
sounded like the friction of a file on steel
that said this is the hydrophobia skunk
i was telling you about dick step aside
i am going to blow him apart

  with my hand already on my gunbutt
in swivel holster i instantly tipped it back-
wards and thumbed the hammer with the
rapidity gained from long practice al-
though my shooting was done blindly it
was deadly accurate when i heard him
fall i stepped aside still keeping the breed
covered

  when i had shot his partner i saw him
tense his hand stole toward the hammer
of his gun i thought for a moment that
i would be compelled to kill him also i
commanded him to drop his rifle he not
only dropped it but unbuckled his belt
and let his guns drop

  then i looked at the man i had shot
and was not greatly surprised to find that
he was gable the peddler a great blotch
of blood covered his jacket on his left
breast his moaning had ceased and
even as i looked at him his breath left him
in a slow gasp

  entering the cabin i commanded the
breed to prepare my breakfast and while
he was doing so i questioned him about
the cattle trail he told me that the trail
was only a short distance from the cabin

  after eating i took him with me to
where i had tied the roan and demanded
that he show me the trail when we reached
it i unloaded his guns and gave them to
him after cautioning him not to follow me
i galloped swiftly down the trail glancing
back occasionally to see if i were followed

  i gave the roan a loose rein and allowed
her to travel in leisurely fashion while i
scanned the brush for a likely place to
make camp

  suddenly the roan changed her direction
and headed in a southerly direction along
a narrow trail then straight ahead
through the thick foliage i spied the light
frontier stories



of a fire and heard the terrified bawl of a
frightened steer being seared by a hot iron

  dismounting i removed my spurs and
worked my way through the thick brush
with difficulty when about a hundred
yards from where i had left my mount i
made out a large log corral filled with cat-
tle and by the dim light of a small fire i
could see several human figures it was
too dark to judge accurately but one of
them who sat humped in the saddle of a
large horse looked like henry starr

  my mind was wholly obsessed with the
spectacle before me when a voice spoke to
me from the brush steady kid it
warned keep your hand away from
your gun

  then straight in front of me and not
over ten feet distance away the brush
parted and a man stepped forth with a gun
pointed directly at me he walked up to
within a yard of me and stood grinning
but the set of his jaw and the look in his
eyes boded me no good

  i stood tensed with feet well braced
ready to take advantage of the first oppor-
tunity he gave me the situation looked
hopeless he held his gun with confidence

  he spoke roughly what in the hell
are you up to indian prowling and snoop-
ing around here at this time of the night
i had forgotten my stained face he
thought i was an indian it was better
luck than i had expected i wasnt going
to enlighten him and when i answered i
did so in the cherokee dialect asking if
he were a law officer he shook his head
giving me to understand that he under-
stood none of the dialect i then mixed a
few words of english with cherokee and
told him i had a message for henry starr
he was startled and looked at me search-
ingly and inquired then why are you
sneaking around over here in the brush
henrys ranch is over by the cherokee
reservation

  mumbling a few words of cherokee i
pointed towards the corral he made the
mistake of turning to see what i was
pointing at he was quick to realize his
mistake and whirled quickly but only in
time to look in the muzzle of my guns

  dont move drop your gun fellow
i snapped at him

he was so mad that he had allowed
himself to be tricked that he hesitated and

stood staring at me with bleak murderous
eyes but when i repeated my command
he dropped his rifle and when i had
stripped him of his short guns i asked
him who are your friends that are doing
the branding

  go to hell he shouted and cursed me
for a full minute

  i have a message for henry starr i
told him and if that isnt him over at the
corral i will have to take you with me to
his ranch

  he thought this over for a moment and
said nastily if you want to see henry
hes over at the corral but damn you to
hell if you are lying to me

  if it isnt henry and you are leading
me into a trap i told him earnestly you
had better start saying your prayers now
we started to walk

coming within a short distance of
the corrals my eyes made a quick
survey of the place at the far corner of
the big double corral two white men sat
their mounts surrounded by a dozen in-
dians in the corral close at hand henry
starr was mounted on his big gray stud-
horse and surrounded by a full score of
indians squatting on their haunches
around a small fire and talking in guttural
tones when one of the indians called his
attention to us henry left the corral and
rode forward when he recognized me
and the man i was bringing in on the
point of my gun he laughed outright re-
covering he extended his hand and said
glad to see you johnny i see you know
your way around

  grasping his hand i told him glad to
see you around too chief

  well johnny he remarked i see
that the man you brought in has sneaked
and if you have nothing to detain you we
will be on our way

 we rode along in silence henry
drooped in his saddle seemed in deep
meditation presently he spoke in a
slightly worried tone johnny i let that
fine bunch of steers go for ten dollars a
head stealing cattle isnt very profitable
at that price

  when we reached the home corral which
we did shortly as the distance was only
five miles henry remarked in a joshing
tone come give an account of yourself
lone

youngster you come barging into one of
my strongest cattle hideouts bringing my
lookout in on the point of your gun what
have you been up to since you visited me 
tossing him the saddlebags which i
was carrying across my arm i told him
proudly i had a little job in view chief
and not seeing any of the gang around
i did it myself

  looking into the bags he saw the pack-
ages of currency and inquired how
much and from where-if it is a fair
question

  i told him that i had robbed the bank
at cherryvale kansas of twenty-two thou-
sand dollars he seemed surprised and
inquired did i understand you to say
you robbed the cattlemans bank of
cherryvale 

  when i informed him that he had not
misunderstood me he looked at me with
eyes that danced with laughter and i heard
him mumble and he brought the old
wolfs cub in on the point of his gun too
he questioned me no further but re-
marked you must be hungry johnny
lets see what pearl has ready for us
when we entered the house the food
was on the table waiting pearl had been
informed by the indians of our coming
long before our arrival

  seated in the sittingroom after a hearty
meal i told henry of my adventure how
i was compelled to kill the townsman and
peddler

  henry made no comments but inquired
what do you intend to do with the
money 

  i told him that my sole object in rob-
bing the bank was to obtain money for him
to pay for an extension of his holdings

  that is mighty fine of you he said
sincerely but i cant accept your money
as a gift i am having a tough time lately
and need money badly so will make you a
proposition my horse herd numbers over
three hundred head i will give you a bill
of sale on the half of them for fifteen
thousand dollars

  knowing how justly proud henry was
of his fine horse herd and glad to have
him accept the money under any condi-
tions i gladly accepted

  henry looked drawn haggard and
heavy-eyed as he sat counting out the

bandit	

money i want you to know johnny
he said that i sure appreciate having this
money and the source it came from gives
me more pleasure did you happen to
notice two men seated on their horses at
the other end of the corrals they were
tom morrow and his partner bill doolin
tom and bill came into the territory sev-
eral years ago supposedly from the hole-
in-the-wall country in wyoming tom
was run out of the territory for rustling
he located in cherryvale is now wealthy
-and owns the bank that you robbed
and the youngster you disarmed is the son
of the man you compelled to open the safe
and give you the money

  henry laughed long and loud and re-
marked johnny that old owlhoot and
his partner worked me and my indians
from dawn until shortly before you ar-
rived re-branding those cattle and then
taking advantage of the fact that he knew
i was in desperate need of ready cash
paid me only ten dollars a head for them

  i told him that the bartender and cashier
could give a good description of me and
that the cashiers son would no doubt be
able to recognize me and tell them of my
whereabouts

  henry said you need have no fear of
the federal authorities taking action as
the crime was committed outside their
jurisdiction and besides they know mor-
row and bill both to be outlaws but if
tom learns that it was you that robbed
his bank he will send some of his gunmen
or kiowa indians into the territory to
kill you

  i told him morrow had better get busy
as i was leaving immediately for new
mexico i had arrived at that conclusion
while camped in the canyon henry starr
whom i esteemed above all men i had met
in the territory was taking desperate
chances by giving me shelter as he was
seriously suspected himself

  so against his urgent plea that i make
his house my home i bid him goodbye and
left for muskogee

  the next day i started on my journey
following that broad trail along the chero-
kee strip leading to that sanctuary for
badly wanted men the canyon country
among the bloody apache indians in new
mexico

       that strange wild company of trappers the free-trade legion



captain tomahawk

 a novel of the fur frontier

a dozen fires burned in the tim-
ber-ringed swale back of the river
along the bank a motley assort-
ment of canoes pirogues and bateaux lay
in the grass here and there were heaps
of roughly baled furs-prime plew from
the high valleys of the northland and
among these things spending idle talk and
rough humor like sailors ashore spending
money moved the free-trade legion old
williams abel stone renard celestine
pere satane-yankees canuks breeds
and a few renegade indians ousted from
their tribes on one pretext or another a
strange wild company of men living be-
yond the fringe of a frontier moving ever
more swiftly now into the west

  they came from the milk river the
platte the green and the snake they
brought their furs in to the rendezvous on
the bighorn here they uncovered the
buried keg of whiskey and began their wait

  at the center of the shapeless camp a
big-bodied great-bellied man sat near the
whiskey-barrel doling out its contents his
little eyes under shaggy protruding brows
ran paternally over the rendezvous car-
cajou shane had been the first trapper into
the north country always his was the
biggest catch and it was he who named
the meeting place for rendezvous the fol-
lowing year it was his pride that he had
fathered the legion and his greatest
pleasure was presiding over the whiskey-
barrel at rendezvous while the gay reckless
freemen did their trading and had their fun

  this year however uneasiness sat with
carcajou even in the tumult of raucous
laughter and rough bandinage some of
the brotherhood would never come in to
the bighorn they lay already forgotten
along some outland trail their furs gone
always hated by the trading companies
who wanted all men under contract the
free-trade was accustomed to occasional
quarrels but not to an unseen force which
stalked every stream in the north striking
swiftly and from behind shanes uneasi-
ness was that reasonless crawling of nerves



which presages war and his eyes were rest-
less with it

  thus when the tall stranger swung out
of the dark river and beached his canoe in
front of the fires carcajou swung his hand
in an unmistakable order celestine and the
renegade blackfoot blue wolf were among
the boats of the legion moving sound-
lessly they came up behind the stranger
as he straightened from mooring his canoe
and caught his elbows it was neat and
quick and sure shane grinned to himself
without leadership without orders or or-
ganization how smoothly the men of the
legion worked what an army they would
make if there ever was need

the stranger stabbed quick looks at
the men on either side of him but made
no defensive move as celestine and blue
wolf started him through the fires chaf-
fing remarks were flung at him as he moved

  celestines slippin down to huntin
two-legged mushrats offn the river

  big mushrat though big enough to
give blue wolf a fust-class wrassle
like enough a damn spy prowlin up
from the yankee companys post at fort
national lets give him a touch o fire
an send him back down the river bellerin
to his boss

  the stranger grinned faintly but made
no answer his two captors brought him
on to stand in front of carcajou shane
eyed the man carefully the boys were
right he was almost as big as the huge
blackfoot but trimmed down neater he
had level frosty blue eyes and cedar-
colored hair that curled at his shoulders
his rig showed signs of wear and travel
but the hilt of the green river knife and
the pistol in his belt were well-kept when
celestine and blue wolf stopped in front
of shane the stranger spoke

  you the boss of this shebang
carcajou shook his head aint no
boss in this camp son he said this is
a free-trade rendezvous and the man that
could boss it aint been born
captain tomahawk	

  the stranger pushed back his tattered
flat-crowned hat his eyes warming

  then i reckon thiss the place i been
looking for he chuckled gents youre
looking at a jigger thats got a bellyfull of
other folks meddlin and a plain unreason-
able hankering to paddle his own canoe
names tal hastings cornin all the way
up from leavenworth i been cutting for
sign of a partner that was cut from the
same cloth as me and from what i hear
i figgered on findin him here a lotip-
garou called carcajou shane

  shane let the sombreness slide from his
face when a mans been in the north
country a dozen years it makes a warm
place in him to find out his name travels
as far down-river as forth leavenworth
and beside this the newcomer had a reck-
less challenging light in his eyes which
sat well with carcajou shane the years
were creeping up on him and the fire of a
younger man might keep lonely camps
warm until this minute shane had never
thought of taking on a partner but the
idea suddenly struck home he grinned
nodded at the two who held the tall mans
elbows and stuck out his hand

  im shane he said shortly sit down
hastings got to forgive us if we met
you with a mite of an edge old mcfaim
up at fort benedict agreed last fall to
meet this rendezvous and take our furs
offn our hands hes six days overdue
right now and theres plenty hell loose
in this green country this season were
some rooty till mcfairn shows

  hastings straddled a log and dragged a
short stem-bitten pipe from his pocket
his eyes ran appreciatively over the stacked
furs which represented the seasons free-
trade catch across the whole of the north

  mcfairn-anglican man isnt he
seems ive heard of him an the hearing
was all bad you boys aiming to out-fox
a fox

  shane shrugged grizzlys more like it
when youre talkin of red john mcfairn
he said but damn mangy company men
theyve tied our heads up neat only one
other post in the territory-ab molines
fort national and moline wont take
our trade either you got a contract with
his yankee fur company or youre open
game to every rifle out of fort national
and to hell with your furs were playin

trades with a striped-backed skunk when
we deal with mcfairn but its either that
or haul our furs ourselves eighteen hun-
dred miles down to st joe aint much
choice

  hastings nodded his eyes running over
the camp again with their rapid keening
look a little suspicion roused in shane
as he watched that swift scrutiny but it
fled when the newcomer spoke again

  id been rooty too if i had me a
couple of bales of plew in these stacks
isnt a post on white-water that can boast
a take like this and mcfairn isnt the only
factor thatd burn a little powder to have
it turn up at st joe to his credit cornin
in a while ago i could hear a chanson
cornin out of here and see the fires a mile
away but there wasnt a hand laid to me
till i stepped ashore i heard there was
a first-class fur-war on up here between
the free-traders mcfaims anglican com-
pany and the yankee company at fort
national with four mens band of black-
feet prowlin to make it more interesting
but here you sit at an overdue rendezvous
without any outposts up and down river
to keep steel out of you back you boys
so tough a knife-blade cant hurt you

  carcajou shane colored it was in a
way a just criticism and the fault also
in a way was his but the boys didnt
come into a rendezvous after a long and
bitter winter to stand guard or patrol the
river they came in to make their trade
load new supplies and name next years
meeting-place they came to swap yarns
with old friends to lie owlishly to strangers
and to drink more whiskey than they could
hold the brotherhood was accustomed
to the jealousy of the companies and the
occasional malice of the roving blackfeet
and not for these things would a single
man of them forego an hour of the rowdy
joy of a rendezvous singly and scattered
they were the greatest warriors on the
rivers banded together they were in-
vincible they knew it and they feared no
attack

  shane stood up his eyes travelling appre-
hensively over the encampment down by
the river the canuks and the breeds had
gathered around the mad padre horse faced
old pere satane his dolorous bass was
leading off into the river-song of the
voyaguers
	frontier

  the surging rollicking chant of that
woods-tongue chanson eased shane its con-
fident reckless beat building up in him as
it always did he turned to hastings
spreading his hands wide with a smile

  what could hurt them he asked

  tal hastings had pulled his pistol from
his belt swiftly he shucked off the
weathered caps over the charges in its
cylinder and replaced them with gleaming
new ones when he raised his head his
eyes had grown bleak and sharp with
urgency

  maybe nothing he agreed shortly
but well damn soon find out i been try-
ing to break it gently half an hour ago i
sneaked past forty men headed by a red-
whiskered giant who might be john mc-
fairn they were headed this way and
they were toting war-not trade goods-
with em

ii

if tal hastings had felt doubt about
carcajou shane it swiftly fled the
old trapper stood woodenly for a moment
blinking his eyes and trying to understand
what tal had told him then he erupted
into a volcano of roaring action his great
voice lifted over the camp striking at the
scattered groups like a battering ram

  satane he bellowed abel williams
get a fire going down there on the water
douse the rest of em mcfairns cornin
-an he wants trouble

  in seconds the face of the camp changed
a slight lithe boy ran in from the bedding-
ground carrying a rifle and belt which he
handed to pere satane the singers
choked off their chanson dragging timber
swiftly onto the shingle at the waters edge
and starting a big fire fur-bales were
yanked back to the timber-fringe stacked
in one pile and two men spread out into
the grass on either side to guard them
the bung was slammed back into the
whiskey-barrel and it was rolled into the
brush

  the river-song was dead its rollicking
boastfulness was gone a grim line was
cut across faces which had been stupid with
drink or flushed with fun extra guns were
being charged ramrods whistling in their
bores shane himself had plunged down
among the boats flinging men right and

stories

left into positions from which they could
hamper an attack hastings grinned to
himself felt the excitement of the moment
lift him on the long trek out from the
missouri town there had been no way of
knowing if his hunch would work many
times he had wondered if he was a fool if
he had bitten off more than he could chew

  the reaction of this rendezvous of wild
men to the word he brought in with him
eased all of that and he forgot everything
except that a fight was facing a legion of
which he was to become an important part

  moments later the swiftly-running
shadows of war-canoes creased the smooth-
ness of the bighorn down on the river
bank the alarm raised

  hola ennemi and a moment later
confirming his guess as to the identity of
the crew he had passed mcfairn le
rouge mcfairn

  a rifle-shot drowned out the cry a
sheet of muzzle-flame licked in from the
river under its cover the canoes swung
sharply inward among the legions own
boats a man spun eerily and fell in the
mud others broke cover and ran for the
camp preferring to get behind the blazing
beacon now flaming high on the river-bank
to make their stand carcajou shane came
loping up his wide face dripping with
sweat and recharging his weapon as he
ran

  were spread too thin he howled at
tal theyll come ashore right in the
middle of us

  spread wider then hastings shot
back give em room and let em land
well make them sorry

  shane grunted apparently grateful for
someone elses strategy to bolster his own
he wheeled back roaring to the trappers to
give ground tal raced away in a circling
loop his eyes searching expertly for those
among the defenders who could be spared
from the present positions the first of
these he saw was the boy who had brought
satane his belt and gun the kid was
hunkered down behind a log laboriously
levelling a heavy rifle tal dropped a
quick hard hand to his shoulder

  save it for a minute trail me well
make it hot for em

  the boy looked up shook his head he
waved his hand toward a break of ground
closer to the river where satane and some
captain tomahawk	

of the canuks were braced against the
men pouring out of the landing canoes

  i always stick with pere he protested
ill be all right

  all right tal pulled up wheeled
back who gives a damn how youll be 
he snapped a kid your age should be
as good as a man now confound your
hairless chin get on your back legs and
track me weve got a fight to make
the kid colored and a blank half-amused
astonishment showed in his eyes but he
straightened lifted the heavy rifle and
started after tal circling the camp he
found three others-two sourdoughs from
the kansas country and a surly hatchet-
faced canuk swiftly hastings dropped
down through thewtimber and cut out to the
river swinging -upstream again he -brought
his little -company within a score of yards
of the big fire on the waters edge for
the first time he got a good look at the
attacking force it was strung out in a
double line between the water and the cen-
ter of the camp turning its fire two direc-
tions against the defenders crouched in
the timber on either side

  red john mcfairn called the red
by the canuks was about midway up the
line of his men watching for a chance to
work across to the stack of baled furs tal
dropped those with him into thick grass
and waited directly those defenders who
were with satane in the little break of
ground were caught in a -cross-fire and
forced to drop back when they did this
mcfairn shouted and a party broke for the
fur -bales tal turned to his little com-
pany then

  cut loose he barked tersely start
at the river pick every man off in that
double line you can work slow and work
sure mcfairns boys wont like lead in
their back any better than we do and we
might turn em

  when tal paused to reload his pistol
after the first round he saw that the kid
with the big rifle was having trouble with
its weight dropping his shot-pouch horn
and hand gun beside the slight figure he
lifted the rifle

  ill take that you reload for the rest
of us well make a fightingman out of
you yet

  the kid shot a quick venomous look up-
ward tal laughed and picked off a fort

benedict man who was swinging a gun
butt at one of the guards beside the fur
bales the hatchet-faced canuk among
those tal had recruited snarled at him

  stick to your shooting mon amt he
hissed leave the enfant be or pere
satanell close your big mouth with steel

  the kid shoved tals hand gun back
loaded his lips curled above even teeth
mind your own shooting celestine the
kid snapped youre doing precjous little
of it  

  there was a sharp sting to the words
and they were weighted with fact tals
grin widened at the black anger which
spread over the canuks face the kid
reached for a spent rifle and plumbed its
bore with a practiced stab of its rod tak-
ing up the short gun tals grin froze in
spite of the determined fire pouring out of
the grass into the backs of mcfairns men
the fort benedict chief had gotten half
a dozen of them among the piled furs
they were pawing swiftly for the choicest
bales and the way back to the boats was
held open by the still unbroken double line
of men worse another little party were
bucketing water out of the river over the
huge beacon shane had ordered lit on the
bank it was guttering low robbing the
flame-stabbed darkness of the camp of its
last light

barking a sharp order to keep the
fire coming from where they crouched
hastings leaped up and sprinted away from
the kid and his companions twice guns of
the defenders roared at him unable to tell
friend from foe but it was hard shooting
and the slugsnvent wide he drove straight
at where he had last seen mcfairn hoping
to take the leader and break the back of
the attack but mcfairn had moved in
the darkness and tal missed him he
turned a little and charged toward the
raiders at the fur bales across the camp
somebody else had the same idea carcajou
shanes drum-beat of a voice sledged into
the gloom

  give em steel lads-clean to the green
river

  it was a grim heartening cry tal fin-
gered the haft of the knife at his belt on
the flat of the blade just under the curl
of the hilt-guard was the name of the
weapon engraved deeply-green river
	frontier stories

a blade like that sunk to that lettering
meant a dead enemy in a good mans hands
carcajou was ordering the legion to close
in

  a man staggered close with a fur-bale
across his shoulders tal kicked his feet
out from under him sledged the top of
his head with the muzzle of his pistol and
ran on a gun spewed fire almost into his
face blinding him for a moment but he
caught one of the man arms jerking
the arm across the top of his shoulder he
wheeled and bent double forward throwing
the leverage of his body against the arm
bone snapped and the man who owned it
sailed limply over tals head

  down by the river a new alarm broke
theyre headin for the water
angling back toward the river at a full
run hastings crashed into another running
figure still thinking of mcfairn but un-
able to make out faces in the gloom tal
sank fingers into this mans shoulders the
fellow turned like a huge cat swinging a
hard fist into tals face it shoook him to
his moccasins and he went down but he
pulled the man with him frantically he
rolled on the grass trying to get clear and
when the others bulk pressed him he set
his steel-corded legs about the middle of
his opponent in a merceless scissors grip
they lay together silently their breath
whistling one resisting a deadly grip the
other trying to bring it into full play down
by the river tal heard firing build rapidly
up then come to an abrupt halt a harsh
angry shout raised up along the water

  the dirty back-stabbin night-prowlin
sons they got away all of em 

  the man under tal rolled against the
scissors in a superhuman effort which gave
him a moments breath before the merciless
grip shifted expertly and closed again

  the hell they all got away the man
wheezed desperately get a hand up here
quick ive got one of the devils

  with a grunt tal broke his hold and sat
up something tugged at him with the
sound of that half-boastful half-pleading
voice something that had to get out of
him before it split him wide open his
laugh echoed against the timber

  hastings carcajou shane grunted
painfully from a yard away you damn
you for a belly-bustin bull-snake aint a
whole rib in my carcass

ill

count of the furs by newly-lighted
fires showed mcfairns raiders had
gone down the bighorn richer by three bales
of prime plew a count of the dead showed
he had plenty of room in his bateaux
for the fur on the home trip for he had lost
eleven men to four from the rendezvous
this count of the legions tally together
with the knowledge that the fort bendict
crew had been twice as strong as their own
drew some of the sting of the raid the
only sorehead in the battle-marked ren-
dezvous was carcajou shane who rubbed
at his ribs and scowled blackly at tal
hastings but there was a glint of high
fun in the old trappers eyes which belied
the blackness of his face

  the same glint was in pere satanes jet
eyes when he led the kid who tracked with
him across to where tal was sitting

  ah msieu satane said solemnly
pere owes to you a great something for
tree year i have take care of this little
one here for tree year i have try to
do what nature have make impossible-i
have try to fashion a voyagcur of this one
but you-ah msieu turning to the
rest of the company satane raised his voice
roguishly  camarades hola what a
woods-runner this one is in one little
fight he is promise to make a man of mili
and he does it mili swears that now she
is a man by gar

  tal stared at the kid the more he
stared the more he saw what a fool he had
been this was a girl facing him a small
beautiful girl with the devil in her dark
eyes and her jet hair rolled tight to her
head to fit under her river-cap he felt
heat flood his face he saw the blackness
drop from shanes scowl he heard the
old trapper break into a roaring laugh
that paid him back in full for his own glee
at having bent carcajous ribs in the dark
alone of the camp the girl didnt laugh
but the mischievous taunting little smile
on her lips was harder to bear than the
howls of the legion he pulled to his
feet in embarrassment

  what now he asked shane the
old trapper scrubbed the tears of joy from
his eyes and sobered

  why now tal he said slowly i
reckon most of usll want to go after a
captain tomahawk	

little of that plew that grows atop two-
legged critters up fort benedict way
well want a place we can work from
then tal said thoughtfully a place
where we can mould our bullets and stack
our furs without getting caught like we
were tonight

  carcajou eyed tal speculatively after
a-moment he stood up and jerked his head
away from the fires

  son he said quietly i want to talk
to you

  tal followed him into the shadows at the
fringe of timber shane bit a huge chaw
out of a plug of trade tobacco and rolled
it reflectively across his tongue finally
he spoke

  looky hastings youve made a good
dent with most of the boys at this gatherin
but they aint fools no moren me none
of us is swallerin appearances-that you
jest happened along two jumps ahead of
them benedict wolves its a nice yarn
about how you heard of me clean down in
leavenworth and tracked all the ways up
here to find me only trouble is it dont
hang together you talked jest now
like you aimed to string along with us
mebbe youll tell me why

  tal had been expecting this he reached
carefully for his words his whole mis-
sion in the north country hung on how
this grizzled old veteran sized him up

  i did hear of you in leavenworth he
said slowly and thats where i came
from as to why i came thats got to ride
for now say i heard there was a war up
here and i wanted me a piece of it when
the signs right ill lay out the rest of
the story till then ive got to be a fur
man fighting a fur mans fight or ive
got to get out its up to you shane
the old man stood woodenly for a long
moment- tal felt shrewd old eyes measur-
ing him clear to the roots finally car-
cajou shot out his hand

  we need you son he said quietly
we need you bad you got a hand at
leadin a fight and such gents are scarce
ill pass the word through the bunch most
of em will stick by us i think but therell
be soreheads mostly celestines canuks
celestines a bad one and he dont take
shovin even when its to save his own
skin and he was one of them you shoved
down to the creek tonight along of mili

  tal shrugged you work a crew up
the way you think well try to hit on a
good hideout tonight in the morning im
going back down river to molines post on
powder river if were aiming to tackle
mcfairn itd be nice to know moline
wouldnt come at us when we were caught
short ive got a notion i can talk that
yankee fur factor into pullin in his horns
complete

  you got that hunch from listenin at
leavenworth again shane said drily
ab molines alius had a streak of cat in
him but his own trappers workin on the
starvation contracts he hands out bucked
him enough to keep his claws plumb wore
down to the quick he was mostly talk
and damned little do but somethin hap-
pened to him this winter chests popped
out half a foot got plain cussed cant
figger it unless somebodys proddin him or
hes got hisself a new brand of brave-maker
to drink

  hastings shrugged the two of them
walked back into the camp it had split
apart abel stone and old williams
satane and mili four or five others who
had come up trails from the south in the
beginning were gathered at one fire
celestine had drawn the canuks the breeds
and blue wolf the renegade blackfoot
down to the boats as tal and carcajou
came out of the timber celestine moved
up toward them his men splitting off
toward the scattered fur pile

  shane celestine said softly for long
tam i think you getting old too old for
smart trappair certainment now is
proof you take this hastings like he is
the brother could be yankee fur com-
pany spy making trap no is cannarade
could be spy for rouge mcfairn making
trap for fools also no is good voyaguer
bah not for celestine the fur she is
scatter from the bale nobody know which
belong to him or how much celestine
takes his men and they take one half of fur
more easy this way than counting hein
as he spoke the canuk slid close to
carcajou shane the old trappers face
darkened appoplectically

  half he roared you stinking lynx
you and them white bellies thatve listened
to you never took a quarter of that stack
over there damn you celestine for
ten seasons the free-trades stuck together


frontier stories

and because we did weve made our way
you know that now when were against
our toughest haul you slide out id see
you in hell before you take half of that
plew

  a thin smile creased the canuks face
a hand whipped to the back of his neck
returning with a wicked broad-bladed trap-
pers knife he thrust the steel forward
till it pressed against the swell of shanes
belly

  stand easy shane everbody stand
easy the knife is sharp and the hand
quick celestine was aim to play fair
now he is a lynx pouf i a lynx don
care what he do so we take all the fur
if there is fight carcajou die-so

  he made a short ugly motion of the
knife which if had been thrust deep would
have disembowled the big trapper shanes
face was white stone and williams and
the others stood like graven granite careful
that they didnt startle the renegade into
thrusting his steel home pere satane his
queer intense eyes burning with a savage
fire trembled but he held his arms rigidly
at his sides

the canuks companions hastily loaded
themselves with fur and started for
the boats mili duquesne let out a tor-
tured cry and flung herself at celestine

  he caught her with his free arm pulled
her in close to him ignoring the flailing of
her hard little hands

  ha la fleur he grinned this time
room only for plew and my men but one
soon day-ah you will see mon enfant
that time i will come for you

  squirming madly mili bent and sank
her teeth into celestines arm with a
sharp angry oath he flung her spinning
from him she clung to his wrist until
he shook her savagely free

  it happened in a moment but it was the
little break in the canuks attention that
tal needed his hand moved easily across
in front of his belt his pistol slid from
leather levelled and fired in a smooth
rythm

  celestines knife spun angrily off into
space the renegade screamed and clutched
at his shattered wrist tal moved forward
forcing the man back toward his boats
with every step abel stone and old wil-
liams had their guns up stonily on the

canuks crew bales of fur spilled from
nerveless shoulders in moments the whole
party was at the edge of the water

  shove off tal told celestine tone-
lessly

  the canuk whimpered but the plew
-one quarter belongs to us

  shove off the words were as brittle
as shattered ice celestine stood uncer-
tainly for a moment his eyes blazing and
the pain of his wound pulling his face into
an ugly mask of hatred then he turned
and stepped into the batteau

  carcajou stood at tals elbow until the
boats were lost in the shadows over the
river finally he turned and touched tals
arm

  thanks son he said simply

  mili sat hunkered over the fire when
they turned back into the camp one hand
up to an ugly bruise across one cheek a
hot blaze burned in her eyes but it was
no match for the consuming heat in those
of pere satane crouched in awkward com-
fort beside her satane looked up as tal
and shane approached

  mysel i come from the lak country to
the far nort i am canuk by gar one
tam i am man of peace i am padre i carry
the book then i am sick in my head
and i am no longer a good padre i am
devil i take off my coat i trow the
book away i am maudit plenty maudit
then i find mon enfant my little flower
she make me different again

  he stopped looked wildly around him
is insult to patrie to lak country to
canuk that devil he trow down la
fleur and mak promise to her satane
mak promise too with my hand slow
plenty slow i kill him one soon day

  mili jerked her hand sharply pere
be quiet

  a gentleness was in her voice which
seemed to wilt the heat from satanes body
he sat back his long and powerful body
slack his eyes docile she turned to tal

  those furs-a part of them-belonged
to celestine

  tal nodded

  but you kept them

  he nodded again

  you talk about fighting mcfairn and
theres also msieu moline at fort national
they have furs too

  well take fur wherever we find it
captain tomahawk	

miss tal said quietly just as well take
trouble wherever it comes well store the
fur until its all done

  and when it is done msieu war-maker
what then

  tal grinned why then well divide it
like-

  like all good thieves eh mil cut in
her face lightened a lopsided grin pulling
engagingly at her bruised features well
divide it with the poor some to anglican
fur company when it promises to be good
some to ed moline when hes blown all
the powder from his guns some even to
poor celestine if he escapes pere that long
i like you leather-man you have strong
hard hands and a quick gun the north-
land needs you i heard you speak of a
hiding-place good i give you one

milis haven on the poposia fork of
the bighorn was ideal a hidden bowl
formed by an accident of geology and ero-
sion the poposia had its beginning some-
where in the heart of the towering wind
river range working down from the
divide the little river had found its way
blocked by the sharp unbroken rise of the
last ridge between itself and the great
basin searching with the persistence of
water it had found a crevass and had cut
an underground channel through the ridge
on the basin side it jetted out of solid
rock like a huge spring what mili and
pere santane had discovered was that in
some previous age the poposia had cut
another such underground channel under
the ridge then had abandoned it for the
one it now used there was then a few
rods from where the river burst from the
rock cliff a brush-covered hole which was
the mouth of a water-worn tunnel leading
under the front peaks to the little bowl of
le havre-the haven

  a cabin was built there ample water
and grass were at hand the steeply-
sloping sides of the little bowl and the
towering mountains about it made entry
impossible except by way of the tunnel
a trail was worked up one wall to a pin-
nacle on the front ridge from which the
whole of the bighorn basin spread out
into the haze of distance it was a place of

security to which battle-scarred men could
retreat for rest and relaxation tal was
pleased but a curiosity tagged him he
dragged carcajou shane to one side

  this girl he said whered she come
from mili and an old renegade like
satane its a funny set-up

  you dont know shane shrugged in
surprise mili was picked up by four
mens band of blackfeet when she was so
young that all she can remember is her
first name maybe fifteen-sixteen year ago
nobody but old four men knows where
he got her he kept her with his own
daughter for years satane was on one of
his loony spells and seen her in the black-
foot camp tried to buy her out old
four men like to busted a biood-pipe he
got so upset over anyone tryin to get her
away from him had satane snatched up
by the slack of his breeches and tossed
outn the camp

  satane got the notion she was some
kin of his and sneaked her outn four
mens lodge lord knows how been
sort of a game of hiden seek ever since
part of the time since then satanes been
sane enough to know shes jest a strange
white gal part of the time he thinks shes
got his own blood but loony or not that
canuk has shore took care of the kid
taught her everything he knew then he
put her in a mission over on the belle
fourche four men found out where she
was and hit the place with a hundred braves
but satane was an hour ahead of him
and got her out they found this place
then and holed up here trapping in the
valleys behind le havre and just pokin
their heads out for supplies at rendezvous

  this information eased tals curiosity

  we could do with more men carcajou
he said the old trapper looked up quickly
his eyes twinkling knowingly at the change
of subject

  we could he agreed solemnly me
and abel stone was talkin theys a few
boys across south pass on the upper green
that didnt come in this spring like as
not they been cut down by company wolves
from forth benedict or fort national
but we figgered it might be worth while
takin a look-see for em even with them
though boy we aint got a army and them
two company posts have got plenty guns

tional

  ill try tal grinned

fort national headquarters post of the
yankee fur company sat on a low
headland at the junction of the yellowstone
and the powder river four hundred miles
north and east of le havre hastings in a
light canoe rode into its landing after noon
of the fifth day he had kept to his pad-
dling steadily but he hadnt tried to make
a record run and hed had time to do a
lot of thinking coming up from leaven-
worth he had hoped that he could parley
not only with the factor at fort national
but also with red john mcfairn the at-
tack on the free-trade rendezvous had ruled
that out it was pretty plain that mcfairn
was partly responsible at least for the
blood tinting the white-water rivers

  ab moline was a different matter car-
cajou had pointed out that the man usually
mild had changed in the past season it
was possible that a palaver would be a
wasted effort with him too the rich fur
sign on every hand on his trip up the yel-
lowstone convinced tal that this north
country was a stake worth fighting for
and if moline chose to fight the brother-
hood at le havre would have two dan-
gerous enemies

  for a while hastings planned to talk
plain to moline yankee was after all
an american company its factor might
be impressed by tals true identity if he
was things would go simply at the post
but if he wasnt his knowledge of the facts
behind tals coming into the country would
peril the whole plan by which hastings
hoped to secure a peace between the war-
ring fur factions in the last moment
hastings dccidcd to carry on the same pose
by which he had won a place among the
free-traders

  he stepped ashore into a stockade which
looked more like a regimental army bar-
racks than a traders establishment every
man was heavily armed even down to the
shoshone attendants a truculent hostile
tension was in the air two gun-braced
trappers closed in on him as he started
across the compound one of them touched
his arm halting him

  i suppose you and yore partner was
bound in with a load of fur you got

jumped lost yore furs and yore pard was
kilt so you come in to square up

  tal eyed the two men i might he
agreed

  the trapper who had spoken laughed
short and ugly a damn free-trader
then he exulted we got a welcome
for you woods-runners shuts a howl up
quickern anything you ever see it goes
like this-

  he and his fellow moved forward with
anticipation tal had seen a like game
played often enough on the arkansas
two men with a third between them could
deal that third man a terrific amount of
punishment in but moments and at the
same time not harm him seriously it was
as good a way as any other of taking the
fight out of a man quickly as these two
closed tal ducked down straightening both
arms out at once as he leaped upward again
he caught one full in the face smashing
him fiat and kicking the other man had
turned away from that streaking blow
taking it on his shoulder he roared now
pawing at an enormous muzzle-loader in
his belt

  tal jerked his own gun free saw the
man was slow and deliberately stepped in
with a seemingly gentle wipe of the
weapon he laid its solid barrel against the
mans head just under the edge of his fur
cap the blow made a sharp little sound
like a tapped melon the man dropped
limply tal turned on his heel angling
toward a door marked with a little office
sign the compound was spotted with
rooted men who had watched eagerly for
the climax of the little game their two fel-
lows played now they stood surly and
dark-faced suddenly very careful under
hastings swinging gaze

  pushing the door ahead of him open tal
stepped into ab molines office two men
were there one was a tall booted young-
ster in the uniform of the united states
cavalry the other was a slight man with
a high intelligent forehead and the quick
restless movements of the neurotic the
first impression was good that here was a
man you could sit down and talk to whod
hear you out then the impression died
and there was only a pair of queer terribly
intense eyes staring out above great dark
circles on strain-marked cheeks tal
stopped in front of molines desk
captain tomahawk	

  thanks for the welcome mon factor
he said drily

  the factors stare held unbrokenly and
he made no answer the cavalry man in
the corner stepped eagerly forward

  im bill starrett ninth cavalry at-
tached at fort laramie i did a hitch at
council bluffs a few seasons ago i ought
to know you mister im sure ive seen
you

  tal sensed the army man was lonely and
uncomfortable that he was eager for some-
one to talk to but the risk was too great
he shook his head slowly

  no soldier he said no youve
never seen me he didnt make it loud
but the quiet words struck like rams star-
rett looked at him keenly for a moment
and then backed up shaking his head for
the first time moline spoke

  there isnt any welcome for strangers
at fort national brother but you got
past the boys so say your piece and get
out his voice had a rough and peculiarly
uneven gait to it tal realized the man
was deadly serious he spoke as abruptly
himself

  out on the poposia is a party of honest
trappers thatve turned pirate till they get
back what was taken from them theyre
going to a gunsmoke palaver with john
mcfairn if you dont want them here
call your gundogs off the fur trails and
open your post goods to free-trade like a
white man

  moline seemed only barely able to under-
stand the words he continued to stare
his lips moved again

  free-traders he muttered damned
free-traders and youre one of them

  tal nodded a fanatical grin pulled
molines lips upward

  see that soldier he asked stabbing
toward the corner with a long trembling
finger he brought dispatches up to me
from lieutenant cowan at fort laramie
tomorrow he goes back with a letter from
me telling cowan to come north with his
troop how long could your pirates on
the poposia last against the united states
army and the first command cowan
will give when he gets here is to your firing-
squad ill hold you for him thats my
answer thats my answer to your trouble-
making big-mouthed belly-aching woods-
runners

  tal tilted back on his heels cowan
lieutenant jackie cowan poor devil
he wondered what cowan would do in the
open field against the generalship of such
men as carcajou shane and satane the
thought brought a smile to his lips the
smile stayed moline made big talk about
keeping him here but if hed been able
to walk unharmed into this office hed
walk out of the post the same way he
switched his head toward the soldier in the
corner meaning to say something but
starretts eye were wide in sudden sound-
less alarm

   desperately tal flung to one side drag-
ging at his belt-gun but he was too late
a rifle-barrel swung carefully from be-
hind skewed his hat off and something like
a whole magazine of powder exploded in-
side of his head he tried to keep his feet
under him to continue the lift of his gun
but his strength drained swiftly the room
darkened and he pitched forward

hastings roused to the shaking of
an insistent hand he was flat on his
back on a rough cot in a small dark room
the only light came through a grated open-
ing in the door he sat up and as he did so
his hand brushed the shoulder of the figure
bending above him his fingers went
through a soft hanging mass of heavy
hair it was a woman

  quiet the figure whispered cor-
poral starrett is with me keep low and
follow us

   tal came off the cot like a cat shook his
head to clear it and moved forward after
two figures who slid out the door ahead of
him outside they swiftly skirted the in-
side wall of the compound keeping to deep
shadow and not halting until they had come
up against a small heavily barred door at
the lower end of the enclosure they
paused here a moment tal coming up with
them starrett fumbled with the great
bars sliding them noiselessly back light
was a little better and tal could dimly see
the woman

  she was young apparently about the
same age as mili she had the same high
sensitive features as ab moline but her
lips were more full the hair which tal
had inadvertantly touched was a warm rich


frontier stories

gold which she wore with a proud uncon-
scious tilt of her head she kept close to
the cavalrymans elbow and tal caught the
brightness in starretts eyes as he turned
back to her then the gate was open and
they were through the girl caught tals
arm outside the stockade

  you were a fool to come in here like
you did today she hissed but you
couldnt know that fort national is a
powder-keg ruled by a man out of his head
thats why i got bill to help me get you
out dont expect anything more from
me though im anne moline and ill
stick with dad whatever he does whatever
happens

   bill starrett bent over her his voice
rough with urgency your dads a wild
man anne he said he doesnt even
know you half the time i was here two
days before he could make enough sense
out of my dispatches to figure out who i
was hes got every cutthroat in the north
in here now it isnt safe for you im
leaving for laramie in the morning come
with me

  the girl shook her head no bill
somethings come over dad somethings
squeezing down on him ive seen him
break like this before ive got to find out
whats troubling him and end it hell be
all right then its just that his nerves
get too tight for his body when hes under
pressure

   starrett shook his head soberly

   tal touched starretts sleeve i think
you know who i am he told the soldier
starrett nodded gravely keep it to your-
self i dont know what moline wrote in
the message hes sending to the com-
mandant at laramie but you go in to
lieutenant cowan and tell him you saw me
then you tell him to keep his troop away
from up here tell him that if he doesnt
hell lose every man tell him for me
starrett touched his cap

  tal turned to anne moline

   the girl pointed to the river some of
the men raided your canoe and looted out
your equipment i had bill get up another
one from our stores its loaded and ready
to go shove off trapper and stay long
gone from the powder river

  moments later hastings was on the
water dipping his paddle strongly against
the lazy current of the yellowstone

  six nights later bitterly weary from
endless hours dipping his canoe up-
stream he came to the confluence of the
poposia and the bighorn and beached his
canoe in deep brush for two days he had
been on edge normally ranging the higher
country at this season the black feet were
in the basin their sign was plentiful and
twice the last day he had been forced to
haul out into hiding while small parties
had passed him on the river still twenty
miles from le havre and too weary to
drive on he would have liked a fire and a
hot meal but he made it a dry camp
rolling into a blanket in the brush beside
his canoe an hour later he fought out
of a drug-like sleep to hear a strange sound
rolling down the river a chanson with a
solitary singer

        runners of the woods-

         hunters of the fur-

         men of the river

        some are dead young-

        some are dead old-

          we live forever   

  the voice came closer the singer ap-
parently skirting the near bank with his
canoe tal tumbled from his blankets with
a curse carcajou coming down-river
into all this indian sign and with that
stentorian voice blaring out ahead of him
tal was in the water to his thighs when
shane came abreast in the darkness
afraid to raise a shout loud enough to
break through the old trappers chant tal
smacked the palm of his hand down flat
onto the water with a smart chop the
sound was like that of a beavers tail warn-
ing a colony of coming danger carcajous
voice choked off in mid-syllable his great
shoulders leaned against his paddle spin-
ning the canoe in toward the brush like
a live thing tal caught the prow of the
craft and towed it on in as it hit the
bank shane piled over its side squinting

  hastings he grunted what the
devil   

  tal was trotting swiftly back to his own
 canoe as he buckled his belt on with its
 pouch horn knife and gun he snapped
 one soft word over his shoulder

  blackfeet

  then he jerked up his rifle and began
cutting through the timber for higher
captain tomahawk	

ground shane lumbered along behind si-
lently that one clipped word had answered
everything he needed to know the two
of them travelled swiftly but the black-
feet were ahead of them tal had heard
that this one tribe of indians could see in
the dark like a cat he believed it in the
first twenty rods they flung themselves
silently prone twice just in time to avoid
a streaking brave cutting for the river

  the third time they were not so lucky
no single warrior but a wide-flung hawk-
eyed net swept toward them watching
the charging shadows tal measured his
chances then he stood up holding his
rifle high above his head with both hands
grunting satisfaction the indians sur-
rounded them took their guns and prodded
them forward they moved for half an
hour through heavy timber coming out at
last into a grassy little park surrounding
a spring-head several small cooking-fires
were burning but there were no lodges in-
dicating that this was one of the several
hunting-parties whose tracks had troubled
tal the past two days

  the two prisoners were marched across
to the central fire where a tall incredibly
wrinkled old man stood waiting he stared
at the two white men for a long time in
haughty silence finally he spoke

  this is the land of the blackfeet for
many years there have been white men
among us and there has been room now
the white men make war among themselves
there is no longer room four men now
has need of the white girl who was his
daughter where is she 

  tals knowledge of the formal blackfoot
tongue was unequal to the old mans
sonorous speech carcajou translated for
him ending up with his own explanation

  thats four men hisself son and
i judge hes lookin for mili i dont get
the connection between white men and war
and room in the country and her but
we dont know nothin dont fergit

  tal nodded you take the play from
here on out ill back you up

  carcajou spoke to the old chief at length
waving his hands in wide gestures and with
considerable haughtiness of his own tal
saw that the indian was impressed he
stood a long time in obvious thought then
he shrugged spoke swiftly and turned dis-

-frontier stories-fall

interestedly back to the fire a pair of
warriors seized the two prisoners bound
them securely and rolled them against an
out-thrust rock where they were visible to
every eye in the camp when the two in-
dians had moved away carcajou swore
heartily

  blast his pemmicanned red hide he
snorted i really put her on for him
made a mighty important and interestin
gent out of you claimed you was a big
stick in the army which four men has
got a healthy respect for i claimed we
was fresh from fort laramie-that we
hadnt seen a woman in six months i
threw in everything i could think of then
just when i think ive got him stopped
he shrugged the old devils smart says
i am a passable liar but that mili was stolen
by a white man we are white men so
by hell we know where mili is

  tal grinned wryly hell find out dif-
ferent 

  shore carcajou agreed grimly but
well be a mite uncomfortable while hes
doin so it appears they been makin
plenty tracks in their hunt for mili and all
his boys is tired but they got a elk to-
night theyre goin to feed big and
in the mornin theyll get around to pryin
for what they want to know with hot sticks
only seen one man that could walk after
a pryin like that and he was blind as a
bat

  carcajou fell morosely silent tal
watched the camp before him prepare for
their feast his own belly was empty and
it made him uncomfortable to watch the
big steaks beginning to sizzle over the
flames he turned his head toward to
comment that this was itself no mild form
of torture but the old trapper bound
as he was and stacked awkwardly against
the rock had coolly dropped off into a heavy
sleep tal grinned no breed of man that
ever walked was the equal of these grizzled
runners of the woods directly he found
himself getting drowsy and he followed
carcajou off

  hours later he was jerked upright
against his bonds by a queer foreign sound
on the thin night air shane was already
awake breathing heavily among the em-
bers of the fires four mens warriors were
bunched in startled huddles the sound
came again down the slope toward the


frontier stories

river a rollicking challenging metallic
sound which could not be mistaken

  a bugle tal gasped a bugle blow-
ing charge hell it cant be

  but it was four men barked quick or-
ders his men slid hastily into the night
moments later three men broke into the
clearing at a full run back in the timber
guns barked sniping at the swift shadows
of the retreating blackfeet the first of
the three to reach the two bound men was
abel stone slung across his shoulder by
a blackened thong was the battered loops
of an ancient army issue bugle stone
caught tals amazed stare at the instrument
as he bent over his bonds he chuckled

  old brassys the best damn injun-
fighter i ever seen never without her on
the trail like today carcajou pulled
outn the green river country ahead of
me i was bringing back the bunch of boys
we rounded up over there when i got to
le havre and he wasnt there yet i was
worried some thought id been smellin
blackfeet last two or three days so we
cut down-river till we found your canoes
carcajou pulled himself to his feet chaf-
fing his wrists

  abel he said sourly theres times
youre a handy gent but you shore tor-
ture music on that horn

  stone grinned it did for four men
but it wont hold him long likely hes
got other parties about wed better skin
for the river and make le havre afore
he gets us all

vi

tal and carcajou together with abel
stones party came up through the
little bowl taking their ease after break-
fast tals eyes swept over the company
eagerly taking little note of the fact that
the brotherhood was growing one face
was missing from the company he cor-
nered pere satane

  wheres mili

  satane gestured up the little trail which
lead to the lookout at the summit of the
front ridge tal turned in that direction
but pere caught his arm

  non mon ami he said always
she go alone not even me does she take
when she goes to look presently she will
be back but she say that one on watch

cannot use the eye if the lips are busy in
talk with another be patient msieu
la fleur has been a long time in le havre
she will not vanish

  tal pulled up suddenly aware of his
obvious eagerness to see the girl satane
cackled gleefully as if he had made a great
joke and ambled off his long frame cast-
ing an angular shadow on the ground
carcajou came across from one of the fires
carrying two brimming mugs of whiskey
tal was grateful he needed a shakedown
carcajou squatted and began to trace aim-
less figures in a patch of gravel

  four mens got me worried he said
when blackfeet gits restless the lids bilin
offn hell for sartain them devils have
got no soul four mend soon jine one
enemy to wipe out another as not if him
and red mcfairn was to get together wed
have a plenty tough steak to chew boy
he likely did work down this way look-
ing for mili tal agreed and hes likely
got some oily scheme in his pouch that he
needs her for or he wouldnt be looking so
hard but something else dragged him
down here too id like to know the
worst way

  carcajou gnawed at his tobacco plug
and stared sourly at the ground suddenly
he looked up

  howd you do at fort national

  tal shrugged wonderful he said
disgustedly fine got a knot on my
head and had my breeches pulled out of a
tight lock-up by straight luck

  swiftly he ran in the details of his talk
with ed moline and his escape carcajou
whistled

  things is blackenin up just about as
fast for us as that rain on the mountains
back there id say there was a fair chance
that anglican and yankee mought git to-
gether then if four men found we had
mili here or decided he wanted some moun-
tain-man hair wed be caught in as nasty
a middle as i ever want to see only one
good thing in the shebang that young
corporal skiddin down to laramie gives us
an edge you see what abels bugle done
last night think what the brass-button
boys could do themselves

  tal shook his head thats the one
thing we dont want carcajou he said
sombrely weve got to keep that little
army detachment from fort laramie out
captain tomahawk	

of the basin weve got to those soldiers
are the fightingest there are but theyve
been trained to plains work the timber
and rivers up hered cross them completely
theyre only one company four men
could gobble them up alone in a quarter
hour if he caught them out in the basin
and once his black feet had defeated an
army command theyd lose their fear of
the brass buttons and the carbines there
wouldnt be anything to hold them in check
theyd clean every white out of the north
theyd sweep the country clear to the
platte

  carcajous eyes widened in sudden un-
derstanding he started to say something
but he was cut off by a quick eager voice
calling from above

  tal tal hastings

  rocking back on his heels tal looked up
half way down the trail from the lookout
mili was beckoning to him eagerly he
leaped up running for the foot of the trail
in moments he was panting beside her
she turned and went on toward the top
still motioning him to follow she ran
up the winding track with an effortless
ease which defeated him when he reached
the summit he was blowing hard she
laughed	

  a mountain-man  pouf more like
a swamp-bear the imps in her eyes
danced for a moment then they grew more
serious

  you want for the fur you want for
the fight you want for the pirating eh
look

  she pointed out over the basin on a
wide bend of -the bighorn under a low pass
leading across to the sweetwater valley
to the south a mass of batteaux and
pirogues were beaching closer at hand
six indian canoes were drifting sluggishly
with the current it was a picture that
didnt fit together hastings turned stupidly
to the girl

  you tell msieu moline at fort na-
tional he is make peace with us or he lose
his fur no

  tal nodded

  certainment she went on breathlessly
then i tell you how this is the north
country is milis country she know it
when you leave fort national word is
go to the red mcfairn at fort benedict
that he will lose his furs also rouge

mcfairn is a smart oiie he thinks the
furs will be taken when he makes his ship-
ment down the musselshell and the mis-
souri so he thinks to fool you he
makes a short peace with four men the
blackfeet come in to trouble you and
while this is so mcfairn brings his furs
up the bighorn under your nose portage
across to the sweetwater and takes them
down the platte

  tal squinted out over the vast area be-
low trying to identify the boats on the
bend and the canoes on the river milis
guess was fantastic bu-t it had a ring of
logic which fitted in with what he knew of
john mcfairn

  wish i had a glass he said absently

  the girl drew herself up her eyes snap-
ning a glass when milis eyes are here
to look for you look at the bend now
six batteaux four pirogues maybe twenty
bales of the fur then twenty shoshones
to carry them across the portage also
maybe forty trappers with guns and now
closer on the river six canoes in the
woods back of them where the green is
more of them fifty blackfeet waiting
for you to come racing down the river to
the fur-boats is a nice trap no

  tal straightened his eyes reached out
to the low pass between the basin and the
sweetwater through which the portage
would have to file

  he voiced his thoughts

  we could hit them out there might
get away with it too if another party
worked down the river to keep four mens
braves busy

  mili laughed excitedly she started to
sing

        runners of the woods--
        hunters of the fur-

  she stopped abruptly her eyes on the
storm-clouds carcajou had earlier seen
forming against the main range of the big
windies

  rain she said a hard one the
last time i saw clouds like that so much
water came into le havre that the river
went out of its new channel into its old
one for half a day and our tunnel was
blocked

  tal eyed the clouds and saw something
else in them itll be wet travelling but
	frontier

that storms made for us we can come
in right on top of them without being seen
if waters dropping hard enough

  mili shrugged and turned down the trail
into le havre

tal split command of the attack be-
tween carcajou shane and himself
they worked it out in fine detail car-
cajou took thirty of the fastest trackers
in the company assembled at le havre and
started out as the rain began in a wide
loop toward the saddle of the pass a few
minutes later with satane to guide tal
loaded the remainder of the crew in four
canoes and started down the river

  in the midst of flashing lightning and
the ear-splitting roll of thunder they en-
gaged the fringe of four mens ambush
and broke the thing out into the open
they ran some risk lessened by the driv-
ing rain in working from canoes but
the whole idea was to convince four men
that this was a raiding party sent out to
try for mcfairns furs for two hours
they kept a running shifting attack going
on the river at the end of that time they
began to draw back as though slowly re-
treating under four mens pressure

  in point of fact the violent storm so
cowed the superstitious blackfeet that they
put up little show in late afternoon tal
bundled his men and made a quick run at
four mens advanced party they gave
hurriedly turning his own crew on their
heels then tal raced them up the river
hid their canoes and got them into the
secret tunnel into le harve before the
indians could close up and find the en-
trance

  by this time the rain had risen to a
sullen roar cascading down savagely from
a leaden sky hastings was a little uneasy
about carcajous party when he saw that
a little trickle of water was already begin-
ning to run through the entrance tunnel
but when they came out of the bore into
the open of le harve he found the other
section of the attack was back ahead of
him the whole bowl despite the pelting
rain was echoing with high humor the
floor of the cabin was littered with fresh
bales of fur and under guard of a dozen
eager guns john mcfairn himself stood
prisoner

  carcajou came up clapped a heavy hand

stories

to tals shoulder he jerked a derisive
thumb at the huge red-bearded factor

  this curly wolfs been howlin for our
chief he exulted sail into him boy
haul his teeth make him spit sideways
and walk like a duck	

  so youre the lad that planned this
coup mcfairn growled youre a good
planner hastings but you dont look
far enough ahead you got some fur off
of me youve got me for the time but
you cant hold me old jean blanchard
who owns my company put me at fort
benedict because i couldnt be beaten and
i cant youll see theres different days
coming in the north days when john
mcfairns top dog and nothing between
me and leavenworth that dont play my
music

  talk hastings said in flat scorn the
factors face swelled with rage

  talk he choked why damn you
ill have you flayed in my compound by
fall in two weeks old blanchard is due
in at my post on his yearly inspection of
anglican forts ill take him out to see
what a couple drunk shoshones can do to
you afore i tell him benedict belongs to
me not to his skinflint company any more

  tal shrugged turning away but mc-
faims boasts had a ring of assurance be-
hind them which made him uneasy a
moment later mili touched his arm and
pointed at the foot of the bowl waters
were churning there overflowing from the
river passage to go rolling into the en-
trance tunnel with the girl at his side
he moved back to the prisoner motioning
for satane to cut the tight bonds which
held him

  then he faced mcfairn

  the tunnels full of water he said
you cant get away maybe youll want
to walk around youre going to be pris-
oner in this valley till weve got a peace
in the north and youre going to be a
prisoner on a long ride down the big river
to the territories you better use your
legs while you can 

  mcfairn made no answer when he
was freed he walked aimlessly toward the
whirlpool churning angry muddy foam in
the craggy rocks around the mouth of the
rushing flooded tunnel the eyes of the
camp followed him he stood for a long
moment staring into the water tal saw
captain tomahawk



his shoulders raise and fall as if in resig-
nation then without warning and with
a wild derisive cry he plunged into that
deadly welter of raging water

vii

for a moment hastings stood in dazed
astonishment then he broke into a
dead run toward the water carcajou ran
after him caught his arm

  no never-mind son he said swiftly
red john must have figgered wed treat
him like a blackfoot anyhow we wont
have to be feedin him and postin guard
if he wanted to go that bad let him aint
ary man could live through the beatin hell
get in that channel

  carcajous certainty eased some of the
self-blame from tals shoulders it was
of prime importance that john mcfairn
be taken out of circulation through the
north country it was in fact of minor
importance whether he was a prisoner or
dead tal had beeen unwilling to see the
man in discomfort in the driving rain and
had offered him what freedom there was
while the channel was blocked now-if
the rouge did make it to the outside-all
hell would break loose and the secret
of le havre would be known to the ene-
mies of the brotherhood he swung to-
ward the motionless press of men at his
back and singled satane out

  get five men that can read trail-sign
you and carcajou and me will take them
out soons the water drops well find
mcfairn and bury him deep

  satane stared at the whirlpool slowly
he shook his head

  mebbeso we don find a dead man
msieu he said softly the rouge is
wan brave feller he is plenty strong and
big like the ox mebbeso we find only
tracks tracks going nort

  tal laughed shortly ready to dismiss
peres forebodings as part of the old mans
dour nature but mili pulled at him

  listen to pere mon ami she urged
listen close i know of a man who went
out with the water through that tunnel
one time and he was unhurt the girl
paused pere knows i was caught on
those rocks in the last flood he tried to
reach me and was caught in the current
hours later when the water was gone he

came back in through the tunnel his clothes
torn from him and looking like a dead
man but he was untouched

  it was fantastic tal shook his head in
bewilderment if mcfairn had lived
through the maelstrom   

  abel he barked abel stone satane
and carcajou and myself are taking five
men with us to pick up the rouges carcass
or track him down but he might be alive
and give us the slip we cant take any
chances after the warning i gave him
ed molinell be shipping his furs out of
fort national as quickly as he can theres
a lot of stolen free-trade pelts in those
bales too weve got to have them you
take every other available man and head
for fort national keep well south till
youre past the center of the basin so you
wont meet up with four men then drive
right on to the post and hit hard get the
furs and get back here

  a wide grin creased stones face a
pleasure at being chosen leader of an at-
tacking force carcajou took off his sag-
ging cap and wrung the water from it with
a disgusted look at the sky

  getting lighter he said glumly but
well have to wait till night afore that
channels open and look boy dont
worry about abel meeting up with four
men mcfairn shot off his mouth a mite
to me trackin back in from the pass after
wed took him appears he promised four
men sixty rifles outn his stock at fort
benedict ifn the blackfeet would throw
a line between here and his fur shipment
to keep us off him till he made the pass
and was floatin on the sweetwater he
was plenty upset wed took him prisoner
said nobody at his post knew about his
deal with the indians and that if four
men didnt get his guns the blackfeetd
wipe benedict out i got a hunch four
mens already started north to do that
you know how a indian is when he thinks
hes been cheated

  tal hoped shane was right it would
help matters considerably to have the woods
cleared of the red devils if they were forced
to look very far for mcfaims body ot
sign of the man but time was passing
and if the anglican factor had lived through
the water he was already on his way north
impatiently tal watched the thinning clouds
above le havre
	frontier

less than an hour out of le havre
satane and carcajou uncovered sign
on the bank of the poposia that red john
mcfairn had escaped death in the water-
filled tunnel he was apparently without
moccasins likely half-naked after the pum-
meling of the water minutes later where
four men had set his ambush the day
before they found a dead indian likely
killed in the brush with tals feinting-party
on the river the indian had been stripped
of all his gear his moccasins and his leg-
gings therefore the sign mcfairn left
behind him was of an uncommonly large
and heavy blackfoot traveling swiftly into
the north

  without equipment certainly stiff and
battered after his experience it was a
source of astonishment to tal that the big
factor managed to stay always ahead of
his own racing party but the sign was
always cold and mcfairn was always ahead
the chase lasted for six endless days
in which the broad northland reeled past
like an endless green carpet stitched with
swift rivers and wrinkled by the hills
they reached benedict in the middle of
the sixth night eight weary men who had
trailed a grim red ghost five hundred des-
perate miles

  it was obvious the factor had returned
and that he expected pursuit the great
main gate of the imposing fort was closed
and sentries were at firing-posts at each cor-
ner it was also fairly certain that having
reached his own base in safety and in pos-
session of information about the force and
location of the brotherhood mcfairn
would set immediately about making plans
to wipe them out having come this far
tal wanted to know what these plans were
he had a sapling cut back in the timber
from the post and notched along its length
to serve as a crude scaling-ladder

  sending satane and the other five around
to the front face of benedict to make a
false attack against the face carcajou and
himself crept as close as they dared to
the rear stockade and waited after an
interval satanes men set up a heavy
noisy firing from scattered points in front
of the gate as though a large force was
drawn up there almost immediately the
sentries at the rear watch-boxes dropped
to the inside running toward the fighting
this was the chance throwing their

stories

sapling against the rear wall tal and car-
cajou worked swiftly up its springy length
topped the wall and kicked the sapling
down behind them

  inside the post they split keeping to
shadow each circling along the inner wall
in opposite directions avoiding the post
force whose attention was still held by
the firing along the front tal crept from
room to room watching for mcfaims
great shock of hair it was slow work
he was less than half of the way around
his circuit when the firing outside ceased
suddenly there was a brief period of
unearthly quiet then a terrible yell rang
out and half a hundred guns opened against
the post tal froze there could be no
mistaking that yell it was the blackfoot
war-cry he was seized with sudden con-
cern for the men under satane beyond the
stockade the wily old padre in spite of
his fits of madness was a soldier likely
enough hed spotted the indians before
they struck and eased his men clear of
them as this fresh attack gained way
tals concern spread to include his own
safety and that of carcajou also still
prowling within the walls the attackers
were boldly hitting full at the main gate
and from his own position across the wide
compound he could see the stout timbers
giving way he started a run across the
open reckless in search of shane at this
moment three things happened

  the gate gave way with a crash and four
mens warriors poured into the post in
their vanguard howling as loud as any
savage celestine was leading a little troop
of his renegade canuks on a firing-
stage half-way up the face of the stock-
ade a great bull-chested figure with flaming
hair appeared roaring commands to the
post garrison and from a door close to
tal a woman ran wildly into the open

  tal saw he couldnt cross the compound
that carcajou would have to make his own
way he saw also that fort benedict
was doomed and he recognized the run-
ning girl even as his arms caught her
anne moline there wasnt time to think
there wasnt time to talk he barked one
stabbing order at the white face in front
of him

  grab by belt and stick behind me
quick

  my father the girl cried out tal
captain tomahawk	

barked the single word once more so force-
fully the girl wilted and hooked her hands
into his belt at the back

  quick

  turning he drove through the shadows
at a full run anne moline fighting to
keep her feet at that pace as he passed
the posts forge he snatched up a woods-ax
and raced on to the rear wall as he ran
along the stockade his hands brushed the
upright tree-trunks of which it was fash-
ioned when he came to two which were
smaller than the rest and set together he
swung his ax the wood seemed backed
with iron great chips flew from his light-
ning strokes but the hole he was slabbing
out bit slowly sweat poured from him
and his breath came in great sobs in
moments some of the blackfeet or celes-
tines men would see that winking ax and
death would be swift he still lacked
inches from being through the wall and
his arms were lead when a quick-strong
hand tore the ax from his grip and sent
it smashing with renewed vigor against
the wood in seconds the hole was through
he doubled the girl forward saw her
through the opening felt himself thrust
roughly after her outside a huge figure
straightened beside him

  i got one of em son grab the gals
other hand and run run like hell for
the timber

  tal sucked in a great breath carcajou
they raced forward in reaching strides
dragging anne moline between them

viii

half an hour later the scattered band
from le havre stood on a little
knoll a quarter of a mile into the timber
from fort benedict satane had gotten
his men away from the post-four of them
pere himself had been shot through with
a rifle-ball but he scorned the seriousness
of it saying that it would wait until mili
could tend it at le havre through a
break in the timber the anglican post was
in full view lighted by the flames licking
high over it a few moments after satanes
little company came straggling up where
tal and carcajou and anne moline already
stood the girl gave a startled cry

  look

  tal jerked his head around fire had

jumped to the roof of the main building

of the doomed fort at the edge of the
roof high above a compound packed with
blackfoot and renegade wolves a solitary
figure crouched firing one after another
of a stack of guns at his elbow into the
press below there could be no mistaking
the bulk of the man and in the fire-glow
his hair gleamed like flame itself even
as the little company on the knoll watched
red mcfairn came to the end of his weap-
ons and stood upright shaking his fist in
malevolent defiance a long feathered
war-lance arched up from the compound
in graceful flight the rouge made no
attempt to dodge the weapon

  transfixed by the graceful shaft he
stood yet a moment longer silhouetted by
the fire then he staggered backward
across the roof and plunged through the
rafters at a place where the flames had
eaten through the shingles a geyser of
sparks shot up from the place where he
fell tal hastings turned slowly away it
was a fitting end for a fighter-friend or
enemy

  tal felt a sudden touch

  carcajou tugged at his arm pulling him
apart from the rest

  you should have gone the way i did
in that post he said i found what you
were looking for son mcfairns office
red john and ab moline and a young
brass-buttons from fort laramie that red
john called cowan in a corner was old
jean blanchard mcfairns boss they
had him tied and they were tellin him
what all in hell they were going to do in
this country-the three of them together
they were runnin the free-trade out and
takin blanchards post away from him
they were keepin more trappers from
cornin up the river from the territories
everyone of em had a piece of the plan
an the only one that seemed unhappy about
it was ab moline i think youre right in
what you said that molines half crazy

  easy tal said jerking his head to-
ward the girl thats molines daughter

  shanes eyebrows climbed no won-
der shes carryin on mebbe i better tell
her i seen him tal shrugged following
carcajou back toward the others but
carcajous information about ab moline
was outdated the wounded pere satane
was talking to the girl
	frontier

  oui mamselle pere know msieu mo-
line when he see him i do not make the
mistake in five minutes after the indians
come he slip out a little side gate with a
soldier msieu moline he dont want to
go i tink he want to look for you but
the soldier he make plenty trouble and
in a little bit they are run quick for the
timber then i don see them again

  anne moline spun to tal you hear
that she said eagerly dad he es-
caped quick lets get on the trail we
can overtake him

  tal nodded not that he agreed wholly
with the girl but with celestine joined
with four men it was a reasonable bet
that the wolves which were destroying fort
benedict would strike next at le havre
closer than molines post at fort national

it was imperative then that le havre
be warned and manned immediately there
would be no time to search for moline
and lieutenant jack cowan anne moline
would be safe with the brotherhood for
the time being at least as safe as mili
was and it would do jackie cowan a
lot of good to fight his way through the
timber of this north country with an insane
man for a partner

  hastings was concerned about satanes
wound but pere laughed at him and tal
was forced to take what consolation he
could from the fact they had only fifteen
miles of footwork until they came to where
they had left their canoes on a tributary
of the yellowstone

they reached le havre after a week
in which they were dogged by bad
luck they missed the canoes and had to
cut back for them running a bad rapids
anne moline became alarmed and shifted
in her seat rolling the canoe which tal
was poising so carefully into the water a
day later an old beaver-dam which must
have been of huge size let go somewhere
above them the river ran a dangerous
crest and behind it came logs and stumps
and debris too menacing for a heavily-
loaded canoe to ride they were forced
to haul out until the crest was past and
the water clear

  behind them pressed the blackfeet and
celestines renegades twice from camps
on high land they could see the fires of the
pursuit behind them added to this was

 stories

the fact that even satane had ceased to
laugh over his wound it had stiffened
him on the second day as the hours
passed it grew more angry and inflamed
more and more often satane spoke of mili
and le havre and the last two days
he lay for the most part delirious calling
out the girls name with a heart-stabbing
insistence

  hastings knew that he should lay up
and tend to the wound giving it a day
or so of rest but he couldnt nor was
there point in landing say himself and
satane and letting the others go on it
would be no help to the wounded man to
save him the rigors of travel only to let
him fall into the hands of the wolves
behind

  it was with deep relief that he turned
the canoes into the landing-place close to
the entrance to le havre mili was wait-
ing for them apparently having watched
their approach from the lookout she ran
forward eagerly but when she saw anne
moline step from a canoe clinging to tals
arm she stopped short her face clouding
tal made an awkward introduction ig-
noring anne pointedly and haughtily mili
sepped close to tal

  you learn quick about the north she
said in shoshone already you take
squaws when you go on the war-path

  she turned then and started away tal
ran after her caught her roughly

  when i take a squaw girl he said
sharply youll know about it peres
been hurt hell be needing you

  milis face went white she ran swiftly
down to the waters edge where carcajou
and one of the others were lifting the
wounded trapper ashore in a moment she
was back

  well have to make a stretcher to carry
him and ill want the cabin clear theres
a man in it now i took him prisoner
yesterday hes been demanding to see
you

  she turned away abruptly

  seeing that carcajou and the two girls
could take care of satane and that the rest
of the crew would bring in the gear tal
went on alone through the tunnel he
found milis prisoner very thoroughly
bound in a corner of the cabin the man
turned his head as tal entered it was
bill starrett
captain tomahawk	

  hastings starrett gasped thank
god youre here i thought youd be too
late and that black-eyed little devil that
dragged me in here wouldnt give me any
satisfaction who is she

  the best legionnaire in le havre tal
said gently loosing starretts hands now
what the thunder you doing up here i
figured youd be in laramie with the
troop

  i would if the troop had stayed in
laramie hastings the army man said
ruefully reckon im plain deserted but
so damn much happened and i figured you
ought to know so i broke camp and
worked this way hoping to the devil id
run across you that gal saw me from
her lookout and leveled a rifle at me down
river a ways

  tal sat down his brows ridged start
slow and at the beginning and let me have
it

  sure i left fort national the morning
after anne and me turned you loose there
when i got to laramie i told lieutenant
cowan id seen you and what you said
about keeping the troop out of the north
he dismissed me and started to read ab
molines letter and hour later general
quarters was sounded and he ordered us
into trail-kits and marching gear he
drove us all the way to fort national
when we got there we found that moline
and anne had gone north further to mc-
fairns post cowan like to threw a fit
at that i heard him telling daggett our
quartermaster and second in command
that he was being double-crossed he
pulled out the same day alone for fort
benedict ordering daggett to hold us at
molines post until he got back

  that night all hell hit fort national
bunch of pirates so the talk went any
rate they broke in a side gate turned loose
the heaviest firing i ever saw from one
little bunch of men and cleaned out mo-
lines fur-rooms to the last pelt the
troop backed up by molines men shot
the hell out of them but they got away
it was as bold and pretty a piece of work
as i ever hope to see put daggett in a
hell of a fix finally molines men raised
such a ruckus about their furs that dag-
gett acted on a basis that united states
soldiers had been fired on and ordered the
troop out after them

  we marched inside a couple of hours
and close on their tracks i know youd
want to know the troop was moving this
way and i had an idea that bunch that
we were trailing were your men so i
broke ranks when i got a chance hit the
timber and pushed on as fast as i could
i passed the raiders night before last dont
know how much i gained on them after
that but theyll be here any time now
with the troop right behind them 

  tal took starretts hand gripped it
solidly i owe you something for this
he said gratefully weve got a wounded
man coming in here give me a hand with
this cabin then well call a palaver
but in the end hastings didnt call his
council there was no question of what
should be done and nothing to discuss the
thing he had come into the north to avoid
was about to happen if four mens vic-
tory-maddened blackfeet met that trail-
weary little troop of cavalry afoot now
and under a green junior officer everything
that had happened before would have been
wasted when pere was bunked down in
the cabin to milis satisfaction and he was
sure there was nothing more to be done
for the old trapper for the time being tal
called carcajou

  get together all the men that mili can
spare leave here enough to give her a
hand with satane see the horns are full
and theres shot in the pouches

  shane shook his head wearily were
goin out agin and with them blackfeet
rollin south as fast as they can come
were going out to meet them tal
said flatly were going to give em hell
abels on his way back with his bunch
shot to the devil but loaded down with
molines fur we got to keep the entrance
to le havre open for him and the sol-
diers are right on his tail weve got to
keep those brass buttons from tangling with
four men

  carcajou shrugged his eyes twinkling
ever hear a gent boast he dont get enough
of fighting ill sure as hell know who to
send him to after this

  minutes later loaded and grim-faced
half a dozen men filed out of le havre
leaving behind them a wounded man and
two women both mili and anne moline
had scorned masculine help with their
patient when guns were so bady needed

when he reached the river tal split
his men carcajou bill starrett and
himself were to work down one side of
the river the other three were to take
the far bank

  therell be upward of fifty blackfeet
and a dozen of celestines canuks theres
only six of us but theyll be in canoes
watching for our landing-place i dont
expect us to turn them but we can slow
them up for a spell abel and his boys
are due in from fort national any min-
ute soon as they show milill send them
out here well have enough guns to do
some good with then but weve got to
stall this attack till they get here the
first six canoes that pass you boys on the
far side take empty them as clean as you
can the next six well take stagger it
that way if they land give ground and
dig in a new place upriver

  the six of them parted every man
knew what he was facing and how the odds
stacked but an eagerness was on every
face watching them tal felt a surge of
pride when the other three had reached
the far bank he started forward with car-
cajou and starrett beside him in twenty
minutes a whistle sounded on the far bank
and in a moment a fleet of canoes dark-
ened the silver sheen of the river squat-
ting in the brush nerves tight as
bow-strings they waited canoes began to
pass when the sixth one had cleared
flame stabbed from the far bank havoc
suddenly fell among the paddlers in the
first craft the guns spoke again and the
second canoe overturned then the second
section of six was abreast and tals fingers
curled about his own trigger

  for five minutes they poured a two-sided
fire into the confusion among the canoes
then four men was up in the lead scream-
ing at his men untangling them and swing-
ing many of the canoes ashore answering
fire grew stronger five canoes landed a
few rods below where tal and his com-
panions crouched it was time to move
he half-raised as he did so carcajou
pointed to a canoe in close to the bank
being driven back downstream by two pad-
dlers propped in the bow was a white
man

  jean blanchard carcajou whispered

tal slid toward the water blanchard was
a big man in the north or in the whole
country and his reputation for honesty
and fair dealing was as widespread as the
holdings of his anglican fur company
tal saw it as part of his job to save the
old mans skin plunging into the river
waist deep he waded swiftly out toward
the canoe the two blackfoot paddlers all
that remained of a large crew turned des-
perately one raised a rifle and fired it
point-blank at tal he felt the slug hit
shaking him but in a moment he had the
gunwhale of the canoe and bill starrett
ashore had cleaned out the two indians

  the firing drew fresh attention when
four mens braves saw that their prisoner
was escaping them they threw a wall of
lead against the bank careless now whether
blanchard was killed or not so long as
those reaching for him were hit but fan-
tastic luck built up about the three men
beaching the canoe half submerged in
water they were poor targets they
worked the canoe into a place where brush
overhung the water and lifted the old man
from where he lay a swift knife cut his
bonds he came unsteadily to his feet
starrett and carcajou shane each got a
shoulder under his arms with tal break-
ing the way they dropped hurriedly back
from the river and worked upstream be-
hind them the firing died out

  a quarter of a mile above where they
had first struck an owl hooted on the far
bank the call was repeated cupping
his hands carcajou sent a passable imita-
tion back in answer

  the other boys he said shortly just
lettin us know we was opposite em and
set for another brace against them red
devils

  no sign of stone and his boys tal
grunted carcajou spat and dropped a
ball into his rifle ahead of the ramrod

  ifn abel was in a couple of miles and
heard that owl hed a done what i did
youd a thought this was owl heaven for all
the birds in it abel just aint showed
boy thats all i

  moments later the brush rattled behind
them tal jerked his gun up centering
something less than a shadow leaping across
a little open a man threw up his hands
and landed heavily tals shot drew a
vicious answering fire centering on the
captain tomahawk



flash of his gun lead winged sharply
into the brush where he crouched with the
others carcajou swore sharply tal
jerked his head around

  damn splinter offn a saplin in my
neck shane whispered hurt thatg
all

  tal thought about his own wound it
pulled at his left arm heavily apparently
a hole through the muscle just outside his
upper ribs he saw that starrett was
fingering a wet place on the sleeve of his
uniform the brush crackled again and
carcajou fired another man went down
across the river a stray shot snapped out
and a blackfoot screamed his peculiar high
death-cry

  they were making their lead count but
there werent enough of them and there
wasnt enough lead

he shifted position moving up with
carcajou and starrett still piloting
old blanchard he waited a little longer
hoping to hear a rallying call from up the
river but it didnt come shrugging
finally he spoke in carcajous ear

  we arent magicians he snapped its
like trying to stop a spring thaw wed
better slide or theyll get us and there
wont be anything between them and those
two girls

  at his side bill starrett breathed a big
sigh i was wondering when youd think
of that he said why i didnt even get
a chance to talk to anne

  let the boys across know if you can
carcajou tal went on

  the old trapper crept down to the water
a moment later the loud slap of a beavers
tail sounded tal had used that signal
himself loosely it meant danger but
the boys across the river would catch on
all right the brush was alive with black-
feet tal grew impatient for carcajous
return but the trapper didnt come back
cautiously tal followed after him a
pair of yards from the river bank he
stopped carcajou was working toward
him behind the king of the woods-run-
ners an overturned canoe lay on the wet
shingle and over its upper edge two
pairs of legginged legs were dangling
carcajou thrust a long wide-bladed knife
into tals hand

  last time you saw it it was agin my

belly he said grimly its celestines
take it back to mili

  tal doubled back toward where he had
left starrett and jean blanchard carca-
jou stayed silently beside him when he
spoke again his voice was almost sound-
less

  celestine and one of his renegades had
that canoe in the bush right beside me when
i made that signal on- the water they
jumped me quick all right but im a mite
nervous tonight its possible neither one
knowed jest where the knife that got em
come from i got a notion four menll
find them outlaw voyaguers wont stick to
him now a renegade of any breeds got
to have a leader or hell run like hell
tals lips parted grimly carcajou had
a thorough way of paying off a score it
was good to know too that celestine was
out of the way it made the count a little
less top-heavy for six men his party
had done what it could

  break for the tunnel he breathed
and make it fast

  for a few minutes it looked as if the
blackfeet had them circled across the
river the three on the far bank had to
shoot themselves out of a corner plunging
into the water in a churning reckless cross-
ing but they made it and in moments
the seven of them were running together
toward the clump of brush which hid le
havres gate not far behind them but
still on the river the battle-fired warriors
of four mens band were keeping in deadly
pursuit tal leaped ahead to jerk the brush
aside over the tunnel opening and rammed
full onto the muzzles of a pair of rifles in
the hands of two troopers of the united
states cavalry at sentry-go in the tunnel
mouth

tals momentum carried him hard
against the guns with swift down-
striking hands heswept one of the bar-
rels to each side of him plowing on be-
tween the two surprised troopers at the
same instant one of the two fired his
piece tal felt the sear of its charge along
his thigh then he laced out with his fist
tagged the point of a jaw and dropped
his man carcajou came in from the side
his great long arms wrapping the other
	frontier stories

sentry tight bill starrett jerked the mans
belt-gun and laid him beside his fellow
with a quick sure pass of the short barrel

  scattered sporadic firing echoed down
the tunnel from the bowl of le havre it
was plain what was afoot weary and
hard-pressed abel stone had reached the
hideout with his stolen furs with the cav-
alry troop right behind him they had
plunged on through the tunnel leaving
these sentries behind to wipe out the pi-
rates they had chased so far the fact
that they had finally overtaken the wily
woods-wise stone was evidence that dag-
gett the quartermaster commanding in
jackie cowan absence was a better officer
than cowan had ever been tal smiled
grimly there were many things he had
learned in his weeks in the north but
few of them brought him the satisfaction
this item did he drew his tiny crew close
in the end of the tunnel

  make all the hell you can when we
hit the bowl ahead he snapped sound
like seventy instead of seven burn plenty
of powder but throw your shots wide
dont tag any of the troopers unless they
turn on us well need them weve got
them from behind now and abels likely
across the bowl behind the cabin maybe
we can make them think theyre caught in
a trap

  the weary men at tals back seemed to
find fresh energy from hidden reservoirs
old jean blanchard snatched up the rifle
of one of the downed sentries when they
had raced the length of the tunnel and
belched out into le havres bowl he was
howling like a drunken piegan the up-
roar issuing without warning from the
sounding-board of the tunnel struck the
line of soldiers advancing cautiously across
the bowl like an unexpected artillery bar-
rage some of them wheeled and dropped
defensively the majority froze where
they stood caught short and waiting for
a command at their head two men jerked
around almost at the same instant star-
rett and tal both grunted identification of
one of them

  cowan

  the other was ed moline tals mind
stabbed this development into the swiftly-
forming pattern of events moline and
jackie cowan working south after their
escape from the destruction of fort bene-

dict must have stumbled into the troop
under the quartermaster somewhere out
in the basin it made matters a little dif-
ferent to have cowan back in command
being implicated with moline and the dead
mcfairn in their wild plan for an empire
in the fur country the discredited officer
was apt to be desperate ordering his men
to make a stand against any odds

  but tal was reasoning without the strain
to which cowan had been subject on his
flight south with the wild-eyed moody mo-
line drawing his saber and reversing it
s that he could hold its hilt high in plain
sight he screamed at his own men and
tals party alike

  down guns we surrender truce
firing died tal held his men back un-
til abels larger party from the upper end
of the bowl had moved down among the
soldiers then he swung his few forward
the danger of exposing their small number
past abel stones men made quick work
of disarming cowan and ed moline from
the cabin in the center of the bowl two
girls ran swiftly the first was anne mo-
line running brokenly toward the knot
of men about her father bill starrett
angled across to shoulder a way through
the press for her the other was mili
racing across the uneven ground like a
deer her raven hair trailing unnoticed be-
hind her her face white with concern

  tal saw old jean blanchard drop the
gun in his hand and start forward then
apparently seeing the look on the girls
face and the concern in her eyes the old
fur-lord fell back mili came on her arms
out in unashamed eagerness tal ab-
sorbed her rush sweeping her close to
him

  tal tal she sobbed pressing her-
self tighter in his arms as if her intensity
could tell him of fears and relief she
couldnt voice she felt him flinch where
her shoulder touched the wound along his
ribs the sobs died and she jerked back
cher ami you are killed

  a small grin parted tals lips not
yet little one he said softly im still
on my feet

  oh life flowed back into the girl
with that sigh

  hows pere  time was running short
tal spoke swiftly

  mili shook her head
captain tomahawk	

  but he hangs on tal he wants to
see you-after the guns are quiet

  but a little while then girl tell him
to keep hanging on itll be over shortly

  mili turned back to the cabin tal raised
his voice calling for abel stone carcajou
and bill starrett starrett he sent among
the troopers with orders to get them up
on the slopes to either side of the tunnel
in open shooting such as was coming in
the bowl of le havre the cavalry would
be far from the helpless men they were
out in the deep timber stone he sent to
round up the brotherhood and brace them
at the upper end of le havre carcajou
and himself took corners of the cabin ready
to turn the blackfeet away from the two
women the two prisoners and the
wounded men who were within it

  all of these things took brief moments
which ran together into quick flash of
time then a roar came out of the tun-
nel and after it the red relentless tide of
four mens warriors they poured into
the bowl widened and bounded forward
toward the position taken up by abel
stones command as the last of them
loped out of the tunnel a squad of the
troopers dropped down closing off their
escape a party of them headed by four
men himself ran sharply toward the cabin
in the center of the open it was like the
wily old chief to realize that in this shelter
were the things his enemy wanted most to
protect

  knowing the old piegan chief to be a
reasonable man and knowing his power
over his band tal was unwilling to shoot
him down without giving him his chance
motioning carcajou to cover the far side
in case some of the rest circled he stepped
clear of the cabin and flung his hands up
in quick chopping sign-language call for
truce and parley four men stopped for
a moment in indecision then pressed
from behind by his younger men he leaped
forward again throwing up his rifle as he
ran

the weapon blossomed flame tal felt
the hard slam of the slug as it touched
his shoulder in passing he pulled the
trigger of the hand-gun he held ready
four men ran half a dozen paces more
dropped his rifle stumbled and rolled al-
most to tals feet at the upper end of

the bowl stone gave an order and a ter-
rible volley of lead swept le havre that
happened twice leaderless the blackfeet
wheeled like a drilled company and raced
toward the tunnel but starrett and the
troopers were ready a wall of fire
smashed into the indians turning them
they made another wild dash trying to
cut through the pall of powdersmoke hang-
ing like a curtain before the tunnel-mouth
then a secondary chief threw down his
rifle the blackfeet followed to a man
and firing ceased in the little haven as
swiftly as it had begun

  wearily tal turned toward the door of
the cabin pere had wanted to see him
when the guns were silent mili opened
the door she spoke sharply to the two
prisoners anne moline took her fathers
arm guiding him to the door as cowan
stepped into the open following them bill
starrett appeared at tals elbow and
glanced inquiringly toward the cowed
white-faced officer tal nodded

  name a police detail and put him under
arrest corporal he said quietly star-
retts heels came together sharply his
hand clipped the side of his hatless head

  yes sir

  tal stepped into the cabin mili caught
up his hand led him across to where pere
satane lay on a bunk one look at the
old voyaguers face was enough there
was nothing in it now even the flush of
raging fever was gone only his eyes were
alive and the shadows of the divide were
gathering in their depths there is little
a man can say to a dying friend tal lifted
satanes hand a faint pressure ran
through the limp fingers

  the last trail mon ami the trapper
breathed now i go back to the book

i	trow away no matter pere is lak
the she-wolf with her back broke she
stay wit her cubs till they are weaned
then she crawl in the hole and she die
long tam i wait for milis beau  brave
long tam i make prayer voila you
come is finish now 

  satane caught his breath for a mo-
ment longer his eyes held to tals face
seeming to pass on with their fading look
his devotion to the girl he had stolen from
the blackfeet tals arm slid around milis
shoulders the breath eased from satane
and he was dead tal turned mili walked
	frontier

slowly with her to the door carcajou met
them there

  ive got four men propped up around
the corner tal shane said urgently and
he wants to make palaver

  moving stiffly aware of his wounds and
in crying need of rest tal rounded the
cabin with mili at his side the oldpiegan
chief was braced up in state five or six
of his younger aides were at his feet bill
starrett and anne moline stopd a little
distance away old jean blanchard was
crouched close to four men the indian
waved a feeble hand to mili beckoning her
close beside him tal followed

  old men must talk before they can
die four men said slowly the years
weigh down their souls with many things
hear me when i was a young war-
maker the first whites came among us in
their search for furs i saw in my minds
eye a coming time when there would be
many whites and no redmen when that
time came my nation must fight or make
a shrewd trade therefore i took a party
to the lodge of the greatest of the fur-
men and stole a girl-child from him i
kept her many years against the day when
the fur man and the chief of the blackfeet
met in parley i kept her as a hostage for
the land the whites would take from my
people

  three seasons past she was stolen from
me by a woods-runner who kept her as his
own daughter four men made many at-
tempts to take her back and failed now
the blackfoot nation is defeated and their
chief dies four men desires to return the
girl to the lodge of her father-here

  the old indians hand reached out stab-
bing a finger at jean blanchard the
owner of the great anglican company came
slowly to his feet puzzled tremulous
mili also stood up blanchard took her
hand

  daughter he said hoarsely then he
was more gentle carefully holding in check
the strong emotion pulling at his face
ive known since i first saw you mili
blanchard

  watching the two of them tal saw that
he too should have known the strong
clear-cut features and the devil-fired jet
eyes were common to them both mili
went to the old man with uncertain eager-
ness needing his comfort to fill the void

stories

left by the death of pere satane from
blanchards arms she sent a blinding happy
smile across to tal the anglican owner
spoke again

  now i want the ears of everyone
presently i will have words for four
mens blackfeet but first for the broth-
erhood gathered here there are many
things i know first i heard late last
fall whispers of a scheme of lawless em-
pire in these woods one of my posts
fort benedict was involved my factor
was apparently a ring-leader i appealed
to the army of the united states they
agreed to send their detachment at fort
laramie out to investigate i protested
that the detachment was too small and un-
trained in woods-war i protested that
the young pig-headed junior lieutenant in
command at laramie appeared to be a
party to my factors plans the army
told me they had no other force available
but that they would send one man into
the north i laughed but i laughed too
soon gentlemen that man was captain
tallant hastings

the eyes of the whole company swung
toward tal some in amazement some
in pleasure corporal starrett grinned
knowing pride and tightened his grip around
anne molines shoulders tal was un-
comfortable blanchard seemed to sense
this

  captain hastings chose to gather the
free-trade to break up this threatening em-
pire he was wise enough to know that
only the trappers themselves would be able
to defeat the forces moving against them
the brotherhood of le havre will be long
remembered for with it the captain has
been able to win a peace for us all even
for the blackfeet he stopped turning
to carcajou tell four men that i have
many posts but that his people have only
one hunting-ground i am going down-
river with my daughter when captain
hastings returns lieutenant cowan to
leavenworth for trial i will probably
return alone but ill not rebuild fort
benedict the territory once controlled by
that post i give to the piegan chief in re-
turn for my daughter

  carcajou translated blanchards words
to four men with a stiff-necked dignity
which implied it was he carcajou shane
letter to a po-w

will you write a letter to a prisoner
of war    tonight

 perhaps he was left behind when
bataan fell perhaps he had to bail out
over germany anyway hes an amer-
ican and he hasnt had a letter in a
long long time

and when you sit down to write tell
him why you didnt buy your share of
war bonds last pay day-if you didnt
dear joe you might say the
old topcoat was getting kind of
threadbare so i   

no cross it out joe might not under-
stand about the topcoat especially if

hes shivering in a damp japanese cell

   lets try again dear joe ive been
   working pretty hard and havent had
   a vacation in over a year so  

better cross that out too they dont
ever get vacations where joes staying

  well what are you waiting for go
ahead write the letter to joe try to
write it anyhow

   but if somehow you find you cant will

share of war bonds from here on in

	frontier

woods-runner who made this generous
treaty four mens eyes kindled but his
face was graven

  it is a good land my people are grate-
ful the piegan is a worthy enemy he
is a better friend so long as honor lives
among us there will be peace in the north-
land

  tal hastings stirred a heavy weight
slid from his shoulders he smiled and
started toward mili and her father no
history book would ever record this peace
it was without formality without foolscap
ink and quill but it would hold with the
most impressive in following years when
the expanding nation reached into the north
and government came with it statesmen
would write a new treaty at oak tables
yet when the new was written it would
hold nothing not already sworn to here

  carcajou shane shuffled into his path

  damn he said with mock bitterness
ive lived half a life on the practice that
a dead blackfoot was somethin to be proud
of i was plumb enjoyin watchin that old
devil four men fadin out like a wet fire
then blanchard give him that land and
he right quick started burnin agin hell
be on his feet in a week and ill have
to git me a new mark to practice my shoot-
in-eye on there aint a crooked bone in
that old piegans body what he says
hell stick to be no sport in meetin a
blackfoot on a trail no more

  tal grinned slapped carcajous shoul-
der with the affection of a man who has
been through a high-water hell with an-
other bill starrett and anne moline came
up before he left the old trapper

  think i might get a discharge from the
service capn starrett asked

  tal looked from the trooper to the girl
and back again his eyes danced

  for good cause possibly he agreed

  starrett missed the humor in his eager-
ness ive got that-anne weve got

stories

to get her father out of the north and down
on the big river where he can rest up and
get free of the strain thats cracked him
we aim to find a preacher down there
then we want to come back to fort na-
tional and run it right we want to give
up keeping it a strictly yankee company
post thought wed widen out and open it
to the free-traders they take more fur
than company men any day and fur is a
traders business

  tal saw carcajous seamed face split
into a wide grin the free-trade was to
have a post in the north that meant
something to the disbanding brotherhood
tal nodded to starrett

  you and carcajou get together and sort
out the take we brought in here blanchard
wont want any part of those bales we
took from mcfairn thatll give- you a
good start you might put shane in charge
of your post till you got back hed have
it purring like a big cat for you when you
and anne came up-river

  anne moline nodded itll take time to
get father well to cure his mind we may
be delayed a season i had thought of
mister shane if he would  

  if he would carcajou shouted
mam give me room im an old moun-
tain-man with a belly full of war and a
hankerin to settle down

  tal drew away mili saw him coming
and moved out to meet him

  capitaine it is now eh she teased
maybe when i am an old woman i will
like that but for now you will be always
by my boucanier my fur-pirate

  together they walked down toward the
little river which ran through le havre
they said nothing more presently mili
began to sing

       some are dead young-

       some are dead old-

         we live forever   

 will they be missing fir action there 
 because rou failed in actiok here act now
