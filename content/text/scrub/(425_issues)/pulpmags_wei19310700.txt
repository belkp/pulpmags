with this issue weird tales returns to a monthly basis this number goes
on the news stands june st the august issue will be on sale july st the mag-
azine will be issued regularly every month thereafter our announcement in last
issue that the magazine would again be published every thirty days has called forth a
chorus of congratulations from you the readers and we find that weird tales is
the favorite magazine of many thousands

    a letter from ted fox of new haven connecticut says i was overjoyed to
learn that you have decided to return to monthly publication i very definitely had
missed the thrills and quakings engendered by reading your periodical i had a
sneaking suspicion that your cutting down the number of issues was actuated by your
being unable to find sufficient material of your high literary standard but the
april-may number has convinced me that this is not the case the dead-alive is
as artistic as eery a yarn of the occult as has ever entertained me with cold shivers for
a delicious half-hour especially well done was the scene between the hero and the
body of his father that left me with a cold sweat the dust of death your fea-
tured story rather disappointed not that it was not a good yarn but that one expeas
the superlative of the featured narrative in weird tales are we to have no more
of seabury quinn there is something missing in a w t without jules de gran-
dins gallic exuberance certainly there will be many more stories of jules de
grandin in future issues-the editors

    from mexico city alice ianson writes as was to be expected my favorite
story in the april-may issue is a rendezvous in averoigne it is a gem of fantasy
beautifully worded dreamily weird soul-thrilling and satisfying i hope there are
many others to follow like this and the end of the story

    writes b a balkin of los angeles i have just laid down your recent issue
and had to rush to my typewriter to tell you that the dead-alive by messrs
schachner and zagat is positively the masterpiece of all weird creepy stories it goes
immediately to the top of anything you have ever printed i assure you i wont be
able to sleep tonight after that thriller ill be seeing ghastly faces at my window
like oliver twist i want more

    the may issue was great writes jack darrow not so many stories but they
were long ones and i like long stories sticking its neck above the rest is the dust

of death by hugh jeffries an excellent science-fiction story next comes ten
million years ahead by edmond hamilton ill never tire of reading his stories

    from toppenish washington mrs grace penfield writes one story in your
april-may issue has brought me the urge to write to you it is a rendezvous in
averoigne by clark ashton smith to me the perfect weird tale must ring true and
must be weird to the nth degree this story fills both bills the writer tells a tale
in such a manner that you feel it all the way through and having some of the good
old irish banshee-believing blood in my veins truth to tell he had me almost believing
it even though he relates the end of the sieur du malinbois and his chatelaine
sure an youll never catch me in the wood of averoigne at all at all i am looking
forward to more by this author

    robert leonard russell of mount vernon illinois writes to the eyrie i am
very glad to see that you have had the good sense to comply with the readers wishes
in changing w t back to a monthly it really should be a semi-monthly or a
weekly i am also pleased to note that you have a newlovecraft story ready for the
near future he wastes a good idea for a story in each section of his monthly poetry
column fungi from yuggoth i am glad that you will again publish serials in
w t serials are the backbone of any good magazine but you should have a de
grandin story in each issue lately you have not your recent covers are punk we
do not want portrait studies of insidious orientals monster boas and dinosaurs
what we want is action pictures pictures of scenes in the story since some of the
blue-nosed censors have kicked about nudes in your illustrations they have been cut
out entirely i say that nudes are all right when needed to illustrate a certain
scene

    a letter from mrs george f hatton jr of battle creek michigan says
the best news i have heard in a long time is your decision to resume monthly pub-
lication i thought those two-month stretches between issues were the longest id
ever experienced i have been a reader of your very entertaining magazine for the
past six years and i would surely forego any other magazine except weird tales i
wouldnt even attempt to pick out all my favorite stories as i wouldnt know where to
stop but i do like your cover designs much more than i formerly did

    writes j wasso jr of pen argyl pennsylvania old w t will again be
a monthly thats the best news in many a moon now please resume the long
pseudo-scientific interstellar serials i would like to see many more stories by love-
craft in weird tales also more torture tales of the type of the chain and the cop-
per bowl

    i am at present rejoicing as are the rest of your readers writes john r small
of washington d c that the monthly schedule is to be resumed in the current
issue a letter from mr william brewster is printed it has annoyed me consider-
ably and i hope you wont take his advice namely to print a magazine that will

howard there is a good deal of excitement in harrisonville but tell mr quinn
its a great place and that if the old frenchman does decide to widen the scope of his
activities to other sectors of the world he will suffer for he will be out of his
element and will not be as well understood elsewhere sergeant costello is familiar
with him and surely there are enough mysteries in good old harrisonville to keep
jules de grandin busy there in my opinion the best story in your last issue was
the dust of death by hugh jeffries the author writes easily clearly and keeps
up the interest throughout his story he has woven it carefully and i for one
congratulate him for a splendid piece of work

    earl morgan of detroit writes to the eyrie i agree with the gentleman
who suggested a small department in which you could tell the readers something
about your authors i for one would like to know something about them i am
perhaps too inquisitive but such questions as these have me curious is seabury
quinn a physician how old is h p lovecraft where does edmond hamilton
live is robert e howard a professor of history at the university of southern cal-
ifornia i have heard he is is greye la spina a man or a woman is nictzin
dyalhis a real or just a book name if it is his real name it is a very pretty-sound-
ing monicker these are just a few of the many questions that i would like an-
swered just a minute until we get our breath and we will try to answer your
questions no seabury quinn is not a physician he is editor of a trade journal
and was formerly a lawyer he was in the intelligence service of the a e f we
do not know how old mr lovecraft is although we have an approximate idea we
suggest that you write him care of weird tales and ask him edmond hamilton
lives in new castle pennsylvania no robert e howard is not a professor of an-
cient history and he lives in texas instead of in california greye la spina is a
woman and a grandmother too although a rather young one nictzin dyalhis is a
real and not a book name the first name is toltec indian his mother came from
guatemala the last name is one of the oldest of english names-the editors
a letter from charles rush jr of new york says allow me to congratulate
you on edmond hamiltons last two tales the horror city and ten million years
ahead what delighted me most in the february-march issue however was that
beautiful story the ghost-helper if seabury quinn keeps that thread of pathos in
his de grandin stories i am sure he will rise to that position in weird literature that
in my estimation is now held by h p lovecraft

    i wish you could induce h p lovecraft to write at least four or five stories for
you each year writes paul s smith of orange new jersey  he is a wonderful
writer and i am sure all the readers have greatly regretted the absence of new
stories by him during the past two years the april-may number of weird tales
was excellent as a whole but to me by far the best thing in this issue is the first
paragraph of the eyrie which states that the magazine will again be published
monthly instead of bi-monthly i have always found it hard to wait one month be-
tween issues but to have to wait two months is a pretty terrible ordeal but now
praise be we are to have it every month again

    dale v simpson of marion ohio writes to the eyrie i am quite overjoyed
to know that lovecraft is to have in another tale the whisperer in darkness
what maleficent ultramondane adumbrations that title brings to ones mind things
from outside    do any of us know that there are not  i certainly hope the
story appears soon the horror from the hills by long is great second only to
the dunwich horror may we have many more from that author by the way
speaking of the dunwich horror i sent my copy of w t containing the story
to a young friend in england he writes me that it is quite one of the best stories he
has ever read it was the first copy of weird tales he had ever seen he said and
wished woolies woolworths would get it in he gets quite a number of amer-
ican magazines at woolworths store in sheffield

    from penn yan new york writes jack t whitfield having received the
latest issue of w t i note with much joy that you have decided to change back to
the old monthly output this is wonderful news and i am confident that every reader
will be elated over your announcement i enjoy greatly most of the stories you pub-
lish though i am not so keen on interplanetary stuff i like stories of chinese torture
vampire and werewolf stories and also those about tropical growths that menace cit-
ies and countries to my mind the big three of your writers are lovecraft long
and quinn i always enjoy each story they turn out lovecraft is the peer of them
all for stark horror his style is perfect and his mode of telling in which the hor-
ror creeps and grows and almost becomes tangible is magnificent

    readers what is your favorite story in this issue the most popular story in
the april-may number as shown by your votes and letters was clark ashton
smiths exquisite vampire story a rendezvous in averoigne not far behind it in
popularity was the dead-alive that thrilling story of corpses that walk in the night

tam son of the tiger 

 by otis adelbert kline

chapter 

the man-eater

burma-land of mystery of gilded
buddhas and almond-eyed danc-
ing-girls of patient elephants pil-
ing teak of shaven yellow-robed priests
smoldering incense and the silver tinkle
of temple bells

the jungle-teeming with tropical life
and potential death

in its upper branches were the feath-
ered inhabitants liquid tones of sweet-
voiced songsters competed with the harsh
raucous cries of parrots and crows flashes
of brightly pigmented plumage contrasted
with the greens and browns of the vegeta-
tion peacocks proudly spread their
painted fans

a little lower monkeys chattered at

spider-limbed gibbons with faces like
little old men a sleek well-fed leopard
basked on a thick limb its mottled hide
blending perfectly with the black and
gold shadows that descended through the
leafy canopy

  and on the forest floor creeping
through the undergrowth with cat-like
stealth was that most cunning and fero-
cious of all jungle creatures-the man-
eating tiger

  the leopard bristled laid back its small
ears and growled softly at sight of the
huge striped terror passing beneath the
monkeys and gibbons heard that growl
and scampered away through the branches
a rusty black crow cocked its head to one
side and stared for a moment with beady
eyes then it uttered a sharp rasping
tam dangled limply from her mouth

caw that plainly said tiger to all
jungle inhabitants the peafowls rose
en masse with a thunderous whir of
wings

and the tiger snarling its anger at this
premature exposure of its presence and
knowing that all concealment was at an
end charged straight for the human be-
ing straggling behind the others which
it had marked for its prey

major charles evans young amer-
ican philanthropist and sportsman
had come to burma with a twofold pur-
pose to gather chaulmoogra seeds for

planting on the hawaiian land which he
had donated to the leper colony at kalau-
papa and to hunt tigers with him were
his wife lucille and his two-year-old son
tam

after a boat trip down the irrawaddy
and up the mu from mandalay they had
come to the village of kyokta near which
it was said the chaulmoogra might be
found scouts under the leadership of
zahn son of the village tapes or head-
man had quickly located several exten-
sive stands of the trees and toward one
of these evans and his wife journeyed
after a night in a kyokta hut they were



weird tales

guided by zahn and his friends who car-
ried baskets for gathering the fruit from
which the seeds were to be later removed
tam had been left at the village in the
care of his colored nurse maid clarabelle
jackson who had accompanied them from
the united states

  zahn proudly marched at the head of
the procession just behind him walked
the american and his wife major evans
was tall broad-shouldered and athletic
he wore high laced boots khaki trousers
a shooting-jacket with large pockets and
a pith helmet beside him walked his
pretty young wife dressed exactly like
her husband but so small and daintily
feminine that even in mannish clothes
there was no mistaking her sex four
villagers who acted as gun-bearers came
behind them carrying two heavy double-
barreled  bury rifles a winchester
and a savage the major had high hopes
of stalking a tiger but not the slightest
suspicion that at that very moment the
striped death was stalking his own party

  following the gun-bearers were a score
of villagers with the baskets and bags
which were to be filled with the fruit of
the chaulmoogra and at the rear trailed
kru muang youthful chum of zahn the
handle of his basket was slung over one
arm and he was using his spear as a staff

  suddenly the boy heard a sharp caw
from a near-by branch followed by the
flapping of startled peafowls a low snarl
and the rush of a heavy body through the
undergrowth behind him

  suar suar he shouted springing
forward tiger tiger then he
uttered a single piercing shriek of terror
and agony as the huge teeth of the charg-
ing man-eater sank into his shoulder
hurling him to the ground

  half of the villagers instantly dropped
their baskets and bags and took to the
trees the others stood their ground

clutching their spears in readiness for
attack but making no move to help the
stricken boy the major wrested one of
the heavy burys from the trembling hands
of a frightened gun-bearer but before he
could bring it to his shoulder a brown-
skinned body flashed between him and the
tiger which was now shaking its prey as
a cat shakes a mouse it was zahn armed
only with his spear dashing to the rescue
of his chum

  the man-eater saw him coming and
dropping its prey launched its striped
bulk through the air zahn halted and
extended his spear but the great carni-
vore swept the puny weapon aside with
one huge paw and seizing his face in its
mighty jaws bore him to earth

  evans who had not dared to shoot be-
fore for fear of hitting zahn now fired
at the impact of the heavy projectile the
tiger leaped high in the air just as it
struck the ground the major fired again
and it sank down motionless beside the
chiefs son

  the sportsman reached for a second
gun and advanced cautiously going up to
the beast he prodded it with the end of
the weapon but it was limp and lifeless
shot first through the body then through
the head the terrible man-eater had
breathed its last

  gingerly the natives formed a ring
around the fallen brute and his two vic-
tims lucille evans glanced at zahn then
averted her eyes with a shudder he was
past all help his face completely bitten
away she knelt beside kru muang his
shoulder was cruelly torn and lacerated
but he was still breathing

  with water from her flask and gauze
from the emergency kit she bathed his
wounds then the major saturated them
with iodine and helped her to bind them

  the natives had meanwhile rigged
two pole litters for the fallen the carcass
tam son of the tiger



of the tiger was suspended from another
pole thrust through its bound feet and
carried by four men then the sad little
procession turned its footsteps back to-
ward the village there would be no jour-
iey to the chaulmoogra groves that day

when they drew near to the village the
major went on ahead in order that he
might break the news to the tapes before
his sons mutilated body was brought in
but he met him coming out of the vil-
lage at the head of a considerable body of
armed men who seemed very much ex-
cited

the major walked up to the old fellow
and said

it is my sad duty to inform you that
your son zahn has just been killed by a
tiger he died a hero giving his life to
save his chum kru muang who is being
brought in badly wounded

the old man halted and for some time
regarded him in silence tears flooding
his eyes and starting down his withered
cheeks then he replied

let us mourn together sahib for this
day both of us have been bereaved

both of us what do you mean
speak

your little son has just been carried off
by a white tigress sahib we were com-
ing out to tell you

chapter 

the white tigress

leang the white tigress stalked majes-
j tically through the jungle grass near
the village of kyokta her tail held high
and on her feline features a look of su-
preme satisfaction she had just dined ex-
ceedingly well having slain a water buf-
falo in the jungle and was on her way to
the river to quench the thirst which fol-
lowed her feast

having drunk her fill at the stream

she was returning by the way she had
come when something white and spheri-
cal rolled across her path startling her
considerably she was within fifty feet of
one of the village huts and knew that it
must have come from that direction this
sphere which caused her involuntarily to
pause and then leap backward was an af-
front to her dignity never before had she
been molested by a human being men re-
spected her not only because she was a ti-
gress but because she was a white tigress
they did not send arrows spears and bul-
lets after her as they did at her common
striped relatives

she looked in the direction whence the
sphere had come and saw a tiny man-
thing running toward her-a little lad
with dark curly hair wearing a loose khaki
blouse shorts and tiny high-laced boots
he was laughing the spontaneous care-
free laughter of healthy childhood as he
pursued the rubber ball which he had just
hurled into the jungle grass the tigress
crouched waiting to see what he would do
next

suddenly the boy came face to face with
her - saw her for the first time she
snarled politely warning him away for
leang was not a man-eater furthermore
she had so stuffed herself with buffalo
flesh that she would not be able to eat a
morsel for many hours to come

but this boy it seemed was not so
ready to run from her as had been most
other humans she had encountered

ooh big kitty he exclaimed and
paused staring at her

she stared back slightly jerking the
tip of her tail in token of annoyance and
snarled again but more softly

big kitty mustnt be mad with tam
he said tam wont hurt you then he
fearlessly and deliberately walked up to
her and scratched her behind the ear

the tigress was so amazed at this un-


weird tales

precedented temerity that she forgot to
snarl again the little hand scratching her
neck felt good she made a contented
noise deep down in her throat and tilted
her head to one side that the boy might
better reach the spot which had begun to
feel so pleasant under his ministrations
leang was purring like a house cat but
with a noise that more nearly resembled
the rumbling of distant thunder and
while she purred the boy prattled to her
in a voice that was soft and soothing

  big kitty want to play ball he asked
presently come on and play ball with
tam

  he picked up the ball and rolled it to-
ward her

  leang was a young tigress and had not
yet lost her liking for play moreover she
had played with a ball before as she had
been raised by a man-a very strange man
she tapped the ball lightly rolling it back
at die boy who chuckled with glee for
some time they played together the tigress
apparently enjoying herself fully as much
as the boy then their play was inter-
rupted by the sound of a womans voice

  tam tam where is you honey

  the boy paused in his play to reply

  here i am clarabelle come and see
big kitty tam found

  again he rolled the ball at the tigress
but she paid no attention to it she was
snarling slightly ears cocked in the direc-
tion whence the sound of the maids voice
had come

  the colored girl who had been dozing
in the doorway of the hut and had awak-
ened to find tam missing advanced to-
ward the jungle grass which concealed boy
and beast suddenly she caught sight of
the tigress and shrieked at the top of her
voice

  her cry brought people running from
the bamboo huts near by the old bud-
dhist priest poked his shaven head out the

door of the teakwood temple a crowd of
people gathered around the negress as she
shrieked again and fell in a swoon

  suar suar a voice cried and some
of the men ran to get their spears

  tam picked up his ball and stood beside
the now thoroughly aroused tigress her
tail lashed the grass stalks and she growled
thunderously the menace in the cries and
actions of the villagers was unmistakable
this was annoying she and the boy had
been having so much fun before this inter-
ruption well they would go somewhere
else to play

  she started away with a low invitation
to tam to follow much like the mew
of a mother cat but he did not under-
stand he only stood looking at her she
paused and called again but still he stood
there bewildered looking first at her and
then at the crowd of excited villagers sur-
rounding the swooning clarabelle

  leangs feline mind considered this
man-thing was only a cub and had not
yet learned to understand the mother call
like any other cub he must be taught its
meaning she accordingly returned and
picking him up by the collar of his blouse
trotted away

  when they saw this the assembled vil-
lagers redoubled their cries men came
running with spears one carried an old
muzzle-loading gun but none of the
weapons was used for those who carried
them saw that the tigress was white a
sacred animal which they believed to be
a reincarnation of some great lady per-
haps a ranee or even a minor goddess
while they watched awe-stricken she
gave a great leap and disappeared in the
jungle she continued to run with tail
held high and tam dangling limply from
her mouth until the sounds of the voices
died away then she stood him on his
feet

  tam stroked her head and back

                     w t-
tam son of the tiger



   nice kitty he said gave tam big
ride more

   but leang didnt want to linger nor
did she care to play just then she did
want to teach this man-cub to understand
and obey her orders also her distending
mammae had begun to remind her that
she must get back to her own cub which
would be hungry and in need of her
ministrations

   she took a few steps calling to the boy
to follow her when he did not move
she returned and taking him by the arm
led him for a little way then she let go
and called once more this time he
followed

   but the way was long and difficult for
a little boy of two and soon tam grew
very tired

   wait kitty he called dont go so
fast

   but the tigress proceeded paying no
attention

presently tam stumbled and fell
he was exhausted leang turned and
looked at him for a moment then she
promptly returned picked him up by his
collar and carried him on his slight
weight did not inconvenience her at all
for leang was fully capable of lifting the
huge bulk of an ox or buffalo and had
often done it

   after traveling many miles at a steady
tireless trot she came to an ancient wall
covered with vines and creepers she
leaped to its summit and dropping lightly
to the other side crossed a weed-grown
grass plot and entered the doorway of a
small pagoda of wood and glazed tile
one of a pair that stood on each side of
the entrance to a large wot or temple
much of which was in ruins

   inside the ancient pagoda she set tam
on his feet then she affectionately licked
the little striped cub that came toddling
w t-

and mewling from a comer at her

approach

tam tried to pet the cub but it spit
at him and he backed away he had had
some painful experiences with house cats
that spit

leang lay down on her side and the
cub promptly found a nipple soon it was
purring contentedly pumping industri-
ously with both front paws as it absorbed
the warm and indubitably fresh milk
tam watched this process with consider-
able interest it was long past his lunch
time and he too was thirsty and hungry
presently he approached more closely and
sat down beside the cub the tigress
leaned over and nuzzled him pushing
him down toward the source of the liquid
food supply of which there was an over-
abundance for her one cub then she lay
back and rolled slightly-invitingly it
was a plain bid to tiffin and the boy ac-
cepted hungrily

tam had tasted mothers milk goats
milk cows milk and tinned milk but
never before had he tasted tigers milk
and never before had milk of any va-
riety tasted quite so good he pumped
and drank until his little stomach was dis-
tended quite comfortably then he slept
his tousled head pillowed on a furry fore-
leg

when tam awoke the newly risen sun
was sending its first shafts into the pa-
goda and birds were caroling their morn-
ing songs the tiger cub was curled into
a striped furry ball beside him but the
tigress was gone

he looked about him in bewilderment
at first for it seemed to him that he must
be in his little cot next to that of his fa-
ther and mother and that they were sure-
ly there beside him when he realized
where he was he began to feel very sad
and lonely and very much afraid

mother he cried daddy


weird tales

but only the twittering screeching and
chattering of the jungle folk answered
him

he sat up and again called to his par-
ents at the top of his voice then realiz-
ing that they were not with him he began
to cry

the cub disturbed by the strange
noises uncurled itself and toddled over to
him evidently understanding that he
was in distress it rubbed its striped sides
against him-a friendly sympathetic ges-
ture that showed it had accepted him as a
member of the family circle

never before had there been a time in
tams short life when his wailing had not
speedily brought some one to do some-
thing about it-to pick him up comfort
him and humor him now it amazed
and disconcerted him to find that no mat-
ter how loudly he howled nobody came
for the first time in his life he was learn-
ing the lesson which the prophet mo-
hammed learned many centuries before
-that if one wanted a mountain and it
wouldnt come when called one had best
go to the mountain

rubbing his tear-filled eyes with his
small fists he got up and walked out into
the sunshine the cub waddling after him
he was in a large walled enclosure in
the center of which stood the ruined tem-
ple the only way out was barred by a
tall brass gate sagging on its hinges and
covered with the verdigris of centuries

hungry thirsty and homesick tam
wept softly to himself as he wandered
aimlessly about the enclosure accom-
panied by the cub convinced that there
was no one to hear his cries he no longer
screamed at the top of his voice

but one of the jungle creatures had
heard for a moment it gazed down from
the top of the wall at this luscious and
helpless morsel which might easily be had
for the taking its eyes glowed with a

greenish-yellow light which showed that
it was fearful of the pungent tiger scent
but its hunger evidently overcame its fear
of the great beasts lair for it leaped
lightly into the enclosure and bounded
toward the boy and cub

the cub spit angrily then turned and
ran toward the pagoda tam looking up
saw a big kitty covered with black
spots against an orange background
bounding toward him there was some-
thing about its demeanor which struck
terror into his little heart he turned and
ran after the retreating cub but before he
could reach the pagoda sharp claws
ripped through his blouse

then snarling ferociously the leopard
bore him to earth

jungle justice

ieang the white tiger-mother awoke
j early and went forth into the gray
dawn after quenching her thirst at the
ancient fountain of bronze and marble
which though centuries had passed since
it was built still bubbled and splashed in
the center of the enclosure she leaped the
wall and set off through the jungle at a
rapid trot

it was with pleasant anticipation that
she thought of the many pounds of buffalo
flesh waiting to be consumed where she
had left her kill the day before the more
she thought of that excellent meat the
keener her appetite became and the faster
she trotted true it would have become
a bit high after many hours in the heat
but this mattered not a whit to leang
although unlike some human epicures
she preferred her meat fresh she was not
at all averse to eating it after it had be-
come quite putrid

but as she drew near the spot where
she had left the carcass there came to her
tam son of the tiger



sensitive nostrils a fetid body-scent that
caused the hairs of her neck and back to
stiffen and a low rumble to issue from her
throat jackals she bounded forward at
top speed and arrived at the spot just in
time to see a dozen slinking forms melt
into the shadows of the carcass there
remained only part of the skull the horns
and a few gnawed vertebras and rib bones
all reeking with the stench of the jungle
scavengers

  leang lashed the undergrowth with her
long tail as she roared her rage and dis-
appointment but she did not attempt to
follow the skulking forms many times
before had she been despoiled of her prey
by jackals and she had learned that it was
useless to attempt to capture the elusive
thieves

  after sniffing about for some time to
make sure there were no edible morsels
which the jackals had overlooked the
thoroughly angered tigress set off once
more toward her lair as she traveled
she hunted by the way presently an un-
wary peahen fell prey to her skill and
partly satisfied her hunger this put her
in a slightly better humor as she ap-
proached the temple ruins then she
heard a cry-the wail of her man-cub
she quickened her pace

  a spotted form flashed to the top of
the wall hung there for a moment and
then dropped to the other side leang
bounded forward

  over the wall she hurtled in one great
leap her feet barely touching its top her
own cub was scampering toward the
pagoda her man-cub trying to follow
was brought down by the leopard

  intent on his prey the spotted carni-
vore did not see the charging mother
tiger until she was almost upon him he
turned just in time to receive a cuff that
sent him rolling over and over for fully
twenty feet recovering with the agility

common to all members of the cat tribe
he dashed for the wall once in the jungle
he could easily elude the tigress a tre-
mendous spring carried him to the top
of the wall it was his last powerful
jaws closed on the back of his neck long
sharp claws sank into his mottled shoul-
ders he was dragged back into the
enclosure

  the tigress and leopard fell to the
earth together the former growling thun-
derously the latter screaming his fear and
pain as this fearful uproar smote upon
the ears of the lesser jungle creatuies
their own voices were stilled rodents
hastily sought their burrows climbers
scrambled for the highest branches birds
flew to another part of the jungle

  but the screeching of the leopard soon
ceased as leang with the precision of a
trained surgeon bit through his cervical
vertebras for a moment a shudder ran
through his frame then he lay limp and
lifeless beneath her

  far overhead a passing kite paused in
its flight wheeled and circled lower then
it dropped like a plummet alighting on
the fronds of a tall palm that stood in the
enclosure soon it was joined by a host
of others and by several vultures all ap-
parently materialized from a clear sky

tam who had regained his feet and
scampered into the pagoda with the
cub crouched in the doorway watching
breathlessly his back smarted where the
leopards claws had punctured his khaki
blouse but he had not been injured
otherwise

  crouching beside her kill the tigress
whose tremendous hunger had only been
partly satisfied by the peahen leisurely
began her second breakfast starting on
the hind quarters as is the custom with
the great cats her audience of vultures
and kites watched hungrily the former


weird tales

craning their scrawny necks the latter
maintaining their balance on the swaying
fronds by flapping their black wings from
time to time as if applauding

her hunger satisfied the tigress drank
at the fountain and went into the pagoda
tam who had been fearfully watching
the proceedings from the doorway saw
the kites and vultures descend to finish
what was left of his terrible enemy then
he joined the cub at breakfast

man can live where he pleases because
of his capacity for adapting himself to
any environment young or old weak or
strong he has this ability to a far greater
extent than any other animal

and thus it was that tam finding him-
self living under a new set of conditions
was soon as much at ease in the tigers
lair as he had formerly been in the home
of his parents

here he had a broader vista than the
four walls of his nursery had afforded
and real live kitties for playmates in-
stead of imitations stuffed with sawdust
and excelsior

it was not long before leang began
bringing meat to her lair-freshly killed
peafowls wild boars deer and at times
great haunches of buffalo meat

the boy and cub feasted very daintily
on these at first both preferring the liquid
food to which they were accustomed but
it was not long before they grew to like
meat above everything else and became
as clamorous as small children around a
parent bringing candv whenever leang
returned after a kill

the cub grew with a rapidity that
amazed tam in six months he was as
large as the boy and much stronger
though tam playing with him every day
was developing strength far beyond his
years they had many romps and mimic
fights under the approving eye of the tiger
mother and played with the ball until it

was completely worn out by the cubs
teeth and claws

tams clothes soon went to pieces but
he had no desire to replace them he was
far more comfortable in that hot climate
without them his shoes soon began to
pinch his growing feet and he discarded
these also

it was not long before he began think-
ing of himself not as a human being but
as a tiger he imitated all the sounds
made by leang and the cub and soon
grew to know the meaning of each he
could understand them or be understood
without difficulty

when the cub grew large and strong
leang as is the custom of tiger mothers
brought live game into the enclosure to
be killed by the youngsters here the cub
excelled as in the mock fighting and
tam shed tears of envy because of his
own inability to grow such splendid claws
and teeth

leang also taught both of them the
value of moving silently through the grass
and undergrowth one of their favorite
games was for both to separate then each
to try to stalk the other at this game
tam soon learned to excel the cub and
these victories helped to salve his
wounded pride at being defeated in the
mock battles and outclassed in the game
killings

then came the time when leang called
them to accompany her on a hunt the
cub was by this time able to leap to the
top of the wall but tam try as he would
couldnt make it fearful of being left
behind he ran to the gate squeezed his
slim brown body between the bars and
hurried after the two beasts his feet as
silent and his movements as stealthy as
leangs own

they found royal game indeed for the
first day it was a big bull buffalo leang
showed them how to stalk it keeping to
tam son of the tiger



windward and moving noiselessly but
when she roared the signal to charge tam
made the mistake of getting in front of
the beast before it was dragged down
by leang it tossed the boy with one long
horn scratched and bruised but not
pierced by the horn tam fell in the soft
mud fully twenty feet away he had
learned long since that crying was a use-
less accomplishment in the jungle and
got up without a whimper to return for
his share of the kill

  there were many hunts after that in
some of which tam was quite painfully
injured but he eventually learned to
avoid the horns and hoofs of deer and
buffalo and the tusks of boars

by the time tam reached his seventh
year the cub was a full-grown tiger
as large and strong as his mother some-
times the three hunted in concert but
often one or the other would wander off
to hunt alone

  tam took to exploring the jungle by
himself not merely for the sake of hunt-
ing-he killed only when hungry-but
because of the pleasure it gave him to
observe the wild things leang had
taught him to avoid the haunts of men
but like all boys he was very curious and
often went as near to the villages as he
could approach without being seen in
order to learn how the strange and terrible
creatures shaped like himself lived

  once he saw a traveling fakir charming
a cobra with his queer squalling noise-
stick tam remembered the sounds made
by that strange stick and on his return
to the wat imitated them with consider-
able success for he was a born mimic

  leang had taught him to give all ser-
pents a wide berth and for this reason
he had never dared to explore the rear
rooms of the temple which were in-
habited by cobras he decided to try his

new magic on one of them the subject
he selected paid no attention to him at
first but he persisted until it raised its
hooded head and swayed in time to the
barbaric strains emboldened by his suc-
cess he approached the snake stroked it
and picked it up finally depositing it on
the floor and getting away unscathed
often after that he amused himself at the
dangerous sport of snake-charming until
the cobras paid no more attention to his
comings and goings than to each other

  after this he made friends with many
of the other jungle creatures by watching
them patiently day after day he learned
the meanings of the various sounds they
made and imitating them was thus able
to converse with each in its own language

  from the monkeys and gibbons he
quickly learned the art of swift silent
travel through the upper traffic lanes of
the jungle from these also he learned
that certain fruits and nuts were very good
to eat and often supplemented his meat
diet with them as soon as they learned
that he would not harm them they ac-
cepted him as a friend and companion
and he passed many pleasant hours with
them amused by their strange antics

  two or three times in his wanderings
he came upon men and these meetings
were always unpleasant the first man
he met a member of a fierce hill tribe
hurled a spear at him it pierced his arm
and clung there for some time as he scur-
ried away through the forest he plucked
it out and flung it from him but it left a
painful wound that was many days in
healing

  several times after that he came upon
men unexpectedly and all of them were
ready to use their weapons first and ask
questions afterward he decided that
men like leopards jackals and hyenas
could only be regarded as dangerous
enemies and had best be avoided


weird tales

the first herd of wild elephants he en-
countered excited his wonder for many
days he followed them observing how the
great pachyderms lived

once in his northern wanderings he
came into a teak forest that was being
worked here there were many elephants
laboring under the direction of men who
sometimes walked beside them some-
times sat on their necks these elephants
wore wooden bells that went tika tok
tok tok and some had leg-irons that
clanked when they moved

always keeping well out of sight tam
watched the mahouts striving to learn
how they controlled the great brutes and
resolving that some day he too would
capture an elephant and cause it to obey
him he noticed that the ankus or ele-
phant hook was a part of every mahouts
equipment and one night succeeded in
pilfering one and getting away unscathed
he returned to the wat with his treasure
but the wild herd had moved to another
feeding-ground so he put the ankus away
in the pagoda for future reference

tam took no notice of the passing of
time but he did notice that as the seasons
came and went he grew larger and
stronger whereas after the fifth year
leangs cub had ceased to grow several
times during those years strange tigers
had come to the wat evidently attracted
by leang but these she had always driven
away

in his wanderings through the jungle
tam also met a number of strange tigers
they neither ran from him nor attempted
to attack him but treated him precisely
as if he were another tiger this was be-
cause if they voiced their thoughts and
feelings as tigers often do he answered
them in their own language if they re-
mained silent he addressed them in the
same language making it plain that
though he was friendly enough he was

not to be trifled with for he was a very
devil of a tiger himself

by the time he was twelve years of age
he could pull down his buck or boar quite
as well as leang though a buffalo was
still too much for him

one day after he and the two tigers
had slain and devoured a buck they re-
turned to the temple enclosure to drink
at the fountain

suddenly they heard a voice a human
voice at the gate

leang it said

turning tam beheld a tall man with
a wrinkled yellow face peering through
the gate he wore a red cap and a robe
of the same color caught over his left
shoulder his right arm and shoulder
were bare

to tam every man was a deadly
enemy he snarled fiercely and the tiger
echoed his snarl

but leang only stared at the stranger

chapter 

the red lama

iozong the pious lama drew his robe
- of red lhasa cloth more tightly about
his tall straight figure as he plunged into
the jungle trail which he had not taken for
more than ten years and which was nearly
obliterated by the vegetation

when necessary he swung his dah or
double-curved jungle knife to clear the
path but as he cut and forced his way
through the thick undergrowth he did not
for a moment cease to lay up merit for
himself in the world to come for over and
over again his lips framed the mystical
formula om mani padme hum o
jewel in the lotus amen

despite his priestly garb and pious
declamations there was something in the
bearing of lozong which made it appear
that he had not always been a man of the
tam son of the tiger



robe and alms-bowl his straight sol-
dierly figure smacked more of the camp
and battlefield and the ease and precision
with which he used his dah showed more
than casual acquaintance with a cutting
weapon

  his mongoloid features were old and
yet young for though his sun-cured skin
was like wrinkled yellow parchment his
black eyes flashed with a fire that was
decidedly youthful they were the eyes
of a conqueror descendant of a race that
had once terrorized the entire civilized
world and were strangely incongruous in
the otherwise austere countenance

  as he hewed and chanted his way
through the jungle he wondered if leang
the white tigress still lived in the pagoda
before the temple ruins in which he had
made his home for five years and from
which ten years before he had emerged
to go on a long pilgrimage he had
visited most of the celebrated shrines of
india burma and siam learning sanskrit
that he might study the ancient religious
books of india and seeing many strange
and wonderful sights

  thirteen years before lozong who
had retired to the old sacred ruins to medi-
tate in solitude and to lay up merit had
found an orphan tiger cub less than three
months old playing in a nest beneath the
umbrella-like foliage of a korinda the
bones of the mother lay near by picked
clean by scavengers she had evidently
been shot or poisoned and had succumbed
before she could reach her lair

  the cub which was a white female was
half starved had it been an ordinary
striped animal lozong would have left it
there to die but as it was white and there-
fore sacred he could acquire much merit
by saving its life he had accordingly
captured the spitting and growling young-
ster in his robe and taken it to his retreat
establishing it in a grass nest in the pa-

goda after that for many months he
had been kept busy trapping birds and
small game for his young charge which
he named leang he built traps that
caught the game alive then permitted
his pet to kill it herself so he need not
commit the sin of taking animal life

  but leang had eventually learned to
do her own hunting and when she was
nearly three years old began consorting
at night with her own kind lozong let
her come and go as she pleased and she
remained quite friendly until one morn-
ing when he approached the pagoda she
warned him away with a thunderous
growl he understood and did not go
near her den for many days nor did she
come to see him in his temple room as
was her wont

  but one day as he was seated on the
temple steps eating his frugal meal of
curry and rice donated by a village house-
wife she had emerged from the pagoda
followed by four striped cubs which she
proudly led up to him for inspection

  a few days later a tiger came-a great
striped brute he killed and ate three of
the cubs which had been playing in the
temple enclosure the fourth asleep in
the pagoda he overlooked leang re-
turned as he was devouring the third little
body lozong watching from the temple
corridor saw an exhibition of feline fury
such as it falls to the lot of few men to
witness the tiger badly scratched and
bitten beat a hasty retreat nor did he
dare come near the place again he had
been leangs mate but never would she
mate with him again

  a few days thereafter lozong had gone
on his long pilgrimage bidding the sacred
tigress and her remaining cub a fond fare-
well now as he neared the temple ruins
his thoughts were on the two creatures he
had left there

  leang would be thirteen years old the


weird tales

cub which he had named chiam
would be ten-a full-grown tiger in his
prime

  suddenly as he neared a little glade
which he knew to be but a short distance
from the temple ruins he heard the roar
of a charging tiger and the crashing of
heavy bodies through the underbrush
silently he slid behind a tree and watched

  into the glade a buck came leaping
behind it bounded an immense tiger it
looked as if the buck would escape when
there swiftly flashed from the under-
growth in its path a lithe sun-browned
human form-a slender boy about twelve
years of age naked and unarmed from
the other side a white tigress charged
but it was the boy who brought down the
game he met the buck in midair gripped
the antlers and twisted them to one side
as his prey went down he uttered a roar
that matched that of the tiger and sank
his teeth into the furry throat

  then while the astonished lama looked
on from his place of concealment the
boy and two beasts settled down to feed
on their kill

  lozong did not doubt that the white
tigress was leang and the tiger might
be her cub chiam or a new mate but
this naked black-haired boy with the voice
of a tiger and the muscles of a gladiator-
who could he be and whence could he
have come it was plain that he was not
of the tribes of burma or siam nor yet
of india or tibet though his skin was
deeply tanned by the sun he was un-
doubtedly white like the english or
french

  the lama knew better than to approach
a feeding tiger so he kept out of sight
until the boy and the two beasts had fin-
ished he knew that after they had eaten
they would drink and wondered if they
would go to the river or the temple when
they turned toward the ruins his belief in

the identity of leang was confirmed and
he followed silently

the boy and the two brutes leaped the
wall and lozong watching through
the bars of the bronze gate saw them
drinking at the fountain

when they had finished he cried

leang

the tigress turned looking curiously
in his direction the boy and tiger both
snarled

leang come here he called as he
had summoned her in the old days

she pricked up her ears elevated her
tail and trotted toward the gate behind
her came the boy and the tiger

in leangs attitude there was only curi-
osity but the others were openly hostile

dont you remember me leang
asked lozong dont you remember your
old master who fed you

the tigress sniffed at him through the
bars the boy and tiger were snarling
belligerently

suddenly with an angry snarl the boy
sprang-raked the lamas bare shoulder
with his nails but leang turned on him
-cuffed him back at this instant the
tiger leaped but him also she buffeted
back then she rubbed her jowl against
the bars and lozong knew that she
remembered

fearlessly he scratched her under the
chin-behind the ear-while she purred
loudly the boy and the tiger remained
in the background still unfriendly but
obedient to the tigress

presently the lama took a large bronze
key from the voluminous breast pocket of
his robe and inserted it in the lock of the
gate it stuck with the corrosion acquired
during his ten years absence but he
eventually succeeded in turning it then
he swung the gate on its complaining
tam son of the tiger



hinges and boldly entered closing it after
him

leang stood aside to let him in then
walked with him as he fearlessly strode
toward the temple he watched the boy
and tiger from the corners of his eyes as
he passed but they made no move to
molest him it was evident that they had
a wholesome respect for the authority of
the white tigress

straight through the ruined temple
portal he went and to the room he had
previously occupied here he squatted
cross-legged on the floor and leang
stretched out beside him unslinging his
alms-bowl he lifted the bit of oily paper
which covered it disclosing the rice and
ghee which a woman of the near-by vil-
lage had given him

he made a greasy ball and held it out
to leang just as he had fed her from his
bowl ten years before she took it daintily
chewed it much more than was necessary
and swallowed it but when he offered
her more she turned her head away evi-
dently buttered rice was no longer to her
liking it was as if she had taken the first
morsel for politeness sake

lozong ate rapidly for the sun was
nearing the zenith and it was not per-
mitted that he eat solid food after midday
having completed his plain but satisfying
meal he took his water-strainer from his
pocket and went out for a drink at the
fountain the strainer being a religious
rather than a hygienic precaution as it
was unlawful for him to take animal life
even of the most minute kind

stretched in the shade of one of the
mango trees that lined the approach the
boy and tiger barred his path to the foun-
tain the lama did not wish to show fear
nor did he desire to arouse either of them
as he knew that if one should spring for
him the other also would attack

he advanced cautiously intending to

circle the two and pass on but just as he
turned aside from the path an ugly
hooded head reared its spectacled death-
sign above the grass

the cobra swayed angrily for a moment
with darting tongue-then struck

chapter 

the first lesson

the head of the striking cobra moved
as swiftly as an arrow yet just a
fraction of a second quicker flashed the
dah of lozong there was a scarcely per-
ceptible turn of the lamas wrist and the
keen blade severed the venomous head
with the neat drawing cut of an expert

although he had momentarily saved
his own life by his quickness with the
weapon lozong by making the sudden
movement had instantly put it in jeopardy
again the boy and tiger basking in the
shade both took it for a hostile gesture
their roars resounded together as they
sprang for the lama

according to lozongs belief he had
committed a deadly sin by slaying the
cobra despite the fact that he had acted
on the spur of the moment to save his own
life many thousands of om mani
padme hums would have to be said be-
fore sufficient merit was acquired to atone
for this one art

but the instinct of self-preservation
made him turn again at this new attack
his dah lightly balanced in the hand so
skilled in its use as the boy and tiger
sprang at him

leang right behind her former master
leaped for the tiger knocking him over
in an instant he was rolling on the ground
with the tigress standing over him

seeing this the lama smiled and
dropped his dah as the boy sprang upon
him tiger fashion the lad attacked with
teeth and nails and tigerish was the


weird tales

strength of the muscles that rippled be-
neath his sun-browned skin

but lozong who had not always been
a lama who was a past master in the arts
of offense and defense knew how to meet
his every movement and turn it into de-
feat had it not been for the uncertainty
of what the tigers might do he would
have played with him but because of
that uncertainty he quickly ended the
contest

catching one extended wrist the lama
turned and dragged the arm across his
shoulder throwing the boy heavily be-
fore he could recover he was down beside
him his hands playing skilfully here and
there the lad was for a time paralyzed
-helpless lozong had learned jiu jitsu
from a japanese expert and learned it
well

picking up his dah the lama sheathed
it and proceeded serenely toward the foun-
tain precisely as if nothing had happened
he drank then returned to the temple
looking neither to the right nor the left
the boy still unable to move snarled as
he passed but the tigers now lying side
by side in the shade made no sound

lozong squatted cross-legged in the
shade of the portal and began clicking
the wooden beads of his rosary the while
he muttered his monotonous om mani
padme hum this prayer would have to
be said countless thousands of times in
order to recover the merit lost by slaying
the cobra

but the repetition of the prayer was
purely mechanical his mind was oc-
cupied with the problem of making
friends with the other occupants of the
wat leang he believed could be counted
on to remain friendly the tiger which
he now felt sure was chiam because of the
way leang had cuffed him about was
more of a problem though he had petted
and handled him when a tiny cub there

was no possibility of that memory assist-
ing him now he must find some other
way

  and the boy he indeed was the great-
est problem of all wild and ferocious
as the tigers and aided by a mind far
superior he could be approached only
with the greatest caution lozong pon-
dered the course to be pursued as he mut-
tered his prayers and gazed out at him
through the dancing heat waves

  presently the lad finding himself able
to move once more stood up he flexed
his muscles as if to make certain that they
would serve him the lama forgot his
prayers for a moment fearing another
attack as the boy looked in his direction
but the lad turned and went over to where
the headless body of the cobra lay no
malice showed on his features-only
wonder and curiosity after examining
the decapitated reptile with evident puz-
zlement he went over and lay down in
the shade with the panting tigers so far
as the lama was concerned he seemed
disposed to ignore his presence

  as he lay there in the shade tam
though feigning to completely ignore the
strange being who had moved into the
wat was very much concerned about him
he was puzzled by the fact that leang
not only obeyed him as if she were his
cub but actually showed affection for him
even to the point of protecting him against
her own offspring

  despite the fact that he had always con-
sidered all men as his enemies tam was
beginning to believe that this unusual
person who had defeated him almost
painlessly was friendly

  suddenly the man in red began making
strange noises with his mouth which
sounded very much like those made by
the people of the villages to tam they
were incomprehensible yet the man
seemed to be addressing him although
tam son of the tiger



during his ten years in the jungle he had
learned the language of most of the wild
things tam had not picked up a single
human word to add to the meager nursery
vocabulary he had brought with him at
the age of two and even this through
disuse had been long forgotten

  but now the man was making noises
which aroused some latent memory hav-
ing tried him with tibetan burmese and
siamese lozong was now speaking
english

  what is your name my son he
asked who are you

  at the words what is your name
there flashed through tams mind the
recollection of an answer which should
follow-an answer in which he had been
drilled day after day by his parents in
case he should ever be lost he turned
and faced the lama as he replied

  tam evans  lake shore drive
phone lake shore 

  come over here and sit with me in
the shade tam evans said lozong i
would be your friend

  tam stared at him in bewilderment not
because he couldnt comprehend his mean-
ing but because he could gradually
taking form in his objective conscious-
ness were memories shadowy and indis-
tinct of his father and mother and of his
black nurse-maid who had made such
sounds which he had understood long
long ago yet never since that time had
he heard human beings make sounds
which had any meaning for him

  you need not be afraid i wont hurt
you assured the lama

  at this tam sneered

  you hurt tam tam afraid no
tam is a fierce kitty tam could kill and
eat you he amazed himself as the un-
familiar speech rolled from his lips for
he was translating into english exactly

what he would have said to a strange tiger
inclined to be bellicose

the lama smiled he knew better than
to dispute the boys strange statement at
this stage

all right fierce kitty he said come
over and talk to me

tam walked over and crouched on the
steps near him they talked long the
erudite lama skilfully adapting his speech
to the boys tiger-like thought processes
and limited vocabulary and thus there
began a firm friendship that was to last
for many years

that night the lama slept on the bare
floor of his cell the following
morning when he awoke he found
freshly gathered fruit lying beside him
and a newly killed bird of paradise he
ate part of the fruit but the bird he would
not eat raw and it was forbidden that he
should prepare his own food so he car-
ried it outside

neither tam nor leang was in sight
but chiam the tiger was lying at the foot
of the temple steps lozong tossed the
bird to him he leaped back with a snarl
then seized it and carried it off to the
bone-littered space before the pagoda to
devour it

lozong drank at the fountain let him-
self out at the gate and with his alms-
bowl tucked in the large breast pocket of
his robe set off for a near-by village

he had not gone far when he heard a
rustling in the branches above his head
looking up he beheld tam a gibbon
that had evidently been with him scam-
pered off through the branches

where you going asked the boy

to the village where men live re-
plied the lama

dont go said tam they will kill
you with sharp sticks and eat you

no they will give me food to eat
replied lozong


weird tales

tam followed him as far as the edge
of the jungle but would go no farther
when the lama returned his bowl filled
with curried vegetables and rice the boy
was waiting for him they walked
through the jungle together back to the
temple ruins as they were passing
through the courtyard chiam the tiger
came out of the pagoda at sight of the
lama chiam growled menacingly and
barred his way to the portal

lozong paused this time the white
tigress was not there to defend him
chiam advanced ears laid back tail lash-
ing the air voicing his disapproval of the
lama in no uncertain tones

to lozongs surprize the boy leaped
in front of the tiger there issued from
his throat a growl that matched in volume
and ferocity the voice of the big feline
for some time boy and beast growled and
snarled at each other then the tiger
sprang

the lama dropped his begging-bowl
and whipped out his dah expecting tam
would be mangled by those terrible teeth
and claws but the boy leaped lightly to
one side and before the beast could re-
cover had flung himself on its back grip-
ping the loose skin of its neck and lock-
ing his feet far back beneath the belly
he hung on like grim death the tiger
flung itself over backward rolled over
and over and tried its best to paw him
off but to no avail fresently the beast
subsided panting

tam laughed and releasing his hold
scratched the big feline behind the ear
making low purring sounds meanwhile
which were answered by the tiger

then he stood up and returned to where
the astounded lama waited

kitty wont hurt you now he said
i told him you were our friend

but you might have been killed ex-
claimed lozong

tam laughed

we play like that often he said
when i was little and weak he could
beat me but now i am big and strong
now i win the games he still has better
teeth and claws but i am quicker some
day when my teeth and claws grow bigger
it will be easier

you will grow bigger some day
tam said the lama but you will never
have big teeth and claws men do not
have them you must stop thinking you
are a kitty because you are a boy and
when you grow up you will be a man
i was a boy once replied tam i
remember a little about it

and you are still a boy replied
lozong there are many things i must
teach you which boys and men should
know they sat down in the shade and
there across the alms-bowl began tams
first lesson

chapter 

the gods of asia

each day lozong made his morning
trip to the near-by village but
about two weeks after his arrival at the
temple he returned with a parcel wrapped
in heavy paper he made a great mystery
of it until he and tam reached his cell
then he unwrapped it ceremoniously

tam watched with wide-eyed curiosity
as the lama took out several books pads
of writing-paper pencils and a ruler
what are they he asked

i sent for them replied lozong in
order that i might teach you to read and
write the language of your people these
will be the foundation for your education
and thus at the age when most chil-
dren have graduated from grammar
school tam made his beginning

he progressed rapidly and lozong
ordered more books and supplies for him
tam son of the tiger



from time to time each afternoon was
set aside for his studies his mornings
were usually spent roving in the jungle
the lama was an excellent instructor be-
cause he made everything interesting and
tams thirst for knowledge was insatiable

  book knowledge was not all that
lozong taught his pupil he taught him
jiu jitsu and boxing and the use of the
dah at first he let tam use his knife
but one day he brought him a bright new
one from the village with a sheath and
belt he had previously persuaded tam
to wear a garment which he had cut for
him from red lhasa cloth it was merely
a narrow strip of the material passed over
his left shoulder and wound about his
loins but quite enough for that climate

  when tam had become proficient with
the dah the lama brought him other
weapons and taught him their use they
soon accumulated quite an arsenal of
spears bows and arrows crossbows and
their shorter projectiles blowguns and
darts axes and swords for hours at a
time they would practise shooting at
marks hurling spears and knives and
fencing

  lozongs favorite weapon was the
terrible yatagan or double-curved sword
with this he would fell a tall tree at a
single blow then instruct his pupil to cut
it up

  at first tam could not more than cut
half through the trunk of a tree felled by
his teacher but gradually he got the
knack of it

  slic lozong would cry excitedly
when tam in spite of his powerful
muscles would end with his blade still
sticking in the wood watch this ob-
serve that i do not strike with half the
force you used yet my blade passes clear
through why because i turn the
wrist so and draw the blade back so so
i bring it down your wrist should be

of rubber not of wood you chop like a
clumsy chinaman

  so tam would try again and yet again
but he was sixteen before he could cleave
through a trunk that lozong had felled
at a single blow and twenty before he
had become his equal at fence mean-
while his studies had progressed tremen-
dously he could read and write tibetan
and sanskrit as well as english and had
studied and discussed with lozong the
sciences and the leading religions of the
world

  but most of all he liked to hear lo-
zong relate his interesting life experiences
-how his people had moved to hang-
chow from tibet when he was a boy and
he had become a christian and gone to
school at the ching nea way the ameri-
can y m c a then how he had gone
to japan and saved the life of a descend-
ant of the samurai who had taught him
jiu jitsu and swordsmanship and then
how he had gone to visit his parents who
had moved back to tibet and while there
had been left for dead by a company of
chinese soldiers that had massacred the
entire village including his parents and
his brothers and sisters embittered
against the chinese he had turned brig-
and and soon became leader of the most
dreaded band of marauders in that re-
gion his fame had spread and new re-
cruits had flocked to him until he be-
came a military power to be reckoned
with

  but he grew sick of bloodshed and end-
less campaigns and at thirty decided to
give up all his possessions and seek sal-
vation by way of the eight-fold path he
had accordingly taken leave of his follow-
ers and entered a lamasery but such was
his popularity and piety that in less than
a year he had become its chief lama

  still dissatisfied he left the lamasery in
charge of a subordinate and set out on a


weird tales

pilgrimage a seeker after that elusive
entity truth wandering through bur-
ma he had accidentally found the an-
cient ruins where he had tarried for a
time to meditate and study in solitude
and near which he had found leang

  at twenty tam had not only grown
mentally but had attained to splendid
physical manhood he was slightly taller
than lozong who was six feet without
his sandals broad-shouldered narrow-
hipped and superbly muscled

  leang and chiam had become middle-
aged tigers and though he still hunted
with them tam now employed the wea-
pons lozong had taught him to use like
his preceptor he came to favor the yata-
gan above all other weapons with this
he could sever the neck or split the skull
of a charging buffalo at a single stroke

  nor had he forgotten his many jungle
friends these he had cultivated through
the years but the achievement which had
pleased him most of all was his conquest
of a mighty bull elephant the great bull
suffering from that strange temporary
madness called must had slain his ma-
hout one day when the man had used his
ankus a bit too roughly and dashed off
into the jungle he had managed to
elude the men sent after him and his
wanderings had brought him to tams
hunting-grounds

  for many days tam had watched him
feeding in the forest or wallowing in the
river spraying himself with water from
the first day he carried the ankus which
he had been keeping for just such an oc-
casion though he feared no jungle crea-
ture it was with some trepidation that
tam went up to the great brute for the
first time carrying a peace offering of fruit

  the elephant which had fully recov-
ered from its illness by this time readily
responded to the commands which tam
had learned by observing the mahouts

and he received one of the greatest thrills
of his life when swung upward on the
trunk of the huge pachyderm he took his
seat behind the gigantic head and ankus
in hand rode off through the forest

  he said nothing of his conquest to
lozong but several days later when he
and the great brute had become better ac-
quainted he rode his mighty steed down
the path to meet the lama on his return
from the village

  astounded lozong looked on while
tam put the big beast through his paces
finally causing him to kneel so that the
lama might mount his back they rode
home in state that night or nearly so for
the elephant stopped and refused to budge
when he scented the lair of the tigers by
much perseverance and the employment
of fruit and balls of sweetened rice tam
eventually persuaded him to enter the en-
closure and actually to make friends with
the two tigers after that ganesha as
they called him made his headquarters in
the temple enclosure he was friendly to-
ward lozong but showed positive affec-
tion for tam

one day ganesha wandered away
and did not return that night as was
his wont worried tam set out on his
trail the next morning

  as usual tam carried the weapons
which had made him master of the jungle
from his belt hung his dah and yatagan
at his back was his quiver containing his
powerful bow and a supply of arrows in
his hand he carried the ankus his scepter
of authority over the elephant

  the trail of ganesha led straight to the
north and tam followed it all morning
without pausing but as the blazing sun
reached the zenith he decided to halt for
rest and refreshment he had eaten only
a little fruit for breakfast and his long
tramp had engendered meat hunger he
turned aside from the trail to hunt
tam son of the tiger



  traversing a dense thicket of bamboo
he came out in a flat expanse of tall jungle
grass through which a little brook mean-
dered thirsty he went down to the
stream to drink he had barely touched
his lips to the purling water when he
heard a movement in the tall grass on the
farther bank silently he slid back into
the rushes and drew his yatagan no
doubt this was some jungle creature com-
ing for a drink well it should supply
the meat he craved the breeze was
neither in his favor nor against him but
blowing downstream so his nose told him
nothing he must wait for his eyes to re-
veal the quarry

  as he crouched there in the rushes
tam gasped in amazement at sight of the
wondrous creature that emerged from the
waving jungle grass a slender girl pant-
ing and swaying as if from exhaustion
ran out on the bank

  her garments were unlike anything he
had ever seen or heard of on her head
was a tight-fitting golden helmet crowned
with a gold disk above a silver crescent
set on a uraeus with eyes that were smol-
dering rubies wisps of her dark-brown
hair peeped from beneath the magnificent
head-piece and in her hazel eyes was the
look of one who has just escaped some un-
speakable horror her shapely limbs and
torso were encased in light golden chain
mail reinforced by sliding shoulder plates
circular breast plates and a jointed girdle
with a skirt of taces and adorned with
glittering jewels set in strange designs
from her belt of scarlet leather hung a
dagger sheath and sword scabbard both
empty

  fascinated tam stared in breathless
wonder and admiration but the slight
hint of a movement in the tall grass be-
hind the girl drew his jungle-trained eyes
something was stalking her then he

saw the striped tip of a long tail lashing
above the grass and he knew

he leaped up a cry of warning on his
lips but at that moment the tiger sprang
emitting a thunderous roar as it crushed
its victim to the ground

with an answering roar tam leaped
across the brook and confronted the tiger
his yatagan gleaming in his hand

standing over the prostrate girl the
tiger snarled its anger at this presump-
tuous human who had the temerity to dis-
pute its right to its prey then it charged
and reared up to seize its challenger teeth
gleaming and claws aspread

with the swiftness of lightning flashed
the razor-sharp yatagan it caught the rear-
ing tiger squarely between the eyes and
divided its skull as neatly as a dah divides
an orange finding lodgment in the neck
vertebras like a thing of inflated rub-
ber the mighty body collapsed

tam jerked his blade free and sprang
to die side of the girl

are you badly hurt he asked in
english

she did not understand but held up
both hands to him a gesture he could not
fail to comprehend he dropped his gory
blade and grasping her hands helped her
to her feet despite the weight of her
armor she seemed light as a feather and
when she leaned against tam for support
the crest of her helmet barely reached to
his shoulder tam repeated his query in
tibetan and sanskrit she appeared to
understand the latter language and replied
in a language that was very much like it-
enough to make her speech intelligible to
tam

my armor protected me she said
then added i am very thirsty let me
drink

with his arm around her slender waist
tam helped her down the bank then sup-

a tale of colossal caterpillars that ate their way through london
spreading disaster and death

	the mysterious plane

on the first of july - an
officer on night duty at the air
ministry was sitting at his desk
studying an air map of the channel and
the southern counties of england the
time was three in the morning and the
presence at such an hour of this officer
and many others who were on duty in the
building was explained by the fact that a
state of political tension existed between
great britain and an alliance of european
states nothing that indicated war or
even a rupture of diplomatic relations had
been allowed to reach the press nor was
it in the least probable that any of the
countries concerned would be so criminal
or so foolish as to resort to the last
arbitrament but the tension was there
and the government of the day was not
one that would be caught napping

however peacefully the people might
be sleeping in their beds those respon-
sible for the defense of the nation were
painfully aware of the possibilities of such
a situation they knew that in those times
a declaration of war would be followed
by almost instantaneous action vast
fleets of aircraft loaded with the deadliest
bombs would be released at once and
would be over the cities of the enemy
almost before he was aware of the fact
that he was to be attacked and many of
these craft would be of new and secret
kinds certainly there would be flights
of pilotless automatically guided planes
some timed to drop their bombs on a
given area and return some simply to
plunge with their load of destruction into


the unsuspecting cities to which they were
directed there was also the possibility
that no actual declaration of war would
be made and that attack would be the first
notification of it certainly there would
be no time for the mobilization of exist-
ing forces or the improvization of new
armies and air fleets

at the first hint of trouble the air
force had been keyed up to the highest
state of readiness the military and naval
reserves had been recalled to the colors
under the pretext of extensive combined
maneuvers and the government arsenals
and many privately owned firms were
working at full blast as a measure of un-
employment relief such was and is the
complacency of the british public that
these excuses actually passed current as
the truth and the press was completely
muzzled by a new official secret act
hurriedly rushed through parliament the
parochially minded descendants of the
empire builders were absorbed in their
games and more interested in cricket
scores and bathing girls than in the
destiny of europe such is their custom
encouraged by politicians for their own
ends but throwing a tremendous respon-
sibility upon those who encourage it

the officer was studying with partic-
ular interest on the maps before him the
broad lines indicating the many new
arterial roads which converged upon lon-
don from all parts of the country and he
was reflecting bitterly upon their use as
guides to enemy aircraft he visualized
how at the moment these long avenues
of light made the finding of the capital
w t-
moth



a rush of air almost lifted him from the
ground

mere childs play to airmen but he re-
membered as a compensating factor that
the existence of similar roads all over the
continent provided equal facilities for the
defending forces

   it is a matter of history that the great-
est feature of world development in the
decade preceding the date of this account
had been the amazing development of the
use of electricity it had become so cheap
that it was used for every conceivable
purpose the towns were as light at night
as they were in the daytime and every
road of importance was brilliantly illu-
minated from end to end and carried as
much if not more traffic in what were
once the hours of darkness as by day
the civilized world by night was a blaze
of light golf courses cricket and football
fields and polo grounds were thronged
with players and watching crowds only
w t-

in the deep country was the old order of
nature still observed and night fell in
comfortable darkness

some curious results of this almost
universal abolition of darkness had been
observed but they meant nothing to the
mob mind one was the almost complete
dying out of many species of insectivorous
birds which naturalists attributed to the
fact that millions of inseas attracted to
the blaze of light dashed themselves to
death against the innumerable lamps
with the consequence that in the ensuing
year there were no caterpillars to feed
the nestlings and each successive year
this phenomenon repeated itself until it
was only in remote districts or in the few
remaining forests that many once-com-
mon birds were to be found at all the
dearth of birds in turn led to a devas-
tating increase in many kinds of insect

life not affected by light and englands
declining agriculture tottered on the edge
of ruin kept alive only by the frantic
efforts of science to combat by chemical
means the growing plagues thus there
was added to the already existing political
troubles of the world a fear ever present
in the minds of its governors of a food
shortage great britain was becoming
more and more dependent upon europe
and america for its food and the causes
that operated against agriculture were
beginning to make themselves felt there
as well and so in this world of blazing
light there existed a tension which might
have broken at any moment into world-
conflict though happily it did not

a telephone bell rang shrilly in the
silent room at the air ministry and
the officer lifted the instrument beside
him manston air station was speaking
and speaking with subdued excitement

  two unidentifiable planes of large
size have just passed over here they are
quite an unknown type so far as could
be observed and they seemed to keep out
of range of the searchlights-came from
southwest and flew round and then
headed along the coast toward birching-
ton and herne bay ive warned all sta-
tions to be on the lookout and sent two
scouts up in pursuit

  very good said the officer calmly
hold on for a moment

  he summoned another officer and gave
certain emergency instructions for the
defense of london satisfied that wires
and wireless were busy he turned to the
telephone again

  manston right now can you
describe these planes

  like nothing ive ever seen sir
began the voice at the other end some-
thing new and devilish by the look of
them id only a glimpse as they dodged

the lights its difficult to give a co-
herent account the impression they made
on us was so queer

  all right manston-take it slowly
then said the officer

  wing expanse about a hundred feet
at least id say-absolutely silent engine
-caught a queer swishing sound now
and then as if they were gliding but the
damned thing was the action of the
wings

  action of the wings what do you
mean

  well sir they came planing down
till they saw us and then the wings
seemed to give a flap and the thing shot
away at a terrific speed

  movable wings eh bird flight-
what weve been trying for ourselves
-wish we could bring one down go
on-how many propellers and engines
none sir-that is no propellers as
far as we could see-action of the wings
only-unless theres a propeller in the
tail no visible engines

  another officer came into the room and
laid a typed slip on the table it indicated
that the london air defense was fully
mobilized and in the air the first officer
nodded and the other handed him a sec-
ond slip which read

  two unknown planes passed over southend
heading london no identification marks un-
known class moving fast

  well theyll be stopped was his
comment

  easy thing sir if there are no more
said his junior as he went out the con-
versation with manston was resumed
what lights did they carry

  none sir-thats to say not exactly
lights

  what do you mean exactly

  well on either side of the nose there
seemed to be a big sort of window
divided into sort of honeycomb panes-
observation posts id say i think they
moth



had lights inside-at least when the
searchlight hit them you could see those
two windows or whatever they were all
lit up and glowing red big things some-
thing like a searchlight disk if you follow
me only practically no light seemed to
come out of them-when they passed out
of the light you could just see them
glowing like windows sounds crazy sir
but we all saw them and theres no mis-
take

  im not thinking there is any mistake
travers said the officer gravely we
know that extrania has had a secret plane
up its sleeve for some time mind you
this may only be a practise spin by some
of their pilots-it doesnt follow that
theyre out for mischief still if they
come over london they know that theyll
be shot down and thats their lookout
report anything fresh at once

  did i say anything about the color
sir

  no-i ought to have asked you that
-its very important

  sort of silvery gray sir so far as we
tould make out with curious markings on
the underside of the wings the fuselage
seemed a bit darker-but at night it was
difficult to tell it was very good camou-
flage anyhow

  thank you travers let me have
your scouts report at once wont you
right sir

the officer hung up the receiver and
began to make notes after a time
he rose and going to the window flung
it open it was still dark and all the lights
of london had been cut off on the first
alarm the air was full of the droning
of planes which were circling in squad-
rons over the city from the outer de-
fenses long pencils of light roved inces-
santly over the sky and from the streets
below the building rose a murmur of

voices and the shuffle of many feet all
london was in the streets by this time
attracted by the noise overhead and the
sudden darkness wild rumors were
already flying about and to prevent panic
the police were announcing that it was
only a special test of the air defense
forces

  the door of the room was flung open
suddenly and a tall gray-haired man
wrapped in a fur coat strode in the offi-
cer swung round and after a glance at
his visitor saluted

  tell me what is all this langton
asked the prime minister without cere-
mony are we actually attacked

  i hope not sir was the reply but
two mysterious planes of large size and
strange design came in over the kent
coast and are reported heading for lon-
don without lights you see we are
ready sir

  yes i see that replied mr perceval
its all admirable if a civilian may say
so but i can scarcely contemplate the
possibility of attack from extrania with-
out a declaration of war and were far
from that stage

  quite sir-but you never know the
first blow wins the next war they say
anyhow all weve done is to put plan a
in operation according to the standing
orders

  if they reach london or try to reach
it what do you do asked mr perceval

  shoot em down sir acting against
the international code in that fashion
could only mean war on their part i
rather hope we do get them down sir-
they seem to be something quite new in
design

  very well said the prime minister
ill go back to downing street and id
better look in at the palace youll keep
me posted


weird tales

  of course sir can you find your
way i mustnt leave this telephone

  the prime minister departed as quick-
ly as he had come and the officer resumed
his vigil at the window but nothing hap-
pened save that the crowds in the street
grew in numbers and the planes con-
tinued to drone through the sky dawn
began to break at last but no further
news of the raiders came through re-
ports poured in from air stations all over
the country all to the same effect that
nothing had been seen or heard of the
raiders the people quieted by the police
statements began to straggle home to
their beds the light grew and the
london sparrows began their cheerful
twittering save for a few scouts the
defending planes were ordered back to
their respective stations and what seemed
like a normal day began in the streets

the officer stretched himself and
yawned he was very tired and his
relief would soon take over but he was
not quite easy in his mind about what
was to come although the consensus of
official opinion was that two foreign
pilots trying out a new machine had ven-
tured over england in the dark and made
for home when they saw they were dis-
covered somehow langton did not feel
that it was just like that

  the telephone bell rang shrilly at his
elbow

  hillow yes this is langton speak-
ing wants to speak to me personally-
who dye say a colonel butler-dont
know him well if its urgent put him
through

  a voice boomed in his ear

  is that aircommodore langton

  it is

  my names butler-colonel late
loamshires on the retired list i have a

son in the air force so i knew that you
were in charge at the ministry

  well-what do you want sir

  give me time sir i live at epping-
house is fairly high up and commands a
view of most of the forest

  yes said langton with new interest
heard all that row this morning-
planes woke me looking out of my
window i thought i saw something big
in the sky with no lights and i thought
it seemed to come down in the forest
the devil you did what did you do
nothing-might have been mere
fancy and how could you start up to
search the forest in the dark however
first thing this morning i saddled up and
rode round a bit just where i thought it
might be theres a big plane lying on the
ground

  smashed-hit the trees

  no-seems all right but its the
weirdest kind of machine ive ever seen
i didnt wait to examine it-just rode
back hell for leather to phone you i
thought you wouldnt want people nosing
about-might want it kept secret all
last nights row wasnt for nothing no
matter what the police say

  is it possible for it to take off from
there

  no fills the available space complete-
ly i should say

  colonel youve done splendidly-its
a mercy there was an experienced soldier
on the spot dont let a word get about
-ill be with you as fast as a car can take
me is it likely to be seen by any one
no-its in a lonely glade where very
few people ever go-no one at this hour
or season anyhow best come straight to
my house-wintram hall-and ill take
you with me

  right many thanks sir

  langton was soon on the road his
fast car was followed by an air force
moth



lorry filled with fully armed men whose
job was to deal with any show of resist-
ance on the part of the crew of the fallen
plane he had chosen to travel by car
because it would bring him right to
colonel butlers house and would attract
less attention than a plane and he was
above all anxious to preserve complete
secrecy both for technical and diplomatic
reasons the air ministry had no desire
that enterprising journalists should make
public the design of the secret extranian
plane and if the theory that extranian
pilots had been flying over london at
night proved correct public indignation
were the fact known might make it very
difficult for the government to preserve
the atmosphere of diplomatic good-will so
necessary for the handling of the present
crisis

it was still comparatively early and the
roads were fairly clear of traffic in
little over half an hour langtons car
turned in at the entrance gates of win-
tram hall under the portico of the old
georgian house a gray-haired soldierly
figure was awaiting him near by a
groom held two saddled horses

  as langton jumped from the car the
colonel came down the steps to meet him

  colonel butler

  yes i expect youre in a hurry to see
this thing you ride

  langton nodded and as they were
mounting the colonel explained that this
was their quickest method of approach-
ing the fallen machine they left the
grounds of the hall crossed the road
and were soon riding down narrow paths
between the trees where it was frequently
necessary to crouch in the saddle to avoid
overhanging branches they had the for-
est to themselves occasionally a rabbit
scurried across the path or a deer raised
a timid head from the green bracken

small birds twittered in the thickets and
blackbirds whistled mellowly now and
then but the full chorus of song was
over for the year the sun burned strong
in the open spaces the peace and quiet of
the whole scene struck langton as in
strange contrast to his errand there was
something ironical in the complete in-
difference of nature to the presence of the
instrument of death and destruction
which had fallen into this quiet forest
langton was listening to the crooning of
a dove hidden in the green boughs above
him when the colonel checked his horse
and made a sign to him to come along-
side

  they had arrived on the edge of an
open glade about fifty yards across it
was surrounded on all sides by tall beech-
es and oaks whose height formed a bar-
rier that no ordinary plane could sur-
mount without a much longer take-off
and in the center of this space seeming
to occupy most of it lay the most extraor-
dinary machine that langton had ever
seen

  the wings extended almost from side
to side of the glade and what struck
langtons expert eyes at once was the
fart that this was neither a biplane nor a
monoplane but something of both it had
two planes on either side of the body
but instead of being superimposed the
lower plane was practically on a level
with the upper behind which it extended
fanwise the confused metaphor that
rose in langtons mind was a four-
winged monoplane between the wings
the fuselage lay long and tapering a
glistening silver-gray it was wholly en-
closed no windows were visible and the
pilots quarters were apparently com-
pletely built in the under-carriage was
not visible being completely covered by
the downward spread of the four enor-
mous wings on the nose of the machine


weird tales

langton could see on the near side one
of those large globular disks which the
officer at manston had described as win-
dows they seemed to be constructed of a
cellular framework of metal with panes
of some glassy material but no light
came from them near these protuber-
ances were a number of complicated
pipe-like affairs the use of which it was
impossible to guess and in front of them
emerged two long tube-like appliances
which were folded back toward the
wings

there was no sign of life or movement
about the machine which lay apparently
as it had lighted

what dye make of it asked colonel
butler at last

the new extranian hush-hush plane
i think said langton trying to put his
horse toward it but both of the horses
were strangely restive and kept backing
into the shelter of the trees

i shouldnt go too near all at once
warned the colonel wheres the crew
training machine-guns on us maybe

no crew there said langton you
see all that stuff in the nose of the thing
--those long feelers and so on that ex-
plains it-its one of those automatic
planes controlled by wireless it may be
stuffed full of gas or high explosive of
course but theres nothing human in it
let us have a look

they dismounted and walked across
the still-dewy grass and as they did so
the huge size of the thing before them
became apparent the fuselage towered
above them like a house the expanse of
wing seemed colossal

damn it youd almost say it was
hairy said the colonel as he peered up
at the enormous body

thats all part of the wireless gadget
said langton well soon get the secret

of that how do we get into the thing
though

  youd want a ladder

  langton turned from his scrutiny of
the body and approached the edge of the
hinder plane he could not guess at the
construction of the wide laminated sur-
face the edge of which was fringed with
spikes set closely together

  youd better wait where you are
colonel he said as he stepped carefully
on to the wing just in case anything
happens

  he began walking over the plane the
surface was hard and slippery under his
feet here and there he could detect a
vein-like structure presumably of light
metal girder-work which kept the wing
rigid it was when he put his foot on one
of these concealed girders that a strange
thing happened a tremor seemed to go
through the entire machine langton was
puzzled for a moment then the explana-
tion seemed to be that the under-carriage
had been damaged in landing and that his
weight had upset the precarious balance
of the machine he went on and reached
the forward plane pausing to notice how
the rear plane fitted under the front one
so closely that they were almost in touch
it looked as if one could be slid under
the other and this structure puzzled him
but there would be plenty of time to go
into that he walked on till he came to the
junction of the planes with the body
here the body rose in a dome-like struc-
ture that offered no opening and seemed
impossible to climb the dome was cov-
ered with interlacing work of some kind
that looked like metal feathers which
presented a smooth gray surface of the
same color as the wings he had crossed

  he felt this surface with his hands to
his surprize it was strangely soft and
yielding he dug his fingers into it

  again a strange tremor ran through
moth



the entire structure but this time some-
thing further happened the two long
feelers that had been folded over the
wings suddenly shot forward and waved
to and fro in the air with a loud swish-
ing sound then something started in the
under-carriage the whole body shot up
several feet from the ground a strange
pulsating movement began in the wings
that nearly jerked langton off his feet
and for the first time in his life he was
seized with panic a wild unreasoning
panic that made him run for the edge of
the wing he was on a horrible notion
that this thing was alive filled his mind

  he ran for his life but just as he
reached the edge of the wing and was
about to jump to the solid ground the
wings with a mighty motion shot upward
over the top of the fuselage for a mo-
ment as he fell headlong through the
flexible spikes that fringed the wing he
thought that he had set in action some
mechanism for exploding a cargo of
destruction but no explosion followed
only as he lay face downward in the long
grass a rush of air almost lifted him from
the ground he could hear the branches
near him swaying in the gust of it then
all was silent he rolled over-the glade
was empty and only the crushed grass and
the figure of colonel butler standing
with his head craned backward remained
as evidence that the plane had ever been
there

  he scrambled to his feet and followed
the colonels gaze skyward far up in
the blue the great silver shape was rapid-
ly lessening as it rose and circled over the
forest higher and higher till it became
indistinguishable even in the depths of
his amazement langtons professional
eye noted instantly the peculiar bird-like
action of the wings which rose and fell
in long beats or trembled like a hovering
hawks in what seemed a few moments

it was out of sight the peace and silence
of the green forest were as if they had
never been disturbed

iangton hobbled over to the colonel
and stared at him the colonel re-
turned the stare then both of them turned
to where the terrified horses were tethered
to trees

  better come back with me and have a
drink said the colonel you took a
nasty toss

  in silence they mounted and rode back
to wintram hall lost in speculation that
neither liked to put into words

  do you want to do anything immedi-
ate about this asked the colonel as
they dismounted report i mean to say
or anything like that before lunch

  he avoided langtons eye as he spoke
but langton understood

  only to send my men back to lon-
don he said ill be glad to have lunch
here if its convenient

  the colonel went into the house to
give his instructions and langton inter-
viewed the men who stood grouped
round a service lorry on the drive it was
with a certain sense of relief that he heard
that nobody had seen anything of a
strange plane he explained that their
services would not be required any longer
and having dismissed them entered the
house he found the colonel pacing up
and down the hall as soon as langton
had removed the traces of his fall they
sat down to lunch in an oak-panelled
dining-room

  while the servants were in the room
they talked of other things but the colo-
nel was preoccupied in manner and
always seemed on the verge of saying
something which he did not say

  ive served in india a lot he came
out once and in west africa funny


weird tales

things happen there-things you wouldnt
believe if i told them

  so ive heard said langton

  and thats one reason went on the
colonel why i dont believe that any-
things impossible

  the butler had gone out of the room
langton looked straight at his host

  you mean he said slowly you
mean that the thing was alive

  the colonel nodded

  you couldnt see what i did when
you dug your fist into it-damn it it
stood up stood up sir on legs three
on each side-i counted them six legs-
you know what that is

  it might be a mechanical device of
some kind suggested langton uncer-
tainly

  no sir said the colonel fiercely
leaning forward as he spoke it was an
infernal great moth-thats what it was
ill show you presently i collect em in
the forest here since i retired im sup-
posed to be a bit of a dab at entomology
and i know

  but stammered langton admit-
ting it was alive how do you account for
the coldness of everything i touched-
seemed ice-cold

inseas have no blood like ours-they
have a circulating fluid but its cold it
would be cold-thats another proof
then how am i to report a thing like
that demanded langton unhappily

you cant said the colonel you
cant they wouldnt believe you-youd
be up before a medical board before
theyd got to the end of your report
what am i to do then

  if youre finished said the colonel
come into my study and ill show you
something keep my collection there
he led the way across the hall into a
room lined with cabinets and bookcases
from one of the cabinets he took a drawer

and carried it over to a table under the
window

  genus eupithecia he said we call
em pug moths in england

  langton found himself gazing down
on a neatly arranged collection of tiny
models of the mysterious plane the
resemblance was exact shape attitude
angle of the outspread wings and in
some nearly the color the eyes which he
had taken for windows the long antennae
the tapering body on six legs

  couldnt it be that some genius had
succeeded in discovering the secret of a
moths flight and in making a big scale
model he asked presently

  can a man imitate the works of god
so closely dye think asked the colo-
nel solemnly

  but these are so tiny-that was a
monstrous thing objected langton no
creature of that size could live on this
earth without being discovered

  the inference is theyve just arrived
on this earth said colonel butler grim-
ly its a bad lookout for us if they
have dye realize what sort of monster
the caterpillar of that thing would be eh
you know those caterpillars we call loop-
ers-kind that grips with its forelegs-
thats its real legs of course-and pulls
its long body up into a loop takes hold
with the claspers on its tail and then
reaches out again you remember-they
seem to take huge strides

  langton nodded

  i know them what size would the
caterpillar of that be

  about seventy-five feet long prob-
ably when it was full-grown it would
have jaws that could crush anything softer
than iron-maybe iron i doubt if a
machine-gun bullet could pierce its skin
langton threw out his arms despair-
ingly
moth



  were dreaming he said where
could they come from

  i dont know said the colonel
gloomily but theyve come light at-
tracts them-these little beggars come to
street lamps well the worlds a blaze
of light now in this age of electricity
theyre always boasting about

  you mean they might have been at-
tracted from some other planet that has
monstrous forms of life but thats not
credible-surely all the electric light in
the world going at full blast wouldnt be
noticed there

  we dont know what sort of sight
they may have in mars or any of the
others said the colonel and we dont
know what the flying range of such
things would be suppose they are flying
about in the upper air of which we know
damn little-they see all this glow at
night-down they come impossible it
may sound-but its feasible anyway
have you any better explanation

  no said langton i havent i
wish this discovery had fallen to some one
else colonel because im going to be
broken over it

  you mean youre going to report
what you saw asked the colonel

  its my duty theres a fearful dan-
ger in this thing if such creatures get a
footing on the earth-i can see that
there is said the colonel imagine
a batch of eggs-hundreds maybe-
hatching out and a horde of caterpillars
like that eating up the country they
might eat human beings-they might eat
anything-wood houses anything on
the other hand they might die for lack of
their proper food

  still ive got to report said lang-
ton and if youll excuse me ill get
back to the ministry and make my report
they wont believe it but its up to me

the colonel held out his hand and
gripped langtoris warmly

look here my boy he said gruffly
if-if any trouble comes out of it for
you rely on me in any way you think fit
you can use my name of course but it
wont carry you far-im looked upon as
an eccentric down here already because i
collect bugs but what i mean is-if they
-if they retire you or anything like that
-come down here and stop with me for
a bit we might think out something to
do about this-it may be a very real dan-
ger you know

if things turn out as they probably
will colonel said langton gratefully
i shall certainly come im a bachelor
and have no family ties so theres noth-
ing to hinder me unless they lock me in
an asylum and i want to go into this
thing with some one who knows it all
colonel butler stood for some time
gazing after the receding car and as he
turned to go indoors he was speaking to
himself

damned fine chap he said theyll
certify him when he comes out with that
story-sure thing

a few weeks later he read in the lon-
don gazette that air commodore lang-
ton had been invalided out of the service

	the egg

colonel butler had been surprized
and relieved at not being called to
give evidence in the official inquiry which
he knew had been held into his friends
sanity he guessed that langton had kept
his name out of it as far as possible also
that the authorities had not desired to
widen their inquiry beyond what was
strictly necessary-if it leaked out that
the officer who had been in charge of the
london defenses on that night of public
excitement had been found to be insane


weird tales

there would have been an outcry which
would have imperilled the positions of
many important people he understood
therefore well enough why he had not
been called upon but he was anxious
about the fate of the man for whom he
had formed an instinctive liking if he
had not volunteered any corroboration of
langtons fantastic report it was because
he had no desire to be certified himself
and because he foresaw possible con-
sequences of the visit of the giant moth
if the peril he feared materialized there
would be at least one man at liberty who
understood its cause and could suggest
how to deal with it and he had grave
reasons for believing that it might mate-
rialize nevertheless he was on the point
of setting out for london to make in-
quiries about his friend when he was
saved the trouble by a visit from a high
medical officer of the air service

  that officers arrival happened to coin-
cide with the return of the colonel from
a collecting expedition in the forest they
met outside the colonels door as the offi-
cer was stepping from his car and colo-
nel butler with a collecting-box hung
from his shoulder and a net in one hand
was mounting the steps the officer
introduced himself and indicated that his
visit was connected with langtons affair
he glanced at the colonels paraphernalia

  and i think he added if you will
forgive me that i see something that sug-
gests the origin of your friends un-
fortunate delusion

  you mean this asked the colonel
flourishing his net as he led the way to
his study well i know that the ig-
norant commonly regard entomologists as
eccentric or even potty as they express it
-but i didnt expea to find a medical
officer sharing that delusion sir

  the officer flushed and laughed as he

took the chair that the colonel had in-
dicated

im far from it i assure you he de-
clared as a matter of fact ive dabbled
a bit in entomology when i was on for-
eign service-youll find a collection of
mesopotamian moths at south kensing-
ton made by me

im glad to hear it said the colonel
with a slight increase of cordiality
because in that case youll perhaps ap-
preciate the proof i propose to show you
of langtons complete sanity where is
he now

he is in hospital under observation
at present and as for his sanity that ap-
pears to be unimpeachable except for this
extraordinary delusion that he saw a gi-
gantic moth in the forest here you can
imagine the effect of such a story on the
authorities and i dont blame them for
being inclined to have him certified for
delusion insanity is a terribly dangerous
thing you never know what the next
fixed idea may be the harley street men
we called in said he already showed signs
of the persecution mania

the colonel laughed

i should say he did was his com-
ment if you were locked up for report-
ing truthfully a thing youd seen i fancy
you would show signs of it yourself
but colonel-surely you dont sug-
gest-

what are you going to do with him
interrupted the colonel

well said his visitor failing to con-
ceal his embarrassment at the colonels
attitude thats what has brought me
here he asks us to allow him to come to
you and says that you are willing to look
after him personally id be inclined to
advise that if you are willing to accept
the responsibility we could run down
here and have a look at him now and
then it seems an extreme step to send
moth



an officer of his standing and record to an
asylum

  im perfectly willing to have him-
only too glad said the colonel

  you realize the responsibility-the
possible danger

  perfectly i realize other things too
sir one is the danger to the country if

i	dont get him here another is that you
think me as mad as langton well come
and look at this will you

  the medical officer followed the colo-
nel to a table which stood in the bay of
one of the windows on the table en-
closed in a rough cage of stout wire stood
a most remarkable-looking object at the
first glance the visitor took it for some
rare vase which his eccentric host had
caged in to prevent theft or breakage
indeed it resembled nothing so much as
a vase without handles it was about
eighteen inches high and perhaps a foot
in diameter at its widest point a rough
description of the shape would be that
of a ruby football set on end the beauty
of it was remarkable it seemed to be
composed of some rare pinkish marble
richly and curiously carved with geo-
metrical designs which were repeated over
the entire surface with faultless pre-
cision the top was closed and if it had
an opening anywhere it was concealed

  the visitor stared at this object with
mixed feelings of admiration for its
beauty and bewilderment at the colonels
conduct in connecting it with langton
what could be the connection between
this work of art and that officers sanity
what is it demanded the colonel
a rare vase of some kind i suppose
-and a remarkably beautiful thing
colonel

  the colonel frowned

  i thought you were an entomologist
sir he said please look again and

look carefully this time doesnt it recall
anything to your mind

the medical officer drew a chair up to
the table and sitting down began to
examine the object intently he turned
the wire cage this way and that scru-
tinized the surface with care lifted it and
weighed it in his hands while the colonel
looked on finally he replaced it and
pushing back his chair turned to his host

i think i see what you mean he said
it might be a very much enlarged model
of the egg of some lepidopterous insea
the colonel nodded

right he said only it isnt a
model it is an egg and im keeping it
in that wire cage till it hatches i dont
want a larva of that size loose in the
house

but its impossible

you may think so will it alter your
idea if i tell you that i was with langton
when he saw the moth in faa i dis-
covered it and mistook it for some new
kind of plane that had fallen in the for-
est i telephoned to him because i
thought theyd want it kept secret-he
came down and what he told you in his
report we saw together

his visitor was looking at him with
frank incredulity but the colonel went
on unabashed

when it came to me that the thing
was alive i made a rough guess that it
corresponded roughly to our genus
eupithecia and as the antennae were
not ciliated the inference was that it was
a female-the bulky body also suggested
that so while you were looking him up

i	made a search of the glade where it
alighted in the long grass i found that
and there you are

the officer began to look very uncom-
fortable he got up and crossed to the
fireplace

but how-supposing that we accept


weird tales

that you did see it-how did it get here
-where did it come from

  i expea langton explained our theory
in his report

  he did-and that seemed the maddest
part of it something about the country
being so brilliantly lit up at night and at-
tracting these things from some planet or
from the upper air

  well youre a praaical entomologist
-think it out and see if it doesnt fit in
there was silence for some moments
then the officer moved uneasily

  the funny thing about it is he said
that the night after a man was run in
for being drunk and disorderly he said
to the magistrate next day that he had
seen an enormous thing like a plane fall-
ing on the roof of mondaine mansions
that big block in park lane he got
fourteen days

  anything else you know asked the
colonel with interest

  i dont know said the officer could
this have any bearing on it the cap-
tain of the fanteric the big liner re-
ported that he ran into some big floating
objea in the channel a day or two later
which he thought must have been a dead
whale-only the lookout man said that
the sea on either side of it seemed to be
held down by two wing-shaped patches
of oil anyway it was cut up by the bows
of the ship and apparently sank but they
found traces of some glutinous substance
on the plates of the ship that certainly
wasnt the blood of a whale mystery of
the sea the papers called it

  that might account for one of them
said the colonel i must make inquiries
but the other-if there were only two-
where is it

  look here said the officer with a
gesture of perplexity you cant expea
me to go back to kingsway and father
this story nobody would-not even if

you produced that egg to the royal
society if nothing comes of it they
would all be branded as lunatics

  but something may come of it said
the colonel suppose theyve been scat-
tering eggs all over the place these
larvae would be fairly formidable things
what

  ill do this said his visitor after a
pause ill send langton down here dis-
charged as cured and you and he can work
on it if there are any developments ill
count on you to let me know at once
langton ought to be reinstated immedi-
ately but till theres some convincing
proof you can see how impossible that
is

  well said the colonel thats the
best thing you can do ive no doubt
but meantime i have drawn up a full re-
port of the whole thing i sent it to the
prime minister last night-it was my
duty to the nation and to langton how
hell take it of course i dont know

  but you can guess said the other
very well-well leave it like that colo-
nel if the p m knows its out of my
hands and thats a comfort langton will
be sent down to you today hell be a bit
under the weather anyhow after the
ordeal hes been through-youd better
feed him up and let him rest a bit

on that understanding they parted
that evening a car brought lang-
ton to wintram hall he was pale and
obviously suffering from strain and the
colonel packed him off to bed refusing
to discuss anything till he had eaten a
good meal and had a sound sleep it
was noon of the following day before he
came downstairs but his host noted with
delight that he looked almost as well and
alert as on the occasion of his first visit

  the long discussions that followed
served little purpose but to make clear to
moth



the two men the nature of the dilemma
in which they were involved it seemed
impossible to do anything further in a
public manner-the fate that had over-
taken langton in consequence of his re-
port was sufficient proof of that and
until they were made aware of the man-
ner in which the prime minister was
going to treat the colonels communica-
tion any other move was worse than use-
less then there had been no further
reports of the presence of the strange vis-
itors they might still be hidden some-
where or they might have returned to the
regions from which they came although
the colonels investigations in the affair
of the fanteric revealed the fact that a
quantity of strange bony framework had
been washed ashore in sussex and that a
mysterious scum had appeared on the sea
in the same neighborhood mixed with
entrail-like fragments this suggested
that one of the wanderers perhaps ex-
hausted by the lack of some natural el-
ement required for its sustenance had
fallen exhausted into the sea and been
destroyed by the ship but that was only
a likely speculation and what had
become of the other that they never
knew either it perished unseen or re-
turned to its native element

  if the creatures had died or left the
earth the remaining danger was that ovae
had been deposited during their visit and
might eventually hatch out larvae whose
size and destructiveness would be a ter-
rible danger to mankind that one egg
had been left behind they had proof-
it reposed in the colonels study a wide
search of the neighborhood had revealed
no others and there might be no others
but the probability was that they had dis-
turbed the moth at the beginning of its
operations and that it had completed them
elsewhere in which case hundreds of
these eggs must be in existence that

could only be found out when the time
for the emergence of the larvae arrived
and that they hoped to learn from the
solitary specimen they had

  there was in the meantime therefore
nothing for them to do but think out pos-
sible plans of destroying the brood when
it hatched and was discovered but a few
comparative experiments with living in-
seas made it plain that caterpillars of
such a size would possess enormous
strength and that their skins would prob-
ably be tough enough to turn any bullet
aside

  how was such a danger to be dealt
with it was to this problem that the two
friends turned their attention in the weeks
that followed and without any assurance
of success

  about a fortnight after langtons re-
turn to wintram hall they received a
visit from the medical officer who had
previously consulted colonel butler about
his friend nothing beyond a brief offi-
cial acknowledgment had resulted from
the colonels letter to the prime min-
ister and he had been forced to the con-
clusion that he was regarded as one of
those harmless lunatics who pester the
great with their effusions he and lang-
ton were in the study when the visitor
was shown in and the colonels welcome
was not any too cordial

  you dont mean to tell me that
theyve sent you down to inspect langton
after all he growled

  youll still find me suffering as bad-
ly as ever from the same delusion lang-
ton added before the other could reply

  sorry about all that you know lang-
ton said the officer patiently but as
things were it couldnt be helped no
sir he went on turning to the colonel
it is not about that-its about your let-
ter to the prime minister

  the colonel sat up


weird tales

  yes sir the p m naturally enough
turned it over to the air ministry the
fat was in the fire as you can guess
they could not very well ask the p m to
believe that langton and you and my-
self for of course i told them what id
seen were all mad there was the devil
to pay-the p m called for a full report
of the whole affair said he had talked
to langton that morning and found him
perfectly sane he threatened to retire all
sorts of important bugs and gave every
one a dressing down the upshot is that
he has appointed a sort of committee of
scientific big-wigs to consider the possi-
bilities so far all theyve done is to say
its impossible but the p m says every-
thing is possible till the contrary is
proved-and im here as the forerunner
of the committee and the p m himself
they want to see the egg

  instinctively the gaze of the three men
turned to the object on the table in the
window but something had happened to
it from a hole near the top of it a
shining horny head armed with com-
plicated and formidable jaws projected
emerging farther at every moment they
rushed to the table and watched with a
horrible fascination the long eel-like body
pushing itself forth till finally the thing
grasping the broken edge of the shell
with its hind claspers was fully born

  the young caterpillar they saw sur-
passed so greatly in size anything of the
kind ever seen by men that it seemed like
the creature of a nightmare its body
about two feet in length projected stiffly
from the tail claspers by which it held on
to the egg at an angle of about forty-five
degrees it was a dark-reddish color with
a rough horny skin on which the rows
of breathing-follicles were clearly visible
and looked like nothing so much as a
branch of a tree

  what is it demanded the medical
officer at last

  might be a gigantic variant of the
genus eupithecia going by the old classi-
fication said the colonel in faa it
might be a huge subumbrata-the color-
ing of the parent and of this caterpillar
distinaly suggest subumbrata curiously
enough the glade between beechwoods
in which we saw the thing is just exaaly
where you might find our tiny eupithecia
subumbrata but to a thing of that size
our beech trees would look like seed-
lings

  hes going to move shouted lang-
ton as he spoke the creature began to
sway its extended body to and fro as if
seeking for a hold for the six legs near
its head and the colonel snatched the
wire cage away the long body bent
down to the surface of the table found a
footing there for the forelegs and drew
itself up into a loop which brought the
hind claspers against the forelegs the
head then shot forth secured a hold and
the tail was drawn up to it again in the
familiar method of looper caterpillars
but in each of these strides the creature
covered about two feet of ground and the
movements were performed with in-
credible rapidity before the watchers
realized what was happening it was on
the floor and looping its way across the
carpet at a great speed

  the three men backed away from it
with pale horror-stricken faces

  do you realize that it may grow to
fifty meet or more gasped the colonel
imagine hundreds of them loose in the
country-theyd devastate a county in a
week

  theyre big enough to provide a good
target suggested langton

  yes but once theyre half-grown
howre you going to kill them de-
manded the colonel bullets from any
moth



ordinary firearm wouldnt pierce them-
youd need artillery youd need to
evacuate the country and send out an
army against them

  i-i suppose theyre not carnivorous
anyhow said the medical officer

  god knows what they eat in the moon
or mars or wherever theyve come from
groaned the colonel but we must chain
this fellow up before he starts on my
carpet

  he slipped off his coat and threw it
over the caterpillar muffling its head
carefully but even then it required all
his strength to wrench its hind claspers
from the carpet they came away with
bits of the material attached

  he rushed out of the house with the
writhing creature in his hands followed
by the others in the stableyard was a
brick shed with a corrugated-iron roof
and a stout door into this they thrust the
caterpillar and locked the door first
flinging in half a dozen cabbages which
the colonel pulled ruthlessly from the
kitchen garden then three greatly
shaken men they returned to the house
but this time it was to the dining-room
that they went where the colonel pro-
duced the whisky decanter they helped
themselves generously and drank in si-
lence

 t ell said the medical officer
y y presently there is nothing for
me to do here the p m and his scien-
tific big bugs are coming to see you on
friday meantime i shall tell them what
ive seen-and as for the air ministry
ill quote hamlet to them-but it wont
have any effect im afraid

  with this he took his leave

  shortly afterward the two friends set
out on another exploration of the region
in which the egg had been found but a
prolonged search of the grass and the

  trees in the neighboring parts of the for-
est revealed nothing they returned tired
and exhausted and sat late over an excel-
lent dinner discussing the subject that
was foremost in their thoughts

before they retired langton suggested
that they might take another look at the
shed in the stable yard

just what i was thinking myself
said the colonel hes safe enough in
there of course but we dont know what
he is capable of consuming in the way of
food let us collect a few more cabbages
and throw them in shall we in the
morning i propose to photograph him

i	wish we had thought of doing it when
he was first hatched-it would have been
useful as a record of growth

the night was cloudy and dark but
with the aid of two powerful electric
torches they raided the kitchen garden
again and proceeded to the shed the
colonel unlocked the stout door and flung
it open while langton flashed his torch
round the interior

it was empty

its gone cried langton they
entered the shed and closed the door
while they turned the torches upon every
cranny and corner that could hide the
creature it was not there

my god cried the colonel sudden-
ly look at that

he pointed at a little heap of brick
dust at the foot of the back wall and
then at a hole eaten through the brick-
work above it here and there there
were deep scores in the bricks round this
point as if they had been gnawed by some
animal on the floor lay the droppings of
the caterpillar the cabbages had only
been partly consumed

do you understand what this means
asked colonel butler almost in a whis-
per it means that these things can eat
brick-ic has eaten and digested brick-


weird tales

work-the droppings prove that but
after all is that more impossible than
their size the little forms of this crea-
ture that we know in this world live on
vegetable matter which is derived from
the earth-might not a gigantic and more
robust digestive system deal with the earth
itself even in the form of brick and
stone

  langton stared at him with fear in his

eyes

  suppose they began to attack houses

  you see for yourself what would
happen replied the colonel i sup-
pose we had better make a search for it
-but it may be miles away by now
travelling at that rate and if its near we
shall never find it in the dark

  nevertheless they made what search
they could with the aid of the torches but
it was fruitless their prisoner had
escaped and they never saw it again
there was nothing to be done but to
await developments

next morning there was a letter for
the colonel from the prime min-
ister it was a brief communication stat-
ing that he had heard of the hatching of
the egg and confirming his visit at the end
of the week meantime he urged upon
the colonel and langton the extreme un-
desirability of starting a scare among the
public and enjoined secrecy the com-
mittee he had got together had expressed
the opinion that if such creatures had
reached the earth-a possibility which
they did not accept-the conditions would
be so different from those of their native
habitat that they would certainly perish
in a very short time and this would apply
to the larvae if any were hatched it
seemed therefore the prime minister
wrote that any idea of real danger to the
community might be dismissed and that
to avoid wild and exaggerated reports

nothing had better be done or said at
present the committee would look at
the egg and inspect the spot on which it
was found he wished to be present at
these investigations himself and his first
available day was friday

  the real meaning of that lies between
the lines said langton when the colo-
nel had finished reading this communica-
tion aloud it means that those old fos-
sils dont believe a word of the story and
think that we have faked this egg our-
selves when they hear that the cater-
pillar has escaped theyll nod their
sapient heads and say quite in tri-
umphant fashion

  the colonel nodded

  thats about the size of it im
afraid he agreed very well let the
p m and his friends have it their own
way our orders are to do nothing-
good well obey them but i tell you
what we can do langton and thats keep
a lookout

  how dye mean

  in the press ive ordered all the lon-
don papers to be delivered here every day
and most of the important provincial
journals as well now i suggest that we
go through them every day and cut out
anything that might have the remotest
bearing on the presence of these crea-
tures i mean to say the connection
might not be obvious at once-well have
to weigh every item of home news with
reference to a possible bearing

  langton thought the idea a good one
and welcomed it as a relief from the
monotony of inaction they spent that
morning going through the newspapers
and most of the afternoon as well but
the result was nil

  next day however the search yielded
something that might be a possibility
the colonel looked up from the times
w t-
moth



in which he was immersed at the sound
of langtons scissors

  struck something he asked eagerly

  listen to this said langton its the
express ghost in epping forest yester-
day afternoon two men arrived at the
robin hood inn in an exhausted and ter-
rified state telling an incoherent story of
having seen a ghost in monks wood
where they had been resting they said
they had run for over a mile in their ter-
ror and were in such a collapsed condi-
tion that the landlord supplied them with
brandy at his own charge the men who
were of the tramp class stated that they
were on their way to london from the
north and had camped in the wood for
their midday meal they were unable to
describe what they had seen clearly but
said that something horrible had looked
at them from a tree overhead one said
it looked like the devil and the other
described it as a huge horny face they
declined to report the matter to the police
and shortly afterward proceeded to lon-
don by bus local opinion is skeptical as
to the presence of a ghost or a monster
in monks wood one of the finest natural
preserves in the forest the police believe
that they were the victims of a practical
joke and the more cynical members of
the force suggest that the whole affair was
an ingenious method of obtaining drink
at the expense of the landlord of the
robin hood 

  sounds like our escaped friend said
the colonel wed better file that and
have a look at monks wood ourselves
but the visit to monks wood yielded
no trace of the missing caterpillar next
days paper however yielded one or two
paragraphs on the same subject and men-
tioned other reports of picnickers and
pedestrians in the forest having been
scared by strange sounds and sights by
the third day the epping forest mystery
w t-

had become news but the press treated
it as a subject for humor and accused the
inhabitants of trying to advertise their
neighborhood at the expense of the sea-
side resorts the telegraph pointed out
that the best that the seaside could do
was a sea-serpent and that was not due
till august whereas here were the propri-
etors of swings and roundabouts and tea
gardens trying to draw custom by pro-
claiming the arrival of a land serpent of
terrifying dimensions for such was the
description given by one party

  but on friday morning the press had
changed its tone the penny papers and
flaring headlines announcing a dastard-
ly outrage in epping forest late on
the previous night three motor coaches
conveying excursionists to london passed
through the village of epping at a fast
speed a mile or two farther on the lead-
ing coach struck an unseen obstacle which
killed the driver and ripped the entire
top from the chassis causing numerous
casualties among the passengers the fol-
lowing coach swerved out to avoid a col-
lision and ran into the same obstacle with
nearly similar results and the third
vehicle so quickly did the whole thing
happen was unable to pull up and
crashed into the wreckage when the
police and the ambulances reached the
spot an appalling scene was revealed by
the headlights of the numerous cars now
stopped dead and injured lay all over
the road and in the wreckage of the
coaches and the cause of the accident was
plainly revealed by the fragments of a
cable of some very strong but unknown
substance attached to tree trunks on either
side of the highway

  an outrage that could only have been
planned by fiends as one paper put it
certainly seemed a just description of the
affair that it was a carefully thought-
out affair seemed certain to the press


weird tales

the cable was of a substance unknown to
industry or science and of great strength
first investigations suggested that it was
composed of some combination of the
materials that go to make artificial silk
and it had been fixed to trees on either
side by adhesive of mysterious nature
the whole affair was obviously the work
of enemies of society perfectly innocent
and harmless holiday-makers had been
massacred and maimed with the most
callous cruelty public opinion was imme-
diately aflame suspicion centered upon
bolshevist agents and the communist
party was accused of participation in the
outrage communists clubs and commit-
tee rooms were wrecked by angry crowds
an attack was made upon the russian
embassy and many innocent people were
injured and hunted through the streets

  search of the forest by day revealed no
hidden anarchists but a strong police
patrol was put upon all main roads

colonel butler and langton
although they were living not very
far from the scene of this affair heard
nothing of it till the following morning
when the colonels butler brought him
the papers with his morning tea he was
still absorbing the details when langton
came into the room with his tea in one
hand and a paper in the other

  you know what this is cried the
colonel waving his paper in the air

  i do said langton gravely it was
a thread spun by one of those infernal
creatures from one tree to another of
course it would be invisible at night and
of course it would be frightfully strong
thisll happen again unless something is
done about it surely this will make the
authorities do something

  not a hope asserted the colonel
theyve made up their minds that were
madmen or fakers-people in that frame

of mind are not capable of making deduc-
tions you see what they say-the work
of communists and anarchists why
should communists want to murder
coachloads of working people where
did they get this mysterious cable thats
baffling the experts what fools people
are langton and here are we con-
demned to sit here till tomorrow when
the prime minister is bringing his com-
mittee of old wives to mumble over it
perhaps they wont come at all now
this paper put two and two together
to some extent said langton listen
it is impossible not to connect this out-
rage with the mysterious reports of the
haunting of the forest by terrifying crea-
tures which have been current for some
days no doubt the perpetrators of the
crime required some days to perfect their
arrangements and took that means of scar-
ing away unwanted observers but it is
too late to search the forest now the
criminals have undoubtedly put a safe
distance between them and the scene of
their devilish activities

  whereas said the colonel the real
criminals are still on the spot-they are
lying by day extended along the branches
and trunks of trees so like them in sub-
stance that it is almost impossible to de-
tect them even if youre looking for them
and nobodys looking for them-theyre
chasing innocent communists and threat-
ening amazed russians i tell you what
langton im not anxious to die before
my time and im not going out into the
forest myself till weve seen the prime
minister and found out what hes going
to do dye realize that one of those fel-
lows could practically bite your head off
in any case said langton i cant
go against the p ms orders-id lose
my last hope of professional reinstate-
ment if i did well sit tight till he comes
moth



tomorrow weve warned him and the
responsibility isnt ours now

  next morning the press sensations were
unabated a constant patrol of the for-
est roads had been maintained but in spite
of the vigilance of the police two new
cables were found laid across the high-
ways in a precisely similar manner an
order was issued closing all roads in the
district to traffic by night meantime panic
had spread among the inhabitants the
wildest and most incredible stories were
flying about of a non-human monster hid-
ing in the woods and of extraordinary
sounds rising from the thickets after
dark

about eleven oclock a number of cars
- arrived at wintram hall bringing
the prime minister and his committee as
well as several high officers of the army
and air force it was a hot and rather
misty july morning without a breath of
wind and from the terrace which com-
manded a wide view of the forest mile
upon mile of woodland could be seen
shimmering in the heat haze which
obscured the distant outlines

  the colonel received his visitors as
they alighted and conducted them to the
study where the necessary introductions
were effected the experts who formed
the committee were professor meakerly
a famous biologist and two eminent
members of the royal entomological
society these gentlemen at once asked
to see the egg

  they subjected it to a careful scrutiny
while the prime minister was talking to
the colonel and langton and the officers
he had brought with him

  you may be surprized to see these
gentlemen he said referring to the lat-
ter but it is my intention when we have
looked into this affair of the egg to in-
vestigate this other mystery of the forest

in fact as soon as the mist clears a
thorough examination of the forest will
be made from the air-it may afford a
clue to the presence of the miscreants re-
sponsible for the outrages

langton and the colonel stared at the
speaker but before they could say any-
thing an interruption came from the
scientists

and now may we see the caterpillar
please asked the biologist

unfortunately it escaped the same
night said the colonel we made a
search but it was hopeless

quite said the biologist and the
three exchanged glances was it not
confined in any way

yes in a brick and iron shed re-
plied the colonel it gnawed through
the bricks and got away

it eats bricks then queried one of
the entomologists with a half-smile

it does replied the colonel stout-
ly for not only did it get out but it had
been eating the walls in a lot of places-
and it not only eats brick but digests it
as its droppings prove

a truly remarkable caterpillar said
the other entomologist and there was a
general laugh i dont know that we
need take up any more of colonel but-
lers no doubt valuable time he con-
tinued but it might be interesting to see
this shed-and the digested brickwork
by all means said the colonel but
you have examined the egg-perhaps
you would be good enough to say what
you make of that

the three looked at each other and
then the biologist replied

we propose to take a portion of it
with us for analysis he said with heavy
sarcasm i have seen an enlarged model
of the egg of a lepidopterous insea which
was fashioned of material obtained by
calcining gypsum until it had become


weird tales

partially dehydrated and the addition of
a little coloring matter it was a remark-
ably good imitation of this of course
genuine object

  in other words you suggest that it is
made of plaster of paris said the colo-
nel with a smile very good-it is not
for me to suggest that such an eminent
authority might be mistaken he was
about to say more when a surprizing
interruption came from his friend

  by jove exclaimed langton plas-
ter of paris-that gives me an idea
inquiring glances were turned upon
him but he relapsed into silence the
colonel seeing that he did not want to
be questioned proposed that they should
now examine the shed

  excellent exclaimed the biologist
who was nettled by the colonels reply
thats just what we want to do to com-
plete our inquiry has any objection oc-
curred to you colonel he asked as the
colonel seemed to hesitate

  no burst out that honest soldier
angrily i only want to say first that it
passes my comprehension how the prime
minister for whose common sense i have
always had the greatest respect can allow
himself to be so far deluded by the
skepticism of this committee as not to see
for himself the connection between the
appearances of these moths and these so-
called outrages in the forest which he
says he is going to investigate why the
things as plain as the nose on my face to
any one whos not prejudiced

  the prime minister flushed the mem-
bers of the committee exchanged smiles

  kindly explain yourself colonel
said the prime minister with dignity

  sir said the colonel forgive me if
i spoke impatiently and if i make my ex-
planation elementary if one egg has
been laid probably hundreds have prob-
ably you remember from boyhood what

a looper caterpillar is like well these
are gigantic loopers-that lie concealed
during the day by their very resemblance
to tree trunks or branches if any danger
threatens them-they can spin threads
strong enough to bear their own weight
and a good deal more the cable that
those cars ran into was nothing but a
thread made by one of them from one
tree to another the horny heads like
devils that people say they have seen-
isnt that obvious didnt one of your
airmen report yesterday that he saw noth-
ing suspicious in the forest but that there
was a spot that looked as if it had been
burned recently if any one had had
courage to explore that burned area he
would have found that it wasnt burned
but simply eaten out by these creatures

  that the prime minister was impressed
by the colonels sincerity was obvious
he turned frowning to the men of science
but as he did so he cast a startled glance
at the window

  what is happening out there he
demanded the colonel ran to the french
windows and flung them open and the
whole party followed him out on to the
terrace

  a rapidly growing crowd of obviously
frightened people was gathering on the
colonels lawns from which as from the
terrace a wide view of the forest could be
obtained their gaze was directed on one
section of the woodland about a mile
away in which despite the windless
morning a strange agitation was visible
among the trees on the still morning
air curious tearing and rending sounds
were audible as of tom and snapped
branches tree tops disappeared before
the watchers eyes leaving gaps in the
greenery in which long writhing forms
were visible occasionally a long eel-like
body appeared above the trees waving to
and fro it would descend on a mass of
moth



foliage which in a short space of time had
disappeared altogether

the prime minister and his commit-
tee gazed in astonishment at the
scene-colonel butler had slipped away
from the group and returning in a few
moments he distributed field glasses
amongst them the prime minister the
biologist and one of the other experts
snatched them eagerly and focussed them
on the disturbed area

  now do you believe asked the
colonel after a few moments the biol-
ogist lowered his glasses and turned to
him

  i do he said simply and i offer
you and commodore langton my sin-
cerest apologies there is no doubt that
there is a brood of creatures like gigantic
caterpillars in the trees there-and by
jove they are making short work of the
forest

  the colonel nodded he was not the
man to maintain a grudge

  thats all right sir he said the
things too incredible for any one to
swallow without proof but the question
now is how are we going to deal with
them i estimate theyll grow to at least
seventy-five feet-i dont know how
youre going to kill them short of artil-
lery

  is there danger to human life asked
the prime minister the biologist re-
plied

  terrible danger i should say if they
break out of there-and if theyre not all
destroyed youll have another brood
hatching out in time they might wipe
out human life and human houses not to
speak of destroying vegetation to the last
leaf

  has any one a suggestion

  i have sir said an air officer let

me telephone for a squadron of bombers
and bomb them out

  the effect would be to destroy the
forest-and there would be a possible
loss of human life objected the politi-
cian i cant take such an extreme meas-
ure without consulting my colleagues in
the cabinet and the control of the for-
est is vested by act of parliament in the
corporation of london-they must be
consulted and a public warning must be
given first in any case

  do you realize sir what the danger
really is asked the colonel imagine
these creatures say fifty feet long and
stronger than anything we can conceive
of emerging from the forest on the
neighboring towns and villages we have
seen that they can eat anything-why one
of them might devastate a village in an
hour

  but the nature of the whole question
was strange to the prime minister and his
imagination refused to function with
sufficient range the first consideration
with him was the fear of public opinion
and its repercussion at the approaching
elections he shook his head

  we must make haste slowly colo-
nel he said let all preparations be
made by the air ministry for dealing
with the creatures by bombing-but noth-
ing must be done without my express
sanction and my sanction for the ruthless
destruction of londons finest playground
will not be given except in the last emer-
gency by the look of it there is enough
food there for these creatures for many
days to come i shall return to london
and summon the cabinet at once

  dont forget sir urged the colonel
that theyre growing every day their
progress tomorrow will be twice what it
is today

  i shall lose no time be assured of
that was the reply and they all had to


weird tales

be contented with that it was arranged
that an air observation patrol should be
maintained till a decision had been come
to and that a certain force of infantry
should be drafted to the forest area with
instructions to shoot the creatures on
sight the prime minister then took his
departure with the committee

the colonel groaned as he and lang-
ton watched the departing cars

its sheer suicide he exclaimed my
god fancy thinking of votes at a mo-
ment like this however there it is-and
if they wont have lunch we may as well
while we have a roof over our heads
they went to the dining-room and
before they had finished their meal they
heard through the open windows the
droning of airplanes which were circling
over the forest and dispatching wireless
reports momentarily to headquarters

a few bombs dropped now in the
middle of that brood would do the trick
remarked langton as they looked on
but when they get a little bigger theyll
separate

the colonel agreed

judging by the size of these fellows
out there he said they either grow at a
colossal speed or theyre an earlier brood
than our egg hillo hear that the
troops have arrived on the scene eh
the sound of scattered firing in cu-
rious wooden thuds came to their ears
from the forest below the colonel got
up eagerly

i say he exclaimed let us go down
and have a look at this-reminds me of
old times

 the death grapple

they made their way down to the
forest dense crowds of sightseers
thronged the roads despite the warn-
ings of the police patrols press men

and press photographers hung about
hoping to hear or see something sensa-
tional but no one was allowed to leave
the roadways and when the colonel and
langton tried to penetrate the woods in
the direction of the firing they were
promptly halted by the military not
even the colonels rank and standing as a
local magistrate would have been of avail
had not a hot and perspiring officer
emerged from the thicket and overheard
the argument

  im sorry sir he said to the colonel
but i cant let you through-orders are
absolutely stria were aaually in aaion
and theres considerable danger from
stray bullets

  doing any good asked langton
not the least grumbled the officer
might as well use pea-shooters bullets
bounce off them so far as i can see only
sting them up and annoy them theyve
done for one or two men already i mean
to say one of the fellows saw one stand-
ing up like a tree trunk and fired at it-
the thing switched about and came down
on him with its forelegs-picked him up
and dropped him with all his ribs broken
another hit a man when it was swaying
about and knocked him against a tree-
killed were simply stirring them up
hm said the colonel i doubt if its
wise suppose you start them travelling
how are you going to stop them

  cant said the officer theyve
started already in places we had a firing-
line and the damned things simply stepped
over it never saw anything like it-
dye know some of them must be getting
on for forty or fifty feet theyre simply
eating the heart out of the forest as if it
were a cabbage

  they should be bombed out said
langton

  of course agreed the soldier but
would you believe it the city corporation
moth



object nobody seems to realize what
were up against dye know that theyre
running excursions from london to see
the strange monsters as they call them
look at this mob-out for a picnic youd
think

  with that he left them and they de-
tached themselves from the crowd and
made their way back to wintram hall the
colonel full of gloomy prognostications
as to what would happen if the authorities
did not wake up to the danger they were
met in the hall by an excited butler

  sir he cried they say that the crea-
tures are moving through the forest south-
ward and that the armys got a battery of
artillery on the golf course at chingford
to meet them if they come out

  ah said the colonel then some
ones taken charge at last thats the best
thing they could do-get them in the open
and blow them to bits tell jones to get
the car ready-well run down to ching-
ford as soon as weve had a cup of tea and
see how things are

  but when the car emerged on the high-
road they found it blocked by a surging
mass of fugitives on foot in cars in
motor coaches and every kind of vehicle
all making in common panic for the shel-
ter of london terrifying stories were
current of the oncoming of a horde of
death-dealing monsters hundreds of sol-
diers it was rumored had been killed and
the creatures were proof against bullets
they could tear down houses and devour
their inhabitants people were leaving
their dwellings and joining the fleeing
mob women were screaming in terror and
white-faced men were forcing their way
through the throng an occasional burst
of rifle fire from the trees only served to
quicken the panic it was over an hour
before the colonels car moving at a
snails pace managed to traverse the few
miles to chingford and the colonel and

langton leaving it among the trees in
charge of the chauffeur managed to find
a footing on the hill behind the forest
hotel

  from this point they commanded a view
of the open plain and the great stretch of
forest to the north across the golf course
a battery of quick-firers was drawn up in
the open the gunners at the ready they
were supported by lines of troops lying
on the grass the terrified inhabitants of
the village on the edge of the golf course
stood at their windows or in their gardens
staring in astonishment at these war-like
preparations others were loading their
cars with valuables in readiness for imme-
diate flight

  but the little group of cooler spectators
on the hill had their eyes fixed upon the
dense green sea of the forest the same
strange agitation among the trees that they
had seen farther north that morning the
colonel and langton now saw again not
very far away accompanied by the same
rending and crashing sounds but it was
obvious that the center of the disturbance
was moving southward toward them now
and then volleys of rifle fire broke out
above the falling trees great writhing
shapes appeared and withdrew

  whoevers handling this job knows
what hes doing said the colonel you
hear that firing-first on one flank and
then on the other hes shepherding them
down to the guns-may not be able to kill
them but hes got them on the run-and
by jove theyre coming pretty fast

he had scarcely spoken when the first
of the monsters appeared on the
edge of the forest a vast columnar shape
rose above the thicket of thorn bushes that
fringed the trees and bowed its head down
to take a foothold on the grass of the open
plain in an instant the giant loop was
drawn up and the creature had thrust its
weird tales

length forward again taking forty feet in
its stride the speed at which it progressed
seemed incredible behind it other vast
shapes could be seen twisting and writh-
ing through the trees

  faint and thin in the distance they heard
a word of command there was a flash
from one of the guns followed by the
thud of the explosion and by the crash of a
bursting shell

  good man breathed the colonel as
a cloud of dust and smoke rose from the
ground just where the advancing cater-
pillar was taking a fresh foothold the
creature reared on its hind claspers swayed
for a moment and then fell like a falling
factory chimney the long body thrashed
to and fro on the grass in the muscular
contortions of death a cheer went up
from the onlookers

  but now the whole brood about a hun-
dred in number had broken from the
cover of the trees and was looping toward
the guns with frightening velocity it is
almost impossible to give any adequate
idea of the terrifying nature of the specta-
cle that confronted the gunner and the
trembling crowds huge eel-like bodies
some forty or fifty feet in length towered
in the air or flung themselves in gigantic
looping strides toward the line of artillery
these bodies were a dull red they were
surmounted by flattish horny heads armed
with formidable pincer-like jaws and
cavernous mouths three pairs of many-
jointed legs of shining horny substance
immediately behind the head tore the
surface of the ground they descended
upon like the automatic diggers used in
excavation such a spectacle had never
before been seen by human eyes beside
them the soldiers looked like pigmies and
their guns like toys

  yet true to their traditions the men of
the british army stood firmly to their
guns there was no flinching but here

and there a cockney flung a jesting re-
mark to his comrades

  theyre leaving it too late growled
the colonel as he watched the mass of
looping shapes bearing down upon the
artillery but even as he spoke a sheet of
flame sprang from the line of guns and the
roll of their fire reverberated in his ears
from the clouds of smoke and earth
thrown up by the bursting shells huge
writhing shapes shot up like the tentacles
of a stricken octopus wavered in the air
and then fell with heavy thuds that could
be felt and heard one huge form bore
through the smoke and grasping a gun in
its enormous arms flung it into the air
another swinging its body in the death
agony fell upon a gun and its crew and
obliterated them one or two others
stepped right over the battery in one gi-
gantic stride but now men of the infantry
in reserve ran forward and attacked them
with mills bombs of high destructive
power and one by one the great creatures
swayed stumbled and collapsed with great
rents torn in their sides from which a
green liquid poured in floods in a very
short space of time the affair was over the
plain was piled with battered shapes still
writhing as life ebbed from them and still
dangerous to approach dead and injured
men were being attended to on the ground
and hurried into waiting ambulances but
a huge sigh of relief went up from the
watching crowd as they realized that the
danger had been magnificently overcome

  presently long lines of bombers con-
verged on the forest and disappeared into
its recesses an occasional explosion could
be heard as they carried out their task of
running down any stragglers from the
main brood of the creatures that had
seemed to threaten the human race

  langton turned to his friend

  that was jolly well handled he said
moth



with heart-felt relief the danger is over
if that was the only brood

  yes replied the colonel the
armys not played out yet when it comes
to a job of work but is it the only brood
i hope so-and it probably is after all
only one pair was seen

  and one of the pair is dead we know
-the other has probably perished also
by this time or returned to the upper re-
gions yes-the chances are a million to
one that this is the last of them

  they disentangled themselves from the
crowd and went home ail access to the
field of action being forbidden by the mili-
tary this was necessary for every now
and then a long body would heave itself
up from the pile of shattered monsters
and thrash to and fro in an expiring con-
vulsion and whenever this happened
bombers ran forward to dispatch it

  that night there were scenes of the
wildest rejoicing in the streets of london
and the suburbs when the news came
through of the destruction of the whole
horde of monsters which had threatened
the safety of perhaps even london itself
the people swarmed into the thorough-
fares and abandoned themselves to maf-
ficking the authorities made no attempt
to interfere beyond checking the alcohol-
inspired excess of the wilder spirits the
papers poured out edition after edition de-
scribing the battle of chingford and spe-
cials containing news of the destruction of
yet another monster in the depths of the
forest the news flashed found the world
brought with it a wave of relief to other
nations for the tidings of the last few days
had revealed to scientists everywhere a
threat to the very existence of mankind

in the warm dusk of the july night the
colonel and langton were sitting in
the garden of wintram hall smoking
their final cigars they could hear dimly

the sounds of general rejoicing bonfires
blazed and rockets soared into the dark-
ness faint sounds of singing came from
the neighboring village

the colonel flung away the stump of
his cigar and rose from his chair he stood
sniffing the air for a moment

although its such a hot night lang-
ton he said presently i think we
should keep our windows shut can you
smell anything

langton became aware of a slight but
horribly sickly odor mingling with the
scent of the flowers he looked inquir-
ingly at his friend

what did you expect asked the
colonel as he led the way indoors that
great heap of dead caterpillars-hun-
dreds of tons there must be-putrefying
itll be worse tomorrow

down the valley of the lea toward
london the smell was stealing almost im-
perceptibly but becoming momentarily
stronger a slight northerly breeze that be-
gan to stir in the trees accelerated its
progress the rejoicing crowds in picca-
dilly fell silent as they began to breathe
the horrible contagion what new terror
was this

in park lane the dense throng pouring
north and south paused to sniff the breeze
where was this odor coming from-had
something gone wrong with the sewers or
was it coming from above as they stood
gazing upward they were startled by a
succession of crashes a shower of tiles
and roofing material began to fall from
the huge soaring clock of mondaine man-
sions the biggest building of its kind in
london the cries of the injured started
a panic-people surged this way and that
in an endeavor of escape from some new
unseen danger the weak were trampled
underfoot and the strong if they stum-
bled were lost

it took the police and the military sev-


weird tales

eral hours to clear park lane and the
vicinity the crowds were sternly admon-
ished to go home the injured were col-
lected and dispatched to the hospitals a
little group of officials stood in the at last
empty roadway looking at the pile of
debris which had fallen on the crowd

  heavens what on earth is that
stink exclaimed chief inspector salis-
bury to another officer

  its the decaying corpses of those
things at chingford they say replied his
friend hillo hillo

  the exclamation was caused by the de-
scent of another small shower of broken
tiles from the top of the building

  seems as if the damn thing is crum-
bling said the chief inspector well
have to close the road except for people
coming to the mansions-we can make
them use the back entrance

  yes but theres a dance going on in
there said his friend my god whats
all this

  through the main entrance of the build-
ing there came pouring a struggling terri-
fied mob of men and women in evening
dress some shouted frantically for their
cars and taxi-cabs others started running
on foot some surged round the police of-
ficers imploring help and protection it
took them some time to disentangle any-
thing coherent from the babble of voices
around them

  at last a little disheveled man in pa-
jamas with an overcoat thrown over them
disengaged himself from the crowd and
told his story

  he was a servant employed in the man-
sions who was off duty that night and had
retired to bed about eleven oclock he
had been awakened some time later by a
curious scraping scratching sound that
seemed to come from the roof overhead-
his bedroom was on the attic floor of the
building he kept on hearing the sound

and then dozing off and hearing it again
then when it seemed to be getting nearer
and louder-like a big rat gnawing he
said-he had switched on the light and
sat up in bed as he did so a shower of
plaster fell on his head and he looked up

  there was a hole in the ceiling above
his head and looking down at him was a
horny evil-looking head with a pair of
great jaws which were eating away the
lath and plaster of tfie ceiling as though it
were paper

  at first the little man had sat staring at
the thing hypnotized by the horror of it
and wondering whether he was in a night-
mare then he had a flash of comprehen-
sion-he had been reading the evening
papers and studying the photographs of
the monsters of epping forest this was
undoubtedly the same sort of creature on a
smaller scale he leaped out of bed threw
on an overcoat and raced for his life
shouting an alarm as he ran an aston-
ished liftman had refused to admit him
to his lift till the little man shaking the
steel bars of the door in a frenzy had man-
aged to convey to him what he had seen
the lift shot down to the ground floor and
the man ran along the corridors and found
himself at the entrance to the ballroom
dashing through the protesting attend-
ants he reached the middle of the floor
and shouted

  theyre here-the caterpillars are here
-in this house-theyre eating the roof
off i tell you ive seen them

  as the sound of his voice reached the
ears of the astonished dancers and his
meaning began to penetrate their minds
the couples one by one came to a standstill
and began to crowd round him the band
stopped playing and stood up to listen
angry managers and waiters who pushed
forward and tried to drag him away were
stopped by the guests who insisted on
hearing his story every mind was full of
moth



the press accounts of the horrors from
which london had been saved that after-
noon-and here was a terrified man pro-
claiming that the monsters were not only
in london but in that very building some
scoffed but the earnestness of the fright-
ened man was convincing in vain did the
managers try to laugh the thing down the
gathering was a fashionable one and sev-
eral of the men present insisted authorita-
tively on going up and testing the truth of
the story for themselves

  when they had left the ballroom the
guests stood about uneasily the timid edg-
ing toward the door the band attempted
to resume its functions but was angrily
shouted down by the people who wanted
to discuss this strange report and to cross-
examine the shivering little man in pa-
jamas the longer they waited the more
a feeling of panic grew there were noisy
shouts for champagne and whisky which
were served by pale and trembling wait-
ers the legend of the forest monsters
had by this time grown to a story of man-
devouring dragons clad in impenetrable
armor from whom there could be no
escape

when the men who had gone up in
the lift to inspect the mans room
returned to the ballroom one glance at
their set grave faces was enough to set a
rush for the exits in motion their spokes-
man in a loud voice implored every one to
keep calm but thought it would be best if
they all went home at once this precipi-
tated the rush of the panic-strcken guests
who had poured out into park lane and
surrounded the police officers

  the first care of these officers was to get
every one out of the building a cordon
was then drawn round it to prevent in-
jury to passengers from the occasional
showers of debris that continued to fall
and the officers having informed the au-

thorities of what had happened went up
to examine the place for themselves

  guided by the manager they reached
the vast expanse of flat concrete broken
here and there by tiled ridges and high
chimneys with the aid of powerful lamps
they examined every part of the place
without result till they came to a long
ridge roof that ran across the frontage to
park lane

  a strange sight met their eyes the til-
ing was mostly eaten away leaving some
of the rafters that had supported it bare
and skeleton-like against the sky rows of
huge caterpillars were at work on it sys-
tematically demolishing everything but
their own foothold a huge gap yawned
into the interior of the building and the
darkness of it was populated with dimly
seen moving forms

  theyre here all right said the chief
inspector wiping his forehead and how
are we going to deal with them here eh
luckily theyre comparatively small
said the manager nothing like the for-
est ones if the accounts are true

  yes said the inspector who knew
something about the subject but how
big do you suppose theyll be when theyve
eaten this building

  nonsense was the reply men with
axes could get rid of these easily enough
it seems to me

  their axes wouldnt make a scratch on
the skins of these things was the reply
wed better get down and shut the place
up till the war office makes up its mind
what to do

  the war office was not unduly con-
cerned it had dealt with the first menace
and it could deal with this it felt it con-
tented itself with posting a regiment in
and round the block and waited till day-
light should reveal the nature of the situa-
tion more clearly nevertheless it was a
complicated problem that it laid before


weird tales

the prime minister and his cabinet in the
morning

  the huge building was rapidly being
eaten away the two upper stories were
simply skeletons of girders from which all
the friable material had been consumed
but it was out of the question to use artil-
lery in the heart of london and bombing
by hand would involve much danger to
life and destruction to a building that rep-
resented a capital value of many millions
the shareholders and directors were
clamoring to have their property saved
from a kind of destruction against which
they were not insured the press and pub-
lic were demanding the most drastic meas-
ures to remove the menace to life and
property and the brood of monsters was
growing rapidly their length today was
estimated at ten feet what it might be in
a week no one liked to guess there
were a thousand suggestions none of
them useful the air force could not bomb
the place without destroying the whole
area poison gas was out of the question
the local authorities took one view the
county council another parliament was
not sitting a day passed and no conclu-
sion was reached a panic spread through
london and the roads were crowded in all
directions with cars bearing people away
to the safety of the country

  meantime the monsters kept within
the building eating systematically down-
ward brick wood furnishings all
seemed grist to their digestive mill the
braver inhabitants of london assembled in
the park in huge crowds to watch the
extraordinary spectacle of the huge block
of flats being slowly reduced to a skeleton
steel framework-for steel was the only
material that seemed to refuse to yield to
the action of those formidable jaws

it was on the third day while the au-
thorities were still disputing as to
methods and who was to bear the cost of

operations which might lead to wholesale
destruction of property that driven by
some instinctive purpose the brood broke
out of mondaine mansions now mostly
reduced to a steel skeleton without
warning they appeared suddenly on the
exterior walls and swung themselves down
on to the roadways that surrounded the
building one body of about fifty crossed
park lane and stepping over the railings
took possession of hyde park other
smaller detachments wandered into may-
fair some debouched on piccadilly and
crossed into the green park the crea-
tures now about twenty feet long moved
with such extreme rapidity that they had
scattered before any effective measures
could be devised to restrain them

  piccadilly was thronged with traffic
when without warning save for a few
shouts of terror from madly running peo-
ple three of the monsters came looping
down berkeley street and turned up
toward the circus the effect was terrible
traffic instantly came to a standstill and
people leaped from cars and omnibuses to
join in a wild flight to the safety of the
shops and clubs the street became one
solid mass of abandoned vehicles over
which the great caterpillars walked crush-
ing all but the strongest vehicles with their
weight and occasionally pausing to lash
their great bodies to and fro as they were
irritated by the fumes and noise of the
hundreds of engines left running by their
owners in the stampede many unfortu-
nates who had remained in their cars were
trampled by the formidable legs and
claspers that descended on them one
caterpillar sought to escape from its unac-
customed surroundings by taking a foot-
hold on a building stretching out to its
full length it fixed its forelegs on a bal-
cony and was lifting itself up when the
balcony gave way and crashed to the
pavement with the creature still clinging
moth



to it for a moment it lay writhing smash-
ing windows and wrecking cars with the
convulsive movements of its enormously
strong muscles then it got on its feet and
followed the others toward the circus

  here timely warning had enabled the
police to clear the road of all vehicles sol-
diers and police were drawn across all the
thoroughfares opening on the circus and
they immediately closed across the top of
piccadilly when the three creatures
emerged on to the empty space of the
circus how they were to stop the prog-
ress of the caterpillars they did not know
rifles were useless and dangerous and
bombing was also dangerous in the con-
fined space with every window crowded
and every shop and restaurant packed with
fugitives but fortunately the creatures
themselves solved the problem for a time
by coming to rest one stood with head
and tail on the ground and its body in a
loop and the others stretched their long
bodies flat on the roadway

a group of distracted men sat in the
cabinet room at no  downing
street air and military experts were urg-
ing their plans upon the members of the
government but all of them were so
fraught with danger to life and property
that to put them into operation at the mo-
ment was beyond the courage of the men
in control the gathering was actually dis-
cussing the evacuation of the capital in
order to give the soldiers and airmen a
free hand when it was interrupted by the
entry of a secretary who said that two
gentlemen were outside demanding an
interview with such urgency that he had
thought it right to announce their pres-
ence

  they say they are colonel butler and
air commodore langton retired said
the secretary and theyve got a string of
lorries out in whitehall the police tell
me

  butler and langton-bring them in at
once said the prime minister his face
lightening these are the two men whose
warnings and advice we have disregarded
all along you gentlemen at the air minis-
try he added bitterly drove langton
out of the service and wanted to certify
him for discovering this menace-butler
was the only man who had courage enough
to support him they may be able to save
us yet

  there was an uncomfortable silence
among the experts till the two friends
entered the room they presented a
strange appearance tired and worn as
men who had not known sleep for a long
time their clothes were crushed and un-
tidy and both were spotted from head to
foot with splashes of what looked like
whitewash

  sir said the colonel without preface
we want an order placing us in command
of the fire brigade at once langton has
thought of a method of destroying these
creatures-we have been engaged in pre-
paring our material for some days-we
need the fire engines

  murmurs arose immediately and de-
mands for an explanation from the assem-
bled experts but the colonel waved them
aside with an authoritative gesture

  the prime minister knows what it has
cost to put us under the control of experts
already he snapped with the anger of a
man near breaking-point our plan is
based upon a knowledge of entomology-
so was langtons first report that would
have sent him to an asylum if the authori-
ties had had their way briefly sir give
me a dozen fire engines with their crews
and well dispose of those creatures in
piccadilly circus as a first step

  without a word to his colleagues the
prime minister wrote out an order rapidly
and handed it to the colonel

  take it in gods name he exclaimed
 

weird tales

and make your attempt-if it fails we
shant be any the worse off

twenty minutes later the tense silence
which reigned in piccadilly circus was
broken by the familiar sound of fire-
engine bells the cordons were open and
six fire engines drove into the empty cir-
cus langton and the colonel on the first
behind them came a procession of petrol
lorries the tanks of which were plenti-
fully besmeared with white these were
drawn up behind the fire engines and the
hoses were attached to the tanks

under the directions of langton and
the colonel the firemen brought two
hoses as near as was safe to each of the
resting caterpillars

aim first at their sides were the
colonels final words to the men you
see those spots along each side-your ob-
ject is to hit these and keep hitting them
they are the breathing-spiracles of the
caterpillar-if they are choked he dies if
you cant keep on these work on their
heads where their sense organs are and
particularly their mouths

langton himself took the first hose at
a word from the colonel the pumping
began and six streams of white thickish
liquid began to play on the creatures at
first they disregarded the attack then they
expressed annoyance by twitching and
moving their bodies

give them a rest ordered the colo-
nel the spraying ceased and the creatures
settled down again but in a few moments
they began to show evidences of discom-
fort the intense heat of the midday sun
served to harden the mixture that had
been poured upon them they began to
twitch uneasily

at a signal from the colonel the
streams of white liquid were renewed the
creatures began to thrash about and then
to move in great loops but the moment

they tried to get into motion they were
caught by a blinding spray of the white
fluid full in the face clouds of spray de-
scended on the firemen and the soldiers
the roadway was as white as if it had been
whitewashed and in the middle of the
circus the three creatures turned this way
and that trying to escape from their tor-
mentors they lashed about in fury but at
every turn they were met by a torrent of
the fluid and in time it became evident
that their movements were becoming
sluggish one reared itself to its full height
as if in agony and fell slowly like a tree
collapsing under the pressure of a gale it
lay making convulsive movements but did
not rise the soldiers closed on it pick-
axes and sledgehammers laid to the head
and thorax finished what the firemen had
begun presently its companions shared
its fate in half an hour from the begin-
ning of the attack the three were dead

  an immense sigh of relief went up
from the crowd the firemen and the men
of the army and police they broke into
wild cheering while the colonel and
langton stood wiping the stuff from their
faces they were tired out but happy
they had demonstrated that it was possible
to overcome this menace to the country
without danger to the lives or properties
of the people

  the colonel grasped langtons hand
and wrung it warmly

  that was a damned ingenious idea of
yours my boy he exclaimed

  only a chance thought suggested by
that fool at wintram hall said langton
modestly

  but what is the idea asked a voice
at his side they swung round to find
themselves surrounded by the group they
had left at downing street and it was the
prime minister who had asked the ques-
tion amongst them was the eminent
moth



biologist who had been so heavily sarcastic
at wintram hall about the egg which he
had been called in to examine at him
langton cast a look of malice before
replying

  simple enough sir he said and
your biological expert who suggested that
the egg was a plaster of paris imitation
made by us will be interested to hear that
what we have been spraying on these crea-
tures is to quote his own words a mate-
rial obtained by calcining gypsum until it
has become partially dehyrated added in
certain quantities to water

  you mean plaster of paris

  nothing else sprayed into the breath-
ing-tubes of these creatures it hardens and
chokes them it also chokes up their jaws
and mouths and gets into the joints of
their forelegs it hardens on the outer
skin and impedes their movements-if
you can keep the application of it up long
enough it is bound to overcome them

  well whatever it is you have saved
london and perhaps the whole country
gentlemen said the prime minister
who was deeply moved i can tell you
that the country will not forget your serv-
ices in this crisis or how you have both
suffered for them

  langton and his friend blushed under
their coating of plaster and looked un-
comfortable

  you mustnt forget that there are
about a hundred of these things loose in
london sir said the colonel if some
of these military gentlemen will take over
the idea from us well be glad-it took
us three days and nights to assemble a
sufficient supply of this stuff and were
both tired out all i want from the coun-
try sir is permission to go home and
sleep

that was virtually the end of the
menace the method of destroying
them had been found and under military
control a vigorous campaign against the
invaders was established by twos and
threes or in solitary combat against a force
that nature had not given them a defense
for they were brought down in the streets
or in the parks till the last of them had
been exterminated

  how or why the parents of these broods
had reached england or where they came
from was never explained any better than
by the colonels theories no repetition
of the danger has ever taken place or
seems likely to probably only some chance
concatenation of circumstances brought
about their descent from regions unknown
to man the last scene of all took place
in trafalgar square where the solitary
survivor of the brood that had threatened
the existence of london was finally cor-
nered

  it was an immense creature over thirty
feet in length hemmed in by its enemies
and plastered with the deadly spray that
was rapidly choking its life out of it the
monster caught hold of the shaft of the
nelson monument and swung itself up-
ward till its hind claspers were grasping
the top of the column there it extended
its full length toward the fathomless blue
of the summer sky as if imploring succor
from the regions perhaps in the moon
perhaps on some far planet that were
native to it and its kind but none came
for a moment it swayed to and fro and
then fell with a crash to finish its death
agonies on the stone pavement of the
square and the creatures fashioned by
nature in another mold of another con-
sciousness and divided from it by gulfs of
impassable difference but sharing the
same principle of life shouted and cheered
exultantly as it stiffened into death
the venus of azombeii

by clark ashton smith

a fascinating weird story of an african amazon and an agonizing poison
that shrivels its victims before it slays them

the statuette was not more than
twelve inches in height and repre-
sented a female figure that some-
how reminded me of the medicean venus
despite many differences of feature and
proportion it was wrought of a black
wood almost as heavy as marble and the
unknown artist had certainly made the
most of his material to suggest the admix-
ture of a negroid strain with a type of
beauty well-nigh classic in its perfection
of line it stood on a pedestal formed in
imitation of a half-moon with the cloven
side of the hemisphere constituting the
base on studying it more closely i found
that the resemblance to the venus de
medici was largely in the pose and in the
curves of the hips and shoulders but the
right hand was more elevated than hers
in its position and seemed to caress the
polished abdomen and the face was
fuller with a smile of enigmatic voluptu-
ousness about the heavy lips and a sensu-
ous droop to the deep eyelids which were
like the petals of some exotic flower when
they fold beneath a sultry velvet evening
the workmanship was quite amazing
and would not have been unworthy of
the more archaic and primitive periods
of roman art

   my friend marsden had brought the
figurine with him on his return from
africa and it stood always on his library
table it had fascinated me and had stirred
my curiosity from the first but marsden
was singularly reticent concerning it and
beyond telling me that it was of negro
workmanship and represented the goddess
of a little-known tribe on the upper


benuwe in adamawa he had so far de-
clined to gratify my inquisitiveness but
his very reserve and something of signif-
icant import even of emotional perturba-
tion in his tone whenever we spoke of the
statuette had made me believe that a
story hung thereon and knowing mars-
den as i did remembering his habitual
reticence recurrently varied by outbursts
of a well-nigh garrulous confidentiality

i felt sure that he would tell me the story
in due time

  i had known marsden ever since our
school-days for we had both been in the
same year at berkeley he possessed few
friends and none perhaps who had been
intimate with him as long as i so no one
was better fitted than i to perceive the in-
explicable change that had come over him
since his two years of traveling in africa
this change was both physical and spir-
itual and some of its features were of so
subtle a character that one could hardly
give them a name or seize upon them with
any degree of clearness others though

 were all too plainly marked the increase
of marsdens natural melancholia turn-
ing now into fits of ferocious depression
and the woful deterioration in his health
never too robust even in its prime would
have been noticeable to the merest ac-
quaintance i remembered him as being
very tall and wiry with a sallow com-
plexion black hair and eyes of a clear
azure blue but since his return he was
far thinner than of old and he stooped
so much that he gave the impression of
having actually lost in height his features
were shrunken and wrinkled his skin had
w t-
the venus of azombeii

 

become corpse-like in its pallor his hair
was heavily sprinkled with gray and his
eyes had darkened in an unaccountable
manner as if they had somehow absorbed
the mysteriously profound and sinister
blue of tropic nights in them there
burned a fire that they had never before

possessed-a macabre fire such as one
would find in the eyes of a man consumed
by some equatorial fever indeed it often
occurred to me that the readiest explana-
tion of the change in marsden was that
he had been seized by some lethal sick-
ness of the jungle from which he had not


weird tales

yet fully recovered but this he had always
denied when i questioned him

the more elusive alterations at which i
have hinted were mainly mental and i
shall not try to define all of them but
one in particular was quite signal mars-
den had always been a man of undoubted
courage and hardihood with nerves that
were unshakable in spite of his melan-
cholic disposition but now i perceived in
him at times a queer furtiveness an un-
definable apprehensiveness quite at vari-
ance with his former character even in
the midst of some trivial or commonplace
conversation a look of manifest fear
would suddenly pass over his face he
would scrutinize the shadows of the room
with an apprehensive stare and would
stop half-way in a sentence apparently
forgetting what he had started to say
then in a few moments he would re-
cover himself and go on with the inter-
rupted speech  he had developed some
odd mannerisms too one of them was
that he could never enter or leave a room
without looking behind him with the air
of a man who fears that he is being fol-
lowed or that some imminent doom is
dogging his every footstep but all this
of course could have been explained as
nervousness attendant upon or resulting
from the illness that i suspected mars-
den himself would never discuss the mat-
ter so after a few discreet suggestions
that might have led him to unbosom him-
self if he so wished i had tacitly ignored
the visible changes in his manner and per-
sonality but i sensed a real and perhaps
tragic mystery and felt also that the black
figurine on marsders table was in some
way connected with it he had told me
much concerning his trip to africa which
had been undertaken because of a life-
long fascination which that continent had
held for him but i knew intuitively that
much more was being kept back

one morning about six weeks after
marsdens return i called to see him
following several days of absence during
which i had been extremely busy he was
living alone with one servant in the large
house on russian hill san francisco
which he had inherited together with a
considerable fortune from his parents
who were long dead he did not come to
answer my knock as was his wont and
if my hearing were not exceptionally keen

i do not think i should have heard the
feeble voice in which he called out tell-
ing me to enter pushing open the door
i went through the hall into the library
from which his voice had issued and
found him lying on a sofa near the table
on which stood the black statuette it was
obvious to me at a glance that he was very
ill his thinness and pallor had increased
to a shocking degree in the few days since
i had seen him last and i was immedi-
ately impressed by the singular fact that
he had even shrunken more in stature than
could be explained by the crouch of his
shoulders everything about him had
shriveled had actually withered as if a
flame were consuming him and the form
on the couch was that of a smaller man
than my friend he had aged also and
his hair had taken on a new hoariness as
if white ashes had fallen upon it his
eyes were pitifully sunken and they
burned as embers burn in deep caverns i
could scarcely repress a cry of astonish-
ment and consternation when i saw him

  well holly he greeted me i guess
my days are numbered i knew the thing
would get me in time-i knew it when i
left the shores of the benuwe with that
image of the goddess wanaos for a keep-
sake    there are dreadful things in
africa holly-malignant lust and cor-
ruption and poison and sorcery-things
that are deadlier than death itself-at
least deadlier than death in any form that
we know dont ever go there-if you
the venus of azombeii



have any care for the safety of body and
soul

  i tried to reassure him without paying
ostensible heed to the more cryptic refer-
ences the more oracular hints in his utter-
ance

  there is some low african fever in
your system i said you should see a
doctor-should in faa have seen one
weeks or months ago theres no reason
why you shouldnt get rid of the trouble
whatever it is now that you are back in
america but of course you need expert
medical attention you cant afford to
neglea anything so insidious and ob-
scure

  marsden smiled-if the ghastly con-
tortion of his lips could be called a smile
its no use old man i know my malady
better than any doctor could know it of
course it may be that i have a little fever
-that wouldnt be surprizing but the
fever isnt one that has ever been classi-
fier in medical lore and theres no cure
for it in any pharmacopoeia

  with the last word his countenance
assumed a horrible grimace of pain and
seemed to shrivel before me like a sheet
of paper that turns ashen with fire he
no longer appeared to notice my presence
and began to mutter brokenly in tones
of a peculiar huskiness in a harsh grat-
ing whisper as if the very cords of his
throat were involved in the same shrink-
ing that affected his face i caught most
if not all of the words

  she is dying too-as i am-even
though she is a living goddess    my-
baloe why did you drink the palm-wine
   you too will shrivel up and suffer
these gnawing clawing tortures   your
beautiful body    how perfea how
magnificent it was    you will shrivel
up in a few weeks like a little old woman
   you will suffer the torments of hell-
fire    mybaloe mybaloe   

  his speech became an indistina moan-
ing in which portions of words were now
and then audible he had all the aspea
of a dying man his whole body seemed
to contract as if all the muscles all the
nerves even the very bones were dwin-
dling in size were tightening to a locked
rigidity and his lips were drawn in a
horrible rictus showing a thin white line
of teeth

  i ran to marsdens dining-room where
i knew that a decanter full of old scotch
usually stood on the sideboard and filled
a sherry-glass with the liquor hastening
back i succeeded though with extreme
difficulty in forcing some of the strong
spirit between his teeth the effect was
almost immediate he revived into full
consciousness his facial muscles relaxed
and he no longer wore the look of tetanic
agony that had possessed his whole body

  im sorry to have been such a bother
he said but the crisis is past for today
   tomorrow though    thatll be
another matter he shuddered and his
eyes were dark with the haunting of some
incombatable horror

  i made him drink the remainder of the
whisky and going to the telephone took
the liberty of summoning a doaor whose
abilities were personally known to both
of us my friend smiled a little in grate-
ful recognition of my solicitude but
shook his head

  the end wont be so very far off
now he said i know the symptoms
its a matter of a fortnight or little more
when matters reach the point that they
have reached today

  but what is it i cried the query
was prompted by horror and solicitude
more than curiosity

  you will learn soon enough he re-
plied pointing to the library table with
a forefinger of skeleton thinness do
you see that manuscript


weird tales

  following his direction i perceived on
the table close to the wooden statuette a
pile of written sheets which in my
natural concern regarding marsdens ill-
ness i had not before noticed

  you are my oldest friend he went
on and i have been aware for quite a
while past that i owe you an explanation
of certain things that have puzzled you
but the matters involved are so strange
and so peculiarly intimate that i have
been unable to bring myself to a frank
confession face to face so i have written
for you a full narration of the final two
months of my stay in africa concerning
which i have spoken so little heretofore
you are to fake it home with you when
you leave but i must beg you not to read
the manuscript till after my death i am
sure i can trust you to respect my wishes
in this regard when you read it you
ridll learn the cause of my illness and
the story of the black figurine which has
tantalized your curiosity so much

  a few minutes later there came a
knock on the door and i went to answer
it as i expected it was dr felton who
lived only a few blocks away and who
had left home immediately in reply to my
summons he was a brisk and confident
type of person with the air of habitual
reassurance of professional good cheer
that goes so far in building up a doctors
reputation for proficiency but i could see
beneath his manner an undertone of
doubt of real bafflement as he examined
marsden

  im not altogether sure what is
wrong he admitted but i think the
trouble is mainly digestive and nervous
doubtless the african climate and the
food must have upset you quite radically
you will need a nurse if there is any
recurrence of the attack you have had
today

  he wrote a prescription and left short-

ly after since i had a pressing engage-
ment i was obliged to follow him in
about half an hour taking with me the
manuscript that marsden had indicated
but before going i called a nurse by
telephone with marsdens authority and
left her in charge promising to return as
soon as possible

of the fortnight that followed with
the frightful protracted agonies the
brief and illusory shifts for the better
the ghastly relapses that characterized my
friends condition i can not bear to write
a full account i spent with him all the
time i could spare for my presence
seemed to comfort him a little except
during the awful daily crises when he
was beyond all consciousness of his sur-
roundings toward the last there were
lengthening intervals of delirium when
he muttered wildly or screamed aloud in
terror of things or persons visible only to
himself to be with him to watch him
was an ordeal without parallel and to
me the most dreadful thing about it all
was the progressive shriveling the per-
petual diminution of marsdens head and
body and the lessening of his very stat-
ure which went on hour by hour and day
by day with paroxysmal accompaniments
of a suffering not to be borne by human
flesh without lapsing into madness or
oblivion    but i can not enter into
details or describe the final stages and i
hardly dare even hint the condition in
which he died and in which his body
went to the undertaker i can only say
that in their extreme their more than
infantile dwarfage and devolution of
form the remains bore no likeness to
anything that it would be permissible to
name also that the task of the under-
taker and the pall-bearers was phenome-
nally light    when the end came i
gave thanks to god for the belated mercy
the venus of azombeii



of my friends death i was completely
worn out and it was not until after the
funeral that i summoned enough energy
and resolution for a perusal of marsdens
manuscript

  the account was clearly written in a
fine feline script though the handwrit-
ing bore evidence of stress and agitation
toward the end i transcribe the narrative
hereunder with no liberties of abridg-
ment or amplification

i julius marsden have experienced
j all my life the ineffable nostalgia of
the far-off and the unknown i have loved
the very names of remote places of antip-
odean seas and continents and isles but
i have never found in any other word
even a tithe of the untellable charm that
has lain inherent for me ever since child-
hood in the three syllables of the word
africa they have conjured up for me
as by some necromantic spell the very
quintessence of all mystery of all
romance and no womans name could
have been dearer to me or more eloquent
of delight and allure than the name of
this obscure continent by a happy dis-
pensation which alas does not invariably
attend the fulfilment of our dreams my
twenty-two months of sojourning in
morocco tunis egypt zanzibar sene-
gal dahomey and nigeria had in no way
disappointed me for the reality was
astoundingly like my vision in the hot
and heavy azure of the skies the great
levels of desert sand or of rampant jun-
gles the long and mighty rivers winding
through landscapes of unbelievable
diversity i found something that was
deeply congenial to my spirit it was a
realm in which my rarest dreams could
dwell and expand with a sense of free-
dom never achievable elsewhere

  at the end of the twenty-second month
of my sojourn i was traveling on the

upper reaches of the river benuwe that
great eastern tributary of the niger my
immediate objective was lake tchad
with whose confluent rivers the benuwe
is connected by means of an upland
swamp i had left yollah with several
boatmen of the foulah tribe a race of
negroid mohammedans and we had now
rounded the eastern slope of mount al-
antika that enormous granite bulk that
looms for nine thousand feet from the
fertile plains of adamawa

  it was a picturesque and beautiful
country through which we were passing
there were occasional villages surround-
ed by fields of durra of cotton and yams
and great stretches of wild luxuriant
forest of baobabs bananas deleb-palms
pandanus and plaintains beyond which
arose the castellated tops of ridgy hills
and fantastically carven cliffs

  toward sunset alantika had become
a bluish blur in the distance above the
green sea of the jungle as we went
onward in our two small barges one of
which was mainly laden with my per-
sonal effects i perceived that my boat-
men were conversing among themselves
in low voices and caught a frequent
repetition of the word azombeii
always with a note of fear and warning

  i had already picked up a little of the
foulah language and one of the boat-
men a tall well-featured fellow bronze
rather than black was master of a sort of
broken german variegated with a few
words of english i questioned him as to
the subject and import of the conversa-
tion and learned that azombeii was the
name of the district we were now ap-
proaching which he declared was peo-
pled by a pagan tribe of unusual ferocity
who were still suspected of cannibalism
and human sacrifice they had never
been properly subdued either by the
mohammedan conquerors of the country


weird tales

or by the present german administration
and lived very much to themselves in
their own primeval way worshipping a
goddess named wanaos-a goddess un-
familiar even to the other pagan tribes of
adamawa who were all fetishists they
were especially inimical toward the
mohammedan negroes and it was peril-
ous to intrude upon their territory par-
ticularly during the annual religious
festival now being celebrated he and
his fellows he confessed were loth to
proceed much farther

  on all this at the time i made no
express comment to me the story
seemed none too credible and savored of
the ignorant prejudice of insular peo-
ples who are ever suspicious and fearful
of those beyond their own borders but
i was a little disturbed for i did not
want the course of my journey to be sus-
pended by any difficulty with my boat-
men or the natives

  the sun had now gone down with a
tropical abruptness and in the brief twi-
light i saw that the forest on the river-
banks had become more dense and
exuberant than any through which we
had before passed there were ancient
baobabs enormous in the gloom and the
pendant leaves of mammoth plants fell
down to the river like cataracts of em-
erald over all a primordial silence
reigned-a silence fraught with the bur-
den of things unutterable by human
speech-with the furtive pulse of an
esoteric and exotic life the secret breath-
ing of unformulable passion of unap-
prehended peril the spirit of a vast and
insuppressible fecundity

we landed on a grassy margin and
proceeded to make our camp for
the night after a meal of yams and
ground-nuts and tinned meat to which i
added a little palm-wine i brought up

the matter of continuing our journey on
the morrow but not until i had pledged
myself to triple the boatmens wages
would they promise to take me through
the azombeii country i was more than
ever inclined to make light of their fears
and in faa had begun to suspea that
the whole business was mere play-aaing
with no other purpose than the extortion
of an increase of pay but this of course
i could not prove and the boatmen were
full of an apparent reluaance vowing by
allah and his prophet mohammed that
the danger they would incur was incom-
parably dire-that they and even my-
self might furnish soup-meat for the
revels of azombeii or smoke on a pagan
altar before the setting of tomorrows
sun they also told me some curious
details concerning the customs and beliefs
of the people of azombeii these people
they said were ruled by a woman who
was looked upon as the living representa-
tive of the goddess wanaos and who
shared the divine honors accorded to her
wanaos as far as i could gather ap-
peared to be a goddess of love and pro-
creation resembling somewhat in her
character both the roman venus and the
carthaginian tanit i was struck even
then by a certain etymological similarity
of her name to that of venus-a similar-
ity regarding which i was soon to learn
more she was worshipped they told me
with rites and ceremonies of an orgiastic
license beyond all parallel-a license
which shocked even the neighboring
pagans who were themselves given to
vile praaises not to be tolerated by any
virtuous moslem they went on to say
that the azombeiians were also addiaed
to sorcery and that their witch-doaors
were feared throughout adamawa

  my curiosity was aroused though i
told myself that in all probability the
rumors related by the boatmen were
the venus of azombeii



fables or gross exaggerations but i had
seen something of negro religious rites
and was able to credit the tales of orgias-
tic excess at any rate pondering the
strange stories i had heard my imagina-
tion became excited and i did not fall
asleep till after an unwonted interval

  my slumber was heavy and full of
troubled dreams that appeared to prolong
intolerably the duration of the night i
awoke a little before dawn when the red
horn of a waning moon had begun to
set behind the serrate edges of palm-
trees in the west looking about in the
half-light with eyes that were still
bemused with sleep i found myself en-
tirely alone the boatmen and their
barges were gone though all of my per-
sonal property and some of the provisions
had been left behind with an honesty
quite scrupulous considering the circum-
stances evidently the fears expressed by
the foulahs had been genuine and dis-
cretion had overpowered their desire for
gain

  somewhat dismayed by the prospect
of having to continue my journey alone-
if it were to be continued at all-and
without means of navigation or convey-
ance i stood irresolute on the river-bank
as the dawn began to brighten i did not
like the idea of turning back and since
i did not consider it at all probable that
i could be in any bodily danger at the
hands of the natives in a region under
german rule i finally resolved to go on
and try to engage bearers or boatmen in
the azombeii district it would be neces-
sary for me to leave most of my effects
by the river for the present and return
for them later trusting to find them un-
disturbed

  i had no sooner made up my mind to
this course of procedure than i heard a
soft rustling in the long grasses behind
me turning i perceived that i was no

longer alone though my companions
were not the missing foulahs as i had
hoped for a brief instant two negro
women attired in little more than the
lightening amber air of morn stood close
beside me both were fairly tall and
well-proportioned but it was the fore-
most of the two who caught my attention
with a veritable shock of surprize not
altogether due to the suddenness of her
approach

her appearance would have surprized
me anywhere at any time her skin was
a lustrous velvet black with subtle
gleams of rapid-running bronze but all
her features and proportions by some
astounding anomaly were those of an
antique venus indeed i have seldom
seen in caucasian women a more con-
summate regularity of profile and facial
contour as she stood before me without
moving she might have been a woman
of rome or pompeii sculptured in black
marble by a statuary of the latin deca-
dence she wore a look that was both
demure and sensual an expression full
of cryptic poise allied with great sweet-
ness her hair was done in a rich coil on
the nape of a comely neck between her
breasts on a chain of beaten silver hung
several ruddy garnets carven with rough
intaglios whose precise nature i did not
notice at the time her eyes met mine
with perfect frankness and she smiled
with an air of naive delight and mis-
chief at my all-too-obvious dumfound-
ment that smile made me her voluntary
captive henceforward

the second woman was of a more
negroid type though personable enough
in her way by her bearing and de-
meanor she gave the impression of being
somehow subordinate to the first and i
assumed that she was a slave or servant
the one semblance of a garment worn by
both was a little square of cloth depend-


weird tales

ing in front from a girdle of palm-fiber
but the fabric of the square worn by the
first was finer than that of the other and
differed from it in having a fringe of
silky tassels

the leader turned and spoke a few
words to her companion in mellifluous
liquid tones and the servant replied in a
voice almost equally soft and musical
the word aroumani was repeated sev-
eral times with accompanying glances at
me and i readily surmised that i was
the theme of their conversation i could
not understand their speech which bore
no likeness to the foulah language and
indeed was different from that of any
pagan tribe i had so far encountered in
adamawa but some of the vocables
teased me with a vague sense of familiar-
ity though i could not define or aline
this familiarity at the moment

i addressed the two women in the
scant foulah that i knew asking if they
were of the azombeii tribe they smiled
and nodded their heads in recognition of
the word and made signs to me that i
was to follow them

the sun had now leapt above the hori-
zon and the forest was filled with a
green and golden radiance as the women
led me away from the river-shore and
along a meandering path among gigantic
baobabs they walked before me with a
grave and effortless grace and the leader
looked back every now and then over her
shapely shoulder smiling with a com-
plaisant curve of the full lips and a de-
licious droop of the carven lids that had
in them a trace of simple coquetry i fol-
lowed half overcome by emotions that
were new to me-by the first pulsations
of a mounting fever of the senses and the
mind the stirring of unfamiliar curiosi-
ties the subtle languor the poppy-drowsy
delight of a circean enchantment i felt

as if the immemorial attraction of africa
had suddenly become embodied for me
in a human shape

  the forest began to thin and we came
to cultivated fields and then to a large
village of clay huts my sable guides
pointed to the village saying the one
word azombeii which as i learned
later was the name of the principal town
as well as of the district in general

  the place was astir with negroes many
of whom both male and female were
possessed of a clear-cut type of feature
unaccountably reminiscent of the classical
and similar to that of the two women
their skins varied from darkest ebony to
a sultry tarnished copper many of them
crowded around us immediately regard-
ing me with a sort of friendly inquisitive-
ness and making signs of obeisance and
reverence before my venus-like compan-
ion it was clear that she occupied a
place of high importance among them
and i wondered not for the first time if
she were the woman of whom the fou-
lahs had spoken-the ruler of the azom-
beii and the living viceregent of the god-
dess wanaos

  i tried to converse with the natives but
could not make myself understood till an
old man with a bald head and a strag-
gling fringe of gray beard came forward
and hailed me in broken english he it
seemed had traveled as far afield as
nigeria during his youth which account-
ed for his linguistic accomplishments
none of the others had ever been more
than a few miles beyond the confines of
his own territory and apparently the
tribe had had little intercourse with out-
siders either negro or caucasian

  the old man was most affable and
loquacious evidently delighting in an
opportunity to air his command of a for-
eign tongue it was hardly necessary to
question him for he began at once to
the venus of azombeii



volunteer the information which i de-
sired his people he announced were
very glad to see me for they were friend-
ly toward the whites though they had no
manner of use for the moslem negroes
of adamawa also he went on it was
manifest that i had won the favor and
protection of the goddess wanaos since
i appeared among them under the guid-
ance of mybaloe their beloved ruler in
whom the spirit of the goddess resided
at this he made an humble obeisance
toward my lovely guide who smiled and
addressed a few sentences to him which
he forthwith interpreted saying that
mybaloe had proffered me an invitation
to remain in azombeii as her guest

  i had intended to broach immediately
the matter of hiring bearers or engaging
boatmen for the continuance of my jour-
ney on the benuwe but at this invitation
and the sweet wistful almost sup-
plicating look which mybaloe directed
upon me as her words were being trans-
lated i forgot all about my plans and
told the interpreter to thank mybaloe and
say that i accepted the invitation a few
hours earlier i should not have dreamt
of the possibility of feeling any specific
interest in a black woman since that
aspect of the charm of africa was one
which had never really touched me here-
tofore but now the first weavings of
an unforeseen magic were upon me my
senses had become preternaturally active
and my normal processes of thought were
benumbed as by the working of some in-
sidious opiate i had been eager to reach
lake tchad and the idea of tarrying by
the way had never before occurred to me
now it seemed the most natural thing in
the world to remain in azombeii and
lake tchad became a dimly receding
mirage far off on the borders of oblivion

  mybaloes face grew radiant as a sum-
mer morn when my acceptance was in-

terpreted she spoke to some of the peo-
ple about her obviously giving them in-
structions then she disappeared among
the crowd and the old interpreter with
several others led me to a hut which they
put at my disposal the hut was quite
clean and the floors were strewn with
strips of palm-leaf which exhaled an
agreeable odor food and wine were set
before me and the old man and two
girls remained in attendance saying that
they had been appointed as my servants
i had barely finished my meal when
some more natives entered bearing the
belongings i had left by the river-side

  now in reply to my queries the inter-
preter whose name was nygaza told me
as much as his rudimentary english
would convey regarding the history
habits and religion of the people of
azombeii according to their traditions
the worship of wanaos among them was
almost as old as the world itself and had
been introduced ages and ages ago by
some white strangers from the north who
called themselves aroumani these stran-
gers had settled and married among the
natives and their blood had gradually
become disseminated throughout the
whole tribe who had always remained
apart from the other pagans of adamawa
all white people were called aroumani
by them and were looked upon with
peculiar respect on account of these tra-
ditions wanaos as the foulahs had
said was a deity of love and fecundation
the mother of all life the mistress of the
world and her image had been accurate-
ly graven in wood by the pale strangers
so that the azombeiians might have an
exemplar for their idols it had always
been customary to associate a living
woman with her worship as a sort of
avatar or embodiment of the goddess and
the most beautiful maiden of the district
was chosen by the priests and priestesses


weird tales

for this role and filled also the office of
queen with the privilege of taking to
herself a male consort mybaloe a girl
of eighteen had recently been elected
and the annual festival of wanaos which
consisted of liberal drinking and feasting
together with nightly ceremonies of wor-
ship was now in progress

  while i listened to the old man i in-
dulged in certain speculations of a sur-
prizing order i deemed it not impos-
sible that the pale strangers of whom he
spoke had been a party of roman ex-
plorers who had crossed the sahara from
carthage and penetrated the sudan
this would account for the classic fea-
tures of mybaloe and others of the
azombeiians and for the name and
character of the local goddess also the
vague familiarity of some of the words
spoken by mybaloe was now explicable
since i realized that these words had
borne a partial resemblance to latin
vocables much amazed by what i had
learned and by all that i had succeeded
in piecing together i lost myself in odd
reveries while nygaza continued his
babbling

the day wore on and i did not see
mybaloe as i had fully expected
nor did i receive word from her i began
to wonder a little nygaza said that her
absence was attributable only to urgent
duties he leered discreetly as he assured
me that i would soon see her again

  i went for a walk through the village
accompanied by the interpreter and the
girls who refused to leave me for a mo-
ment the town as i have said was
large for an african village and must
have comprised two or three thousand
people all was neat and orderly and
the general degree of cleanliness was
quite remarkable the azombeiians i
could see were thrifty and industrious

and gave evidence of many civilized qual-
ities

  toward the hour of sunset a messen-
ger came bearing an invitation from
mybaloe which nygaza translated i was
to dine with her in her palace and then
attend the evening rites in the local
temple

  the palace stood on the very outskirts
of the town among palms and pandanus
and was merely an overgrown hut as
african palaces are wont to be but the
interior proved to be quite comfortable
even luxurious and a certain barbaric
taste had been displayed in its furnishing
there were low couches along the walls
covered with draperies of native weaving
or the skins of the ayu a sort of fresh-
water seal found in the benuwe in the
center was a long table not more than a
foot in height from the floor around
which the guests were squatted in one
corner as in a niche i noticed a small
wooden image of a female figure which
i rightly took to be a representation of
wanaos the figure bore a strange re-
semblance to the roman venus but i
need not describe it further since you
have often seen it on my library table

  mybaloe greeted me with many com-
pliments which were duly translated by
nygaza and i not to be outdone replied
with speeches of a flowery fervor by no
means insincere my hostess had me
seated at her right hand and the feast
began the guests i learned were most-
ly priests and priestesses of wanaos all
of them regarded me with friendly smiles
with the exception of one man who wore
a murderous frown this man nygaza
told me in a whisper almost inaudible
was the high-priest mergawe a mighty
sorcerer or witch-doctor much feared
rather than revered who had long been in
love with mybaloe and had hoped to be
chosen for her consort
the venus of azombeii



  as unobtrusively as i could i surveyed
mergawe with more attention he was a
muscular brute over six feet in height
and broad without being stout his face
was regular in outline and would have
been handsome were it not for the distor-
tion due to a most malignant expression
whenever mybaloe smiled upon me or
addressed some remark to me through
nygaza his look became a demoniacal
glare i readily perceived that the first day
of my visit in azombeii had brought me a
powerful enemy as well as a possible
sweetheart

  the table was laden with equatorial
delicacies with the meat of young
rhinoceros several kinds of wild fowl
bananas papayas and a sweet highly in-
toxicating palm-wine most of the guests
were prone to gorge themselves in true
african fashion but mybaloes manner of
eating was as dainty as that of any eu-
ropean girl and she endeared herself to
me all the more by her restraint mergawe
also ate little but drank immoderately in
a seeming attempt to achieve inebriation
as soon as possible the eating and drink-
ing went on for hours but i paid less and
less attention to it and to my fellow-
guests in the ever-growing enchantment
of mybaloes presence her sinuous youth-
ful grace of figure her lovely tender eyes
and lips were far more potent than the
wine and i soon forgot to notice even the
baleful glaring of mergawe on her part
mybaloe displayed toward me a frank
favor swiftly conceived and avowed
which she did not even dream of disguis-
ing she and i began to speak a language
which did not require the interpretation
of old nygaza with the one exception
of mergawe no one seemed to regard
our mutual infatuation with anything but
approval

  presently the time of the evening rites
approached and mybaloe excused herself

telling me that she would meet me later
in the temple the gathering broke up
and nygaza led me through the nocturnal
village where groups of people were
feasting and revelling about their fires in
the open air we entered the jungle
which was full of voices and flitting
shadowy forms all on their way to the
fane of wanaos i had no idea what the
temple would be like though somehow i
did not expea the usual african fetish-
house to my surprize it proved to be an
enormous cave in a hill back of the vil-
lage it was illumined by many torches
and had already become crowded with the
worshippers at the farther end of the htige
chamber whose lofty vault was dark with
impenetrable shadow there stood on a
sort of natural dais an image of wanaos
carved in the customary black wood of a
tree that is native to azombeii the image
was somewhat more than life-size beside
it on a wooden seat that could easily have
accommodated another person sat myba-
loe statuesque and immobile as the god-
dess herself fragrant leaves and grasses
were burning on a low altar and tom-
toms were throbbing with delirious insist-
ence regular as the beating of turgid
pulses in the gloom behind the goddess
and her mortal viceregent the priests
priestesses and devotees were all naked
except for little squares of cloth similar to
that worn-by mybaloe and their bodies
gleamed like polished metal in the wild-
ly flickering light of the torches all were
chanting a solemn monotonous litany
and they swayed in the slow movements
of a hieratic dance lifting their arms
toward wanaos as if to invoke her favor

  there was an undeniable impressive-
ness about it all and as if by contagion
a bizarre excitement began to invade me
and something of the sacred fervor felt
by the devotees found its way into my
own blood with eyes intent upon


weird tales

mybaloe who seemed to be in a veritable
trance unconscious or unheedful of all
about her i felt the resurgence of ata-
vistic impulses of barbaric passions and
superstitions latent in the subterranean
depths of being i knew the promptings
of a savage hysteria of a lust both ani-
mal and religious

the old interpreter who had disap-
peared in the throng returned to my side
anon saying that mybaloe had requested
that i come forward to her seat how
the request had been communicated i can
not imagine for surely her lips had never
opened or moved beneath my intent and
passionate watching the worshippers
made way for me and i stood before
her thrilling almost with a kind of awe
as well as a frenetic desire when i met
her eyes that were filled by the solemn
possession of the amorous deity she
motioned me to seat myself beside her
by this act as i learned later she selected
me before all the world as her consort
and i by accepting the invitation became
her official lover

now as if my enthronement with
mybaloe were a signal the ceremonies
took on a new excitation with an or-
giastic trend at which i can only hint
things were done at which tiberias
would have blushed elephantis itself
could have learned more than one secret
from these savages the cavern became
a scene of indiscriminate revel and the
goddess and her representative were alike
forgotten in the practise of rites that
were doubtless appropriate enough con-
sidering the nature of wanaos even
though they were highly improper from
a civilized viewpoint through it all
mybaloe maintained a perfect immobil-
ity with open eyes whose lids were still
as those of the statue at last she arose
and looked around the cavern upon her
oblivious devotees with a gaze that was

wholly inscrutable then she turned to
me with a demure smile and a slight
movement of the hand and beckoned me
to follow her unnoticed by any one we
left the orgies and came forth upon the
open jungle where warm gusts of per-
fume wandered beneath the tropical
stars   

from that night there began for me a
new life-a life which i will not try
to defend but will only describe as far
as any description is possible i had never
before conceived of anything of the sort
i should never have believed myself
capable of the sensuous fervor i felt for
mybaloe and the almost inenarrable ex-
periences into which her love initiated
me the dark electric vitality of the very
earth upon which i trod the humid
warmth of the atmosphere the life of the
swiftly grown luxuriant plants all became
an intimate part of my own entity were
mingled with the ebb and flow of my
blood and i drew nearer than ever before
to the secret of the charm that had lured
me across the world to that esoteric con-
tinent a powerful fever exalted all my
senses a deep indolence bedrugged my
brain i lived as never before and never
again to the full capacity of my corporeal
being i knew as an aborigine knows
the mystic impact of perfume and color
and savor and tactual sensation through
the flesh of mybaloe i touched the primal
reality of the physical world i had no
longer any thoughts or even dreams in
the abstract meaning of such terms but
existed wholly in relation to my surround-
ings to the diurnal flux of light and
darkness of sleep and passion and all
sensory impressions

  mybaloe i am sure was indeed lov-
able and her charm though highly
voluptuous was not altogether of the
body she had a fresh and naive nature
the venus of azombeii



laughter-loving and kindly with less of
actual or latent cruelty than is common
to the african and always i found in
her even apart from her form and fea-
tures a delightful suggestion of the elder
pagan world a hint of the classic woman
and the goddess of old myths her sor-
cery perhaps was not really complex but
its power was complete and lay as far
beyond analysis as beyond denial i
became the ecstatic slave of a loving and
indulgent queen

  the flowers of an equatorial spring
were now in bloom and our nights were
opiate or aphrodisiac with their fragrance
the nocturnal heavens were full of fervid
stars the noons were balmy and pro-
pitious and the people of azombeii
looked with favor upon our love since
the will of mybaloe was to them the will
of the goddess

  one cloud alone-a cloud which we
scarcely regarded at first-was visible in
our firmament this cloud was the jeal-
ousy and ill-will of mergawe the high-
priest of wanaos he glowered with a
lethal malignity sullen as a negro satan
whenever i happened to meet him but
his ill-will was not otherwise demon-
strated either by word or act and ny-
gaza and mybaloe both assured me that
overt hostility on his part would be most
improbable at any time since because
of mybaloes divine office and my posi-
tion as her lover anything of the sort
would savor of actual blasphemy

  as for me i felt an intuitive distrust of
the sorcerer though i was far too happy
to expend much thought on the problem
of his potential maleficence however
the man was an interesting type and his
reputation was literally something with
which to conjure people believed that he
knew the language of animals and could
even hold converse with trees and
stones which accorded him whatever in-

formation he might require he was
reputed to be a master of what is known
as bad fetish-that is to say he could
lay an evil spell on the person or posses-
sions of whosoever had incurred his
enmity he was a practitioner of in-
vultuation and was also said to know the
secret of a terrible slow poison which
caused its victims to wither up and shrivel
to the stature of a new-born child with
prolonged and hellish agonies-a poison
which did not begin to operate for weeks
or even months after the time of its con-
sumption

  the days went by and i lost all proper
count of their passage reckoning time
only by the hours i spent with mybaloe
the world and its fullness were ours-
ours were the deep-blue heavens and the
flowering forest and the grassy meadows
by the riverside as lovers are prone to
do we found for ourselves more than one
favorite haunt to which we liked to re-
pair at recurrent intervals one of these
haunts was a grotto behind the cave-
temple of wanaos in whose center was
a great pool fed by the river benuwe
through subterranean channels at some
remote time the roof of the grotto had
broken in leaving a palm-fringed aper-
ture in the hill-top dirough which the
sunlight or moonlight fell with precipi-
tate rays upon the somber waters around
the sides there were many broad ledges
and fantastic alcoves of columnar stone
it was a place of weird beauty and
mybaloe and i had spent more than one
moon-lit hour on the couch-like shelves
above the pool the waters were in-
habited by several crocodiles but of these
we took little heed absorbed in each
other and in the bizarre loveliness of the
grotto that always changed with the
changing light

  one day mybaloe had been sum-
moned away from the village on some


weird tales

errand whose nature i can not now re-
member doubtless it concerned some
problem of justice or native politics at
any rate she was not expected back till
the following noon therefore i was
quite surprized when a messenger came
to me at evening with word that mybaloe
would return sooner than she had
planned and that she requested me to
meet her in the grotto behind the cave
of wanaos at the hour when the rays of-
the moon now slightly gibbous would
first fall through the opening above the
native who brought the message was a
man i had never seen before but of this
i thought nothing since he purported to
come from the outlying village to which
mybaloe had been called

 reached the cavern at the hour ap-
pointed and paused on the verge of
one of the ledges looking about in the
uncertain light for mybaloe the moon
had begun to pour a faery radiance over
the rough edge of the pit in the cavern-
dome i saw a stealthy movement in the
waters beneath me where a crocodile slid
through the silver-gleaming ebony of the
surface but of mybaloe herself i could
find no visible sign anywhere i won-
dered if she were not hiding from me in
some prankish mood and resolved to
make a search of the alcoves and shelves
on tiptoe in order to surprize her

  i was about to leave the ledge on which
i stood when i received a violent push
from behind which precipitated me with
a headlong suddenness into the black pool
seven or eight feet below the waters
were deep and i sank almost to the
bottom before i recovered myself or even
realized what had happened then i rose
and struck out blindly for the shore re-
membering with a thrill of terror the
crocodile i had seen a moment before my
fall i reached the edge where it shelved

down with accessible gradations but the
water was still deep and my fingers
slipped on the smooth stone behind me

i heard a furtive rippling and knew its
causation all too well turning my head

i saw two of the great saurians whose
eyes burned with unholy phosphorescence
in the moonlight as they glided toward
me

  i think that i must have cried aloud
for as if in answer i heard a womans
voice cry out on the ledge above and
then the rippled waters were cleft by a
falling form that shone for an instant
with a flash as of black marble a breath-
less interval while the waters foamed
and then a well-known head arose beside
me and an arm that held aloft a glitter-
ing knife it was mybaloe herself with
miraculous adroitness she drove the knife
to its hilt in the side of the foremost
crocodile as the monster opened his
formidable jaws to seize me her stroke
had found the heart and the crocodile
slipped back beneath the surface thrash-
ing about in a brief agony but its com-
panion came on without pausing and
met the same unerring thrust of myba-
loes knife there were stirrings in the
pool and the dark bodies of others began
to appear with a superhuman agility
in what was seemingly no more than a
single movement mybaloe drew herself
out on the rocks of the margent and
caught my hands in hers an instant
more and i stood beside her hardly
knowing how i had come there so light
and swift had been my ascent the croco-
diles were nosing the shore beneath us
when i turned to look back

  breathless and dripping we sat on a
moon-bright shelf of the cavern and
began to question each other with tender
interludes of silence and caresses in a
few weeks i had learned much of the
the venus of azombeii



azombeiian tongue and we no longer
required an interpreter at any time

  to my astonishment mybaloe denied
having sent me a messenger that evening
she had returned because of an over-
whelming premonition of some imminent
evil that menaced me and had felt her-
self drawn irresistibly to the grotto ar-
riving just in time to find me floundering
in the pool while passing through the
cave of wanaos from which a low
tunnel led to the open grotto she had
met a man in the darkness and thought
that it might have been mergawe he
had passed without speaking in as much
haste as mybaloe herself i told her of
the push i had received from behind as i
stood on the ledge it was all too evi-
dent that i had been lured to the cavern
by some one who desired to make away
with me and as far as we knew mer-
gawe was the one person in azombeii
capable of conceiving or nurturing such
a motive mybaloe became very grave
and little more was said between us re-
garding the matter

  after our return to the village my-
baloe sent several men to search for
mergawe and bring him before her but
the sorcerer had disappeared and no one
could tell his whereabouts though more
than one person had seen him earlier in
the evening he did not return to his
dwelling on the morrow and though a
sedulous and thorough quest was insti-
tuted throughout the whole of azombeii
no trace of him could be found during
the days following his very disappear-
ance of course was taken for an implicit
confession of guilt supreme indignation
was rife among the people when the
episode in the grotto became publicly
known and in spite of the fear his
reputation had evoked mergawe would
have fared disastrously at their hands
and the sentence of death pronounced

against him by mybaloe would have been
needless if he had dared to show him-
self among his fellow-tribesmen

  the unexpected peril i had faced and
the marvelous rescue effected by mybaloe
served to draw us even closer together
and our passion found a new depth and
gravity henceforward but as time went
on and nothing was heard of mergawe
who seemed to have been swallowed up
by the wide and sultry silence of the
equatorial spaces the episode began to
recede and gradually dwindled to our
view in a lengthening perspective of
blissful days we ceased to apprehend
any further attempt at harm on the part
of the witch-doctor and were lulled to
an indolent security in which our happi-
ness took on the hues of its maturing
summer

one night the priests of wanaos were
giving a dinner in my honor forty
or fifty people were already gathered in
a banqueting-hall not far from the tem-
ple but mybaloe had not yet arrived as
we sat awaiting her a man entered bear-
ing a large calabash full of palm-wine
the man was a stranger to me though
he was evidently known to some of the
people present who hailed him by name
calling him marvasi

  addressing me marvasi explained
that he had been sent by the people of
an outland community with a gift of
palm-wine which they hoped that i as
the consort of mybaloe would deign to
accept i thanked him and bade him
convey my acknowledgment to the donors
of the wine

  will you not taste the wine now he
said i must return immediately but
before leaving i should like to learn if
the gift meets with your approval so that
i can tell my people

  i poured out some of the wine into a


weird tales

cup and drank it very slowly as one does
in testing the savor and quality of a bev-
erage it was quite sweet and heavy
with a peculiar after-flavor of puckerish
bitterness which i did not find altogether
agreeable however i praised the wine
not wishing to hurt marvasis feelings
he grinned with apparent pleasure at my
words and was about to depart when
mybaloe entered she was panting with
haste her expression was both wild and
stern and her eyes blazed with un-
natural fire rushing up to me she
snatched the empty wine-cup from my
fingers

  you have drunk it she cried in a
tone of statement more than of query 

  yes i replied in great wonder and
perplexity

  the look that she turned upon me was
indescribable and full of conflicting el-
ements horror agony devotion love
and fury were mingled in it but i knew
somehow that the fury was not directed
toward me for one intense moment her
eyes held mine then averting her face
she pointed to marvasi and bade the
priests of wanaos to seize and bind him
the command was instantly obeyed but
before offering any explanation and
without saying a word to me or to any-
one mybaloe poured out a cupful of the
palm-wine and drank it at a single draft
beginning to suspect the truth i would
have seized it from her hand but she
was too quick for me

  now we will both die she said
when she had emptied the cup for a
moment her face assumed a tranquil
smile then it became the countenance of
an avenging goddess as she turned her at-
tention to the wretched marvasi every
one present had now surmised the truth
and mutterings of rage and horror were
heard on all sides marvasi would have
been torn limb from limb joint from

joint muscle from muscle by the bare
hands of the priests if it had not been
for mybaloe who intervened and told
them to wait stricken with abject ter-
ror the man cowered among his captors
knowing too well the manner of doom
that would be meted out to him in spite
of any momentary reprieve

  mybaloe began to interrogate him in
brief stern sentences and marvasi whose
awe of her was even more patent than his
fear of the priests made answer with
many stammerings as he cringed and
fawned he confessed that the wine was
poisoned also that he had been hired by
the sorcerer and high-priest mergawe to
proffer it to me and see that i drank some
of it at once if possible mergawe he
said had been hiding in the forest on the
borders of azombeii for weeks living in
a secret cavern known only to himself
and a few adherents who had brought
him food and such news as he desired to
learn marvasi who was under certain
intimate obligations to mergawe and
had been used by him as a tool on other
occasions was one of these adherents

  where is mergawe now questioned
mybaloe marvasi would have hesitated
but the eyes of the queen ablaze with
anger and with superhuman mesmerism
dragged the very truth from his reluctant
lips he said that mergawe was now
lurking in the jungle on the outskirts of
the town of azombeii waiting for assur-
ance that the poison had been drunk by
its intended victim

  a number of the priests were at once
dispatched to find mergawe while they
were absent mybaloe told me how warn-
ing of the plan to poison me had been
brought to her by another of mergawes
friends who had recoiled at the final
hour from the atrociousness and audacity
of such a design

  the priests returned in a little while
                     w t-

bringing the captive sorcerer they had
succeeded in coming upon him unaware
and though he struggled with demoniacal
strength and fury they bore him down
and bound him with thongs of rhinoc-
eros hide they brought him into the
banqueting-hall amid a horror-frozen
silence

   in spite of his desperate predicament
the face of the sorcerer was full of a
malevolent triumph as he stood before
us proud and superbly erect he gave no
evidence of fear but his mien proclaimed
the satanic possession of an evil exulta-
tion before mybaloe could question or
address him he began to pour forth a
torrent of dreadful mouthings inter-
mingled with maledictions and vitupera-
tions he told us how he had prepared
the poison he enumerated the fearsome
ingredients the slowly chanted and leth-
iferous runes the manifold and mighty
power of the baleful fetishes that had
gone into or had helped in its making
then he described the action of the
poison the preliminary months during
which mybaloe and i would suffer in-
numerable pangs would die uncounted
deaths in our anticipation of the deferred
agonies to come and then the intermi-
nable tortures themselves the slow and
hideous contraction of all our fibers all
our organs the drying-up of the very
sources of life and the shrinkage to in-
fantile or even pre-infantile stature and
dimensions before the relief of death
forgetful of all but his mad hatred his
insensate jealousy he lingered over these
details he repeated them again and again
with so vile a gloating so horrible and
rapturous a relish that a sort of paralyz-
ing spell was laid upon the assembly and
no one stepped forward to silence him
with a knife or a spear

   at last while his mouthings continued
mybaloe filled another cup with the

poisoned wine and while the priests
held mergawe and forced his teeth apart
with their spear-blades she poured the
wine down his throat oblivious or con-
temptuous of his doom he betrayed no
slightest quiver or shrinking of fear but
glared with that awful look of exultation
all the while like a black fiend who re-
joices over the damned even though he
himself is numbered among them mar-
vasi was also compelled to drink the
wine and he cringed and cried with
terror frothing at the mouth when the
lethal liquor touched his tongue then
the two men by mybaloes order were
led away and imprisoned and were left
under a strong guard to await the work-
ing of the poison but later in the night
when their deed became known to the
populace a multitude of men and women
maddened beyond all measure or control
broke in and overpowered the guards and
carried marvasi and mergawe to the
grotto behind the cave of wanaos where
they were flung like offal to the croco-
diles in the black pool

   now for mybaloe and me there began
a life of indepictable horror dead was
all our former joy and happiness for the
blackness of the doom to come lay on us
like the charnel shadow cast by the gath-
ering of a myriad vultures love it is
true was still ours but love that already
seemed to have entered the hideous gloom
and nothingness of the grave    but of
these things i can not tell you though i
have told you so much    they were
too sacred and too terrible   

   after the leaden lapse of funereal
days beneath heavens from which for us
the very azure had now departed it was
agreed between mybaloe and me that i
should leave azombeii and return to my
native land neither of us could bear the
thought of having to witness day by day


weird tales

the eventual torments and progressive
physical disintegration of the other when
mergawes poison began to operate of
our farewell meeting i can say only that
it was infinitely sorrowful and that i
shall remember the love and grief in
mybaloes eyes amid the culminative
pangs and disordered illusions of my last
delirium before i left she gave me for
a keepsake the little image of wanaos
concerning which you have asked me so
often

  it is needless to detail my return to

america now after months of a delay
that has had in it nothing of mercy or
mitigation i feel the first workings of the 
poison i have recognized all its pre-
liminary symptoms and the sickening
expectations of haunted days and sleep-
forbidden nights are being realized and
knowing all that is yet to come and see-
ing with a clarity of imaginative vision
that sears my soul the coincidental
agonies of mybaloe i have begun to envy
the death of marvasi and mergawe in the
pool of crocodiles

  the seeds of death

by david h keller

a powerful mystery story of man-eating orchids and a beautiful tiger-woman
who lived in a castle in spain

the duke of freud was distinctly
unhappy he had spent a years in-
come in entertaining one lady who
had been so unappreciative that she de-
parted for paris at the end of the week
leaving the duke absolutely alone in new
york the worst part about the whole
affair was his gradually appreciating that
she had engaged her passage a week
before she vowed eternal devotion to him
irrespective of anything that he might do
the duke realized that his bankers would
make him no further advances for at
least another year the world was indeed
dreary other ladies would be impossible
without more money

  the spanish ambassador gave a very
profuse denial to his telegraphed request
for a loan the hotel where he had
luxuriated since his arrival in new york
became suspicious and sternly asked for

a settlement in full finally the duke
walked out on the sidewalk a free man
but all of his baggage and much of his
jewelry remained in the hotel for the
first time in his life the duke was without
visible means of support the manager
of the hotel had promised to let him
occupy his room for a few more days but
there were to be no more wonderful
meals served there

the duke visited a three-ball shop and
pawned some jewelry that he had man-
aged to conceal from the hotel manage-
ment then he bought some hard bread
and several evening papers and returned
to his room for the first time in his life
he read over the help wanted section
this innovation was more successful than
he had thought was possible there was
actually an advertisement in spanish
asking for a personal interview with pros-
the seeds of death



pea of interesting service in spain a
telephone number was given which was
to be used that evening only between the
hours of eight and ten this gave the
duke ample cause for refleaion as he
munched the hard bread and drank ice-
water

  it was a day of surprizes it started in
the morning with the unexpeaed de-
sertion of the lady and it ended at nine
that evening with a visit from the gentle-
man who had inserted the advertisement

  james garey lost no time in giving the
reason for the visit

  i am looking for a man he said
who is not afraid to die

  you have found him answered the
duke shrugging his shoulders in my

present condition i am better off dead
than alive of course he said refleaive-
ly it all depends on the manner of the

death

  that is the bad part of it the new
yorker said i think that death is there
waiting but i am not sure of what form
it takes it is a peculiar story in faa it
may be that you will find it even stranger
than i do or you may understand it i
had a brother who had everything in life
to live for-and he went to spain-to
visit a lady there-and he never came
back several other men that i have heard
of have visited that lady and they have
never come back the american ambas-
sador to spain has investigated the mat-
ter in fiaa he has personally been to see


weird tales

the lady and his report is a most inter-
esting one she admits that these men
have visited her she even shows where
they signed her guest book and in every
case she proves that in a few days they
left her castle in their automobiles she
regrets their disappearance she cries
pathetically as she recalls how happy
they were when they left and how they
promised to visit her again on their re-
turn to spain the lady is very wealthy
belongs to one of the oldest families in
spain and thus there can be no question
of robbery she is said to be well chap-
eroned as are all the spanish ladies and
she made a very favorable impression on
the ambassador so much so that he
scouted the idea of foul play

  i loved my brother and i believe that
he died in that castle i also think that
the other men died there so i am going
to visit her and i want you to follow me
four days after i enter that castle i want
you to visit the lady and i want you to
find out what happened to my brother if
i am alive i will help you if  am dead
it may make it easier for you to solve the
problem of my brother for the trail will
be fresher you will of course under-
stand that you are likely to die in the
same way that these other men have died
i wonder if i know the lady the
duke mused

  it may be that you do her name is
helen moyennes she seems to have
some kind of a title lots of money and
she lives in a very old castle on the moun-
tain top of andorra

  helen replied the duke is not a
spanish name

  perhaps not and perhaps the only
reason she is called a spanish lady is be-
cause she lives in spain she is a brunette
of uncertain age and the ambassador in
a personal letter to me commented on her
beauty

  i do not know her said the duke i
know a good many beautiful ladies but
not this one the last one i knew left for
paris this morning with jewels that cost
me a years income that is why i an-
swered your message in the newspaper i
will go on this adventure with you if the
lady kills me she will be the first lady
who has done so i suppose that this
ambassador will provide me with letters
of introduction and you will have to get
my clothes and jewelry out of pawn at
present the hotel holds them as security
i will get them for you and for the
rest of your time in new york you may
stay with me as my guest i am busy in
the daytime but every night for the next
week we will talk over our plans we
will leave for spain in a week in the
meantime i will make you an advance of
five thousand dollars and you can go
ahead and have as good a time as you
want in the daytime this may be your
last visit to new york

  you are not very cheerful

  i have no reason to be frankly i be-
lieve there is a good chance that i shall
die in that castle you may die there i
hope that one of us will clear up the
mystery of my brothers death then
there are some more men like southward
of atlanta and serriano of boston there
is one odd thing about these men that
have disappeared and that is they were
all fine specimens of manhood and they
were all traveling by themselves for
some reason all were in automobiles with-
out chauffeurs they went to that castle
there seems to be proof that they left the
castle-at least that is the statement that
the lady and her servants make and then
they simply dropped out of existence
how does it look to you

  i do not think they left the castle
answered the duke

  do you think that they are dead
the seeds of death



  either dead prisoners or so happy
that they are willing to shut themselves
off from all communication with the
world

  the new yorker shook his head
they may be dead or they may be
prisoners but these men are not staying
there voluntarily there are too many of
them-they would be jealous of each
other

  not if this helen were a messalina
or a circe

  no she is not that if she is she has
the ambassador badly fooled besides i
know my brother he was not averse to
a love affair with a lady but he never
would allow a rival in the field if ever
there was a jealous man in regard to the
ladies it was my brother i can imagine
him staying in that castle a lifetime with
this helen but not a minute after he
found out that there were other men
there if he is there he is kept there
either dead or a prisoner

  time will tell about this helen
sighed the duke you are sure she is
beautiful

  absolutely

  that one fact makes the adventure at-
tractive suppose you stop at the desk on
your way out and rescue my trunks to-
night i spend here tomorrow i come to
your abode as your humble guest a
month from now we may dine in para-
dise but tonight i shall rest better if i
have on my silken pajamas

for the next week the evenings were
spent in planning the spanish adven-
ture a hundred suggestions were made
only to be discarded finally they saw
what they had dimly seen from the first
james garey would visit this lady as her
house guest during those four days he
would try to solve the mystery of his
brothers disappearance on the fifth day

the duke of freud would arrive at the
castle he would either meet james
garey or he would not if he did not
then he could take it for granted that the
new yorker had fallen a victim to the
same fate that had overcome his brother
the same that had been the undoing of
southward of atlanta and serriano of
boston and other good men one plan
that was suggested was finally adopted
james garey was to wear a ring with a
large stone this stone had a peculiar
property when rubbed against other
stone or wood it left no mark when
however the moist skin as the palm or
finger tips rested on this place a red
stain appeared on the skin the two men
tried it and when garey carefully wrote
death on the top of the mahogany
table and the duke carefully pressed the
palm of his hand on this spot then the
word death appeared in red letters on
his hand

  that works very well commented
garey and the average person would be-
lieve that in this ring we had a very val-
uable way of communication but in re-
ality i doubt its real worth to us i could
not write messages all over a castle with-
out being seen and if i only wrote in a
few places you would never know where
those places were and would find them
only by accident if we both knew the
castle it would be different as it is the
best we can do is to presume that there
is one special guest room and if when
you come you have the good fortune to
be placed in the same room that i slept in
you will find a message from me on the
wall above the door

during the next week the duke had
to find some occupation for his
days the evenings being spent in appar-
ently useless conferences with his fellow
adventurer the duke was a peculiar com-


weird tales

bination of globe-trotter scholar and lib-
ertine naturally he drifted in these idle
moments to broadway and there on the
first day of his new life with garey a
sharper fleeced him out of a hundred dol-
lars by means of the old familiar shell
game one pea and three walnut shells
and you can see where i put the pea
gentlemen now back up your confidence
in yourself with a small bet the duke
was interested and envious it pained
him to think that any one could work a
trick like that on him so he took the
sharper into his confidence showed him
several unusual card tricks and offered
him another hundred if he would teach
him the trick he saw possibilities in
this as a valuable help in times of future
financial stringency and he was confident
that such times would come

he spent several hours with the shell
man and then started to practise again
and again he flipped the pea where he
wanted it for the next six days he prac-
tically lived with a pea and three walnut
shells in front of him on a table he
practised on the servants in the garey
household and finally was able to deceive
even the butler then he tried the game
on his employer and that worthy was
willing to admit that it was impossible to
keep his eye on the pea with any degree
of accuracy by the time the two men
sailed for england the duke was so
proficient that he was able to make a con-
siderable sum on the voyage-of course
in a very gentlemanly way

the plan of action determined on by
the two men was as follows garey was
going to the castle in andorra via paris
the duke was to go by way of barcelona
their date of departure from london was
so timed that the duke would arrive at
the castle exactly four days after garey
after leaving london the two men were
not going to communicate with each

other according to their program the
schedule seemed fool-proof as a final
protection a complete statement of the
entire plan with gareys suspicions and
a complete program of the intended in-
vestigation were sent in a sealed envelope
to the american ambassador at madrid
with the request that it be opened and
acted on if neither garey nor the duke of
freud called at the ambassadors office be-
fore a certain date

  the parting at london was rather dull
both men were depressed in the short
time that they had been associated with
each other they had developed a decided
friendship they were drawn together by
a sense of impending danger the duke
became almost melodramatic in his pro-
fuse promises to leave no stone unturned
to unravel the mystery and if necessary
to avenge the threatened death of james
garey so they said good-bye

some weeks later the duke of freud
slowly drove his isotta-fraschini up
the winding mountain road that led to
the castle in andorra occupied by the fair
helen moyennes in his pocket he car-
ried a letter of introduction from the
american ambassador on his fedora a
small blue-bird feather shone in the cold
clear sunlight and in his breast his heart
beat almost as fast as the slow explosion
of his engine-for the path was so steep
that even his powerful car was forced to
go up on low gear a little village hud-
dled as though in fear at the bottom of
this mountain the duke considered
pausing a few minutes to obtain the re-
action of these mountain folk to the grand
lady who lived in every way above them
on the top of the mountain however he
ended by driving through without a stop

  accustomed though he was to spanish
architecture this castle impressed him as
being somewhat out of the usual a castle
the seeds of death



so old as to be dninfluenced by the moor-
ish occupancy of spain a large pile of
stone so massive that it towered above the
peak and yet the individual rock was so
weatherbeaten and covered with moss and
fern that at some turns of the winding
road it came into sudden view not as a
castle but rather as a part of the ageless
mountain there may have been windows
in the walls but these were so narrow
and the walls so thick that they showed
as lines rather than modern apertures

  the duke had spent a few hours talk-
ing with a celebrated spanish historian
about this castle the opinion given by
this antiquarian was that the building
was very old in some respects the archi-
tecture was norman in other ways the
gothic influence showed and the best
description available included a row of
columns that were said to be roman it
seems that no one had occupied the place
for many years and then this very rich
lady helen moyennes had bought the
place and had now lived there for five
years no one that the duke talked to in
madrid seemed to know much about this
new owner of the castle even the police
department had no knowledge of her past
and very little of her present she spent
money lavishly and was very prompt in
paying her bills also in some way she
had powerful political influence that
was all that the duke found out about
her

  now he was going up to the castle
and for all he knew he might never
come down again

  all the men that had gone up that
road had been well educated some of
them had by their personal efforts be-
come rich there was not one fool among
them and yet none of them had come
back

  what had happened to them were
they staying there in the castle from
choice

  or were they dead

  he came near the top of the moun-
tain just as the sun was sinking for its
long nights rest streaks of light hov-
ered in long neurasthenic fingers on the
castle walls throwing the ancient rocks
into every possible shade of syncopating
grays a low wind moaning upward
from the valley whined miserably around
the massive walls the road came to an
abrupt pause before a great gateway with
a gothic arch its deep shadows showing
the wonderful thickness of the walls
the gate was shut the engine puttered
to a pause and silence hovered over the
castle with the downy wings of twilight
teasing the anxious mind to thoughts of
depressed mystery

  the duke had in his youth received
an excellent literary education now
lines from the deep well of his subcon-
scious came over his mental threshold-
childe roland to the dark tower came-
fee fie fo fum i smell the blood of an
englishman-and blew his horn with-
out being really aware of what he was
doing he looked in back of him to see
if there was room to swing his automo-
bile around and start down the hill
there was no one there to see him ap-
parently his arrival had not been noticed
while he was thinking these thoughts
he saw the great gate divide in the mid-
dle and slowly swing open apparently
he had been seen and die way had been
provided for him to drive into the court-
yard

  starting the car he glided into the
courtyard and stopped a noise made
him look backward and the gate was al-
ready closing

  the lady wants to keep me the duke
muttered to himself

  and then an old woman came from a
little doorway toward the car in span-
ish she asked him to follow her he


weird tales

pretended not to understand and she re-
peated the request in very good english
the duke shrugged his shoulders and
thought that it was very much like a page
out of perraults fairy-tales

  the old dame took him to a bedroom
that was a curious combination of the
very old and the ultramodern for in-
stance a completely furnished bathroom
provided every possible convenience to
the dusty traveler a sad-faced valet was
in attendance and the dukes baggage
had bean brought up with him and was
being unpacked by die black-clothed ser-
vant the sound of running water as-
sured him that a bath was being drawn
as in a dream he heard the servant ask
if he wished to be shaved or would he
prefer to shave himself it was all per-
fect

  half an hour later another sad-faced
man entered and asked him if he was
ready for supper it seemed that the
lady moyennes awaited the dukes pleas-
ure in the supper room somehow it did
not seem real to the duke there was too
much regularity to it too much that he
could not understand it seemed as
though he were an actor in a play that
went too smoothly-ah that was it
it had to be well done because it had
been so often done by these servants-
how often had that sad-faced valet drawn
the bath for some bright-faced anticipat-
ing young man who sought adventure
and love in andorra where were those
young men now and would he play
the same part in the tragedy that they
had played

  he told the butler that he would be
ready in a few minutes and took one of
his suitcases into the bathroom and
closed the door there was an automatic
in that piece of baggage but when he
took it up and looked at it he found
that all of the cartridges had been taken

out he could not believe that this had
happened since he arrived at the castle
was it possible that a confederate in the
hotel in which he had passed last night
had made him defenseless at least
this was the first sign of danger and was
depressingly suggestive he was glad
that he had that dagger in its leather
case strapped to his leg under his trou-
sers it would not be as useful as a re-
volver but in a pinch he could use it to
good advantage at least it made him
feel better to have it strapped on his leg
going into the bedroom he told the but-
ler that he was read to follow him to
the supper table

in a room that was so small that a
charming sense of intimacy was pos-
sible but with so high a ceiling that the
candles failed to show any of its detail
the lady helen moyennes awaited the
duke of freud the aristocratic span-
iard was well acquainted with the beauty
of the feminine world but even his
blase soul was aroused by the superb
woman who faced him he dimly felt
that she was tall but there was a del-
icacy about her that minimized her
height her closely fitting decollete en-
semble showed a form that was almost
massive and still there was but little
indication of the tremendous strength
that must be associated with such a pow-
erful body all this and a hundred other
thoughts flashed through the dukes mind
as he bent forward to kiss her out-
stretched hand her long fingers end-
ing in pointed nails gathered together
his varied fragmentary thoughts into a
harmonious whole

  he thought to himself this woman
is a tiger all ladies are cats but this
beautiful one is a supercat

  if lady helen had any other thought
save that of bored politeness she did not
the seeds of death



show it in her attitude in a minute they
were at the small table set for two

  i always have the service set for a
guest explained the languid woman
life here is dull but now and then
from all over the world very exceptional
people drop in on me so i am always
prepared day and night a watchman is
on the wall when an automobile ar-
rives at the gate he has orders to open it
after it is in the courtyard there is time
enough to learn the business of the occu-
pant with me of course important
guests like yourself are always antic-
ipated and prepared for it is necessary
to do this especially in regard to the
food you realize that most men enjoy
good meals and the habits gastronomical
of different nations are so different you
are my first spanish guest is that not
odd men from england and italy and
even a very wonderful turk to say noth-
ing of those charming but rather blunt
americans have visited me but never till
this evening have i had the pleasure of
entertaining a real member of the span-
ish nobility naturally when i heard
that you were arranging to see me i
wondered what i could do to make this
visit one that you would remember-it
seemed to me that a man with your sense
of beauty needed something more than
a heavy supper so i thought it would be
fitting to make you a little present even
before you taste the grapefruit manuel
bring in that silver casket and place it
before the duke

  a massive jewel case was placed on
the snow-white linen cloth

  now my dear duke almost purred
lady helen when i heard that you
were on your way to see me i thought
that it would be best to give you jewels
-not just ordinary jewels but some very
fine ones that would have a special sig-
nificance to you so i arranged to obtain

some in paris a very notorious young
lady arrived there a few weeks ago and
i obtained some from her that she had
brought from new york you are so
fond of jewels perhaps you may have
seen these before also there is a ring

  the puzzled duke opened the lid of
the jewel case and carefully examined
the individual pieces it did not take
long for him to recognize them as the
ones that he had spent a years income
on and at the bottom of the box a
ring of course there are often many
rings in the world that look exactly alike
and yet as the duke looked at it he was
struck at the resemblance to the ring worn
by james garey but this was no time to
betray himself by any outward show
either of anxiety or of perplexity he
slowly broke into one of those famous
smiles that made him such a charming
favorite with the other sex

  you have conquered me he ex-
claimed i never could resist jewels
courtesy on my part demands that i ac-
cept this gift and i am sure that your
sense of pity for a beauty-starved man
will make you willing to grant my re-
quest and wear these jewels during the
rest of my visit when i take them with
me they will be all the more precious
to me because you have worn them at
least for a little while this ring how-
ever i will at once put on and cherish
for there will be hours as your guest
that convention will deny me the sight of
your smile and during those lonely
hours the wearing of this ring will com-
fort me till you again dispel the midnight
of my sorrow with the dawn of your fair
face

  i think that was very nicely said re-
plied the lady helen i am beginning
to regret the wasted years during which
i never even realized how charming
a true spaniard could be i feel that


weird tales

my cosmopolitan tastes have played me
false and in my search for a real man i
have been unfortunate enough-and met
you only tonight

they smiled at each other and began
to eat

soon he selected a bracelet and begged
for the opportunity of personally placing
it on her wrist in touching her skin he
felt a warm vibrant tingling thrill that
roused the slumbering silences of his
masculine ego

again she smiled on him as she said
for years i have been looking for a real
man

lazily leaning toward her he whis-
pered i trust that from tonight on you
need no longer look

i want a man that will gamble with
life-and love

you have found that man

i am in great trouble

i will share it with you

the meal finally ended-with the but-
ler discreetly absent no chaperon in sight
and a close harmony already existent be-
tween the tiger woman and the spaniard
who was already wondering just what the
end would be of the game that he was
playing however he did not wait long
for she suddenly asked him to excuse
her she was tired and felt that he was
also fatigued with the events of the day
she promised to see him on the morrow
and to confide in him to tell him her
troubles but just now-a white arm
stretched toward him a white hand
rested on his to receive his nocturnal salu-
tation-and then the butler appeared to
escort him to his bedroom

dully he closed the door he found
the valet waiting and told him that
there was nothing more for the night
after the servant had left he locked the
door and lit several candles carefully

he examined the plaster on each side of
the doorway it was scratched with the
wrinkles of antiquity he placed his
hands first on one place and then another
against the wall and after each pressing
looked carefully at the palm finally a
red mark appeared on the skin he re-
placed the palm exactly over that piece
of plaster and held it there while he
counted thirty this time a little flag
showed on his palm and it was a red
flag the red flag of danger the duke
laughed silently he did not need a red
flag to tell him of the danger he was in
poor old james garey-he had meant
well-but where was he now a sud-
den thought came to him he took the
ring on his finger and carefully wrote the
word danger on the white plaster
when he had finished there was no
mark visible but when he pressed against
it with his palm the word appeared in
red letters on his moist skin

there was no mistake on his finger
was the ring that james garey had worn
when he entered the castle he had worn
it long enough to trace the warning flag
-perhaps he had tried to leave other
messages-but now the ring was on
another mans finger and where was
garey how much did this devil of a
woman know she had known about his
buying those jewels for the woman in
new york and had been able to antic-
ipate his visit in time to recover those
jewels and give them to him of course
it was a left-handed gift she could take
them away from him-but that was not
what was worrying him how did she
know about the woman who went to
paris in what way had she found out
that he was going to visit her she must
have known that almost before he and
garey left america any one could see
that the very fact that she gave him
gareys ring showed that she had a fair
the seeds of death



idea of what that ring could be used for

with a deep sigh the duke undressed
and went to bed garey was either dead
or alive according to the whims of this
woman so were all the other young
men who had been drawn to this castle by
rumors of the wondrous beauty of the
owner well reflected the spaniard
tomorrow will tell the tale the tigress
must have some weak spot but what in
the name of all the holy saints is her
reason what is she a real woman or
a salamander

the morning came and with it the
sad-faced valet a bath and a very remark-
able breakfast served in the bedroom
later came a message from the lady she
had heard that the duke could drive a
car would he object to showing her
his ability the duke did not object
but for the next three hours teased death
a thousand times on the steep roads bor-
dered on one side by high mountains and
on the other side by ravines that seemed
to have no landing-place as one thrill
followed another the woman by the
dukes side became enthusiastic

you can drive a car she purred i
think you are a real man

finally they returned to the castle
the lady pleading indisposition
begged to be excused but promised to
meet the duke at the supper table there
dressed in an oriental fantasy of laces
and pearls she appeared more charming
than ever but it was not her beauty
nor yet the excellent food that impressed
the duke rather it was a flower that she
wore on her corsage this flower though
its stem was blood-red had white pet-
als almost dead-white and thick as
though made of wax the stamens and
pistils were red but that was not the re-
markable thing about them they were

long and seemed to move caressingly over
the white bust of the lady helen moyen-
nes and when the ends of the red sta-
mens touched her skin the woman
seemed to be pleased

for a while the duke thought that he
was imagining all this-he did not wish
to be impolite by looking too long at the
flower and at the low-cut gown that it
was pinned on he shivered it was
fastened by a gold snake perhaps it
would be best for him not to drink any
more of course it was just a gold
snake but-damn it-what made the
eyes glitter that way

the lady noticed his close attention
she laughingly asked do you like my
flower

it is beautiful because of its location
may i ask the name

i do not know i have a few plants
growing here occasionally one blos-
soms and then i wear it though often i
prefer the blossom to go to seed do
you like it would you like to see one
grow you may if you stay here i
should like to have you do that you are
a real man for years i have wanted a
real man-one who could make me love
him and fear him and shrink under his
wild caresses some of the men who have
visited me have been such gentlemen that
they bored me

i think i should like to see the
plants answered the duke and un-
der certain circumstances life might be
very pleasant here

if once you saw the plants you
would want to stay you are like all the
other men-so jealous but we have
come to the end of the supper you
were so busy watching my orchid that
you did not eat much it is early let
us go to another room and play a game
of cards do you know any new game of
chance


weird tales

  the duke thought of his three walnut
shells he excused himself and guided
by the butler went to his bedroom to get
them on his return the lady helen
preceded him to a small room it is
interesting to note that during the days
that the duke stayed at the castle he never
learned its geography sufficiently to find
his way without a guide

  the lady awaited him in a small room
hung with black velvet drapes the
floor was covered with a carpet so thick
that the silent footfalls sounded like the
ghostly steps of pedestrians long dead
in the center of the room a small card
table and two chairs provided ample fur-
niture for a card game on one side of
the table an iron stand provided support
for an ash-tray of jade even as he was
sitting down the duke saw that this iron
was shaped like a dragon a rather hid-
eous feminine dragon with red eyes he
wished those eyes did not stare that way

  so between cigarettes the two showed
each other tricks of cards and walnut
shells and finally of very proper almost
sedate early victorian love lady hel-
en was fascinated by the shell game
she finally admitted that the dukes abil-
ity was too much for her

  pleased he boasted the hand is
quicker than the eye

  that night on returning to the room
where his valet awaited him he quietly
shut and barred the door he kept the
servant busy with a few odd tasks while
he took off his evening clothes and put
on a more comfortable soft-collared shirt
and slippers then almost before the
valet knew what had happened the duke
had him on the floor with the sharp
point of a very business-like dagger press-
ing against his throat

  now you can get me the ammuni-
tion for my gun he whispered

  your gun is loaded sir

  you are a liar

  no the next morning after you
came she told me to load it

  the duke carefully searched the man
to see that he had no weapons and then
with the dagger still pressed against his
jugular vein made him walk over and
open the traveling-bag a seconds in-
spection satisfied him that the man had
told the truth the revolver was loaded
that only served to give the duke one
more thing to think about

  he replaced the dagger in his leg
sheath having far more confidence in a
gun then he told the valet to sit down
in front of him the time had come for
a cessation of courtesies the duke careful-
ly explained to the valet

  i am satisfied that you know a great
deal about this place continued the
duke i am going to speak very slowly
so you will be sure to understand my
meaning i am confident that you have
served all the gentlemen who have vis-
ited your mistress probably the same
program is rendered for each of us
now you have your choice you can
either tell me all about it or you can have
me slit your throat what about it

  i will tell you all i know sir

  you will

  yes i will tell everything

  why what is the reason for your
eagerness a good servant would die
rather than betray his madam

  she told me years ago that whenever
this sort of thing happened i should
always tell

  so other men have threatened you
yes sir mr james garey bruised
me severely

  i see and where is mr garey
now

  he saw a change come into the mans
eyes he seemed to be looking over the
dukes head and just then the span-
the seeds of death



iard sensed a strange perfume and felt a
soft hand on his shoulder as her voice
said why not have me tell you

he whirled in his chair and faced hel-
en moyennes

she smiled at him and even in his
worried rage he saw that it was a tender
solicitous smile a pleasant comprehen-
sive smile that should have disarmed his
suspicions

you are a little like all the other men
ferdinand duke of freud i tell you
that i am in trouble and that you can
help me and at once you think the worst
things about me that you can and try to
corrupt or threaten my servants why
were you not frank i gave you jewels
i even offered to share everything with
you - for the rest of my life i am
afraid that i love you ferdinand

the spaniard looked at her he felt
that she was either speaking the truth or
was a wonderful actress 

i think that i shall call your bluff
helen moyennes he answered if
you will tell me the mystery of the mis-
sing men and give an explanation that is
satisfactory to me i will accept it as proof
of your love and i think that you are
beautiful and lovely enough for me to
spend the rest of my life with-and when
i love a woman i usually satisfy her
that would suit me i think that
when i tell you my story you will under-
stand of course the men are dead-at
least most of them-but if they wanted
to kill themselves am i to blame come
into my private rooms and let me tell you
about it

i will but this valet goes along

to what purpose what does he
know that i can not tell you

and you are going to tell me every-
thing

everything

the spaniard followed the woman
into her room his dagger had
been replaced in its leather case but he
held the revolver in his right hand he
was very careful walking down the long
hall he did not favor a knife-thrust from
behind in the dark

  once in her bedroom he sat with his
back to the wall no confederate of this
tigress was going to get the best of him
from that place of security he noted for
the first time that since supper time the
lady had changed her dress now she
had on a white lace negligee that gave a
general impression of extreme intimacy
in fact the duke felt that it was intended
to impress him-to pity and perhaps to
other more subtle emotions the orchid
that she had worn at supper was now in
a vase on the center table

  you are so odd ferdinand began
the lady please put that revolver away
or i shall scream what do you want to
do shoot me of course you could
do that but how explain matters to my
servants or the american ambassador
do you know him he certainly is a
dear he came here to investigate me
and i really believe that had he been
younger and not so great an official he
would have remained here-longer at
least he gave me a wonderful recommen-
dation he sent me a copy of it and i
could see that he was shocked at the way
people were talking about me a lone
woman must be very careful in fact
she must be above suspicion and when
i told the ambassador my story and
showed him my guest book why the
only thing for him to do was to think
that these dear boys had accidentally driv-
en their cars over one of our precipices

  i came here some years ago and
bought this castle i spent a large sum
in making it suitable as a residence for
the best kind of people of course i


weird tales

hoped that now and then i should have
company so i prepared a series of guest
chambers there were any number of
old four-poster beds and i had these put
into the new guest rooms and at last i
began to be known just a little people
in paris and moscow and new york be-
gan to whisper about this castle and
finally a man called from moscow he
was a nervous fellow always putting
things in his mouth one day we were
walking through the forest and we saw
some red seeds on the ground near the
skeleton of a horse they looked exactly
like pomegranate seeds this russian
nobleman put some in his mouth and that
night he became unconscious of course
i was worried because i was sure that his
friends would think that i had poisoned
him after some weeks of unconscious-
ness he died i went back to the forest
and picked up all of the seeds that were
scattered around and i brought them
back and planted some and they would
not germinate the more i worried the
worse i felt and just when it seemed that
i could not bear the suspense any longer
a man by the name of southward from an
american town called atlanta came to
see me he had heard of me in paris
i was young then and i thoughtlessly
told him about the russian and asked
him to help me unravel the mystery he
was a doctor this american and he
asked me to let him see the seeds i
showed them to him and he examined
them he cut one open and looked at it
through a pocket microscope and finally
he said that it was just a hard seed and he
said that it was like a pomegranate and
that it was not the cause of the russians
death because it would never be dis-
solved in his stomach-it was too hard
and he thought the man had died of a
disease he called uremia i cried and
told him how relieved i was to know all

this and could he prove it to me-if he
could he would win my everlasting grat-
itude what did he do but at once put
a seed in his mouth and swallow it and
he became unconscious and died-just
like the russian and that made two

  the affair shadowed my life it made
me broody introspective i was no long-
er the gay girl that had come so buoy-
antly to this castle in search of adventure

  and then the blossoms came and of
all the things in my life that i have had
those wonderful blossoms were the most
precious you saw me wear one tonight
at supper at present it is on the table
when i have one i am a different
woman - without one i am sad de-
pressed and aged so now i had two
things to live for one to solve the mys-
tery of the seeds and the other to have a
plentiful supply of blossoms

  james garey was the first man who
acted in the least bit unfriendly i knew
that you were going to come and i knew
that he would accuse me of the death of
his brother naturally i was prepared
yet i determined to be honest with him
and tell him the whole story he decided
to kill me but at the last he said he would
give me a gamblers chance he had the
idea that the red seeds had killed his
brother i showed him a bottle full and
at the same time allowed him to compare
them with real seeds of the pomegranate
he said there was a little difference so
we put a red seed and a pomegranate seed
on the card table and cut for the low
card the high card allowed the fortu-
nate one to swallow the pomegranate
seed while the one who cut low was to
swallow the seed that he felt was so
poisonous i cut low so i swallowed the
red seed and he took the harmless seed
and in a few hours he was silent in the
embrace of the slowly approaching death
the seeds of death



you notice i am still alive so some-
thing else killed garey what

the duke smiled perhaps or at
the last moment you switched the seeds
on him

no he was fortunate he won out
in the cards do you know he followed
me around as long as he could walk and
of course waited to see me become a
hopeless cripple and you should have
seen the look of hopeless terror on his
face when he found out that he could not
walk or talk he gambled with death
and lost

so one and all those brave boys are
dead

no garey is still alive and one or
two others but the rest are really dead
lady helen moyennes you are a
liar if i thought that you were telling
the truth i would kill you right there i
would fill that lovely body full of bullet
holes but you are trying to deceive me
you are eidier insane or a great actress i
should not be surprized to have the door
open and all these former lovers of yours
walk in as the animals did at circes ban-
quet such a tale as you tell for chil-
dren or fools

i am not a liar here is a bottle
filled with seeds and-why there is one
of the flowers

the flowers asked the duke what
in the name of the holy saints has the
flower to do with the seed

the seed finally matures the flower
and the bloom is what i live for

but-i do not understand

you will when you see the men
come with me suppose we see james
garey first he will have his eyes open
but he is really unconscious at least it is
best to think so

the lady led the spaniard into a
guest room passing down the hall
he recognized at least one faa that he

was passing by the door of his own room
then they entered the next room fool
that he was had garey been separated
by only a wall from help all the time
since the duke had arrived they entered
the room and the duke saw that in prac-
tically every detail it was furnished like
his own and garey was on the bed

   his eyes were open he was in pa-
 jamas and but lightly covered with a
 white silk sheet on his face was a puz-
 zled look without looking at the woman
 by his side the duke took the sick mans
 hand it was warm the man was
 breathing but the arm when released
 dropped flaccid on the bed

  garey garey dont you know
me the duke pleaded

   the soul seemed to answer in gareys
 eyes the soul and nothing else

   the dukes finger nervously touched
 the trigger of the revolver

   dont shoot me yet jeered the ti-
 gress wait till you have seen the rest
 of them let us go into the other rooms

   in the next room another man lay on
 the bed in the same paralyzed attitude

   the lady said in a low voice this is
 a south american i was so disgusted
 with him that in some way he swal-
 lowed a seed with his salad he has lost
 a good many pounds in the last week if

 i	were not sure of his loss of sensibility

 i	should think from his expression that
 he was in pain

   in the next room the woman paused
 to turn on the elearic lights if you
 look at this man closely you will see that
 he also is still alive but not doing very
 well see the little green tendrils com-
 ing out of his mouth and nose the root
 formation has now reached a point at
 which the plant is able to reach the sur-
 face naturally there is a profound dis-
 turbance of all of the vital organs

  let us go into the next room a


weird tales

  lovely boy serriano of boston is there
a greek god he was when he came here
and i would have saved him if i could
but he was so stubborn lets pass
through this connecting door see how
thin his face is and shrunken his arms
but the plant is growing rampant it is
sending up its branches over the bed-
posts and down over the floor see the
little buds in another two weeks the
blossoms will appear i am sure that
serriano has been dead for some days

i	loved that boy and i am so glad that
he did not suffer

  in this next room is the reason for
your being here yes you have guessed
it-the brother of garey a surprize
awaits you come through this door
do you notice this odor have you ever
had an experience like this the most
wonderful orchid in all the world my
passion flower

  on the bed in this room was what
had once been a man now he seemed
little more than a bag of skin and bones
but the room was filled with rustling
swaying vines and a dozen flowers like
those the tigress had worn on her cor-
sage filled the room with a cloying frag-
rance that was almost unearthly and un-
endurable the lady helen took one
by the stem and held it near her bosom
and at once the pistils began tenderly to
brush the skin

  she laughed see my darlings
know me how glad they are to have me
near the others are disappointed jeal-
ous they want to love me too

  so that is gareys brother the duke
asked slowly

  yes he was a fine man so far he
has produced more blossoms than any i
have ever had but let us see the others
suppose we skip two or three rooms and
go to the last room that will give you
an idea of the end and i know you will

  agree with me that it is not so bad not
so very bad

this last room was furnished like the
others but the plant was dead the
thing that had been a man was now dried
leather cracked and broken between
the cracks could be seen the dead dried
roots that had eaten him till nothing re-
mained and these had then died of hun-
ger on the bedposts over the floor the
dead leaves lay in dry rot but the seed
pods hung a plentiful harvest from the
end of many a stem

here we reap the harvest this is
the man from moscow tomorrow i
will come with my glass bottle and save
every seed and have the room clean and
precise for the next visitor

there will be no tomorrow and no
more visitors

so this is the end

precisely

then let me go and gather some
of the flowers from garey - for my
funeral

they returned to the room where the
massive blooms filled the air with the
odor of ethereal decay gently the lady
broke off half a dozen but in spite of
her care the torn stems bled and covered
her white negligee with blood she
pressed the bouquet to her face and the
duke shuddered as he saw dozens of long
twitching stamens caress her cheeks and
eyelids

now we will go back to any of your
rooms commanded the duke and you
can prepare to join garey

at least it will be a pleasure to die
at the hands of such a gentleman i am
sure that it will give you a thrill to kill a
defenseless woman

it will give me a great joy

still smelling the flowers she saun-
tered to the card room

seated at one chair she begged the
                     w t-
the seeds of death



duke to occupy the other the card
table was between them

so you are going to kill me

no on second thought i am going
to tie you up and take you in my car to
madrid and there i am going to turn you
over to the authorities

they will never believe you

they can come and see for them-
selves

by that time my servants will have
all the rooms clean and fresh ferdi-
nand you are a fool you know you can
not make the people in madrid believe
you you had better kill me here of
course you can not get out of the castle
alive right now a half-dozen guns are
pointed at your heart why not be a
sport lets compromise you write a
letter to the american ambassador that
you and james garey are leaving for nice
and that you know everything is all right
here then we will play a game of
cards if i lose i will take one of my
own seeds and you a pomegranate i have
one of those fruits here i will let you
cut it open and satisfy ycurself that there
is no fraud i will call in my men and tell
them that if you win they are to give you
safe passage i understand you are a
gambler-lets try fate select your own
game

i will do that little thing said the
duke smiling as he reached in his pock-
et for the three walnut shells let me
cut the pomegranate i want to look at
those seeds put one of your seeds be-
side it god they are alike now
call your men and tell them your orders
and we will begin

the lady clapped her hands and from
behind the velvet curtains stepped
six men she had not lied she told
these six that she and the duke were play-
ing for high stakes and if she lost they
w t-

were to let the man go free she called
for pen and ink and paper and had the
duke write to the american ambassador
about the trip to nice then she told
the six men that they could leave the
room

  you will learn in eight hours who
won she told them but if this guest
wins let him go free if i win we will
have you take the letter to madrid now
ferdinand explain this new american
game

  i have here three half walnut shells
began the duke i will use a pome-
granate seed i will give you three
chances to tell under which shell i put
the seed best two out of three wins
if i win i eat a pomegranate seed and
you one of those seeds of death if you
win the tables will be reversed i warn
you that the hand is quicker than the
eye

  i will have some wine brought com-
mented the lady helen we will
need something to wash the seeds down
my mouth is dry already is it not queer
fantastic that i can not stand excitement
feel my hand how it shakes

  i do not care to feel your hand

  a few hours ago you said that you
loved me

  i love you as i do death come be
a sport do you understand the rules
good now watch me closely as i wave
my hand over the shell there it is
now under one which one the right
end wrong it was in the center now
again watch me this is your life at
stake now which one the center
wrong again it was on the left side
you have lost twice and you pay now
is the time for my gun here is the glass
of wine take a seed out of that bottle
and swallow it one false move and i
blow your brains out now i will dig out
one of these pomegranate seeds and drink


weird tales

it down with wine now we each have
a seed i understood you to say that it
worked in eight hours so we will sit
here till morning if you move i will
kill you anyway i am not going to leave
you till i know that you have started the
long road that those brave young fools
took you had a good time but now your
time has come to an end

sighing the lady put down her glass
so this is the end she said well
have you any objection to my playing sol-
itaire some men would have liked to
hold me in their arms these last eight
hours of life but you are so different
ferdinand at times you seem to be un-
necessarily cold it is better to die than
to live a lifetime with you you would
not satisfy

she started to play solitaire hour
after hour she shuffled and dealt four
hours passed and then five and six she
had not spoken but the duke noticed
that her movements were gradually be-
coming slower and at times she swayed
in her chair as though she were drunk

at last his curiosity overcame him
do you feel sick he asked

i feel very peculiar i think that
soon i shall be unable to play

he watched her carefully seven and
a half hours passed and she just sat there
motionless looking at him with glazed
eyes sighing and tired he took his re-
volver and placed it in his pocket then
folding his hands on the table he waited
for the end

he judged that the eight hours were
up and started to look at his watch but
his hands stayed folded on the table he
tried to get up and he just sat there

then the woman stretched like a lazy
cat she stretched her long bare arms
above her head and yawned

it has been a long tiresome night

ferdinand she said you look sleepy
yourself that was an interesting game
you played your idea that the hand was
quicker than the eye is right you never
did see me plant those seeds in a pome-
granate or palm a harmless seed so that
it looked as though i took one from the
glass bottle

  the duke looked at her with smolder-
ing hate the fire of hell in his eyes but
he was helpless the virus from the seed
of death had already prostrated his ner-
vous system and he was started on the
long road that the other brave men had
taken

  the tigress clapped her hands and in
walked the butler and the valet with-
out a word they took the duke and car-
ried him to his bed on that bed he was
destined to lie till his body turned to
bones skin and dust then the woman
clapped her hands again and when
another servant came she gave him the
letters to the american ambassador with
orders to mail it then she went to her
bedroom talking softly to herself

  i am tired she said and slightly
nauseated i do not seem to stand excite-
ment as well as i did once well that
makes one more fool i wonder when i
can stop certainly not so long as i gain
such wonderful delight from my darling
blossoms

  the sunlight was streaming through
her bedroom windows slowly she un-
dressed and with her six orchids in her
hand she sank luxuriously into the
downy softness of her bed she placed
the blossoms on her shoulders neck and
face and quivering shut her eyes

  the flowers awakened and stretching
forth their tremulous pistils and stamens
stroked her skin

  with a convulsive effort she gathered
them to her lips and kissed them till she
slept
black man and white witch

by watson rawkins

an eery tale of an african slave-ship on which blindness and
death held sway

this was the third night of drifting the sea-fowl the sun and stars and moon
for the big black naked african but now in the bright tropic moonshine
savage upon his raft of wreckage the towering brigantine came down upon
he had as yet spoken nothing save the sea him across the plain of silver


weird tales

he was a koromantin from the unsub-
dued mountains of the ashanti gold
coast here sole survivor he was of those
five hundred and eighty stripped human
chattels men and women with which
stacked below deck like books the portu-
guese slaver flor de felicidade--flower
of happiness-had put out from whydah
roads of the west african slave marts

ere the discharge of the cuban planta-
tions there should have been for him and
those ignorant all six weeks of fetid
gloom suffocation and thirst but an eye
plague had spread like fire in a cane vil-
lage

she had done it with her witchcraft
she the slim white witch girl-wife of that
hated captain-the woman who hovering
near the deck barricades from aloof had
gazed with large curious eyes to murmur
charms while he and others supped from
their pannikins or danced at the bidding
of the lash

her eyes had often been fixed upon
him koromantin of the mountains and of
a free people who despised the lowland
jungle dwellers and her murmurs had been
directed his way but he had answered
look with look unafraid in his country
he was a headman and a great man the
white witch might do her worst and he
would not bow or cry out what was her
pleasure in saddling them the already
wretched with her curse

his fetish proved to be stronger than
hers for the red-eye curse passed him by
but through the slave-deck quarters dark
smothersome black with prone figures
speaking different tongues where news
carries like news among stable brutes
there were groans burdened with fresh
misery and curses vainly answering curse

captain fezarri had acted promptly
the first black discovered with the dread-
ed blindness had been thrown overboard
along with his shackle-mate and with

others who had lain near the next morn-
ing a score of culprits were revealed they
went over and through succeeding days
of baffling calms and head winds the drift
and wake of the flower of happiness
were specked with shark fins and with
wallowing forms

the half-drunken ships doctor was
busy with his own men there was only
the one remedy expensive but thorough
to be applied to those cattle below while
praying for a stiff breeze which might
sweep her slave-hold clean of contagion
the flower of happiness dogged by her
lading of pestilence blundered upon her
sluggish way like a craft condemned

the black man as well as the white
man however had his gods-weak
though they seemed to be the lookout of
the flower of happiness reported the
square-sails of a brig tacking in upon her
course captain fezarri nimble yellow
barefooted and knife-scarred in a cheek
took but a squint then he ordered every-
thing slow and aloft clapped on for the
stranger was a british cruiser

in the thinned slave-tiers underneath
fastened hatch gratings the big koroman-
tin had known all he had read the
shrieks and the strangled cries and he
missed companions in misery now he
and his fellows might dully wonder over
the new repeated loud commands above
the quick slap of soles the creak of
blocks and the quiver of the straining
hull no food or water was passed down

all the night and all the day the chase
continued with the cruiser gradually
creeping in his bow-chasers opened
while his colors flew to his main-peak
the shot at first falling astern began to
splash water upon the helmsman a ball
from a long twenty-four ripped through
the bulwarks of the starboard bow-
might as easily have ripped through
either main- or fore-mast
black man and white witch



captain fezarri saw himself about to
be caught with a foul ship that would
never do sheering off from a prize court
and charge of piracy he ordered the chain
cable of the best bower anchor freed of
its hawse-hole and stoppered along out-
side the weather rail and the blacks to
be fetched up

up they came prodded and thwacked
clanking and groaning in their ankle
cuffs up the main-hatch ladder to tum-
ble bewildered into the light of day
there now were scarce one hundred
men women and children

the kings ship appeared to have
picked a favoring slant of air for he
gained more rapidly captain fezarri
while overseeing that the blacks were
leg-ironed in couples and tied by the
wrists to the links of the cable kept a
hopeful eye somewhat reddened of the
conjunctival membrane upon that squall
gathering off the weather beam

if the squall struck the cruiser first
and the cruiser stood on before it the
flower of happiness should be lightened
speedily ere she was hove to for search
if the squall gave her an even break with
the britisher he captain fezarri would
hold on himself and risk all

planted with the others against the for-
ward rail with his left ankle ironed to
the right of a yellow eboe his bruised
wrists bound behind him to the anchor
cable at the end of the line as happened
the huge koromantin stood erect his
battered head was high his gaze was fixed
straight before him as though he were re-
viewing his africa long below the hori-
zon and about him there was something
serious majestic and implacable

he had no wife nor child nor country
the first two had been wrested from him
and done to death by the white man from
the last he himself had been wrested and
now he had only his hate

apparently unseeing nevertheless he
saw the white witch was upon the deck
here she came that creature of evil who
had cast her spells upon them so that they
might die she came forward slipping
and clinging to the rail opposite was it
possible that she too had the sickness in
white she was which was no whiter than
her white-witch face with her was an-
other of the hated tormentors

the koromantin gave no sign that he
noted them perhaps it was this scorn-
ful hardihood--the naked soul exposed
in a great naked savage or perhaps it was
the twilight gloom of the squall impend-
ing amid threat of cannon boom and ball
and the flag of law or perhaps it was the
quick word from the womans parted lips
which impelled the arab cabin-boy with
eyes grotesquely swollen to dart into the
bows to clip the koromantins wrist bond
with his knife and tuck a file into the thick
astonished fingers

while the eyes of master and crew such
as could still serve were turned upon
ship and squall over the quarter stealthily
sinking and here shielded by his fellows
and a corner of the galley the koromantin
worked like mad upon his ankle shackle
the blind eboe beside him was too far
gone with apathy to care

the file bit fiercely like the black mans
fierce spirit but he was granted little time
down swooped the squall charging across
the darkened sea with an onrush of nep-
tunes cavalry whose hoof-beats stir spume
instead of dust so that the murky line of
its advance was clearly defined

it veered for the cruiser and the suck
of it set the guineamans canvas to flap-
ping she lost way while leaning to the
first blast until his yards dipped with his
fore top gallant streaming in ribbons the
cruiser leaped to seize his prize in a min-
ute he was almost within hailing distance


weird tales

-aye the whistle of his bosn could be
heard while his reefers clustered like bees
and the teeth of his broadside plainly
showed and the flower of happiness
hung practically in stays

  cut loose captain fezarris com-
mand sharply issued at last hatchet in
hand a sailor ran for the bows he brushed
past the crouched koromantin and the
hatchet blade fell upon the sea lashings of
the large bower anchor

  hold

  see the fore top gallant yard of the
cruiser was down and dragging from his
rail-he yawed-he lost way the squall
closed over him and was swinging for the
wake of the flor de felicidade as she
filled with the first of the wind

  hold that had been for the man
with the hatchet hard a-weather
this for the man at the helm dius
boys well leave him yet

  -too late in part the hatchet had done
its work down from the cathead dropped
the anchor and with terrible rasp and
clangor the cable followed ripped from
stop after stop and in its deadly flight
plucking with it black after black like
monkeys snared in a forest twitch-up

  the rail was clean in an instant while
yet the flower of happiness was jibing
upon new course she whirled like a hare
and was away and in the welter of the
kings ship just chopped free of his top
gallant wreckage tore over the spot that
his chase had been occupying but anchor
and chain and hapless blacks were fathoms
deep-all except the big koromantin

  that vicious jerk by the anchor which
communicated through the wrist-tethered
eboe had haled him along bodily by the
ankle shackle over the bulwarks and into
air and sea snapped the weakened shackle-
link and thrown wide of the bows as the
slaver jibed he was released

  from two fathoms down he rose half

strangled but fighting into the moil of
spray and gust to be near strangled again
by the rush of the cruiser and then
drowning to clutch by instinct at the top
gallant flotsam and take breath and bear-
ings

  he hung fast waiting and floating the
tropical rain flattened the slight sea kicked
up by the squall squall and rain ushered
on the dusk and the clouds broke from the
moon and stars the koromantin climbed
upon his sodden little isle and greedily
sucked at the rain cupped in the hollows of
the canvas remnants

  refreshed he rode all night in the
sunrise doldrums the ocean lay flawless
heaving with long and languid breath
like the pulsant rhythm of creation not a
sail emerged between him and that low
and distant bluish line which might be
africa nor in that other direction which
concealed the unknown he had only the
sharks and sea-fowl for company

  this was the latitude of seasonal calms
punctuated by hasty squalls he drifted
all the day managed to eke out an exist-
ence during two days and nights and in
the third night the towering brigantine
came down upon him across the silvered
plain

he crouched amid his raft of wreck-
age much as he would have crouched
in a jungle covert of his guinea mountain
homeland he preferred death to the
slave deck again but he was rabid for
food when the portentous thing came
dipping and swaying and creaking and
suddenly uprearing would contemptuously
tread him under he sprang he reached
with his long arms and grasping the bob-
stays he clung for a short space like a
giant ape

  the little jingle that he had made
ceased the top-hamper raft was shunted
aside by his leap and by the wash from
black man and white witch



the crafts cutwater he swarmed higher
and higher foot by foot until chinning
himself upon the bowsprit he craned with
his fuzzy head and peered into the deck

that which he sensed appalled him

the gash through the forward star-
board bulwarks had been partially re-
paired-though only partially but this
sign was not necessary to his enlighten-
ment he smelt he perceived he knew
he was back again upon the slaver flor de
felicidade which to him and the like had
no name save the african blacks name
for hell

the deck white under the moon and
changeful with the shadows of sails and
cordage as the ship weaved and curtsied
with scarce steerage way was muttersome
with figures which prone or sitting other-
wise might have been asleep at the far
end was the figure of the captain motion-
less holding to the wheel as if listening

the koromantin shrank prepared to
drop from his perch in the bows right
before him there rose a sailor who called
about

hello ahoy listen everybody i
heard something dead ahead

the murmurings were stilled the great
black sank lower crouched for retreat
through the tense interval of faculties
alert the captain shouted query from the
wheel the man in the bows replied and
turning looked full with jaws moving and
hand poised at the bowsprit and its cower-
ing shadowed refugee

but the black did not drop instead he
stiffened with nostrils expanded he
hitched higher and wormed onward all in
a fever of desire down the bowsprit the
sailor was turned again as though giving
ear but half face or full face counted the
same now with the black-the eyes had
been swollen shut and besides the koro-
mantin was hungry

from the rail he sprang like a leopard

upon the sailor vaguely questioning of the
ankle-irons faint jingle with knee and
arm snapped his neck even while bearing
him down and had snatched the hunk of
meat crouched was champing upon it
while the alarm of the brief scuffle the
clinking and the fall had pervaded the
deck fore and aft

men leaped up

whats that

whos aboard 

did you hear

hello forward

one stumbled against another and
swore and with an oath the captains
voice belched powerfully

forward there whos the watch
look sharp men that sounded like a
loose black wearing an iron search
along up into the bows some of you
and he called in the mandingo trade dia-
lect of the slave coast who is there
the koromantin made no answer
while he greedily devoured the meat he
fastened his glowing eyes upon another
near enemy who had scrambled up as
though he had been asleep under the rail
here and who was confusedly casting
about the man tripped upon the body
and knelt and explored with his hands
and shouted

sanchez is dead here he is-hes just
been killed dius look out all im com-
ing aft wherewith he went creeping
and groveling as though he dodged a
blow

the effect of the words was pleasing to
the black giant the men before him cried
out and ran about jostling and recoiling
and seizing whatever weapons their fin-
gers encountered they were blind he
stood upright and they did not see him

the meat had been salty the thought
of water mastered him he made a step
his ankle shackle jingled the ship men
cried out again and strained to see he


weird tales

tore the neckerchief from the dead white
man and muffled the ankle cuff and its
dangling link then again as swiftly and
as silently as a leopard he stole to the
scuttle-butt chocked at the foot of the
mainmast and throwing caution to the
winds dipped with the calabash and avid-
ly gulped

from the wheel the captain called
whos drinking look sharp every-
body down on deck with you

and he fired with his pistol the ball
seared the koromantins shoulder the
wanton injury added to other injuries and
to his hate of all these butchers and robbers
and particularly of the chief and his white-
witch woman infuriated him straight on
over the cabin roof he vaulted pounced
upon the wheel and the startled wretch
there clutched the captain by the two ears
and the yellow chops and grinning into
the sightless eyes dragged him from his
hold with the strength of madness twirled
him high and flung him over the gunwale

there was only the half-stifled cry from
the captain before he whisked overboard
and only the plash of his landing after-
ward but these tokens carried to the crew
stunned into immobility by the pistol shot
and the instant slap of bare flat soles and
the pantings of savage energy

dius there goes the captain

wait listen hello captain are you
aboard captain

the koromantin squatting near the
wheel did not reply from the captain
came no reply terror like a cold hand
gripped the brigantine flower of happi-
ness with slat of sail and block creak of
boom and yard she drifted helmless
while stock-still or stealthily shifting as
though fearing to draw attention the crew
murmured among themselves

it must be a black who escaped drown-
ing

yes and he can see he has his eyes

he is aft where he got the captain i
hear him breathing

 saints protea us we are dead men
 somebody speak to him who knows
 guinea talk

 ruez has mandingo where is ruez
 here

 go speak that devil black ruez ask
 him who he is and what he wants

 hell kill me

 maybe not if you speak him civilly
 yes said another tell him we will
 feed him ruez he shall have rum then
 if we can only get at the cabins medicine
 chest we can poison him

 promise him pay in rum for the use
 of his eyes so we can make a port or a sail
 when we wish we will doaor his rum
 with the laudanum and tie him up

 the squatted black saw a sailor coming
 on feeling along the rail and he rose
 picked a belaying-pin from the near rail
 and waited he was going to kill all in
 due time

 the sailor called in the mandingo trade
 jargon brother hello

 this was not worth response as the
 sailor paused redly swollen of the eyes in
 the moonlight at the farther corner of the
 cabin the koromantin recognized in those
 distorted features the countenance of the
 half-caste cabin-boy who had cut his bonds

 hello who is it eboe fullah man-
 dingo

 the african growled with one word
 koromantin

 a shudder and a wail swept the waist
 of the flower of happiness

 koromantin hear you he is a sav-
 age a pagan we are dead men

 the cabin-boy piped again what do
 you want friend

 the black gave no answer

 food drink you shall have plenty
 who are you you are the big man you
 have eyes
black man and white witch



 said the koromantin i am death
 the boy retreated

 he is the big koromantin i offered
 him food and drink but he means to kill
 us

 could you see him ruez

 very little

 maybe enough to shoot him

 oh no not enough yet

 the white men jabbered then fetch
 him food and rum quick

 promise him we will make him rich
 toll him forward till we can get the
 laudanum out of the cabin

 once he is put asleep we can tie him
 in irons and promise him his freedom
 for his eyes in that way we can make a
 port

 then he shall be strung up for mur-
 dering the captain and sanchez

 yes but in the name of god first treat
 with him quick ruez speak him fair
 again get him forward

 the koromantin grimly smiled at the
 panic a slight jar of impact registered
 upon the ships counter he looked over
 and he saw a canoe-the small-boat in-
 deed-floating there with slack tether

 but here again came the boy from for-
 ward with a dish of food and set it upon
 the roof of the cabin he dipped into the
 -cask of water and clumsily filled up a tin
 cup from which wafted the odor of rum

 eat and drink friend he called
 you will find he said plenty more
 food in that little house up ahead pretty
 soon more rum too eat drink sleep
 make ready to show us the way to other
 white people so that you shall go back
 home rich

 the black with eyes and nostrils
 titillated straightened more erect to
 take crafty step he would eat drink and
 kill-but not kill all these in the night and

 by violating his fetish invest his path with
 ghosts

 he stopped short before his very face
 up out of the stairway from the cabin she
 came the white witch the captains
 woman like a spirit came emerging
 silently into the moonlight in bare feet
 in thin white gown with her hands grop-
 ing her countenance upturned to him and
 sightless

 he stood transfixed breathing rapidly
 while his broad naked chest rose and fell
 his fingers spread his sinews tautened
 his veins swelled upon the top step she
 paused as if questing she spoke from
 parted lips

 pedro are you here what hap-
 pens i heard a noise

 forward a babble broke afresh

 it is the senhora

 beware senhora back down no
 no this way to us there is a black

 she uttered a frightened little cry she
 wavered-and the big koromantin leaped
 lust surged within him as he seized upon
 her crushing her in his two arms lifting
 her bodily and bearing her to the stern
 rail

 her flesh was soft in his grip her loos-
 ened hair brushed his face and all his brute
 senses thrilled to the gift of her

 down he flung her like a lion deposit-
 ing his spoil she had gasped and shivered
 she lay lax disheveled she had fainted
 she was defenseless to his will

 there had been a moment of silence
 but the white men roused

 he has the senhora at him to the
 rescue

 with loud shouts they wildly shambled
 up the deck he vented a tremendous yell
 and stamped and clattered with his pin
 and in a frenzy of helplessness they ran
 about and blundered and fought one an-
 other darting from spot to spot he threat-
 ened them until they cowered with their


weird tales

 tongues out in a fear as though the

flower of happiness were possessed by a
demon

having demonstrated over the blind
fools he left them to their prayers and
curses and returned to his woman while
he stood over her his fingers twitched
clasping and unclasping his large face
worked convulsively-he licked his lips
she this white-witch girl whom he did
not fear was his to do with as he pleased
but he need not hurry he could picture
and gloat and plan

he snapped a rope and bound her
wrists behind her tied her by the slim
waist to a stanchion and settled with cup
and dish to drink eat and wait

voices besought senhora are you
there senhora

mother of god senhora treat with
him play him kindly do not anger him
senhora it is the big koromantin-the
proud one you noticed pretend to be good
to him senhora fetch him rum from the
cabin you will put laudanum in it when
he is asleep we will take him and truss
him

the black secure upon his quarter-
deck let them gabble for this brief truce
he glowered and deliberated the right
to kill was his and the lust to kill was his
the white murderers-there they were
at his disposal as if by favor of his fetish
his fingers tightened upon the belaying-
pin and in fancy it crushed into those
skulls in fancy too he threw them all
over into the water-threw them blind
to join the blind devil captain and the
blind and shackled black men and women
thrown over before

and then the woman she should go
with him to land when he knew where
land was for his further pleasure she
should be his jungle toy until he was done
with her he licked his lips

the white men had promised him
riches although he was black and they

were white although he had been a slave
and they were free although he was
naked and they were clothed it should
easily be believed that since he had eyes
and they did not they would make him
rich if he helped them

it might be supposed that he had that
to think upon but vengeance for what
had been visited upon him and his rela-
tives and his kind lay virtually under his
feet and none should tell of it for the
sea like the jungle was deep

the slaver swinging in the airs and
currents yawing upon erratic course
drifted on through a low haze which like
a sheeny halo enclosed but nowhere
touched her the canvas hung damp every
point dangled limply and from spars and
beaded rigging the moisture dripped
dripped with the languored slowness of
the tropics

the babblings forward were fitful the
woman lay motionless quiet doused the
spasms of the exhausted brigantine and
the black content dozed but with animal
senses alert

     hen he wakened by intuitive warn-
ing the moon was red in the hori-
zon and its flooding light had been dulled
by the grayish pallor of first daybreak
the deck was somnolent with figures
postured inertly as if drugged by the heavy
breath of dawn the woman had not
stirred gently rocked by the flower of
happiness that heaved to and fro upon
the smoothly heaving water

the air around had cleared and to the
koromantins quick ear was permeated
with the booming as of a far far african
drum

he looked and he saw yonder a white
bank-the bank of a fog suspended above
the surface of the world and beneath it a
white line frothed and simmered the line
of that surf which boomed forever like an
black man and white witch



endless requiem upon the bars and
beaches and buttress cliffs of africa

the fluent fog opened and closed for
intervals of deeper vistas upon a broad
low point apparently quite near dark
fronds of coco-palms sentineled a dense
jungle of darker mangroves massed in il-
limitable review while the brigantine im-
pelled by a fateful current idly drifted
past there were hints of a mighty in-
ward curving coastline and shattered by a
headland in the remotest south the eddy-
ing fleecy billows gave errant glimpses of a
bay where white-man craft clustered before
a sprawling thatch-roofed village

the time had come if he showed the
people of this ship whereabouts those
other white people were they would make
him rich the boy had so said in feeding
him had promised him more food and
rum but here they were his enemies
here was the white-witch woman his
woman and there was the land his lips
curled

with pin in hand he slipped forward
noiseless and resolute he stood poised
over the first of the crew asleep with face
in arms and body in shadow whereupon
as if vaguely moved by the formidable
presence the sleeper sighed and turned
and beneath the raised club the black
gazed down upon the blank countenance
of the cabin-boy

the club lingered and drooped again
he remembered here was one whom he
could not strike irresolution tugged at
him while he hesitated the swiftly
broadening pink of the african dawn
shone upon the top canvas of a ship dis-
tant out at sea but standing in as though it
brought a breeze

he yet had time abruptly stooping he
whipped the knife from the boys sash
he ran back to his woman cut her waist
tether and greedily lifted her she wak-

ened she writhed she was as a child in his
clutch

  who is it

  koromantin

  she might know but she should never
tell her white soft form was pressed
close to his black chest and his blood
flowed hotly his eyes sought the cabin
he started he faltered  he felt her
heart beating like a frightened birds and
through the pounding in his ears he
caught her implorations choked with
anguish

  no no oh dius he did not die
and he would harm me who set him free
holy angels help me let me give him
the rum

  with a harsh cry he held her off and
slashed her wrist bond and roughly
dashed her to the deck in a bound he
leaned over the quarter drew the floating
boat underneath him cut that rope and
hanging from the taffrail dropped in

  he shoved away then he uttered a high
yell and he heard again those responsive
notes of terror from the white men the
craven bletherings of those white dogs
who had murdered his family friends and
fellows and were connived together to lie
him into dependence upon their grati-
tude-even to poison him through the oily
words of the boy and the deceit of the
woman who once had succored him
forthwith he called up in fair portuguese

  good-bye you have on one side
land on other side comes kings ship
maybe your fetish save you you say you
make me rich now i am rich for i take
my life in trade for your life go you
stinking murderers and liars

  thus dismissing them the big black
man one-time court linguist to the daho-
man king who had sold him paddled for
that african shore where the mangrove
jungle grew almost to the very surf
  hill drums

by henry s whitehead

the weird power of a song-how the blacks of the danish west
indies harried a british consul-general

when mr william palgrave brit-
ish consul-general at st thomas
danish west indies stepped out
of his fine residence on denmark hill
he looked as one local wit had unkindly
remarked like an entire procession
it could not be denied that handsome
mr palgrave diplomat famed author of
travel articles in the leading british mag-
azines made at all times a vastly impos-
ing appearance and that of this appear-
ance he was entirely conscious

   one blazing afternoon in may in the
year of grace  he came statelily
down the steps before his house toward
his open carriage waiting in the roadway
below on the box claude his negro
coachman sagged down now under the
broiling sun conversed languidly with
one la touche penn a street loafer
whose swart skin showed through various
rents in a faded many-times-washed blue
dungaree shirt seeing the consul-gen-
eral descending claude straightened him-
self abruptly while la touche penn
slouched away the white of an observant
rolled eye on mr palgrave

   as this neer-do-well strolled noncha-
lantly down the hill-the hard soles of a
pair of feet which had never known the
constriction of shoes making sandpaper-
like sounds on the steep roadway-he
whistled softly a nearly soundless little
tune claude tightened his reins and the
small grass-fed somnolent carriage-
horses plucked up weary heads ending
their nap in the drowsy air that was
how mr palgrave liked to find his ap-

pointments-in order ready for their
functions mr palgrave-so another st
thomas wit-was not unlike the late
general braddock whose fame is in the
american histories in short a bureau-
cratic martinet whose wide travels soon
to bring him greater fame as the distin-
guished author of ulysses had failed
signally to modify a native phlegmatic
bluntness

  he came down the steps a resplendent
figure of a fine gentleman dressed with
a precise meticulousness in the exact mode
of the london fashion and glancing
after the furtive wastrel now well down
the hill road he caught the whistled tune
as he recognized it he frowned heavily
pursing his lips into a kind of pout which
went ill with his appearance of portly
well-nourished grandeur this accom-
plished diplomat was fastidious easily
annoyed not to put too fine a point
upon it he did not like st thomas

  for one thing he disliked feminine
names for places and the capital town in
those days was called charlotte amalia
after one of denmarks queens it was
a coquette of a town a slender brunette
of black eyes and very red lips and cheeks
a latin brunette of the smoldering gar-
ish type a brunette who ran to mantillas
and coquetteries and very high heels on
her glistening slippers

  various times had mr palgrave in his
blunt manner compared to charlottes
disadvantage her alleged beauties with the
sedate solidity of his last post trebizond
in armenia whence he had come here to
the caribbean at first these animadver-
hill drums



sions of his had been lightly received
charlotte amalia was a tolerant lass
this was perhaps only a strange variety
of british banter society had let it go
at that would probably have forgotten all
about it but then the consul-general
had made it plain several times that he
had meant quite literally exactly what he
had said at that charlotte though still
tolerantly had been annoyed

finally he had been-unconsciously
charlotte granted that quite definitely-
offensive he had said certain things
used certain terms which were-inadvis-
able the way he used the word na-
tive society agreed was bad diplomacy
to put it mildly society continued be-
cause he was a caucasian and because of
his official position to invite him to its
dinners its routs its afternoon teas its
swizzel parties government house took
no notice of his ineptitudes his compari-
sons

the british families and there were
many of these permanently resident in
st thomas-chatfields talbots robert-
sons macdesmonds-were of course
the backbone of his social relationships
some of them tried to give him hints
when they saw how the wind was veering
against him and wishing their own diplo-
matic representative to be clear of criti-
cism but these well-intentioned efforts
slipped off mr palgraves uncompromis-
ing broad back like water from a ducks

then he had really put his foot in it
the leading english magazine to which
he was a valued contributor brought out
an article by him-on charlotte amalia
here the already famous author of travel
articles had commented in cold print and
disparagingly upon the society of which
he was for the time being an integral
part he had too been so injudicious
as to compare charlotte amalia with
trebizond vastly to the advantage of the


weird tales

armenian capital trebizond if the man
had any sentiment in him must at that
period have seemed very attractive in
retrospect

it was chiefly the british west indians
who took in the magazine but there were
a few others the news of the article
spread like wildfire extra copies at
lightbourns store were quickly exhaust-
ed other copies were ordered extant
copies were worn dog-eared from fre-
quent readings of that faux pas it fin-
ished mr palgrave in charlotte amalia

a consul-general and of great britain
can hardly be ignored in a comparatively
small community nevertheless char-
lotte amalia now drew in her perfumed
skirts in no unmistakable gesture there
was of course nothing overt about this
gesture charlotte was far too subtle far
too polite and sophisticated after the con-
tinental manner for anything crude any-
thing that is smacking of the consul-
generals own methods but there was
an immediate difference a delicate sub-
tle difference which as the weeks pro-
gressed was to make its impact upon the
consciousness of william palgrave
through his thick mental epidermis in a
very strange manner indeed

for it had penetrated elsewhere than
to the very outer edges of st thomas
society it had got down to black qua-
shee himself down through the various
intervening social strata-minor officials
a few professional persons shopkeepers
artizans-down to quashee in his tattered
shirt shoeless carefree quashee at the
very bottom of charlotte amalias social
scheme

early that spring at the time when
house servants become mysteriously
ill and have to be relieved of their duties
for a few days and the rata drums
fader mama and boula de babee may

be heard to roll and boom nightly from
the wooded hills in the islands interior
and the trade winds changing direction
leaves an almost palpable curtain of sul-
triness hanging over the hot dry town on
its three hillsides in those days when the
burros tongues hang out of dry mouths
along dusty roads and the centipedes
come into the houses out of the dust and
street dogs slink along blazing sidewalks
in the narrow slits of house-shade under
the broiling sun of late may-time -
then as the black people came trick-
ling back into the town from their
three or four-day sojourn in the hills
when they make the spring songs-then
it was that the honorable william pal-
grave began to be conscious of a vague
partly realized annoyance an annoyance
which seemed to hang in the air all about
him   

  as he lay on his handsome carved ma-
hogany bedstead during an early-after-
noon siesta as he sat in his cool shaded
office before his great desk with its dis-
patch-boxes in orderly rows as he dressed
for dinner after his late-afternoon bath-
taken in the tin tub which he had lugged
about the diplomatic world for the past
eighteen years-at such times the new
annoyance would drift to him in whispers
on the dull wings of the sultry air so hard
to breathe for one of his portly habit

  it was a sound-annoyance a vague
thin almost imperceptible thing it was
a tune with certain elusive words words
of which he heard recurrent bits snatches
snippets incidental mere light touches of
a delicate withering sarcasm-directed
toward him as a child might blow thistle-
down with faint derisive intent in the di-
rection of somebody who has managed
to incur its dislike

  the st thomas negroes so it became
borne in upon mr palgraves under-
standing had made a song on him
hill drums



  it was a characteristic quickstep kind
of song something in the nature of a
folksong of these there are various ex-
amples like the one wherein the more
urban st thomian makes fun of his
santa crucian neighbor by alleging that
de crucian gyurl don wash dey skin
md which ends on the rollicking chorus
wash yoself in a sardine-tin

  in the course of the weeks in which he
was obliged to listen to it mr palgrave
came to recognize the tune and even a
few of the words which because of
almost incessant repetition had been
forced though with a delicacy that was
almost eery upon his attention the tune
went to the lilt of the small drum-boula
de babee-somewhat as follows

  the words of which there were many
resolved themselves so far as his appre-
ciation of them was concerned into two
first lines and a refrain thus

  weelum palgrave is a cha-cha bla-hoo

  him are a koind of a half-a-jew

  then the refrain

  him go back to trebizond

  there were in these apparently mother
goose words various hidden meanings
bla-hoo a contraction from bally-
hoo is the name of a small hard-fleshed
surface-water fish not unlike the flying-
fish in consistency and living like its
winged neighbor on the surface of deeps
as used in the verses it intensified cha-
cha a cha-cha-so-called it is cur-
rently believed in st thomas because of
the peculiar sneezing nasality with which
these french poor-whites enunciate their
norman french-is one of a peculiarly

st thomian community originally emi-
gres from st bartholomews now so
thoroughly inbred as to look all alike-
brave and hardy fishermen who can not
swim west indian poor-whites of the
lowest class like the barbadian red-
legs a cha-cha bla-hoo means a par-
ticularly cha-chaish cha-cha an in-
dubitable cha-cha the application of
such a term to the consul-general meant
that he was of the lowest sort of humanity
the st thomian negro could name

  being half-a-jew did not at all mean
that mr palgrave partook as the hearer
might easily imagine of any character-
istics believed to inhere in the co-religion-
ists of moses and aaron the phrase had
a far deeper-and lower-significance
than that the significant portion of it
was that word half that stated plain-
ly meant an aspersion upon the legitimacy
of mr palgraves birth it was that epi-
thet essentially a tu quoque type of in-
sult-youre another it referred directly
to one of mr palgraves mordant asper-
sions upon the quality of the st thom-
ians or rather upon the class the
negroes which was now retaliating it
was not the usual custom of these negroes
to marry it had not been their custom in
africa their danish overlords did not
compel it here why should this for-
eigner this bukra of the double-chin
cast his aspersions upon them how was
he concerned not at all was black
quashees obvious reply according to the
logic of the situation his equally obvious
retort to drum-beats was

him are a koind of a half-a-jew

  but-the real gist of the retort com-
pared to which these glancing blows at
his self-esteem were mere thrusts of the
banderillo goads-was the refrain

him go back to trebizond

  it was not precisely a command it
was still less a statement of accomplished


weird tales

fact mr paigrave had not gone back to
his esteemed armenian post mr pal-
grave had no intention whatever of ap-
plying to downing street for a transfer
back there it was-a suggestion

it was that refrain which la touche
penn had been whistling as he walked
demurely away down the glaring white
road under the blazing sunlight mr
paigrave stared angrily after the slouch-
ing figure stared after it an uncompro-
mising scowl upon his handsome florid
features until it disappeared abruptly
around a sudden turn half-way down the
hill then he mounted the step of his
barouche and settled himself in the exact
center of the sun-heated leather cushion
a linen dust-cloth over his knees

it was a tuesday afternoon and later
at five oclock it was mr palgraves
intention to call at government house
governor arendrup was receiving that
afternoon as he did once a month but
between now and then there was an inter-
val of an hour and a half which the con-
sul-general meant to spend in making
duty calls

claude very erect drove carefully
down the hill turned the sharp corner
around which la touche penn had dis-
appeared and thence by a devious route
descended the slight slope leading to the
chief thoroughfare along the seas edge
here he turned to the left passed that
massive structure the grand hotel driv-
ing between it and emancipation park
turned once more to the left and soon
the wiry little carriage horses were sweat-
ing up one of charlotte amalias steepest
hills they moved carefully around hair-
breadth turns guarded by huge clumps of
cacti and at last emerged near the summit
of government hill claude stopped
before the entrance to a massive residence
perched atop a still higher rise in the land

  mr paigrave climbed steps to the stone
and cement terrace of this house and
gave to the expressionless black butler his
card for mrs talbot the servant took
his stick and hat and led the way up a
flight of stairs to mrs talbots drawing-
room as the consul-general mounted
behind his ebony guide he became aware
of a tap-tapping a light sound as though
made by the fingers of a supple hand on
a kitchen pan the tapping went oom
-bom bom oom-bom bom oom-
bom bom over and over monotonously
accompanying this beat was a light
almost a childish voice one of the black
maids probably in some distant portion
of the great house the tune was the
tune la touche penn had been whistling
as he slouched down the hill mr pai-
grave mentally supplied the words

  weelum paigrave is a cha-cha bla-hoo

  him are a koind of a half-a-jew-

  him go back to trebizond

  it was maddening this sort of thing
it should not be allowed here in mrs
talbots house a choleric red disfigured
mr palgraves handsome face as he
walked into the drawing-room it took
him several minutes to reassume his ac-
customed urbanity   

  something mrs talbot said too was
annoying

  i am sure i can not say where i ac-
quired the idea mr paigrave but-
somehow-it came to me that you were
not remaining with us that you were
expecting to go back to armenia was it
not

  i have no such intention-i assure
you mr paigrave felt himself suddenly
pink in the face he used his handker-
chief may in this climate is very warm
mrs talbot hoped he would not mind the
summer heat

  we find the sea bathing refreshing
she had vouchsafed

hill drums



mr palgrave did not outstay the
twenty-minute minimum for a duty call
as he descended the broad stairway he
heard the tap-tapping once more but now
the words accompanying it were muted
there was no song he found himself
repeating the doggerel words to the tap-
ping of that damnable pan

him go back to trebizond

absurd he should do nothing of the
sort only fancy-blackamoors to sug-
gest such a thing-to him he descended
the steps to the roadway a picture of com-
placent dignity

a tiny barefooted black child strolled
past an empty kerosene-tin balanced on
her kinky kerchiefed head the child
preoccupied with a wilted bougainvillea
blossom which she held between her
hands hummed softly a mere tuneless
little murmur barely audible on the fresh-
ening trade wind of midafternoon mr
palgrave his perceptions singularly sensi-
tive diis afternoon caught it however
his directions for the next call were given
to black claude almost savagely

precisely at live he mounted the steps
of government house he was
saluted in form by the pair of danish
gendarmes in their stiff frederick the
great uniforms from each side of the
doorway he subscribed his name and
titles in the visitors book he gave up his
hat and stick to another saluting gen-
darme and mounted the interior stairway
to the great drawing-room above

    here all st thomas society congre-
gated monthly at the governors reception
and with those who had arrived on time
this afternoon die drawing-room was half
filled the governors band outside on
the east end of the iron gallery which
runs along the front of government
house started up an air officers offi-
w t-

cials the clergy the towns gentry the
other resident consuls and the ladyfolk
of all these passed solemnly in review
before the governor stiff in his black
clothes shaking hands formally in his
box-like frock coat his spotless white kid
gloves

  mr palgrave still ruffled from his
afternoons experiences greeted his dan-
ish majestys representative in this loyal
colony with a stiffness quite equal to the
governors and passed within ladies
seated at both ends of a vast mahogany
table in the dining-room dispensed coffee
and tea mounded along the tables sides
stood great silver trays of spread
half-sandwiches of white and brown
bread covered with cheese with preserves
with ground meats with liver-pastei at
the sideboard santa cruz rum made in
the colony french brandy imported from
martinique and danish beer in small
bottles and served with fine pieces of ice
in the glasses were being rapidly dis-
pensed by liveried negro servants to a
crowd which stood eight deep

  from this group a burly figure that of
captain the honorable william mcmil-
lin detached itself and accosted mr pal-
grave the captain administrator of
great fountain estate over on santa cruz
here for the day on some estate business
for his kinsmen the comyns family who
all lived in scotland and for whom he
managed their santa crucian sugar inter-
ests had been as a freshly commissioned
cornet of horse one of wellingtons offi-
cers more than fifty years before at
waterloo the old gentleman invited
mr palgrave to a bottle of the carlsburg
beer and the two britons provided with
this refreshing beverage sat down to talk
together

  in their armchairs the two made a
notable appearance both being large-
bodied florid men and the aged captain


weird tales

wearing as was his custom on state occa-
sions his ancient scarlet military coat
outside the great open french windows
the band members on the gallery between
pieces made themselves heard as they ar-
ranged their music save for the band-
master erasmus petersen a dane all
were negroes through the windows
came minor musical sounds as a slide was
shifted in an alto horn or as little runs
and flutings tested the precision of a new
tuning in the midst of this delicately
almost incidentally the oboist ran his
swart fingers over his silver keys breathed
into his instrument a rippling muted
little quickstep came through the win-
dows

  weelum palgrave is a cha-cha bla-hoo

  mr palgrave suddenly shifted in his
armchair then he remembered that he
could not appear to notice this deliberate
slap in the face and though suddenly
empurpled he sat quiet he collected his
wits invited the captain to dinner that
evening and excused himself

  claude attentive for once noted his
emergence below extricated his barouche
reached the steps where the two wooden-
soldierlike gendarmes were saluting his
master

  home said mr palgrave acidly
stepping into the carriage

that evening mr palgrave opened
his grief to his fellow briton as to a
person of assured position and integrity
the consul-generals face quite purple
between his vexation and the bottle of
sound burgundy he had consumed at
dinner

  the captain took his consul-generals
annoyance lightly

  man man he expostulated yere
no so clearly accustomed to quashee and
his ways as mysel i do assure you why

-theres a song about me my field-
hands made it up years ago it runs

mars mcmillin la fb me

loike him la to waterloo

  and it means that i command them-
that is to la mr palgrave-the same as
i gave commands at waterloo-there
were a-precious few i do assure you sir
i was no more than a comet at the time
my commission not two weeks old the
captain proceeded to pooh-pooh the
quashee songs as reason for serious an-
noyance

  but his explanations left mr palgrave
cold

  your negroes do not-er-insist upon
your returning to the low countries to
fight waterloo all over again was his
bitter comment that suggestion that he
return to trebizond had bitten deep   

  he had trebizond on his mind when
he was retiring that night and it is not
strange that he went back there where he
had spent two profitable years before
being assigned to charlotte amalia in his
dreams somehow as the strange distor-
tion of the dream-state provides he was
identified with the sage firdusi a great
hero of armenian legend that same
firdusi who had defied a shah of persia
and refused to compose a history of his
life at the imperial command

  identified with firdusi of whom he
had heard many tales mr palgrave
suffered imprisonment in his dreams was
like firdusi summoned again and again
into the presence always with refusal
on his lips always to be sent back to a
place of confinement of increasing com-
fortlessness

  at last palgrave-firdusi returned to an
empty cell where for days he sat on the
earthen floor refusing to yield to stultify
himself then on a gray morning his
jailer entered leading a blind slobbering
negro who sat on the floor opposite him
hill drums



for an interminable period he suffered
this disagreeable companionship the
black was dumb as well as blind he sat
there day after day night after night
cross-legged on the hard floor

at last palgrave-firdusi could stand it
no longer he howled for his jailer de-
manded audience he was led to the
throne room his resolution dissipated his
one overwhelming desire to acquiesce-
yes yes he would write-only let him be
free of that slobbering horror which
mewed to itself with its blank slab of a
mouth he threw himself face down be-
fore the throne   

the impact of his prostration awakened
him shivering in his great mahogany
bed the moonlight of the caribees
poured through the opened jalousies of
the airy bedroom high on the hillsides of
charlotte amalia and through the open
windows came eerily-it was three oclock
in the morning-the very ghost of a little
lilting refrain in the cracked voice of
some aged man

him go back-to trebizond

mr paigrave groaned rolled over in
bed so that his better ear was undermost
sought to woo sleep again

but now it was impossible to sleep
that time-that devilish that damnable
tune - was running through his head
again tumultuously to the small-drum
throbbing of his heart he groaned and
tossed impatiently miserably would
morning never come

in a gray dawn mr paigrave rose from
an unrefreshing bed tubbed himself
half-heartedly his face as he looked at
it in his shaving-mirror wielding his
wednesday wade  butcher seemed gray
and drawn there was no color in his usu-
ally choleric cheeks the servants at this
hour would not have arrived there would
be no morning tea ready

  at a little before seven fully dressed
mr paigrave descended the staircase to
his office below he sat down at his order-
ly desk listening to the shuffle of early-
morning bare feet outside there on the
earthen hillside roadway before his fine
house to the clipped grave snatches of the
creole speech of the blacks to the occa-
sional guffaws of the negroes about their
early-morning occasions gravely erect
carrying trays fruits great tins of cistern-
water atop kerchiefed heads

  mechanically he reached for his writ-
ing-materials dipped a pen in an inkwell
commenced to write he wrote on and on
composing carefully the edge of his mind
engaged in listening for the song out
there on the roadway he discovered that
he was tapping out its cadence with his
foot on the scrubbed pitch-pine flooring
underneath his desk oom-bom bom
oom - bom bom oom - bom bom
oom-bom bom

  he finished his letter signed it metic-
ulously blotted it folded it twice then
heard the latch of the remote kitchen door
snap he rose walked into the dining-
room and spoke through the inner kitchen
door to melissa his cook who had just ar-
rived

  make me some tea at once if you
please

  yes sar it was the dutiful monoto-
nous unhurried voice of old black me-
lissa as she motivated herself ponderously
in the direction of the charcoal barrel in
the kitchens corner

  mr paigrave reflectively mounted the
stairs to his bedroom he was putting a
keen edge on his wednesday razor-he
used a set of seven-before it dawned
upon him that he had already shaved he
returned the razor to its case what could
be the matter with him he looked mus-
ingly into his shaving-mirror passed a
well-kept hand reflectively over the


weird tales

smooth cheeks into which the exercise of
moving about and up and down the stairs
had driven a little of his accustomed high
color he shook his head at his reflection
in the glass walked out into the upper
hallway redescended the stairs once more
entered his office

what was this

he frowned stared picked up from
the desk the letter he had finished ten min-
utes before examined it carefully it was
unquestionably in his own handwriting
the ink was barely dry he laid it back in
its place on the desk and began to pace
the room slowly listening to melissas
slow movings-about in the kitchen to the
arrival of other servants he could hear
their clipped greetings to the old cook

wondering at himself at this strange
mental world where he found himself he
seated himself firmly judicially in his
ample desk chair picked up the letter
read it through again with an ever-increas-
ing wonderment he laid it down his
thoughts turning strangely to trebizond

and mr palgrave could not for the life
of him recall writing this letter

he was still sitting there staring
blankly at nothing his brows drawn to-
gether in a deep frown when claude came
in to announce tea prepared in the dining-
room tea in st thomas continental
fashion is the name of the morning meal
breakfast comes at one oclock mr
palgraves cook had prepared amply that
morning but not bacon and eggs nor even
scotch marmalade availed to arouse
him from his strange preoccupation

after tea he sat again at his desk
alone until ten oclock when his privacy
was invaded by two sailors from a british
vessel in the harbor with consular busi-
ness to transact he gave these men his
careful attention later his advice he
walked out with them an hour later turned

up the hill and strolled about the steep
hillside streets for an hour

  it was nearly high noon when he re-
turned he passed the office going up-
stairs to refresh his appearance after his
walk it was blistering hot outdoors under
the may noon sunlight drenching the dusty
roadways

  when he went into his office half an
hour later he saw the letter once more it
was enclosed now in an official envelope
addressed too in his own unmistakable
handwriting duly stamped for posting
again he had no slightest recollection of
having done any of these things he picked
up the letter intending now to tear
it across and then across again and fling
the bits of paper into the waste-basket in-
stead he sat with it in his hands curiously
placid in an apathetic state in which he
seemed not even to think he ended by
placing it in his coat pocket and jvas im-
mediately afterward summoned to the one
oclock breakfast in the dining-room

     hen he awakened from his siesta
that afternoon it was near four
oclock he remembered the letter at
once he rose and before his afternoon
bath examined the coat pocket the letter
was not in the pocket he decided to look
for it on the desk later

  in half an hour fresh and cool now
after his bath he descended the stairway
and went straight into his office the let-
ter was on his mind and frowning slight-
ly he stepped toward the immaculately
neat desk he drew down his lip under
his teeth in a puzzled expression the let-
ter was not on the desk

  the arrival of callers summoned him
into the drawing-room he did not give
any thought to the letter again until din-
ner-time and then he was at the top of
government hill at one of the british
hill drums



houses and could only postpone his desire
to find and destroy it

the letter failed to turn up and the
next day came and passed and the next
after it and the days stretched into weeks
he had almost forgotten the letter it
cropped up mentally now and then as a
vague half-remembered annoyance
things were going better these days the
song and its varied accompaniments of
drum-tapping whistling humming of the
nearly soundless tune the encompassing
annoyance it had caused him-all these
things seemed to have dropped out of the
hearing and consequently out of the mind
of the consul-general he felt as he half
realized somewhat more at home now in
charlotte amalia everybody it appeared
was perfectly courteous to him the at-
mosphere of vague hostility which had
vaguely adumbrated his surroundings was
gone utterly dissipated the charm of the
town had begun to appeal to this sophis-
ticated traveler of the earths surfaces

then one morning among the letters
which the royal mail steamer hyperion
had brought into the harbor the night be-
fore he discerned an official communica-
tion from his superiors in london

he opened it before any of his other
letters as was natural   

the under-secretary had written grant-
ing his urgent request to be sent back to
trebizond he was requested to take im-
mediate passage to any convenient medi-
terranean port and to proceed thence di-
rect to the armenian capital it was at
the moment agreeable to the consular
service that he should be there sugges-
tions followed in the letters text desig-
nating various policies to be pursued

he finished the many sheets of thin
onion-skin paper folded the letter and
laid it on the desk and sat staring dully
at his inkwell he did not want to go
back to trebizond he wanted to remain

here but-he had no choice in the mat-
ter he cudgeled his brains warily he
recalled his singular apathy at the time
when his letter-written it seemed as
though subconsciously-had disappeared
he had not wanted to write that letter
he recalled that there had been confusion
in his mind at the time-he could not he
recalled remember the actual writing
nor sending it after it was written there
was something very strange here some-
thing- unusual indubitably he had
applied for transfer to trebizond to
trebizond he was ordered to go

  charlotte amalia that coy latin-
brunette of a town with her coquetteries
and her too-garish coloring and her deli-
cate beauties-charlotte amalia had
schemed for his departure forced his
hand driven him out he sat there at
his desk thinking ruefully of many
things then his pride came to his res-
cue he remembered the slights which
had been put upon him those intangible
slights-the almost formless little tune
with its absurd gibberish words the tap-
ping of pans the rattle and boom of the
hill drums those detestable night drums
on which these stupid-looking subtle
blackamoors were always and forever and
compellingly tapping tapping tapping

  and before very long mr palgrave
who did not believe in magic and who
pooh-poohed anything labeled eery or
occult as absurd who believed only in
unmistakable matters like sound beef and
county families and exercise and the in-
tegrity of the british empire and the in-
variable inferiority of foreigners-mr
palgrave came to see that in some fashion
not accounted for in his philosophy char-
lotte amalia had played him a very
scurvy trick-somehow

  bestirring himself he began to exam-
ine the inventory which he kept of his
household gear many belongings without


weird tales

which no british gentleman could be ex-
pected to exist he indited to the har-
bor-master a cold polite note requesting
notice of the arrival of vessels clearing for
mediterranean ports or ports on the black
sea-odessa for choice-and he began to
formulate in his small precise handwrit-
ing the list of duty-calls which must be
made before his departure in the pauses
between these labors he wrote various po-
lite stiff notes and in the very midst of
such activities claude summoned him to
midday breakfast

  leading the way to the dining-room
after this announcement claude paused
at the office doorway turned a deprecat-
ing face to his employer

  yes said mr paigrave perceiving
that claude wished to address him

   yo is leave us sar said claude with
courteous absence of any inflection or em-
phasis on his words which would indicate
that he was asking a question

  yes-i am leaving very shortly re-

plied mr paigrave unemotionally he
added nothing to this statement he was
a stiff master to his servants just but dis-
tant servants had their place and must
be kept in it according to mr palgraves
scheme of life

that night his sleep being rather fit-
ful mr paigrave noted that the drums
were reiterating some message insistently
up in the hills   

neither claude who as coachman-
butler had the closest contact with his em-
ployer of any of the house servants nor
indeed old melissa nor any of the others
made any further remark to their em-
ployer concerning his departure this
took place three days later on a nether-
lands vessel clearing for genoa and mr
paigrave was probably the very last per-
son in st thomas who would have asked
any personal question of a servant

yet he wondered when it occurred to
him-and that was often-just how
claude had known he was leaving   

the blood
veins of the robot

  by l harper allen

     a grim story of a miser whose mechanical man was fed by
     a stream of golden coins

aram mandraga was wizened
withered and old when he came
 alone from armenia and settled
down in a little shop just off sutton place
the place was dingy and dark but
stocked with rugs pile upon pile precious
weaves of ispahan tabriz aragh ka-

shan hamadan kerman sarouk to the
fastidious few it soon became known
discriminating buyers experienced deal-
ers and decorators-and aram mandraga
prospered

aram mandraga had a god also he
revelled in a certain form of music a
the blood veins of the robot	

never-failing symphony which solaced his
soul his god was money-his music
the metallic clink of minted coins

  always as he walked mandraga
would thrust his hands into his pockets
and run his trembling fingers among the

many coins he carried it was joy to his
spirit to hear them clink together his
eyes would brighten his step would
quicken and over his seared face would
creep a smile but it was a smile that
chilled-the smile of a miser he never


weird tales

did this within the hearing of any one
but himself mandraga was selfish of his
music and besides it was pleasant to him
to appear to be poor-it seemed to aid
him in his business and afforded him no
doubt protection against robbery and
against prying eyes

the covering was worn from the but-
tons on his coat the cloth upon his
elbows was thin and polished with long
service he feigned poverty so assiduous-
ly that he scarcely bought food sufficient
to sustain him and therefore he some-
times went hungry strangers who passed
him on the street often thought of him as
a beggar and that pleased him consider-
ably for if the world believed him poor
the world would not rob him an odd
character was aram mandraga

if one had been sufficiently interested
to have investigated he would have been
exceedingly surprized to discover that
aram mandraga had purchased the prop-
erty in which he dwelt and carried on his
business a mortgage had been fore-
closed the two-storied brick house on
the little side street had been put up for
sale it had gone for a song and some
material part of mandragas accumulated
wealth had provided the music

the building was not large it was
certainly not beautiful but it was strong
-the walls were thick-and that sufficed
into this house mandraga had moved his
stacks of rugs and a quantity of old fur-
nishings in the upper part he lived
behind closed shutters its sole tenant

when the nights were dark he would
see that the shutters were fastened most
securely bolt the doors below stairs and
above with the heavy bars with which
every opening had been provided and by
the light of a sputtering candle unlock
certain chests which were hidden about
the quarters and filter through his
trembling fingers the gold and silver

coins that filled them and his heart
would pound in unwonted rhythm to
their music

  satisfied mandraga would then relock
the chests push them back under his bed
or into their accustomed places tie the
small keys about his neck blow out the
candle and creep into bed where the
blended echoes of gold and silver would
lull him to sleep when there was a
moon he would open one of the shutters
slightly enough light would filter
through the iron bars with which the
windows were additionally protected to
make the candle an expensive luxury
moonlight cost him nothing

  one by one the rugs on the floor below
were disappearing the stacks were grow-
ing smaller the precious stock which he
had moved into his dingy shop was
becoming depleted expensive rugs they
were too antiques many of them which
he had disposed of at figures which ran
into the thousands only mandraga and
the expert buyers knew their value-and
mandraga got their price checks drafts
yellow bank-notes bills all these man-
draga quickly translated into metal coins
-quarters half-dollars gold pieces of
every denomination the more money
and the greater variety in sizes and ap-
parent tone the merrier the music these
coins were his slaves he owned them
body and soul they were the blood of
his very life

  slaves he considered i have given
my life for them now they are mine
they give their lives to me

  he ruminated rugs they had not
been his slaves they had but provided
him with a means to obtain his end to
enthrall the hundreds of thousands of
silver and golden slaves which were now
imprisoned in the many chests to others
there was something indefinable in the
mystic carpets of the east romance
the blood veins of the robot



dreams perhaps in their subdued color-
ing which had withstood the ravages of
the centuries to mandraga they were
drab colorless-but worth their weight
in silver and gold coins they consumed
nothing as they aged they grew more
valuable slaves human slaves had re-
quired feeding with age their value had
decreased and then-there was sickness
-and loss he had chosen well

  years ago he remembered there were
profits to be made in the traffic of slaves
in armenia syria turkey persia men
had become rich in that business they
had made money that might just as well
have been his but he had chosen rugs
the buying and selling of slaves had a
risk that terrified him they were ill-
treated and ill-fed many of them were
old and one or more might die on his
hands the loss of their lives was noth-
ing but-the loss of profits if only he
could have bought their souls souls
never die he had heard somewhere

  my little slaves make music he pon-
dered but i want greater music-more
regular music only at night i hear their
voices for more than twenty hours they
are silent hidden in the chests

  could he but contrive some apparatus
that would keep them playing their magic
chords-their sweet symphony-forever
could he find a way to listen to their con-
tinuous jingling day and night without
cessation perhaps some mechanical
contrivance could be fashioned which
would accomplish this he would build
one an automaton of some sort in which
his silver and golden coins would course
through slots in regular order dropping
one after another-now a gold piece
against a silver coin now two small silver
coins against a deep-toned double eagle
what combinations he could provide for
--the many different notes of the scale he
could arrange to please his fancy and

the coins could roll along through these
innumerable slots like blood in the veins
of a man that was it veins with gold
and silver blood it must be continuous
-never-stopping-like a radio receiving
set in constant synchronization with a
never-silent broadcasting station aram
mandragas eyes glittered with uncon-
trolled joy he would be master of this
never-ending bloodstream each coin
would sing again and again its sweetest
note it would pass on through the
mechanism of the machine-mandragas
mechanical golem-the monster concrete
robot he would build-and he would so
contrive that each coin after it fell would
again be lifted up by some mechanical
device which he would construct to take
its place once more in the metal stream
at the top continuous music it might
be made to go on-on-on-night and
day

weeks went by only a few rugs
remained from the great store with
which mandraga had stocked his dingy
shop another chest was now filled with
metal coins the music each night grew
the sweeter and the more mellow as his
horde increased he was growing old
he reasoned now creeping age would
soon enfeeble him it took considerable
exertion at times to drag the chests from
beneath the bed and from under the
window-seats which he had constructed
to hide thern from evil-intentioned eyes
a little while now and he could sit idly
by and listen to the musical clinking of
the coins he had been pondering over
that idea of his-money making its own
music a constant methodical jingling
and blending of those wondrous voices
a plan had gradually formed itself in
his mind materials had been accumu-
lated hundreds of pieces of curved
metal tubing fiber-lined-long short

medium lengths-of many different sizes
had been cut to mandragas designs
these with strangely contrived lifting-
devices on endless chains gears and other
paraphernalia were collected in the rear
of the little shop downstairs where the
rugs had once been stacked less than a
dozen pieces of his once prized stock now
remained the rugs were vanishing but
the many chests were full

  sacks of cement piles of stone and
sand several sheets of perforated steel
aram mandragas plans were at last com-
plete it had cost him many of his little
blood-slaves to fashion the thing of con-
crete and metal which he had designed in
his minds eye-but he had made his
resolve his mechanical robot was ready
to be assembled and then music-never
to be stopped-unless he so willed the
coins his slaves constant-rushing blood
through the metal and fiber veins of his
automaton tingling music-always that
music the concrete robot with the face
and form of a gigantic man-his slave
with the blood he would feed it it
would tingle with ever-pulsing life the
pressure of his finger and the life would
depart from its veins-and his music
would likewise stop but mandragas fin-
gers would again start the brave music
jingle tinkle all the thousand variations
in tone would once more be resumed
his man of stone would live thou-
sands of little slaves within the monster
slave-the little finger of aram man-
draga to control them

  rugs romance of the looms magic
carpets of the east bah they had been
lifeless things only a means to the end
money only mattered coins-hard
metallic silver and gold coins-they were
his god their friendly voices his sub-
lime orchestra and now-tap tap tap-
their music might go on in continuous
rhythm

  a few days passed but one rug re-
mained in the little dingy shop-a faded
brown prayer rug from kashan aram
mandraga took this to his living-quarters
above there would be more room in the
shop below in which to mix the cement
when the workmen came

the next day and for many days there-
after workmen were busy in the
mandraga house aram followed them
about and directed he moved his belong-
ings into the front part of the upper floor
first they walled in all the windows on
the lower floor then the low ceiling in
the rear half of the erstwhile shop was
torn out a solid dividing-wall built across
the room stairs constructed which led
down to this squared room from the floor
above

  when they had finished the result of
their labors stood in the center of the
high two-storied room it was massively
built from the solid ground beneath the
floor to the height of eighteen feet its
general outlines were those of a man-
but mandraga had overlooked nothing-
the finishing touches would be put on by
his own hand plaster and cement had
been prepared he would mold the fea-
tures into the semblance which he had
designed to the workmen it had ap-
peared only a machine of some sort which
they were constructing mandraga would
fashion its huge proportions in secret he
would color it in black and white it
would have thick red lips and a yellow
face its eyes would move its tongue
would push in and out its ears as large
almost as those of a young elephant
would twitch it would show life-as
long as the stream of the little coins
flowed on through its metal veins

  its walls were several inches thick
leaving an interior at its base nearly five
feet wide a man could walk about com-
the blood veins of the robot



fortably standing erect the floor of
concrete sloped down from the center at a
slight angle the pinnacle at the center
was flattened into a small cup-like plat-
form about nine inches across the slight-
ly sloping floor was round in shape with
slots set in at intervals to accommodate
the chain mechanisms which mandraga
had designed to elevate the various coins
to the hopper of concrete constructed at
the very top the flattened tubes of vari-
ous sizes curved from the hopper down
into the space above the small round
sloping-sided platform twisting and
curving as they were they had the ap-
pearance of entrails in a living mechan-
ism each tube opened at some point
directly over the exact center of the little
platform mandraga had so adjusted
each separate tube that a coin dropping
from the hundred or more of these veins
as he had called them would strike each
upon the identical spot of the cup-like re-
ceiver a little pile of coins would always
remain there against which the falling
silver and gold would clink the other
coins would roll off into the sloping pit
over the edges and be picked up by the
constantly operating lifting-apparatus to
be carried once more to the hopper above
then again each coin would start once
more upon its journey

  there were two small windows a few
inches square set in the back of the con-
crete monster just behind the shoulders
through these narrow shafts of light
slanted downward to the apex of the
cone-shaped sounding-platform upon
which the coins would fall narrow slots
in the indow-shutters on the upper
floor were arranged so that they could be
opened at will the outside light-rays per-
mitted to penetrate to the small barred
openings there would be the glint of
sunlight upon the fast-falling pile of gold
and silver coins whenever mandraga

entered the little door and feasted his
eyes upon the constant-flowing stream
beating out its rhythm on the glowing
anvil below the slots

the little door in front was as strong
as the door of a vault as in fact it was
mandraga had discovered this firmly
built door among the cast-off debris in a
building-wreckers junk heap the door
and its framework had been set firmly
into the concrete base of the man-shaped
effigy three little keys inserted one
after another turned one after another
permitted it to be opened keyholes were
in the rear of the little iron door as well
as in front so that it could be unlocked
from the inside should occasion demand
when closed the three steel bolts auto-
matically shot into the sockets of the
frame in the manner of a snap-lock
mandraga carried the three little keys
among the other keys on the string about
his neck

there was another door set just inside
the opening it was fashioned of per-
forated steel sheets which mandraga had
gilded a burnished bronze his fancy had
streaked it with strange designs in red
and black it swung back into the cham-
ber just sufficiently wide to let him
squeeze through whenever he entered
when his music would play the iron
door would be left open-thrown wide
the mellow chords would filter through
sweetly between the thousands of little
openings in his improvised screen what
radio instrument could provide such
harmony innumerable buttons were set
into a control board just at the side of
the outer door a slight pressure on any
one of them would close a corresponding
opening among the many slots in the
hopper at the top of the figure standing
so weirdly in the high room at man-
dragas finger tips were the nerve-centers
which controlled the bloodstream of his


weird tales

monstrous music-box he would experi-
ment in the manner of the man-there-
min by name as he recalled it-who had
drawn music from the air with the wave
of his hands and the flourish of his fin-
gers blending the sounds of chaos into a
perfect harmony thousands millions of
little voices were his to regulate in the
fiber-lined tubes inside he would make
them play their melodies day and night
from his balcony above where he had
now set his bed he could listen to their
music even in his sleep-their intonations
reverberating into his subconscious brain

  time went on the strange-looking
monster stood forth in all its unearthly
glory its wide eyes rolled this way and
that in controlled abandon the big black
pupils as large as a plate its face was
fashioned of rubber over a pliable mesh
of wire levers and rollers kept it in
motion the cheeks distending the heavy
jaws and creased forehead moving slowly
like the features of a live monster-or the
product of a nightmarish dream yellow-
white teeth would be exposed the tip
of a wide red tongue would protrude
from between them restless ears would
quiver the scalp below the matted black
hair would move aram mandraga had
fashioned his masterpiece with studied
care it was inhumanly human

  his cleverest stroke of genius had been
the building of the coin-lifting device it
required power it must be continuously
operative there must be no expense at
first he had considered building some sort
of perpetual-motion device no that
wouldnt do such ideas were crazy
mandraga would have none of them so
he purchased a small strong slow-speed
motor set it into a niche in the concrete
base where its whir would not interfere
with the mellow strains of the music-
machine and fitted a constant-dripping
oiling attachment so that it would never

become overheated with the continuous
friction it could whirl on for a year
without attention then he tapped the
electric wires which passed over his roof
and led into the buildings on either side
he carefully concealed his theft so that
prying eyes would not discover the two
wires which he inserted through a hole
he had drilled between the bricks and
connected up with the little motor there
was his power power forever it
would cost him nothing thin copper
tubing led down from the central oil-tank
to each gear and pinion in the quiet-
moving series of lifting cups no friction
would mar the plaintive strains which the
many coins would play

when mandraga had finished the
fashioning of the strange-built
vault which he had planned to house his
little gold and silver slaves he stood in
admiration before the cyclopean monster
of his creation-pleased with the work of
his brain and hands now he would start
the blood-flow in its veins

  he carried the coins from the chests to
the hopper in the head of the figure lift-
ing up the pressed-steel lid which formed
the scalp and which locked into place by
the manipulation of a lever from the in-
side of the chamber at the base trip
after trip he made over the narrow planks
from the edge of his chamber-balcony to
the shoulders of his man of stone the
chests were empty-the hopper now full
in a moment he would start the motor
the hopper would vibrate convulsively as
he had designed it the current of gold
and silver coins would slip into their ap-
pointed slots in much the same manner
as the brass matrices are distributed in the
magazine of the linotype machine his
man of stone and metal would be en-
dowed with life the blood-veins of the
robot would teem with yellow and silver-
the blood veins of the robot



white cells his slave-his golem-his
frankenstein monster would live he
took down the planks he sat on the
edge of his overlooking balcony his legs
dangling over into the well below his
feet he pressed the switch-button which
controlled the motor close to his hand
the eyes began to move the rubber-
covered features to expand and contract
the coins were flowing then there came
to his straining ears the clink clink clink
of metal against metal the melody of
melodies had begun

  day and night aram mandraga sat on
the edge of his balcony or in the rickety
armchair before the golden perforated-
steel door the outer vault door thrown
wide he would squeeze inside some-
times and watch the ever-dropping stream
of coins glinting in the rays of the slant-
ing lights filtering down from the little
windows above the shoulders that would
be the only light the chamber would be
in darkness except for that little patch of
gold and silver rays beneath the hundreds
of little slots adjusted to a nicety in the
exart center of the coin-filled cup that
formed the anvil against which the little
musicians played their symphony their
work done their note struck they would
flow over into the slight-sloping pit like
water over the lip of a fountain into the
gutters around the circular deposit-pit
they would fall the little cups of the
ever-moving elevators would pick them
up and carry them back to continue their
music

  night and day mandraga would fin-
ger the little buttons on the slot control
board regulating the pace of the little
devils of the machine they obeyed him
implicitly they sang their varying
moods the thing of rubber and wire
showed that it too was alive to the fas-
cination of the metallic intonations re-
sounding in the little chamber at its base

the ever-flowing stream gave it vitality
its yellow face gleamed with joy and life
its eyes seemed to brighten with insane
delight that matched the glistening pleas-
ure shining forth through aram man-
dragas own as he listened in idle ecstasy
to the music dripping within the vault
rolling and ringing in sweetest harmony

  day and night night and day the
plaintive chimes played on there was
something almost pathetic in the childish
way poor old mandraga would unlock
the vault door and sink into the armchair
for his daily round of melody after a rest-
ful blissful sleep going up and down
the ladders while he had been molding
his stone man into the creature that now
stood grimly in the high-ceilinged room
had been toilsome work for a feeble old
man like mandraga but the subsequent
music had lent unusual strength to his
already tottering legs and palsied hands

  my little slaves he observed glee-
fully my prisoners paid for with my
lifes blood he stood back and grinned
up at the twitching rubber face and
you-my creature its my blood that flows
through your veins it plays for me it
makes you live it drips through your
veins-drips-drips-drips hard firm
metal-pounding against hard firm metal
that never yields my little coins

  he went back to his chair he picked
up the little prayer rug from kashan-
the last of his stock

  two hundred dollars you should have
given me he pleaded four hundred
deep-toned voices that might fall through
the half-dollar slots eight hundred
soprano notes for the slots that hold my
little quarters forty golden chimes in
the slots that hold my half-eagles ten
melodious double-eagles that might have
given me music you are useless-wasted
-you are soft like a cushion-

  he pushed open the burnished-gold


weird tales

screen with the strange designs in black
and red he squeezed through and stood
in ecstasy before the little pile of gold
and silver flowing over the lips of the
small raised platform beneath the slot-
openings bathed in the dimming rays
filtering down through the little barred
windows he still clutched the faded
brown prayer rug in his withered right
hand

he had set the slots at a measured
pace the bloodstream dropped method-
ically in the very center of the pile just
beyond his feet drop-drop-drop
gold and silver-throated voices all con-
trolled by his little finger he had drawn
the iron vault door shut the better to hear
the magical music a few minutes alone
with his singing pleasure-makers then
he would slip the three little keys in -the
lock go outside to his deep armchair and
listen to their harmony throughout the
night the concert was more wonderful
than ever tonight the filtering moon-
light coming through the regulated open-
ings in the upper window shutters down
into the music vault glinted blue-white
against the silver and gold he crouched
in a corner and closed his eyes so that
vision might not share with hearing the
music thrilled then soothed his tired
faculties and at length his white head
nodded and mandraga slept

when mandraga opened his eyes he
knew not for the instant where he
was until his ear caught the sound of
the falling coins tinkling into the gutters
he was chilled and aching with a sensa-
tion of great weight bearing him down
he tried to rise from his cramped posture
but his stiffened limbs responded weakly
and he struggled to his feet with consid-
erable difficulty his footing slipped he
reeled and would have fallen had not the
walls of the vault supported him he was

seized with a choking sensation and in
nervous haste stretched his thin hand up-
ward to clutch the string about his neck
which held the keys his trembling fin-
gers touched it-fumbled nervously with
it for a fraction of a moment he would
open the door-get out into the air the
little windows were not providing suffi-
cient ventilation

the string was between his fingers it
broke the keys jingled down into the
heaped pile of coins tumbling happily in
the outward-sloping pit at his feet as
they struck they rang with a clink that
seemed to mock the methodical clink of
the coins dropping down from the
mouths of the slots above the little mound
in the center he reached down for them
his groping hands could not locate them
among the shifting coins

as the full significance of his appalling
situation forced itself upon mandraga his
knees gave way and he sank in a limp
and motionless heap-a prisoner with his
wealth his eyes were closed his head
had fallen sidewise-directly under the
slots above the heap of coins in the cen-
ter each falling coin struck him on the
temple and glanced off among its merry
companions to be picked up by the ris-
ing cups and started again upon its down-
ward journey

mandraga was yet conscioils but with-
out the power to move his mind was
active the coins smote him with pen-
dulum-like regularity until each one
pained like a knife-thrust

so hard-these metal coins he whis-
pered inwardly they strike so hard-
metal strikes on metal-that makes my
music-these tones are soft-as if-they
strike on a cushion that was it a cush-
ion-so that they wouldnt strike so hard
if only - my kashan rug -my little
prayer rug-was over my face-protect-
ing me- he tried to draw the rug
the blood veins of the robot



to his head but his weakened fingers
would not respond to the command of his
will it was no use there could be no
cushion to protea mandragas temple

now the melody of the falling coins
came to him indistinaly as if they were
a great way off and he felt the pain no
longer aram mandraga was drifting-
drifting in a golden ship over a golden
sea the shimmering waters rocked him
gently the waves covered him with glit-
tering spray then mandraga fell into a

dreamless sleep-a sleep wherein the
heart stops and the flickering lights of life
go out the coins continued to fall in
measured accents chanting a weird re-
quiem and wasting their music the
motor whirred on relentlessly the lifting
cups replenished the hopper above the
slot openings the blood flowed on and
on within the veins of the grim man of
stone whose twisting grimacing yellow
face fronted ominously the empty bed on
the balcony

the abominable snow men

  by frank belknap long jr

      blue shadows lay upon the craters rim

      and far above the town a traveller moved
      in circles through the snow his eyes were dim
      from glint of sun on ice in worlds improved

      a thousand feet below him at an inn

      his host smiled wanly said the fool will find

      small prints upon the snow-so small so thin-

      he will not know that they are prints which bind

      he will not know that they are prints which bind

      his very words gained substance on a height

      as to his knees the traveller fell half-blind

      and grovelled in the dimness of his sight

      they dwell in barrows on a skyward wold
      and make no sound shrill hunger is their goad

      tis said they feed on men when men are bold

      when men are scarce on flesh of fowl or toad

      the silence on the heights gave way to shrieks
      as to a shattered cairn the traveller clung
      and fought a shape with bright and slimy streaks
      of blood upon its fat protruding tongue

      they came in swarms from out the craters rim

      the thin snow men abominable and cold

      they came in swarms and tore him limb from limb
      and strewed his flesh in ribbons on the wold
the finishing
touches

by renier wyers

a diabolical little story of an artist who painted a bestial picture of honors
that had better been left alone

tandriv said that he had come
to borrow money blake gave it
to him willingly had they not
formerly been good friends of course
that was long ago and tandriv obviously
had degenerated since then yet-blake
wanted to aid him in some way-just for
auld lang syne

and for auld lang syne blake tried
to stir up conversation is there any-
thing else i tan do he asked as his vis-
itor pocketed the money

no replied tandriv gruffly then
added with an attempt at courtesy ive
been working hard im nervous dont
want to seem ungracious thanks
blake nodded he found it difficult
to realize that this wreck of a man was
the tandriv who had been his classmate
but a few years before the once thick
glossy black hair now hung in dead gray-
ing strands over the tall wrinkled brow
that had been fair and smooth deep
grooves of bitterness were plowed in the
pasty cheeks the tandriv eyes which
had always been a bit too bright now
gleamed as two yellow-green orbs that
were danger signals of approaching mad-
ness

are you working on a painting
blake inquired tentatively

yes

id like to see it sometime tandriv
a cold smile that came dangerously
dose to being a sneer crept over the
others features you wouldnt like it
blake our ideas of art differ youve
become famous for your flattering por-


traits idealizing commonplace people
while i have-wefl im here borrowing
money tonight from you

his expression grew hateful spring-
ing to his feet he began pacing back and
forth

but my time will come he cried ges-
ticulating wildly too long the world
has been blinded by illusions of piety and
goodness-lies you and everyone else
striving for beauty will be forgotten
when im worshipped there is no beauty
in real life or real art theres only pain
and cruelty and horror-thats what im
painting

blakes curiosity was aroused he re-
membered their art student days and how
untractable tandriv had been no one
could teach him anything about art he
refused to follow the classic standards of
composition or color then too the re-
calcitrant tandrivs choice of models had
been the talk of the art colony he would
frequent the lowest dives in paris and
haunt the slums looking for subjects to
portray on canvas aged drunken wom-
en garbage-grubbing old men who had
lived too long idiots misshapen crip-
ples lascivious-faced vixens murderous
apaches rat-like sneak-thieves-all were
limned by the tandriv brush in those
early student years

if i remember correctly said blake
what you are saying now is quite consist-
ent with some of the ideas-and subjects
-you entertained in paris

bah that was only the beginning
                     w t-
the finishing touches



snorted tandriv ive made great strides
since then

toward what

toward what immortality ill prove
it to you come to my place blake and
ill show you a creation the like of which
no man has ever seen before-on canvas
there was a fanatical enthusiasm in his
manner and a hint of forbidden revela-
tion in his tone that resulted in blakes
accompanying him

a brisk twelve-minute walk brought
them to a bleak treeless district of
poverty-tainted tenements and ugly fac-
tory buildings

heres an atmosphere you nice ar-
tists avoid said tandriv as they strode
along through the deserted streets save
for the widely spaced street-lamps there
was no light on the thoroughfare even
the dwelling buildings were darkened for
people who must live in tenements must
rise early and light bills drain the pennies
from kitchen shelves

heres where life is raw and un-
veneered he added here the real
man comes to the surface selfish cow-
ardly and treacherous dog eat dog you
know beauty ha in spots like this
in every big city on the globe glorious
man made in his image and likeness
spawns the future criminals of the world
dont think that this slum is but a phase
of life with no relation to the rest of the
city its the rotten heart of it the en-
slavement of men women and children
behind those factory walls makes it possi-
ble for refined ladies to pay you big
prices for their portraits

he tapped blakes arm and turned
down a side street meaner than the rest
well be there in a minute he said

passing through an areaway between
two tenement houses they came upon a
refuse-littered yard a white full moon

broke clear of the clouds and mercifully
camouflaged the scene with white splashes
of light and black shadow carefully
stepping over and around heaps of rub-
bish and tin cans which prowling rats
could not believe were quite empty the
two men came to tandrivs door at the
side of a long flat brick house

  once inside tandriv turned the switch
on an unshaded light bulb what a de-
pressing workshop thought blake as he
blinked his eyes and looked about the
light revealed the interior of the house as
being one long narrow room its brick
walls unpainted no ceiling hid the
cross-beam that supported the roof dirt
and disorder were everywhere paints
canvases clothing and cooking-utensils
were strewn about indicative of the slov-
enliness of the man who ate slept and
painted here

  blakes attention however was soon
drawn to a huge painting leaning against
the rear wall of the studio it reached
from the floor to the roof and from one
side wall to the other fitting snugly be-
tween it was fully fifteen feet high
and at least three times as wide

  good lord tandriv gasped blake
hoarsely what is it what does it
mean

  revolted yet fascinated by the very
hideousness of the painting he stared at
it for a long time it was like looking
into an immense window of hell against
which swarmed a myriad of things with
distorted faces and ectoplasmic bodies
seeking to enter this world from a terrible
dimension outside human ken

  now blake knew what tandriv had
meant when he said his earlier works had
been only the beginning these things
were the development the painting was
a decadent exaggeration of all evil with
all trace of anything redeeming omitted
it was an array of bestial libidinous


weird tales

thoughts given a semblance of ugly ante-
human form by a brush that had been
dipped in oils of primordial ooze so
crowded with the things was the canvas
that no background or perspective was
shown

  one figure in particular near the cen-
ter of the picture seemed to reveal the
motif of the work to blakes startled eyes
it had a sinister elongated ocher-colored
face surmounted by a gnarled forehead
from which protruded two horns its
upper torso was of human proportions but
covered with bluish-green scales rearing
up on two furry goat-like legs that ter-
minated in cloven hooves it appeared the
most menacing of all because of its like-
ness to man and because of the malignant
intelligence in its features

  that shall be my masterpiece blake
heard tandriv hiss im putting my very
soul into it ive been planning it sketch-
ing it for years-gathering material for
its execution and seeking atmosphere for
it in all parts of the world

  you know that i started my search
while we were studying together he
went on but you did not know what be-
came of me after that ive been every-
where ive witnessed black masses pre-
sided over by apostates from every creed
i went eastward and southward to the
cradle of the human race and human sin
i went farther eastward and lived among
the outcasts from lhassa who crouch in
wind-swept caves of the tibetan him-
alayas for more than a year with my
skin dyed black as coal i officiated at
voodoo rites in the west indian jungle

  who is better qualified to paint that
picture than i he concluded boastfully

  but tandriv its horrible-obscene
what are you striving for

  what difference does it make to you
tandriv retorted i tell you ive had a
call to make that painting-a commis-

sion from the powers that ruled before
man and his gods and will rule again
then observing blakes fixed stare he
added that central figure which appar-
ently interests you is my guide and in-
spiration call him lucifer ahrimanes
belial satan or what you will-names
and words mean nothing but my por-
trait will awaken the world to what and
who he really is

  all vestige of sanity was wiped from
his face as he raised his clenched fists and
cried deliriously

  only a few more finishing touches
and my work will be done i must finish-
i must paint what i see-the only things
i see night and day for years they have
burned themselves into my brain the
real things of life blake-real real
then you and i see life differently
said blake with an uneasy little laugh he
regretted having come to view this dia-
bolic daub although he tried to look at
it objectively it had started a mental
maelstrom in which his critical faculties
and primal fears whirled about confused-
ly making technical shop-talk impossible
well he didnt have to stand here gazing
at the accursed picture besides tandriv
somewhat calmer now was still decidedly
unsociable apparently he wanted to get
back to work at his evil miscreation there
was no use trying to reason with him
blake left   

  returning to his own apartment he
tried to forget what he had seen but
the pageant of foulness persistently in-
truded upon his consciousness he dozed
in fitful slumber every time he closed
his eyes the painted horrors danced before
him after an interminable period of
restless tossing he arose gray day was
breaking

mechanically donning his clothing
he left the house for some rea-

weird tales

     continued from page 
son not quite clear to himself he followed
the route he and tandriv had taken some
hours before as in a dream he trudged
through the morning fog and turned into
the cold damp areaway

stepping into the disordered little yard
he pulled himself up out of his somnam-
bulistic state with a start something had
happened people were standing about
poorly clad working-people from the
neighborhood were standing in a huddled
group talking with subdued excitement
a note of superstitious awe ran through
their murmuring two uniformed po-
licemen stood guard before the door to
tandrivs studio

 tis the devil blake heard one pug-
nacious little old woman say that got
mister tandriv didnt i hear him a-
talkin with the devil many a night an
didnt i see the red fire of hell a-gleamin
through the cracks in his door and win-
dow shades

yes yes i heard him too said an-
other woman fumbling with a shawl
about her head

he was after callin to the devil agin
last night went on the first woman
then all of a sudden theres a rumblin
like thunder only theres no storm in the
sky and the rumblin comes from under-
ground and theres terrible wailin like
a thousand banshees and the red gleam
lights up the whole alley so that you can
see the rats run for cover

 twas the wailin and screamin that
woke me said a third woman i told
my john to find out whos makin the
awful racket in mister tandrivs place
but john wouldnt get up him sayin its
none of our business what a crazy artist
is doin in the middle o the night
waiting to hear no more blake shoul-
dered his way through the crowd to the
policemen the elder of whom after sat-

isfying himself that blake was not of the
neighborhood or an idle curiosity-seeker
agreed to let him enter the studio

  its o k cassidy the officer re-
marked to his younger partner maybe
this man can throw some light on the
case-he says he knew tandriv but
mind you dont either of you touch any-
thing til the coroner comes

  blake escorted by the young patrol-
man went inside the place was a sham-
bles it was as though titanic forces had
struggled here every piece of furniture
was smashed in the center of the debris
was the mangled body of tandriv

  theres been hell to pay here ob-
served cassidy as he and blake stood over

horror at what he saw the body gro-
tesquely twisted was heaped on the floor
as though it had fallen from a great
height or been violently hurled to the bare
boards from its twisted position it was
apparent that both legs and arms were
broken the eyes of the victim were
rolled upward their pupils half hidden
under the upper lids as a final touch to
the terrible deed there was stamped on
the dead mans brow the impression of a
cloven hoof

tsang was fighting coolly but
with contemptuous ease the count
broke his holds and tsang was
just able to avoid being rendered helpless
once he was nearly caught by that neck
grip which had so effectually disposed of
fletcher another time he groaned as
mazzino tore at his hand almost breaking
the fingers

  then tsang seemed to tire his parries
grew less sure the count laughed for
fletcher it was a heart-breaking sound
it indicated triumph

with a sigh the small chinese relaxed

fletcher made a mighty effort to rise
to go to tsangs rescue he lurched to
his knees a sobbing moan bubbled
through his froth-covered lips he closed
his eyes to shut out the sight of his
friends death-

unhappy is he to whom the mem-
ories of childhood bring only
fear and sadness wretched is he
who looks back upon lone hours in vast
and dismal chambers with brown hang-
ings and maddening rows of antique
books or upon awed watches in twilight
groves of grotesque gigantic and vine-
encumbered trees that silently wave
twisted branches far aloft such a lot the
gods gave to me-to me the dazed the
disappointed the barren the broken
and yet i am strangely content and cling
desperately to those sere memories when
my mind momentarily threatens to reach
beyond to the other

   i know not where i was born save
that the castle was infinitely old and in-
finitely horrible full of dark passages
and having high ceilings where the eye
could find only cobwebs and shadows
the stones in the crumbling corridors
seemed always hideously damp and there
was an accursed smell everywhere as of
the piled-up corpses of dead generations
it was never light so that i used some-
times to light candles and gaze steadily
at them for relief nor was there any sun

from weird tales april 

   

outdoors since the terrible trees grew
high above the topmost accessible tower
there was one black tower which readied
above the trees into the unknown outer
sky but that was partly ruined and could
not be ascended save by a well-nigh im-
possible climb up the sheer wall stone by
stone

  i must have lived years in this place
but i can not measure the time beings
must have cared for my needs yet i can
not recall any person except myself or
anything alive but the noiseless rats and
bats and spiders i think that whoever
nursed me must have been shockingly
aged since my first conception of a living
person was that of something mockingly
like myself yet distorted shriveled and
decaying like the castle to me there was
nothing grotesque in the bones and skel-
etons that strewed some of the stone
crypts deep down among the founda-
tions i fantastically associated these
things with everyday events and thought
them more natural than the colored pic-
tures of living beings which i found in
many of the moldy books from such
books i learned all that i know no
teacher urged or guided me and i do not
recall hearing any human voice in all
those years-not even my own for al-
though i had read of speech i had never
thought to try to speak aloud my aspect

was a matter equally unthought of for
there were no mirrors in the castle and i
merely regarded myself by instinct as akin
to the youthful figures i saw drawn and
painted in the books i felt conscious of
youth because i remembered so little

  outside across the putrid moat and
under the dark mute trees i would often
lie and dream for hours about what i
read in the books and would longingly
picture myself amidst gay crowds in the
sunny world beyond the endless forest
once i tried to escape from the forest
but as i went farther from the castle the
shade grew denser and the air more filled
with brooding fear so that i ran franti-
cally back lest i lose my way in a labyrinth
of nighted silence

  so through endless twilights i dreamed
and waited though i knew not what i
waited for then in the shadowy solitude
my longing for light grew so frantic that
i could rest no more and i lifted entreat-
ing hands to the single black ruined
tower that reached above the forest into
the unknown outer sky and at last i
resolved to scale that tower fall though
i might since it were better to glimpse
the sky and perish than to live without
ever beholding day

in the dank twilight i climbed the worn
and aged stone stairs till i reached the
level where they ceased and thereafter
clung perilously to small footholds lead-
ing upward ghastly and terrible was
that dead stairless cylinder of rock black
ruined and deserted and sinister with
startled bats whose wings made no noise
but more ghastly and terrible still was the
slowness of my progress for climb as i
might the darkness overhead grew no
thinner and a new chill as of haunted
and venerable mold assailed me i shiv-
ered as i wondered why i did not reach
the light and would have looked down
had i dared i fancied that night had

weird tales

come suddenly upon me and vainly
groped with one free hand for a window
embrasure that i might peer out and
above and try to judge the height i had
attained

  all at once after an infinity of awe-
some sightless crawling up that concave
and desperate precipice i felt my head
touch a solid thing and knew i must have
gained the roof or at least some kind of
floor in the darkness i raised my free
hand and tested the barrier finding it
stone and immovable then came a dead-
ly circuit of the tower clinging to what-
ever holds the slimy wall could give till
finally my testing hand found the barrier
yielding and i turned upward again
pushing the slab or door with my head as
i used both hands in my fearful ascent
there was no light revealed above and
as my hands went higher i knew that my
climb was for the nonce ended since the
slab was the trap-door of an aperture
leading to a level stone surface of greater
circumference than the lower tower no
doubt the floor of some lofty and capa-
cious observation chamber i crawled
through carefully and tried to prevent
the heavy slab from falling back into
place but failed in the latter attempt as
i lay exhausted on the stone floor i heard
the eery echoes of its fall but hoped
when necessary to pry it up again

  believing i was now at a prodigious
height far above the accursed branches
of the wood i dragged myself up from
the floor and fumbled about for windows
that i might look for the first time upon
the sky and the moon and stars of which
i had read but on every hand i was dis-
appointed since all that i found were vast
shelves of marble bearing odious oblong
boxes of disturbing size more and more
i reflected and wondered what hoary se-
crets might abide in this high apartment
so many eons cut off from the castle be-
low then unexpectedly my hands came

upon a doorway where hung a portal of
stone rough with strange chiseling try
ing it i found it locked but with a su-
preme burst of strength i overcame all
obstacles and dragged it open inward as
i did so there came to me the purest
ecstasy i have ever known for shining
tranquilly through an ornate grating of
iron and down a short stone passageway
of steps that ascended from the newly
found doorway was the radiant full
moon which i had never before seen save
in dreams and in vague visions i dared
not call memories

fancying now that i had attained the
very pinnacle of the castle i commenced
to rush up the few steps beyond the door
but the sudden veiling of the moon by a
cloud caused me to stumble and i felt
my way more slowly in the dark it was
still very dark when i reached the grating
-which i tried carefully and found un-
locked but which i did not open for fear
of falling from the amazing height to
which i had climbed then the moon
came out

most demoniacal of all shocks is that
of the abysmally unexpected and gro-
tesquely unbelievable nothing i had
before undergone could compare in ter-
ror with what i now saw with the bizarre
marvels that sight implied the sight it-
self was as simple as it was stupefying
for it was merely this instead of a dizzy-
ing prospect of treetops seen from a lofty
eminence there stretched around me on
the level through the grating nothing less
than the solid ground decked and diversi-
fied by marble slabs and columns and
overshadowed by an ancient stone church
whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in
the moonlight

half unconscious i opened the grat-
ing and staggered out upon the white
gravel path that stretched away in two
directions my mind stunned and chaotic
as it was still held the frantic craving
weird tales	

for light and not even the fantastic won-
der which had happened could stay my
course i neither knew nor cared whether
my experience was insanity dreaming or
magic but was determined to gaze on
brilliance and gayety at any cost i knew
not who i was or what i was or what my
surroundings might be though as i con-
tinued to stumble along i became con-
scious of a kind of fearsome latent mem-
ory that made my progress not wholly
fortuitous i passed under an arch out of
that region of slabs and columns and
wandered through the open country
sometimes following the visible road
but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread
across meadows where only occasional
ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a
forgotten road once i swam across a
swift river where crumbling mossy ma-
sonry told of a bridge long vanished

over two hours must have passed be-
fore i reached what seemed to be my goal
a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wood-
ed park maddeningly familiar yet full
of perplexing strangeness to me i saw
that the moat was filled in and that some
of the well-known towers were demol-
ished whilst new wings existed to con-
fuse the beholder but what i observed
with chief interest and delight were the
open windows - gorgeously ablaze with
light and sending forth sound of die gay-
est revelry advancing to one of these i
looked in and saw an oddly dressed com-
pany indeed making merry and speak-
ing brightly to one another i had never
seemingly heard human speech before
and could guess only vaguely what was
said some of the faces seemed to hold
expressions that brought up incredibly
remote recollections others were utterly
alien

i now stepped through the low window
into the brilliantly lighted room step-
ping as i did so from my single bright

moment of hope to my blackest convul-
sion of despair and realization the night-
mare was quick to come for as i entered
there occurred immediately one of the
most terrifying demonstrations i had ever
conceived scarcely had i crossed the sill
when there descended upon the whole
company a sudden and unheralded fear
of hideous intensity distorting every face
and evoking the most horrible screams
from nearly every throat flight was
universal and in the clamor and panic
several fell in a swoon and were dragged
away by their madly fleeing companions
many covered their eyes with their hands
and plunged blindly and awkwardly in
their race to escape overturning furniture
and stumbling against the walls before
they managed to reach one of the many
doors

  the cries were shocking and as i
stood in the brilliant apartment alone and
dazed listening to their vanishing echoes
i trembled at the thought of what might
be lurking near me unseen at a casual
inspection the room seemed deserted but
when i moved toward one of the alcoves
 thought i detected a presence there-a
hint of motion beyond the golden-arched
doorway leading to another and some-
what similar room as i approached the
arch i began to perceive the presence
more clearly and then with the first and
last sound i ever uttered-a ghastly ulula-
tion that revolted me almost as poignant-
ly as its noxious cause-i beheld in full
frightful vividness the inconceivable in-
describable and unmentionable monstros-
ity which had by its simple appearance
changed a merry company to a herd of
delirious fugitives

  i can not even hint what it was like
for it was a compound of all that is un-
clean uncanny unwelcome abnormal
and detestable it was the ghoulish shade
of decay antiquity and desolation the
putrid drippirig eidolon of unwholesome

revelation the awful baring of that which
the merciful earth should always hide
god knows it was not of this world-or
no longer of this world-yet to my hor-
ror i saw in its eaten-away and bone-
revealing outlines a leering abhorrent
travesty on the human shape and in its
moldy disintegrating apparel an unspeak-
able quality that chilled me even more

  i was almost paralyzed but not too
much so to make a feeble effort toward
flight a backward stumble which failed
to break the spell in which the nameless
voiceless monster held me my eyes be-
witched by the glassy orbs which stared
loathsomely into them refused to close
though they were mercifully blurred and
showed the terrible object but indistinctly
after the first shock i tried to raise my
hand to shut out the sight yet so stunned
were my nerves that my arm could not
fully obey my will the attempt how-
ever was enough to disturb my balance
so that i had to stagger forward several
steps to avoid falling as i did so i be-
came suddenly and agonizingly aware of
the nearness of the carrion thing whose
hideous hollow breathing i half fancied
i could hear nearly mad i found my-
self yet able to throw out a hand to ward
off the fetid apparition which pressed so
close when in one cataclysmic second of
cosmic nightmarishness and hellish acci-
dent my fingers touched the rotting out-
stretched paw of the monster beneath the
golden arch

  i did not shriek but all the fiendish
ghouls that ride the night-wind shrieked
for me as in that same second there
crashed down upon my mind a single and
fleeting avalanche of soul-annihilating
memory i knew in that second all that
had been i remembered beyond the
frightful castle and the trees and recog-
nized the altered edifice in which i now
stood i recognized most terrible of all
the unholy abomination that stood leering
weird tales



before me as i withdrew my sullied fin-
gers from its own

  but in the cosmos there is balm as well
as bitterness and that balm is nepenthe
in the supreme horror of that second i
forgot what had horrified me and the
burst of black memory vanished in a
chaos of echoing images in a dream i
fled from that haunted and accursed pile
and ran swiftly and silently in the moon-
light when i returned to the church-
yard place of marble and went down the
steps i found the stone trap-door immov-
able but i was not sorry for i had hated
the antique castle and the trees now i
ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls
on the night wind and play by day
amongst the catacombs of nephren-ka in
the sealed and unknown valley of hadoth
by the nile i know that light is not for
me save that of the moon over the rock
tombs of neb nor any gayety save the
unnamed feasts of nitokris beneath the
great pyramid yet in my new wildness
and freedom i almost welcome the bitter-
ness of alienage

  for although nepenthe has calmed me
i know always that i am an outsider a
stranger in this century and among those
who are still men this i have known
ever since i stretched out my fingers to
the abomination within that great gilded
frame stretched out my fingers and
touched a cold and unyielding surface of
polished glass

  that was a marvelous stroke i am
beholden toyou for my life

  tam flushed

  it was nothing he replied a great
swordsman taught me and i have had
much practise on the hard skulls of buf-
faloes

  then you are a hunter can you find
meat for me  i have not eaten for three
days and am faint from hunger

  i will get you much meat and quick-
ly responded tam he picked up his
yatagan and wiped it on the flank of the
tiger here was meat but not of a kind
that he could bring himself to eat leop-
ards caracals ounces or any other felines
were all right for food according to his
ideas but despite lozongs teaching he
could not get over the feeling that tigers
were his own kind-that to eat the flesh of
one of these beasts would be an act of
cannibalism and it was quite evident
that the girl did not consider the beast he
had slain fit for food

  come with me he invited
together they leaped the little brook
crossed the grass plot and entered the
bamboo thicket as they were traversing
this tam heard the sound for which he
had been listening-the discordant cry of
a peacock

  follow quietly behind me he said
there is food

  as he moved silently through the bam-
boos he took his bow from the quiver
strung it and drew forth an arrow the
bow twanged and a magnificent bird fell
to the ground where it fluttered for a
moment then lay still

back to the brook they went to pluck
draw and wash the bird and to build
a cooking fire soon they were broiling
slabs of peacock breast impaled on green
bamboo over the hot coals

  it tastes even better than it looks

said the girl as she sampled her first
mouthful

  it is the favorite meat of tigers re-
plied tam between mouthfuls  and they
are good judges of meat they live on
it

  you seem to know a great deal about
tigers said the girl tell me who you
are and more about yourself

  my name is tam he replied and
i was raised by a white tigress

  by a white tigress she exclaimed
the prophecy

  what prophecy

  it is a secret i should not have men-
tioned it

never mind replied tam ill for-
get it prophecies bore me anyhow tell
me who you are and where you live
my name is nina she said and i
live in iramatri

  never heard of that country said
tam vbut ive heard the name nina
she was a goddess one of the first god-
desses in faa they worshipped her
about five thousand years ago

  and longer replied the girl fifty
thousand years ago men worshipped
nina

  there are no records that old said
tam so how could you know that

  as he spoke he looked into her eyes
she was regarding him oddly for some
reason a chill ran down his spine

  why you wear a uraeus he ex-
claimed noticing her serpent diadem for
the first time nina was a serpent god-
dess

  as he uttered these words her eyes
flashed with a strange light like that of
the rubies that smoldered in the uraeus
they seemed to burn into his very being
bringing a disconcerting sensation of ut-
ter helplessness he tried to move to
shake off the feeling but found himself as
powerless as if he had suddenly been

turned to stone the meat which he was
holding over the coals burned to a crisp
unheeded

  you know much for a modern earth-
ling said the girl finally i thought
the world had forgotten nina

  as suddenly as it had come tams feel-
ing of helplessness departed

  so it has almost replied tam
she has been worshipped under the
names of ishtar isis ashtoreth tanit and
persephone as tanit she still has a few
followers in the vicinity of old carthage
and as ishtar superstitions concerning her
are preserved throughout the world
though her followers are referred to as
witches and wizards

  she withdrew from the world five
thousand years ago said nina because
of the crimes that were committed in her
name zealots stained her altars with
human blood parents offered their chil-
dren to be burned by sadistic priests think-
ing to please her these same priests
corrupted her vestal virgins then urged
by their lust for gold made brothels of her
temples and when she left the world of
earthlings the priests set up graven images
in her place and called upon the people to
worship these in her stead she could
have destroyed them all but preferred to
leave them to work out their own destruc-
tion

  which they did to perfection said
tam there are ruins scattered around
the mediterranean from rome to karnak
which testify to that but tell me how
is it that you know so much about this god-
dess can it be that you-

  he paused suddenly as there came to
his ears a sound like the roll of distant
thunder-or elephants stampeding the
girl heard it at the same time and they
both stood up looking out over the wav-
ing grass tips tam saw converging to-
ward them a semicircle of beasts that

sprinted for the bamboo thicket but
they had not gone a hundred feet when
they were halted by a shower of stones
and there charged out at them from the
thicket a mob of hairy shambling crea-

were armed with slings and clubs and
each carried a bag of large pebbles that
hung from a cord around his neck

  they saw our smoke and sent the

an arrow through the breast of the fore-

the others paused but did not cease hurl-

brought down the first of these with an
arrow through the left eye then he

and ran forward whirling his tulwar and

from the brazen collar they he whipped
out his yatagan and dah and awaited the
onslaught as they came together the
giant swung his tulwar in a neck-cut that
would have decapitated the youth had it
landed but tam ducked and extended
his point wounding his adversary in the
groin

  after that they fenced blade clashing
with blade and tam was sorely put to it
not only to defend himself from the

phantoms

by alice i anson

   icy finger-tips of rain
   tap upon my window-pane
   lonely specters pace the gloom
   of my ivy-mantled room
   when the last faint bars of light
   usher in the boundless night
   foolish passions brief and vain
   agonies of joy and pain

   not a single one was worth
   all the pangs that gave it birth
   they are dead as drifted leaves
   underneath the dripping eaves
   or as blasted fruit that falls
   by an orchards crumbling walls
   when the chill november flood
   pours and pours until my blood
   is cold as the half-frozen rain
   darkness brings the ghosdy train
