weird tales

north atlantic coast can very well be
but in the very midst of the tempest i
became afflicted with a mild form of
claustrophobia so i donned sea-boots oil-
skins and souwester hat and sallied
forth for a walk along the shore

  my little cottage stood at the top of a
high cliff there was a broad safe path
running down to the beach and down it
i hurried the short winter day was even
then drawing to a close and after id
trudged a quarter of a mile along the
shore i decided id best return to my
comfortable fireside the walk had at
least given me a good appetite

  there was none of the usual lingering
twilight of a clear winter evening dark-
ness fell so abruptly i was glad id
brought along a powerful flashlight id
almost reached the foot of my path up
the cliff when i halted incredulous yet
desiring to make sure

  i turned the ray of the flashlight on
the great comber just curling to break on
the shore and held the light steady my
breath gasping in my throat such a thing
as i thought id seen couldnt be-yet
it was

  i started to run to the rescue and
could not move a foot a power stronger
than my own will held me immovable i
could only watch spellbound and even
as i stared that gigantic comber gently
subsided depositing its precious living
burden on the sands as softly as any
nurse laying a babe into a cradle

  waist-deep in a smother of foam she
stood for a brief second then calmly
waded ashore and walked with free
swinging stride straight up the beam of
my flashlight to where i stood

  regardless of the hellish din and tur-
moil of the tempest i thrilled old as i
am at the superb loveliness of this most
amazing specimen of flotsam ever a rag-
ing sea cast ashore within memory of
man

  never a shred of clothing masked her
matchless body yet her flesh glowed
rosy-white when by all natural laws it
should have been blue-white from the icy
chill of wintry seas

  well i exclaimed where did you
come from are you real-or am i seeing
that which is not

  i am real replied a clear silvery
voice and i came from out there an
exquisitely molded arm flung a gesture
toward the raging ocean the ship i
was on was sinking so i stripped off my
garb flung myself on rans bosom and
rans horses gave me a most magnificent
ride but well for you that you stood
still as i bade you while i walked ashore
ran is an angry god and seldom well-
disposed toward mortals

  ran the sea-god of the old norse
vikings what strange woman was this
who talked of ran and his horses
the white-maned waves of old ocean
but then i bethought me of her naked
state in diat unholy tempest

  surely you must be rans daughter
i said that reef is ten miles off land
come-i have a house near by and com-
forts-you cannot stand here

   lead and i will follow she replied
simply

she went up that path with greater
ease than i and walked companion-
ably beside me from path-top to house
although she made no talk oddly i
felt that she was reading me and that
what she read gave her comfort

  when i opened the door it seemed
as if she held back for a merest moment

   enter i bade her a bit testily i
should think youd had enough of this
weather by now

  she bowed her head with a natural
stateliness which convinced me that she
was no common person and murmured
something too low for me to catch but
the sea-witch



the accents had a distinct scandinavian
trend

  what did you say i queried for i
supposed shed spoken to me

  i invoked the favor of the old gods
on die hospitable of heart and on the
sheltering roof tree she replied then
she crossed my threshold but she readied
out her arm and rested her shapely white
hand lightly yet firmly on my left fore-
arm as she stepped within

  she went direct to the big stove whidi
was glowing dull-red and stood there
smiling slightly calm serene wholly
ignoring her nakedness obviously enjoy-
ing the warmth and not by a single
shiver betraying that she had any chill
as result of exposure

   i think you need this i said proffer-
ing a glass of brandy theres time
enough for exdianging names and giving
explanations later i added but right
now ill try and find something for you
to put on i have no womens things in
the house as i live alone but will do the
best i can

  i passed into my bedroom laid out a
suit of pajamas and a heavily quilted
bathrobe and returned to the living-room
where she stood

  you are a most disconcertingly beau-
tiful young woman i stated bluntly
which you know quite well without
being told but doubtless you will feel
more at ease if you go in there and don
some things ive laid out for you when
you come out ill get some supper
ready

  she was back instantly still unclad i
stared wonderingly

  those things did not fit she
shrugged and that heavy robe-in this
warm house

  but- i began

  but-this she smiled catching up
a crimson silk spread embroidered in
gold which covered a sandalwood table

id brought from the orient many years
before a couple of swift motions and
the gorgeous thing became a wondrous
robe adorning her lovely figure clinging
and in some subtle manner hinting at the
flawless splendor of her incomparable
body a long narrow scarf of black silk
whereon twisted a silver dragon was
whipped from its place on a shelf and
transposed into a sash from her swelling
breasts to her sloping hips bringing out
more fully every exquisite curve of her
slender waist and torso-and she smiled
again

  now she laughed softly am i
still a picture for your eyes i hope so
for you have befriended me this night-
i who sorely need a friend and it is such
a little thing i can do-making myself
pleasing in your sight

  and because you have holpen me-
i stared at the ardiaic form she used-
and will continue to aid and befriend
for so my spirit tells me i will love
you always love you as ragnar wave-
flame loved jarl wulf red-brand   
as a younger sister or a dutiful niece

  yet of her it is told i interrupted
deliberately speaking swedish and watch-
ing keenly to see the effect that the love
given by the foam-born sea-witch
brought old earl wulf of the red-sword
but little luck and that not of a sort
desired by most men

  that is ill said she retorted his
fate was from the noms as is the fate
of all not hers the fault of his doom
and when his carles within the hour cap-
tured his three slayers she took red
vengeance with her own foam-white
hands she flayed them alive and covered
their twitching bodies with salt ere she
placed the old jarl in his long-ship and
set it afire and she sailed with that old
man on his last seafaring steering his
blazing dragon-ship out of the stead
singing of his great deeds in life that


weird tales

the heroes in valhalla might know wtho
honored them by his coming

  she paused her superb bosom heaving
tumultuously then with a visible effort
she calmed herself

  but you speak my tongue and know
the old tales of the skalds are you
then a swede

  i speak the tongue and the old tales
of the skalds the ancient minstrels i
learned from my grandmother who was
of your race

  of my race her tone held a curious
inflection ah yes all women are of
one race    perhaps

  but i spoke of supper i said mov-
ing toward the kitchen

  but-no she barred my progress
with one of her lovely hands laid flat
against my chest it is not meet and
fitting jarl wulf that you should cook
for me like any common house-carle
rather let your niece heldra prepare
for you a repast

   heldra that then is your name
heldra helstrom and your loving
niece she nodded

  but why call me jarl wulf i de-
manded curious to understand she had
bestowed the name seriously rather than
in playful banter

  jarl wulf you were in a former
life she asserted flatly i knew you on
the shore even before rans horse stood
me on my feet

  surely then you must be ragnar
wave-flame born again i countered

  how may that be she retorted
ragnar wave-flame never died and
surely i do not look that old the sea-
born witch returned to the sea-caves
whence she came when the dragon-ship
burned out    but ask me not of my-
self now

  yet one thing more i will say the
warp and woof of this strange pattern
wherein we both are depicted was woven

of the norns ere the world began we
have met before-we meet again here
and now-we shall meet yet again but
how and when and where i may not
say

  of a truth you are fey i muttered
at times-i am she assented then
her wondrous sapphire eyes gleamed
softly into my own hard gray eyes her
smile was tender wistful womanly and
my doubts were dissipated like wisps of
smoke yet i shook an admonitory fore-
finger at her

  witch at least i know you to be i
said in mock harshness casting glamyr
on an old man

  no need for witchery she laughed
all women possess that power

during the repast she spread be-
fore me i told her that regardless
of who i might have been in a dim and
remote past of which i had no memory
in this present life i was plain john
craig retired professor of anthropology
edinology and archeology and living on
a very modest income i explained that
while i personally admired her and she
wtas welcome to remain in my home for
ever yet in the village near by were curi-
ous minds and gossiping tongues and
evil thoughts a-plenty and if i were to

tell the truth of her arrival-

  but i have nowhere to go and none
save you to befriend me all i loved or
owned is out there again she indicated
the general direction of the reef and
you say that i may remain here indefi-
nitely i will be known as your niece
heldra no surely considering the dif-
ferences in our age and appearance there
can be no slander

  her eyes said a thousand things no
words could convey there w-as eager-
ness sadness and a strange tender-
ness  i came to an abrupt decision
after all whose business was it   
the sea-witch



  i am alone in the world as you are
i said gravely  as my niece heldra
you shall remain if you will write out a
list of a womans total requirements in
wearing-apparel i will send away as soon
as possible and have them shipped here
in haste i am old as all can see and i
do not think any sensible persons will
suspect aught untoward in your making
your home with me and i will think up
a plausible story which will satisfy the
minds of fools without telling in reality
anything

  our repast ended we arose from the
table and returned to the living-room i
filled and lighted a nargilyeh a three-
stemmed water-pipe and settled myself
in my armchair she helped herself to a
cigarette from a box on the table then
stretched her long slender body at full
length on my divan in full relaxation of
comfort

  i told her enough of myself and my
forebears to insure her being able to carry
out hie fiction of being my niece and in
return i learned mighty little about her
but what she did tell me was sufficient
i never was unduly curious about other
peoples business

  unexpectedly and most impolitely i
yawned yet it was natural enough and
it struck me that she needed a rest if any-
one ever did but before i could speak
she forestalled me

  with a single graceful movement she
rose from her reclining posture and came
and stood before me within easy arms-
reach two swift motions and her su-
perb body flashed rosy-white as nude as
when she waded ashore

  the crimson silken spread shed worn
as regally as any robe was laid at my feet
with a single gesture the black scarf went
across my knees and the glorious creature
was kneeling before me in attitude of ab-
solute humility before i could remon-
strate or bid her arise her silvery voice

rang softly solemnly like a muted
trumpet

  thus naked and with empty hands
out of the wintry seas in a twilight gray
and cold on a night of storm i came
and you lighted a beacon for my tired
eyes that i might see my way ashore
you led me up the cliff and to your hos-
pitable hearth and in your kindly heart
you had already given the homeless a
home

  and now kneeling naked before you
as i came i place my hands between your
hands-thus-and all that i am and such
service as i can render are yours hand-
fasted

  i stared well-nigh incredulous in ef-
fect in the old norse manner she was
declaring herself to all intents and pur-
poses my slave but her silvery voice
went on

  and now i rise and cover myself
again with the mantle of your bounty
that you may know me indeed your niece
as jarl wulf knew ragnar wave-flame

  truly i gasped in amazement when
i could catch my breath you are a
strange mixture of the ancient days and
this modern period i have known you
but for a few hours yet i feel toward
you as that old jarl must have felt toward
that other sea-witch unless indeed you
and she are one

  almost she replied a trifle somber-
ly at least she was my ancestress
then she added swiftly do not mis-
understand leman to the old jarl she
never was but later after he went to
valhalla in the sea-girt isle where she
dwelt she mated with a young viking
whom ran had cast ashore sorely wound-
ed and insensible she nursed him back
to life for sake of his beauty and he made
love to her

  but he soon tired of her and her
witch ways wherefore in wrath she gave
him back to ran-and he was seen no


weird tales

more of that mating was bom a daugh-
ter also given to ran who pitied her
and bore her to an old man and his wife
whose steading was nigh to the mouth of
a fjord and they being childless called
her ranhild and reared her as their
daughter in course of time she wed
and bore three tall sons and a daugh-
ter   

  that was long and long ago-yet i
have dived into ragnars hidden sea-cave
and talked with ragnar wave-flame face
to face all one night i lay in her arms
and in the dawning she breathed her
breath on my brow lips and bosom and
all that following day she talked and i
listened and much i learned of the wis-
dom that an elder world termed witch-
craft

  for a moment she lapsed into silence
then she leaned forward laid her shape-
ly cool hands on my temples and kissed
me on my furrowed old forehead very
solemnly yet with ineffable gentleness

  and now she murmured ask me
never again aught concerning myself i
pray you for i have told all i may and
further questioning will drive me back
to the sea and i would not have that
happen-yet

  without another word she turned
flung herself at full length again on the
divan and like any tired child went in-
stantly to sleep decidedly i thought
this niece of mine was not as are other
women and later i found that she pos-
sessed certain abilities it is well for the
world that few indeed can wield

she gave me anodier proof of that be-
lief by demonstrating her unholy
powers on the night of the next full
moon after her arrival

  it was her custom of an evening to ar-
ray herself as she had done on her first
night-in crimson robe and black sash
and naught else despite the fact that her

wardrobe which i had ordered from the
great city forty miles away contained all
any womans heart could wish for but
i admit i enjoyed seeing her in that semi-
barbaric attire

  at times she would sit on the arm of
my chair often with her smooth cool
cheek laid against my rough old face and
her exquisitely modeled arm curved about
my leathery old neck the first time she
had done that i had demanded ironi-
cally

  witch are you making love to me
but her sighing wistful reply had dis-
armed me and likewise had brought a
lump into my throat

  nay not that o jarl from of old
but-i never knew a father

  nor i a fair daughter i choked
and thereafter when that mood was
upon her i indulged in no more ironies
and wed sit for hours neither speaking
engrossed in thoughts for which there are
no words but on the night whereof i
write she pressed her scarlet lips to my
cheek and i asked jestingly

  is there sometiiing you want hel-
dra

  there is she replied gravely will
you get a boat-one with oars and a sail
but no engine ran hates those

  but surely you do not want it now
tonight do you

  yes if you will be so kind to me
you must have a very good reason or
youd not ask i said ill go and get a
centerboard dory and bring it to the beach
at the foot of the cliff path its clear
weather and the sea is calm with but a
moderate breeze blowing yet it is colder
on the water than you imagine so youd
best bundle up warmly

  you will hasten she implored anx-
iously

  surely i nodded

  i went out and down to the wharves in
the village where i kept the boat i said
the sea-witch



id get but when i beached the dory at
foot of the path i stared swearing softly
under my breath not one stitch of ap-
parel did that witch have on save the
crimson silk robe and black sash shed
worn when i left the cottage

  do you want to freeze i wras pro-
voked i admit the very sight of you
dressed like that gives me the shivers
neither you nor i will be cold this
night she laughed isnt it glorious
and this is a good boat you brought
please let me sail it and ask me no ques-
tions

  she took the tiller hauled in on the
sheet the sail filled and she began sing-
ing with a queer wild strain running
through her song that dory fairly flew
-and i swear there was not enough wind
to drive us at such speed

  finally i saw something i didnt ad-
mire no one does who dwells on that
part of the coast

  are you crazy girl i demanded
sharply that reef is dead ahead cant
you see the breakers

  why so it is-the reef and am i
to be affrighted by a few puny breakers
nay it is in the heart of those breakers
that i wish to be but you-have you
fear o jarl wulf

  i suspected from her tone that the
witch was laughing at me so i subsided
but fervently wished that id not been so
indulgent of her whim for a moonlight
sail on a cold winters night

  then we hit those breakers-or rather
we didnt for they seemed to part as
the racing dory sped into them making a
smooth clear lane of silvery glinting wa-
ter over which we glided as easily as if
on a calm inland mill-pond

  drop the sail and unstep the mast
she called suddenly

  i was beyond argument and obeyed
dumbly like any boat-carle of the olden
days

  now take to the oars she directed
and hold the boat just hereabouts for a
while and even as i slid the oars into
the oarlocks she made that swift move-
ment of hers and stood nude the loveliest
sight that grim ship-shattering life-de-
stroying reef had ever beheld

  suddenly she flung up both shapely
white arms with a shrill piercing cry
thrice repeated then without a word
she went overside in a long clean dive
with never a splash to show where shed
hit the water

  hold tjie boat about here for a
while shed bidden me all id ever
loved in this world was somewhere down
below in the hellish cross-currents of that
icy water id hold that boat there if
need were in the teeth of a worse tempest
than raged the night she came to me
shed find me waiting and if she never
came up id hold that boat there till its
planks rotted and i joined her in the
frigid depths

  it seemed an eternity and i know that
it was an hour ere a glimmer of white
appeared beneath the surface then her
shapely arm emerged and her hand
grasped the gunwale her regal head
broke water she blew like a porpoise
then she laughed in clear ringing tri-
umph

  you old dearling she cried in her
ardiaic norse did i seem long gone
the boat has not moved a foot from
where i dove come bear a hand and
lift my burden it is heavy and i am near
spent there are handles by whidi to
grasp it

  the burden proved to be a greenish
metal coffer-bronze i judged-which i
estimated to measure some twenty inches
long by twelve wide and nine inches
deep and how she rose to the surface
weighted with that passes my under-
standing but how she knew it was down
there passes my comprehension too but


weird tales

then heldra helstrom herself was an
enigma

  she re-wrapped herself in her flimsy
silken robe of crimson and smiled hap-
pily when she should have been shiver-
ing almost to pieces

  if youll ship the mast and spread the
sail again uncle john she said surpriz-
ingly matter-of-fact now that her errand
was successfully accomplished well go
home id like a glass of brandy and a
smoke myself and i read in your mind
that such is your chief desire at present

back at the cottage again and com-
fortable once more heldra requested
me to bear the coffer into her room
which i did for over an hour she re-
mained in there then returned to the
living-room where i sat and i stared at
the picture she presented if she had
always been beautiful now she was sur-
passingly glorious

  instead of the usual crimson robe her
lovely body was sheathed in a sleeveless
sheer tightly fitting silken slip cut at the
throat in a long sloping v reaching nearly
to her waist the garment was palest sea-
green so flimsy in texture that it might
as well have been compounded of min-
gled moon-mist and cobwebs her rosy-
pearl flesh gleamed through the fabric
with an alluring shimmer which thrilled
anew my jaded old senses at the artistic
wonder of her

  a gold collar gem-studded unmistak-
ably of ancient egyptian workmanship
was resting on her superb shoulders-loot
of some viking foray into the far south-
lands doubtless a broad girdle of gold
plates squared and also gem-studded
was about her sloping hips and was
clasped in front by a broader plate with
a sun-emblem in jeweled sets from
which plate or buckle it fell in tvo broad
bands nearly to her white slender feet

  broad torques of gold on upper arms

and about her wrists and an intricately
wrought golden tiara with disks of en-
graved gold pendent by chains and hang-
ing over her ears set off her loveliness as
never before even her red-gold hair
braided in two thick ropes falling over
her breasts to below her waist were
clasped by gem-set brooches of gold

  ragnar wave-flames gift to me o
jarl wulf she breathed softly do you
like your niece thus arrayed

  norse princess out of an elder day or
norse witch from an even older and
wickeder period of the world-whichever
this heldra helstrom was of one thing
i was certain no lovelier woman ever
lived than this superb being who styled
herself my niece

  and so i told her and was amply re-
warded by the radiance of her smile and
the ecstatic kiss she implanted on my
cheek

  despite her splendid array she perched
on the arm of my chair and began toying
with my left hand presently she lifted
it to the level of my eyes laughing soft-
ly id felt nothing yet shed slipped a
broad tarnished silver ring of antique de-
sign on my third finger

  it was yours in the ancient days o
jarl wulf she whispered in her favorite
tongue-the archaic form of the norsk
language yours again is the ancient
ring now ragnar herself carved the
mystic runes upon it shall i read them

o	jarl or will you

  they are beyond my skill i con-
fessed the words are in the secret
language that only the rjme-kanaars
understood nor was it well for others
than witches and warlocks to seek to un-
derstand them

  ragnar took that ring from jarl
wulfs finger ere she set fire to the
dragon-ship heldra murmured had
those runes been on the ring when your
foes set upon you-they not you would
the sea-witch



have perished in the sword-play jarl
red-sword

  but the sea-born witdi knew that you
would weary of valhalla in a day to
come and would return to this world of
strife and slaying of loss and grief of
hate and the glutting of vengeance-and
knowing she carved the runes that in
time the charmed ring would return to
its proper owner

  it is her express command that i read
them to you for knowing the runes
never shall water drown or fire burn nor
sword or spear or ax ever wound you
so be it that in time of danger you speak
the weird words

  and for my sake-you who are my
uncle john to all the rest of the world
but to me are dearer than old jarl wulf
was to ragnar the sea-witch-i implore
you to learn the runic charm and use it
if ever danger menaces promise me
promise me i say

  her silvery voice was vibrant with
fierce intensity she caught my right hand
and pressed it against her palpitant body
just beneath her proudly swelling left
breast

  promise she reiterated i beg your
promise with your right hand on my
heart i adjure you to learn the rune
no fool like an old fool i grum-
bled adding a trifle maliciously particu-
larly when in the hands of a lovely wo-
man but such a fuss you make over a few
words of outlandish gibberish read me
the rune then witch-maid id learn
words worse than those can be to please
you and set your mind at rest

  with her scarlet lips close to my ear
with bated breath and in a tone so low i
could barely catch her carefully enunci-
ated syllables she whispered the words
and although her whisper was softer
than the sighing of gentlest summer
breeze the tones rang on my inner hear-
ing like strokes of a great war-hammer

smiting on a shield of bronze there
was no need to repeat them-either on
her part or mine there was no likeli-
hood of my ever forgetting that runic
diarm i could not even if i would

  surely i muttered you are an
adept in the ancient magic well for me
that you love me else your witcheries

might-

  most amazingly she laughed a clear
ringing merriment with no trace of the
mystic about it

  let me show you something-a game
a play one that will amuse me and en-
tertain you

  she fairly danced across the room and
into her own room emerging with an an-
tique mirror of some burnished silver-
like metal this she held out to me i
grasped it by its handle obediently
enough humoring this new whim

  look into it and say if it is a good
mirror she bade her sapphire eyes
a-dance with elfin mirth

  i looked all i could see was my same
old face tanned and wrinkled which i
daily saw whenever i shaved or combed my
hair and i told her so she perched again
on the arm of my chair laid her cheek
against mine and curved her cool arm
about my neck

  now look again

  again the mirror told truth i saw my
face the same as ever and hers as well
like a rose beside a granite boulder as
i assured her

  you do but see yourself as you think
of yourself she murmured softly and
me you behold as you believe me to be

she brought her lips close to the mir-
ror and breathed upon its surface with
her warm breath it clouded over then
cleared her voice came more murmur-
ous than before but with a definite note
of sadness

  once more look behold yourself as


weird tales

i see you always and behold me as i
know myself to be and when i am gone
beyond your ken remember the witch-
maid heldra as one woman who loved
you so truly that she showed you herself
as she actually was

  the mans face was still my own but
mine as it was in the days of early man-
hood ere lifes thunders had graven their
scars on brow and cheeks and lips and
before the snows of many winters had
whitened my hair

  her features were no less beautiful
but in her reflected eyes i saw ages and
ages of life and bitter experience and
terrible wisdom that was far more wicked
than holy and it came to me with convic-
tion irrefutable that beside this young-
appearing girl maid or woman all my
years were but as the span of a puling
babe compared to the ageless age of an
immortal

   that at least is no glamyr her voice
sighed drearily heavy with the burden of
her own knowledge of herself

  i laid my thick heavy old arm across
her smooth satiny white shoulders and i
turned her head until her sapphire eyes
met mine fairly very gently i kissed
her on her brow

  heldra helstrom i said and my
voice sounded husky with emotion you
may be all you have just shown me or
worse you may be ragnar wave-flame
herself the sea-witch who never dies
you may be even what i sometimes sus-
pect the empress of hell come amongst
mortals for no good purpose but be you
what you may old or young maid or
woman good or evil witch spirit angel
or she-devil such as you are you are you
and i am i and for some weird reason
we seem to love each other in our own
way so let there be an end to what
you are or have been or who i was in
other lives and content ourselves with
what is

  were those bright glitters in her sap-
phire eyes tear-drops ready to fall if so
i was not sure for with a cry like that
of a lost soul who has found sanctuary
she buried her face on my shoulder   

  after a long silence she slipped from
the arm of my chair and wordlessly her
face averted she passed into her room
after an hour or so i went to my own
room-but i could not sleep   

time passed and i dwelt in a fools
paradise dreaming that it would
last for ever

  the summer colony began to arrive
there were cottages all along the shore
but there were likewise big estates whose
owners were rated as somebodies to
put it mildly

  a governor of a great and sovereign
state an ex-president of our nation sev-
eral foreign diplomats and some of their
legation attaches-but why enumerate
when one man only concerns this narra-
tive

  michael commnenus tall slight dap-
per inclined to swarthiness with black
eyes under crescent-curved black eye-
brows with supercilious smiling lips a
trifle too red for a man with suave old
world manners and a most amazingly
conceited opinion of himself as a lady-
charmer

  it was not his first summer in our
midst and although when he was in
washington at his legation i never gave
him a thought when i saw his too hand-
some face on the beach i felt a trifle sick
i knew positively that the minute he set
eyes on heldra  of course i knew
too that my witch-niece could take care
of herself but just the same i sensed
annoyance and perhaps tragedy

  well i was in nowise mistaken

  heldra and i were just about to shove
off in my dory for a sail it was her chief
delight and mine too for that matter
the sea-witch



  casually along strolled michael comm-
nenus twirling a slender stick caressing
a slender black thread he styled a mus-
tache smiling his approbation of him-
self id seen that variety of casual ap-
proach before as our flippant young
moderns say it was old stuff

  out of the corner of my eye i watched
the don juan smirk faded when his cal-
culating appraising eyes met her sapphire
orbs now shining like the never-melting
polar ice an expression of bewilder-
ment spread over his features his
swarthy skin went a sickly greenish-
bronze involuntarily he crossed himself
and passed on the man was afraid actu-
ally fear-struck

  ever see him before heldra i que-
ried he looked at you as if the devil
would be a pleasanter sight thats one
man who failed to fall for your vivid
beauty you sea-witch

  who is he she asked in a peculiar
tone i liked his looks even less than he
liked mine

  michael commnenus i informed
her and was about to give her his pedi-
gree as we local people knew him but
was interrupted by her violently explo-
sive

  who

  michael commnenus i stated again
a trifle testily and you neednt shout
whats he done- but again she in-
terrupted speaking her archaic norsk
ho varang chiefs of the guard
imperial thorfinn arvid sven and
ye who followed them-gudrun rand-
var haakon smid and all ye varangs
in valhalla give ear and ye o fiends
witches warlocks trolls vampyrs and all
the dark gods who dwell in hels halls
wrhere the eternal frozen fires blaze with-
out heat give ear to my voice and cher-
ish my words for i give ye all joyous
tidings

  he lives after all these long centu-

ries michael commnenus dwells again on
the bosom of fair earth in a body of
flesh and blood and bone of nerve and
tissue and muscle he lives he lives i
say and i have found him

  oh now i know why the norns who
rule all fate sent me to this place and
i shall not fail ye heroes content ye
one and all i shall not jail

  was this the gorgeous beauty id
learned to love for her gentleness hers
was the face of a furious female demon
for a moment but then her normal ex-
pression returned and she sighed heavily

  heed me not uncle john she said
drearily i did but recall an ancient tale
of foul treachery perpetrated on sundry
norsemen in the varangian guard of a
byzantine emperor ages agone

  the niddering-worse than coward
-who wrought the bane of some thirty-
odd vikings was a commnenus nephew
to the emperor alexander commne-
nus  i live too much in memories
of the past i fear and for the moment
somewhat forgot myself in the hate all
good norse maids should hold toward
any who bear the accursed name of the
commneni

  still even as i know you to be old
jarl wulf red-brand returned to this
world through the gateway of birth-it
would be nothing surprizing if this
spawn of the commneni were in truth
that same michael commnenus of whom
the tale is told

  the belief in reincarnation is age-
old i said reflectively and in several
parts of the world it is a fundamental
tenet of religion if there be truth in the
idea there is as you say nothing sur-
prizing if anybody now living should
have been anybody else in some former
life    and that sample of the comm-
ncni appears quite capable of any treach-
ery that might serve a purpose at the mo-
ment but heldra i implored her


weird tales

struck by a sudden intuition i beg of
you not to indulge in any of your devil-
ries witcheries or norse magic if this
michael is that other michael yet that
was long ago and if he has not already
atoned for his sin you may be very sure
that somewhere sometime somehow he
will atone so do not worry your regal
head about him

  spoken like a right saga-man she
smiled as i finished my brief homily i
thank you for your words of wisdom
and now jarl wulf red-brand i know
you to be fey as well as i am surely
he will atone for his sin  oh a most
comforting thought so let us think no
more about the matter

  i glanced sharply at her her too in-
stant acquiescence was suspicious but
her sapphire eyes met mine fairly smil-
ingly sending as always a warm glow of
contentment through me so i accepted
her assurance as it sounded and gave
myself up to the enjoyment of the sail
and the sound of her silvery voice as she
sang an old english love ballad id
known as a young man and under the
spell of her magnetic personality gradu-
ally the episode of michael commnenus
faded into nothingness-for a while

a couple of days later just about
dark heldra came down the stairs
from the attic where shed been rum-
maging in her hand she carried an old
violin-case i looked and grinned rue-
fully

  you are a bad old uncle john she
scolded why did you not tell me you
played the fidel even as jarl wulf
played one in his time think of all the
sweet music you might have made in the
past winter nights and think of the
dances i might have danced for your de-
light while you played-even as ragnar
danced for her old jarl

  but i did not tell you that i played a

fiddle-because i dont i stated flatly
that is a memento of an absurd ambi-
tion i once cherished but which died
a-borning i tried to learn the thing but
the noises i extracted were so abominable
that i quit before id fairly got started
you are teasing she retorted her
eyes sparkling with mischief but i am
not to be put off thus easily tonight
you will play and i will dance-such a
dance as you have never beheld even
when you were jarl wulf

  if i try to play that thing i assured
her seriously youll have a time dancing
to my discords you gorgeous tease
well see she nodded but even
as my magic revealed to me the where-
abouts of the fidel so my spirit tells me
that you play splendidly

  your magic may be all right but
your spirit has certainly misinformed
you i growled

  my spirit has never yet lied to me-
nor has it done so this time her tone
was grave yet therein was a lurking
mockery and i became a trifle provoked

  all right i assented grouchily
whenever you feel like hearing me
fplay ill do it and youll never want
to listen to such noises again

  she went into her room laughing
sweetly and took the fiddle with her

  after supper she said nothing about
me playing that old fiddle and i fatu-
ously thought shed let the matter drop
but about ten oclock she went to her
room without a word she emerged after
a bit wearing naught but a sheer loose
palest blue silk robe held at the waist
only by a tiny jeweled gold filigree clasp
loose as the robe was it clung lovingly
to her every curve as if caressing the
beauteous statuesque body it could not
and would not conceal

  she was totally devoid of all ornament
save that tiny brooch and her wondrous
fiery-gold hair was wholly unconfined
the sea-witch



falling below her waist in a cascade of
shimmering sunset hues against which
her rose-pearl body gleamed through the
filmy gossamer-like robe

  again she sat and talked for a while
but along toward midnight she broke a
short silence with

  ill be back in a minute i wish to
prepare for my dancing

  from her room she brought four an-
tique bronze lamps and a strangely
shaped urn of oil she filled the lamps
and placed one at each corner of the liv-
ing-room on the floor

  back into her room she went and out
again with an octagonal-shaped stone
flat on both sides about an inch thick
and some four inches across this she
placed on the low taboret whereon i usu-
ally kept my nargilyeh she propped up
that slab of stone as if placing a mirror-
which i decided it couldnt very well be
as it did not even reflect light but seemed
as dull as a slab of slate

  as a final touch she brought out that
confounded old fiddle and on her scar-
let lips was a smile that a seraph might
have envied so innocent and devoid of
guile it seemed

  whats this i demanded-as if i
didnt know

  your little jidel with which you will
make for your heldra such rapturous
music she smiled caressingly

  um-m-m-m i grunted and what
arc those lamps for-and that ugly slab
of black rock

  that black slab is a hel-stone hav-
ing the property of reflecting whatever is
directly before it if illumined by those
four lamps placed at certain angles and
later it will give olr those same reflections
-even as the stuff called luminous cal-
cium sulfide absorbs light-rays until sur-
charged and then emits them when

properly exposed so you see we can
preserve the picture of my dance

  heldra i demanded sharply are
you up to some devilishness all this
looks amazingly like the stage-setting for
witch-working

  i have sung for you on different
nights she replied in gentlest reproach
and have told old tales and have attired
myself again and again for your pleasure
in beholding me have all these things
ever bewitched you or harmed anyone
how then can the fact of my dancing
for my own satisfaction before the mys-
tic hel-stone do any harm

as ever she won her sapphire orbs
k did queer things to me whenever
they looked into my own gray faded old
eyes-trusting me to understand and ap-
prove whatever she did simply because
she was she and i was i

  all right i said but youre mak-
ing a fool of me-insisting that i play
this old fiddle well-ill teach you a
lesson and i drew the bow over the
strings with a most appalling wail

  and with the unexpected swiftness of
a steel trap closing on its victim icy fin-
gers locked about my wrist and i knew
very definitely that another and alien per-
sonality was guiding my arm and fingers
but there came likewise a swift certitude
that if i behaved no harm would ensue
-to me at least so i let the thing have
its way-and listened to such music as i
had not believed could be played on any
instrument devised by a mortal

  i wish that i could describe that music
but i do not know the right words
i doubt if they have been invented it
was wild barbaric savage but likewise it
was alluring seductive stealing away all
inhibitions-too much of it would have
corrupted the angels in heaven i was
almost in a stupor intoxicated like a
hasheesh-catc-r in a drugged dream spell-


weird tales

bound unable to break from the thrall-
dom holding my will drowning in rap-
ture well-nigh unbearable

  heldra suddenly blew out the big kero-
sene lamp standing on the table leaving
as sole illumination the rays from those
four bronze lights standing in the cor-
ners

  her superb body moved gracefully
slowly at first then faster into the intri-
cate figure and pattern of a dance that
was old when the wrorld was young   

  with inward horror i knew the why
and wherefore of that entire ceremonial
knew id been be-cozened and be-japed
yet knew likewise that it was too late for
interference i could not even speak i
could but watch while some personality
alien to my body played maddeningly on
my fiddle and the niece i loved danced
a dance deliberately planned to seduce a
man who hated and feared the dancer-
and for what devilish purpose i could
well guess

  i saw the light-rays converge on her
alluring statuesque body saw them ap-
parently pass through her and impinge
on the surface of that black sullen oc-
tagonal hel-stone and be greedily swal-
lowed up until the dull black surface
glowed like a rare black australian opal
and ever the dancing of the witch-girl
grew more alluring more seductive more
abandoned and i knew why heldra was
thus shamefully-shamelessly rather-
conducting she had read michael comm-
nenus his character very accurately knew
that his soul had recognized her hatred
for him and feared her-and that her
one chance to get him in her clutches lay
in inflaming his senses    and shed even
told me the properties of that most damn-
able hel-stone

  wilder and faster came the music and
svifter and still more alluring grew the
rhythmic response as heldras lovely body
swayed and spun and swooped and pos-

tured until ultimately her waving arms
brought her fluttering hands in the brief-
est of touches into contact with the tiny
brooch at her waist and the filmy robe
was swept away in a single gesture that
was faithfully recorded on the sullen sur-
face of the hel-stone

   instantly the dancer stopped as if petri-
fied her arms outstretched as in invita-
tion her regal head thrown back show-
ing the long smooth white column of her
throat her clear half-closed sapphire-
blue eyes agleam with subtle chal-
lenge   

  the uncanny music died in a sin-
gle sighing sobbing whisper poison-
sweet    the clutching icy fingers were
gone from my wrist my first coherent
thought was had that spell been di-
rected at me the old adage anent old
fools would have been swiftly justified

  and i knew that to all intents and
purposes michael commnenus was sunk

  just the same i was furious heldra
had gone too far and i told her so flatly
i pointed out in terms unmistakable that
what she planned was murder or worse
and that this was modern america where-
in witchcraft had neither place nor sanc-
tion and that id be no accessory to any
such devilishness as she was contriving
oh i made myself and my meaning
plain

  and she stood and looked at me with
a most injured expression she made me
feel as if id wantonly struck a child
across the face in the midst of its innocent
diversions

   i dont actually care if the devil flies
off with michael commnenus i con-
cluded wrathfully but i wont have him
murdered by you while youre living
here posing as my niece no doubt its
quite possible for you to evade any legal
consequences by disappearing but what
of me as accessory id be liable to life
imprisonment at the least

the sea-witch



  her face lightened as by magic and
her voice was genuinely regretful and in
her eyes was a light of sincere love she
came to me and wrapped her white arms
about my neck murmuring terms of af-
fectionate consolation

  poor dear uncle john heldra was
thoughtless-wicked me and i might
have involved you in serious trouble i
am ashamed but the fate laid upon me
by the norns is heavy and i may not
evade it even for you whom i love
tell me she demanded suddenly if i
should destroy the vile earthworm with-
out any suspicion attaching to you or to
me would you love me as before even
knowing what i had done

  no i fairly snarled the denial i
wanted it to be emphatic

  she smiled serenely and kissed me
full on my lips

  i never thought to thank a mortal for
lying to me but now i do deep in your
heart i can read your true feeling and i
am glad but now-and her tone took
on a sadness most desolate-i regret to
say that on the morrow i leave you the
lovely garments you gave me and the
trunks containing them i take with me
as you would not wish that i go empty-
handed nor will i insult you o jarl
wulf by talk of payment

  when i am gone you will just
casually mention that i have returned to
my home and the local gossips will not
suspect aught untoward and soon i shall
be forgotten and no one will suspect or
possibly connect you or me with what
inevitably must happen to that spawn
of the commneni

  but of this be very sure somewhere
sometime you and i shall be together
again   her voice broke she kissed
me fiercely on the lips then tenderly on
both cheeks then lastly with a queer rev-
erence on my furrowed old brow then
she turned went straight to her room
w t-

shut the door and i heard the click of
the key as she locked herself in for the
first time during her stay in my house   

  next morning as shed planned she
departed on the first train cityward id
given her money enough for all her re-
quirements-more indeed than she was
willing to take at first declaring that she
intended selling some few of her jewels

  and with her departure went all which
made life worth living   

heavily i dragged my reluctant feet
back to the empty shell of a cottage
which until then had been an earthly
paradise to an old man-and the very
first thing i laid eyes on was that ac-
cursed hel-stone lying on the living-
room table

  i picked it up half minded to shatter
it to fragments but an idea seized me
i bore it down-cellar where semi-dark-
ness prevailed and the hel-stone glowed
softly with its witch-light showing me
the loveliness of her who had departed
from me and i pressed the cold octagon
to my lips thankful that shed left me
the tiling as a feeble substitute for her
presence then i turned and went back
upstairs found an old ivory box of
chinese workmanship and placed the
hel-stone therein very carefully as a
thing priceless

  i went to bed early that night there
was no reason to sit up but i could not
sleep i lay there in my bed cursing the
entire line of commneni root trunk and
branch from the first of that ilk whom
history records to this latest scion or
spawn as heldra had termed him

  around midnight being still wakeful
i arose got the hel-stone and sat in the
darkness-and gradually became aware
that i was not alone looking up i saw
her id lost standing in a witch-glow of
phosphorescent light i knew at once
that it was not heldra in person but


weird tales

her scin-lacca or shining double a
sending and that it was another of her
witcheries

  but even this is welcome i thought
then i felt her thought expressed
through that phantasmal semblance of
her own gorgeous self-and promptly
strove angrily to resist her command
much good it did me

  utterly helpless yet fully cognizant of
my actions but oddly assured that about
me was a cloak of invisibility-the
uglamyr of the ancient alrunas - i
dresssed took the hel-stone and passed
out into the night

  straight to the cottage of commnenus
i went pawed about under the door-step
and planted there the hel-stone then
still secure in the mystic glamor i re-
turned to my own abode

  and no sooner had i seated myself in
my chair for a smoke than i realized
fully the utter devilishness of that witch
from out the wintry seas whom i had
taken into my home and had sponsored
as my niece in the eyes of the world

  right then i decided to go back and
get that hel-stone and smash it-and
couldnt do it i got sleepy so suddenly
that i awoke to find that it was broad
daylight and nine-thirty a m and from
then on as regularly as twilight came i
could only stay awake so long as i kept
my thoughts away from that accursed
hel-stone wherefore i determined that
the thing could stay where it was until
it rotted for all me

  then commnenus came along the
beach late one afternoon he raised his
hat in his old world courtly fashion
and tried to make some small talk i
grunted churlishly and ignored him but
finally he came out bluntly with

  professor craig i know your opinion
of me and admit it is to some extent
justifiable i seem to have acquired the
reputation of being a don juan but i

ask you to believe that i bitterly regret
that-now yet despite that reputation
id like to ask you a most natural ques-
tion if i may

  i nodded assent unprepared for what
was coming yet somehow assured it
would concern heldra nor was i at all
disappointed for he fairly blurted out
when do you expect miss helstrom
to return if at all

  i was flabbergasted that is the only
word adequate i glared at him in a
black fury when i could catch my breath
i demanded

  how did even you summon up the
infernal gall to ask me that

  his reply finished flattening me out
because i love her wait-he
begged-and hear me out please even
a criminal is allowed that courtesy then
as i nodded grudgingly he resumed
the first time i saw her something
deep within me shrank away from her
with repulsion still i admired her
matchless beauty but of late since her
departure there is not a night i do not
see her in my minds eye and i know
that i love her and hope that she will
return hence my query

  i will be frank-i even hope that she
noticed me and read my admiration with-
out dislike perhaps two minds can reach
each other-sometimes for invariably i
see her with head thrown back her eyes
half closed and her arms held out as if
calling me to come to her and if i knew
her whereabouts id most certainly go
nor would i be trifling where she is
concerned i want to win her if possible
as my wife and an emperor should be

proud to call her that-

  very romantic i sneered but mr
woman-chaser i cut my eye-teeth a long
while before you were born and im not
so easily taken in the whereabouts of
my niece are no concern of yours so
get away from me before i lose my

temper or ill not be answerable for my
actions get

  he went the expression of my face
and the rage in my eyes must have
warned him that i was in a killing
humor well i was but likewise i was
sick with fear what hed just told me
was sufficient to sicken me-the hel-
stone had gotten in its damnable work
my very soul was aghast as it envisioned
the inevitable consequences   

an idea obsessed me and i needed the
 shades of night to cloak my
purpose

  aimlessly i wandered from room to
room in my cottage and finally drifted
into the room which had been heldras
still aimlessly i pulled open drawer after
drawer in the dresser and in the lowest
one i heard a faint metallic clink

  the four antique bronze lamps were
there i shrewdly suspected she had left
them there as means of establishing con-
tact with her should need arise i ex-
amined them and found as id hoped
that they were filled

  around ten oclock i placed those
lamps in the four corners of the living-
room and lighted them precisely as id
seen heldra do then i tried my talents
at making an invocation

  heldra heldra heldra i called
i john craig who gave you shelter at
your need call to you now wheresoever
you be to come to me at my need

  the four lights went out yet not a
breath of air stirred in the room a faint-
ly luminous glow the witch-light en-
sued and there she stood or rather the
jcin-lcecca her shining double but i
knew that anything i might say to it
would be the same as if she were there
in the flesh

  heldra i beseeched that witch-
lighted simulacrum by the love you
gave me as ragnar loved jarl wulf red-

sword i ask that you again enshroud me
with the mantle of invisibility the
fglamyr and allow me to lift that ac-
cursed hel-stone from where you com-
pelled me to conceal it let me return
it to you at any place you may appoint
so that it can do no more harm

  already that poor bewitched fool is
madly in love with you because the radi-
ations of that enchanted stone have sat-
urated him every time he put foot on the
door-step beneath which i buried it

  heldra grant me this one kindness
and i will condone all sins you ever did
in all your witch-life

  the shining wraith nodded slowly un-
mistakably assenting to my request as
from a far distance i heard a faint
whisper

  since it is your desire get the hel-
stone and bear it yourself to the sea-
cave at the foot of the great cliff guard-
ing the north passage into the harbor
once you have borne it there its work
and yours are done

  and i thank you for saying that you
will condone all i have ever done for
the burden of the past is heavy and your
words have made it easier to bear

  the shining wraith vanished and i
went forth into the darkness straight to
the house where id hidden the hel-stone
i betook myself felt under the step
found what i sought took it with an in-
ward prayer of gratitude that because of
heldras glamyr i had not been caught
at something questionable in appearance
and started up the beach

  the tide was nearly out so i walked
rapidly as i had some distance to go and
the sea-cave heldra had designated could
not be entered at high tide although once
within one was safe enough and could
leave when the entrance was once more
exposed

  i entered the cave believing that id
promptly be rid of the entire mess once


weird tales

and for all but there was no one there
and the interior of the cave was as dark
as erebus i lit a match and saw nothing
the match burned out i fumbled for
another-a dazzling ray from a flashlight
blinded me for a moment then left my
face and swept the cave a hated voice
suave yet menacing said

  well professor craig you may now
hand me whatever it was that you pur-
loined from under my door-step

  an extremely business-like automatic
pistol was aimed in the exact direction of
my solar plexus-and the speaker was
none other than michael commnenus

  very evidently the mystic glamyr
had failed to work that time and i was
in a rather nasty predicament

  then abruptly heldra came she
looked like an avenging fury emerging
out of nowhere apparently and the
tables were turned she wore a dark
cloak or long mantle draped over her
head and falling to her feet

  her right hand was outstretched and
with her left hand she seized the hel-
stone from my grasp she pointed one
finger at commnenus and did not even
touch him yet had she smote with an
ancient war-hammer the effect would
have been the same

  you dog and son of a long line of
dogs her icy voice rang with excoriat-
ing virulence drop that silly pistol
drop it i say

  a faint blue flicker snapped from her
extended finger-the pistol fell from a
flaccid hand commnenus seemed totally
paralyzed heldras magic held him
completely in thralldom  i snapped
into activity and scooped up the gun
followed me did you i snarled

til-

  wait jarl wulf heldras tone was
frankly amused no need for you to do
aught mine is the blood-feud mine the
blood-right and ere i finish with yon

michael commnenus an ancient hate
will be surfeited and an ancient ven-
geance too long delayed will be consum-
mated

  heldra i began for dread seized
me at the ominous quality of her words
i will not stand for this affair going

any farther i-

  be silent seat yourself over there
against the wall and watch and hear but
move not nor speak again lest i silence
you for ever

  a force irresistible hurled me across
the cave and set me down hard on a
flat rock i realized fully that i was obey-
ing her mandate-i couldnt speak
couldnt even move my eyelids so thor-
oughly had she inhibited any further in-
terference on my part

paying no further attention to com-
mnenus for the moment she crossed
over to me bent and kissed me on my
lips her sapphire eyes laughing into my
own blazing wrathful eyes

  poor dear it is too bad but you
made me do it i wanted you to help
me all the way through this tangled coil
-but you have been so difficult to man-
age yet in some ways you have played
into my hands splendidly yes even to
bringing the hel-stone back to me-and
i would not care to lose that for a kings
ransom and i put it into yon fools
head to be wakeful tonight and see you
regain the hel-stone and follow you-
and thus walk into my nice little trap
and now

  she whirled and faced commnenus
and for all that he was spellbound in
his eyes i read fear and a ghastly fore-
knowledge of some dreadful fate about
to be meted out to him at her hands

  she picked up the flashlight he had
dropped and extinguished it with the
dry comment

  we need a different light here-the
the sea-witch



hel-light from helas halls and at
her word a most peculiar light pervaded
the cave and there was that about its
luminance that actually affrighted again
she spoke

  michael commnenus you utterly vile
worm of the earth you know that your
doom is upon you-but as yet you know
not why o beast lower than the swine
harken and remember my words even
after eternity is swallowed up in the twi-
light of the gods you are a modern
and know not that the self the soul is
eternal undying changing its body and
name in every clime and period yet ever
the same soul responsible for the deeds
of its bodies you have even prated of
your soul-when in fact you are the
property of the soul

  watch now she pointed to the
cave entrance behold there the wisps
of sea-fog gathering and gradually will
come the rising tide and on the cur-
tain of that cold swirling mist behold
the pictures of the past-a past centuries
old a past wherein your craven treacher-
ous soul sinned beyond all pardon

  look you too jarl wulf red-brand
so that in all the days remaining to you
upon earth you may know that his doom
was just and that heldra is but execut-
ing a merited penalty

  and while the shuttles of the norm
weave the tapestry of the sin of this com-
mnenus i will tell all the tale of his
crimes

  in byzantium reigned the emperor
alexander commnenus secure his
throne guarded by the ponderous axes
and the long swords of the varangians
the splendid sons of the norse-lands
who had gone a-viking trusted and
loved were the varangs by the emperor
and oft he boasted of their fidelity
swearing on the cross of constantine that
to the last man would his varangs perish
ere one would flinch a step from over-

whelming foes citing itl proof their
battle-cry

  ff valhalla valhalla victory or val-
halla

  into the harbor of the golden horn
sailed the viking long-ship the grettir
three noble brothers owned her-thor-
finn arvid sven with them sailed
their sister    her fame as an alruna-
maid prophetess and priestess was sung
throughout the norse-lands no man so
low but bore her reverence sin it was to
cast eyes of desire on any alruna and the
sister of the three brothers was held
especially holy

  between the hands of the emperor
alexander commnenus the three breth-
ren placed their hands- swearing fealty
for a year and a day thirty fighting-men
their crew followed wherever the three
brothers led and the great emperor
hearing of their war-fame from others of
the varangian guard gave the brothers
high place in his esteem and held them
nigh his own person

  their sister the alruna-maid was
treated as became her rank and holy
repute aye even in christian byzan-
tium respect and honor were shown her
by the priests of an alien belief but one
man in byzantium aspired more greatly
than any other norseman or byzantine
had ever dared

  a commnenus he grand admiral of
byzantiums war fleet nephew to the em-
peror enjoying to the full the confidence
and love of his imperial uncle notorious
for his profligacy he cast his libertine
eyes on the norse alruna-maid but with
no thought of making her his wife nay
twas only as his leman he desired her
   so he plotted   

  the three brothers thorfinn arvid
sven with their full crew in the long-
ship grettir were ordered to sea to cruise
against certain pirates harrying a portion
of the emperors coasts


weird tales

  every man of the grettirs crew died
the deaths of rats-poison in the water-
casks    they died as no norseman
should die brutes deaths unfit for val-
halla and the company of heroes who had
passed in battle and their splendid
bodies warped and distorted by pangs
of the poison were cast overside as prey
for sharks by two creatures of this grand
admiral whom he had sent with the
three brothers as pilots knowing the
coast they placed the drug in the casks
they flung over the dead and dying they
ran the grettir aground and set fire to
her-but his was the command--and his
the crime

  and as heldra told the tale in a voice
whose dreary tones made the recital seem
even worse-the watching commnenus
and i saw clearly depicted on the curtain
of the mist each separate incident   
heldra turned to the wildly glaring
michael

  there was but one person in all
byzantium who knew the truth she
screamed in sudden frenzy i give back
for a moment your power of speech say

o	fool coward niddering who am i
abruptly she tore off the somber cloak
and stood in all her loveliness enhanced
by every ornament she once had worn for
my pleasure in beholding her thus ar-
rayed

a cry of unearthly terror broke from
the staring commnenus his voice
was a strangled croak as he gasped

  the alruna-maid heldra the red-
haired sea-witch-sister to the three
brothers thorfinn arvid sven

  aye you foul dog and me you took
at night after they sailed away and me
you shut up where my cries for aid could
not be heard and me you would have
despoiled-me the alruna-maid sworn
to chastity me you jeered at and reviled
boasting of your recent crimes against

all that the norse-folk hold most sacred

  yet i escaped from that last dreadful
dungeon wherein you immured me-
how

  by that magic known to such as i i
called upon the empress of the under-
world hela herself and pledged her my
service in return for indefinitely contin-
ued life until i could repay you and
avenge the heroes denied the joys of val-
halla-by you

  and now-comes swiftly the doom i
have planned for you    you who now
remember

  heldra spoke truly swiftly it came
sitting where i was i saw it plainly a
great dragon-ship with round shields dis-
played along her gunwales with a big
square sail of crimson embroidered in
gold with long oars dipping and lifting
in unison-in faint ghostly tones i could
hear the deep-sea rowers chanting juchf
hey sa-sa-sa hey-sa hey-sa hey-sa
hey-sa and knew it for the time-beat
rowing-song of the ancient vikings

  the whole picture was limned in the
cold sea-fires from whence that terrible
viking ghost-ship had risen with its crew
of long-dead norsemen who were not
dead-the men too good for hel and
denied valhalla   

  straight to the mouth of the cave came
the ghost-ship and its crew disembarked
and entered heldra cried out in joyous
welcome

  even from out of the deeps ye
heroes one and all have ye heard my
silent summons and obeyed the voice of
your alruna from old time now your
waiting is at an end

  yonder stands the commnenus that
other concerns ye not-but mark him
well for in a former life he was jarl
wulf red-brand see on his left hand
is still the old silver ring with its runes
of ragnar wave-flame

  the ghost-vikings turned their dead
the sea-witch



eyes on me with a curious fixity one and
all they saluted evidently jarl wulf
must have been somebody in his time
then ignoring me they turned to
heldra awaiting her further commands
commnenus they looked at fiercely
avidly

  heldra s voice came heavily solemnly
with a curious bell-like tone sounding the
knell of doom incarnate

  michael commnenus this your pres-
ent body has never wrought me harm
nor has it harmed any of these it is not
with your body that we hold our feud
wherefore your body shall go forth
from this cave as it entered-as hand-
some as ever bearing no mark of scathe

  but your niddering soul o most ac-
cursed shall be drawn from out its
earthly tenement this night and given
over to these souls you wronged who
now await their victim and their ven-
geance and i tell you michael com-
mnenus that what they have in store for
you will make the hades of your religion
seem as a devoutly-to-be-desired para-
dise

  heldra stepped directly before comm-
nenus her shapely white arms were out-
stretched palms down fingers stiffly ex-
tended a queer violet-tinged radiance
streamed from her fingers gradually en-
veloping commnenus-he began to
glow as if he had been immersed and
had absorbed all his body could take
up   

  heldras voice took on the tone of
finality

  michael commnenus thou accursed
soul by the power i hold given me by
helas self i call you forth from your
hiding-place of flesh-come ye out

  the living body never moved but
from out its mouth emerged a faint sil-
very-tinted vapor flowing toward the
alrutia-maid and as it came the violet
glow diminished the accumulating sil-

very mist swirled and writhed percep-
tibly taking on the semblance of the body
from whence it was being extracted
there remained finally but a merest
thread of silvery shimmer connecting
soul and body heldra spoke beneath her
breath

  one of you hew that cord asunder
a double-bladed norse battle-ax
whirled and a ghostly voice croaked
thor hulf

  thor the old norse war-god must
have helped for the great ghost-ax evi-
dently encountered a solid cable well-
nigh as strong as tempered steel thrice
the ax rose and fell driven by the swell-
ing thews of the towering giant wielding
it ere the silver cord was broken by the
blade

   a tittering giggle burst from the lips
of the present-day michael commnenus

  i realized with a sudden sickness at
the pit of my stomach that an utterly
mindless imbecile stood there grinning
vacuously

  that thing heldra said coldly
scornful as she pointed to the silvery
shining soul is yours heroes do with
it as ye will

  two of the gigantic wraiths clamped
their great hands on its shoulders it
turned a dull leaden-gray the color of
abject fear cringing and squirming it
was hustled aboard the ghostly dragon-
ship the other ghost-vikings went
aboard taking their places at the oars  
yet they waited heldra turned to me

   be free of the spell i laid upon you
her tone was as gentle as it had been in
her sweetest moments while she dwelt in
my home as my niece

i gasped rose and stretched i wanted
to be angry-and dared not id seen
too much of her hellish powers to risk
incurring her displeasure and reading
my mind she laughed merrily


weird tales

  then her cool soft white arms went
about my neck her wondrous sapphire
eyes looked long and tenderly into mine
-and i will not write the message i
read in those softly shining orbs once
again her silvery voice spoke

  jarl wulf red-brand john craig i
am the grand-daughter of ragnar wave-
flame and once i went a-viking with
my three brothers to far byzantium you
know that talc now once i said that
ragnar wave-flame never died also
i said that i had dived into her sea-cave
and lain in her arms-and now i tell you
the rest of that mystery with her breath
she entered this my body where ever
since we have dwelt as one soul i need-
ed aid in seeking my vengeance for it
was after id escaped the clutches of the
commnenus and had passed through ad-
ventures incredible while making my
way back to the norse-lands-and my
spirit was very bitter and when i
sought her council ragnar helped
me   

  this now do i ask of you do you
as i have sometimes thought love me as
a man loves a maid reflect well ere you
answer and recall what i once showed
you in a mirror-i am older than you
so knowing that despite my witcheries
of the long bitter past and those of to-
night would you take me were you and
i young once more

  by all the gods in valhalla and by
all the devils in helas halls yes my
reply was given without need of reflect-
ing or counting cost

  then in a day to come you shall take
me-i swear it

  full upon my mouth she pressed her
scarlet lips and a surging flame suffused
my entire body yet it was life-not

death against my chest i felt the pres-
sure of her swelling breasts and fires un-
dreamable streamed from her heart to
mine time itself stood still after an
eon or so she unwound her clinging arms
from about my neck and turned away
and with never a backward glance she
entered that waiting ghostly dragon-ship
the oars dipped   

  juch hey sa-sa-sa hey-sa hey-sa
hey-sa hey-sa and repeated    and
again    until the faint ghostly chant
was swallowed by distance   

   i left the cave

  the driveling idiot who had been
michael commnenus was already gone
later the gossip ran that hed lost his
mind and that his embassy had re-
turned him to his own land none ever
suspected or coupled me or my niece
with his affliction and he himself had
absolutely no memory-had lost even
his own name when his soul departed

  but within a month i sold my cottage
packed and stored all my belongings un-
til i could find a new location where id
be totally unknown and then i went
away from where i had dwelt for years-
and with urgent reason

  the fire with which heldra had im-
bued me from her breath and breast was
renewing my youth my hair was shades
darker my wrinkles almost gone my
step was brisker i looked to be nearer
forty than almost sixty so marked was
the change that the villagers stared open-
ly at what seemed at least a miracle   
tongues were wagging    old supersti-
tions were being revived and dark hints
were being bandied about  so i final-
ly decided to leave and go where my
altered appearance would cause no com-
ment

  i wonder if-

ows unwinking unchanging omnis-
cient in this little world of the dead

ane of the black a

           by robert bloch	

  terrible was the fame of nephren-ka and more terrible still was the
  destiny that captain cartaret read on the walls of the
  red- itten underground corridors

t iar said captain cartaret	forward into the lamplight he smiled

       the dark man did not move that is a harsh epithet effendi
but beneath the shadows of his purred the dark man
burnoose a scowl slithered across a con- captain cartaret stared at his midnight
torted countenance but when he stepped visitor with quizzical appraisal

                                                                                      


weird tales

  a deserved one i think he ob-
served consider the facts you come
to my door at midnight uninvited and
unknown you tell me some long rig-
marole about secret vaults below cairo
and then voluntarily offer to lead me
there

  that is correct assented the arab
blandly he met the glance of the schol-
arly captain calmly

  why should you do this pursued
cartaret if your story is true and you
do possess so manifestly absurd a secret
why should you come to me why not
claim the glory of discovery yourself

  i told you effendi said the arab
that is against the law of our brother-
hood it is not written that i should do
so and knowing of your interest in
these things i came to offer you the privi-
lege

  you came to pump me for my infor-
mation no doubt thats what you mean
retorted the captain acidly you beg-
gars have some devilishly clever ways of
getting underground information dont
you so far as i know youre here to
find out how much ive already learned
so that you and your fanatic thugs can
knife me if i know too much

  ah the dark stranger suddenly
leaned forward and peered into the white
mans face then you admit that what

i	tell you is not wholly strange-you do
know something of this place already
suppose i do said the captain un-
flinching that doesnt prove that
youre a philanthropic guide to what im
seeking more likely you want to pump
me as i said then dispose of me and
get the goods for yourself no your
story is too thin why you havent even
told me your name

  my name the arab smiled that
does not matter what does matter is
your distrust of me but since you have
admitted at last that you do know about

the crypt of nephren-ka perhaps i can
show you something that may prove my
own knowledge

  he thrust a lean hand under his robe
and drew forth a curious object of dull
black metal this he flung casually on
the table so that it lay in a fan of lamp-
light

  captain cartaret bent forward and
peered at the queer metallic thing his
thin usually pale face now glowed with
unconcealed excitement he grasped the
black object with twitching fingers

  the seal of nephren-ka he whis-
pered when he raised his eyes to the
inscrutable arabs once more they shone
with mingled incredulity and belief

  its true then-what you say the
captain breathed you could obtain this
only from the secret place the place of

the blind apes where-

  nephren-ka bindeth up the threads
of truth the smiling arab finished the
quotation for him

  you too have read the necronomi-
con then cartaret looked stunned
but there are only six complete versions
and i thought the nearest was in the
british museum

  the arabs smile broadened my fel-
low-countryman alhazred left many leg-
acies among his own people he said
softly there is wisdom available to all
who know where to seek it

  for a moment there was silence in the
room cartaret gazed at the black seal
and the arab scrutinized him in turn
the thoughts of both were far away at
last the thin elderly white man looked
up with a quick grimace of determina-
tion

  i believe your story he said lead
me

  the arab with a satisfied shrug took
a chair unbidden at the side of his host
from that moment he assumed complete
psychic mastery of the situation
fane of the black pharaoh



  first you must tell me what you
know he commanded then i shall
reveal the rest

  cartaret unconscious of the others
dominance complied he told the stran-
ger his story in an abstracted manner
while his eyes never swerved from the
cryptic black amulet on the table it was
almost as though he were hypnotized by
the queer talisman the arab said noth-
ing though there was a gay gloating in
his fanatical eyes



cartaret spoke of his youth of his
wartime service in egypt and sub-
sequent station in mesopotamia it was
here that the captain had first become in-
terested in archeology and the shadowy
realms of the occult which surround it
from the vast desert of arabia had come
intriguing tales as old as time furtive
fables of mystic irem city of ancient
dread and the lost legends of vanished
empires he had spoken to the dreaming
dervishes whose hashish visions revealed
secrets of forgotten days and had ex-
plored certain reputedly ghoul-ridden
tombs and burrows in the ruins of an
older damascus than recorded history
knows

  in time his retirement had brought
him to egypt here in cairo there was
access to still more secret lore egypt
land of lurid curses and lost kings has
ever harbored mad myths in its age-old
shadows cartaret had learned of priests
and pharaohs of olden oracles forgot-
ten sphinxes fabulous pyramids titanic
tombs civilization was but a cobweb
surface upon the sleeping face of eternal
mystery here beneath the inscrutable
shadows of the pyramids the old gods
still stalked in the old ways the ghosts
of set ra osiris and bubastis lurked
in desert ways horus isis and sebek yet

dwelt in the ruins of thebes and mem-
phis or bided in the crumbling tombs
below the valley of kings

  nowhere had the past survived as it
did in ageless egypt with every mum-
my the egyptologists uncovered a curse
the solving of each ancient secret merely
uncovered a deeper more perplexing rid-
dle who built the pylons of the tem-
ples why did the old kings rear the
pyramids how did they work such mar-
vels were their curses potent still
where vanished the priests of egypt

  these and a thousand other unan-
swered questions intrigued the mind of
captain cartaret in his new-found lei-
sure he read and studied talked with sci-
entists and savants ever the quest of
primal knowledge beckoned him on to
blacker brinks he could slake his thirsty
soul only in stranger secrets more dan-
gerous discoveries

  many of the reputable authorities he
knew were open in their confessed opin-
ion that it was not well for meddlers to
pry too deeply beneath the surface curses
had come true with puzzling promptness
and warning prophecies had been ful-
filled with a vengeance it was not good
to profane the shrines of the old dark
gods who still dwelt within the land

  but the terrible lure of the forgotten
and the forbidden was a pulsing virus in
cartarets blood when he heard the leg-
end of nephren-ka he naturally investi-
gated

  nephren-ka according to authorita-
tive knowledge was merely a mythical
figure he was purported to have been a
pharaoh of no known dynasty a priestly
usurper of the throne the most common
fables placed his reign in almost biblical
times he was said to have been the last
and greatest of that egyptian cult of
priest-sorcerers who for a time trans-
formed the recognized religion into a
dark and terrible thing this cult led


weird tales

by the arch-hierophants of bubastis anu-
bis and sebek viewed their gods as the
representatives of actual hidden beings
-montsrous beast-men who shambled on
earth in primal days they accorded wor-
ship to the elder one who is known to
myth as nyarlathotep the mighty mes-
senger this abominable deity was said
to confer wizards power upon receiving
human sacrifices and while the evil
priests reigned supreme they temporarily
transformed the religion of egypt into a
bloody shambles with anthropomancy
and necrophilism they sought terrible
boons from their demons

  the tale goes that nephren-ka on the
throne renounced all religion save that
of nyarlathotep he sought the power of
prophecy and built temples to the blind
ape of truth his utterly atrocious sacri-
fices at length provoked a revolt and it is
said that the infamous pharaoh was at
last dethroned according to this ac-
count the new ruler and his people im-
mediately destroyed all vestiges of the
former reign demolished all temples and
idols of nyarlathotep and drove out the
wicked priests who prostituted their faith
to the carnivorous bubastis anubis and
sebek the book of the dead was then
amended so that all references to the pha-
raoh nephren-ka and his accursed cults
were deleted

  thus argues the legend the furtive
faith was lost to reputable history as
to nephren-ka himself a strange ac-
count is given of his end

  the story ran that the dethroned pha-
raoh fled to a spot adjacent to what is
now the modern city of cairo here it
was his intention to embark with his re-
maining followers for a westward isle
historians believe that this isle wras
britain where some of the fleeing priests
of bubastis actually settled

  but the pharaoh was attacked and sur-
rounded his escape blocked it was then

that he had constructed a secret under-
ground tomb in which he caused himself
and his followers to be interred alive
with him in this vivisepulture he took
all his treasure and magical secrets so
that nothing would remain for his ene-
mies to profit by so cleverly did his re-
maining devotees contrive this secret
crypt that the attackers were never able
to discover the resting-place of the black
pharaoh

  thus the legend rests according to
common currency the fable was handed
dow-n by the few remaining priests who
actually stayed on the surface to seal the
secret place they and their descendants
were believed to have perpetuated the
story and the old faith of evil

following up this exceedingly un-
usual story cartaret delved into the
old tomes of the time during a trip to
london he was fortunate enough to be
allowed an inspection of the unhallowed
and archaic necronomicon of abdul al-
hazred in it were further emendations
one of his influential friends in the
home office hearing of his interest
managed to obtain for him a portion of
ludvig prinns evil and blasphemous de
vermis mysteriis known more familiarly
to students of recondite arcana as mys-
teries of the worm here in that greatly
disputed chapter on oriental myth entitled
saracenic rituals cartaret found still
more concrete elaborations of the neph-
ren-ka tale

  prinn who consorted with the me-
diaeval seers and prophets of saracen
times in egypt gave a good deal of
prominence to the whispered hints of
alexandrian necromancers and adepts
they knew the story of nephren-ka and
alluded to him as the black pharaoh

  prinns account of the pharaohs death
was much more elaborate he claimed
that the secret tomb lay directly beneath
fane of the black pharaoh



cairo itself and professed to believe that
it had been opened and reached he
hinted at the cult-survival mentioned in
the popular tales spoke of a renegade
group of descendants whose priestly an-
cestors had interred the rest alive they
were said to perpetuate the evil faith and
to act as guardians of the dead nephren-
ka and his buried brethren lest some
interloper discover and violate his resting-
place in the crypt after the regular
cycle of seven thousand years the black
pharaoh and his band would then arise
once more and restore the dark glory of
the ancient faith

  the crypt itself if prinn is to be be-
lieved was a most unusual place ne-
phren-kas servants and slaves had build-
ed him a mighty sepulcher and the bur-
rows were filled with the rich treasure of
his reign all of the sacred images were
there and the jeweled books of esoteric
wisdom reposed within

  most peculiarly did the account dwell
on nephren-kas search for the truth
and the power of prophecy it was said
that before he died down in the dark-
ness he conjured up the earthly image
of nyarlathotep in a final gigantic sacri-
fice and that the god granted him his
desires nephren-ka had stood before
the images of the blind ape of truth and
received the gift of divination over the
gory bodies of a hundred willing victims
then in nightmare manner prinn re-
counts that the entombed pharaoh wan-
dered among his dead companions and
inscribed on the twisted walls of his tomb
the secrets of the future in pictures and
ideographs he wrote the history of days
to come revelling in omniscient knowl-
edge till the end he scrawled the desti-
nies of kings to come painted the tri-
umphs and the dooms of unborn empires
then as the blackness of death shrouded
his sight and palsy wrenched the brush

from his fingers he betook himself in
peace to his sarcophagus and there died

   so said ludvig prinn he that consorted
with ancient seers nephren-ka lay in his
buried burrows guarded by the priestly
cult that still survived on earth and fur-
ther protected by enchantments in his
tomb below he had fulfilled his desires
at the end-he had known truth and
written the lore of the future on the
nighted walls of his own catacomb

  cartaret had read all this with con-
flicting emotions how he would like to
find that tomb if it existed what a sen-
sation-he would revolutionize anthro-
pology ethnology

  of course the legend had its absurd
points cartaret for all his research was
not superstitious he didnt believe the
bogus balderdash about nyarlathotep the
blind ape of truth or the priestly cult
that part about the gift of prophecy was
sheer drivel

  such things were commonplace there
were many savants who had attempted to
prove that the pyramids in their geo-
metrical construction were archeological
and architectural prophecies of days to
come with elaborate and convincing
skill they attempted to show that sym-
bolically interpreted the great tombs held
the key to history that they allegorically
foretold the middle ages the renais-
sance the great war

  this cartaret believed was rubbish
and the utterly absurd notion that a dy-
ing fanatic had been gifted with pro-
phetic power and scrawled the future his-
tory of the world on his tomb as a last
gesture before death-that was impos-
sible to swallow

   nevertheless despite his skeptical atti-
tude captain cartaret wanted to find the
tomb if it existed he had returned to
egypt with that intention and immedi-
ately set to work so far he had a number
of clues and hints if the machinery of


weird tales

his investigation did not collapse it was
now only a matter of days before he
would discover the actual entrance to the
spot itself then he intended to enlist
proper governmental aid and make his
discovery public to all

  this much he now told the silent arab
who had come out of the night with a
strange proposal and a weird credential
the seal of the black pharaoh ne-
phren-ka



when cartaret finished his sum-
mary he glanced at the dark stran-
ger in interrogation

  what next he asked

  follow me said the other urbanely
i shall lead you to the spot you seek
now gasped cartaret the other
nodded

  but-its too sudden i mean the
whole thing is like a dream you come
out of the night unbidden and unknown
show me the seal and graciously offer to
grant me my desires why it doesnt
make sense

  this makes sense the grave arab
indicated the black seal

  yes admitted cartaret but-how
can i trust you why must i go now
wouldnt it be wiser to wait and get the
proper authorities behind us wont
there be need of excavation arent there
necessary instruments to take

  no the other spread his palms up-
ward just come

  look here cartarets suspicion crys-
tallized in his sharp tones how do i
know this isnt a trap why should you
come to me this way who the devil are
you

  patience the dark man smiled i
shall explain all i have listened to your
accounts of the legend with great inter-
est and while your ds are clear your

own view of them is mistaken the leg-
end you have learned of is true-all of
it nephren-ka did write the future on
the walls of his tomb when he died he
did possess the power of divination and
the priests who buried him formed a cult
which did survive

  yes cartaret was impressed despite
himself

  i am one of those priests the
words stabbed like swords in the white
mans brain

  do not look so shocked it is the
truth i am a descendant of the original
cult of nephren-ka one of those inner
initiates who have kept the legend alive
i worship the power which the black
pharaoh received and i worship the god
nyarlathotep who accorded that power
to him to us believers the most sacred
truth lies in the hieroglyphs inscribed by
the divinely gifted pharaoh before he
died throughout the ages we guardian
priests have watched history unfold and
always it has agreed with the ideographs
on those tunneled walls we believe

  it is because of our belief that i have
sought you out for within the secret
crypt of the black pharaoh it is written
upon the walls of the future that you shall
descend there

  stunning silence

  do you mean to say carteret gasped
that those pictures show me discovering
the spot

  they do assented the dark man
slowly that is why i came to you un-
bidden you shall come with me and ful-
fill the prophecy tonight as it is writ-
ten

  suppose i dont come flashed cap-
tain cartaret suddenly what about
your prophecy then

  the arab smiled youll come he
said you know that

  cartaret realized that it was so noth-
fane of the black pharaoh



ing could keep him away from this amaz-
ing discovery a thought struck him

  if this wall really records the details
of the future he began perhaps you
can tell me a little about my own coming
history will this discovery make me fa-
mous will i return again to the spot
is it written that i am to bring the secret
of nephren-ka to light

  the dark man looked grave that i
do not know he admitted i neglected
to tell you something about the walls of
truth my ancestor-he who first de-
scended into the secret spot after it had
been sealed he who first looked upon the
work of prophecy-did a needful thing
deeming that such wisdom was not for
lesser mortals he piously covered the
walls with concealing tapestry thus
none might look upon the future too far
as time passed the tapestry was drawn
back to keep pace with the actual events
of history and always they have coincided
with the hieroglyphs through the ages
it has always been the duty of one priest
to descend to the secret tomb each day
and draw back the tapestry so as to reveal
the events of the day that follows now
during my life that is my mission my
fellows devote their time to the needful
rites of worship in hidden places i alone
descend the concealed passage daily and
draw back the curtain on the walls of
truth when i die another will take my
place understand me-the writing does
not minutely concern every single event
merely those which affect the history and
destiny of egypt itself today my friend
it was revealed that you should descend
and enter into the place of your desire
what the morrow holds in store for you
i cannot say until the curtain is drawn
once more

  cartaret sighed i suppose that there
is nothing else left but for me to go
then his eagerness was ill dissembled
the dark man observed this at once and

smiled cynically while he strode to the
door

  follow me he commanded

to captain cartaret that walk
through the moonlit streets of cairo
was blurred in chaotic dream his guide
led him into labyrinths of looming shad-
ows they wandered through the twisted
native quarters and passed through a
maze of unfamiliar alleys and thorough-
fares cartaret strode mechanically at the
dark strangers heels his thoughts avid
for the great triumph to come

  he hardly noticed their passage through
a dingy courtyard when his companion
drew up before an ancient well and
pressed a niche revealing the passage be-
neath he followed him as a matter of
course from somewhere the arab had
produced a flashlight its faint beam al-
most rebounded from the murk of the
inky tunnel

  together they descended a thousand
stairs into the ageless and eternal dark-
ness that broods beneath like a blind
man cartaret stumbled down-down
into the depths of three thousand van-
ished years



the temple was entered-the subter-
ranean temple-tomb of nephren-ka
through silver gates the priest passed
his dazed companion following behind

  cartaret stood in a vast chamber the
niched walls of which were lined with
sarcophagi

  they hold the mummies of the in-
terred priests and servants explained his
guide

  strange were the mummy-cases of
nephren-kas followers not like those
known to egyptology the carven covers
bore no recognized conventional features
as was the usual custom instead they


weird tales

presented the strange grinning counte-
nances of demons and creatures of fable
jeweled eyes stared mockingly from the
black visages of gargoyles spawned in a
sculptors nightmare from every side of
the room those eyes shone through the
shadows unwinking unchanging omnis-
cient in this little world of the dead

  cartaret stirred uneasily emerald eyes
of death ruby eyes of malevolence yel-
low orbs of mockery everywhere they
confronted him he was glad when his
guide led him forward at last so that the
incongruous rays of the flashlight shone
on the entrance beyond a moment later
his relief was dissipated by the sight of a
new horror confronting him at the inner
doorway

  two gigantic figures shambled there
guarding either side of the opening-two
monstrous troglodytic figures great go-
rillas they were enormous apes carved in
simian semblance from black stone they
faced the doorway squatting on mighty
haunches their huge hairy arms upraised
in menace their glittering faces were
brutally alive they grinned bare-fanged
with idiotic glee and they were blind-
eyeless and blind

  there was a terrible allegory in these
figures which carteret knew only too
well the blind apes were destiny per-
sonified a hulking mindless destiny
whose sightless stupid gropings trampled
on the dreams of men and altered their
lives by aimless flailings of purposeless
paws thus did they control reality

  these were the blind apes of truth
according to the ancient legend the sym-
bols of the old gods worshipped by
nephren-ka

  cartaret thought of the myths once
more and trembled if tales were true
nephren-ka had offered up that final
mighty sacrifice upon the obscene laps of
these evil idols offered them up to nyar-

lathotep and buried the dead in the
mummy-cases set here in the niches
then he had gone on to his own sepul-
cher within

  the guide proceeded stolidly past the
looming figures cartaret dissembling
his dismay started to follow for a mo-
ment his feet refused to cross that grue-
somely guarded threshold into the room
beyond he stared upward to the eyeless
ogreish faces that leered down from diz-
zying heights with the feeling that he
walked in realms of sheer nightmare but
the huge arms beckoned him on the un-
seeing faces were convulsed in a smile of
mocking invitation

  the legends were true the tomb ex-
isted would it not be better to turn back
now seek sane aid and return again to
this spot besides what unguessed terror
might not lair in the realms beyond
what horror spawn in the sable shadows
of nephren-kas inner secret sepulcher
all reason urged him to call out to the
strange priest and retreat to safety

  but the voice of reason was but a
hushed and awe-stricken whisper here in
the brooding burrows of the past this
was a realm of ancient shadow where an-
tique evil ruled here the incredible was
real and there was a potent fascination
in fear itself

  cartaret knew that he must go on cu-
riosity cupidity the lust for concealed
knowledge-all impelled him and the
blind apes grinned their challenge or
command

the priest entered the third chamber
and cartaret followed crossing the
threshold he plunged into an abyss of
unreality

  the room was lighted by braziers set
in a thousand stations their glow bathed
the enormous burrow with fiery lumi-
nance captain cartaret his head reeling
from the heat and mephitic miasma of

                     w t-
fane of the black pharaoh



the place was thus able to see the entire
extent of this incredible cavern

  seemingly endless a vast corridor
stretched on a downward slant into the
earth beyond-a vast corridor utterly
barren save for the winking red braziers
along the walls their flaming reflections
cast grotesque shadows that glimmered
with unnatural life cartaret felt as
though he were gazing on the entrance to
karneter-the mythical underworld of
egyptian lore

  here we are said his guide softly

  the unexpected sound of a human
voice was startling for some reason it
frightened cartaret more than he cared
to admit he had fallen into a vague ac-
ceptance of these scenes as being part of
a fantastic dream now the concrete
clarity of a spoken word only confirmed
an eery reality

  yes here they were in the spot of
legend the place known to alhazred
prinn and all the dark delvers into un-
hallowed history the tale of nephren-
ka was true and if so what about the
rest of this strange priests statements
what about the walls of truth on which
the black pharaoh had recorded the fu-
ture had foretold cartarets own advent
on the secret spot

  as if in answer to these inner whis-
pers the guide smiled

  come captain cartaret do you not
wish to examine the walls more closely

  the captain did not wish to examine
the walls desperately he did not for
they if in existence would confirm the
ghastly horror that gave them being if
they existed it meant that the whole evil
legend was real that nephren-ka black
pharaoh of egypt had indeed sacrificed
to the dread dark gods and that they had
answered his prayer captain cartaret did
not greatly wish to believe in such utterly
w t-

blasphemous abominations as nyarlatho-
tep

  he sparred for time

  where is the tomb of nephren-ka
himself he asked where are the
treasure and the ancient books

  the guide extended a lean forefinger

  at the end of this hall he ex-
claimed

  peering down the infinity of lighted
walls cartaret indeed fancied that his
eyes could detect a dark blur of objects
in the dim distance

  let us go there he said

  the guide shrugged he turned and
his feet moved over the velvet dust

  cartaret followed as if drugged

  the walls he thought i must not
look at the walls the walls of truth
the black pharaoh sold his soul to nyar-
lathotep and received the gift of prophe-
cy before he died here he wrote the fu-
ture of egypt on the walls i must not
look lest i believe i must not know

  red lights glittered on either side
step after step light after light glare
gloom glare gloom glare

  the lights beckoned enticed attracted
look at us they commanded see
dare to seeall

  cartaret followed his silent conductor

  look flashed the lights

  cartarets eyes grew glassy his head
throbbed the gleaming of the lights
was mesmeric they hypnotized with their
allure

  look

  would this great hall never end no
there were thousands of feet to go

  look challenged the leaping lights

  red serpent eyes in the underground
dark eyes of tempters brit gers of black
knowledge

  look wisdom know winked the
lights

  they flamed in cartarets brain why
not look-it was so easy why fear


weird tales

why his dazed mind repeated the ques-
tion eadi following flare of fire weak-
ened the question

  at last cartaret looked



mad minutes passed before he was
able to speak then he mumbled
in a voice audible only to himself

true he whispered all true

  he stared at the towering wall to his
left limned in red radiance it was an
interminable bayeux tapestry carved in
stone the drawing was crude in black
and white but it frightened this was no
ordinary egyptian picture-writing it was
not in the fantastic symbolical style of
ordinary hieroglyphics that was the ter-
rible part nephren-ka was a realist his
men looked like men his buildings were
buildings there was nothing here but a
representation of stark reality and it was
dreadful to see

  for at the point where cartaret first
summoned sufficient courage to gaze he
stared at an unmistakable tableau involv-
ing crusaders and saracens

  crusaders of the thirteenth century-
yet nephren-ka had then been dust for
nearly two thousand years

  the pictures were small yet vivid and
distinct they seemed to flow along quite
effortlessly on the wall one scene blend-
ing into another as though they had been
drawn in unbroken continuity it was as
though the artist had not stopped once
during his work as though he had untir-
ingly proceeded to cover this gigantic hall
in a single supernatural effort

  that was it-a single supernatural ef-
fort

  cartaret could not doubt rationalize
all he would it was impossible to believe
that these drawings were trumped up by
any group of artists it was one mans
work and the unerring horrid consist-

ency of it the calculated picturization of
the most vital and important phases of
egyptian history could have been set
down in such accurate order only by a
historical authority or a prophet ne-
phren-ka had been given the gift of
prophecy and so 

  as he ruminated in growing dread
cartaret and his guide proceeded now
that he had looked a medusian fascina-
tion held the mans eyes to the wall he
walked with history tonight history and
red nightmare flaming figures leered
from every side

  he saw the rise of the mameluke em-
pire looked on the despots and the ty-
rants of the east not all of what he saw
was familiar to cartaret for history has
its forgotten pages besides the scenes
changed and varied at almost every step
and it was quite confusing there was
one picture interspersed with an alexan-
drian court motif which depicted a cata-
comb evidently in some vaults beneath the
city here were gathered a number of
men in robes which bore a curious simi-
larity to those of cartarets present guide
they were conversing with a tall white-
bearded man whose crudely drawn figure
seemed to exude an uncanny aura of black
and baleful power

  ludvig prinn said the guide softly
noting cartarets stare he mingled
with our priests you know

  for some reason the depiction of this
almost legendary seer stirred cartaret
more deeply than any other hitherto re-
vealed terror the casual inclusion of the
infamous sorcerer in the procession of ac-
tual history hinted at dire things it was
as though cartaret had read a prosaic bi-
ography of satan in whos who

  nevertheless with a sort of heartsick
craving his eyes continued to search the
walls as they walked onward to the still
indeterminate end of the long red-illu-
mined chamber in whidi nephren-ka
fane of the black pharaoh



was interred the guide-priest now
for cartaret no longer doubted-pro-
ceeded softly but stole covert glances at
the white man as he led the way

  captain cartaret walked through a
dream only the walls were real now
the walls of truth he saw the othmans
rise and flourish looked on forgotten bat-
tles and unremembered kings often
there recurred in the sequence a scene de-
picting the priests of nephren-ka s own
furtive cult they were shown amidst the
disquieting surroundings of catacombs
and tombs engaged in unsavory occupa-
tions and revolting pleasures the cam-
era-film of time rolled on captain car-
taret and his companion walked on still
the walls told their story

  there was one small division of the
wall which portrayed the priests conduct-
ing a man in elizabethan costume
through what seemed to be a pyramid it
was eery to see the gallant in his finery
pictured amidst the ruins of ancient
egypt and it was very dreadful indeed to
almost watch like an unseen observer
when a stealthy priest knifed the english-
man in the back as he bent over a mum-
my-case

  what now impressed cartaret was the
infinitude of detail in each pictured frag-
ment the features of all the men were
almost photographically exact the draw-
ing while crude was life-like and real-
istic even the furniture and background
of every scene were correct there was
no doubting the authenticity of it all and
no doubting of the veracity thereby im-
plied but-what was worse-there was
no doubting that this work could not
have been done by any normal artist
however learned unless he had seen it
all

  nephren-ka had seen it all in pro-
phetic vision after his sacrifice to nyar-
lathotep

  cartaret was looking at truths inspired
by a demon   

  on and on to the flaming fane of wor-
ship and death at the end of the hall
history progressed as he walked now
he was looking at a period of egyptian
lore that was almost contemporary the
figure of napoleon appeared

  the battle of aboukir    the massacre
of the pyramids    the downfall of the
mameluke horsemen    the entrance to
cairo   

  once again a catacomb with priests
and three figures white men in french
military regalia of the period the priests
were leading them into a red room the
frenchmen were surprized overcome
slaughtered

  it was vaguely familiar cartaret was
recalling what he knew of napoleons
commission he had appointed savants
and scientists to investigate the tombs
and pyramids of the land the rosetta
stone had been discovered and other
things quite likely the three men shown
had blundered onto a mystery the priests
of nephren-ka had not wanted to have
unveiled hence they had been lured to
death as the walls showed it was quite
familiar-but there was another famili-
arity which cartaret could not place

they moved on and the years rushed
by in panorama the turks the
english gordon the plundering of the
pyramids the world war and ever so
often a picture of the priests of nephren-
ka and a strange white man in some cata-
comb or vault always the white man
died it was all familiar

  cartaret looked up and saw that he
and the priest were very near to the black-
ness at the end of the great fiery hall
only a hundred steps or so in fact the
priest face hidden in his burnoose was
beckoning him on

  cartaret looked at the wall the pic-


weird tales

tures were almost ended but no-just
ahead was a great curtain of crimson vel-
vet on a ceiling-rack which ran off into
the blackness and reappeared from shad-
ows on the opposite side of the room to
cover that wall

  the future explained his guide
and captain cartaret remembered that
the priest had told how each day he drew
back the curtain a bit so that the future
was always revealed just one day ahead
he remembered something else and has-
tily glanced at the last visible section of
the wall of truth next to the curtain
he gasped

  it was true almost as though gazing
into a miniature mirror he found himself
staring into his own face

  line for line feature for feature pos-
ture for posture he and the priest of ne-
phren-ka were shown standing together
in this red chamber just as they were
now

  the red chamber    familiarity the
elizabethan man with the priests of ne-
phren-ka were in a catacomb when the
man was murdered the french scientists
were in a red chamber when they died
other later egyptologists had been shown
in a red chamber with the priests and
they too had been slain the red cham-
ber not familiarity but similarity they
had been in this chamber and now he
stood here with a priest of nephren-ka
the others had died because they had
known too much too much about what
-nephren-ka

  a terrible suspicion began to formu-

late into hideous reality the priests of
nephren-ka protected their own this
tomb of their dead leaders was also their
fane their temple when intruders stum-
bled onto the secret they lured them
down here and killed them lest others
learn too much

  had not he come in the same way

  the priest stood silent as he gazed at
the wall of truth

  midnight he said softly i must
draw back the curtain to reveal yet an-
other day before we go on you ex-
pressed a wish captain cartaret to see
what the future holds in store for you
now that wish shall be granted

  with a sweeping gesture he flung the
curtain back along the wall for a foot
then he moved swiftly

  one hand leapt from the burnoose a
gleaming knife flashed through the air
drawing red fire from the lamps then
sank into cartarets back drawing redder
blood

  with a single groan the white man
fell in his eyes there was a look of su-
preme horror not born of death alone
for as he fell captain cartaret read his
future in the walls of truth and it con-
firmed a madness that could not be

  as captain cartaret died he looked at
the picture of his next hours of existence
and saiv himself being knifed by the
priest of nephren-ka

  the priest vanished from the silent
tomb just as the last flicker of dying eyes
showed to cartaret the picture of a still
white body-his body-lying in death
before the wall of truth

weird tales

contempt of my inferiors hatred for a
world that refused to see any merit in my
work these things have driven me to
commit a series of strange and terrible
crimes

  in these days i have thought often of
suicide as a way out-a cowards way
leaving me the fame i do not deserve
but since receiving your cablegram laud-
ing me for what i am not and never
could be i am determined to write this
letter for the world to read it will ex-
plain everything and having written it
i shall then atone for my sin in to you
perhaps a horribly ironic manner but
to me one that is most fitting

  let me go back to that miserable sleet-
lashed afternoon as i came into the hall
of mrs batess rooming-house-a crawl-
ing filthy hovel for the poverty-stricken
like myself who were too proud to go on
relief when i stumbled in drenched
and dizzy with hunger our landladys
ample figure was blocking the hallway
she was arguing with a tall shabbily
dressed young man whose face i was cer-
tain i had seen somewhere before

  just a week his deep pleasant voice
was beseeching the old harridan ill
pay you double at the end of that time
just as soon as i can put over a deal i
have in mind

  i paused staring at him covertly while
i shook the sleet from my hat-brim fine
gray eyes met mine across the landladys
head-haggard now and overbright with
suppressed excitement there was
strength character in that face under its
stubble of mahogany-brown beard there
was too a firm set to the mans shoulders
and beautifully formed head here i told
myself was someone who had lived all
his life with dangerous adventure some-
one whose clean-cut features even under
that growth of beard seemed vaguely
familiar to my sculptors-eye for detail

  not one day no sirree mrs bates

had folded her arms stubbornly a
weeks rent in advance or ye dont step
foot into one o my rooms

  on impulse i moved forward digging
into my pocket i smiled at the young
man and thrust almost my last two dol-
lars into the landladys hand smirking
she bobbed off and left me alone with
the stranger

  you shouldnt have done that he
sighed and gripped my hand hard
thanks old man ill repay you next
week though next week he whis-
pered and his eyes took on a glow of
anticipation ill write you a check for a
thousand dollars two thousand

  he laughed delightedly at my quizzical
expression and plunged out into the
storm again whistling

  in that moment his identity struck me
like a blow paul kennicott-the young
aviator whose picture had been on the
front page of every newspaper in the
country a few months ago his plane
had crashed somewhere in the brazilian
wilds and the nation mourned him and
his co-pilot for dead why was he sneak-
ing back into new york like a criminal-
penniless almost hysterical with excite-
ment with an air of secrecy about him-
to hide himself here in the slum district

i climb ed the rickety stairs to my shab-
by room and was plying the chisel
half-heartedly on my dancing group
when suddenly i became aware of a
peculiar buzzing sound like an angry bee
shut up in a jar i slapped my ears sev-
eral times annoyed believing the noise
to be in my own head but it kept on
growing louder by the moment

  it seemed to come from the hall and
simultaneously i heard the stair-steps
creak just outside my room

  striding to the door i jerked it open-
to see paul kennicott tiptoeing up the
stairs in stealthy haste he started vio-
the black stone statue



lently at sight of me and attempted to
hide under his coat an odd black box he
was carrying

  but it was too large almost two feet
square roughly fashioned of wood and
the canvas off an airplane wing but this
was not immediately apparent for the
whole thing seemed to be covered with a
coat of shiny black enamel when it
bumped against the balustrade however
it gave a solid metallic sound unlike
cloth-covered wood that humming noise
i was sharply aware came from inside
the box

  i stepped out into the hall and stood
blocking the passage rather grimly

  look here i snapped i know
who you are kennicott but i dont know
why youre hiding out like this whats
it all about youll tell me or ill turn
you over to the police

  panic leaped into his eyes they plead-
ed with me silently for an instant and
then we heard the plodding footsteps of
mrs bates come upstairs

  whos got that raddio her queru-
lous voice preceded her i hear it hum-
min get it right out of here if you
dont wanta pay me extry for the lectric-
ity its burninv

  oh ye gods kennicott groaned
frantically stall her dont let that
gabby old fool find out about this-itll
ruin everything help me and ill tell
you the whole story

  he darted past me without waiting for
my answer and slammed the door after
him the droning noise subsided and
then was swiftly muffled so that it was
no longer audible

  mrs bates puffed up the stairs and
eyed me accusingly so its you thats
got that raddio i told you the day you

come-

  all right i said pretending annoy-
ance ive turned it off and anyhow it

goes out tomorrow i was just keeping it
for a friend

  eh well- she eyed me sourly

then sniffed and went on back down-
stairs muttering under her breath

  i strode to kennicotts door and rapped
softly a key grated in the lock and i was
admitted by my wild-eyed neighbor on
the bed muffled by pillows lay the black
box humming softly on a shrill note

  i n-n n-ng-ng it went exactly
like a radio tuned to a station that is
temporarily off the air

  curiosity was gnawing at my vitals
impatiently i watched kennicott striding
up and down the little attic room strik-
ing one fist against the other palm

  well i demanded

  and with obvious reluctance in a voice
jerky with excitement he began to unfold
the secret of the thing inside that onyx-
like box i sat on the bed beside it my
eyes riveted on kennicotts face spell-
bound by what he was saying

ur plane he began was demol-
ished we made a forced landing
in the center of a dense jungle if you
know brazil at all youll know what it
was like trees trees trees crawling
insects as big as your fist a hot sicken-
ing smell of rotting vegetation and now
and then the screech of some animal or
bird eery enough to make your hair stand
on end we cracked up right in the mid-
dle of nowhere

  i crawled out of the wreckage with
only a sprained wrist and a few minor
cuts but mccrea-my co-pilot you
know-got a broken leg and a couple of
bashed ribs he was in a bad way poor
devil fat little guy bald scared of
women and always cracking wise about
something a swell sport

  the aviators face convulsed briefly
and he stared at the box on the bed be-


weird tales

side me with a peculiar expression of
loathing

  mccrea y dead then i prompted

  kennicott nodded his head dully and
shrugged god only knows i guess
youd call it death but let me get on
with it

  we slashed and sweated our way
through an almost impenetrable wall of
undergrowth for two days carrying what
food and cigarets we had in that make-
shift box there

  a thumb-jerk indicated the square
black thing beside me droning softly
without a break on the same high note

  mccrea was running a fever though
so we made camp and i struck out to find
water when i came back-

  kennicott choked i stared at him
waiting until his hoarse voice went on
doggedly

  when i came back mccrea was gone
i called and called no answer then
thinking he might have wandered away
delirious i picked out his trail and fol-
lowed it into the jungle it wasnt hard
to do because he had to break a path
through that wall of undergrowth and
now and then id find blood on a bram-
ble or maybe a scrap of torn cloth from
his khaki shirt

  not more than a hundred yards south
of our camp i suddenly became aware of
a queer humming sound in my ears posi-
tive that this had drawn mccrea i fol-
lowed it it got louder and louder like
the drone of a powerful dynamo it
seemed to fill the air and set all the trees
to quivering my teeth were on edge
with the monotony of it but i kept on
and unexpectedly found myself walking
into a patch of jungle that was all black
not burnt in a forest fire as i first
thought but dead-black in every detail
not a spot of color anywhere and in that
jungle with all its vivid foliage the effect
really slapped you in the face it was as

though somebody had turned out the
lights and yet you could still distinguish
the formation of every object around you
it was uncanny

  there was black sand on the ground
as far as i could see not soft jungle-
soil damp and fertile this stuff was as
hard and dry as emery and it glittered
like soft coal all the trees were black
and shiny like anthracite and not a leaf
stirred anywhere not an insect crawled i
almost fainted as i realized why

   it was a petrified forest

  those trees leaves and all had turned
into a shiny black kind of stone that
looked like coal but was mudi harder it
wouldnt chip when i struck it with a
fallen limb of the same stuff it wouldnt
bend i simply had to squeeze through
holes in underbrush more rigid than cast
iron and all black mind you-a jungle
of fuliginous rock like something out of
dantes inferno

  once i stumbled over an object and
stopped to pick it up it was mccreas
canteen-the only thing in sight besides
myself that was not made of that queer
black stone he had come this way then
relieved i started shouting his name
again but the sound of my voice fright-
ened me the silence of that place fairly
pressed against my eardrums broken only
by that steady droning sound but you
see id become so used to it like the
constant ticking of a clock that i hardly
heard it

  panic swept over me all at once an
unreasonable fear as the sound of my
own voice banged against the trees and
came back in a thousand echoes borne on
that humming sound that never changed
its tone i dont know why maybe it was
the grinding monotony of it and the un-
relieved black of that stone forest but
my nerve snapped and i bolted back
along the way i had come sobbing like
a kid
the black stone statue



  i must have run in a circle though
tripping and cutting myself on that rock-
underbrush in my terror i forgot the
direction of our camp i was lost-
abruptly i realized it-lost in that hell of
coal-black stone without food or any
chance of getting it with mccreas
empty canteen in my hand and no idea
where he had wandered in his fever

  for hours i plunged on forgetting to
back-track and cursing aloud because mc-
crea wouldnt answer me that hum-
ming noise had got on my nerves now
droning on that one shrill note until i
thought i would go mad exhausted i
sank down on that emery-sand croudied
against the trunk of a black stone tree
mccrea had deserted me i thought
crazily someone had rescued him and
he had left me here to die-which
should give you an idea of my state of
mind

  i huddled there letting my eyes rove
in a sort of helpless stupor on the sand
beside me was a tiny rock that resembled
a butterfly delicately carved out of onyx
i picked it up dazedly staring at its hard
little legs and feelers like wire that
would neither bend nor break off and
then my gaze started wandering again

  it fastened on something a few dozen
paces to my right-and i was sure then
that i had gone mad at first it seemed
to be a stump of that same dark mineral
but it wasnt a stump i crawled over to
it and sat there gaping at it with my
senses reeling while that humming noise
rang louder and louder in my ears

  it was a black stone statue of mc-
crea perfect in every detail

  he was depicted stooping over with
one hand holding out his automatic
gripped by the barrel his stocky figure
aviators helmet his makeshift crutch
and even the splints on his broken leg
were shiny black stone and his face to

the last hair of his eyelashes was a per-
fect mask of black rock set in an expres-
sion of puzzled curiosity

t got to my feet and walked around
-b the figure then gave it a push it
toppled over just like a statue and the
sound of its fall was deafening in that
silent forest hefting it i was amazed
to find that it weighed less than twenty
pounds i hacked at it with a file we had
brought from the plane in lieu of a
machete but only succeeded in snapping
the tool in half not a chip flew off the
statue not a dent appeared in its pol-
ished surface

  the thing was so unspeakably weird
that i did not even try to explain it to
myself but started calling mccrea again
if it was a gag of some kind he could
explain it but there was no answer to
my shouts other than the monotonous
hum of that unseen dynamo

  instead of frightening me more this
weird discovery seemed to jerk me up
short collecting my scattered wits i
started back-trailing myself to the camp
thinking mccrea might have returned in
my absence the droning noise was so
loud now it pained my eardrums unless
i kept my hands over my ears this i
did stumbling along with my eyes glued
to my own footprints in the hard dry
sand

  and suddenly i brought up short
directly ahead of me under a black stone
bush lay something that made me gape
with my mouth ajar

  i cant describe it-no one could it
resembled nothing so much as a star-
shaped blob of transparent jelly that
shimmered and changed color like an
opal it appeared to be some lower form
of animal one-celled not large only
about a foot in circumference when it
stretched those feelers out to full length
it oozed along over the sand like a snail


weird tales

groping its way with those star-points-
and it hummed

  the droning noise ringing in my ears
issued from this nightmare creature

  it was nauseating to watch and yet
beautiful too with all those iridescent
colors gleaming against that setting of
dead-black stone i approached within a
pace of it started to nudge it with my
foot but couldnt quite bring myself to
touch the squashy thing and ive
thanked my stars ever since for being so
squeamish

  instead i took off my flying-helmet
and tossed the goggles directly in the
path of the creature it did not pause or
turn aside but merely reached out one
of those sickening feelers and brushed
the goggles very lightly

  and they turned to stone

  just that god be my witness that
those leather and glass goggles grew
black before my starting eyes in less
than a minute they were petrified into
hard fuliginous rock like everything else
around me

  in one hideous moment i realized the
meaning of that weirdly life-like statue
of mccrea i knew what he had done
he had prodded this jelly-like thing
with his automatic and it had turned
him-and everything in contact with him
-into shiny dark stone

  nausea overcame me i wanted to
run to escape the sight of that oozing
horror but reason came to my rescue i
reminded myself that i was paul kenni-
cott intrepid explorer through a hor-
rible experience mccrea and i had stum-
bled upon something in the brazilian
wilds which would revolutionize the civ-
ilized world mccrea was dead or in
some ghastly suspended form of life
through his efforts to solve the mystery
i owed it to him and to myself not to
lose my head now

  for the practical possibilities of the

thing struck me like a blow that black
stone the creatures touch created from
any earth-substance-by rays from its
body by a secretion of its glands by god
knows what strange metamorphosis-was
indestructible bridges houses build-
ings roads could be built of ordinary
material and then petrified by the touch
of this jelly-like thing which had surely
tumbled from some planet with life-
forces diametrically opposed to our own

  millions of dollars squandered on
construction each year could be diverted
to other phases of life for no cyclone or
flood could damage a city built of this
hard black rock

  i said a little prayer for my martyred
co-pilot and then and there resolved to
take the creature back to civilization
with me

  it could be trapped i was sure-
though the prospect appealed to me far
less than that of caging a hungry leopard
i did not venture to try it until i had
studied the problem from every angle
however and made certain deductions
through experiment

  i found that any substance already
petrified was insulated against the things
power i tossed my belt on it saw it
freeze into black rock then put my
wrist-watch in contact with the rock belt
my watch remained as it was another
phenomenon i discovered was that petri-
faction also occurred in things in direct
contact with something the creature
touched if that something was not al-
ready petrified

  dropping my glove fastened to my
signet ring i let the creature touch only
the glove but both objects were petri-
fied i tried it again with a chain of
three objects and discovered that the
touched object and the one in contact
with it turned into black rock while the
third on the chain remained unaffected
the black stone statue



tt took me about three days to trap
- the thing although it gave no more
actual resistance of course than a large
snail mccrea poor devil had blun-
dered into the business but i went at it
in a scientific manner knowing what
danger i faced from the creature i
found my way again to our camp and
brought back our provision box-yes the
one there on the bed beside you when
the things touch had turned it into a
perfect stone cage for itself i scooped it
inside with petrified brandies but
lord how the sweat stood out on my
face at the prospect of a slip that might
make me touch the horrible little organ-
ism

  the trip out of that jungle was a
nightmare i spent almost all i had hir-
ing scared natives to guide me a mile or
so before theyd bolt with terror of my
humming box on board a tramp steam-
er bound for the states i nearly lost my
captive the first mate thought it was an
infernal machine and tried to throw it
overboard my last cent went to shut
him up so i landed in new york flat
broke

  paul kennicott laughed and spread
his hands but here i am i dont dare
go to anyone i know just yet reporters
will run me ragged and i want plenty of
time to make the right contacts do you
realize whats in that box he grinned
with boyish delight fame and for-
tune thats what mccreas family will
never know want again science will re-
member our names along with edison
and bell and all the rest weve dis-
covered a new force that will rock the
world with its possibilities thats why
he explained ive sneaked into the
country like an alien if the wrong peo-
ple heard of this first my life wouldnt
be worth a dime understand there are
millions involved in this thing billions
dont you see

  he stopped eyeing me anxiously i
stared at him and rose slowly from the
bed thoughts were seething in my
mind-dark ugly thoughts ebbing and
flowing to the sound of that i-n n-
n n g-n n g that filled the shabby
room

  for i did see the possibilities of that
jelly-like things power to turn any ob-
ject into black stone but i was thinking
as a sculptor what do i care for roads
or buildings sculpture is my whole life
to my minds eye rose the picture of co-
pilot mccrea as kennicott had described
him-a figure perfect to the last detail
done in black stone

  kennicott was still eyeing me anxious-
ly-perhaps reading the ugly thoughts
that flitted like shadows behind my eyes

  youll keep mum he begged do
that for me old boy and ill set you up
in a studio beyond your wildest dreams
ill build up your fame as-what are
you

  his gray eyes fastened on my dirty
smock

  some kind of an artist ill show you
how much i appreciate your help are
you with me

  some kind of an artist perhaps if he
had not said that flaying my crushed
pride and ambition to the quick i would
never have done the awful thing i did
but black jealousy rose in my soul-
jealousy of this eager young man who
could walk out into the streets now with
his achievement and make the world bow
at his feet while i in my own field was
no more to the public than what he had
called me some kind of an artist at
that moment i knew precisely what i
wanted to do

  i did not meet his frank gray eyes in-
stead i pinned my gaze on that droning
black box as my voice rasped harshly

  no do you really imagine that i
believe this idiotic story of yours youre


weird tales

  insane im going to call the police-
theyll find out what really happened to
mccrea out there in the jungle theres
nothing in that box its just a trick

  kennicotts mouth fell open then
closed in an angry line the next mo
ment he shrugged and laughed

  of course you dont believe me he
nodded who could-unless they had
seen what ive seen with my own eyes
here he said briskly ill take this
book and drop it in the box for you
youll see the creature and youll see this
book turned into black stone

  i stepped back heart pounding eyes
narrowed kennicott leaned over the
bed unfastened the box gingerly with a
wary expression on his face and mo-
tioned me to approach briefly i glanced
over his shoulder as he dropped the book
inside the open box

  i saw horror-a jelly-like opalescent
thing like a five-pointed star it pulsed
and quivered for an instant and the room
fairly rocked to the unmuffled sound of
that vibrant humming

  i also saw the small cloth-bound book
kennicott had dropped inside it lay
half on top of the squirming creature-a
book carved out of black stone

  there you see kennicott pointed
and those were the last words he ever
uttered

  remembering what he had said about
the power of the creature being unable
to penetrate to a third object i snatched
at kennicotts sleeve-covered arm gave
him a violent shove and saw his muscu-
lar hand plunge for an instant deep into
the black box the sleeve hardened be-
neath my fingers

  i cowered back sickened at what i had
done

  paul kennicott his arms thrown out
and horror stamped on his fine young
face had frozen into a statue of black
shiny stone

  then footsteps were clumping up the
stairs again i realized that mrs bates
would surely have heard the violent
droning that issued from the open box i
shut it swiftly muffled it and shoved it
under the bed

i was at my own doorway when the
landlady came puffing up the stairs
my face was calm my voice contained
and no one but me could hear the furi-
ous pounding of my heart

  now you look a-here mrs bates
burst out i told you to turn that raddio
off you take it right out of my room
this minute runnin up my bill for
lectricity

  i	apologized meekly and with a great
show carried out a tool-case of mine
saying it was the portable radio i had
been testing for a friend it satisfied her
for the moment but later as i was carry-
ing the black stone figure of paul kenni-
cott to my own room she caught me at it

  why the old snoop exclaimed if
that aint the spittin image of our new
roomer friend of yours is he

  i	thought swiftly and lied jauntily a
model of mine ive been working on
this statue at night the reason you
havent seen him going in and out i
thought i would have to rent a room for
him here but as the statue is finished
now it wont be necessary after all you
may keep the rent money though i
added and get me a taxi to haul my
masterpiece to the express station i am
ready to submit it to the museum of fine
arts

  and that is my story gentlemen the
black stone statue which ironically i
chose to call fear of the unknown is not
a product of my skill small wonder
several people have noticed its re-
semblance to the lost explorer paul
kennicott nor did i do the group of
the black stone statue



soldiers commissioned by the anti-war
association none of my so-called
symphonies in black were wrought by
my hand-but i can tell you what became
of the models who were unfortunate
enough to pose for me

  my real work is perhaps no better
than that of a rank novice although up
to that fatal afternoon i had honestly be-
lieved myself capable of great work as a
sculptor some day

  but i am an impostor you want a
statue of me you say in your cablegram
done in the mysterious black stone which
has made me so famous ah gentle-
men you shall have that statue

  i am writing this confession aboard the
 s madrigal and i shall leave it with a
steward to be mailed to you at our next
port of call

  tonight i shall take out of my state-
room the hideous thing in its black box
which has never left my side such a
creature contrary to all nature on this

earth of ours should be exterminated
as soon as darkness falls i shall stand on
deck and balance the box on the rail so
that it will fall into the sea after my hand
has touched what is inside

  i wonder if the process of being turned
into that black rock is painful or if it is
accompanied only by a feeling of leth-
argy and mccrea paul kennicott and
those unfortunate models whom i have
passed off as my work-are they dead
as we know death or are their statues
sentient and possessed of nerves how
does that jelly creature feel to the touch
does it impart a violent electrical shock
or a subtle emanation of some force be-
yond our ken changing the atom-struc-
ture of the flesh it turns into stone

  many such questions have occurred to
me often in the small hours when i lie
awake tortured by remorse for what i
have done

  but tonight gentlemen i shall know
all the answers

id house on the hill

by winona montgomery gilliland

from the wide valley i looked up and saw
the house upon the hill that i had seen
so many times before by every law
it should have seemed just what it long had been

an old house that someone with loving care

had painted white at doors and windows hung
green-painted shutters but it had an air
of difference today the wind had flung

or some hand closed the shutters on the doors

french-doors with windows over them the trim
between shone white through pines and sycamores

to form two crosses and my eyes grew dim

i thought there is no home without its cross
hidden about it somewhere pain-or loss
    lames of vengeance

by seabury quinn

a strange doom hung over young pemberton and his wife a brooding horror
spawned in india and transplanted to america in all its murderous
potency-a brilliant exploit of jules de grandin

with intently narrowed eyes
lips pursed in concentration
jules de grandin stood envel-
oped in a gayly flowered apron while he
measured out the olive oil as an apothe-
cary might decant a precious drug in
the casserole before him lay the lobster
meat the shredded bass the oysters the
crab-meat and the eel across the stove
from him nora mcginnis my household
factotum and the finest cook in northern
jersey gazed at him like a nun breathless
with adoration

  mon dieu he whispered reverently
one little drop too much and he is
ruined a single drop too few and he is
simply spoiled observe me ma petite

see how i drop iessence de iolive-

  the door-bells clangor broke the si-
lence like a raucous laugh occurring at a
funeral service nora jumped a full six
inches the olive oil ran trickling from the
cruet splashing on the prepared sea-food
in the sauce-pan small frenchman and
big irishwoman exchanged a look of
consternation a look such as the lord
chancellor might give the lord chief
justice if at the moment of anointment
the archbishop were to pour the ampul-
las entire contents on the unsuspecting
head of britains new-crowned king
the bouillabaisse was ruined

  bring him here bade jules de gran-
din in a choking voice bring the vile
miscreant here and i shall ait his black
heart out i shall pull his so vile nose

i shall-

       

  indade an yell not protested nora
 tis meself asll take me hand offn th

side of is face-

  id better leave you with your sor-
row i broke in as i tiptoed toward the
door its probably a patient and i
cant afford to have you commit mayhem
on my customers

  doctor de grandin asked the
young man at the door ive a letter to

you from-

  come into the study i invited
doctor de grandins occupied right
now but hell see you in a minute
the visitor was tall and lean not thin
but trained down to bone and muscle
and his face possessed that brownish
tinge which tells of residence in the trop-
ics his big nose high cheekbones and
sandy hair together with his smartly
clipped mustache would have labeled
him a briton even had he lacked the
careless nonchalance of dress and oxford
accent which completed his ensemble

  jolly good of sergeant costello to
give me a chit to you he told de gran-
din as the little frenchman came into
the study and eyed him with cold hatred
im sure i dont know where i could
have looked for help if hed not thought
of you

  de grandins frigid manner showed
no sign of thawing what can i do
for you monsieur le capitaiie-or is it
lieutenant he asked

  the caller gave a start you know
me he demanded
flames of vengeance



  i have never had the pleasure of be-
holding you before the frenchman an-
swered his tone implied he was not
anxious to prolong the scrutiny

  but you knew i was in the service
naturally you are obviously eng-
lish and a gentleman you were at least
eighteen in  that assures one you
were in the war your complexion shows
you have resided in the tropics which
might mean either india or africa but
you called the sergeants note a chit
which means youve spent some time in
india now if you will kindly state your

business- he paused with raised

eyebrows

  its a funny mixed-up sort o thing
the other answered youre right in
saying that ive been in india i was out
there almost twenty years chucked it
up and went to farmin then a cousin
died here in the province of new jersey
leavin me a mass o rock and rubble and
about two hundred thousand pounds to
boot

  the look of long-enduring patience
deepened on de grandins features
and what is one to do he rejoined
wearily help you find a buyer for the
land you will be going back to eng-
land with the cash of course

  the callers tanned complexion deep-

weird tales

ened with a flush but he ignored the
studied insult of the question no such
luck id not be takin up your time if
things were simple as that what i need
is someone to help me duck the family
curse until i can comply with the wills
terms he was a queer blighter this
american cousin of mine his great-
grandfather came out to the provinces-
the states i should say-without so
much as a pot to drink his beer from or
a window he could toss it out of cadet
of the family and all that you know
he must have prospered though for
when he burned to death he left half the
bally county to his heirs at law and pro-
vided in his will that whoever took the
estate must live at least twelve months
in the old mansion house sort o period
of probation you see no member of
the family can get a penny of the cash
till hes finished out his year of resi-
dence i fancy the old duffer got the
wind up at the last and was bound hed
show the heathens that their blighted
curse was all a lot of silly rot

de grandins air of cold hostility
had been moderating steadily as
the caller finished speaking he leant for-
ward with a smile you have spoken of
a family curse monsieur just what is it
if you please

  an embarrassed look came in the
others face dont think that im an
utter ass he begged i know it sounds
a bit thick when you put it into words
but-well the thing has seemed to work
and id rather not take chances all right
for me of course but theres avis and
the little chap to think of

  old albert pemberton my great-
grandfathers brother and the founder of
the family in america left two sons
john and albert junior they were will-
ing enough to pass their year of resi-
dence but neither of em finished it john

left two sons and they died trying to
live out the year at foxcroft so did their
two sisters and their husbands the
chap i take it from was the younger
daughters son and not born on the
property theres never been a birth in
the old manor house though there have
been twelve sudden deaths there for
every legatee attempting to observe the
dictates of old alberts will has died yet
each generation has passed the estate
down with the same proviso for a years
residence as condition precedent to in-
heritance seems as if theyre all deter-
mined to defy the curse-

  mille tourments this everlasting
curse what is this seven times accursed
curse of which you speak so glibly and
tell us absolutely nothing

  for answer pemberton readied in his
jacket and produced a locket it was
made of gold slightly larger than an
old-time watch and set with rows of
seed-pearls round the edge snapping it
open he disclosed two portraits painted
with minute detail on ivory plaques one
was of a young man in a tightly-buttoned
jacket of white cloth high-collared gilt-
braided with insignia of some military
rank upon the shoulders upon his head
he wore a military cap shaped something
like the kepi which the french wore in
algeria about the middle of the nine-
teenth century hooded in a linen sheath
which terminated in a neck-doth trailing
down between his shoulders despite the
mustache and long sideburns the face
was youthful the man could not have
been much more than three and twenty

  thats albert pemberton our visitor
announced and thats his wife maria
or as she was originally known saras-

  quite so lovely wasnt she

  she was indeed her hair so black
it seemed to have the blue lights of a

cockerels ruff within its depths was
smoothly parted in the middle and
brought down each side her face across
the small and low-set ears framing an
oleander-white forehead her wide-
spaced large dark eyes and her full-
lipped mouth were exquisite her nose
was small and straight with fine-cut
nostrils her chin inclined to pointed-
ness was cleft across the middle by a
dimple brows of almost startling black
curved in circumflexes over her fine eyes
in the flying gull formation so much
prized by beauty connoisseurs of the
early eighteen hundreds pearl-set pend-
ants dangled from her ear-lobes nearly
to the creamy shoulders which her low-
necked gown exposed one hand was
laid upon her bosom and the fingers
were so fine and tapering that they
seemed almost transparent and were
tipped by narrow pointed nails almost as
red as strawberries she was younger
than her husband by some three or four
years and her youthful look was height-
ened by the half-afraid half-pleading
glance that lay in her dark eyes

  que eest belle que eest jeune de
grandin breathed and it was through
her-

  our caller started forward in his chair
yes howd you guess it

  i looked at them in wonder that
they understood each other perfectly was
obvious but what it was they were agreed
on i could not imagine

  de grandin chuckled as he noticed
my bewilderment tell him mon ami
he bade the englishman he cannot
understand how one so lovely-morbleu
my friend he turned to me i bet my-
self five francs you do not more than
half suspect the ladys nationality

  of course i do i answered short-
ly shes english anyone can see
that much she was mrs pemberton

and-

   w t-

  non non he answered with a
laugh that is the beauty of the tropics
which we see upon her face she was-
correct me if i err monsieur-he
bowed to pemberton-she was an
indian lady and unless i miss my guess
a high-caste hindoo one of those in
whom the blood of alexanders conquer-
ing greeks ran almost undefiled nest-
ce-pas

  correct our visitor agreed my
great-great-uncle met her just before the
mutiny in  it was through her that
he came here and through her that the
curse began according to the family
legend

  lights were playing in de grandins
eyes little flashes like heat-lightning
flickering in a summer sky as he bent
and tapped our caller on the knee with an
imperative forefinger at the begin-
ning if you please monsieur he bade
start at the beginning and relate the
tale it may help to guide us when we
come to formulate our strategy this
monsieur albert pemberton met his lady
while he served with the east india com-
pany in the days before the sepoy
mutiny how was it that he met her
and where did it occur

pemberton smiled quizzically as he
lighted the cigar the frenchman prof-
fered i have it from his journal he
replied they were great diarists those
old boys and my uncle rated a double

happenings of the day with photographic
detail in the fall of  he was scout-

weird tales

fires had just been lighted underneath the
troopers cook-pots when there came a
sort of ominous murmur from the road-
way which wound past the woodland
toward the river and the burning-ghats
beyond little flickers of the flame that
was about to burst into a holocaust next
year were already beginning to show and
my uncle thought it best to take no
chances so he sent a file of troopers with
a subadar to see what it was all about in
ten or fifteen minutes they came back
swearing such oaths as only afghan
mussulmans can use when speaking of
despised hindoos

   fr wah it is a burning captain sahib
the subadar reported the infidels-may
allah make their faces black - drag
forth a widow to be burnt upon her hus-
bands funeral pyre

  now the british raj forbade suttee
in  and made those taking any part
in it accessories to murder technically
therefore my uncles duty was to stop
the show but he had but twenty sowars
in his detail and the hindoos probably
would number hundreds he was as you
americans say in a decided spot if he
interfered with the religious rite even
though the law forbade it hed have a
first-class riot on his hands and probably
lose half of his command if the whole
detail werent massacred besides his
orders were to scout and bring reports in
to the residency and hed not be able
to perform his mission if he lost too
many men or was killed in putting down
a riot on the other hand here was a
crime in process of commission under his
immediate observation and his duty was

to stop it so-

  morbleu one understands de gran-
din chuckled he was as one might
say between the devil and the ocean
what did he do this amiable ancestor
of yours monsieur one moment if you
please- he raised his hand to shut

off pembertons reply i make the
wager with myself i bet me twenty
francs i know the answer to his conduct
ere you tell it bon the wager is re-
corded now if you please proceed

  a boyish grin was on the britons face
as he replied it was a tight fix to be in
but i think the old boy used his head
at that first of all he bundled his dis-
patches in a packet and told a sowar off
to take them to the residency it was no
childs-play to select a messenger for
every man in his command itched to sink
a saber-blade in hindoo flesh so finally
they compromised by drawing lots
theyre a bunch of fatalistic johnnies
those mohammedans and the chap who
drew the short straw said it was the will
of allah that he be denied the pleasure
of engaging in the shindy and rode away
without another murmur then my uncle
told the men to stand to arms while he
left them with the subadar and took two
others to go scouting with him

  at the forest edge they saw the
hindoos coming and it must have been
a sight according to his diary they
were raising merry hell with drums and
cymbals and tom-toms singing and wail-
ing and shrieking as if their luncheon
disagreed with them in the van came
brahmin priests all decked out in robes
of state and marching like a squad of
sergeants major on parade then came a
crowd of gurus-theyre holy men you
know and my uncle knew at once that
these were specially holy for whereas
the average fakir shows enough bare hide
to let you guess at his complexion these
fellows were so smeared with filth and
ashes that you couldnt tell if they were
black or white and you could smell em
half a mile away if you happened to get
down-wind of em they were jumpin
and contortin round a four-wheeled cart
to which a span of bullocks had been
harnessed and in which stood a ten-foot
flames of vengeance



image of the goddess kali whos sup-
posed to manifest the principles of love
and death if youve ever seen those
idols you know what this one looked like
-black as sin and smeared with goats
blood four arms branchin from its
shoulders tongue hangin out and all a-
wash with betel-juice and henna theres
a collar o skulls strung round its neck
and a belt of human hands tied round its
waist not an appetizin sight at any
time when its plastered thick with half-
dried blood and rancid butter its enough
to make a feller gag

  followin the kali-cart was another
crowd o brahmins all dressed up for a
part and in their midst they dragged-
for she could scarcely walk-a girl as
white as you or i

  a white woman you say i inter-
rupted

  you ought to know youve just
looked at her picture answered pem-
berton raising the locket from his knee
and holding out the sweet pale face
for my inspection that was my aunt
maria-or sarastai as she was then

  i suppose she must have looked a
little different in her native dress but ill
wager she was no less beautiful my
uncles diary records that she was fairly
loaded down with jewels everywhere a
gem could find a resting-place had been
devoted to her decoration there was
a diadem of pearls and rubies on her
head a golden flower or fan-like orna-
ment of filigree in which small emeralds
and seed-pearls were set had been hung
in her nose and dropped so low across
her lips that he could hardly see her
mouth her ears and neck and shoulders
and arms and wrists and ankles and every
toe and finger bore some sort of jewel
and her gold-embroidered sari was sewn
about the border with more gems and
even her white-muslin veil was edged
with seed-pearls

  two brahmins held her elbows half
leading and half dragging her along and
her head swayed drunkenly now forward
on her breast now falling to one shoul-
der or the other as she lurched and stag-
gered on the road

  last of all there marched a company
of men with simitars and pistols and a
few long-barreled muskets in their midst
they bore a bier on which a corpse lay in
full-dress regalia pearl-embroidered tur-
ban robe of woven silk and gold waist-
shawl set with diamonds from the rich-
ness of the widows jewels and the mag-
nificent accouterments the corpse dis-
played as well as by the size of the es-
cort my uncle knew the dead man was of
great importance in the neighborhood
certainly a wealthy landlord probably an
influential nobleman or even petty
prince

 oor child i murmured no won-
a der she was frightened to the point
of fainting to be burned alive-

   it wasnt terror sir said pemberton
you see to be sati that is to offer one-
self as a voluntary sacrifice upon the fun-
eral pyre was considered not only the
most pious act a widow could perform
it enhanced her husbands standing in the
future world indian women of that day
-and even nowadays-had that drilled
into them from infancy but sometimes
the flesh is weaker than the spirit in
sarastais case her husband was an old
man so old that she had never been his
wife in anything but name and when
he died she flinched at the decree that
she must burn herself upon his funeral
pyre to have a widow backslide es-
pecially the widow of such an influential
man as he had been would have cast dis-
honor on the family and brought undy-
ing scandal to the neighborhood so they
filled her up with opium and gunjah put
her best clothes on her and marched her


weird tales

to the burning-ghat half conscious and all
but paralyzed with drugs-

  ah yes one comprehends complete-
ly broke in jules de grandin but
your uncle what of him what did he
then do

  you cant use cavalry in wooded ter-
rain and the forest came down thick
each side the road besides my uncle
had but two men with him and to at-
tempt a sortie would have meant sure
death accordingly he waited till the
procession filed past then hurried back
to his command and led them toward the
burning-ghat this lay in a depression
by the river bank so that the partly
burned corpses could be conveniently
thrown into the stream when cremation
rites were finished the hindoos had a
quarter-hour start but that was just as
well as they took more time than that
to make their preparations the funeral
pyre had been erected and over it they
poured a quantity of sandal-oil and
melted butter paraffin was not so com-
mon in the orient those days

  when all had been prepared they
took the dead mans costly garments off
and stripped the widow of her jewels and
gorgeous sari wrapping each of them in
plain white cotton cloth like winding-
sheets and pouring rancid butter over
them they laid the corpse upon the
pyre and marched the widow seven times
around it with a lighted torch held in her
hand then they lifted her up to the
pyre for the poor kid still was only semi-
conscious made her squat cross-legged
and laid the dead mans head upon her
knees a brahmin gave the signal and
the dead mans eldest son ran forward
with a torch to set the oil-soaked wood
afire when my uncle rode out from the
woods and ordered them to halt he
spoke hindustani fluently and there was
no mistaking what he said when he told
them that the raj had banned suttee and

commanded them to take the widow
down

  the thing the blighters didnt know
was that nineteen afghan cavalrymen
were waiting in the underbrush praying
as hard as pious men could pray that the
hindoos would refuse to heed my uncles
orders

  allah heard their prayers for the
only answer that the brahmins gave was
a chorus of shrill curses and a barrage
of stones and cow-dung the dead mans
son ran forward to complete the rite but
before he could apply the torch my uncle
drew his pistol and shot him very neatly
through the head

  then all hell broke loose the guard
of honor brought their muskets into play
and fired a volley wounding several of
the crowd and cutting branches from the
trees behind my uncle but when they
drew their swords and rushed at him it
was no laughing-matter for there must
have been two hundred of them and
those fellows are mean hands with the
bare steel

   troop advance draw sabers trot
gallop charge when the natives heard
my uncles order they halted momentar-
ily and it would have been a lot more
healthy if theyd turned and run for be-
fore they could say knife the afghans
were among em and the fat was in the
fire

   yah allah allah-allah cried
the subadar and his men gave tongue to
the pack-cry that men of the north coun-
try have used when hunting lowland
hindoos since the days when moslem
missionaries first converted afghanistan

  there were only nineteen of them
and my uncle while the hindoos must
have totaled half a thousand but-the
pride an honest man takes in his trade
shone in his eyes as pemberton grinned
at us-you dont need more than twenty
professional soldiers to scatter a mob of
flames of vengeance



scum like that any more than you need
even numbers when you set the beagles
on a flock of rabbits

  a merveille de grandin cried i
knew that i should win my bet before
you told us of your uncles actions you
recall i made a wager with myself bien
i bet me that he would not let that lot
of monkey-faces commit murder  res
bon jules de grandin pay me what you
owe solemnly he extracted a dollar
from his trouser pocket passed it from
his right hand to his left and stowed it
in his waistcoat and now-the curse
he prompted

  quite so the curse they took sarastai
from the funeral pyre and carried her to
safety at the station but before they went
a guru put a curse on all of them none
should die in bed he swore moreover
none of them should ever take inher
itance of land or goods till kinsman had
shed kinsmans blood upon the land to be
inherited

  and the maledictions seemed to
work he ended gloomily my uncle
albert married sarastai shortly after he
had rescued her and though she was as
beautiful as any english girl he found
that he was ostracized and had to give
up his commission english folk were no
more cordial when he brought his tar-
brush bride back home to surrey so he
emigrated to the states fought the full
four years cf your great civil war and
founded what has since become one of
the largest fortunes in new jersey still
see the toll the thing has taken not one
of albert pembertons descendants has
long enjoyed the estate which he built
and death by fire has come to all his
heirs looks as if im next in line

  de grandin looked at him with nar-
rowed eyes death by fire monsieur

  quite foxcrofts been burned down
eight times and every time it burned
one or more of albert pembertons

descendants died the first fire killed old
albert and his wife the second took his

eldest son and-

  one would think rebuilding with ma-
terials impervious to fire would have oc-
curred to them-

c tt a our visitors short laugh was
far from mirthful it did sir
in  robert pemberton rebuilt fox-
croft of stone with cement walls and
floors he was sitting in his libry alone
at night when the curse took him no
fire was burning on the hearth for it was
early summer but somehow the hearth-
rug got afire and the flames spread to the
armchair where he dozed they found
him burned almost to a crisp next
morning cyril pemberton from whom
i take the estate died in his motorcar
three months ago the thing caught fire
just as he drove in the garage and he
fried like an eel before he could so much
as turn the handle of the door

  see here doctor de grandin youve
just got to help me when little jim was
born i resigned from the army so i could
be with avis and the kid i bought a
little farm in hampshire and had settled
down to be a country gentleman of sorts
when cyril died and news of this in-
heritance came i sold the farm off at a
loss to raise funds to come here if i fail
to meet the wills provisions and com-
plete the twelve months residence im
ruined utterly you see the fix im in
completely jules de grandin nod-
ded is there any other of your family
who could claim this estate

  hm yes there is ive a distant
cousin named john ritter who might be
next in line we were at harrow to-
gether jolly rotten chap he was too
sen down from oxford when they
caught him cheatin in a game o cards
fired out o the indian civil administra-
tion for a lack of recognition of meum


weird tales

el tuum where other fellows wives were
concerned now if avis and i dont
make good and live in this old rookery
for a full twelve months we forfeit our
succession and the whole estate goes to
this bounder not that he could make

much use of it but-

  how so is he uninterested in
money

  oh hes interested enough but hes
in jail

  hein in durance

  quite in a bombay jail doin a life
stretch for killin an outraged husband
in a brawl jolly lucky he was that the
jury didnt bring him in guilty of wilful
murder tob

  one secs and how long have you
resided at foxcroft

  just six weeks sir and some dam
queer things have taken place already

 by example-

  our first night there the bedroom
furniture caught fire my wife and i
were sound asleep dog-tired from gcttin
things in shape and neither of us would
have smelled the smoke until it was too
late but laird my scottish terrier was
slcepin by the bed and he raised such a
row he woke us up queer thing about
it too there was no fire laid in the
room and neither avis nor id been
smokin but the bedclothes caught fire
just the same and we didnt have a sec-
onds spare time standin clear two days
later laird died some stinkin blighter
poisoned him

  the second week i was ridin out
from the village with some supplies when
something whizzed past my head almost
cuttin the tip o my nose off when i
dismounted for a look around i found a
knife-blade almost buried in a tree beside
the road

  wed stocked the place with poultry
so that we could have fresh eggs and
every bloomin chicken died we cant

keep a fowl in the hen-house overnight

  not only that weve heard the
damndest noises round the house-
things crashing through the underbrush
bangings at the doors and windows and
the most infernal laughter from the
woods at dead of night its got us nervy
as a lot o cats sir

  my wife and i both want to stick it
as much from principle as for the money
but annie avis old nurse not to men-
tion appleby my batman are all for
chuckin the whole business theyre sure
the curse is workin

  de grandin eyed him thoughtfully
your case has interest monsieur pem-
berton lie said at last if it is conven-
ient doctor trowbridge and i will come
to foxcroft tomorrow afternoon

  we shook hands at the front door
see you tomorrow afternoon i prom-
ised as our caller turned away if any-
thing-

  w hir-r-r-rr something flashing silver-
gray beneath the street lamps light came
hurtling past my head and a dull thud
sounded as the missile struck the panel
of the door

  ha scelerat coqum assassin cried
de grandin rushing out into the dark-
ened street i have you

  but he was mistaken the sound of
flying footsteps pounding down the street
and vanishing around the corner was the
sole clue to the mystery

breathing hard with rage as much as
from exertion he returned and
wrenched the missile from my scarred
front door it was the blade of a cheap
iron knife such as may be bought at any
ten-cent store its point and edges ground
to razor sharpness its wooden helve re-
moved and the blade-heel weighted with
ten ounces of crude lead roughly welded
on

  ah-ha the little frenchman mur-
flames of vengeance



mured as he balanced the crude weapon
in his palm ah-ha-ha one begins to
understand tell me monsieur was the
other knife thrown at you like this one
yes sir just exactly gasped the
englishman

  one sees one comprehends one un-
derstands you may be out of india my
friend but you are not away from it
what dye mean

  me i have seen the knife-blade
weighted in this manner for assassina-
tion but only in one place

  where asked pemberton and i in
chorus

  in the interior of burma this weap-
on is as much like those used by dakaits
of upper burma as one pea is like an-
other in the pod tell me monsieur le
capitaine did you ever come to grips
with them in india

  no sir pemberton replied all my
service was in the south i never got
over into burma

  and you never had a quarrel with
indian priests or fakirs

   positive fact is i always rather liked
the beggars and got on with em first
rate

  this adds the moutarde piquante to
our dish the coincidence of strange
deaths you relate might be the workings
of a fakirs curse this knife is wholly
physical and very deadly it would seem
we are attacked on two sides by super-
physical assailants operating through the
thought-waves of that old ones mal-
edictions and by some others who have
reasons of their own for wishing you to
be the center f attraction at a funeral
good-night again monsieur and a
healthy journey home

foxcroft lay among the mountains
almost at the pennsylvania border
and after consulting road maps we voted
to go there by train it was necessary to

change cars at a small way station and
when the local finally came we found
ourselves unable to get seats together
fortunately for me there was a vacant
place beside a window and after stow-
ing my duffle in the rack i settled down
to read an interesting but not too plaus-
ible article on the use of tetraiodophenol-
phthalein in the diagnosis of diseases of
the gall bladder

  glancing up from my magazine once
or twice while the baggage car was being
filled i noticed several young yokels
white and black lounging on the station
platform and wondered idly why two
young negroes failed to join the laugh-
ing group instead they seemed intent on
something down the track finally rose
from the luggage truck on which they
lounged and walked slowly toward the
train beneath the window where i sat
they paused a moment and i noticed they
were thin almost to emaciation with
skins of muddy brown rather than the
chocolate of the negro full-blood their
hair too was straight as wire and their
eyes slate-gray rather than the usual
brown of africans

  odd-looking chaps i mused as i
resumed my reading

  like most trains used in strictly local
service ours was composed of the rail-
ways almost cast-off stock doors would
not stay shut windows would not open
before wed gone two miles the air with-
in our coach was almost fetid i rose
and staggered up the swaying aisle to
get a drink of water only to find the
tank was empty after several unsuccess-
ful efforts i succeeded in forcing back
the door to the next coach and was in-
serting a cent in the cup-vending machine
when a furious hissing forward told me
someone had yanked the emergency cord
the train came to a bumping stop within
its length and i stumbled back to our
coach to find de grandin a trainman and


weird tales

several passengers gathered in a knot
about the seat i had just vacated

  this is hideux my friend the little
frenchman whispered observe him if
you please

  i looked and turned sick at the sight
the big countryman who had shared the
seat with me was slumped down on the
green-plush covered bench his throat so
deeply gashed the head sagged horribly
upon one shoulder a spate of blood
from a severed jugular smeared clothing
seat and floor the window beside which
id sat was smashed to slivers and bits
of broken glass lay all around

  how-what- i stammered and

for answer jules de grandin pointed to
the floor midway in the aisle lay some-
thing that gleamed dully the counter-
part of the lead-weighted blade which
had been thrown at pemberton as he left
my house the night before

  good heavens i exclaimed if i

hadnt gone for water-

  alais out de grandin interrupted
for the first time in a long and useful
life i find that i can say a word for water
as a beverage undoubtlessly that knife
was meant for you my friend

  but why

  are you not a friend of monsieur
pembertons

  of course but-

  no buts friend trowbridge con-
sider there were two of those assassins
at your house last night at least i judge
so from the noise they made in flight
you stood directly in the light from the
hall lamp when we bid our guest good-
night they must have made a note of
your appearance apparently we have
been under surveillance since then and it
is highly probable they heard us say that
we would visit him today voila

  we descended from the car and
walked along the track regardez-vous

he ordered as we reached the window
where i had been seated

  upon the car-side was the crude out-
line of a grinning skull drawn in white
crayon

  good lord-those brown men at the
station i jerked out they must have
drawn this-it seemed to me they were
not negroes-

  but no but yes he nodded in agree-
ment indubitably they were not afri-
cans but burmans and very bad ones
too this skull is the official signet of the
goddess kali patron deity of thags and
the cult of thaggee makes its head-
quarters in burma it is useless to at-
tempt to apprehend the thrower of the
knife by now he has had time to run
half-way to burma but it behooves us
to be careful how we step we know
not where to look for it or when the
blow will fall but deadly peril walks
with us from this time on i do not think
this task which we have undertaken is a
very healthy one my friend

dressed in shabby oxford bags and a
khaki shooting-coat pemberton was
waiting for us at the little railway sta-
tion

  cheerio he greeted as we joined
him all quiet on the jolly old potomac
what

  decidedly de grandin answered
then told him of the tragedy

  by jove our host exclaimed im
shot if i dont feel like cutting the whole
rotten business taking chances is all
right for me just part of the game
but to lug my wife into this hornets

nest- he cranked the antiquated

flivver standing by the platform and we
drove in moody silence through the
groves of black-boughed whispering
pines that edged the roadway

  british genius for getting order out of
chaos was evident as we arrived at fox-
flames of vengeance



croft the straggling lawn was neatly
trimmed the raffish privet hedge was
clipped on the small grass plot were
several wicker chairs with brightly col-
ored sailcloth cushions a line of lush-
green weeping willows formed a back-
ground for the weather-mellowed ivy-
covered house with its many gables mul-
lioned windows and projecting bays as
we chugged and wheezed between the
tall posts of the gateless entranceway a
young woman quit a gayly-colored canvas
hammock and walked toward us waving
cheerful greeting

  dont say anything about what hap-
pened on the train please begged pem-
berton as he brought the coughing motor
to a halt

  though definitely brunette avis pem-
berton was just as definitely british she
had wide-spaced slightly slanting hazel
eyes straight dark hair smoothly parted
in the middle and drawn low across her
ears a broad white forehead a small
straight nose set above a full-lipped
rather wide and humorous mouth and a
small and pointed diin marked with the
faint suspicion of a cleft when she
smiled two dimples showed low in her
cheeks making a merrily incongruous
combination with her exotic eyes she
was dressed in a twin sweater combina-
tion a kilted skirt of harris tweed shet-
land socks and a pair of scotch grain
brogues which clumsy as they were
could not disguise the slimness of her
feet every line of her was long fine-
cut and british as a breath of lavender

  hullo-hullo old thing her husband
greeted anything untoward occur while
the good old bread-winner was off

  nothing lord and master she an-
swered smilingly as she acknowledged
his quick introductions but her hazel
eyes were wide and thoughtful as the
little frenchman raised her fingers to his
lips at presentation and i thought i saw

her cast a frightened glance across her
shoulder as her husband turned to help
us drag our duffle from the car

  dinner was a rite at foxcroft as din-
ner always is with britons a flat bou-
quet of roses graced the table four tall
candles flickered in tall silver standards
the soup was cool and underseasoned the
joint of mutton tough and underdone
the burgundy a little sour the apple tart
a sadly soggy thing which might have
made a billy-goat have nightmares but
pemberton looked spick and span in din-
ner clothes and his wife was a misty
vision in rose lace appleby the bat-
man who served pemberton as servant
through three army terms and quit the
service to accompany him in civil life
served the meal with faultless technique
and brought us something he called
coffee when the meal was over and we
congregated on the lawn beneath a
spreading poplar tree de grandins air
of gloom grew deeper by the minute
when the servant tendered him a sevres
cup filled with the off-brown faintly
steaming mixture i thought he would
assault him instead he managed some-
thing like a smile as he turned to our
hostess

  i have heard monsieur pemberton
speak of your son madame is he with
you in america he asked

  oh dear no hes with my father at
lerwick-on-tyne you sec we didnt
know just what conditions here might
be and thought that hed be safer at the
vicarage

  your father is a churchman then
very much so it was not till after
we had little jim that he managed to
forgive me even now im not quite sure
that he regards me as a proper person to
have custody of a small boy

  madame i am confused how is it

you say-

  the girl laughed merrily fathers


weird tales

terribly low church and mid-victorian
he classes foreigners and anglo-catho-
lics heathens actors and theosophists
together when i joined a troupe of
unit dancers at the palace he said public
prayers for me when i went out to the
colonies to dance he disowned me as a
vagabond i met big jim while dancing
in bombay and when i wrote id mar-
ried him the only answer father sent was
a note congratulating me on having
found an officer and gentleman to make
an honest woman of me i almost died
when little jim was born and the doc-
tors said i could not stand the indian
climate so big jim gave up his commis-
sion and we all went back to england
father wouldnt see us for almost a year
but when we finally took our baby to him
for baptism he capitulated utterly hes
really an old dear when you penetrate
his shell but if he ever saw me do an
indian dance-

  youd have to start from scratch
again old thing her husband chuckled
as he lit his pipe

  she used to sneak off every chance
she got and take instructions from the
native dancers got so perfect in the
technique that if shed been a little
darker-skinned she could have passed in
any temple as a deva-dasi-by jove i
say he looked at her as though he saw
her for the first time

  what is it jim

  i say you know i never noticed it
before but theres a look about you like
sarastai fine and beautiful and all that
sort of-

  oh jim darling stop it anyone
would think-whats that

   elp elp somebody - elp the
shriek came from the house behind us
each quavering syllable raw-edged with
terror

we rushed around the angle of the
building through the neatly plant-
ed kitchen garden and up the three low
steps that reached the kitchen door

  what is it-who is here cried de
grandin as we paused upon the big
rooms threshold

  in the corner farthest from the door
crouched an aged woman or perhaps i
should have said a creature with a
womans body but a face like nothing
human seamed and lined with countless
wrinkles yellowed teeth bared in a
senseless grin she squatted by an open
casement elbows stiffly bent hands hang-
ing loosely as a begging terrier might
hold its paws and mouthed and gibbered
at us as we stared

  good god our host ejaculated

annie-

  annie oh my poor dear annie
cried our hostess as she rushed across the
lamplit kitchen and threw her arms
around the human caricature crouching in
the angle of the wall whats wrong
with her she called across her shoul-
der as she hugged the mouthing crone
against her bosom whats-o god
shes mad

  the woman cringed away from the
encircling arms you wont urt ole
annie will ee she whimpered you
wont let the black man get er see-
she bared a skinny forearm- e urt
me e urt me with a shiny thing

  de grandin drew his breath in sharply
as he examined the tiny wound which
showed against the womans wrinkled
skin up to the elbow mes amis he
told us solemnly we have stepped in it
up to the elbow me i know this mark
but yes i have seen him before the
devotees of kali sometimes shoot a serum
in a victims arm with such results i
know not what this serum is-and prob-
ably no white man does-but the indian
police know it whom the gods destroy
flames of vengeance



they first make mad is no idle proverb
with the thags of burma non there is
no antidote for it this poor one will be
gone by morning meantime-he put
his hands beneath the womans arms and
raised her-she might as well die in bed
in christian fashion will you lead us
to her room friend pemberton

  de grandin on one side i on the
other we half led half carried the chuck-
ling weeping crone along the passage-
way a gust of wind swung the long
casement open and i crossed to close it
from the night outside where thickly
growing rhododendron shut the moon-
light out there came a laugh like that the
fiends of hell might give at the arrival
of a new consignment of lost souls ha-
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

  sacre nom ill make you laugh upon
the other side of your misshapen face
de grandin cried dropping the old
womans arm and rushing to the window
where he leant across the sill and poured
the contents of his automatic pistol at the
shadows whence the ghostly laughter
came

  a crash of twigs and the flapping-
back of displaced branches answered and
from the further distance came an echo
of the wild malignant cachinnation
f ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

 a nd now my friends it is for us to
formulate our strategy de grandin
told us as we finished breakfast from
the things which we have seen and heard
id say we are beset by human and sub-
human agencies possibly working inde-
pendently more probably in concert
first of all i must go to the village to
make some purchases and notify the cor-
oner of your late lamented servants
death i shall return but-he cast the
phantom of a wink at me-not for
luncheon

  he was back a little after noon with a

large impressive bundle which clanked
mysteriously each time he shifted it
when the papers were removed he
showed a set of heavy padlocks each
complete with hasp and staple together
we went round the big house fixing locks
at doors and windows testing fastenings
repeatedly finally when our task was
done repairing to the lawn where apple-
by awaited us with a teacart-load of
toasted muffins strawberry preserve and
steaming oolong

   what was in that old beer bottle that
you stood beside the bed i asked it
looked like ordinary water

   water yes he answered with a grin
but not ordinary i assure you i have
the-what you call him-hunch-my
friend tonight perhaps tomorrow we
shall have use for what i brought out
from the village

  but what-

   hullo there ready for a spot of tea
called pemberton im famished and
the little womans just about to haul her
colors down

  you are distrait madame de gran-
din asked dropping into a willow chair
and casting a suspicious glance upon the
tray of muffins appleby extended

   indeed i am ive been feeling devils
all day long she smiled at him a little
wearily above her teacup rim some-
things seemed to boil up in me-its
the queerest thing but ive had an urge
to dance an almost irresistible impulse to
put an indian costume on and do the
bramara-the bee-dance i know its
dreadful to feel so with poor old annies
body lying by the wall and this menace
hanging over us but something seems to
urge me almost past resistance to put my

costume on and dance-

  tiens madame one comprehends
he smiled agreement i too have felt
these so queer urges regardez sil vous
plait we are beset by mental stress we


weird tales

look about us for escape and there seems
none then suddenly from somewhere
comes an urge unbidden perhaps it is to
take a drink of tea maybe we feel im-
pelled to walk out in the rain quite pos-
sibly the urge comes to sit down and
strum at the piano or as in your case to
dance reason is a makeshift thing at
best we have used it but a scant half-
million years our instincts reach back
to the days when we crawled in primeval
ooze trust instinct madame something
boils within you you declare tres bien
it is your ego seeking liberation permit
the boiling to continue then when the
effete matter rises to the top we skim
him off-with his hand he made a ges-
ture as of scooping something up-and
throw him out v oil a we have got rid
of that which worries us

  you think i should give way to it

  but certainly of course why not
this evening after dinner if you still
have the urge to dance we shall delight
to watch you and applaud your art

tea finished appleby de grandin
and i set out on a reconnaissance
we walked across the grass plot to the
copse of evergreens from which the
weird laughter came the night before and
searched the ground on hands and knees
our search was fruitless for pine needles
lay so thick upon the ground that nothing
like a footprint could be found

  behind the house stood barn and hen-
coops the latter empty pembertons
archaic flivver and two saddle-horses ten-
anting the former its queer the place
should be so much run down considering
the familys wealth i murmured as we
neared the stable

  the former howner was a most hex-
centric man sir appleby supplied  e
never seemed to care about the plyce and
didnt live ere hany more than necessry
hive eard e honly used hit as a sort o

-my gawd wots that he pointed to
a little mound of earth beside the barn
foundation

  de grandin took a step or two in the
direction of the little hillock then
paused his small nose wrinkled in dis-
gust it has the perfume of corrup-
tion he remarked

  wy hits pore hold laird the mas-
ters dawg sir appleby returned ex-
citedly whos done this thing to im
hi dug is gryve meself sir wen we
found im dead hand hi took particlar
pynes to myke hit deep hand strong
eaped a thumpin boulder hon im sir

hi did but now-

  one sees and smells de grandin in-
terrupted he has been resurrected but
not restored to life

  the cockney leant above the violated
grave to push the earth back in picked
clean e is sir he reported  e couldnt
be no cleaner hif a stinkin buzzard ad
been hat im

  the little frenchman tweaked the
needle points of his wheat-blond mus-
tache between a thoughtful thumb and
forefinger it is possible-quite prob-
able he murmured they have im-
ported every other sort of devilment why
not this one

  what i demanded whos im-
ported what-

  zut we have work to do my friend
do you begin here at this spot and walk
in ever-widening circles eventually un-
less i miss my guess you will come upon
the tracks of a large dog when you have
found them call me if you please

  i followed his instructions while he
and appleby walked toward the house

  in fifteen or twenty minutes i reached
a patch of soft earth where pine needles
did not lie too thick to cover tracks
and there plain as the cannibals mark
on the sands of crusoes island showed
the paw-print of a giant dog
flames of vengeance



  hullo de grandin i began ive
found-

  a crashing in the undergrowth near
by cut short my hail and i drew the
pistol which de grandin had insisted that
i carry as the thing or person neared me

  the rhododendron brandies parted as
a pair of groping hands thrust forth and
appleby came staggering out th black
un sir he gasped in a hoarse voice
hi passed im fore i knew it sir then
seen is turban shinin hin th leaves
i myde to shoot im but e stuck me
with a forked stick him a-dyin sir
a-dy-

  he dropped upon the grass the fatal
word half uttered made one or two
convulsive efforts to regain his feet then
slumped down on his face

  de grandin i called frenziedly i
say de grandin-

  he was beside me almost as i finished
calling and together we cut the poor
chaps trouser leg away disclosing two
small parallel pin-pricks in the calf of his
left leg a little spot of ecchymosis like
the bruise left by a blow was round the
wounds and beyond it showed an area
of swelled and reddened skin almost
like a scald when de grandin made a
small incision with his knife in the
bruised flesh then pressed each side the
wounds the blood oozed thickly almost
like a semi-hardened gelatin

  cest fini he pronounced as he rose
and brushed his knees he did not have
a chance that poor one this settles it

  what settles what

  this parbleu if we needed further
proof that we are menaced by a band of
desperate dakaits we have it now it
is the mark and sign-manual of the
criminal tribes of burma the man is
dead of cobra venom-but these wounds
were not made by a snakes fangs

t ut good heavens man if this keeps
a- up there wont be one of us to tell
the tale cried pemberton as we com-
pleted ministering to applebys remains
twice they almost got me with their
knives they almost murdered doctor
trowbridge theyve done for annie and
poor appleby-

  exactement de grandin nodded
but this will not keep up tonight this
very evening we shall call their prom-
ontory-non i mean their bluff the co-
incidences of your kinsmens deaths by
fire those might have been attributed to
hindoo curses myself i think they are
but these deliberate murders and at-
tempts at murder are purely human do-
ings your cousin monsieur ritter-

  not an earthly pemberton smiled
grimly did you ever see a british
indian jail not quite as easy to walk
out of em as it is from an american
prison-

  notwithstanding which monsieur
-the little frenchman smiled sarcastical-
ly-this monsieur ritter is at large and
probably within a gun-shot of us now
when i was in the village this forenoon
i cabled the police at bombay the
answer came within three hours

   john ritter serving a life term escaped four
months ago his whereabouts unknown

  you see his jai -break almost coin-
cided with the passing of your kinsman
in america he knew about the family
curse undoubtlessly and determined to
make profit by it but he was practical
that one mais oui he did not intend to
wait the working of a curse which might
be real or only fanciful not he by blue
he bought the service of a crew of
burman cutthroats and they came with
all their bag of villains tricks-their
knives their subtle poisons even an
hyena that it was your servants and not
you who met their deaths is not attribut-

able to any kindness on his part but
merely to good fortune your turns will

come unless-

  unless we hook it while we have the
chance

  unless you do exactly as i say de
grandin finished without notice of the
interruption in five minutes it will be
ten oclock i suggest we seek our rooms
but not to sleep you monsieur and
you madame will see that both your
doors and windows are securely fastened
meantime doctor trowbridge and i will
repair to our chamber and-eh bien i
think we shall see things

despite de grandins admonition i
fell fast asleep how long id slept
i do not know nor do i recall what wak-
ened me there was no perceptible
sound but suddenly i was sitting bolt-
upright staring fascinated at our win-
dows shadowed oblong lucky thing
we put those locks on i reassured my-
self almost anything might-

  the words died on my tongue and a
prickling sensation traced my spine
what it was i did not know but every
sense seemed warning me of dreadful
danger

  de grandin i whispered hoarsely

de grandin-

  i reached across the bed to waken him
my hand encountered nothing but the
blanket i was in that tomb-black room
with nothing but my fears for company

  slowly scarcely faster than the hand
that marks the minutes on the clock the
window-sash swung back the heavy lock
wed stapled on was gone or broken i
heard the creak of rusty hinges caught
the faint rasp of a bar against the outer
sill and my breath went hot and sulfur-
ous in my throat as a shadow scarcely
darker than the outside night obscured
the casement

  it was like some giant dog-a mastiff

or great dane-but taller heavier with
a mane of unkempt hair about its neck
pointed ears cocked forward great eyes
gleaming palely phosphorescent it
pressed against the slowly yielding win-
dow-frame and now i caught the sil-
houette of its hog-snouted head against
the window saw its parted sneering lips
smelled the retching stench that emanated
from it and went sick with horror the
thing was a hyena a grave-robber offal-
cater most loathsome of all animals

  slowly inch by cautious inch it crept
into the room fangs bared in a snarl that
held the horrible suggestion of a sneer
help de grandin-help i shrieked
leaping from the bed and dragging
tangled blankets with me as a shield

  the hyena sprang with a cry that
was half growl half obscene parody of a
human chuckle it launched itself through
the intervening gloom and next instant i
was smothered underneath its weight as
it worried savagely at the protecting
blanket

  tfsa-ha monsieur vhyene you seek a
meal take this close above me jules
de grandin swung a heavy kukri knife as
though it were a headsmans ax striking
through the wiry mane driving deep into
the brutes thick neck almost decapitat-
ing lt

  get up my friend arise he ordered
as he hauled me from beneath the bed-
clothes already soaking with the foul
beasts blood me i have squatted none
too patiently behind the bed waiting for
the advent of that one morbleu i
thought that he would never come

  howd you know about it- i

began but he cut me short with a soft
chuckle

  the laughter in the bush that night
the small dogs ravished grave finally
the tracks you found today they made
the case complete i made elaborate show
of opening our window and they must
flames of vengeance



have found the others fastened so they
determined to send their pet before them
to prepare the way he was savage that
one but so am i by blue come let us
tell our host and hostess of our visitor

the next day was a busy one sheriffs
deputies and coroners assistants
came in almost ceaseless streams ques-
tioning endlessly making notes of every-
thing surveying the thicket where apple-
by was killed and the kitchen where old
annie met her fate at last the dreary
routine ended the mortician took away
the bodies and the pembertons faced us
solemn-eyed across the dinner table

  im for chucking the whole rotten
business our host declared theyve

got two of us-

  and we have one of them supplied

de grandin anon we shall have-

  were cutting out of here tomorrow
broke in pemberton ill go to selling
cotton in the city managing estates or
clerking in a shop before ill subject avis
to this peril one more day

  cest ienfant illage declared de
grandin when success is almost in
your hand you would retreat fi done
monsieur

  fi done or otherwise were going in
the morning pemberton replied de-
terminedly

  very well let it be as you desire
meantime have you still the urge to
dance madame

  avis pemberton glanced up from her
teacup with something like a guilty look
more than ever she returned so low
that we could scarcely catch her words

  tres bien since this will be our last
night in the house permit that we enjoy
your artistry

  her preparations were made quickly
we cleared a space in the big drawing-
room rolling back the rugs to bare the
polished umber tiles of which the floor

was made upon a chair she set a small
hand-gramophone needle ready poised
then hurried to her room to don her
costume

  ecoutez sil vous plait de grandin
begged tiptoeing from the drawing-
room returning in a moment with the
water-filled beer bottle which he had
brought from the village the kukri knife
with which he killed the hyena and a
pair of automatic pistols one of these he
pressed on me the other on our host
have watchfulness my friends he
bade in a low whisper when the music
for the dance commences it is likely to
attract an uninvited audience should
anyone appear at either window i beg
you to shoot first and make inquiries
afterward

  hadnt we better close the blinds
i asked because if were likely to be
watched-

  mais non he negatived see there
is no light here save that the central
lamp casts down and that will shine di-
rectly on madame we shall be in
shadow but anyone who seeks to peer in
through the window will be visible
against the moonlight you compre-
hend

  id like to have a final go at em
our host replied even if i got only
one itd help to even things for appleby
and annie

  i quite agree de grandin nodded
now-s-s-sh silence madame comes

  the chiming clink of ankle bells an-
nounced her advent and as she crossed
the threshold with a slow sensuous
walk hips rolling feet flat to floor one
set directly before the other i leant for-
ward in amazement never had i thought
that change of costume could so change a
personality yet there it was in tweeds

weird tales

black-haired figure rippling past us with
the grace of softly flowing water was a
daughter of the gods a temple deva-dasi
the mystery and allure and unfathomable
riddle of the east incarnate her bodice
was of saffron silk sheer as net cut with
short shoulder-sleeves and rounded neck
it terminated just below her small firm
breasts and was edged with imitation
emeralds and small opals which kindled
into witch-fires in the lamplights glow
from breast to waist her slim firm form
was bare slender as an adolescent boys
yet full enough to keep her ribs from
showing in white lines against the creamy
skin a smalt-blue cincture had been
tightly bound about her slender waist
emphasizing gently swelling hips and
supporting a full many-pleated skirt of
cinnabar-red silken gauze across her
smoothly parted blue-black hair was
thrown a sari of deep blue with silver
edging falling down across one shoulder
and caught coquettishly within the curve
of a bent elbow silver bracelets hung
with little hawk-bells bound her wrists
heavy bands of hammered silver with a
fringe of silver tassels that flowed rip-
pling to the floor and almost hid her feet
were ringed about each ankle between
her startlingly black brows there burned
the bright vermilion of a caste mark

pemberton pressed the lever of the
gramophone and a flood of liquid
music flowed into the room deep plain-
tive chords came from the guitar the
viols wept and crooned by turns and the
drums beat out an amatory rhythm she
paused a moment in the swing-lamps
golden disk of light feet close together
knees straight arms raised above her
head wrists interlaced the right hand
facing left the left turned to the right
and each pressed to the other palm to
palm and finger against finger the
music quickened and she moved her feet

in a swift shuffling step setting ankle
bells a-chime swaying like a palm tree
in the rising breeze she took the folds
of her full skirt between joined thumbs
and forefingers daintily as one might
take a pinch of snuff spread the gleam-
ing many-pleated tissue out fanwise and
advanced with a slow gliding step her
head bent sidewise now toward this sleek
shoulder now toward that then slowly
it sank back her long eyes almost closed
like those of one who falls into a swoon
of unsupportable delight her red lips
parted fell apart as though they had
gone flaccid with satiety after ecstasy
then she dropped forward in a deep
salaam head bent submissively both
hands upraised with thumbs and fore-
fingers together

  i was about to beat my hands to-
gether in applause when de grandins
grip upon my elbow halted me les
jlammes mon ami regardez-vous-les
famines he whispered

  across the vitric umber tiles that made
the floor a line of flame was rising
flickering and dancing wavering flaunt-
ing advancing steadily and i could smell
the spicy-sweet aroma of burnt sandal-
wood it is the flame from that old
cheated funeral pyre he breathed the
vengeance-flame that burned the old one
to a crisp while he lay in a fireproof
room the flame that set this house afire
eight times the flame of evil genius that
pursues this family see how easily i con-
quer it

  with an agile leap he crossed the
room raised the bottle he had brought
and spilled a splash of water on the
crackling leaping fire-tongues it was
as if a picture drawn in chalks were
wiped away or an image on a motion-
picture screen obliterated as the light be-
hind the film dies for everywhere the
drops of water fell the flames died into
blackness with a sullen scolding hiss

                     w t-
flames of vengeance



back and forth across the line of fire he
hurried throwing water on the fluttering
dazzling flares till all were dead and cold

  the window mes amis look to the
window shoot if you see faces he
ordered as he fought the dying fire

  both pemberton and i looked up as
he called out and i felt a sudden tighten-
ing in my throat as my eyes came level
with the window framed in the panes
were three faces two malignant brown
and scowling one a sun-burned white
but no less savage the dark men i re-
membered instantly it was they who
stood beside the train the day the knife
was thrown to kill the man who shared
the seat with me but the frowning curs-
ing white man was a stranger

  even as i looked i saw one of the
brown men draw his hand back and
caught the glimmer of a poised knife-
blade i raised my pistol and squeezed
hard upon the trigger but the mechan-
ism jammed and i realized the knife-
man had me at his mercy

  but pembertons small weapon an-
swered to his pressure and the stream of
w t-

bullets crashed against the glass sent it
shattering in fragments and bored
straight through the scowling coun-
tenances making little sharp-edged pits
in them like those a stream of sprinkled
water makes when turned upon damp
clay except that where these little pock-
marks showed there spread a smear of
crimson

  there was something almost comic in
the look of pained surprize the faces
showed as the storm of bullets swept
across them almost it seemed to me
they voiced a protest at an unexpected
trick as though theyd come to witness
an amusing spectacle only to discover
that the joke was turned on them and
they had no relish for the role of victim

es its ritter all right pember-

  jl ton pronounced as we turned the
bodies over in the light of an electric
torch of course he was a filthy rotter
and all that but-hang it all its tough
to know you have a kinsmans blood
upon your hands even if-

  parbleu tu paries mon ami-youve
said it cried de grandin in delight


weird tales

the ancient curse has been fulfilled the
wicked ones condition met a kinsman
has shed kinsmans blood upon the prop-
erty inherited

 why-

   why be doubled-damned and
stewed in satans sauce-pan i tell you it
is so he swung his arm in an all-com-
prehensive gesture we have at once
disposed of everything my friend the
human villains who would murder you
and madame pemberton the working of
the ancient curse pronounced so many
years ago-all are eliminated

  he leant above the body of a prostrate
indian searching through his jacket with
careful fingers ah-ba behold him he
commanded here is the thing that
killed your so unfortunate retainer he
held a length of bamboo stick fitted at
the end with something like a tuning-
fork to which a rubber bulb was fixed
careful he warned as i readied out to
touch it the merest prick of those sharp
points is certain death

  pressing the queer instrument against
the wall he pointed to twin spots of
visdd yellow liquid sticking to the
stones cobric acid-concentrated es-
sence of the cobras venom he ex-
plained one drives these points into
his victims body-the sharp steel pen-
etrates through clothing where a snakes
fangs might not pierce - and pouf
enough snake-poison goes into the poor
bnes veins to cause death in three
minutes tiens it is a clever little piece
of devilment riest-ce-pas

  dye think we got em all asked
pemberton

  indubitably had there been more
they would have been here consider
first they set their foul beast on us
believing he will kill some one of us at
least he does not return and they are
puzzled could it be that we disposed
of him they do not know but they are

worried anon they hear the strains of
indian music in the house this are not
the way things had been planned by
them there should be no celebration
here they wonder more and come to
see what happens they observe madame
concluding her so lovely dance they also
sec us all unharmed and are about to use
their knives when you forestall them
with your pistol

  but there were two burmese at the
railway station the other day yet some-
one threw the knife intended to kill doc-
tor trowbridge objected pemberton
that would indicate a third one in re-
serve-

  de grandin touched the white mans
sprawling body with the tip of his small
shoe there was my friend and this is
he he answered shortly your charm-
ing cousin monsieur ritter it was he
who hid beside the tracks and hurled the
knife when he beheld the mark of kali
the burmans knew friend trowbridge
had it been one of them who lay in am-
bush he would not have wasted knife or
energy in killing the wrong man but
ritter had no other guide than the skull
chalked on the car tenez he threw the
knife that killed the poor young man to
death

  how do you account for the fire that
broke out just as mrs pemberton had
finished dancing i asked

  there is no scientific explanation for
it at least no explanation known to
modern chemistry or physics we must
seek deeper-farther-for its reason
those hindoo gurus they know things
they can cast a rope into the air and
make it stand so rigidly that one may
climb it they take a little tiny seed and
place it in the earth and there before
your doubting eyes it grows and puts
forth leaves and flowers me i have seen
them take a piece of ordinary wood-my
walking-stick parbleu - make passes

over it and make it burst in flames now
if their ordinary showmen can do things
like that how much more able are their
true adepts to bring forth fire at will or
on the happening of specific things the
rescue of the hindoo girl sarastai left
the funeral pyre without a victim and so
the old priests placed a curse on her and
hers decreeing fire should take its toll
of all her husbands family till kinsman
had shed kinsmans blood that was the
fire that followed every generation of the
pembertons this fire burned this house
again and yet again burned one when he
lay in safety in a fireproof room-even
set a motorcar afire to kill the late pro-
prietor of the estate

  tonight conditions were ideal the
sacred music of the temple sounded
from the gramaphone madame avis
danced in hindoo costume danced an
old old dance perhaps the very dance
sarastai used to dance our thoughts were
tuned to india-indeed there is no doubt
the urge which prompted madame pem-
berton to dance a hindoo dance in hin-
doo costume came directly from the
thought-waves set in motion by those old
priests in the days of long ago the very
stones of this old house are saturated in
malignant thought-waves-thoughts of
vengeance - and madame avis was
caught up in them and forced along the
pathway toward destruction all was pre-
pared conditions were ideal the victims
waited ready for the flames only one
thing that old priest forgot to foresee

  jolly interestin murmured pem-
berton what was it he forgot

  that you would ask advice of jules
de grandin my little friend grinned
shamelessly there it was he missed his
trick i am very clever i looked the sit-
uation over and saw we were confronted
by both physical and ghostly menaces
for the men we have the sword the

pistol and the fist for the ghostly enemy
we need a subtler weapon

  accordingly when i go to the village
to obtain the locks for doors and win-
dows i also stop to visit with the cure of
the little church fortunately he is irish
and i do not have to waste a day convinc-
ing him mon pere i say we are con-
fronted with the devil of a situation a
crew of monkey-faces who give worship
to the wicked ones of india are menacing
a christian family they will undoubt-
lessly attempt to burn them up with fire
-not ordinary fire but fire they make by
wicked sinful heathen incantations
now for ordinary fire we use the or-
dinary water what should we use to put
out fire that comes from hell or hells
assistants

  that old priest smiles at me he is
no fool my son he say long long
ago the fathers of the church discovered
that it is hot work to fight the devil with
fire therefore they invent holy water
how much of it will you be needing for
your work

  he was a good and hospitable man
that priest he had no whisky in the
house but he had beer so we made a
lunch of beer and cheese and biscuit and
when we finish we clean a bottle out
and fill him to the neck with eau benite

   bonjour mon fils the old priest
say and when you win your fight with
satans henchmen remember that our
church could use a new baptismal font
you will remember that i trust mon-
sieur when you get your inheritance
by george ill build a new church
for him if he wants it promised pem-
berton

the locomotive gave a long-drawn
mournful wail as the train drew near
the station and the smiling porter hur-
ried through the car collecting luggage

well were home again i remarked
as the train slid to a stop

  yes grace a dieu we have escaped
de grandin answered piously

  it did look pretty bad at times i
nodded especially when that fellow at
the window poised his knife and those
devilish flames began to flicker-

  ah bah  he interrupted scornfully
those things pouf they were not to

be considered i speak of something far
more hideous we have escaped that
dreadful english cooking that cuisine of
the savage that roast of mutton that

inable apple tart

hasten home there a decent drink
awaits us and tonight in hells despite i

hild of atlantis

by edmond hamilton

what brooding shape of horror dwelt in the black castle that topped the
sinister island on which a young american and his wife
were shipwrecked on their honeymoon

the little yawl clove the blue
waters of the sunlit sea its white
sails taut with a strong wind
steadily it crept eastward across the vast
wastes of the atlantic toward the azores
still hundreds of miles away in the cock-
pit at the stern david russell stood over
the wheel his lean brown bareheaded
figure bent forward his smiling gray
eyes watching his wife

  christa russell was earnestly coiling
ropes on the deck forward now she
finished and came back toward him a
slim boyish little figure in white slacks
and blue jersey her soft dark eyes
always oddly serious beneath her childish
forehead and smoothly brushed black
hair met her husbands and returned his
smile

  happy kid he asked his arm
going around her slender waist as she

jumped down into the cockpit to his
side

  she nodded her uplifted eyes adoring
its the best honeymoon anyone ever
had david just you and me and the sea

  he grinned i felt a little guilty about
dragging you on a risky cruise like this
but youve been the best sailing partner
i ever had and the only one who could
really cook

  he added speaking of cooking sup-
pose you get down in that galley and
exercise your talents gal im hungry

  christa said dismayedly oh id for-
gotten all about lunch ill only be a few
minutes

  she disappeared hurriedly down the
companionway left alone david rus-
sell drew a long breath of utter content-
ment his gray eyes swept the horizon
happily sunlight and sea a good boat
child of atlantis



and a good wind and his young wife-
what more could any man want

  they had been married in bermuda
two weeks before and david had pro-
posed this cruise to the azores in his yawl
as a honeymoon fine weather and fa-
voring winds had made it a dream
voyage of sun-drenched days and moon-
silvered nights

  david suddenly stiffened at the wheel
he had glimpsed something just ahead
that was-queer it was a strange great
flicker in the air a wavering of light like
the refraction of air above hot railway

tracks the whole area just ahead of the
onward-racing yawl seemed flickering
oddly like that

  he felt a sudden tinge of dim fear of
alarm he moved his hand on the wheel
to guide the yawl away from that weirdly
flickering area but before he could do
so the speeding boat had run directly
into the edge of the queer area the next
moment-

  a big island loomed dead ahead in the
sea

  it was like hell-born magic to davids
stunned brain one moment he was sail-

he fell with outstretched xnetcd arms crashing purposefully down against tho giant crystal

weird tales

ing with no speck of land in sight in the
vast blue waste next moment without
warning this island had suddenly clicked
into sight not a hundred yards ahead of
the yawl

  davids stupefied eyes glimpsed the
isle as a heavily forested mass of land
several miles across towering to frown-
ing black cliffs at its center the shores
were fringed with cruel jagged rocks
that showed like broken black fangs
through the foam of wild waves break-
ing over them

  the yawl was running headlong onto
these rocks without chance of being
turned in time david his face a gray
mask of stupefied horror dropped the
wheel and yelled hoarsely

  christa quick

  she came darting up the companion-
way face white with alarm david
what-

  he grabbed her at that instant with
terrific grinding shock the yawl struck
the rocks

  they were thrown clear of its wildly
tilting deck by the impact and almost
instantly they were sinking in the roar-
ing waters david still blindly gripping
his wife

thunder of the rushing waves was
in his ears as they went down and
down in the cold currents he shifted his
grip on christa and fought frantically
with his other arm to rise he came up
half strangled to be nearly smothered
by white foam and deafened by the roar-
ing bellow of breaking waves

  they were flung like chips toward the
jagged shore rocks david struck out
with his free arm in mad strokes to keep
them away from the cruel stone fangs
upon which the waves would hammer
them to pulp his left arm still gripped
christa with frantic strength as they were
hurled forward

  his right shoulder grazed hidden rock
his shirt ripping and a brand of fire
seeming to sear along his arm as he was
whirled around by the wild waves that
were tossing them he glimpsed the yawl
piled on the outer rocks being ham-
mered by the smashing waves

  the waves were hurling them on
toward those menacing black teeth with
the swiftness of a mill-race a flat jag-
ged ledge rose a few feet from the foam-
ing waters just ahead the charging
waves flung them hard against it

  david took the impact on his right
shoulder and felt the flesh bruise from
the savage blow with his numbed right
arm he clawed wildly to cling to the
edge of the ledge a foot above his head
his fingertips gained the rim then were
torn loose as the receding waves sucked
the two helpless humans back

  back and back-and then again they
bore them forward like raging stallions
of the sea toward the ledge of rock
david felt his strength leaving him
knew desperately that he could not hold
christa longer that if the waves swept
them back out again they would sink
together

  the rushing waters again flung them
like floating puppets against the rock
davids head hit the wall and he saw
blinding light felt the last remnants of
strength melting from the stunning blow
yet knowledge of death close at hand
made him claw frenziedly for the ledge

  his fingers again gripped its brink--
but his nerveless body had not the
strength to haul them up onto it
through the bellowing din icy death
seemed stooping to enfold them in his
cold shroud then before the waters
sucked back a wave higher than the
others lifted david and the girl a little-
with a supreme effort he used thafi
moment to roll with her onto the ledge

  he lay there hearing only dimly the
child of atlantis



raging of the baffled seas just below him
the splatter of salty spray on his face
he was aware that christa was bending
frantically over him as his consciousness
darkened

  david david dear her sobbing
voice came thinly and remotely to his
fading hearing david were safe now
ill get help-get someone-

  and then there was only darkness in
david russells brain

it was the steady showering of the
stinging spray on his face that finally
revived his overtaxed body and brain
he opened his eyes and weakly struggled
up to a sitting position

  he was still on the ledge at the islands
shore the incoming combers were still
smashing a few inches below him fling-
ing up great geysers of feathery foam
and a hundred yards outward the yawl
lay grinding on the outer rocks where it
had been tossed

  where was christa she was nowhere
in sight along the rocky wave-dashed
shore davids clearing brain remembered
now her frantic attempts to revive him
she had gone to look for help and she
was not back yet how long had she
been gone had something happened to
her on this hellish island that had ap-
peared so magically in the mid-atlantic
cold fear for his bride clutched at
davids heart and forced him to stagger
weakly to his feet wildly he looked
along the shore of the island

  from the sea-beaten jagged rocks a
narrow strip of beach lifted toward the
edge of the dark great forest that seemed
to cover most of the island he saw
tracks in the sand leading toward the
forest christa must have gone that way
he stumbled after her spurred by ap-
prehension this island a mysterious
place that should not be-what danger
might not christa meet on it

  as he toiled up the slight grade of the
beach davids mind was still dazed by
the suddenness with which the whole in-
credible thing had happened this island
had been utterly invisible to his eyes until
the yawl had almost run onto it had
reached the edge of that strange flicker-
ing area then the island had clicked
suddenly into sight

  he turned his head and looked wildly
back out to sea as he hastened on david
received another shock he could not see
more than a few hundred feet out from
the island he could look that far out
over the rocks and waters but beyond
that limit he could see nothing but a
weird flickering his vision seemed to be
repelled at that limit to be turned back
upon itself

 he looked upward the sky had
changed too it was a strange flickering
sky of very dark blue and the sun could
not be seen in it this nightmare island
it could not be seen by anyone outside
it-and neither could anyone on the
island see outside

  it was all crazy incredible but his
dazed mind clung frantically to the
thought of finding christa david
reached the edge of the forest and stood
staring haggardly into its dark depths

  huge black-trunked trees rose for
hundreds of feet mighty columns sup-
porting a canopy of green foliage high
overhead thickets of brush and snaky
creepers that bore enormous white
blooms choked the space between the
trees this forest loomed strangely silent
in the weird sunless day and he saw
beyond the waving tree-tops the tower-
ing central cliffs he had already glimpsed
from the yawl on those distant frown-
ing bluffs of dark rock crouched a mon-
strous square black castle

  david stared and stared over the great
trees at that somber structure of mystery
on the distant heights his gaze fascinated


weird tales

by its black domes and towers and un-
broken windowless walls then he tore
his eyes from it and peered frantically
along the forest edge for some trace of
his wife

  woher kommst du the voice came
from close behind him with startling
unexpectedness

  david spun around two men had
come up behind him on the beach with-
out his observing them they were star-
ing at him suspiciously

  the man who had asked the question
in german was a solidly built sandy-
haired man of forty with searching eyes
he was clad in a time-worn ragged and
stained gray uniform

  the other man was a huge broad-
shouldered scandinavian in sweater and
sea-boots almost as ragged his weather-
beaten viking face a little older than that
of the german his blond head bare
both men carried steel-pointed spears

  david russell said with difficulty i
-i dont understand you then he
cried in gods name what kind of
place is this

  the germans suspicious face cleared
and he exclaimed in english youre
new here then did your ship run onto
the island were any others saved
to his excited questions david an-
swered we were in a yawl-my wife
and i this hellish island suddenly ap-
peared right in front of us our boat
struck-there it is out on the rocks we
got to shore but i passed out and when
i came around christa was gone for
help and now i cant find her ive got
to find her he cried to get her away
from this devilish place

  the german shook his head sadly
there is no escape from this island-
none except death or whatever horrible
fate the master deals out to those whom
he calls to his castle i myself have been
here on the island for twenty years

  twenty years cried david ap-
palled

  the teuton nodded i am leutnant
wilhelm von hausman of u-boat 
of the imperial german navy in the
spring of  our boat running on the
surface to recharge our batteries sighted
a strange flickering just ahead the next
moment this island appeared we crashed
into it and i who was on deck was the
only one saved

  he motioned toward the giant blond
scandinavian seaman this is halfdon
husper first mate of a norwegian
freighter that ran onto the island in 
there are a couple of hundred such sur-
vivors from similar wrecks-we have a
little village over yonder in the forest
david cried but why havent you
tried to get away and what kind of
hellish place is this island anyway that
its completely invisible until youre right
on it

  von hausman shrugged i know no
more than you how the island is made
invisible to the outside world the mas-
ter has made it so but how he does it i
cant guess

  the master repeated david who
is that

  von hausman pointed to the black
castle brooding on the distant cliffs
that is the castle of the master he is
supreme ruler of this island but who or
what he is i cannot say for none of us
who live here have ever seen him

  you mean-he never comes out of
that place david asked wonderingly
but then how do you know he exists
the german shuddered a little we
know well he exists because from time
to time he calls one among us to the
castle and whoever goes into that black
place never comes out again

  the torturing anxiety uppermost ini
davids mind burst forth but whiatf
child of atlantis



about my wife i must find her-at
once

  the big norwegian half don husper
spoke for the first time in rumbling
heavily accented english he said to the
german some other of the men may
have found the girl and taken her to the
village

  von hausman nodded rapidly his
keen eyes narrowing he told david
its possible some of the others took
your wife to the village as halfdon says
i think youd better come with us at
once

half mad with torturing worry
david russell started with the two
ragged men at a trot through the forest
there was a faintly marked trail which
the others appeared to know that wound
inward between the great trees and
around huge fallen logs

  even in the tense stress of his anxiety
he could not help noticing that the trees
and vegetation around him were totally
unfamiliar he had never seen such trees
such huge flowers such grotesque orange-
podded fruits it all seemed like a strange
dream into which he had suddenly been
plunged

  von hausman was telling hina the
village is not far ahead its a miserable
little place where we eke out life by
gathering fruits and hunting the small
animals until the time comes when we
die or the master calls us

  he added somberly almost i wish
sometimes that the master would call me
and put an end to this wretched existence
from which there is no escape

  they emerged soon into a shallow
unwooded valley at the center of the
island at the farther side of the valley
rose the black frowning cliffs upon
whose highest point squatted the brood-
ing ebon castle

  david saw that in the valley lay a rude

village of two or three score huts built
of logs and bark the little village
seemed to huddle there like a thing
crouching in fear beneath the black bat-
tlements of the cliffs and the masters
mysterious castle

  at the center of the village milled an
excited crowd of men the din of their
shouting voices reached david and his
two companions as they hurried forward
the lips of the german u-boat officer
tightened

  its as i feared-theyve got your
wife here he rasped youre probably
going to have to fight

  fight cried david

  von hausman nodded tightly very
few women ever get ashore alive on the
island from the wrecks-only at long in-
tervals and the women go to those who
can fight for them and keep them
quick

  they raced forward between the rows
of rude huts now david saw that there
were perhaps two hundred men in the
throng milling in shouting excitement
ahead he could see only a dozen or so
women - ragged frightened women -
peering out of huts here and there

  but the mob of men a ragged hard-
bitten throng that had been cast ashore
here by the ships of every nation that had
wrecked on this mysterious island red-
faced british sailors brown snake-eyed
lascars stalwart scandinavians like hus-
per swarthy spanish and italian and
portuguese seamen bearded russians and
guttural-voiced teutons a score of other
races all milling excitedly around one
central point

  david russell and his two companions
crashed through the shouting throng
david unnoticed by the ragged mob in
its excitement he burst into a small clear
space at the center of the crowd there
he stopped and shouted aloud

  christa


weird tales

  she was there a slim shrinking boy-
ish figure in her wet slacks and sweater
a stocky simian red-headed man of
thirty with hard blue eyes and a button-
nosed craggy face was holding her
struggling form with one arm he was
shaking his other fist at the crowd and
roaring belligerently i say this girl is
mine i found her there in the forest and
if anyone else wants her he can fight me
for her here and now

a sudden silence descended on the
mob at the redheads roaring chal-
lenge von hausman muttered in
davids ear its red oriley-a gun-
runner whose schooner ran ashore here
ten years ago hes the toughest customer
on the island

  but david wasnt listening flaming
with rage he had burst from the crowd
and with a savage twist tore orileys
arm away from christa and sent the red-
head sprawling

  he gritted damn you this girl isnt
for you or anyone else here shes my
wife

  christa clung to his arm sobbing with
relief david i was afraid you were
dead i went to try to find help and was

caught-

  oriley had got to his feet in a dead
silence of stunned amaement on the part
of the crowd the gun-runners craggy
face split in a wide menacing grin at
david

  so shes your wife is she the red-
headed man mocked harshly thats
a good one she may have been your wife
by law outside but theres devil a law
on this cursed island except what the
strongest man makes im going to tear
you apart and then take her

  the stocky gun-runner was savagely
peeling off his raggd coat and shirt as he
spoke and stood now with gorilla-like

hairy chest bare his great fists balled ad-
vancing slowly on david

  david thrust the white-faced christa
back to von hausman and husper at the
edge of the crowd the ragged mob was
shouting now with increased excitement

  kill him red-tear the young squirt
apart exultant voices bawled

  von hausman told david swiftly
try to finish him before he gets to you
or you wont have a chance

  david stepped out to meet the grimly
advancing oriley as he looked at the
redheads huge shoulders barrel chest
and simian arms davids heart sank
within him he was still half exhausted
from the battle through the waves an
hour before and he knew that even in
the best of condition he would be no
match for oriley yet if he were killed
christas possible fate in this weird
brutal place-the thought filled him with
a wild desperate frenzy

  he suddenly rushed his left fist driv-
ing out with every ounce of his strength
it smashed against orileys craggy jaw
and the irishman rocked for a moment
david leaped in and smashed with right
and left at the redheads face with every-
thing he had and his enemy clawed for
balance

  a wild howl went up from the mob
but davids heart was cold with knowl-
edge that he had hit oriley with every-
thing he had-and had failed to knock
him down with a bear-like snarl of rage
shaking his head as though to clear his
eyes the redhead rushed forward david
tried to sidestep but his foot slipped on
the loose gravel then something hit
him a terrific blow on the mouth and
everything was in a red mist and he was
dimly aware that his back was lying on
the damp ground and that something hot
and sticky was running on his lips and
oriley was standing there snarling
down at him
child of atlantis



  get up get up before i beat you to
death lying there

  david that heartbroken sob was in
christas voice he recognized it through
the mistiness that had seized his brain

  he staggered to his feet lunged for-
ward with fists balled crash the crunch-
ing blows seemed to explode out of
nothing against his face and he knew he
had gone to his knees this time his
brain was rocking-he felt he was done
for there wasnt an ounce of strength
left in his nerveless body

  david that agonized cry again
pierced his numbness of mind and body
making him somehow struggle up again

  as though through crimson fog he
saw orileys snarling face david
hitched drunkenly to one side drove his
right with clumsy aimlessness the blow
connected with something-there was a
grunt of pain from oriley and the big
redhead staggered clutching his solar
plexus

  finish him von hausman was
yelling somewhere in the shouting mob

  david summoned his last spark of
strength swayed forward and jabbed
both clenched fists at a staggering dimly-
seen oriley his fists crashed onto hard
bone with stinging pain-and there was
a wilder shout as oriley slumped from
his feet collapsed to a sitting position
and looked up with stunned half-con-
scious gaze of utter bewilderment

david stumbled over to where von
hausman held christa he was reel-
ing almost unable to stand but he tried
to quiet her sobbing suddenly a great
hand tore him around and he faced one
of the brutal mob a black-bearded
wolf-faced russian

  you fight me now for the girl the
russian grinned evilly i want her too

  von hausmans face flamed with rage
and he cried no bardoff gott in him-

mel this man is dead on his feet you
cant-

  bardoff swept him aside with a growl
and the ragged mob cheered you fight
or i take her the russian growled at
david

  halfdon husper the huge norwegian
shouldered forward with pale eyes blaz-
ing youll fight me first if you try
that he warned bardoff

  and me also snapped von haus-
man

  yes and me too roared a third un-
steady voice it was red oriley he had
staggered to his feet his battered bruised
face still bleeding but his eyes were rag-
ing at the russian the redhead bel-
lowed by heaven this lad whipped me
fairly and its me thats with him

  bardoff yelled furiously to the motley
mob do you allow them to do this
why shouldnt we take the woman from
them

  yes lets take her howled a score
of brutal voices

  david russell swaying hardly able to
stand saw von hausman and husper
and the bruised oriley bunch together
and raise their fists and ruue spears

  the ragged mob surged toward them
with bardoff in the lead christa hid her
face on davids shoulder then suddenly
a strange an awful thing happened

  bardoff the russian suddenly stopped
short his whole body stiffening as
though turned to stone then slowiy
mechanically he turned and began to
walk away with strange stiff strides-to
walk toward the frowning black cliffs
and as he walked he shrieked wildly to
the suddenly transfixed mob the mas-
ter his will is on me-he is calling me

  the mob shrank back in dread david
saw that the russians face was now that
of a soul in hell as he marched stiffly on
like a human automaton toward the cliffs

  gott breathed von hausman


weird tales

white-faced another of us called by
the master

  save me the receding russian was
screaming wildly save me from the
master

  not one person made a move toward
him all shrank back in horrified dread
toward the shelter of the huts the rus-
sian strode stiffly on and now had
started up a steep path that climbed the
cliff toward the brooding castle

  david staring with christa terrifiedly
clinging to him and with the german
and husper and oriley the only others
now left in the clearing saw the doomed
man climbing straight toward the front
of the monstrous black castle he saw a
door appear in the blank black front of
the building the russian strode stiffly
through his last wild despairing cry float-
ing faintly down to them then the aper-
ture closed after him

  through the three men beside david
and christa went a sigh of horror von
hausmans keen eyes were haunted as he
told david you see now why we all
dread the master so we never know at
what moment he will call us nor what
dark unholy doom he deals out to those
whom he summons into the castle

  but why did the man go up there
when he didnt want to david pro-
tested he was terrified yet he walked
straight on

  halfdon husper told him solemnly
the will of the master was on him and
he could not resist-no human can re-
sist when that call comes

  a said the german darkly what-
ever thing it is that lairs up in that un-
holy place it can throw its will on any
of us call us to it whenever it wishes
it is so we shall all end in time if we
do not die first

  not christa and i david declared
passionately im going to get her away
from this hellish island somehow

  red orileys bruised face grinned ap-
proval

  im with you there lad he declared
ten years ive been on this devils place
ever since my schooner that was loaded
with guns for abd-el-krim piled up
here in the night ive seen a plenty of
men called up there by the old satan that
lives in that castle and im damned if
ill sit around here longer twiddling my
thumbs waitin for him to call me ill
risk anything to get away

  von hausman shrugged hopelessly
it is useless to talk of it-you know
what happens to anyone who tries to
escape from the island however we can
discuss that later these two must have a
place to live so halfdon and i will give
them our hut

he led the way along the street of
wretched huts it was growing
dusky now there was no sun or sunset
visible in the flickering sky but that sky
steadily was darkening into a thick
strange twilight the great forest loomed
in deep shade now gloomy and forbid-
ding up on the cliff above the valley
the black stronghold of the dreaded
master bulked ominously against the
dusking sky

  von hausman led them into a small
bark cabin it was unfurnished save for
beds of boughs and a pile of strange-
looldng fruit in one corner they sat
down together in the dusky interior and
ate the fruit david found it tasted as
queer as it looked christa nestled nerv-
ously at his side silent still over-
whelmed

  david could hardly yet believe in the
reality of this strange place this island
invisible to the outer world peopled by
survivors of a hundred past wrecks
ruled by the mysterious unseen occupant
of the black castle yet von hausman
and husper and oriley ate with quiet
child of atlantis

matter-of-factness the redheaded gun-
runner had apparently forgotten all ani-
mosity against david

  when he had finished oriley tossed
the fruit-husks outside and stretched
back groaning what i wouldnt give
now for a pipe and something to put in
it i swear if i ever get away from here
ill smoke for six months without stop-
ping even to sleep

  david asked the german why do
you say its impossible to escape from
the island it seems to me that it
shouldnt be hard to make some sort of
raft or dugout canoe and launch it
once away from the island out where
you could be seen by passing ships youd
have a good chance of being picked up
von hausman laughed mirthlessly
a good many men on this island have
thought that and have tried to get away
in rafts or rude boats and sooner or
later in each case before they could
start the master called them whatever
it is that dwells up in the castle it does
not want anyone to escape from this
island-no

  that is so rumbled the great nor-
wegian and that is why we no longer
try to escape it is hard to live here as
we do-but it is more terrible to feel the
will of the master on you to answer his
call and go up into his castle never to
return

  christa peering out through the door-
way with wide eyes at the enigmatic
black structure looming in the dusky
sky clung to her husband in shivering
dread david im afraid

  he soothed her yet felt as though a
cold alien wind of dread had blown
over him too he asked but who or
what is the master you say you dont
know-but you must have some idea
von hausman said thoughtfully we
ido not know because those who see the
master up there never come out again

but one thing i am sure of-the master
is immortal

  and as david and christa stared at
him incredulously the u-boat officer con-
tinued i believe that this island has
existed here invisible and unsuspected
by the world for countless centuries for
along its shores i have found old rotted
wreckage and metal objects from ships of
many centuries back from eighteenth
century frigates and sixteenth century
slavers and spanish caravels like those
of columbus-even wreckage of a greek
galley that must have ventured into these
western seas more than two thousand
years ago

  von hausman added that shows
the island has been here invisible for
centuries now the only thing that can
keep this island invisible to the outside
world is some force or power exerted by
the master therefore the master must
have dwelt here during all those cen-
turies

  david made an impatient gesture
after all i dont care who or what the
master is what i want to do is to get
christa away from this unholy place im
going to do that somehow master or no
master

  and its me that seconds the motion
promptly declared oriley what the
devil-this isnt any place for a man of
action like meself to be moldering away
his life well build ourselves a boat and
launch it and the back of our hands to
the master if he tries to stop us

  we wouldnt need to build a boat
david said eagerly my yawl-it was
tossed up onto the outer rocks down at
the shore i think the hull is stove in a
little and the masts are snapped but
there are tools in it and we could patch it
up enough to be seaworthy in a few
days he added passionately isnt it
better to try it than to sit here and do
nothing it may be true that before we


weird tales

can escape in it the master will call us
as he has done the others who tried to
eescape but if we just sit here it seems
that sooner or later well be called to the
same fate anyway so why not try to get
away

  sure and why not echoed oriley
weve got nothin to lose but our lives
half don husper said slowly i say
try it then i have a wife in oslo if she
still lives and i am weary of waiting for
death here

  they all looked at von hausman
after a moment the german said quiet-
ly i have been here longer than any of
you i am quite certain that this attempt
to escape will mean death for all of us
and not quick easy death but some hor-
rible fate at the masters hands it is
sure that before we can ever launch that
boat we shall be called up there to that
fate his keen eyes smiled yet i
also say let us try it i too am weary of
waiting idly for death here

  then we four will go down and start
work on the yawl in the morning david
declared he added troubledly to his
young wife christa youre going to stay
here while we work no one here will
bother you now and if you do not go
with us there is less chance of the mas-
ters doom falling on you if it does fall
i want to be with you david she
cried but after a little at davids
anxiety she gave in and consented to re-
main in the hut while they worked

night passed quickly a strange star-
less and moonless night with only
the unceasing flickering visible in the
dark sky and when dawn came it was a
gray sunless dawn a slow gradual in-
crease in light leaving christa in the
hut the four made their way quietly out
of the village and through the forest to
the beach

  the yawl still lay on the rocks where

it had been tossed david fished axes
saws and other tools from its hold and
they began the work half don husper
most experienced of them took charge as
they rudely patched the holes in the hull

  ever and again through the day david
glanced tensely over his shoulder at the
distant cliffs and castle

  von hausman noticed that and said
quietly do not fear mein freund the
master is watching us that is sure
let him watch rasped david des-
perately well get away-we will
but when they returned into the vil-
lage that evening they saw that the rag-
ged motley mob there now looked at
them with awe and dread these others
had discovered during the day that they
were working on the yawl

  they already look on us as doomed
by the master as dead men commented
the german

  oriley bristled anyone who tries
anything on me will find out that its a
damned tough dead man i am he de-
clared and that goes for the old devil
up in the castle too

  christa cried softly in davids arms
that night david i feel that something
terrible is going to happen to you and
if it did i wouldnt want to live
nothings going to happen to me
he insisted despite the fatal foreboding
in his heart well get away

  by the end of the next day the four
men had completely if crudely patched
the holes in the yawls hull they got it
afloat secured it by cables to the rocks
half don husper regarded their work
with satisfaction

  tomorrow we will cut and fit new
spars the norwegian said then-

day was beginning to fade eerily as
they returned to the village it
looked stricken deserted-no one was
abroad in it but from the doors oi thd
child of atlantis



huts horrified faces stared silently at
them christa was not in the bark cabin
nor did she answer davids calls
somethings happened to her he

cried some of these brutes-

  gripping the ax he had brought back
from the yawl he ran wildly down the
rude street he plucked a man out of the
door of one of the huts a loutish breton
sailor who stared at him with ignorant
horror-widened eyes

  whats happened to my wife
snarled david raising the ax menacingly
if some of you have harmed her ill
kill you

  the breton gasping in davids furi-
ous choking grip stammered an answer
it was not us-the girl is gone for
ever an hour ago the call of the mas-
ter came upon her and she climbed the
cliff and passed up into the castle she did
not want to go-she screamed as all they
who feel the call scream but she could
not help herself

  david felt the blood leave his heart as
the ghastly truth penetrated his mind
he saw infinite pity on the faces of his
three friends and heard von hausman
whisper gott the master has sum-
moned her we shall never see her
again

  i will see her again raved david
wildly im going up there and try to
get her out if i have to go alone

  he suddenly turned on the ragged
motley men staring from the huts and
lashed them with raging words of vol-
canic fury you men-are you really
men or are you sheep that you sit here
and let whatever creature is up in that
castle kill you at his will whoever the
master is he must be living and that
means that he can be killed why dont
you try to kill him instead of submitting
humbly to his will why dont you storm
the castle and destroy him instead of

waiting for him to destroy you one by
one

  a fierce yell burst from the men before
him hard-bitten brutal men from all the
seven seas whose smoldering hate and
fear of the master had been fanned to a
quick blaze by davids raging words

  a flashing-eyed italian sailor waved
his spear aloft and cried by the saints
he speaks truth why do we not pull
down the demon that crouches up there

  thats the stuif lads cried red o-
riley exultantly

  aye death to the master boomed
halfdon huspers great voice the huge
norwegians eyes flaming with long-re-
pressed hatred

  death to the master burst a raging
chorus of two hundred voices as rude
spears and swords waved thick from the
maddened men

  david his face half crazed with rage
shook his heavy ax and cried up the
cliff then well storm the masters
castle before he can claim my wife as an-
other victim

they poured out of the village a
roaring raging mob of savage sea-
men from every nation every man with
his weapon every man afire to destroy
the mysterious being whom they had
dreaded so long

  david ran at their head his face white
and set his ax gripped in his hand with
the exulting oriley and the blazing-eyed
norwegian and von hausman curiously
calm behind him close after the four
streamed the wild mob david led them
straight to the cliff and up the steep
narrow path in single file he knew that
if they had time to recover from their
rage the old dread of the master would
rapidly repossess them

  above them bulked ominously against
the dusky sky the mysterious black castle
it seemed to david that as they neared


weird tales

the top of the cliff the raging roar of his
mob of followers lessened a little their
pace slackened

  oriley yelled back to them on
comrades in a minute well be inside
the masters castle

  death to the master thundered
back the wild climbing horde

  now david and the three friends
close at his heels climbed onto the sheer
rock shelf in front of the castle the
huge square structure loomed black and
somber before them doorless and win-
dowless

  theres a door somewhere in front
here david cried well find it

  he led them at a run toward the
towering black wall of smooth stone that
was the front of the citadel

  suddenly he stopped short and at the
same moment every man behind halted
in his tracks he could not go forward
he wanted to for every fiber in his body
was aflame with raging desire to rush
forward and break into this structure
into which christa had gone but he
could not take a single step forward it
was as though his legs had suddenly
ceased to obey his brains commands and
were under outside control

  the men behind him smitten to a halt
by the same weird phenomenon were
struck silent with stupefaction for a mo-
ment then a cry of horror and dread
went up from the ragged mob

  the masters will is on us

  god save us-the master has us in
his grip

  david fought to move forward mak-
ing a tremendous effort of his will to
move his legs even one step sweat stood
out on his forehead but he could not
move

  he heard a confused cry of terror from
the mob behind him then he saw that
the ragged horde and also von hausman
and husper and oriley had begun to

move back down the cliff walking with
stiff mechanical strides down the path

  oriley halfdon come back
yelled david hoarsely we can still
break in and destroy that demon inside
the big irishman his face white and
beaded with sweat called thickly back
lad we cant

  and von hausman as they marched
stiffly away down the path cried back up
to david the master-his will is mak-
ing us return to the village

   stiffly striding shouting in their terror
now davids ragged followers descended
the path up which they had raged a few
moments before and stiffly his three
friends followed despite their struggles
david was left standing alone in the
flickering dusk before the enormous
citadel

  suddenly his legs began to move under
him stiffly as those of a dead man they
stalked forward with him toward the
front of the great building he could not
control that movement-it was another
brain that was directing his forward
strides but he did not try to fight it now
for in his throbbing brain was only the
desire to get into the castle where
christa was still gripping his ax tightly
in his hand he strode forward with those
mechanical steps

  as he neared the blank black wall of
the citadel a tiny round aperture ap-
peared in it the aperture expanded
rapidly like an opening camera shutter
into a round door beyond which he saw a
great hall filled with misty blue light
david strode on into that blue-lit hall
and heard the door close with a sighing
sound after him

  tramp tramp-the steady strides
which he did not himself will took him
across the great hall he saw through the
light-mists massive shining mechanisms
of unearthly design standing about him

                    w t-
child of atlantis



he passed on through them into a huge
vaulted corridor

  davids legs took him on down that
corridor somewhere in this building the
master was drawing david to him con-
trolling his body by super-hypnotic
force he passed other halls and corri-
dors all flooded with pale misty blue
luminescence holding weird instruments
and mechanisms of unfathomable pur-
pose then he emerged into a colossal
domed central hall

  he stared with fascinated stupefied
eyes as he was drawn forward at the
center of this mighty chamber poised a
ten-foot crystal sphere inside which
pulsed a throbbing core of living azure
fire like a miniature misty blue sun

  in front of this titan crystal of pulsing
light was a thronc-like metal chair he
could just glimpse through a shroud of
concealing light-mists and he glimpsed
or sensed someone something sitting
upon that metal throne facing the
throne stood-

  christa cried david hoarsely

  the girl stood a wild terror frozen
upon her face her slim childish body
silhouetted against the blue light

  she turned at davids cry tried to run
toward him but could not move rooted
by the same force that was drawing him
stiffly forward anguish had leaped into
her eyes at sight of him

  david she uttered in a sobbing
cry you came after me-came to your
doom-

  he was beside her now and there
without command of his own brain his
stiff strides suddenly stopped he tried
to step to christa and take her in his
arms but could not he could only
reach out with one hand and touch her
trembling cheek

  she stared ahead once more horror
unveiled in her eyes david turned his
head and looked forward to what she
w t-

stared at that metal throne whose base
could just be glimpsed through the curl-
ing blue light-mists that surrounded it

david gripped his ax tighter yet he
felt utterly helpless powerless
standing with the girl before that shroud-
ed throne and before the colossal crystal
of throbbing light

  out of the light-mists around the
throne spoke the voice of the master a
metallic voice of chill measured accents

  man from outside you interest me
the passionless cold voice of the master
told david you tried to do what no
other here ever tried to do attack me in
revolt i am sorry now i did not call
you here sooner-i meant in any case to
call you and your friends because of your
childish attempt to escape the island
david tried to keep his voice steady
you can do what you want with me
he told the master i know that but i
will submit willingly gladly if you will
allow the girl to go

  no david cried christa i share
your fate if you die i die

  the masters metallic voice told them
your argument is purposeless my will
rules here and not yours-it rules even
your own bodies as you have learned
my actions are not to be disturbed by
your tiny clamor it is my intention to
use the body of this girl at once as ma-
terial for certain interesting experiments
which i have long been performing on
humans whom i called from the village
as for you man who dared attack me
you will have the same fate a little
later

  youre not going to use christas
body for your experiments said david
in a thick hoarse voice youre not
he was slowly stealthily raising the
heavy ax if he could throw it if he could
hurl it into the shrouding mists at the
thing on the metal throne-
i

weird tales

  his hand flashed up for the wild cast
-and froze in midair gripping the ax
he could not throw the weapon

  the veins on davids neck corded
with tremendous effort but his arm and
shoulder muscles would not obey his
will

  you fool scorncd the cold acccnts
of the master did you not think that i
could read your intention in your mind
that i could hold your arms powerless by
my will as easily as your legs do you
think me a stupid blundering creature
of flesh and blood like yourself look
human and see

  the light-mists drifted swiftly away
from the seat of the master as he spoke
there on the metal throne before the
great crystal of throbbing light he sat
unveiled

  david felt his brain reeling as he
stared he heard a choking of horror
from christa

  the master was a metal robot-a me-
chanical creature of coppery metal
formed like a horrible travesty of human-
ity with metal arms legs and cylindrical
body and a bulbous metal head or brain-
case out of which two glittering unwink-
ing eye lenses watched them

  god a robot cried david a ma-
chine created by somebody-

  and a machine greater far than its
creators came the cold voice of the
master

  there was a strange note of pride in
the robots chill accents it was as though
it was speaking out of that resonator
mouth below its eyes not to the trans-
fixed david and christa but to itself

  yes they were men like you who
created me he was saying though men
wiser far than you in the craft and skill
of science long long ago that was long
ago in ancient atlantis whose fertile con-
tinent stood here in the sea where now
only this little island stands and where

the races of men had readied their high-
est civilization

  the scientists of atlantis had built
many wonderful mechanisms some of
them completely automatic and self-sus-
taining in operation and they dreamed
finally of creating a machine with brain
and mind

  i was that machine there in atlantis
ages past i was born in the laboratories
of the greatest scientists my body was
easy to build but for decades they
worked on the metal brain they meant to
give me

  that brain when they finished it was
incomparably more complex in its metal
neurone structure than is the human
brain because of that it could receive
and classify an incomparably greater
number of thought-patterns that meant
that i had the capacity for infinitely great-
er knowledge and memory than any hu-
man

  the scientists instructed me proud of
my progress but very soon i had learned
all that they could teach me and as i
passed beyond them in knowledge and
power they began to realize that they had
created a being greater than themselves

  there was a brooding note of undying
hate in the metallic voice of the robot

  i became great in power in atlantis
the final oracle in all problems to the
populace i was a god and as such i was
worshipped and had my temple power
i loved not for its own sake but only
because it enabled me to continue my
quest for new knowledge

  then the atlantean scientists who
had created me regretted their work and
wished to destroy me they aroused the
populace against me and attacked my
temple with the most powerful weapons
they could muster i repelled them but
they attacked me again at last i grew
weary of their harrying and i resolved
to destroy all atlantis and its people ex-
child of atlantis



cept for the land on which my temple
stood

  in a single night i did the thing for
long i had gathered my powers and on
that night i unchained them and they
smote down into the earths structure far
beneath the continent of atlantis and
touched off great earth-faults that i knew
existed there in the depths and in that
one night all the continent of atlantis
and all its people sank downward and the
sea crashed over the land and hid it for
ever

  all but one small portion of the con-
tinent the portion around my temple
that did not sink for i had provided
against that setting up certain radiated
forces which sustain that small bit of
land as an island above the waves that
great crystal of blue fire which you see
behind me man from outside is the
source of the radiation which still up-
holds the island were it not for that
crystals radiation the slender pinnacle
of rock which bears up this island must
have collapsed long ago

  also there is a force mingled in the
crystals radiation which refracts light
around the island keeping it invisible to
the outside world so that i will not be
annoyed by the curiosity of the barbarian
races of men occasionally ships have
crashed onto my invisible island as yours
did and men have gained its shore i
have suffered them to live down there in
their wretched village because i some-
times need their bodies for my research-
es

the glittering lens-eyes of the mas-
ter seemed to muse upon the strick-
en christa and upon david still standing
petrified with his ax upraised

  man from outside why do i speak of
these things to you who can little under-
stand them asked the robot it is for

only one reason-it is because i am
lonely

  yes i the child of old atlantis long
more and more for contact with a mind
equal to my own i have resolved to
create one a metal brain as intelligent
as mine that is the purpose that en-
gages me and it is upon issues connect-
ed with that purpose that i am experi-
menting upon the bodies of humans like
you and this girl

  not upon christas body - no
shouted david hoarsely

  do you think to frighten me by
mouthing futile threats asked the ro-
bot calmly man from outside you
humans begin to weary me i think it is
well that the girl go now to the labora-
tories where you will follow in due
course

  christa uttered a heart-torn cry
david good-bye-

  no youre not going there david
cried he was making tremendous men-
tal effort to free his arm from the hyp-
notic grip of the master to hurl his ax
but the masters super-hypnotism held
him powerless

  across davids brain seared a lightning
expedient a thought that he suppressed
as soon as he was aware of it he des-
perately began to think to think a lie

  he began to think of stirrings in the
dim ocean depths below where wrecked
atlantis lay entombed of mighty scien-
tists emerging from tight chambers where
they had lain sleeping and not dead he
thought of them vowing vengeance upon
the robot they had created of assembling
great weapons of sending him david
russell ahead as a spy upon the robot

  the master read the lie in davids
mind and for a moment was deceived by
it for the robot leaped wildly upright

  then they of atlantis are not all
dead cried the metallic voice they
come again against me-


weird tales

  for that single moment of wild excite-
ment the masters mind relaxed its re-
morseless hypnotic grip upon david and
christa

  that one instant was enough in it
davids muscles exploded in mad action
and sent the ax in his hand flying straight
toward the robots head

  the heavy ax-head crashed squarely
into the bulbous metal brain-case be-
tween the lens-like eyes the steel blade
drove deep through the outer casing into
the interior of the head deep into the
metal brain that had been created ages
ago in the laboratories of dead atlantis

  the master staggered his metallic
voice uttered an awful broken scream

  tricked tricked by a barbarian crea-
ture of flesh but i will destroy you
all-

  even as he uttered that dying scream
the master was whirling was falling
but he fell with outstretched metal arms
crashing purposefully down against the
giant crystal of blue fire behind him the
crystal whose radiated force alone held
the island from sinking beneath the
waves

  the crystal shivered beneath the crack-
ing impact of the dead robots falling
body the blue fire inside it dulled and
died instantly david heard christa cry
out run into his arms

  then they were thrown from their feet
by a terrific earth shock they heard a
thunderous roar from the earth beneath
the castle and the crash of the castles
black walls as they were riven by the aw-
ful shock

david grabbed his wife and plunged
desperately across the huge halls and
corridors whose walls were collapsing and
crashing around him he glimpsed day-
light through a great gap in the outer
wall and he leaped with christa through

the gap out into the day they stopped
on the shelf of the cliff for a moment
appalled

  the whole island was heaving and
rocking like a ship on a stormy sea the
thunderous earth-shocks were following
each other at intervals of seconds and
there was a long grinding roar from deep
beneath that told of shifting settling
masses the sun had appeared in the sky
since the light-refracting force had died
but the heavens were instantly overcast
with an ominous crimson pall

  the two fled down the path into the
valley david feeling nausea from the roll
and buck of the earth beneath him in
the valley the huts were in ruins and
their ragged occupants were running
about in mad panic von hausman and
oriley and the great norwegian came
running wildly up to david and the girl
gott in hinmel yelled the german
what is-

  the island is sinking into the sea
screamed david over the roaring crashes
i killed the master and in dying he
acted to make the island sink our only
chance is to get to the yawl

  to the yawl then shouted husper
his face crimson with excitement

  they sprinted forward into the forest
the earth still rolling and heaving wildly
under their feet

   saints in heaven look cried oriley
glancing back horrified

  with terrible reverberating roll of
thunder the cliff and ruined castle of the
master were collapsing in masses of rock
onto the valley they had just quitted

  on yelled von hausman

  fissures opened on either side of them
as they plunged through the wild-waving
woods terrific tremors crashed down
trees and twice knocked them from their
feet

  they burst out onto the beach the sea
child of atlantis



before them was wild great waves rush-
ing madly in to shore and then out again
threatening to tear from its cables the
mastless yawl that bobbed crazily on the
waters

  they waded out through the rising
waters  smashed by inrushing waves
shaken by the shifting of the rocks be-
neath their feet and finally clambered
onto the pitching yawl

  cut loose shouted halfdon husper

  davids ax sliced the cables the yawl
whirled crazily like a cork then was
sucked far far back out to sea by the
waters now receding at mill-race speed
from the island-out and out until the
waters halted for a moment in awful
dead calm and from that distance they
glimpsed the whole island with solemn
grinding drum-roll from far beneath
sinking down into the waters

  the last black mass of the island
plunged down under the sea then the
waters around the yawl boiled terrifically
and raced wildly with the little boat to-
ward the spot where the island had been
a mad maelstrom of converging currents

  halfdon husper thrust the others by
main force down into the cabin of the
yawl leaped in after them and slammed
the hatchway shut next moment they
were tossed violently against the walls of
the dark cabin as the yawl seemed to
stand up on its stern david still hold-
ing christa tightly felt his head strike
the cabin wall and knew nothing more

when he awoke brilliant sunset
light was in his eyes he was lying
on the deck of the yawl and christa and
his friends were bending anxiously over
him husper had a great bruise on his
face but the others did not seem injured

  david struggled to sit up his dazed
eyes sweeping the waters the sea was
still heaving and troubled but the terrific
currents had vanished there was no sign
of the island or of any other land any-
where in the tossing blue waste

  david stammered the yawl - it
wasnt sucked down by the currents
then

  von hausman his quiet face still pale
said no but it must have been only a
reverse under-current that snatched us
back out of the maelstrom the yawl was
actually under water when that current
gripped us

  oriley drawing a long breath nod-
ded his flaming head in corroboration
its me that was saying my prayers that
minute

  christa was crying eagerly david
weve sighted the smoke of a ship coming
-were going to be picked up

  his arm encircled her tightly but for
the moment his eyes were not looking at
her but gazing fascinatedly at the heav-
ing waters into whose green depths the
lifeless metal form and shattered castle
of the master had sunk for ever the
child of old atlantis he had gone down
at last to rejoin his creators in death

v oyage or the
neutralia

by b wallis

an exciting story of weird adventures and a strange voyage through space to
other planets-by the author of the abysmal horror
and other fascinating thrill-tales

the story thus far

 a ylmer carscadden eminent
 american scientist discovers and
manufactures metal impervious
to gravitation and also under intense
cold repelled by other substances he is
financed by hugh burgoyne they con-
struct a large shell christened neutralia
with which to explore beyond our plan-
ets atmosphere the two with jacob
flint an old employee set out for our
satellite after starting two former em-
ployees kobloth and whipps discharged
for spying are found stowaways in the
storeroom

  after some experiments in arresting
the stupendous speed of the shell they
arrive safely at the moon finding an at-
mosphere though rarefied capable of
supporting life they alight in the great
crater of copernicus moss and giant
cacti are the sole vegetation but gold
and diamonds are found in large de-
posits

  while the scientist is inspecting these
kobloth and whipps suddenly attack
carscadden and flint stunning them with
rocks the treacherous pair instantly dash
for the shell hoping to make off with it
and later return to exploit the vast wealth
they have seen burgoyne however ar-
rives on the scene and at point of his gun
compels them to surrender

  carscadden and flint recovering all
return and the prisoners are locked in
the storeroom then the shell is headed
for mars traveling at a million miles
an hour they arrive and alight they find
the surface is covered with a network of
great cables a curious carriage comes
racing along a cable and its occupant im-
mediately attacks them with electrified
wires other carriages arrive and join in
the attack

  the story continues

startled by its strangeness the voy-
agers halted involuntarily and in-
stantly saw that along all the cables con-
verging toward the spot beneath which
lay the neutralia hundreds of the spider-
martians were racing the air was rent
with their weird shrill cries and
throbbed with the drone of their power-
ful propelling mechanisms in a few sec-
onds the nearest would be directly above
them

  quick into the globe snapped car-
scadden give me a lift up and ill
throw out another ladder i can find one
at once see that kobloth and whipps
are the last to ascend quick here come
their wires

  instantly burgoyne had the scientist
on his shoulders and the globe being a
little tilted toward them carscadden eas-



this story began in weird tales for november
the voyage of the neutralia



ily swung himself into it a second more
and a rope ladder had fallen beside the
big sentinel who revolver in hand held
off the two scoundrels who had tried to
seize it

  stand back you two go last-or stay
as dead men he shouted angrily up
you go flint he ordered in the same
breath

  at once flint scrambled up the sway-
ing steps and burgoyne still threatening
the desperate pair of ruffians with his
leveled revolver was on the point of
following his example when from above
came a cry

  look out hugh jump for it

  but he was too late for a bright thin
wire had dropped from aloft caught in
the ladders middle and instantly had
dragged it away from the globe with
burgoyne hanging by one hand to its last
step

  jump for the door hugh quick
shouted carscadden desperately

  sure muttered burgoyne to himself
but its a cent to a million dollars i miss
it and as the end of the ladder dan-
gling from the rapidly updrawn wire came
abreast of the door he twisted around
with a supreme effort and made a flying

weird tales

leap for the open door where with out-
stretched hands the two already there
awaited to snatch at him he only just
managed to clutch the outer flange of the
doorway but in a breath the two had
hauled him to safety looking back he
saw what he had so narrowly escaped a
score of gleaming wires were uncoiling
and falling toward the globe

  what are we to do about the two
down there we cant leave them to that
sort of death got any more rope ayl-
mer cried burgoyne staring at the two
wretches below who crouching close to
the in-curving wall of the globe were
trying to evade a perfect rain of wires
which were descending upon it

  help for gods sake help they
screamed in a frenzy of terror and there
was very good reason for even such fears
as theirs for already not far off kob-
loth had seen several of the bat-like crea-
tures captured and drawn up by the
wires and heard their shrieks of agony
abruptly silenced as their captors pre-
sumably devoured them immediately
the ladder of course had been ripped
away and aloft as though it were no
more than pack-thread

  look out for the rope warned bur-
goyne flinging an end of the line car-
scadden had snatched from a handy cleat
by the doorway only one of you at a
time-it wont bear more than that

  both men clutched the rope together
and clung to it fiercely

  let go one of you shouted the sci-
entist angrily the clawed and hooked
wires were hovering near them and fran-
tic with terror neither of the unfortunate
men would relinquish his grip

  let go one must die-or both
shouted burgoyne as a wire with a fiery
red star at the end of it wras cast by a
martian toward them the crack of a re-
volver rang out behind him carscadden
had fired at the car above the shot took

  effect apparently for the fiery red star
at once fell harmlessly to the red sand

  with a frenzied strength the austrian
snatched his companions grip from the
rope and shouted haul up he shall
die first and as he shouted he sprang
with astounding agility high up and
caught the line far up its length but
whipps too made a desperate leap-a
leap to evade a fiery star that swung to-
ward him

   he was too late the point of light fell
on his shoulder with a wild cry of
agony he fell back on the sand his face
and body contorted horribly as one elec-
trocuted in a flash a clawing wire had
seized him and his rigid body was hauled
aloft into the network of cables in a
moment kobloth was dragged inside the
globe and the fear in his eyes was un-
forgettable

burgoyne had his hand on the door
immediately when the scientist
stopped him

  no not yet we must keep it open
for a little he wrarned him we have
nearly exhausted our compressed air
tanks and must replenish them before
the door is closed i have already set the
electric pumps going-it will not take
more than an hour at the outside but we
dare not make a start with nearly empty
tanks moreover we must try and hold
on until daylight

  why asked his friend in surprize

  because before daylight we should be
leaving mars on the side opposite to the
earth and going still farther away from
our planet

  well we have our guns and plenty
of shells and may be able to stand the
brutes off but i dont fancy those fiery
stars is it possible they could electro-
cute us through the steel walls he asked
gravely

  no i dont think so just now we
the voyage of the neutralia



have the neutralium shell above us and
the outer steel wall is insulated from the
inner lining you remember i thought it
advisable in case of electrical disturb-
ances we might encounter of course
what other offensive resources they have
at their command we cannot tell we
can only keep our eyes open and if we
have to start well we must chance it
declared carscadden philosophically as
for the clawed wires i have something
here that will fix them if they menace
us he added quietly as he stepped to a
near-by chest and extracted from it a
couple of short-handled and very large-
headed instruments these things are
carbons insulated from the handles
when we switch on all the current at
our command the heat of the electric
arc between them will be quite consid-
erable i think it will melt their wires
without much difficulty

  fine heres your chance to experi-
ment-a couple of the infernal things
sticking to us just outside the doorway
cried burgoyne as pleased as a boy at the
possibility of a really effective offensive

  right here get the wire between
the carbon points and ill switch on the
juice cried the scientist handing him an
instrument

  a moment and burgoyne raised a
hand in signal the switch was moved
a flash of vivid light leapt between the
points and instantly the wire was fused
and fell apart at once the second wire
was so treated with a like result at this
an excited shrill whistling broke out
among the martians in their cars above

  thats got them guessing cried bur-
goyne jubilantly reckon they thought
no one knew anything about electricity
but themselves

  likely but im afraid theyve got
other things up their sleeves to try out on
us yet however in another thirty min-
utes we can close the door and leave

them but we must fight for that thirty
minutes kobloth had better have his
gun back we cant worry about trifles in
such a tight corner said their captain
coolly

  thank you mr carscadden ill do
my best im quite a fair shot replied
the austrian gratefully

  better get busy advised old flint
those uglies are trying to throw a net
all over us

  true enough a perfect maze of
clawed disk-ended and star-tailed wires
was enmeshing the great globe many
fell on the neutralium cover and failed
to grip it but numerous others attached
themselves to the uncovered steel half
the four men at once commenced to rain
bullets amid their foes and the cries of
rage and pain that answered the volleys
told of the damage being wrought
shortly half a dozen cars and their wreird
occupants had crashed to the sand and
many of the wires lay broken and tan-
gled all that came near the door were
fused instantly by the carbons and for a
little it seemed as if the battle favored
the voyagers but at the globes side
away from the door many disks attached
themselves and could not be come at by
the defenders and these began to draw
the neutralia along at a good pace the
strength of the wires and their grip must
have been enormous for the globe
plowed a deep rut through the sand as
though steam winches and giant cables
had hold of it luckily the door faced
the canal so that they were drawn away
from it

  another ten minutes said the sci-
entist anxiously then night or no
night we must go

  with redoubled fury the revolvers
spat their deadly missiles among the be-
siegers and car after car came crashing
from the high cables the execution
caused even these fearless monsters to


weird tales

halt their proceedings suddenly the
globes movement stopped the wires
were drawn rapidly upward and the
ranks of the enemy parted and left a
clear right of way between them a reso-
nant clang like the sound of a huge
gong came from the western cliff and
a bright object flashing along a cable at
terrific speed rushed between the two
groups of now silent martians and came
to a stop directly over the neutrdia

  what now cried burgoyne what
devils game is this

  even as he spoke from this new arri-
val there was let down by thick wires a
large cylindrical object swaying to and
fro as though being carefully adjusted
it finally came to rest exactly opposite
and a few feet from the globes open
door a speck of bluish flame glowed
in the center of its only visible end

  look out close the door screamed
the austrian that looks like a bomb
with its fuse lit

the scientist being nearest reached
the closing-lever before his compan-
ions but even while throwing his weight
on it his scientific instincts compelled
him to peer forward to obtain one
glimpse of this unknown offensive that
little part of a seconds delay was his un-
doing

  before the steel rod slid home there
came a burst of vivid flame from the
pointing cylinder which seemed to
shrivel up and vanish as a vast cloud of
coal-black vapor poured from it a
dense stinking poisonous fog rushed
through the narrowing slit left by the
closing door and carscadden was for an
instant immersed in its strangling folds
as the door thudded softly home he
fell to the floor gasping and insensible

  burgoyne who was nearest him reeled
a step away coughing and choking but

by a strong effort of will recovered suf-
ficiently to drag the scientist farther back
in the chamber kobloth and flint too
got a taste of the malignant stuff as it
wafted about but were not seriously af-
fected

  whats to be done cried burgoyne
carscadden i think will soon recover-
he is breathing quite normally again but
heaven knows we should get out of this
instantly and only carscadden knows
anything about this aerial navigation

  yes we must not delay a minute i
understand the registers-we must chance
our direction you can work the wheel
and flint attend to the captain replied
kobloth his technical and scientific train-
ing aiding his natural resolute hardihood

  at that moment a terrific crash as of
some heavy body falling on the cover
above filled the globe with a deafening
clamor

  that settles it shouted burgoyne
we chance it are you ready kob-
loth

  go ahead cried the austrian al-
ready at the registers himmel over
with the cover he ordered impatiently

  the great neutralium cover turned
the swinging platform rocked violently
and the fog-obscured windows of the
lower half were hidden while the un-
covered upper lights exposed a cloudy
sky barred by a network of gigantic
cables along which hundreds of the mar-
tians moving were visible a pause as
the cover pushed its way through the
sand beneath the globe a shock as the
globe rocked then righted itself then
mars was sinking rapidly away from
them up through the cables tearing
a great gap in the network as though it
were mosquito veiling soared the neu-
trala passing with a roar and a thrill of
heat through the martian atmosphere
and so out into the cold and soundless
the voyage of the neutralia



night of space it shot away from mars
away from the sun and awray from our
planet

	ten million miles an hour

iiwtell ats settled observed

  w burgoyne philosophically as he
locked the wheel we are out in space
sure enough but where bound for i
havent the slightest notion still any-
thing is better than that devilish world
we have left behind us

  at present we are receding from
mars at more than fifty thousand miles
an hour and gaining pace every mo-
ment said the austrian consulting the
registers the cold of space is acting
as a tonic to the neutralia where we
are heading for i cannot say some of
these instruments not to mention astro-
nomical navigation require an experts
handling we can only hope that mr
carscadden will soon recover and be able
to take charge again he added fervently

  since the awful fate of his companion
the austrian had seemed a changed man
possibly he realized that he had taken his
life in his hands in the pursuit of his evil
and vindictive purposes and that now he
stood alone one man among three who
had every reason to regard him with
aversion and distrust he realized too
probably far more deeply than burgoyne
and flint the hopeless nature of their
plight if their captains stupor did not
shortly leave him the fate of all de-
pended absolutely on the brain of the
man who alone of all mankind had made
the probing of space possible

  each of the three men kobloth as
earnestly solicitous as the others did his
best for the unconscious man but it
seemed as though all their efforts would
be unavailing his whole system must
have been saturated with the poisonous
draft he had quaffed hours passed and

still he remained unconscious living
breathing but otherwise inert as a log
meanwhile the neutralia sped silently on
through trackless space speeding out of
the profound abyss where the greater
planets swing in their vast and solitary
orbits already the pointers recording in
tens of thousands on the speed registers
seemed but faint blurs of shadow on their
dials already the globe was clear of the
long conical shadow cast by mars and
the sun was but a small and fiery disk
that shone steadily to the eastward in a
jet-black sky while the earth was now a
mere speck of dim light hardly discern-
ible

  forty-eight hours went by in this man-
ner watching the changeless sky the
humming registers and attending to the
unconscious man forty-eight hours of
the most intense anxiety little wonder
they slept but in short snatches and their
bloodshot sunken eyes betrayed that the
strain was becoming unendurable then
it happened the sick mans eyes abruptly
opened and he was staring at his com-
panions quite sanely and naturally

  whats the matter hugh he mut-
tered weakly i suppose that infernal
fog stuff knocked me out have you
shut the door what are the martians
doing he queried more strongly his
eagerness of spirit fast overcoming his
sickness

  the martians laughed burgoyne as
he bent affectionately and joyfully over
his friend dont worry about them
they must be a good many million miles
astern by this time but how do you feel
-thirsty hungry he queried anx-
iously

  what you have started cried car-
scadden sitting bolt-upright in his sur-
prize why how long have i been in-
sensible

  just forty-eight hours though it
seems like years replied his friend with


weird tales

a heavy sigh of relief thank heaven
you are better and will soon be able to
skipper the neutralist again all i know
for certain is that we are somewhere out
in space and the pointers havent been
visible for ages

  forty-eight hours echoed carscad-
den here give me a hand i must see
to this forty-eight hours and going full
steam ahead he repeated as though
dazed by the notion

with a litle assistance for he was
not in any wray injured and the
poison seemed to have worked its way
completely out of his system he walked
across to his beloved registers and bent
over studying them earnestly for several
moments when he looked up again his
eyes held a queer expression an expres-
sion of mingled amazement pride and
consternation

  why didnt you move the cover
about and check the speed he asked

  well we were in the dark as to your
calculations and were afraid of either
falling back to mars or into the sun i
reckoned we were safer out here and
kobloth said there was enough air to
last us a month replied burgoyne

  yes perhaps you were safer-that
cover requires delicate manipulation but
its high time i woke up do you know
where we are asked the scientist

  somewhere out in space beyond that
i havent a notion replied burgoyne as
lightly as though he spoke of a car ride
over some new country in his own home
state

  as a matter of fact and to be more
precise we certainly are out in space
at a rough estimate we are about ten or
eleven hours run from the planet jupi-
ter when you left mars it was night
and jupiter being the nearest large plan-
et you were naturally attracted by it
see thats jupiter over there i should

have thought kobolth could have told
you that said carscadden in surprize

  hes been sleeping for several hours
-and that queer star has grown much
larger in my watch i was getting a bit
worried about it to say the truth de-
clared burgoyne apologetically

  no wonder its been growing larger
rapidly do you know we are rushing to
it at nearly ten million miles an hour
over  miles a minute and as
the planet is a little to the eastward of
mars we have traversed an arc of its
orbit of about six hundred million miles
does that satisfy your ambitions

  thats breaking records cried bur-
goyne with raised eyebrows since we
are so near to this planet jupiter why
not have a look at it a few hours more
or less cannot make much difference to
us surely

  jupiter echoed kobloth and flint
in the same breath for the two sleepers
had now awakened and had hastened to
their captain with many expressions of
surprize and relief at his welcome recov-
ery jupiter yes i thought that blaz-
ing orb was the huge planet but i could
not credit we had hurtled through space
so quickly as all that yes i should like
to have a closer look at jupiter does it
make much difference to our safety if we
hold on for a few hours longer and a
light came into kobloths dark strong
eyes that was not entirely inspired by
greed and selfish ambition for at heart
the austrian was really a scientist whose
evil instincts had been so uncontrolled
and dominant that they had wrecked
what might have been a notable life

  no i dont think it can make much
difference to us i may frankly admit
that our chances of hitting the earth
again from this vast distance are quite
a gamble but seeing that we have evi-
dence of the stupendous speed the neu-
tralia is capable of the matter of time
the voyage of the neutralia



hardly needs to be considered and the
problem of return simply resolves itself
into a matter of our ability to evade or
turn to our advantage the various centers
of attraction we shall encounter replied
the scientist thoughtfully

  and so after a little more discussion
it was decided and the great steel globe
was permitted to continue its headlong
rush through the black abyss toward the
huge orb of jupiter that giant of our
planetary family whose diameter exceeds
 miles whose day is no more than
live hours and night no longer whose
four moons race round his great girth
with a speed far in excess of our own
placid luminarys sedate behavior and
whose year contains  of its brief
days luckily there are no inhabitants to
suffer the inconvenience of such things
for the huge orb is like the sun still in a
gaseous condition and its heat and light
of its own making though its texture is
much more concentrated than the suns
tenuous immensity

  in less than two hours from his recov-
ery carscadden ordered his friend to re-
verse the cover and jupiter now a large
glowing disk of fast-increasing bright-
ness went out of sight beneath them as
they dropped with terrific but shortly
abating speed toward it exactly eleven
hours after he emerged from his stupor
he gave the command to reverse the
cover again

	near to destruction

as it swung back letting light through
l the lower windows the intrepid voy-
agers saw the giant planet below them a
huge whirling orb of glowing cloudiness
with vast tormented eddies of super-
heated gas spinning and leaping within
it across this expanse of titanic activity
a black speck moved quickly

  the inner moon explained their

captain it revolves around the planet
in forty-two hours it is nearly four
times as large as our own moon we
shall tty and land on it

  nearer and nearer sank the globe to
the huge glowing orb and distinctly vis-
ible were the curious belts of alternately
liquefying and vaporizing elements
steadily it was growing larger and soon
it dominated the black sky like a vast
crimson sun

  suddenly a tremendous crash resounded
on the globes exterior and in a moment
it was subjected to a tremendous bom-
bardment as though batteries of heavy
artillery were playing upon it the globe
vibrated and trembled with the incessant
blows and great scratches appeared oil
the outer surface of the windows the
temperature at once rose considerably
and the globes occupants panted and
perspired with every movement

  carscadden hastily wrote on a piece of
paper and passed it around for it was
impossible to hear a word in that deafen-
ing uproar

  we are passing through a swarm of
meteorites he had written they are on
their way to jupiter i think the neutra-
lia can safely stand it unless we meet an
unusually large fragment however we
can only carry on and chance to the luck
that has so far befriended us

  the supply of missiles seemed inex-
haustible and the bombardment contin-
ued for over an hour but at last ab-
ruptly as it had started the crashing up-
roar ceased shortly after on the vast
glowing disk a faint scintillation broke
out in one particular location it was the
cloud of myriads of meteorites rushing to
their destruction fused into vapor by the
friction of their passage through the plan-
ets gaseous envelope

  now the black speck of the inner
moon loomed larger and it could be seen
as a round dark object on the dull fiery


weird tales

mass of jupiter at the command of
their captain the cover was tilted a little
to shut out somewhat the direct pull of
jupiter

  the neutvalia as though tired after its
long voyage sank down slowly toward
the rapidly moving moon all going
well their paths would soon intersect
absorbed in watching this satellite the
watchers for a little overlooked the fact
that jupiter had other moons to reckon
with it was kobloth who first reminded
them of their oversight

  another moon he shouted excited-
ly pointing to a side window it is com- 
ing direct for us - we shall be run
down

  with one hasty glance at the approach-
ing menace carscadden leapt to the
wheel every breath was held as the
scientist swung the cover and it never
seemed to move so slowly for each had
seen that the neutralia dropping now
but slowly was almost directly in the
path of this rushing peril obviously the
satellite would overtake the globe unless
it could be moved quickly aside from its
present path was this to be the end-
to be shattered to fragments by a chance
collision with this passing moon gradu-
ally under their captains expert hand-
ling the neutralia came to a standstill
and hung poised in space awaiting the
fateful moment nearer and nearer
rushed the satellite bulking dark and
enormous as it came for them

  it may miss us said kobloth in a
low voice and his face was drawn and
haggard

  i have done all i can do muttered
carscadden we are now isolated from
all attraction save that of jupiter and
we shall begin to fall toward it again
directly the satellite has passed-if we
live to see it he whispered under his
breath

nearer came the hurtling black
globe so near that the men fear-
fully watching it braced themselves for
the final second of dissolution plunging
them into darkness it hid jupiter from
their view as it passed and then-light
they lived the moon had rushed past
though the clearance could not have been
expressed in distance it was a matter of
split seconds only

  that was worse than the martian spi-
ders exclaimed old flint wiping the
perspiration from his forehead

  im not stuck on another such stunt
as that myself agreed big burgoyne
with the deepest conviction

  the landing on the inner satellite was
comparatively easy and they grounded
safely on its western edge where both
jupiter and the distant sun were visible
but there was no landing on that little
world for the disappointed voyagers the
test-tubes showing no trace of atmos-
phere

  there is no air whatever on this little
world-at least none that our tubes can
detect we shall have to remain inside
while we do it announced their captain

  do what asked kobloth

  make the circuit round jupiter we
shall have to travel rather slowly for the
cover will need some very fine adjust-
ment to hold our position as we make
the circuit explained the scientist

  and after that queried burgoyne

  after that we must try and return
to our own planet i say try because it
will be a very difficult task-in fact a
pure gamble it is only right that you
should all be aware of that fact replied
carscadden gravely

  you have navigated us safely so far
aylmer and ill put my last cent on your
making it now i think ill take a
snooze i havent had a real nap since
you were bowled over is there anything
the voyage of the neutralia



to do or see that is more than usually
interesting said burgoyne

  no we shall remain on this satel-
lite and be carried round with it its
not safe to approach any closer if any-
thing happens i will call you my long
sleep has left me quite fresh so i shall
take a number of photographs replied
the scientist turning to his array of cam-
eras

  burgoyne and the austrian were soon
enfolded in their rugs but flint always
deeply interested in his masters work
watched and aided him with his cameras
from one of the windows they looked
directly down on the heaving gaseous
surface of the monster planet from an-
other the sun was visible but appeared
little more than a star of intense brilliancy
amid a host of other lesser points of lumi-
nosity as the satellite moved round its
parent orb flint remarked in surprize
that it always appeared in the same rela-
tive position to them

  should have thought it would have
gone out of sight said he referring to
the vast globe

  but this moon is like our satellite
explained his master it always keeps
the same hemisphere facing inward-its
a peculiarity moons have

  as the hours sped by they noted that
though the huge planet shone with the
dull light of its own fiery gases yet it was
markedly brighter where the sunlight fell
upon it it was new crescent half and
full in turns

  ten hours after their grounding car-
scadden made a careful study of his reg-
isters and instruments and afterward
was busy for a little while with his pencil
then he made the following announce-
ment

  since wre landed jupiter as well as
mars and the earth has moved and al-
tered its relative position considerably
from here to our planet in a direct line

is now nearly  miles our
air supply i find will last the four of us
just seventy-nine hours that is using up
the compressed stores and the reserve ox-
ygen that means that we shall have to
travel at express speed in spite of the
risk we have no margin of safety for
possible emergencies at the end of our
long journey your presence kobloth
is most inconvenient not to say danger-
ous three would be able to exist in the
neutralia for over a hundred hours if
we can avoid the one danger that i fear
we need not use the ejector door for un-
desirable passengers his voice was
quite courteous very grave and yet hard
as granite

  and that one danger is- asked

kobloth whose face had grown gray and
anxious

  the danger of starting the neutralia
at a wrong angle if we do not go abso-
lutely straight to the earth we shall in-
evitably be drawn into the sun and with
so small a reserve of air we cannot afford
to check our terrific pace in time to avert
that fate replied carscadden quietly

  when do we start inquired bur-
goyne who was impressed by their lead-
ers quiet statement

  in half an hour-if we can

	an error of a decimal

 hats to hinder us starting

   t asked flint first voicing the sur-
prize of the three listeners

  our path-i have just found that
it will take us directly across the path of
jupiters fourth satellite in half an hour
when we must cross its path it will be
there or very nearly so at least it will
be no more than  of its diameter
away from the point of intersection i
need not say that the margin is far too
narrow for safety


weird tales

  can we not wait and give it time to
pass by queried kobloth

  yes we shall have to cut that means
missing our straight line earthward but
we shall have to move as soon as this
satellite has passed the critical spot and
even then it will be a mere chance if we
miss it said carscadden

  devil take a planet with four moons
grumbled the stolid burgoyne who
seemed by far the least moved of the
three listeners

  more waiting in silent suspense then
eye to telescope their captain gave the
signal at once the great cover was
turned and the satellite on which it had
rested sank from beneath their feet and
they saw passing above them the huge
dark ball of the outermost of jupiters
attendant satellites only for a moment
was it visible so rapid was the pace
the neutralia at once attained then they
were out in the darkness and emptiness
of space homeward bound-if all went
well

  during the following hours there was
nothing to mark their progress save the
spinning pointers on the speed dials of
the register-no sense of movement
within or perception of motion without
the globe they were apparently hanging
in the center of a vast sphere of jet-black
darkness a sphere dusted with points
and streams and clusters of starry light
yet each man knew that he was being
hurled through this terrible darkness at
nearly  miles every sixty min-
utes and each man feared that the end
of this daring venture would be death

  at last sixty long hours had crawled
by now the men were inclined to be dull
and querulous for as well as the nerve-
racking suspense the air was more than
a little vitiated for the tanks did not
release a fraction more than the amount
needful to sustain the vital spark of ex-
istence and the carbon-consuming appa-

ratus did not work altogether satisfac-
torily

  at the end of the sixtieth hour both
mars and the earth loomed large again
and the sun had regained much of its
splendor it was evident that they would
pass mars at a good distance to one side
and it was also evident that their course
would take them a long distance from the
longed-for earth and the neutralia would
be governed entirely by the pull of the
suns vast mass

  carscadden worked out his calculations
anew going a long way back in his for-
mulas to make certain that no loophole
of error had evaded him and it was then
that he discovered the little slip in a deci-
mal point-a slip a careless schoolboy
might have been guilty of but quite un-
looked for in one who regarded calculus
as a mild form of recreation the discov-
ery hurt his pride far more than the fact
of the terrible danger it had led them
into such a trivial error was as a deadly
sin to the scientific mind

  the others when he told them did not
seem to appreciate the gravity of his con-
fession

  but a point i dont sec anything to
worry about said burgoyne a little con-
temptuously

  no sneered carscadden with a
most unusual bitterness i hardly
thought you would nevertheless i think
it has signed our death warrant when i
delayed our departure from jupiters in-
ner satellite it was to allow another of
the four moons to pass clear of our
course the clearance i then stated was
but  of its diameter that was
an error it should have been  on
that footing there would not have been
the least danger and we could have
started at the exact second requisite to
reach our planet safely now we shall
most certainly miss it

  miss it echoed burgoyne but

                     w t-
the voyage of the neutralia



cannot we stop the neutralia and make
a fresh start

  you mean just cruise about until the
right moment comes round again cer-
tainly we could but for our air supply
long before that moment arrives the sup-
ply would have been exhausted no it
is out of the running nevertheless we
must stop the neutralia at once as there
is just a ghost of a chance that by very
careful manipulation we might be able
to edge into the gravitational field of the
planet venus-i mean into its effective
range so far as we are concerned but
it is only a chance and a mighty slim
one aflirmed the scientist coolly how-
ever let us try it turn the cover hugh
he commanded with decision

burgoyne leapt to the wheel with re-
newed cheerfulness it was a relief to
be doing something his nature craved
activity and he became uneasy and irri-
table when denied such expression of his
superabundant energy but for the first
time the wheel seemed very hard to start
in motion surprized he put out his full
strength and strained at it still there
was no movement

  what the devil has come to it he
exclaimed angrily here you fellows
give me a hand he called to his com-
panions hastily as his face abruptly paled
at the thought which had suddenly come
to him

  that thought was also known to the
three men who flew to his assistance
but no man voiced it in silence they
pulled pushed and strained until the per-
spiration streamed from them but all in
vain-the cover would not budge a sin-
gle inch

  something has happened we are
doomed cried kobloth

  i am afraid that is the truth said
their captain grimly if we fail to move
the cover nothing short of the sun itself
w t-

can stop us and we are now isolated from
every attraction save his i ought to have
foreseen and prepared for such a misfor-
tune

  how what has happened asked
flint incredulous that any misfortune
should long defy his master

  well it seems to me that very likely
a small meteorite fragment has forced
its way between the steel globe and its
cover and so made it jam unfortunate-
ly we have no means of finding out if
this is the case or combating it if we
knew this was the trouble said carscad-
den rather wearily if there was any
hope of saving ourselves he continued
we might prolong existence a little by
removing kobloth but what is the use
when in a few hours our end is certain-
unless we can move the cover all we
can do is to face with resolution the in-
evitable as befits men

  how will it be this plunge into the
sun asked kobloth slowly

  instantaneous at the rate we shall
rush into the huge corona of flaming
gases we shall be fused into incandes-
cence quicker than a moth is consumed
in a furnace replied the scientist

  even stolid burgoyne looked startled
fused into incandescent vapor in a frac-
tion of a second it might be merciful
and absolutely painless but it was a sin-
gularly unpleasant fate to contemplate

  ten hours went by haggard-faced
breathing heavily in the vitiated air the
four men sat silent moodily staring into
vacancy and each affecting a stoical in-
difference he was far from experiencing

  the slave of science by force of habit
their captain made occasional inspections
of his dials and registers a moment ago
he had pointed to one of the windows
and announced without emotion

  we are now making 
miles an hour we have passed the
earths orbit already missing our planet


weird tales

see it is there like a huge crescent moon
in about another seven or eight hours we
shall be in the sun-and the voyage will
be ended

	a last effort venus

t t ow long will the air supply last
  ajl asked burgoyne after a little

  nearly eight hours just enough to
reach the sun replied the scientist

  and if the cover would move what
would you do

  try and land on the planet venus
hugh we should be passing its orbit
and not very far from the planet itself
in another hour replied his friend

  well here goes for one last effort
ill either break that gearing or move
the blasted thing declared burgoyne
with a sudden wrath that overstrained
nerves are prone to exhibit

  without a word kobloth leapt to his
feet and joined him and the two began
tugging viciously at the obdurate wheel
the energy and despair inspired every
ounce of muscle in the two attackers and
the gearing rattled and trembled under
the tremendous strain they subjected it
to suddenly burgoyne gave a wild shout
the wheel had seemed to move the merest
trifle

  instantly carscadden and flint flung
themselves also upon it this way and
that the four desperate men fought with
the gearing and at once a faint harsh
grinding sound was audible below them
it was the cosmic fragment being forced
between the steel wall and the cover

  an ounce more-shes coming
shouted burgoyne fiercely

  a loud rasping shattering noise and
the wheel spun round with a jerk that
sent the men hurtling over one another

hands were bleeding and bodies bruised
-but the cover was moving

  shes free weve done it cried
the four men hysterically

  they were quickly on their feet again
and rushed to a window the sun was
now beneath them and hidden from
view and in the sky overhead shone the
earth a brilliant star and much nearer an-
other as brilliant the white disk of ve-
nus now but half a million miles dis-
tant it gleamed like a great full moon
a glaring circle of light cut out of a black
background would they be able to
reach it in time and had it a breathable
atmosphere each brain was concen-
trated on these two queries

  we have barely seven hours air left
and we must now endeavor to greatly re-
duce our speed but our pace is so awful
that i cannot be sure we can effect this
in time to avail us but we have this in
our favor the neutralia isolated from
the suns attraction will begin to be re-
pelled at once so saturated with cold has
the cover now become and so near are
we to venus that its pull will be very
strong between these two forces both
impelling us in the same direction we
may be able to manage we can do no
more now just wait declared the sci-
entist impassively

  minute by minute the time sped by
and still though with ever lessening ve-
locity the neutralia sped sunward de-
spite the asbestos lining the heat grew
intense slowly the white disk of venus
receded two hours passed before the
register pointers came to rest for a mo-
ment the globe was hanging motionless
then the pointers again moved the neu-
tralia had commenced its retrograde
movement back toward venus and away
from the seething cauldron it had been
heading for
the voyage of the neutralia



relieved from the awful strain of

	their former peril the voyagers
talked and joked boisterously

  any points of interest about this dame
venus asked burgoyne flippantly

  only this known with any certainty
venus lies  miles nearer the
sun than the earth her day is forty min-
utes shorter than ours and her year only
 days long while her diameter is
nearly  miles less than the earths
there is an atmosphere of some descrip-
tion whether breathable or not we shall
soon discover and a few mountains
have been noted but little is known of
the surface also she has no moons

  no moons thank heaven for that
cried burgoyne fervently

  little by little the reserves of air and
oxygen sank steadily nearer to exhaus-
tion the neutralia had not yet reached
the atmosphere of venus when their cap-
tain announced the end of the seventh
hour already he spoke and breathed
with much difficulty we are very near
the journeys end in ten minutes we shall
be a mere few miles from the surface of
venus then either the air is breathable
or- and he left the sentence unfin-
ished

  now the planet loomed gigantic be-
neath them blotting out everything save
its vastness a pleasant-hued world it
was shaded and lit by various markings
as of land and water wherever its sur-
face could be glimpsed between heavy
cloud masses it was so near but so was
extinction the last breath of oxygen had
been released and in a few moments their
lungs would be gasping and strangling
for lack of it the three friends turned
dull fierce eyes on kobloth but for him
the air supply would have been ample
and to spare from the start he had been

their evil genius and had forced himself
upon them it was but simple justice that
he should be sacrificed for the common
weal and he had richly earned his fate
burgoyne and flint staggered toward
him himself gasping and choking the
austrian read his doom in their eyes
and shrank away from them

   at that moment a shrill shriek that
rose to a loud roaring filled the neu-
tralia

  stop gasped carscadden we are
in the atmosphere we land in a min-
ute

  the windows whitened and dulled
and ran with steam as the neutralia fell
headlong through the damp cloudy lay-
ers shrieking and glowing with the last
remnants of its great pace luckily the
atmosphere of venus was extensive and
dense and aided in arresting their descent
the roar abated the windows cleared
and a forest of waving tree-tops was vis-
ible beneath then with a terrific jar
that threatened to loosen every bolt-nut
plate and rivet the neutralia struck the
ground rocked violently a little and
then was at rest

   the test-tube gasped the scientist
hoarsely

  the door-if we die for it choked
burgoyne as he swung madly on the
lever and before carscadden could in-
terfere kobloth had staggered to the
lever also the great door swung open
and a blast of damp dense air chilly by
comparison with the fetid air within the
globe but pure as liquid life to the suf-
focating men swept upon their faces
they breathed in gulping inhalations-
they breathed and lived

blneasy lie the drowned

by donald w andrei

crossing the lake in a canoe morse ran into a horror-a stark hideous horror

   that crept over the side of his canoe

he watched the graying sky
anxiously but without fear and
kept his ears attuned to the gusts
of wind that pulled the waves higher
he had made many direct crossings of
lakes in the past alone both in high rid-
ing and heavily laden canoes this lake
was new to him it was miles across he
did not know its depths and shallows its
lily clusters beds of weeds or the way it
responded to squalls

  the sky had been clear when he started
out a deep rhythmic stroke of the pad-
dle and a twist of the blade out and
forward down and back again each
time that he brought the paddle astern
an expert drag on the blade kept the
canoe on its straight course it was a sim-
ple trick he could go on for hours
stroking steadily on the right but mid-
way to his goal and still unwearied he
switched over to the left

  as often happened in fall along the
border lakes a squall was brewing a
mass of slate-black clouds bloomed out of
canada and swallowed the setting sun
he changed his pace increased the power
of his thrust and pull sent the canoe
skimming more swiftly across the waters

  the lake hitherto calm began to
spawn groups of nervously racing ripples
the wind chased them in all directions
over the surface they vanished and left
a deceptive tranquillity until more of the
uneasy whirls and lines skittered along
a swell gradually made its presence in
slow undulations then in an occasional
small wave that broke and always higher
swells and more strongly marked crests

     

  the water itself leaf-green at mid-
afternoon darkened as the sun disap-
peared the green turned to a sodden
blue and went down to a dull black
and far under that black four hundred
feet and more lay the solid rock that
formed the deep-gouged bed of all these
northern lakes rock and the sediment
of centuries saturated logs perhaps the
wrecks of sunken boats and bodies of
the drowned for the pike and the mus-
kellunge to forget

  even the stillness had given way to dis-
turbing sound the constant quiet slur
of waters divided by the canoe became a
slap at irregular intervals and with
mounting force the canoe no longer
gliding at even balance began to rise a
little dip a little and the lake smacked
the fore keel from the far distance came
the advance echo of a mighty rushing
howl the dark mass of pine and spruce
that lined the shore now less than two
miles ahead stirred with mournful un-
rest the air grew colder

  during all the summers that morse
calkins had spent canoeing and hunting
camping and fishing through the lakes
and forests of northern minnesota he
had not until now experienced a doubt of
his mastery his alarm crept up from his
heart to his brain because he could not
account for the apprehension he had
been lost in the woods had rescued him-
self from a capsized canoe outdistanced
forest fires escaped the charge of a full-
grown moose he had survived many a
squall yet the germ of an obscure panic
haunted him less than two miles to the
uneasy lie the drowned



camp where the three companions of this
expedition awaited his arrival

  there came a lull

  as though a gigantic invisible hand
closed over the canoe it lost momentum

  instantly aware of the drag he could
not understand it none of the possible
causes that he was familiar with seemed
adequate reason a bed of weeds-there
was no shallow here only bottom hun-
dreds of feet down an added weight-
he had not yet shipped water the pres-
sure of wind-the wind blew fitfully not
steadily not enough to retard him a
drift of current-perhaps but currents
were more common to rivers than lakes

the canoe lagged further his senses
alert to every mood of the craft
warned him of pressure astern for some
strange incomprehensible motive he kept
his eyes glued on the dark forest and the
black mountains of clouds ahead the
prow of the canoe tilted upward higher
than it should rise to crest a wave

  he stroked suddenly deeply the mus-
cles knotting at his shoulders and the
veins rising on his arms while his
knuckles stood out in naked bony lumps

  the canoe slowed to a standstill the
bow rode still higher all his strength
and power his hardest paddling could
not move the canoe he saw the sweat
seep from wrinkles at his wrist but the
swart hairs were half erect odd hot
and cold-he couldnt be both

  morse turned and glared all at once
as if expecting to find someone else in
the canoe someone to curse

  there was no one else in the canoe-
yet but there was a hand clutching the
stem and the fingers of another hand
crawled into sight sliding over the rim
morse watched them with an expression
of detachment it was almost a silly ex-
pression for the anesthetic of shock had
paralyzed him in one instantaneous flood

  a pair of hands-well why not a
swimmer whom he hadnt noticed-or
the exhausted survivor from a boat that
had foundered-but the hands wouldnt
have inched their way up with so stealthy
an approach these thoughts floated
vaguely somewhere in back of his reeling
consciousness no swimmer no living
human being ever possessed hands of
such soapy fatness

  they slid along the side those plump
bloated fingers and found a grip he
couldnt make out a trace of knuckles or
joints or veins the nails were entirely
missing only thick coils remained like
enormously pudgy gray-white worms

  above the stern rose a tangle of hair
it was wet matted then the forehead
and eyes and face except that of these
there existed only a swollen fissured
blob the features of one drowned and
immersed for months

  to morse it seemed that his arms and
legs would never carry out his command
that his body drifted through lazy ges-
tures akin to a slow-motion picture yet
he found himself bringing the oar blade
down again and again on those horrific
hands he was not aware of having made
a mad lunge forward that almost capsized
his craft or of whirling around and lift-
ing the oar above his head only his
hammering upon the fingers and head of
the corpse there in all that tumult of
wind and waters formed a positive
reality

  he could not pound or pry them loose

  the lips curled around the distended
protruding tongue-an illusion bred of
darkness and terror it couldnt be nor
the gasped whistle of an inarticulate at-
tempt at speech like the hiss of steam
escaping he didnt hear it he couldnt
hear it above the rumble and boom of
thunder

  thunder-of course in the old days
cannon had been fired to roil quiet waters


weird tales

and bring to the surface bodies of the
drowned the thunder the roaring re-
verberating claps and wild wind over the
lake had raised this dead thing from its
lodging the rest was imagination
mustnt let his nerves go

  he heard a husky gurgling rattle
once he had listened to a dying soldier
whose message bubbled away upon the
bullets that had punctured his lungs
this was a sound more appalling be-
cause of its deliberation and the words
choked on the wind dont morse i
came up to see you i had to see you i
was pete leroy

  morse didnt know that he shouted
there was frenzy in his voice it rode the
storm go back where you came from
i dont care who you are ive got to
make camp-a storms coming up-get
away from here damn you why dont
you go back

  the oar thudded slipped off those fat
fingers morse wondered what insane im-
pulse drove him to talk aloud you cant
talk to the drowned

  i cant go back morse ive got to
know you ive got to talk to you i had
to come up you see my canoe sank and

i drowned-

  no no go down where you be-
long was that crazed babble his
what made him answer ghost-words
that he dreamed

  i will but not yet i drowned by ac-
cident morse it shouldnt have hap-
pened i wasnt prepared i hadnt lived
as long as i was supposed to i ought to
have gone on living if i had id have
met you id have become a friend of
yours we would have made plans to-
gether we would have seen a lot of each
other

  the thick blurry speech submerged
the gusts that now began to lash the ris-
ing waters morse wished that the gale

would scream down a million-fold louder
and blast into oblivion those corrupt
words and that hoarse voice

morse panted-and he himself found
time to doubt if he made such soft
persuasive answer - i dont want to
know you whatever you are

  but i want to know you morse cal-
kins you see if i hadnt drowned
months ago-was it months i dont re-
member time doesnt mean anything to
me now if i hadnt drowned if i had
managed to -get across the lake safely
id have known you well by now so
when i felt you pass over me something
tugged me you pulled me up where i

could see you-

  no no i didnt have anything to
do with it get back

  oh yes you did morse you com-
pelled me to come up pete leroy-you
never heard the name before did you

  i dont want to hear it again let me
go ive got to reach camp before the
storm breaks at its worst why dont you
just let go and drop back

  i will but not yet i have something
to do that i didnt have time to do when
i was pete leroy and living im dead
now maybe im not pete leroy but
the part of me that remembers pete le-
roy knows what he would have done if
hed kept on living that part of me felt
you coming over the surface of the lake
i had to rise up i had to come as i am
and im here as i am because theres a
mission ive got to carry out its the
same mission that i couldnt carry out
when i drowned but that i must have
carried out if id gone on living

  morse was hitting slashing jabbing
again with the oar the flat of the blade
struck the monstrous head with sickening
mushy thuds he pried at the rotten fin-
gers but they slid along the side and
uneasy lie the drowned

i

clung as though glued to the withes he
was breathing harshly the spray that
had begun to blow made his own hands
slippery and glistened wetly on the gray-
white thing at the stern

  please morse said thickly and
again go away go down and then
suddenly his voice went screeching up to
a high thin crescendo let go damn
you youre dead and drowned get
down and rot where you belong

  the fingers bashed into loathsome
pulp by the blows from the oar curled
over like talons what was left of pete
leroy said in the same guttural drawl
as before yes morse ill go when ive
accomplished my mission ive got to go
down where i belong then i havent
told you why i came dont you want to
know

  you said you had to see me youve
seen me isnt that enough are you go-
ing to hang on till doomsday

  dont you know why i came what
my mission is

  for gods sake let go morses
voice was getting raw his howl ended
on a sort of piping whistle his eyes
were beginning to glare he had for-
gotten the storm he didnt realize how
dark it had become how blackness came
rushing across the lake to merge with the
rioting waters his whole world had
narrowed to those pulpy hands and the
fat featureless face that lay under the
tangle of hair

  the horrible voice gurgled again with
a noise of drowning a rattle of death
its a strange destiny that drives me
morse i dont understand it any more
than you do sometimes i think i almost
know then it slips away from me in
the life that i should have lived i would
be here now to kill you

  to-to-kill- morse choked

there was a gagging in his throat that
he couldnt gulp away

  yes to kill you you see morse if
id gone on living my natural life id
have got to know you wed have been
friends for a while and then wed have
quarreled and turned bitter enemies
wed have hated each other as much as
we liked each other before but wed
have tried to suppress our hatred be-
cause wed have been on this long camp-
ing-trip and then today wed have start-
ed across this lake and our hatred would
have flared into the open and youd have
made a dive for me and id have knocked
you overboard and paddled away leaving
you to drown

  its you who should have gone down
morse calkins and i who should have
gone on living

the slow creepy speech died away
morse saw tiny rivers running down
the face and the hands from the torrents
of rain that now deluged the lake the
wind had stormed up to a gale and the
waves had begun to crash in foaming
white-caps into the dips dropped the
canoe and slid up the six-foot crests and
shipped the breaking spume

  morse lurched drunkenly his eyes
felt like flaming coals his hair was plas-
tered to his scalp streams of rain trickled
down his face sloshed down his back
squished into his boots

  the gray-white visitor bobbed with the
rise and fall of the canoe the soft fat
hands did not relinquish their grip the
dead decaying head stayed always at the
stern

  with a cry that was more like a hoarse
bleat morse dived for the fingers yam-
mering as he tried to pull them loose
their touch was a dreadful sensation that
made him gag in crazed horror he beat


weird tales

and pounded them while the rain glis-
tened like tears on his yellow face

  the double weight on the stern stood
the canoe straight on end as it started to
mount a roaring white-cap it plunged
beneath the surface morse pitched out
the pudgy hands oddly seemed to be
clinging to his and then they had some-

how enfolded him and he was beating
frenziedly at something that had long
been pulp

  his last upward glance showed him
only raging blackness and the drive of
rain

  he was still fighting when the waters
closed over his head

of kara kedi

by claude farrere

an odd little story about a cat that was telepathic-by a member
of the french academy

january  

i have been writing all the evening
alone in my room alone in my little
house in the uncomprehending city
of toulon the lonely refuge i have crept
into to get away from the world when
a man tires himself out when he takes
too strenuous a part in the various pain-
ful agitations of active life he growls old
rapidly i have not yet lived fifty years
on this earth but my hair is white and
my thoughts are as gray as ashes   

  i am writing in my room all alone
alone in a sense that is my black cat
is with me he is asleep curled up in
his armchair which is an exact duplicate
of mine he and i spend a great deal of
time together in these great heavy twin
chairs upholstered in tan velvet my
black cats name is kara kedi which is
turkish for just that-i mean for black

   translated by roy temple house

cat i didnt waste a great deal of
imagination in naming him kara kedi
was born in turkey at stamboul in the
holy suburb of eyoub that was back
in the days when i was deep in love with
the circassian girl ah how blond her
hair was and how brown her skin was
and how sweet her kisses were

  but there is no burning passion in my
cottage tonight kara kedis chair is
comfortable and he sleeps very soundly
so that i am really alone in my room
alone in my dreary little house

  my little house is a gimcrack of a
place with a little garden that runs all
around it to the right and left are little
gardens very much like mine about tiny
little houses very much like mine my
neighbor on the right is a very dirty
very polite and very deaf old sailor my
neighbor on the left is a pretty little
young woman very charming and very
candid who is constantly laughing and
the keen eyes and ears of kara kedi



rattling her bracelets as she gambols
about in her sunny little garden she has
a great many friends all of them gentle-
men and i am afraid they do not all
come merely for the sake of a look at her
pretty face and the pleasure of hearing
her silvery voice but of course it isnt
any affair of mine what they come for
and they are reasonably quiet about it
so that i scarcely know when they come
and go

  at night our part of the city is abso-
lutely quiet it is so still at night that
even when the sea is calm i can hear it
lapping lazily against the rocks for the
sea is not many feet away from me i
could see it from my windows if my win-
dows were not so low but as it is the
cabins of the fishermens families hide
the sea away from me

  but tonight for some reason or other
i cant hear a sound of any sort not even
the caressing whispers of the waves it
is too calm even for that there is not
a hint of a breeze in the air not a ripple
on the surface of the sea the winds
and the waves are asleep quite as soundly
asleep as kara kedi my black cat

  kara kedi in his velvet-upholstered
armchair is as completely motionless as
if he were cast in bronze i cant see his
paws or his tail or the exact shape of his
head he is rolled up into a tightish ball
with a soft outline of ink-colored fur
kara kedi is an enormous cat i think
he is probably the biggest cat i ever saw
you could scarcely call him fat he is
not one of those round formless cats
you see sometimes who doze day and
night because they have more fat flesh
than they have energy he is longer
larger-boned taller on his feet than the
ordinary house-cat when he crosses my
garden gravely gracefully but with un-
mistakable evidence of personality and
power to meditate in the branches of the

great fig-tree at the end of my garden
my little neighbor on the left says he
makes her nervous she tells me that she
is almost afraid of him and since her
zoological attainments are not extensive
enough to include black panthers she
reproachfully calls him a big awful bear

i am writing at this journal of mine   
there is a great feeling of calmness
and peace about me in the room and in
the house  in the garden and in all
the quiet night that reaches out be-
yond   

  i discover that my pen is empty i
raise my head and reach out my hand
for the inkwell  ah kara kedi is
not asleep any longer his head has sud-
denly emerged from the placid ball of
dark fur his head moves upward and
forward and his glaring eyes fix them-
selves on the dim rectangle of the win-
dow and i can see that his pointed
ears have turned straight upward he is
listening with all his might

  kara kedi old fellow is there some-
thing wrong out beyond that window

  kara kedi is still motionless and si-
lent but i can see his ears twitch in a
gesture that tells me he has heard me
but implores me to be quiet he is right
there is no reason why i should distract
his attention from the faint and distant
noises which may mean much by the
noisy futilities of human speech   

  they do mean much i am sure of that
something is wrong mysteriously wrong
kara kedi rises upright on his four long
strong legs his head held straight for-
ward and his long tail standing straight
out behind him he has disdained the
thousand-year tradition of cats awakened
from a nap he has not stopped to arch
his back to yawn to stretch himself mag-
nificently there must be something
ominous in the air or at least it must


weird tales

seem ominous to kara kedi    perhaps
it might seem less so to me   

  it is a serious matter in kara kedis
opinion there is no longer any doubt
about that kara kedi descends from the
armchair and walks toward the window
he walks resolutely determinedly like a
strong nature meeting a crisis when he
left his chair he did not leap down from
the chair to the floor he lengthened
himself out muscle after muscle until he
touched the floor with one paw then
with a second then with a third and a
fourth  i realize perfectly by this
time that i must maintain an absolute
silence kara kedis head moves for-
ward till his nose touches the strangely
disquieting window-pane then very
slowly the great body swings around
till it faces toward the wall which lay to
the animals left before my windows
are so low that i can see the great pan-
ther-profile now standing out rather dis-
tinctly against the faint light of the win-
dow i should not be able to see him so
distinctly if the animals hair had not
suddenly risen to a perpendicular all over
his body and begun as i had seen it do
once or twice before on very stormy days
to emit a myriad of tiny crackling electric
sparks

  kara kedi kitty whats the mat-
ter with you

  miaul

  it was not kara kedis usual miau
of inquiry petition or complaint it was
merely an expression of impatience kara
kedi so courteous on most occasions is
nervously irritated at my foolish prattle
i accept his rebuke in all meekness i
shall not breathe another sound

  kara kedis eyes are fixed on that left
wall with glaring insistence the eyes are
two green flames of dazzling glory all at
once the great feline turns his head and
gazes at me and-it sounds supremely
foolish-and i am unable to ward off a

feeling of superstitious dazed terror i
am as sure as kara kedi is that something
ghastly is happening out beyond that
wall it is a feeling nothing more there
is no trace of rational knowledge   

  kara kedi phosphorescent from his
tail to his mustache moves entirely away
from the window then he begins to
creep straight along that left wall as if
he were following step by step some un-
known being which moved or was moved
slowly along on the other side of the
wall kara kedi is making no apparent
use of his sense of smell he is listen-
ing with all the intense keenness of his
ears and he is looking looking with all
his eyes    the wall is covered widi
a plain gray paper and i cant remember
ever to have seen anything on that wall
or that paper which had anything unusual
about it   

 oh-oh

  kara kedi draws himself together
and with all the power of his marvelous
muscles he flings himself backward into
the room away from the wall he runs
around in a bewildered circle his tail
thrust out perfectly stiff he looks this
way and that for a place to flee to i can
see that he is driven by blind and agoniz-
ing terror he is so troubled that his
mind and his memory are not function-
ing he has forgotten that i am there to
guard and protect him as i have done
so many times before it is only after a
long period of anguish and dashing
madly hither and thither that his dazed
eyes chance to meet mine the message
of my presence reaches his poor fuddled
brain at last and suddenly like an ani-
mal hunted for prey he flings himself
toward me he leaps to my knees but he
does not stop there he crawls deep into
my arms up against my breast he buries
his head between my neck and my
shoulder but he is unable to resist the
wretched fascination that keeps drawing
the keen eyes and ears of kara kedi



his eyes toward that miserable wall that
wall of pain and horror

  and his trouble has taken possession
of me the frightened cat has driven his
fear into the very marrow of my bones
i am paralyzed with craven foreboding
like the cat i am unable to move my
eyes from the mysterious gray wall the
wall which is hiding from me some
blood-curdling happening that i have not
the courage to try to imagine kara kedi
trembles and shivers in the protecting
grasp of my two cold hands then sud-
denly an even more terrible thing
happens

  kara kedi tears himself free from my
embrace drops from my knees leaps
into the air three or four times and falls
to the floor in violent convulsions his
throat is torn by raucous cries cries
which are no more like the familiar
miauing of his normal life than the sin-
ister gurglings of an epileptic in the
midst of a seizure are like the healtiiy
human voice   

    

  i think i suffered a temporary period
of derangement i have a feverish recol-
lection that i seized my revolver and
stood a long time with the weapon
pointed at the ominous wall waiting for
the wall to open and admit some shape
of terror   

jan 

my poor pretty young neighbor the
giddy little person of accommo-
dating virtue whose bracelets rattled so

gayly in her sunny garden is dead they
found her body this morning

  nobody has the slightest inkling of
what the motive of the crime may have
been the assassin docs not appear to
have taken anything the poor little
corpse still wears all its gaudy jewelry
nor was there any sign of a struggle or
of violence an extraordinarily long
gold pin an ornament but a deadly
weapon at need was found driven into
her body below the fifth rib and the
eyes of the dead woman wide open and
staring are dilated with a horror that is
one of the most dreadful things i have
ever seen

  everybody is mystified nobody saw
anything nobody heard anything it is
likely that the mystery will never be
solved till the body was found nobody
had any suspicion that anything was
wrong

  nobody that is but kara kedi-kara
kedi and i

  kara kedi followed me over when i
went into the little cottage to look at the
body he glanced carelessly at the pathetic
little corpse then he looked away it ap-
pears that dead people have no particular
interest for kara kedi but he did look
at me again with a strange earnest
expression in his eyes

  then he walked out of the open door
crossed the garden pensively and moved
out on a branch of the great fig-tree to
meditate to meditate - perhaps to
ruminate his memories
ragment

 by robert e howard

and so his boyhood wandered into youth

and still the hazes thickened round his head

and red lascivious nightmares shared his bed
and fantasies with greedy claw and tooth
burrowed into the secret parts of him-

gigantic bestial and misshapen paws
gloatingly fumbled each white youthful limb

and shadows lurked with scarlet gaping jaws

deeper and deeper in a twisting maze
of monstrous shadows shot with red and black

or gray as dull decay and rainy days

he stumbled onward ever at his back
he heard the lecherous laughter of the ghouls

under the fungoid trees lay stagnant pools
wherein he sometimes plunged up to his waist
and shrieked and scrambled out with loathing haste
feeling unnumbered slimy fingers press
his shrinking flesh with evil dank caress

life was a cesspool of obscenity-

he saw through eyes accursed with unveiled sight-
where lust ran rampant through a screaming night
and black-faced swine roared from the devils styes
where grinning corpses fiend-inhabited

walked through the world with taloned hands outspread
where beast and monster swaggered side by side

and unseen demons strummed a maddening tune

and naked witches young and brazen-eyed

flaunted their buttocks to a lustful moon

rank shambling devils chased him night on night

and caught and bore him to a flaming hall

where lambent in the flaring crimson light
a thousand long-tongued faces lined the wall

and there they flung him naked and a-sprawl
before a great dark womans ebon throne

how dark inhuman strange her deep eyes shone

winds from the north curse and whine
and the red-leaved trees of the swamp
mutter things to one another in the small
hours of the morning under the horned
waning moon i sit by the casement and
watch that star down from the heights
reels the glittering cassiopeia as the hours
wear on while charles wain lumbers
up from behind the vapor-soaked swamp
trees that sway in the night wind just
before dawn arcturus winks ruddily from
above the cemetcry on the low hillock
and coma berenices shimmers weirdly
afar off in the mysterious east but still
the pole star leers down from the same
place in the black vault winking hid-
eously like an insane watching eye which
strives to convey some strange message
yet recalls nothing save that it once had
a message to convey sometimes when
it is cloudy i can sleep

  well do i remember the night of the
great aurora when over the swamp
played the shocking coruscations of the
demon light after the beam came
clouds and then i slept

  and it was under a horned waning
moon that i saw the city for the first
time still and somnolent did it lie on a
strange plateau in a hollow betwixt
strange peaks of ghastly marble were
its walls and its towers its columns

domes and pavements in the marble
streets were marble pillars the upper
parts of which were carven into the
images of grave bearded men the air
was warm and stirred not and overhead
scarce ten degrees from the zenith
glowed that watching pole star

  long did i gaze on the city but the
day came not when the red aldebaran
which blinked low in the sky but never
set had crawled on a quarter of the way
around the horizon i saw light and mo-
tion in the houses and the streets forms
strangely robed but at once noble and
familiar walked abroad and under the
horned waning moon men talked wisdom
in a tongue which i understood though
it was unlike any language i had ever
known and when the red aldebaran
had crawled more than half-way around
the horizon there were again darkness
and silence

  when i waked i was not as i had
been upon my memory was graven the
vision of the city and within my soul had
arisen another and vaguer recollection of
whose nature i was not then certain
thereafter on the cloudy nights when i
could sleep i saw the city often some-
times under the hot yellow rays of a sun
which did not set but which wheeled low
around the horizon and on the clear
nights the pole star leered as never be-
fore

  gradually i came to wonder what
might be my place in that city on the
strange plateau betwixt strange peaks

                                   


weird tales

at first content to view the scene as an
all-observant uncorporeal presence i now
desired to define my relation to it and to
speak my mind amongst the grave men
who conversed each day in the public
squares i said to myself this is no
dream for by what means can i prove the
greater reality of that other life in the
house of stone and brick south of the sin-
ister swamp and the cemetery on the low
hillock where the pole star peeps into
my north window each night

one night as i listened to the dis-
course in the large square contain-
ing many statues i felt a change and per-
ceived that i had at last a bodily form
nor was i a stranger in the streets of
olathoe which lies on the plateau of sar-
kia betwixt the peaks of noton and
kadiphonck it was my friend alos who
spoke and his speech was one that
pleased my soul for it was the speech of
a true man and patriot that night had
the news come of daikos fall and of the
advance of the inutos squat hellish yel-
low fiends who five years ago had ap-
peared out of the unknown west to ravage
the confines of our kingdom and many
to besiege our towns having taken the
fortified places at the foot of the moun-
tains their way now lay open to the pla-
teau unless every citizen could resist with
the strength of ten men for the squat
creatures were mighty in the arts of war
and knew not the scruples of honor which
held back our tall gray-eyed men of lo-
mar from ruthless conquest

  alos my friend was commander of all
the forces on the plateau and in him lay
the last hope of our country on this oc-
casion he spoke of the perils to be faced
and exhorted the men of olathoe bravest
of the lomarians to sustain the traditions
of their ancestors who when forced to
move southward from zobna before the

advance of the great ice sheet even as
our descendants must some day flee from
the land of lomar valiantly and victori-
ously swept aside the hairy long-armed
cannibal gnophkehs that stood in their
way to me alos denied a warriors part
for i was feeble and given to strange
faintings when subjected to stress and
hardships but my eyes were the keenest
in the city despite the long hours i gave
each day to the study of the pnakotic
manuscripts and the wisdom of the zob-
narian fathers so my friend desiring not
to doom me to inaction rewarded me
with that duty which was second to noth-
ing in importance to the watch-tower of
thapnen he sent me there to serve as the
eyes of our army should the inutos at-
tempt to gain the citadel by the narrow
pass behind the peak noton and thereby
surprize the garrison i was to give the
signal of fire which would warn the wait-
ing soldiers and save the town from im
mediate disaster

  alone i mounted the tower for every
man of stout body was needed in the
passes below my brain was sore dazed
with excitement and fatigue for i had
not slept in many days yet was my pur-
pose firm for i loved my native land of
lomar and the marble city olathoe that
lies betwixt the peaks of noton and kadi-
phonek

  but as i stood in the towers topmost
chamber i beheld the horned waning
moon red and sinister quivering through
the vapors that hovered over the distant
valley of banof and through an open-
ing in the roof glittered the pale pole
star fluttering as if alive and leering like
a fiend and tempter methought its spirit
whispered evil counsel soothing me to
traitorous somnolence with a damnable
rhythmical promise which it repeated over
and over

       stars that soothe and stars that bless

ary of three thousand dollars a year
rather regretted his acceptance he felt
as if mysterious tentacles of miasmic jun-
gle swamps breathed poison in the per-
fume-laden off-shore wind it was like
the breath of a black panther he took
professor denhams letter from his pock-
et and read it again

  five years before willoughby had
been a student under professor denham
in the university of california and had
gained a name for himself as a football
star he had regretted the circumstances
which prompted professor denham to re-
sign the chair of science under the storm
of ridicule and protest resulting when a
newspaper featured the scientists asser-
tion that sea-serpents really existed the
article was illustrated by a cartoon of pro-
fessor denham and chueng ching a
chinese student who was his especial
protege and devoted to denham in the
coils of a serpent labeled public opin-
ion depicting the agony of the laocoon
there was the account of class experi-
ments in transplanting the brain of one
rat to the head of another and of the
practical joke perpetrated by a student
assistant in substituting the brain of-a fe-
male rat for that of a male which led to
riotous speculation on the campus as to
the outcome of the experiment

  willoughby had been sorry for pro-
fessor denham it was however the
three thousand dollars salary that decided
him to accept denhams offer and take
the next steamer from san francisco east
re-embarking on a trading-schooner for
papua and denham was to send a boat to
take him to his own habitation

  the letter which he re-read within
sight of landing had emphasized the ne-
cessity of a strong fearless man with-
out nerves willoughby interpreted the
phrase with a new meaning now that he
recognized the repellent fascination of
papua

  he had no sooner stepped ashore than
a chinese in oil-stained dungarees ap-
proached him and spoke

  you allee samee mista willbee you
come long my boat

  he had scant time to bid farewell to
his acquaintances of the trading-vessel
when he was led to a launch lying on
water so clear that she seemed to be float-
ing on air her propeller churned foam
and she careened a little as they rounded
the point then for hours the launch raced
along the coast where jungles brooded
and river mouths showed no banks but
only trees rooted in swamp fighting a
loneliness he could not analyze willough-
by watched sea gardens beneath and tried
to reason away a lowering depression
the chinese ignored his tentative ap-
proaches to conversation by unbroken and
stoical silence

  in the late afternoon with her engines
slowed to half-speed the launch entered
a lagoon where echoes of her pulsations
disturbed boobies on the wreck of an old
ship pronged on coral spurs the lagoon
water held gaudy little fish scattering like
sparks between skeleton-white roots of
drowned trees sea life had made the
wreck its prey white decay crept up her
sides and she wras rooted to abysmal
depths by weeds a small wharf sagged
under forest creepers with tendrils trail-
ing in the sea the planks creaked alarm-
ingly as willoughby trod them following
the boatman and met the shrill hum of
insects the heat was like a furnace blast
he was aware of a throb like tic-doulou-
reux pulsing incessantly as if on distant
hills the heat had a voice

  what had once been a path leading
from the wharf was now overgrown the
chinese lathered with sweat slashed
with a knife at trailing vines orchids
quivered like flames the incessant hum
of insects rose in loud crescendo but as
they progressed the trail became less con-

                     w t-
laocoon



fused with looped lianas sunlight fil-
tered through brandies overhead and
ever nearer came that slow beat of sound
touching nerve centers as insistently as
the insect humming irritated the ear-
drums

  then the jungle was ended and wil-
loughby saw a bamboo palisade enclosing
ground that had once been cleared and
under cultivation yet the jungle beaten
back had swarmed again choking the
garden creeping over the palisade and
the crushed coral walk which led to a
substantial dwelling with nipa-thatched
roof and a vine-covered pergola leading
to shore rocks which rose abruptly at one
side it was then that willoughby under-
stood that diapason of sound the shock
of outer seas breaking in subterranean
caverns

the chinese who had guided him did
not enter the gate but darted beside
the palisade willoughby heard no sign
of human presence save the shir-rr of
his boot-soles on the coral then a chi-
nese wearing the white ducks of a house-
boy appeared in a doorway cut through
luxuriant bougainvillea vines purple with
bloom he stood staring at willoughby
with his hands twisting together for a
moment willoughby felt again that sense
of helplessness bred by the jungle the
fear of encroaching death

  tell your boss-man that willoughby
is here he said

  he followed the chinese into the
house the large living-room was shaded
and cool chinese matting covered the
floor sea-grass chairs offered ease there
were wall cases filled with labeled speci-
mens of sea denizens a table holding a
typewriter and note-book and some loose
pages of script the house was clean and
orderly yet he still felt as if the jungle
lay too close for safety

   w t-

  boss-man he come bimeby ven-
tured the chinese plaintively

  wheres chueng ching willough-
by knew the chinese student had accom-
panied denham to his retreat and it was
rumored provided funds for the scien-
tist

  him gone long time i not know
much the reply brought a grimace
from the house-boy as of apprehension

  you got one piecee ship i go out
longside he added plaintively then
darted back at the sound of steps as
professor denham entered

  willoughby was shocked at the change
in him denhams skin seemed stretched
over his bones his eyes shone like those
of a madman the hand extended to wil-
loughby felt cold and lifeless as that of a
corpse in spite of tropic heat

  glad you arrived willoughby he
said youve come too late to see chu-
eng ching today but hell be here to-
morrow well eat then you can rest
youll excuse me if i write a few notes
right away ive just come from chueng
ching and i must get them down at
once

  willoughby was a little surprized but
he followed the house-boy to a room with
a bed screened by netting took off his
shoes collar and coat and dropped on the
cotton covering and dozed he was awak-
ened by the clink of dishes in the living-
room a table was set for two but den-
ham did not appear

  the house-boy hovered near serving
willoughby eagerly and when the coffee
was brought voiced again his wistful plea
you got one piecee ship i go out long-
side

  he seemed to hang on willoughbys
answer plainly the chinese was in the
grip of fear and the white man remem-
bered again the encroaching jungle and
the derelict rooted to sea gardens he
wished denham would return and went


weird tales

on the porch to look for his host he did
not mind the lack of courtesy but the si-
lence and oppression were affecting his
nerves tropic night had fallen the mos-
quitoes were vicious beyond the mur-
mur of sea caverns he heard nothing and
returned to the house to look at the speci-
mens in wall cases then to reach the
typewriter stand where he glanced at a
sheet still in the carrier without con-
sciousness of reading something not in-
tended for him willoughby glanced at
the typing in view

  there is now no doubt but that phys-
ical coarseness of the beast has absorbed
the fine mentality of chueng ching i
fed him double the usual amount of
chicken yesterday and he was in a fine
rage for more his roarings are bestial
the pool was lashed to foam by his fury
and i am assured that his rage was di-
rected toward me his friend and com-
panion it is scarcely a year since he was
sorrowful at the thought that i should
die before he died and leave him alone
now he is all brute and i am punished
he no longer heeds my voice 

  as if the writer had been interrupted
at his task the sentence was left unfin-
ished willoughby read with mingled
rage and horror evidently chueng ching
had gone insane and he had been hired
to care for a madman he resented it
yet he was virtually a prisoner on the
island unless he could find the boatman
who brought him he stood a moment
wondering what to do the little house-
boy lingered near him constantly without
giving the impression of watching but
shook his head when willoughby de-
manded to see denham

  no can do he said plaintively

  willoughby went through the cur-
tained doorway into a room evidently be-
longing to chueng ching to judge by the
embroidered tapestries moving in the
draft chests of carved teak stood be-

tween wall cases a table held metal
tubes with sealed ends and addressed to
the royal college at pekin willoughby
heard the squawking of hens and ran out-
side into the pergola of vines a lantern
stood beside a bamboo coop and profes-
sor denham was wringing the neck of a
hen and tossing it on the ground while he
reached for others he looked at wil-
loughby and it seemed to him that den-
hams eyes held mingled fear and mad-
ness

  then he heard the sound of water
threshed as if by storm although there
was no wind and not a leaf of the vines
stirred

  chueng ching said denham hun-
gry again such gluttony i wish youd
arrived earlier but its difficult to see him
at night go into the house willoughby
and read those notes youll find ill re-
turn presently and tell you all about
him

  denham gathered the slaughtered hens
and darted down the vine-covered pas-
sageway of the pergola there was the
sound of an iron door banged shut the
repeated noise of water threshed violent-
ly and willoughby returned to the house
where he took up the typed script ar-
ranged the pages according to numbers
and glanced over them fear horror fas-
cination held him he forgot where he
was he was unaware of the house-boy
standing mute near his chair seeking
companionship in a fear that was sapping
his life willoughby sat on the edge of
his chair hair slowly rising scalp prickly
his palms moist with cold sweat

sct have now the evidence that ocean

faction of all is the proving of my theory
that sea-serpents as they are popularly
called do exist and that their armor of
scales and longevity has preserved some
of them to this day the cavern pool is
an ideal spot for such a sea denizen to
lurk chueng ching told me that he had
heard rumors of this haunted cavern
when we were both in california and he
is as delighted as i that we have found
the thing and my years of research are
rewarded   

  it is three months since i added to
this diary chueng ching is despondent
the white spot which he tells me has
been spreading for a year is only too
plainly evidence of leprosy chueng
ching is accursed doomed to a lingering
death a tragedy for both of us he feels
it keenly because we have found what we
sought and for him there will not be
time to pursue the study of die sea-ser-
pent we spoke last night of the re-
strictions of mans limited span of life
the pity that we are not given enough
years even centuries for research one
envies the sea-serpent which is undoubt-
edly older than whales older than the se-
quoias of california much older than the
christian era to judge by his length and
the size of his armor plates our dragon
is centuries old i said to chueng ching
that i wished i could inhabit his body
and not only live indefinitely but also ex-
plore the ocean depths learn his man-
ners of living and perhaps find his rela-
tives chueng ching seemed startled ra-
ther than amused   

  two months later this morning
chueng ching asked a terrific thing of
me he pleaded the growing decay of
his flesh his fingers are already numb
he believes that i could give him the
magnificent body and strength of our
sea-serpent a thought suggested no doubt
by those experimental tamperings of mine
in college surgery substituting the brains

of one rodent for those of another but
i could not do such a thing chueng
ching is a man a brother to me a fine
mentality a higher organism

  willoughby ripped open his shirt
longing for a cooling breath on his skin
the shadow of the house-boy fell across
his feet the brown hands were twisting
mutely the page he had just read fell
to the floor and he seized the next

  chueng ching has worked out an ar-
rangement by which he is confident we
can manage the operation the steel net
will confine the sea-serpent a collar of
steel will hold his head while i shoot
ether from a spray-gun the bench the
instruments the cauterants are ready
only i am afraid if it were not that
chueng chings fingers and toes are al-
ready sloughing away i could not do this
thing he pleads all day and moans all
night tomorrow i shall be alone save
for the house-boy wi wo and the boat-
man who is hired to call here at regular
intervals

  there was the rustling of the page
which willoughby crushed in tense fin-
gers as he took it up and the sound of
his heavy breathing

  chueng chin wakened with a great
fear although he assures me that he went
under the anesthetic not only reconciled
but even rejoicing in a resurrection of
which he felt surer than i did he felt
no pain only fear and the sense of a great
weight dragging him down no doubt
the serpent body is not yet under control
of nerve telegraphy of the mind i at-
tribute his fear to the same cause time
will cure both troubles today i made
out the first of his attempts to communi-
cate with me there is no doubt he
speaks but i scarce understand his words
roared in that tremendous voice i spent
hours with him and had wi wo fetch
my meals i asked questions to which he
could reply by a nod or shake of his great
 

weird tales

crested head what a pity those fools
who ridiculed my assertions that sea-
dragons do exist cannot see this triumph

  the vitality of chueng chings body
is prodigious he revived quickly from the
ether the leprous shell of my poor
friend is in the ocean depths sewn in
canvas weighted with iron the sea will
sing a requiem but chueng ching is
now invulnerable and magnificent noth-
ing could harm that marvelously con-
structed coat of mail unless it is some
device of man the destroyer

  willoughby lifted his head and
brushed his hand across his eyes he was
entering into horror that chilled his flesh
a nightmare he could not and would not
believe he abominated the crime of
denham yet was fascinated

  he will not take meat yet we fed the
sea-serpent he now inhabits at regular
intervals on raw flesh but since the
change chueng ching will not touch it
no doubt the higher mentality of an
esthete has subjugated the beast body
today i prepared another roll of notes
for the royal college of pekin a rare
collection of data which will receive con-
sideration from chinese savants that i
could not wrest from my own people
chueng ching and i have proved the ex-
istence of sea-dragons and the ability of
science through martyrdom to penetrate
to the mysteries beneath the waters

willoughby mopped his face wi
wo held a tray toward him and he
took a bottle it held and poured himself
a peg of brandy then seized the next
page

  chueng ching is timid of the dark
his fear throttles our investigations and
much that he would impart is lost
through my faulty understanding of his
articulation the curse of babel rings
down the ages he breaks into cantonese

in his endeavor to enlighten me the
finer details would be invaluable but i
hoped too greatly i cannot understand
his fear and his rather pathetic regret at
the loneliness he will find when i am
dead but one thing comforts me he is
taking food and prefers rather under-
cooked chicken and pork i must keep a
stock on hand as his appetite is pro-
digious   

  six months since i last wrote those
notes chueng ching has furnished me
with priceless specimens and data of the
ocean depths the notes of which i seal
daily in metal tubes to be sent to pekin
but i notice a change in him while at
first he was afraid of the depths he now
goes fearlessly and remains for a longer
period each time the silence down there
must be fearful but he seems to like ex-
ploring and has even identified geo-
graphic indentations of continent shores
and recognizes the chill of polar seas   

  three months from my last entry
another period of change has come over
chueng ching the little fish spewed
from his jaws are spoiled by carelessness
things are not going so well there is a
change of temperament and his articula-
tion is thick for a time he spoke clearly
although in a voice like a church organ
now he roars in sullen rage when i re-
fuse to feed him before i obtain an ac-
count of his wanderings i believe it was
a mistake to feed him flesh better to
have left him to find sea-food only i
wonder if the brute body is in ascendance
or if meeting other monsters of his own
kind has upset him he would know no
means of communication with them and
no methods of defense but what a spec-
tacle it would be to view a battle of sea-
dragons i wish it had been my lot to
change from a human to this saurian i
am past middle age and the passions
which plague a youuger man chueng
ching who in his human shape was
laocoon



vowed to celibacy and had devoted his
life to science is seeking a mate he was
never more lucid than when he roared to
me that he had found a sweetie the col-
lege slang of old days for a sweetheart
and demanded more food for strength he
would need to fight off other males of
his kind with great sorrow i must ad-
mit the end is in sight he is indifferent
to our researches and i gained nothing
today but the account of this female sea-
dragon which seems coy and exhibits
greater speed and endurance than chueng
ching as they tear through the depths
circling islands lashing a riot of phos-
phorescence in the night oh to see
them to find another and change from
this body hampering me to a saurian like
chueng ching

  cold sweat broke out on willoughbys
forehead as he took the last sheet from
the typewriter and re-read the bit which
had fascinated him a little while before

  he understood perfectly what denham
had written of the change over this
thing the brute body had conquered the
mind of chueng ching the ferocity of
the sea-dragon was in ascendance he
had turned on denham no longer obey-
ing the voice of the scientist the re-
mainder of the page held no less of hor-
ror a prophetic intimation of denhams
fear

  chueng ching is a fiend he struck
at me today with open jaws i have
sealed the complete notes to date and
addressed the results of my researches to
the royal college at pekin where they
will act on the instructions to use the bal-
ance of chueng chings wealth to pursue
this investigation in case anything should
happen to me but willoughby has ar-
rived and i am confident that the skill
he displayed in the science class can be
enhanced by practise so that he can per-
form the operation i desire chueng

ching laughed when i told him my plan
but promised to entice another male of
his kind to the pool where willoughby
and i shall trap him by means of the
iron-barred gateways dropped behind this
sea-dragon we used as a body for the
brain of chueng ching i have not talked
to willoughby about it but i noticed he
seemed as well set up and fit as in college
days his reward shall be a share of
giueng chings wealth and the fame
of-

  willoughby crushed the sheet in his
hand every nerve in his body on edge
his breathing sounding loud in the silence
the chair crashed over as he rose and
stared past wi wo at the curtained door-
way the embroidered dragons seemed
to move with malignant life and a more
terrible dragon inhabited this place the
madness which had caught denham and
made of him a priest of more dreadful
rites than voodoo of the jungles

  willoughby realized now for what he
had been summoned by the scientist he
must escape or be caught in a trap from
which there was no escape he would
find denham and tell him that he was
going denham was at that moment near
the pool willoughby remembered the
chickens he had been killing and his
words chueng ching hungry again
such gluttony he remembered the
sound as of water threshed by storm
denham feared the thing yet he had
gone to it again he might be in danger
of his life common decency demanded
that willoughby try to save the man as
for remaining under the conditions to be
imposed his body shivered as if with
nausea at the thought

  under the vine-covered pergola he
was startled by the sight of wi wo in
his white ducks the hand of the chi-
nese fell on his arm the mans teeth
chattered like castanets and above the


weird tales

chattering and willoughbys breathing
came the sound of water crashing on
rocks threshed under flails of no wind
that ever was

willoughby stalked down the per-
gola gripping his courage in his
hand assuring himself the typing was the
fantasy of a madman and that the worst
he would find would be denham in the
violence of insanity brought on by lone-
liness and the eery mystery of the island
the heelless slippers of wi wo shuffled
reluctantly as they came near an iron
door with light from beyond shining
through the space between heavy bars
willoughby saw the lantern on the stone
floor steps led down there was the
crash of waves subsiding gradually and
a low moaning audible

  willoughby opened the iron door
snatched up the lantern and began to
descend the steps a cool wind swept
upward a smell of sea-wrack and cavern
chill he saw the oily luminance of
water where the sea filled a natural cove
it was stirred as by violent upheaval from
beneath the rock ledge below glistened
with minute sea life he saw something
resembling a huge horse-collar slung to
iron rings in the cavern roof and a steel
net dependent from ropes the apparatus
of that operation performed on the sea-
dragon along one side was a litter of
things scarcely discernible by the faint
lanternlight

  with his scalp prickling willoughby
held the lantern at arms length to learn
what manner of gigantic bird it was that
ran to and fro on the ledge uttering
squawks of fear which the cavern echoed
he saw a heap of dead chickens on the
ledge then a movement of wi wo
caught his eye the chinese was retreat-
ing up the steps backward his eyes star-
ing at the pool his hands groping along

the rock wall willoughby looked again
at the pool straining his vision to see
what had thralled wi wo and turned his
yellow skin green with terror

  it came like gushing light in the
depths stirring the black water a radi-
ance of glittering unrest undulating flit-
ter and shadow faintly phosphorescent
then coils broke a moving swirl in the
gloom

  willoughby turned to run up the steps
the breath of wi wo hissed between his
teeth there was the silken slur of water
washing the rode and in another moment
willoughby was crowding the chinese on
the steps for the water parted and a crest-
ed head wras upreared water dripping
from fanged jaws red tongue quivering
large glassy eyes regarding the two men on
the steps with malevolent glaring coils of
a serpent body upreared willoughby saw
the great scales like iridescent metal
plates there was that threshing hiss of
water tremendous in the cavern walls
willoughbys heart was pounding in his
throat and wrist fear paralyzed him

  then he screamed from that great
throat came a roar that swelled and
boomed and in that sound willoughby
heard unmistakably the name of den-
ham howled in wrath

  his own scream seemed to be echoed
by the flapping white thing on the ledge
for the first time he realized that he had
lost the chance for what he came to do
to save denham that was denham-
that mad disheveled thing clad in white
ducks which was bent nearly double
weaving its coat-tail over its head it stood
erect laughing horribly

  chueng ching it called did you
bring your sea-dragon see willoughby
is here willoughby who will make me
invulnerable so we can rove the deeps
together 

  the rest was drowned in that howl of
the sea-dragon a burst of laughter
boomed through a gigantic throat and
the crested head swooped at denham
the sea leaped a wave shot by those
armored coils crashed up the steps and
over willoughby the lantern fell from
his numbed fingers the sea was in his
mouth

  then he felt the hands of wi wo
clutching him they were crouched in a
heap on the steps the pool was dark
and the seas fell quiet willoughby felt
his way a few steps lower and saw the
outer archway of the cove dawn had
bloomed early tropic dawn shone silver
the ledge was empty denham had dis-
appeared

  willoughby turned and pushing the
terrified chinese before him went up the
steps clanging and bolting the iron door

  he strode through the house looked
at the sealed tube of notes addressed
ready to send and at the typed account
of denhams crime then he went to
the porch

  a voice at his shoulder startled him
you got one piecee ship i go out long
you the plaintive wail was chattered
through quivering lips

  come on snapped willoughby and
ran down the path

  along the palisade sauntered the chi-
nese boatman willoughby took money
from his pocket and offered it

  take us back to port he com-
manded quick

attention of our readers to a new
feature that we are inaugurating
this month a series of full-page pictures by
virgil finlay illustrating famous weird pas-
sages of verse the first of these is based on
a passage from george sterlings a wine of
wizardry-a passage so striking that am-

famous passages from coleridges kubla
khan and keatss ode to a nightingale
which dante gabriel rossetti called the two
pillars of hercules of modern human imagi-

of weird literature let us know what you
think of this feature

ilere it is

  gertrude hemken of chicago writes
once again i present myself in epistle-
form this time with thanks to david h
keller for his tiger cat-the leddy in the
tale had a fine way of getting revenge for
that sad instance in new york-i appreciate
doctor kellers finesse in letting the read-
ers know how a woman can feel about being
mistreated one would almost believe a
woman had written the story i am all in
sympathy with the tiger cat although her
demise did not sadden me    icky-one
of those slimy tales-and by hpl-wooeey
the shunned house was something far be-
yond my imagination the more i read of


lovecrafts works the more i see in them
the modern poe-by his minute detail of
every angle-the history of the family which
built the house-the exact description of the
plot of ground in which this ancient dwell-
ing stood a person could almost draw a
map of the site-on such things i find hpl
so very like poe i caught myself gasping
a bit when reading of the containers of
sulfur being emptied on that blasphemous
slime and of the resulting fumes dear me
how awful it would be if such really hap-
pened and then the question comes to
my mind that perhaps it did occur al-
though the homicidal diary was not the
type of tale i now associate earl peirce jr
with i did find it fascinating-very what
strange things dreams can do to one-and
what strange dreams a person can have-
and what strange things hypnosis can make
one do gruesome yes-retchingly so
but why cant we have another on the order
of the last archer what about it ep
well now lemme see-dunno just what to
say about the long arm-the whole thing
just sorta disappointed me-wasnt quite
nasty enough for my gluttonous taste gosh
im getting to be a real fiend thrills and
adventure galore-do i like this lake of
life am looking forward to the next in-
stallment and then for more yarns like it
darkest africa holds so many strange se-
crets-i find it more fascinating than the
orient mr hamilton has me on my toes
wondering what the guardians are and what
force they have released on the ring of
mountains to discharge instant death to tres-
passers wellman writes the most curious
tales of the oddest things coming to life-
well sort of a tangible existence last time
it was a parchment-now its fat and bulging
cherubs that just aint cherubs nasty things
werent they here lies was a laugh-getter
weird tales



-but-what was so weird about it is my
mind getting dull  the outstanding story in
this months issue-to me-was your reprint
of richs the purple cincture i could see
those terrible glowing colors-angry colors-
i could see them so plainly and could see
the suffering of those afflicted-my nerves
twitched as though that searing pain were
severing my foot and hand-i didnt dare
think of my neck now for the eyrie-i can
add no more to your answer to g m wil-
son on his astonishing accusation-the very
idea of him-how dare he do such to wt
-my gawsh-he doesnt read the magazine
thoroughly enough good gosh-if a per-
son is going to read wt with a grain of
salt how the deuce can he get any pleasure
out of it the idea is to leave ones mind
open to all possibilities and forget how its
gonna end-the day is past and gone when
the fair-haired boy rescued the beauteous
maiden from a fate worse than death just in
the nick of time some stories must end that
way but the people these days demand va-
riety-and variety is what they get one
time the hero or she-hero dies or is overcome
-next time they escape but not unscathed-
and mebbe the third time they run true to the
old-fashioned style if gmw has any old
copies of wt and should he glance through
them he will find that he has been very un-
just i can say no more reginald a pryke
of kent england writes so grandly of how-
ard what i have never been able to express
should i never keep a copy of wt-id
keep this one for the fine tribute he has
paid howard and his incomparable creations
of mankind let me take this opportunity to
thank mr pryke for a fine letter-ive read
few as good in the eyrie once again i
ask-who is wc jr sort of a wt walter
winchell-eh wot i liked the random
biography wc jr gives of clifford ball-
its such things as these that we readers want
to know of the authors-just bits of human
news which we know will make them seem
more real to us will we have more of such
inside stuff-please

man can now
talk with god

 says noted psychologist

   a new and revolutionary religious teaching
based entirely on the misunderstood sayings of the
galilean carpenter and designed to show how we
may find understand and use the same identical
power which jesus used in performing his so-
called miracles is attracting world wide attention
to its founder dr frank b robinson noted
psychologist author and lecturer

   psychiana this new psychological religion
believes and teaches that it is today possible for
every normal human being understanding spiritual
law as christ understood it to duplicate every
work that the carpenter of galilee ever did-it
believes and teaches that when he said the
things that i do shall ye do also he meant what
he said and meant it literally to all mankind
through all the ages

   dr robinson has prepared a  word treatise
on psychiana in which he tells about his long
search for the truth how he finally came to the
full realization of an unseen power or force so
dynamic in itself that all other powers and forces
fade into insignificance beside it-how he learned
to commune directly with the living god using
this mighty never-failing power to demonstrate
health happiness and financial success and how
any normal being may find and use it as jesus did
he is now offering this treatise free to every
reader of this magazine who writes him

   if you want to read this highly interesting
revolutionary and fascinating story of the discov-
ery of a great truth just send your name and
address to dr frank b robinson  th st

weird tales

kept on reading it here as enthusiastically as
there i never wrote to you before mainly
because the great distance between our coun-
tries discouraged me but also because  think
all these readers letters must be a bore to
you so i shall be brief i only want to
congratulate you for the ever increasing
quality of your magazine which now stands
as unique in its kind being an artist though
not a professional one i am really delighted
by the very good drawings that illustrate the
stories i wish to congratulate madam brun-
dage in particular for the splendid picture
she made for the october issue the girl is
the most fascinating representation of a
woman i have ever seen you forget the
ghastly thing she is doing when you look
at her loveliness generally speaking the
whole magazine is a priceless gift for all
lovers of the unusual and weird i hope i
shall be able to read it for many years to
come

orchids to mr pryke

  pete thompson of seattle writes my
first fan letter i have been reading weird
tales for about three years off and on and
really think you have finally reached the
acme of perfection tiger cat by d h
keller was tops in the october issue as was
the homicidal diary    orchids to you
my dear reginald a pryke of kent eng-
land-your harangue on reasons for not re-
viving conan or any of the other brain
children of our past master wt authors
hits the spot really ive wanted to say the
same things thanks for putting into words
what ive wanted to but lacked the ability

poe outshone

  george w skora of tucson arizona
writes a devoted reader of weird and
science fiction i have been reading weird
tales for the last eight years although i
am a singularly imaginative person i do not
read our magazine for the revolting shud-
dery terrifying aspcct of its stories but for
the occasional tales becoming more numer-
ous of late which translate me mind and
body to some other age or to some other
world where i can indulge my fancy in
swords-play in adventure in the mystery
romance and superstition of another time or
another dimension perhaps such reading
forms an escape for me from reality and
allows me in my mind at least to indulge

and participate in the action of other periods
i am most grateful to weird tales for do-
ing this for me and diese modern masters
of weird fiction so far outshine poe and his
contemporaries that there is absolutely no
comparison it is as though a twenty-watt
bulb were expcctcd to shine the dazzling
light of a carbon arc such tales as sham-
blean the three marked pennies the
black gods kiss all the barbaric adventures
of conan the cimmerian of jirel of joiry
of king kull and such odiers as the fasci-
nating globe of memories the last pha-
raoh which was one of the greatest stories
i have ever read red nails the masterful
clicking red heels the carnal god the
hounds of tindalos all of the northwest
smith stories and in the present issue the
best of the jules de grandin stories i be-
lieve pledged to the death which impressed
me very favorably all of these and numerous
others will live for ever in my imagination
and i often go back and read them over to
recapture their mood weird fiction has lost
perhaps its two greatest masters howard
phillips lovecraft and robert e howard
and with them the heroes which they created
have died no more will conan the bar-
barian fight from one end to the other of
those mysterious half-legendary lands no
more will he woo and win fair maidens in
his inimitable fashion no more will he defy
warrior and king alike for the master pen
which created him is no more and with that
passing conan is likewise gone for ever i
cannot conceive of his being recreated by
anyone with the mastery of robert e how-
ard and hence would radier see conan dead
as he had lived a fighting-man who per-
ished as he would have wished sword in
hand the grim smile of desperate battle on
his lips in his ears the din of clashing blade
and shouting men who felt its cunning edge
that world of his is gone it would be
blasphemy to attempt the rebuilding from
dead ashes and in closing let me mention
one more story whidi i will long remember
the fire of asshurbanipal a thrilling story
if ever there was one on rereading this let-
ter i once more feel the futility of mere
words to say the things or express the
thoughts that i really feel you have one of
the finest magazines one of the finest staffs
of artists and authors of any publishing
company in this country and i do not say
this with intention of flattery i really mean

it and with sincerity i would buy weird
tales if it were a dollar a copy much as it
would strain my pocketbook i have no
faults to find other than the desire that
brundage would give us an occasional bru-
nette on the cover of the mag and i would
personally like to see one cover in black and
white merely for the striking effect it would
give

like rare old wine

  natalie rockwell of syracuse new york
writes how does an ungrateful little
wench like myself express her gratitude for
the really great pleasure youve given her in
your incomparable magazine wt ive
been reading your mag for years tho im
only  but ive never screwed up enough
courage to tell you about it just finished
your october issue to the accompaniment of
a luscious thunderstorm i always try to keep
from reading it till i have the proper atmos-
phere its a darned hard job tho not to
take a little peek at the intriguing book
waiting my pleasure on the table the lake
of life and pledged to the dead are tops
in that issue ive always liked jules any-

way he seems to be so human and lovable
now even if this is my first letter may i
please make one little criticism brundages
gals are really delightful in form and color-
ing and i love to copy them to see how
nearly i can approximate her figures-but-
her expressions are so terribly monotonous
i always know just what the faces will look
like before i see the cover its the eyes that
do the dirty work no horror no nothing in
them they look as tho they were all
poured from the same mold please please
for the sake of those who like to see really
expressive features put some life in the eyes
now ive finished my ranting and raving
and can only sit and wistfully think of the
next wt thats so far away give us more
and more weird woeful tales of the same
excellent quality of the past your mag is
like good wine that mellows with age and
leaves a better taste every time its quaffed

weird tales

lightfully satirical little piece and i espe-
cially liked die illustrations for the shunned
house and the long arm trudy hem-
kens reference to my bad grammar did not
pass unnoticed and trudy may expea a call
from oliver my pet ghoul some fine even-
ing he told me he thought hed drop in

it happened one night

  manly wade wellman writes from new
york city mr joseph allen ryans letter
in october wt anent the idea back of my
short story the terrible parchment impels
me to give the real genesis of the thing-
even more unusual than mr ryans account
the idea came to me all of a sudden rather
late one night i sat down at once and
wrote it out roughly with my apartment for
setting and my wife and myself for char-
acters it was almost morning when i wrote
the end and i laid it aside then polished
it up the following evening after that i
took it to julius schwartz my agent with
him was mort weisinger they glanced over
the story and their mouths fell open look
here they said both at once not five days

ago we were discussing- after that they

told the story mr ryan tells of how they
imagined die necronomicon materializing
through the combined mental effort of many
readers of lovecrafts tales yet neither had
communicated with me as both will be
ready to testify we laughingly decided it
was a case of thought-transference-an un-
conscious mental message sent and received
i wonder if anybody has a better explana-
tion

a conte cruel

  j vernon shea jr of pittsburgh writes
the october number is another good issue
i read the shunned house with a feeling of
sadness for the many references to provi-
dence made it seem a post-delayed letter
from h p l the story is not quite of his
best for it has the over-slow approach and
the lingering on technicalities that marked
some of his last work nevertheless the cul-
mination is startling and the artistry veri-
tably impeccable i doubt if any of your
writers will ever quite attain the high stand-
ard of lovecraft at his best tiger cat is one
of the best things doctor keller has done
but the story falls into the genre of the conte
cruel rather than of the weird tale proper

nowadays die conte cruel is a little passe
for the horrors of war narrated in any news-
paper far surpass the artificial horrors
quinns tale is better than usual almost in
the vein of his the phantom farmhouse
wellman again rings the bell with the gol-
otba dancers and habls the long arm is
ifferent more european writers should be
represented in weird tales i read with
distaste peirces the homicidal diary an
hysterical and cheap melodrama to dem-
onstrate its inadequacy compare it with mrs
belloc lowndes brilliant handling of a simi-
lar theme the lodger or with such motion
pictures as m and night must fall it oc-
curs to me that the eyrie readers might be
interested in some statistics for instance
which writer has appeared most frequently
in wt quinn derleth howard why
not give a chart listing the most printed
writers and giving such data as number of
serials number of novelettes number of
short stories number of short shorts num-
ber of poems number of reprints we
fear that such statistical data would interest
only a select few of our readers and would
take up space that could otherwise be used
for stories-the editor

happy vs unhappy endings

  clifton hall of los angeles writes i
thought the second part of hamiltons new
serial the lake of life was the best story
in the octobcr number it reminds one a
little of a dime thriller but makes fasci-
nating reading tiger cat by keller stands
second in my estimation although i think
it was a mistake to reveal the nature of the
cellars contents by means of the blurb and
the two illustrations third spot i think
should go to quinns pledged to the deatl
however i have one criticism to make in
connection with die de grandin series if
id had as many dozen hair-raising experi-
ences with creatures from another world as
trowbridge has had i dont diink id have
to be convinced during every new adventure
that such things are possible yet i cannot
recall a de grandin story in which the
frenchman has not had to argue for some
minutes with his skeptical friend before the
latter realizes that the improbable is not
necessarily die impossible lovecrafts last
was okay i guess but i didnt think the
climax stupendous enough to justify the
long and at times tedious building-up proc-
weird tales



ess the homicidal diary i considered to
be the best of the others the orange-haired
creature on the cover stood out brightly
against the dark background-an arresting
bit of work but how about another fin jay
cover its been four mondis since his last
and now for g m wilson who says that
weird tales is not an interesting book be-
cause everyone knows that everything will
come out hunky-dory i checked back over
the stories-exactly  of them including
reprints-that have appeared in the ten is-
sues dated  and found out a surprizing
fact the was an exact split---
between the happy and unhappy endings
of course it was difficult to definitely place
many yarns in either classification but in
the end the advantage lay on neither side
it is improbable that in any other magazine
can you find such an amazing balance in
endings

the october issue

  julius hopkins of washington d c
writes the october wt is a real treat
for any lover of weird fiction two excel-
lent stories vie closely for first place namely
the shunned house by h p lovecraft and
the homicidal diary by earl peirce jr i
am giving the slim edge to mr peirce be-
cause in his story the horror is still at large
and furthermore is of great current interest
because actually the famous cleveland be-
header has not been captured yet and not
even any clues as to his identity have been
found the homicidal diary is written in
plain convincing language and certainly does
make your heart beat fast especially in that
scene where jason carse is rapidly becoming
over-excited and the sharp butcher knife is
close at hand thats a real spine-chilling
scene for you the shunned house is an-
other typical lovecraft tale written as only
h p l could ever have done it the slow
summation of facts builds a solid foundation
for the surprize ending the big horrible
surprize though so terrible it seems unbe-
lievable becomes a reality under the master-
ful handling of this marvelous writer who
has sadly passed on into the great beyond
i award second place to the shunned house
but this time second place is really a second
first place for third place i pick the long
arm by franz habl i enjoyed this yarn be-
cause it is something a bit different and it
leaves in your mind the question of whether

   the cream of
   weird fiction

    wfird tales prints the best weird
   fiction in the world today the high
   literary quality of its stories is evi-

weird tales

or not banaotovitch is still alive thats the
kind of a thrill i like

hamiltons serial

  b m reynolds of north adams massa-
chusetts writes you were certainly for-
tunate in securing that splendid yarn the
lake of life by edmond hamilton an ex-
ceptional piece of fantasy of the a merritt
type worthy of taking its place beside those
two fine fantastic novels williamsons gol-
den blood and kelleys the last pharaoh
i believe that these stories will always be
remembered by us the readers    second
best story in september was the ho-ho-
kam horror stories of this type are par-
ticularly effective when written in diary form
and mr bryan did a good job with this
one good build-up and abrupt ending
not a bit far-fetched either as superstition
mountain the heaven of the rattlesnakes is
a very real and tangible locality as any
pueblo or navajo indian will attest and the
place is most certainly taboo at least for
the white man psychopompos by the late
genius h p lovecraft was certainly unique
serving to make us realize still more the
great talent that was lost by his untimely
death  oh yes i nearly forgot to com-
pliment henry kuttner on h p l his
grand tribute to lovecraft the finest piece
of poetry since howard wrote a song out
of midian about ten years ago

end of the abyss

   a murphy of augusta georgia
writes my my now just look what you have
gone and done last month upon reading
the abyss under the world i just knew
that you had found another one that could
be placed with the best of them i went by
the news stand every day or two waiting for
the september issue to come in and when

i	did get it i had to read the finis of the
abyss under the world before i even came
home and what do i find upon reading
it but that you let j paul suter go and put
an ending like that on it why does any-
one have to be like that now if they had
really been transplanted into another world
and had followed the priest in his jump into
the abyss i think everyone would have been
happier because there would have been more
thrills to come

random notes by w c jr

  what a break for the washington weird
tales club seabury quinn who reads the
fashion magazines so his heroines may be
clothed stylishly is shipping the furniture
from brooklyn to washington  as if to
compensate for the old marsters absence
from die skyscraper city earl peirce jr and
bruce bryan may migrate to nyc taking
up writing as a regular profession    h p
lovecrafts psychopompos a tale in rime
was one of his earliest efforts dating from
    virgil finlay seldom uses models
but refers occasionally to photographs to get
the right effect in picturing various textures
virgil was born in rochester new york
twenty-three years ago his first attempt at
drawing occurred at the tender age of three
when the magnificently limned equine of his
imagination was labeled doggy by his
mother he attended several grammar
schools in and about rochester and his first
real claim to fame was established when
block-print caricatures of his teachers were
reproduced in the john marshall high
school paper he studied at mechanics in-
stitute classes and the gallery in rochester
he has exhibited in oils pen and ink pencil
and block-print and also works in tempera
transparent water color charcoal wood-cut
stone chalk and clay-preferring pen and
ink to them all virgil is a quiet young man
unmarried with a serious face that often
lights up with a broad smile athletics in
earlier years won him a fourteen-inch bicep
and stubby powerful fingers he often
spends two or three days on a single draw-
ing for weird tales beginning work
around noon and ceasing only when dawn
tinges the night sky a dreamless sleep then
shuts him from the material world until noon
again when he repeats the process he has
a keen sense of humor and the way he
plays practical jokes on his fellow weird-
ists for instance clifford ball once stated
in a letter to the eyrie previous to publica-
tion of his first story that the ridiculous
theme of a womans being captured and car-
ried off by a giant ape was passe with this
in mind virgil selected that particular scene
in illustrating balls thief of fort he   
what is perhaps his most famous drawing
the strange dark illustration for robert
blochs the faceless god was the result of
a dilemma in the story there was little ac-
tion which could be portrayed graphically

so as the only alternative virgil took lines
which bloch had used purely as atmosphere
virgils favorites among his own drawings-
of which he has done more than one hun-
dred for farnsworth wright including the
shakespeare work-include those for sea-
bury quinns witch-house pearl norton
swets the medici boots and of course
blochs the faceless god he considers his
conception of sterlings vampire in this is-
sue about the best he has done for wt
and is most enthusiastic over the poetry
series it introduces he is a shakespeare and
milton fan he generally does considerable
research and experimentation in preparing
for any particularly difficult piece of work
before painting the cover for speers sym-
phony of the damned he modeled the three
figures in clay and played lights on them
from below in order to get the correct light-
ing effect    paintings and other samples
of the media he employs are to be seen
everywhere in the finlay residence his
studio of course is full of them an excel-
lent portrait of his mother adorns the upper
hallway and still-life paintings hang down-
stairs in parlor and dining-room the attic
shelters a whole flock of diem while scores
of drawings rest under tables and benches in
the wood-working shop outside the bath-
room chest-of-drawers resembles a portable
art gallery    virgil is a favorite cor-
respondent of many notables in the fantasy
field as evidenced by the remarks they have
passed in letters to me to them he is weird-
ly known as monstro ligriv his high-
school nickname was curiously hyphen-
an abbreviated form of the salutation hi
finlay he says his biggest thrill came
when an old italian he knew after seeing
some of virgils drawings turned his back
and crossed himself

concise comments

  richard f jamison of valley park mis-
souri writes if anyone is fated to equal
lovecrafts genius henry kuttncr is that
man his stories have that indescribable
something that every truly weird story must
have

  jean van wissink of chicago writes
if all pages of the october issue but those
of the dike of life had been blank id
still have had my moneys worth edmond
hamilton seems especially worth hanging
on to

  r n nicholaieff of chicago writes
lovecrafts the shunned house rates first
place in the october issue i read this tale
three times just because i liked the way it
was written lovecraft was indeed a master
of weird fiction

  seymour kapetansky of detroit writes
no two writing styles could have been fur-
ther apart than those of h p lovecraft and
robert e howard yet both were masters of
weird fantasy its lucky we have such tal-
ented writers as henry kuttner and robert
bloch to carry on

  a v pershing of anderson indiana
writes hamiltons the lake of life is
weird and extremely interesting as fine as
he already is lies getting better

  edward landberg of brooklyn writes
in - you published two reprint nov-
els frankenstein by mrs shelley and the
wolf-leader by dumas of which the read-
ers disapproved you then stated that you
would cease to publish serial reprints that
was a mistake if you dont mind my saying
so it was not the idea of the serial reprints
that the readers disliked although at first
glance it would seem so but it was the
stories you chose they really were not fit
for a modern readers consumption

  henry kuttner writes from beverly hills
california i enjoyed most of the talcs in
the september issue and the ones i did not
shall go unnamed bruce bryan makes a
highly auspicious debut and his familiarity
with his subject lent a pleasing air of authen-
ticity to the ho-ho-kam horror as for
school for the unspeakable ive developed
into an ardent wellman fan since reading
such little masterpieces as this and the
kelpie

klaus kicked aside the curtain ar the doorway and looked into the darkness of the
little- house a woman crouched cross-legged on the earthen floor her hair unbound
 her gown ripped open to expose her breasts on her knees very quiet but not sleep-
ing lay a baby boy and on the little breast there flowered a crimson wound klaus recog-
nized it-a gladiator knew the trademark of his calling-a sword-cut half a hands-span
long ragged at the edges sunk so deep into the baby flesh that the glinting white of breast-
bone showed between the raw wounds gaping bloody lips

   who hath done this thing the northmans eyes were hard as fjord-ice and a grim-
ness set upon his bearded lips like that they wore when he faced a cappadocian netman
in the circus who hath done this to thee woman

   the young jewess looked up from her keening her eyes were red and swollen with
much weeping and the tears had cut small rivulets into the dust with which her face was
smeared but even in her agony she showed some traces of her wonted beauty

   the soldiers she replied between breath-breaking sobs they came and smote anil
slew there is not a man-child left alive in all the village oh my son my little son why
did they do this thing to thee thou who never did them any harm oh woe is me my

firstborn only son is slain-

    thou liest woman klauss words rang sharp as steel soldiers do not do things like
this they war with men they make no war on babes

   the mother rocked her body to and fro and beat her breast with small clenched fists
the soldiers did it she repeated doggedly they came and went from house to house

and slew our sons-

   romans klaus asked incredulously cruel the romans were at times but never to
his knowledge had they done a thing like this romans were not baby-killc-rs

   nay the soldiers of the king romans only in the armor that they wore they came

marching into town and-

   the soldiers of the king herod   

   you cannot afford to miss this mystic story of the yule-tide and a barbarian from the
north in the roman army a reverent tale of the crucifixion and pontius pilate and a
hetaera from the house of mary the magdalene this fascinating and unusual novelette
will be published complete in the next issue of weird tales
