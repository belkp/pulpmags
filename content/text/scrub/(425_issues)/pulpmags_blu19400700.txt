do you have that constant urge to write
but the fear that a beginner hasnt a chance
then listen to what fulton oursler editor

greatest of writing men and women have passed

their places who will be the new robert w
chambers edgar wallace rudyard kipling
and many others whose work we have published
it is also true that more people are trying to
write than ever before but talent is still rare
and the writer still must learn his craft as few
of the newcomers nowadays seem willing to do
fame riches and the happiness of achievement
await the new men and women of power

of a british officer and his wife makes public this story of
a great adventure written by the distinguished author of
the stolen march and storm music 

when i came down from ox-
ford in  to enter the
family business in crutched
friars my uncles let me see
that though they were bound to make
me their junior partner they did so
against their will

  i do not blame them at all they were
grave elderly men to whom business
was a religion and the service of solan
and solan the article of their faith since
i was twenty-two and had nothing to

show for my costly education-unless
you count six oars and one very good
friend-they naturally looked askance
at a colleague so young and so unprom-
ising

  it was this overt suspicion as much s
anything else which made me determined
to show them that i could be worth my
salt and no man ever worked harder than
i did for nearly two years and then one
evening in june i opened the following
note

my dear jeremy

  if i may say so my brother and  have
been very favourably impressed by the
devotion to duty which you have shown
jor nearly two years at the same time
we cannot lose sight of the fact that
youths a stuff will not endure and we
jeel that this year you should take a con-
siderable holiday since the summer is
as you know the season in which we are
least busy we suggest-and indeed de-
sire-that you should absent yourself jor
the next three months the rest and

  change will do you a deal of good i en-
  close a cheque for six hundred pounds
  which we hope will enable you to take
  some friend away with you and to spend
  a really enjoyable time let us say from
  the first of july to the thirtieth of sep-
  tember

              your affectionate uncle

 to this very handsome treatment i
owe the fact that i have a tale to tell
for that night i made up my mind to

by dornford yates

 i y
wander abroad and a few days later i
purchased a secondhand car this was
a guaranteed lowland-a swift all-
weather two-seater with a huge boot
she proved as good a bargain as ever a
driver made since the car was built to
seat two i did my best to persuade my
friend george laking to bear me com-
pany but he was at work in paris and
could not join me for more than a long
week-end still he said he would meet
me at rouen if i could go by that way
and since i very much wanted to see him
again i made arrangements to ship the
car to dieppe

so it came i drove out of london at five
oclock on a thursday the seventh
day of july taking the road to newhaven
and meaning to cross that night new-
haven-dieppe-rouen where george
was due to meet me the following day

  the afternoon was hot and i took
things easily just after seven i stole
through lewes and on to the newhaven
road and it must have been ten min-
utes later that i saw full in my path a
black coupe ahead by the side of the way
and a girl who was wearing blue trousers

  as i set a foot on the brake she lifted
a hand and when she was sure i was
stopping she stepped to one side i
brought the lowland to rest

  im dreadfully sorry she said but
will you help a damned fool

  where is he i said and made to get
out of the car

  she smiled then-

  dont get out i want a gallon of pet-
rol you see im crossing tonight and
if youve got any petrol they take it out
on the quay so an old hand tries to run
it as fine as ever he can-and fetch up
with a teaspoonful but this time ive
been too clever and now im stuck

  i looked at my petrol-gauge this
showed that more than nine gallons were
still in my tank and newhaven was
three miles off of course i was not an
old hand

  in silence i showed her the gauge and
she covered her mouth

i sighed dyou mean to say they
just take it-and give you nothing at all 
its an old channel custom she said
and then they expect you to tip them
for pumping it out

  as soon as i could speak-

  but we have no pump said i so
though weve nine gallons between us
wed better buy some more we could
drain some of mine into a thermos and

put it into your tank about a dozen times
but it would be a messy job

  she nodded cheerfully without de-
lay too she said if im to be there by
eight

  i let in my clutch i promise i said
to be as quick as i can

  i was as good as my word-for my
sake as much as for hers i wished to
see more of my lady

  she was tall and slim and she moved
and stood very well with her well-cut
slacks she was wearing a white silk shirt
and to keep her hair in place she had
bound a gay handkerchief over her chest-
nut curls wimple and gorget in one this
suited her perfectly but while any face
so framed must have looked its best her
beauty was outstanding

  i was back in acuarter of an hour when
i had poured the spirit into her tank
and had taken the price i had paid be-
cause i dared not refuse she waited for
me to turn round and then drove off be-
fore me-because i know the ropes and
ill lead you on to the quay

half an liour later the cars were tied
to their trays and my remaining pet-
rol had been withdrawn never expect-
ing such bounty they had to senci for
more cans to take it away and since we
could not go aboard for an hour and a
half i asked my lady to dine with me at
the hotel

  she shook her head

  ill eat on the boat she said you
go and have some dinner-unless youd
care for a walk

  yes indeed i said

  i helped her to put on a woolly that
matched her scarf then i put on a jacket
myself and we left the quay

  as we crossed the railway lines-

  my names solan i said and im
trying to be a merchant in crutched
friars

  my companion looked at me that
sounds all wrong she said

  im not sure it isnt said i but
so many better men would be thankful to
have my job

  of course but youre young and
fit and you dont look as if you had
more than one mouth to feed

  i havent said i but-damn it
the job was there a junior partnership
theres nothing the matter with that
there never is-with a mess of pot-
tage she said but you have to pay
for it-esau rank heresy of course
and damned impertinence but thats


your fault trying to be a merchant
got me under the ribs

  may i ask why

  she regarded -the heaven aglow with
the setting sun

  well i think one tries not to be a
merchant if theres nothing for it-
yes but id rather lie out as a shep-
herd than fatten in crutched friars

  am i fat said i

  not yet

  she was leading me into the country
which lay to the north and east and
everything looked so peaceful and seemed
to offer so much that i was quite sorry
i was going abroad

when i told her as much she
nodded

  i know she said i always feel just
the same however my father lives in
france hes-not very strong and i
go to see him a lot and now tell me
where youre going and what youre go-
ing to do

  i told her as much as i knew

  i should go south she said i
shouldnt waste time at rouen but pick
up your man and get on its glorious
down there now-wherever you like to
g south of angouleme

  but he cant stay on said i

  then send him back from bordeaux
and go on alone wander down to the
frontier and then turn east and when
you can smell marseilles turn west by
north

  it was clear that she knew france well
and i led her on to peak of routes and
places and all the things that a wayfarer
ought to know but though she seemed
glad to be with me and talked so natu-
rally she never gave me her name or told
me where she was going or where her
father lived

  dusk had come in before we got back
to the quay and when we had shown
our passports we went aboard and
there we sat down to an excellent simple
meal of cold meat cheese and beer which
suited me better than any elaborate re-
past i gave her a cigarette and took one
myself

  ive three months  i said in which
to improve my mind may i send you a
letter to say how im getting on

  she put up a hand to push back her
shining hair

  i have no address to give you ill be
at bordeaux tomorrow--im joining a
party there but after that-who knows 
ive no idea of their plans

  it was clear that she meant our ac-
quaintance to end at dieppe i had
served her a turn for an evening-be-
cause there was nobody else but i
must not know where to find her or who
she was

  i had not believed she would treat me
like that i would have sworn that she
was above such things  but so
would any fool-who was trying to be a
merchant in crutched frairs

  i laughed shortly perhaps youre
right i said and called for the bill

  when we left the table she led the
way to the deck but though we strolled
i did not feel like speaking and she i
suppose thought it best to leave me alone
it was dark now and we had the place to
ourselves for ours were the only cars
and the boat-train was not yet due time
and place in a word would have fa-
vored the making of love but no man
wants to make love when he has been
kicked in the face

  and then to my great surprise the
girl slid an arm under mine

  try not to hate me esau

  i could never hate you i rejoined

  im glad of that she said quietly
i-i couldnt bear you to hate me im
not as tough as you think
bright boy

  thats all right i said somehow
after all its up to you but youve
done enough damage today to make me
upset to think that im not going to see
you again

  i heard her draw in her breath then
her arm slipped away and she put out a
little hand

  goodnight esau she said im go-
ing to bed sleep well my dear and-
thank you so very much

  wont you give me a name i said
to remember you by

  she looked away over the water sway-
ing black under the stars

  i will-tomorrow she said

  my heart leaped up at that for it
showed that she was rfelenting and might
go further still the following day in-
deed i forgot my resentment which now
seemed unfair to her and after a mo-
ment i put her hand to my lips

  as i kissed her fingers i felt them
close upon mine

  breakfast at eight i said smiling
and dont be late she said gravely
by half-past eight youll have to be off
the ship

  with that she was gone

  as she reached the companion she
turned and the light of some lamp fell
on her face she smiled and lifted a
hand then she turned again and passed
out of my sight

  i suppose i must have been tired for
i slept that night like a log when the
steward called me at seven he brought
me some tea-and there on the tray was
a note to which the man drew my at-
tention because i was half-asleep

  i was to give you this note sir direct-
ly you waked those were the ladys
last words before she went off

  i sat up and stared at the man
went off i said slowly dyou
mean to say that shes gone

thats right sir you can get off if
you like at half-past five she got off
then an her car was cleared before six
i see i said and put a hand to my
head

  youll be taking breakfast sir

  i nodded yes i suppose so i said
ill come in about eight

  very good sir

  the man withdrew and after a little
while i opened the note

  esau dear

    youve made it so very hard for me
  to do the right thing good-by and m
  best of hick always wherever you are

                               katharine

  i remember that the first thing i did
was to look at my watch five minutes
past seven i had to rise and dress and
to clear the car i might i reckoned be
on the road by eight but katharine had
been on the road by six that meant she
had two hours start-on roads that she
knew all the same-

  and there i remembered george lak-
ing george was to meet me at rouen at
half-past two

  i put my letter away and began to
get up   

  it occurred to mu that she had bade me
go south-to send george back from bor-
deaux and go on alone bordeaux that
was where she was going wander down
to the frontier and then turn east a
thousand to one that was what she was
going to do oh of course the thing
was clear and if i slipped down to the
country south of bordeaux and kept an
eye on the road which led to the south
one day i should see a black coupe round-
ing a bend-and a flash of chestnut curls
as it went by

  by eight oclock my appetite had re-
turned


  there was now no need for haste so
i took things easily it was nearly ten
before i ran out of dieppe and past elev-
en before i had come to rouen and found
the hotel at which george and i were to
meet

now if we were to drive to bordeaux
and to waste no time by the way to
take some food in the car seemed the
wisest plan so when i had had a drink i
set about buying provisions from which
we could make a good meal by the side of
the road then i berthed the car and
visited the cathedral and strolled the an-
cient streets until it was time to lunch-
and perceived how wise i had been to
wait for george for one thing only the
fact that i could not speak french would
have been enough to weight me out of the
race but george spoke excellent french

  i finished my lunch by two and took
my seat in the lounge to glance at an
english paper and keep an eye on the
door but i need not have been so zeal-
ous for more than an hour went by but
george never appeared i was out on the
pavement by now because i could not
sit still but i should have done better
to go to the porters desk

  i saw the telegram there at a quarter
past four it had been there since ten
oclock but it had not been given to me
although i had give l my name

  terribly sorry detained till this

  evening coming isy train reaching

  rouen eleven oclock

  i could have shoved the hall-porters
face through the back of his head

  at seven oclock i picked up my food
and beer and stowed them away in the
lowland the idea of further delay sent
me almost out of my mind and yet i
knew it was better than its alternative

  in this winter of discontent i ordered
and later sat down to dinner at eight
oclock but at half-past eight i was once
again walking the streets because to sit
still inactive was more than i could en-
dure

 the night was breathless-more op-
pressive in fact than the day had been
and it must have been ten oclock when
i made up my mind that i must have a
long cold drink before i went down to
the station to meet georges train i
therefore turned my steps toward the
hotel near which the lowland was wait-
ing-had waited most of that day

  i knew the direction to take though
i did not know the way but i had not

far to go and had plenty of time this
was as well for i took a narrow paved
street where the houses were very high
and seemed very old but when after
two or three minutes i came to its end
i found that it was a blind alley or
rather did no more than run into a very
small square

  i was looking round this to be sure
there was no way out when i saw a dis-
creet-looking cafe in one of its sides
there were no tables outside and its
blinds were drawn but a slant of very
good music was stealing out of its doors
and as i stood listening i heard the pop
of a cork

  at once i saw no reason to wait for
my drink and since i was sick of the
sight of the lounge of the hotel i deter-
mined to enter the cafe and then go
straight to the car with that i crossed
the square and walked into the place

  for a moment i thought i had en-
tered a private club for all looked up as
i entered and watched me choose a table
and take my seat but when a waiter
came up he took my order and never
asked my name so i lighted a cigarette
and began to look around

  there was a dancing-floor but the
band was playing tosca and plajdng
it very well-playing very quietly so
that to listen or not was a matter for you
and everyone seemed to speak quietly
no voice was raised there must have
been thirty customers sitting alone or
together-nearly all men but most sur-
prising of all with one or two exceptions
they did not seem to be french

  as they were looking at me i looked
at them english faces i saw and clear
american-to be quite honest some of
them not too good some were well
turned out and some were shabbily
dressed the girls-

  and there i saw katharine-whom i
had supposed to be three hundred and
fifty miles off-sitting staring before her
with a frozen look on her factsl

chapter two

she was sitting sidewise to me with
her back to the wall at a table laid
for three at which dinner was being
served she was wearing a very smart
frock of i think black silk and a small
black hat which suited her lovely hair
on either side of her was seated a man
and when i saw her both men had their
eyes on her fact one had his back to


me but the other i saw very well his
face was large and pale his graying hair
was sandy  the rims of his eyes were
red he had the grimmest mouth that
ever i saw but worse than this was the
sinister light in his eyes these seemed
to be on fire-i can put it no other way
and to see so dreadful a gaze bent upon
katharine released my primitive instincts
as nothing else could have done

how she came to be here i neither
knew nor cared she wjas in trouble
-peril and i was at hand the pricks i
had kicked against had all the time been
goading me up to her side

  i put out my cigarette and walked
across to the table at which she sat

  im awfully glad i said to see you
again

  the man whose back had been toward
me was now looking up into my face
but the eyes of the other man were fast
upon katharine

  very slowly she turned her head then
she looked me up and down

  by god she said slowly i thought
id got rid of you

  her words and her manner of speak-
ing hit me over the heart indeed i
was so much dumfounded that i think
i should have turned and walked out of
the place if the man looking up at me
had not seen fit to laugh

  the snicker made me see red

  i dont think you mean that i said
i think-

  the contents of her champagne-glass
caught me full in the face   

  the man on her right was speaking-
the man with the dreadful eyes his tone
was curiously silky

  why interrupt him formosa  weve
heard what he doesnt think lets hear
what he thinks

  as i wiped the wine from my face-
pray go on my young friend he
drawled im sure in her heart for-
mosa-

  speak for yourself snapped kathar-
ine god knows-

  i know he does flashed the other
and i want to know as well what he
thinks-your nice young man

  the position was intolerable but noth-
ing on earth would have made me leave
katharine now she was playing some
part of course and something was ter-
ribly wrong she was i was sure afraid
of the man on her right

  i addressed myself to her as though she
were sitting alone

confusion broke out and a dozen

  ill go back to my table i said
perhaps later on-

  with that i bowed and turned

  as i passed to the seat i had left i
noticed that the band had stopped play-
ing that everyone in the cafe was sitting
still as death i never felt more self-con-
scious in all my life

  my beer was waiting for me but i was
too shaken to drink instead i took out
cigarettes   

  i saw katharine leave her seat her
underlip caught in her teeth for a mo-
ment i thought she was making for me
and so i think did her companions for
the man on her left started up as though
in pursuit as i rose in my turn he
stopped for instead of coming to me she
turned to an archway which gave to the
ladies room and parting the curtains
which hung there passed out of our view

  i sat down again at once and he re-
turned to his seat slewing himself round
so he could see the curtains through
which my lady must come

  here to my great relief the band be-
gan playing again and i noticed that


men were cursing through the kitchens we ran    down a passage

general movement which always means
that tension has been relaxed

  as i lighted my cigarette i saw a man
making his way to the table which kath-
arine had left though i had seen no
sign given he had been clearly sum-
moned by the man who had sat on her
right for he stood by his side as a serv-
ant who has been sent for and now
awaits the order which he expects to re-
ceive the other spoke over his shoul-
der  and since as soon as he spoke his
myrmidon looked at me there could be
no doubt at all that i was the object of
his instructions

  that this made me feel uneasy i must
most frankly confess for the fellow was
heavily built and looked a criminal
however there was nothing to be done
and i watched him leave his master and
pass to a seat by the side of the entrance-
doors as he went by i saw a girl
glance at her neighbor and purse her lips

   think every eye in that cafe was
watching the curtains which shrouded
the ladies room sooner or later kath-
arine was bound to come out and with

her coming something was going to hap-
pen-and something big in a word the
scene was set for a first-class row

  i began to wish very much that i was
not alone i know how to use my hands
and i am a powerful man but i had the
definite feeling that everyone there was
against me because they dared not of-
fend the man with the dreadful eyes
and i would have been glad of someone
to set his back against mine

  and something else i wished this
was that the little square to which the
cafe belonged was not at the very end of
a long ill-lighted and lonely cul-de-sac

  and then without any warning the
whole of the lights went out

i shall never forget that moment
the valse which the band was mur-
muring died a discordant death a girl
cried out my god  and a general rus-
tle suggested that all were up on their
feet

  i know i was up on mine for i at
once assumed that this had been done
on purpose to give my friends a chance


of coming to grips with me before i
could see they were there and i was
just going to move to try and get my
back to the wall when i felt a hand
close on my wrist and katharine
breathed in my ear

 come

  i could not think how she could see
for i was blind but she hauled me rather
than led me across the dancing-floor and
behind the bar

as we went confusion broke out i
 heard an ice-pail go crashing and
somebody tripped and fell this might
have been the signal for uproar for
chairs began to go over and oaths to
rise and a pile of metal dishes slid on-
to the floor as their hideous racket
subsided a girl cried out again and a
dozen men were cursing and calling for
lights and a voice that i knew was
blaring close the doors

  as we rounded some screen the pal-
lid beam of a torch leaped out of the
dark behind

  we were in a passage now and a wait-
er collided with katharine and drove her
back on to me at once he began to
abuse her but she thrust on the fel-
low sought to detain her-without suc-
cess for i hit him under the jaw and i
heard him fall through the kitchens
we went where a scullion was lighting
a candle and a chef his back toward us
was raving like a madman over the
fate of some dish so down another pas-
sage and into a broad courtyard at the
end of which a shaft of light from some
lamp which i could not see was shining
onto the cobbles silhouetting some man

  we came to gigantic doors which were
keeping a porte-cochere in these a wicket
was open and a negro in uniform was
speaking with someone outside as we
came up he turned but before he could
close the wicket i hurled him aside and
katharine stumbled out with me on her
heels

  somebody shouted behind us and the
negro gave tongue in reply but we were
out in a street-a street that i knew

  there was next to no one about and
i saw no policeman but the lowland
was standing silent some sixty yards off

  i put my arm under katharines and
ran her up to its door

  inside i panted and as i flung in
behind her where shall i go 

 anywhere quick straight on
youve no time to turn

  this was the truth

  as i fitted the key to the switch i
saw a man running toward us and two
or three standing by the wicket through
which we had come

  to go straight ahead was to meet him
and pass by them but because the devil
was driving we had no choice if only
the car had been facing the opposite
way-

  my faithful engine started like any
highwaymans mare but the man was
but five paces off when i let in my clutch
i recognized him as the tough with the
criminal face

  as he sprang for the running-board i
put down my foot   

  he had of course aimed for the door
but because the lowland leaped forward
he met the side of the boot and the off
hind wheel-a very disagreeable encoun-
ter to judge from the bump on the car
and the screech which he gave

  i changed into second-third

  as we tore past the wicket the light
fell full on a big pale face it might
have been a mask the eyes of which were
lighted by some supernatural means

  which way now i breathed

  straight on for the moment ill tell
you put on your lights i did as she
said turn to the left at the bottom
and then go straight

  we streaked down the empty street
and swung to the left i remember i
heard some clock chiming and saw the
masts of ships standing up on my right

  let her right out breathed kath-
arine theyve got a racing merk
and judas has gone to get it i saw him
go

  although her voice was steady the
flood of light from an arc-lamp showed
me the fear in her face this was turned
toward me pier eyes were fast on the
window in the back of the hood

  judas be damned  said i he
hasnt a hope

  but i did not like the sound of the
words a racing merk

we flashed the length of the quay
then by her direction bore to the
right fell down a cobbled cutting and
whipped up a broad highway bend was
succeeding bend but the lowland knew
how to sit down and i never lifted my
foot

  left in a minute said katharine
and up a steep hill we must get over
the river before we play any tricks

  are you sure we hadnt better turn
off-and let them go by
 no no i-ive heard them talk-
 ing i know im right

 the hill was serpentine and i lost
 time badly there because it was dark
 and i did not know the road and then
 we were out on some uplands and i was
 able again to give the lowland her head

 with the needle pointing to eighty we
 dived at a long decline  

 at last i slowed for a bend

 quick said katharine i see the
 glow of their lights

 i bit my lip

 where is this damned river said i

 not very far now but we must be
 over the bridge before they come on

 the mile or so that followed i can-
 not remember    poplars i think
 and some houses but i cannot be sure
 my brain was not recording i drove
 instinctively all my wits were focused
 on whether or not the next bend was
 masking the bridge

 are they coming up i breathed

 i-cant be sure

 from that i knew that they were and
 i set my teeth

 and then i saw the bridge coming-
 and saw its length

 god almighty i groaned-and put
 down my foot

all you know said katharine
theyre-not very far

 as we left the road for the bridge she
 spoke again

 youre coming slap into a town cob-
 bles bear right and stand by to brake
 and to put out your lights ill tell you
 when to do it were going to turn off

 off the bridge and into a cobbled
 street

 as i lifted the lowland up for a sharp
 ascent she said brake at the top of
 this and turn sharp to the right

 my lights

 put them out when youve seen the
 turning

 with her words it came into view-a
 turn and a half i put out my lights
 and took it-on two wheels

 and now switch off

 as i switched the engine off i heard
 the wasplike note of the racing car

 i heard her leave the bridge and the
 hum turn into a snarl as she leaped at
 the cobbled street the snarl swelled in-
 to a roar    and then she bore to the
 left and the snarl slid into a mutter
 and she was gone

 i turned to katharine but she was
 still listening intently straining her ears

 i began to listen too to hear what i
 could

 suddenly out of the silence i heard
 the mutter flare up-for an instant

 i saw katharine nod her head

 thats right she said theyre tak-
 ing the evreux road

 there was a little silence

 and we my dear said i which
 road do we take 

 god knows said katharine

 she clapped her hands to her face and
 burst into tears

 i did not speak i put my arm about
 her and held her close but it wrung my
 heart to see her in such distress

 after a little however she drew away
 from me and lifted her head

the fellow sought to
detain her-without
sucecss for i hit him
under the jaw
the blue book magazine

   theres something she said theres
 something the matter with me never
 mind weve got to get on get her go-
 ing again ill tell you the way to go
 as i switched the engine on i glanced
 at the clock in the dash to see that this
 had stopped at twenty minutes to eleven
 oclock but when i looked at my wrist-
 watch this said the same and then i
 realized that the clock in the dash had
 not stopped-that it was but thirty-five
 minutes since i had walked into the cafe
 that stood in the little square

 digesting this startling truth i let
 in my clutch

   except that she took me south i do
 not know where we went but i drove as
 hard as i could for over two hundred
 miles two or three times we stopped
 but never for more than five minutes to
 stretch our legs and we had no need of
 petrol because my tank had been full

   in all this distance we hardly spoke
 at all because i think what had to be
 said was too much to be said whilst we
 were driving at such a speed besides
 we were fugitives-not from justice of
 course but from something that knew no
 law at least that was how i saw it

   i have said that the night was warm
 after some twenty miles we lowered the
 hood and i well remember how very
 pleasant was the cool sweet air as the
 lowland sailed on in the way of a bird

   what astonished me very much was
 katharines quiet assurance as to the
 way we should go she never asked for
 a map and she led me through town aft-
 er town with hardly a check and then
 as the dawn came up she told me to
 slacken speed

   theres a place near here she said
where ive stopped before i think i
shall know the turning-its just before
i or just after a tumbledown house

   on the left or right said i

   on the left    there it is and
 theres the old house beyond

   i braked and swung to the left and
 after another two miles we came to a
 long stone bridge

   over this said katharine and
 two hundred yards farther on youll find
 a track on your right youll have to
 go carefully there i think you should
 put her in first

   the track was pretty steep and its
 surface was bad but it just accepted
 the lowland and that was as much as i
 asked almost at once it began to curl
 round to the right until i saw that we

were running down to the bank of the
river which we had crossed a moment
before

  a moment later the sides of the track
fell away and there we were on a decent
patch of greensward with room to turn
and trees growing thick about us and
ten or twelve paces away the bank of the
river itself my headlights showed me
the water flowing deep and steady but
making no sound at all

  i brought the lowland to rest then
i switched off her engine and put out her
lights and though it was dark where we
were i could see the heaven above now
pale with light and the woods across the
water were taking shape

  katharine left the car and i followed
her out

  we shant be disturbed here she
said if only wed got some food-
theres enough for six said i in
the lowlands boot

  she let out a sigh of relief

  thats luck and to spare she said
you havent by any chance got any-
thing hot 

  im afraid i havent i said but i
think a glass of brandy would do you
good	

  if youll give me a little she said
i think it would

  i found my flask and poured a tot of
brandy into its cup

  drink that down t said and ill
give you a coat

its just the dawn she said ill
be all right as soon as the sun gets up
but i made her put on a big coat that
i had in the car then i gave her a ciga-
rette and began to get out the food

  t was a curious breakfast

   the sward was wet with dew and so
she sat in the car a suitcase for a table
set up in the drivers seat smoked salm-
on and bread and butter and pate and
galantine-i served them as best i could
using the step as a sideboard and thank-
ful to see her eat for drink we had
only beer but she drank a glass of that

  at length she slid out of the car and
onto the sward

  ive done but you havent she said
could you possibly lend me a sponge
and soap and a brush and comb if
you could ill go down to the water and
do my best

  i was glad to do as she asked for
only three days before i had bought
myself a new outfit of toilet requisites
but as she went off with these things
when the devil drives

and a cashmere scarf which i had to
serve as a towel i could not help think-
ing how miserable she must be-dressed
up in a party frock in which she had
spent the night yet quite unable to
change so much as her stockings-be-
cause of course she had nothing else to
put on

  and there it occurred to me that i
had some new gray trousers and plenty
of sleeveless shirts

by the time she was back i had a
change of raiment laid out on a rug
-with a bath-dressing-gown and a new
toothbrush out of my store of spares

  i heard her cry of delight as they met
her eyes

 oh esau how marvelous are
these things really for me

  i thought said i you might be
glad of a change

  she stared at the clumsy apparel fin-
ger to lip

  ill tell you what  she said not
now but a little later ill have a bathe
and then what joy-to be able to put
on clean things

  a bathe said i would suit me
down to the socks

  but not for an hour youve just
been eating wash your face and hands
-and shave if you feel that way but
dont be long

  i was back in a quarter of an hour
and as i parted the bushes i saw her
before she saw me

  the cushions were out of the car on
the farther edge of the sward because
of the rising woods the sunshine was not
yet falling upon the grass byt because
she was higher up her head and shoul-
ders were bathed in the blessed light
she was sitting staring before her with
her knees drawn up and her fingers laced
about them-and as desperate a look on
her face as ever i saw she looked neither
tired nor afraid but her beauty was
tragic

  not knowing what else to do i stole
a few paces back then i advanced
noisily  as again i parted the bushes
i saw to my relief that the look was
out of her face and as i advanced she
met my gaze gravely then set a hand on
the cushion that lay by her side

  let me get a pipe said i and
youd like a cigarette 

  very well

  a moment later i took my seat beside
her glad of the sun then i lighted her
cigarette and unfolded my pouch

    you dont look tired i said and
  yet you should be all in

    sq should you said katharine
  -driving all night

    for some reason im not i imag-
  ine that later on well both be glad of a
  rest

    i expect so and we can have it i
  dont want to leave here till dusk she
  regarded the palms of her hands and
  now if you please lets tell one another
  the truth the air has got to be cleared
  so wed better do it at once im not
  going to keep anything back-its too
  late now and im not going to throw
  any stones for the fault was mine i
  should never have sent you that note
  how in gods name did you manage
  to run me to earth i mean i had
  gone to ground before you were called
  i told her all that had happened the
  day before how the one idea i had had
  had been to get to bordeaux and to find
  her there how george and the porter
  between them had let me down how i
  had arranged to leave rouen as soon as
  ever george came and how the merest
  chance had taken me into the caf in
  which she was

    i was killing time i concluded i
  meant to drive all night to get down to
  bordeaux but georges train wasnt
  due till eleven oclock and so i was
  walking the streets because i couldnt
  sit still then i landed up in that square
  from which i couldnt get out and see-
  ing a cafe there i decided to have a
  drink before retracing my steps i never
  saw you at first but when i did i could
  hardly believe my eyes

athartne sighed

i wish you hadnt she said and
  ill tell you another thing that you
  should have entered that cafe means that
  your guardian angel-well he wasnt
  earning his keep

    to be honest i said i thought
  that some of the customers looked a bit
  queer but it seemed all right from out-
  side in fact better than most

    now and again said katharine a
  non-member does blow in it doesnt
  often happen the wet flags not in the
  books and its off the beaten track but
  it has been known to happen and un-
  less he is answered for unless some
  member can say that he is all right-
  well i dont know what happens to him
  but he never comes back

     member  said i staring then
mv first impression was right it is a

club of sorts-this place that you call
the wet flag

  katharine raised her eyebrows
yes she said it is it is a club
of sorts in fact its a thieves kitchen
-to use the traditional term and i
am a member-because you see im a
crook

chapter three

i have taken some knocks in my
time but this revelation of katha-
rines so bluntly and casually made ac-
tually set my ears singing--and that is
the downright truth  i began to review



the facts grisly or no they simply had
to be faced this glorious well-bred
creature belonged to the criminal class
my most attractive companion of whom
i had been so proud was nothing more
or less than a common thief katharine
was formosa-the girl whose hand i had
kissed who had left behind her that
tender pitiful note

  youve made it so very hard jor me
to do the right thing

  it was the thought of that sentence
that brought me up all standing dis-
persed the facts i was facing and showed
me instead two definite flaming truths
the first was this though she gave
herself that name she was not by nature
a crook and the second-that i was in
love with one of the criminal class
takes getting hold of doesnt it

  i looked up to meet her gray eyes

  it would said i if it happened to
be the truth

  its true enough-and you know it
let me put it like this said i my
eyes upon hers for some reason or
other you may have done as crooks do
but that doesnt make you a crook
nothing on earth my dear could ever
do that 

  she was looking down and away
thats-very handsome she said
but you cant get round it like that
im not getting round it said i i
dont care who youve run with or what
youve done everyone there was a
crook-i can see it now but you are
not of that kidney and never were
that means that you had good reason
for mucking in with that crowd what
that reason was i neither know nor care
you had good reason-and that is
enough for me



yes she said its a thieves
kitchen and i am a member-
because yon see i am a crook
the blue book magazine

  in fact you believe in-formosa
her head was still turned away and
she spoke very low

  with all my heart i said gently i
may not know my world but ive seen
the light in your eyes

  there was a little silence then-
ive never stolen said katharine
i only carry the stuff thats just as
bad of course its no good stealing a
thing if you cant get it safely away
but in fact i have never stolen and
nine times out of ten i never set eyes on
a jewel im not excusing myself by
rights i should be in jail but-since
you believe in formosa id like you to
hear her side for what it is worth no
one has ever heard it and no one but
you ever will and no one but you
would believe it-its just a shade too
fantastic for people who know their
world

id love to hear it i said but dont
jl think that ive got to i know your
hands are clean and i dont have to have
any proof

  katharine looked at me

  youre very sweet esau she said
ill make it as short as i can

  my fathers an artist-a painter at
least he was if he had cared to paint
portraits i think hed have made a big
name but he had a private income and
so he wouldnt bother but painted what-
ever he pleased he had a rare eye for
beauty and all things fair he never
could bear ostentation of any kind but
simple natural things were the breath of
his life anything sordid or vulgar
caused him genuine distress and i want
you to understand that this wasnt a
pose he was-and is-unusually sensi-
tive

  well he served right through the
war and as you may well imagine it
left its mark on his soul what left a
still deeper mark was my mothers
death she died in  when i was
born bruised and broken-hearted for
my sake he held up his head but the
ways of the post-war world were more
than he could endure and so he began
to wander in search of some corner in
europe which had been spared he
found it in  when i was twelve and
he came straight back to england to
fetch me and take me out so that i
could share with him his great discovery

  cardinal is a little hamlet right in
the heart of france its really very
lovely set on the banks of a river and

  sunk in magnificent woods its people
  are very simple arid quite unspoiled
  and they live and work as they used to
  in bygone days but cardinals pride is
  its castle a little pocket chateau hung
  high above the village in the fifteenth
  century by someone who knew how to
  build it was for sale and my father
  bought it at once and then he set to
  work to restore it

    he and the village masons did all
  the work it took five years to do and
  i saw it done and when it was finished
  it was the most perfect thing its like
  a lovely little fairy castle and it faces
  south and it sleeps in the sun all day
  and below it the water-wheels are run-
  ning and the smoke from a score of
  chimneys lies like a veil in the treetops
  because the air is so still

    well as ive told you it took five
  years to do and when cardinal was
  once again perfect in every way my fa-
  ther went blind one day he could see
  and the next he had lost his sight and
  that irreparably

    he took it wonderfully im sorry
  hed say but it might be so very much
  worse im here at cardinal and i
  know its beauty by heart ill be happy
  here with the speech of the birds abofit
  me and the lisp of the wind in the trees
  the servants were very faithful-
  weve only four and as i was careful to
  see that everything went the same he
  really survived very well this great ca-
  tastrophe he knew the castle so well
  that soon he could move about as he did
  before his clothes were laid out as al-
  ways  the meals were served as usual
  with conrad-thats the butler-stand-
  ing behind his chair  and after six weeks
  esau if you had dined there with us i
  honestly do not believe that you would
  have known he was blind

  out one thing he could not do that
  lj was business his correspondence
  was small but he couldnt sign cheques
  or write letters and things like that
  not that it mattered because i took all
  that on i was seventeen then and
  though i knew nothing before i very
  soon picked things up

    there wasnt much to pick up what
  savings he had had gone on cardinal 
  but he couldnt touch his income for
  that was settled on me it was fifteen
  hundred a year-and more than enough
  for cardinal only costs a thousand a year
  to run so as i say i soon got the hang
  of things    and then on my eight-
  
when the devil drives

eenth birthday i opened a note from his
bank it was very politely worded but
very firm no more cheques could be
honored until my fathers account was
in credit again this shook me up for
i knew that we werent overdrawn but
there i was wrong we were for no in-
come had been paid in for nearly six
months

hpo cut a long story short the money
 was gone  a trust company had
crashed and we had nothing at all-ex-
cept an overdraft of two hundred and
fifty pounds

  i never told my father-he doesnt
know to this day but i had a pretty
bad time for the next few days the
thought of his leaving cardinal was
something i could not face and yet i
had to face something far worse than
that-a blind man lodged in some alley
where rooms were cheap while his
daughter tried to earn money to buy
them bread deprived of all he set store
by my father must surely die or go out
of his mind

  well i managed to cover up some-
how for twenty-four hours and then i
left for london to sell my jewels they
hd been my mothers of course and i
worked out that theyd make twelve
hundred pounds that would pay off
the overdraft and carry cardinal on for
the better part of a year

  and then a strange thing happened
we had a fearful crossing-the chan-
nel was at its worst and one poor wom-
an on board was terribly ill to make
matters worse she had a little girl with
her and though the scrap wasnt ill she
was frightened to death i happen to be
a good sailor and so i took charge of
the child the mother couldnt thank
me enough and all she wanted to do was
to prove her gratitude and then on the
way to london she used these words

   i know my place and its no good
asking you out but ill tell you what
my dear-if ever you want a fine brooch
or a bracelet or diamond ring never you
go to bond street you write to me
my husbands in hatton carden and
when he knows what youve done hell
get you whatever you want and let you
have it at cost

  well that was good enough there
and then i told her that i had come to
london on purpose to sell my jewels
and that if she meant what she said
here was her chance to help me to do a
good deal to say she jumped at it



means nothing at all her husband was
at victoria and before i left the plat-
form id arranged to be at his office at
noon the following day

  i went-to get the shock of my life
he examined the jewels with the greatest
possible care then he said he would try
to get me six hundred and twenty-two
pounds

  he proved his case all right he
showed me other gems and then turned
them up in his books and showed me
the prices hed paid but that didnt
temper  the wind it only satisfied me
that i was up against it far more than
id dreamed and what with all id
been through this unexpected punch
put me down and out i fainted prop-
erly and when i came to i was lying
flat on a sofa and he and another man
were bathing my temples and wrists

  who the other man was i had no
idea but i took him to be some mag-
nate for he was issuing orders and tak-
ing charge and my friend-mr cohen
-was fairly twittering then the man
sent cohen off for brandy and when co-
hen was gone he asked what my trouble
might be

  i told him some of the truth-be-
cause i wasnt myself but i had had no
one to talk to and he was a business
man i didnt like his looks but-any
port in a storm he might be able to
help me-you never knew

-vell he listened carefully then

  w he asked me where i was staying
how long i should be there then cohen
came back with the brandy and soon
after thatt cleared out two days went
by and then i received a note it was
from the magnate all right and he said
if id come and see him he had a sug-
gestion to make hatton garden again
but a different house i went and he
made his suggestion two thousand a
year and expenses if i would do as he
wished smuggling he called it for
nearly three months i really believed it
was and then one day i found that it
wasnt smuggling

  my impulse was to go to the police
and i wish to god i had but you see
my hands were not clean and i dreaded
the awful exposure which must result if
i did so i went to-my employer in-
stead i told him what he was fit for
and pitched the stuff down at his feet
and then i walked out

  i didnt get very far that night i
was in a cabin on board a ship in the
satan

stream the door was locked and i
couldnt open the porthole and i didnt
like the look of the negro who came when
i rang the bell he-my employer-
came to see me an hour before the ship
sailed he said i could take my choice
carry on as before or sail for buenos
aires to take on a--a different job

  and so i went back

i trted again later on by that time
 i was afraid to go to the police i was
involved too deeply-hed seen to that
and so i just disappeared and after
lying low for ten days i ventured to
cardinal

  a letter was waiting for me there

  till then i had never dreamed that
he knew my true name and address for
id taken my mothers name and id al-
ways been so careful to cover my tracks
but he knows-everything

  the letter was very short it simply
said that if i did not return he was
coming to cardinal  must make your
fathers acquaintance in a sense he is
my protege i have kept cardinal going
for more than a year and ivhen he
knows this-

    well-needs must when the devil
  drives i couldnt face torture like that
  and so once more i went back

    she put her hands to her temples and
  pushed back her shining hair

    and that was how i learned what i
  might have perceived before-that hav-
  ing begun i had simply got to go on
  when i reported for duty he rammed
  that home dont do it again he said
  lest a worse thing befall youre worth
  the trouble youve given-but not any
  more i realized then that id never be
  permitted to clear because i knew too
  much you see i know a great deal-
  that shouldnt be known i know the
  thieves and receivers i know the big
  men and small i know their habits and
  customs and where they are to be found
  i know how the police are outwitted and
  see the mistakes they make when a
  crimes done i can tell you who planned
  it as well as who carried it out-because
  i am in on these things    and once
  you are in on those things youve got
  to go on or go under-theres no other
  way

   what dyou mean-go under i
  said

    katharin shrugged and picked up a
  cigarette	

    lose your life she said slowly i
  cant put it plainer than that twice
  my life has been spared because-well
  because it was worth it you see im
  valuable because of my birth and my
  breeding i am above suspicion and i
  can go anywhere for that reason too
  hes always played straight with me
  but now hes through i know it hes
  got a good many faults but he never
  threatens twice

    there was another silence-a much
  longer one than before her cigarette
  was half smoked before i spoke

    im afraid ive torn it i said

    fate has torn it said katharine it
  wasnt your fault

    the point is-its torn said t
    katharine gave a short nod

    yes she said its torn when you
  walked up to my table the veil of the
  temple was rent she threw down her
  cigarette and covered her eyes when
  i saw you come in i was graveled-i
  couldnt think what to do i knew you
  were bound to see me and once youd
  seen me i ktew you were bound to come
  up and that was of course what hap-
  pened

    i hardly know what i said but i
tried to force you-to blast yog out of

that room if youd turned on your
heel and gone i think theyd have let
you go but when you stood your
ground-well that was about as good as
walking onto the drop you would have
been-er-rendered unconscious then
dropped into the seine

  well something had to be done the
door was hopeless of course but i knew
the back way out most of us know it
-in case but its not allowed to be used
i mean thats understood the ques-
tion was how to make it and take you
too and then i thought of the switch-
board i knew that was fixed in a cup-
board inside the ladies room well
that was all right but i had to be able
to see whilst everyone else was blind
so i shut my eyes for two minutes then
i put up my hand and pulled the main
switch down then i shut and locked the
cupboard and took the key and then i
got hold of you and you know the rest
you saved my life i said

  perhaps but what else could i do
if you had been placed as i was you
couldnt have let me go down

 and as a result youre-wanted 

katharine gave her short nod
were both wanted  she said
ttie shepherd wants us-thats the man
with the eyes and-its no good not
facing facts-he usually gets what he
wants

  does he indeed  said i-and felt as
ripe for murder as ever i did in my life
was he the swine who engaged you
three years ago when you were right
up against it and ready to sell your
soul

  yes it was he

  i sucked in my breath

  its as well for us both said i that
i didnt know that last night never
mind some other time if he tries as
hard as you say we shall probably
meet

  katharine caught my arm

  my dear youre out of your mind
youve about as much chance with the
shepherd as a baby would have with a
tiger whod lost his kill

  i know i said im not going after
him i dont believe in throwing ones
life away but if somebodys after you
-well the time may come when it suits
you to let him come up

  im afraid i cant see that time com-
ing i know the shepherd-and his men
bright boy and satan-too well

  i rose to my feet and stretched

  and i actually thought i said smil-
ing that i had torn things 

  katharine stared up at me

  what has happened to change your
mind

  reflection i said nothing else
upon reflection i see that ive done you
a very good turn i think your mess of
pottage has cost you enough

  i drew her up to her feet and looked
into her eyes

  im sorry my lady i said but you
shouldnt have sent me that note
dont be a fool t was trying to
temper the wind

  thats all im doing said i lets
leave it at that

twelve lazy hours had gone by we
had bathed and slept and katha-
rine was wearing my clothes which be-
cause they were far too big made her
look like a beautiful child for the time
she went barefoot because she was sick
of her shoes and there of course my
wardrobe had broken down

  the change and the rest had refreshed
her and as she sat by my side on the
sunlit sward propping herself on one
arm and considering one of my maps i
found it hard to believe that this was
indeed formosa who had flouted the po-
lice of europe for three long years

  after a while she looked up

  listen esau she said weve had
a nice quiet day and if things were what
they look like wed pack up our traps
and go to some good hotel but things
arent what they look like and though
you maynt believe it were in a hell of
a jam for the moment were off the
map but weve got to stay off the map
for some considerable time for at least
a month theyll ransack france for us
both and its no good our clearing out
for theyll watch the ports the shep-
herd has wires he can pull all over the
place and the wet flags like an ex-
change last night the news went out
that formosa had cut and run and what
is much more to the point that the shep-
herd would like her back and as the
shepherds worth pleasing that means
that petty crooks all over the place will
keep an eye cocked for formosa and if
they should see her go by will try and
follow her up

  i think that i must have shown the
surprise i felt for i heard her sigh and
a hand went up to her head

  esau dear get this however absurd
it seems you must accept as gospel
the lius book magazine

whatever i tell you for one thing only-
law-abiding people have no conception
at all of the way in which news goes
round in the underworld rumor per-
haps but the rumor is always right
nothing is ever written so far as i
know but no system of information is
half as quick or as good the things
they know about people would startle
you out of your life after all its a
secret service and the better the service
is the more money it makes

and now lets get back to the point-
which is that our lives depend on
our not being found well we obviously
cant stay here weve got to have food
and shelter and ive got to have some
clothes in a word weve got to start
fair and that is why tonight we must
make for cardinal

  but wont that be asking for trouble
i mean-

  i think hell try elsewhere first only
last night he told me a way to pass into
spain and i think hes now going all
out to stop that gap i may be wrong
but i think he will make up his mind
that cardinal is the one place i shall
avoid if im right that will give us a
breather no more than that of course 
for when hes drawn blank elsewhere
hes certain to go to my home but be-
fore then we shall be gone i can warn
the servants against him and cardinals
half a fort but i dont think hell trou-
ble my father-hes past blackmail

  it may have been a mistake to rest
today but ask too much of the flesh
and the spirit will let you down and
id very much rather travel by night
than day besides to tell you the truth
when we got here this morning i didnt
know where to turn its only during
the day that ive managed to work
things out

  well from here to cardinal is three
hundred and fifty miles on the roads
we are going to take youll have to drive
very well to average thirty-five and that
works out at over ten hours-which
means if we leave at dusk that we ought
to be in by six i shant like the last
two hours but it cant be helped and
as i said just now i think hell rule car-
dinal out for two or three days

  im in your hands said i but
well have to take in petrol-twice im
afraid

  she bit her lip

  im sorry for that tonight doesnt
matter at all but tomorrow morning

does it means waking somebody up
and when you dont want to be noticed
thats not the way to behave still
thats a drop in the bucket-of this ap-
palling stew she put her hands to her
eyes im afraid to look at the future
because if i did i believe i should
throw in my hand havocs ahead all
right and i cant see any way through
but the obvious thing to do is to try and
hang on to our lives-if only because
when were dead we cant do anything
more

  with that she turned again to the
map and left me staring before me re-
garding the efforts of a beetle to find a
way off the blade of grass he had
climbed without turning back

  sitting there in that peaceful place
it was very hard to believe that we were
in peril let alone danger of death and
when i remembered the office in
crutched friars my pleasant window-
boxed chambers in savile row the
cheerful london traffic and all that went
to make up the safe untroubled exist-
ence which i had so lately led i was
almost prepared to wake up and find
myself sitting at rouen still waiting for
georges train

  think i may be forgiven

  i had read of crime in the papers i
had never been into a police-court had
never seen an arrest i had always sup-
posed that pickpockets apart unless you
had great possessions no rogue on earth
could be bothered to look at you twice
and i had firmly believed that no crook
ever did murder unless he had his back
to the wall i had heard of the under-
world  and it meant no more to me than
the urban district council of zanzibar

   and now i was wanted by one of
its leading men-the dent on the low-
lands boot left no doubt about that
and because his writ ran in europe i
must not drive by daylight over the
roads of france because i had encoun-
tered formosa i was to be put to death

  a gust of anger swept me who was
this filthy sewer-rat to raise his hand
against me who was this beast to pur-
sue me because i had dared to raise my
eyes to his prey his prey a lady of
high degree-of whom he had taken ad-
vantage when she was down and out
he called it smuggling and when
she had tried to withdraw he had made
ready to ship her beautiful body for
buenos aires  i felt the sweat break
upon my forehead as i pictured the
when the devil drives

stuffy cabin and the shepherd dictating
his terms and then-blackmail a
threat to break her father to smash the
life for which she had sold her soul
and so i went back because he said
so she must go on or go under for
her no hope nothing but running the
gantlet risking her name and her free-
dom to carry his stolen goods    the
thing was intolerable if scotland
yard- and then i saw that i could
not call on the police  for katharine was
formosa and anyone in touch with for-
mosa would be just a shade too welcome
at scotland yard

t tave you got things straighter
  i  said katharine

  i looked up to see her watching me
finger to lip

  yes i said boldly i have but im
still a bit out of my depth so i look to
you its very kind of you to ask me
to cardinal ill love to meet your fa-
ther and stay with you at your home
how we get there is of course a matter
for you but it seems to me a scandalous
thing that in this year of grace you and
i should go in fear of our lives because
your late employer disapproves of our
acquaintance that sort of thing makes
m feel that the shepherds death and
burial are overdue i mean the man
seems to me to have outlived his useful-
ness

  there are many quarters said
katharine in which that sentiment
would be greeted with prolonged ap-
plause-provided of course that the
shepherd was out of earshot but when
encouraged by this you called for re-
cruits youd find that all your support-
ers had something much better to do

  that i can well believe of such is
the kingdom of hell and as a result
we have got to bow to the storm we
must of course-for the moment and
when were at cardinal well talk about
him again

  do you realize now why he wants to
find you so much 

  i shrugged because i suppose i
said i wandered behind the scenes

  let me give you his point of view
esau you followed me to the wet flag
you saw with half an eye that i was
keeping-well doubtful company you
determined to stand your ground and to
get to the bottom of this he there-
fore tried and failed to-shall we say
shut your mouth result you are at
large and so at liberty if ever you see

him again to point him out to the police
and demand his arrest add to all this
that formosa has thrown in her lot with
you and you must be able to see that
from his point of view his mental and
physical health depend upon your being
found and silenced as soon as possible
well its nice to think hes worried
said i

  you may said katharine be per-
fectly sure of that you see hes a pret-
ty big man he has a beautiful flat in
town  and i dont think youd believe me
if i told you the name of his club

  i had driven for nearly eight hours
and we had covered two hundred and
thirty odd miles the roads had been
tricky and some of them none too good
but it was the level crossings that
spoiled our time how many we met i
forget but seven of these had been shut
had it been day this would have been
bad enough but in nearly every case the
keeper was fast asleep and had to be
roused of course if one goes across
country at dead of night one must i
suppose expect to be badly served but
the waste of time was enough to break
anyones heart i would have been
thankful myself to open and close the
gates but though i tried more than once
they were always locked

 and now the dawn was coming-the
east was pale and we had still to cover
one hundred and seventeen miles

the strain had told on us for we could
not lose sight of the fact that we
might be driving straight into the en-
emys arms and in any event we were
heading for dangerous country where
neither could tell what a bend in the
road might conceal then again the de-
lays at the crossings had sickened our
hearts had made us feel that the stars
were fighting against us holding us up to
serve the enemys turn

  it was just a quarter to five when i
put out my lights but i did not put
out the hooded light on the dash it
was no good not facing facts the petrol-
gauge was a telltale i had to watch and
when i remembered the petrol which
had been pumped out of my tank on a
certain summer evening a lifetime ago
i could not help feeling that fortune
must have her tongue in her cheek

  so for another ten miles while the
country about us unveiled and distance
took shape and a crag on the left stood
up like a mourning hatchment against
the glow of the dawn


  at last i could bear it no longer and
clsargg my throat

  my dear i said im sorry but
very sobn weve got to take petrol in
i heard her catch her breath and saw
her eyes leap to the dash

  then- how much does that say
just over a gallon said i less
than twenty miles

  she bit her lip that means the
next pump she said and a hundred
to one the fellow will be in bed hell
never forget the people who had him up
and out at a quarter past five

  he neednt see both said i you
can walk on out of sight before i knock
at the door

  thats too easy said katharine i
think perhaps wed better make for a
town she picked up a map i think
were close to volet there may be an all-
night garage and anyway therell be
any number of pumps its the lonely
petrol-station that lets the fugitive
down

  volet was twelve miles off and eight-
een minutes later we entered upon its
cobbled streets

 for two or three minutes we picked
our way through the town moving very
slowly and peering to right and to left
down ways which we passed then our
street curved into a place in which stood
a decent hotel by the side of this hotel
stood its garage and the doors of the
garage were open though those of the
hotel were shut what was still more
to the point in the jaws of the garage
entrance some car was being fueled-
from a pump which was inside fhe gar-
age and out of our sight

  the luck that changed said katha-
rine who but a guest would use a ho-
tel garage to fill his tank 

  the back of the car was toward us
and as i brought the lowland to rest on
the opposite side of the way a man in
clogs appeared to play with the pipe for
a moment and then lift it clear of the
tank and screw the cap back into place
then he reentered the garage to hang
up the pipe a moment or two elapsed
during which no doubt some payment
was being made then he appeared again
to watch the car into the road as its
driver moved slowly backward he waved
him on with his hand

  i let the other get clear then i
swung over the road over the pavement
afid into the garage itself

  as i stopped where the other had
stood the man in clogs cartie shambling

up to the door but when i asked for
petrol he only stared for petrole is
not petrol but paraffin of such is the
curse of babel    and katharine had
to lean forward and put me right

  for obvious reasons i did not get oiit
of the car but i watched the petrol-
gauge and i took my note-case out

  after a frantic calculation- how
much shall i give him i whispered

  katharine made no answer and when
i looked at her i saw there was some-
thing wrong

  she was white as a sheet she did not
seem to be breathing her eyes were shut

  good god i said whats wrong

  she did not speak but i saw her open
her eyes and look to the left

  i followed her gaze

  a glare of lamps was lighting the con-
crete sink upon which a car could be
washed and a car was standing there
dripping-waiting on our convenience
before it was dried and the car was
a racing merk which was painted an
elephant gray

chapter four

that i was rattled i make no shame
to confess

  indeed the shock was so great that i
cannot clearly remember what hap-
pened next

  i know that the cap was screwed on
and that when the man came to the door
i could not understand what he said
and that katharine had to tell me how
much i must pay then i started the
car and backed out while the washer
stood looking on and waving me back
and once i was in the roadway i put the
lowland in first and drove straight on
careless of where i went so long as i
left that cursed garage behind

  at length- perhaps he wont talk
i said unless they-they ask him
theresno reason why he should

  what does it matter esau whether
they ask him or not theyre here-
at cardinals gates if they breakfast at
eight they can be there by half-past
ten she cupped her face in her hands
you see im a broken reed i said
theyd try elsewhere first but i got them
wrong id hoped for a day or two of
respite-a chance to rest and refit and
now my god-

  tell me this said i are we on
the right road 

  for cardinal yes
  good enough said i and put down
my foot that brush was damned un-
pleasant-ill give you that but we do
know where they are andthat to me
at least is a great relief and now lets
look at it this way as like as not their
visit has already been paid the car-
dinal coverts been drawn and since it
yielded no fox theyre on their way off
of course theyll come back-very soon
but at least we shall have our respite-
our chance to rest and refit

  you may be right said katharine
what if youre wrong

  we shall still have our respite said
i from what you said awhile back
they cant force their way in let the

swine wait our convenience if after
thinking things over we still consider it
better to-to go our way well choose
our time and do so im damned if ill
be rushed by a couple of burglars who
happen to want my life

  katharine made no answer but i felt
her eyes on my face i went on steadily
im not so sure youre right when
you say we must stay off the map i
see two things against it first if youre
off his map the enemy must be off
yours and that is very trying at least
i think it would be-moving with your
chin on your shoulder from morning to
night secondly some day or other
youve got to come on it again i mean

i dont wonder yon love it i said and its secret is safe with me


the blue book magazine

that stands to reason ive only got
three months leave

  are you suggesting esau that you
should stand and fight 

  im suggesting nothing said i im
thinking aloud

  i dont like your thoughts very much
for one thing only those two can play
with a pistol but you are not armed
and if they ran into us now theyd
bump you off like brushing a fly off their
nose i mean that esau franee is not
like england theyd never hear any
more of their-escapade

  ill take your word for that but
the honest truth is that neither you nor
i will be fit to work out our salvation
until we have had some rest and when
i say rest i mean a bath and breakfast
i dont feel a bit like sleep

  with the tail of my eye i saw her give
her short nod

  theres common sense she said
well have things out when weve had
a wash and brush-up but do get hold
of this that we are up against people
who know no law theyll go all lengths
to get us-because they will not be able
to take their rest until they know that
we are no longer alive

  since a girl should have the last word
i left it there but i felt that that state-
ment of hers had proved my case un-
less i stood and fought i must prepare
to be hunted for years to come which
was absurd the thing was to choose
ones ground and to come to grips

for the next two hours we ran through
lovely country-hill and dale and
woodland with here and there a village
but never a town the day being sunday
the traffic was very slight but the work-
aday world was awake by seven oclock
and bells were ringing and peasants were
going to mass the morning was very
handsome i never saw sunlight so bril-
liant in my life and the meadows were
cloth-of-silver because of a heavy dew

  just twenty minutes later the low-
land swam over some crest to enter
woods so thick that the view upon either
hand was wholly obscured and though
the road twisted and turned and rose
and fell for the next two miles we never
saw any country but only the curtains
of foliage hanging and swaying and
glancing to right and to left

  katharine was speaking

  lift your foot for a moment were
coming to a break in the trees its
round the next bend half a minute

wont matter and id like you to see-
my home

  i did as she said as i rounded the
bend at twenty i saw the gap she spoke
of some fifty paces ahead abreast of
this i stopped

   i was looking across a valley the op-
posite side of which was as thickly wood-
ed as ours below were lying green
meadows bordered with piled stone
walls and a stream was tumbling
through them-i could see the flourish
of foam where a rock rose out of its
bed what caught the eye at once was
the way in which woods and meadows
were taking each others ground for the
trees ran down in irregular lines and
patches into the fields to pay for this
pretty trespass by casting their shade
upon the grass and now and again the
meadows climbed up by linchets into
the arms of the woods and other things
caught the eye astride the stream was
lying a tiny village whose walls were
white and whose roofs were an old rose
red a pocket church was thrusting a
little belfry a toy of a bridge was span-
ning the busy stream and a water-wheel
was dripping with silver and smoke was
rising into the breathless air ovr 
the air of contentment and simple amour
propre cried out for the pen of a gold-
smith to catch a charm which i cannot
hope to describe and above the village
was hanging a miniature castle exactly
as its mistress had said sunk in the
living green its old gray stone looked
finer than any jewel and it made me
think of a cameo brooched to a hand-
some cloak all the lovely detail was
there-battlement turret and mullion
the slender spire of a chapel the terrace
the old stone steps nothing had been
omitted by the builders who set it up
yet all was lilliputian it was a baby
stronghold ruling a baby town

as we entered the village i turned to
l katharine to see the softest look in
her fine gray eyes

   i dont wonder you love it i said
and its secret is safe with me for if i
told someone about it hed write me off
as a liar and leave it there

  katharine smiled-for the first time
for fully four hours

   lets have a close-up she said but
dont expect too much cardinal has a
guest-chamber but youre the first guest
weve had

   force majeure  said i and let in my
clutch
when the devil drives

yes in a way i suppose and yet
that night at newhaven i wished so
much that i could show you my home
no man could ask for a sweeter invi-
tation than that

  katharine looked straight ahead
you were nice to me she said and
you asked no-no payment at all and
what upset me was your eyes they were
down on the ground when they should
have been lifted up and cardinal stood
out so clearly as the ideal corrective for
crutched friars

two hours had gore by i hadbathed
and changed and conrad the eng-
lish butler had brought me a blessed
breakfast of eggs and coffee and honey
and new-baked bread all this in two
very small chambers paneled with oak
never before had i used apartments so
fine and the sunlight seemed the richer
for falling upon such carving of wood and
stone and now i was down on the ter-
race to which i had found my way sur-
veying the pageant before me and gladly
admitting the force of my ladys words
cardinal was a corrective you could
not get away from the fact that the
peasants who worked in the mills and
th meadows below were better off than
a merchant in crutched friars

  then i put such thoughts aside and
began to consider my surroundings from
a fugitives point of view looking
across the village i saw the gap in the
woods from which i had viewed the cas-
tle two hours before from there though
i could not see it because of the trees i
knew that the road fell down unusually
sharp doubling upon itself to gain the
valley below this descent being over
i saw it curl into the meadows some fifty
yards south of the bridge and from
there i could follow with ease the line
which it took-over the jolly water and
into the village place and then up a
very steep hill which presently brought
it up to the castles gate two other
roads ran into the little place but kath-
arine had told me that the one by which
we had come was the only road which
led to the world outside

  we had therefore but one to watch
but i could not lose sight of the fact that
if we wished to drive out from the castle
we had but one road to take-a narrow
way that could not be taken at speed
such roads are dangerous

  and then i turned to see katharine
framed in a little docrway

  as i stepped to her side she said you
were right the enemys been and gone
someone inquired at the village yester-
day afternoon whoever it was was on
foot so there must have been a car in
the offing which didnt appear

  good said i have you given the
servants orders-to let no strangers in
yes ive told conrad-something
she put a hand to her head whats
going to be so hard is my father ive
told him nothing so far i dont know
where to begin

  i bit my lip then i think i ought
to know what youve said about me
ive lied-as usual she said ive
had to do it for years but it only seems
to get harder as time goes by she
looked away twisting her hands he
thinks im a secretary-to a very big
business man offices in london and
paris that accounts for my flitting be-
tween the two i call him mr shepherd
-you see its all founded on fact and
now ive told him this-that you met me
yesterday evening you found me be-
side the road with my car burned out
everything i had with me had gone with
the car so as you were only touring you
offered to bring me home i said that
you were making for carcassonne
why carcassonne i said staring
well you had to be making for some-
where i had to think of some name
thats all right i said gently i
only wanted to know i glanced at a
cushioned bench before i meet him
dyou think we could have a talk
thats why im here she said hes
down in the village now a colt has
hurt itself and he is so strong and so
gentle theyve sent for him they al-
ways do but i dont like his going
much he had an attack of angina two
years ago and any effort is bad when
you suffer from that she moved to the
bench and took her seat on its arm we
seem to have got our breather how
long do you think itll last 

  as long as we please said i id
no idea that cardinal was so strong

katharine raised her eyebrows
im not going to stay here esau
im not such a fool

  i fingered my chin in that case
said i theres nothing more to be said
what time dyou propose we should
leave 

  we must leave by night-on foot its
the only way

the devil driveg to even more exciting adventures in the next-the augutt-initallment

sr<5>sp

though he had made seven
voyages in her forecastle chris
arnold came up the bridge lad-
der slowly as if it were new to
him he walked over to the mate
who was a tall man and schoolship-
trained

 the old-captain pope has made
me acting fourth officer sir chris ar-
nold said to mr davis

  mr davis didnt say anything out
of his prominent eyes he stared down at
chris the mates bulging eyes always
made him look startled now com-
bined with silence he looked thunder-
struck

  the young ab suffered under the
strain of that blank interval he start-
ed to explain its so when youre work-
ing cargo all day at the island ports ill
stand your bridge watch sir and youll
have all night in

  aleck munro first assistant engineer
who had been overhauling the telemotor
gear suddenly stuck his grinning face
out of the wheelhouse door

  all night in  he said he smacked
his lips and edged toward the bridge lad-
der all night in and nothing to do all
day maybe ye can learn to sail a small-
boat now mister mate 

  he ducked away before the mate could
let go his tongue

  mr davis sniffed engine-room oil
he said with great distaste to the highly
interested second officer that fellow
will never get over that time i allowed
him to sail past me

  the second officers grin was broad
the mate frowned and swiveled his eyes
to chris arnold who was still there
right under the guns

  acting fourth officer mr davis
said theres a rank for you ive
heard that cockroaches have cooties
now by peter i believe it 

  haw  the second mate was de-
lighted acting fourth  a cockroachs
cootie thats one  he laughed
again but this time it was at the mate
a good one but not as good as the old
mans pulled on you  

  mr davis increasing scowl blackened

 bitterly contested ships boat
race and a trick keel teach
the tune of command

by richard
howells watkins

the day for chris arnold the mate
seemed ready to let fly his eyes one-
two like stones out of a sling

   keep from underfoot while im stand-
ing my watches or ill step on you
mr davis said he shook a finger like
a club at chris i asked for an experi-
enced junior not something thats just
crawled in through the hawsehole

   i have my third mates license sir
when tickets make officers underwrit-
ers will go broke said the mate off
the bridge 

  everybody liked a joke on the mate
for he had removed much skin with his
whiplash of a tongue chris arnold
youngest ab in the ship as the fourth
officer for whom the mate had been clam-
oring was a good one the old man
who had to play his jokes with a dead
pan on account of his dignity knew well
that the conscientious mate would stand
every minute of his four-to-eight morn-
ing and evening watches no matter how
busy he was with cargo at the island
ports of call it was a good one

but to be a joke as chris arnold now
was to be even a good joke can be
tough it can be so tough in fact that
weary chris arnold took a long hard
look at the beach when she dropped her
hook in st thomas harbor all the way
down from brooklyn to the virgins the
embittered mr davis pacing the bridge
had belabored the joke since the joker
was above him

  mr arnold go down and show
those soldiers on the foredeck how to
handle a chipping hammer-and con-
tinue showing em till eight bells hit
twice their pace-and keep hitting it   

  mr acting fourth some of those
fellows seem afraid that souji mouji will
burn their delicate hands give em a
lead show em how to clean painf like
an officer and a gentleman and to blazes
with hands ill struggle along up here
by myself 

  those cargo-nets are bad mr ar-
nold you couldnt trust em to hold a
rubber elephant they need an officers
touch yours mister put your back
into your work or ill put my foot into
your back

  it wasnt the work it was being a
joke the bewildered chris arnold
wasnt flesh fowl nor good red herring
in that ship he was neither officer nor
seaman he wasnt even a flunky he
hadnt figured that studying navigation
in the forecastle would make him the
butt of the ship even if her watch offi-
cers were all schoolship-trained men

  tt was quite as tough with the men as
with the officers he got no backing
from the bridge when he pointed out
a patch of rust that bauman a morose
ab had skipped bauman dropped his
chipping hammer and spat on hands that
were hard as a goats hoofs

  spose you make me scale that plate
kid the ab said

  theres no good wastin paint on
rust-blisters like that chris said kick-
ing at the plate with his heel

  make me scale it kid bauman re-
peated he had a body as thick and
hard as a barrel and his long massive
arms curved like ice-tongs

 chris arnold gulped air he was
alone he had nobody standing behind
him he couldnt lick bauman who
wras an ex-pug was it better to take a
lacing than to back down he wasnt
sure he could take a lacing standing
up but what would it get him he
hesitated

  on the foredeck  hailed the mate
from the bridge keep-that hammer
going mister keep it going

  slowly chris picked up his hammer

  bauman laughed thats the trou-
ble with the mate-he dont like mur-
der in the ship an it would ha been
murder kid-fast murder

  i always wanted to see how they
buried a guy at sea said a seaman

bauman elaborately avoided the
plate that started the controversy
that night chris had slipped back on the
foredeck with a scraper there was no
use painting over rust and he had a
proper feeling for the old bucket he
found the neglected spot but he didnt
scrape it down he just stood there look-
ing at the deck to do that job seemed
to be an acceptance of defeat

  he hadnt a friend in the ship now-
or even a real enemy but there were
other ships ships on which a young offi-
cer would get the backing-up essential
to discipline

  chris arnold hardened his jaw this
had been a happy ship barring a little
trouble between deck officers and engi-
neers with a decent enough old man
when cargo was light there was some
time off and some fun among the islands
down the line of the antilles to trini-
dad and hed had a step even if every-
body did seem to think an acting fourth
officer was a cockroachs cootie

  maybe i am a cockroachs cootie
however they rate or rank me he told
himself at four one morning when he
stood in the leeward cab of the bridge
as far away from the red-eyed and weary
mr davis as he could get he was ac-
quiring the habit of talking to himself
usually any guy thats treated as a
joke by his shipmates is a joke   
they got a line for it-not officer mate-
rial maybe i dont get any backing
from davis because he knows im a
swab not fit to stand a watch

the mate began tramping the bridge
slowly as if his feet hurt him hed
overseen the juggling of cargo at three
island ports the day before

 the old man might give me my
ab rating back chris muttered to
himself he shook his head not yet
not quite yet

  things were still like that at port of
spain trinidad where the amalia lay
over two days before turning north
again

  long before the ship was finished
working cargo mr davis had one and
two lifeboats overside all hands knew
what that meant the brooding mr
davis was about to challenge and take
over the jumps the bumptious mr aleck
munro and with him the whole engi-
neers department

  in a little brush of the lifeboats off
dominica two runs before mr munro
who claimed to have been the cream of
clyde sailors in his youth had actually
jammed his boat past mr davis under
sail and mr davis had been trained
in his schoolship days in handling lug-
rigged lifeboats it wras the contention
of the deck that a gust of wind off do-
minicas towering mountains was more
responsible for that than any sailing
prowess of the first engineer neverthe-
less mr munro had borne down hard

  it was put up or shut up for mr mun-
ro now

  the plump and sociable old man who
was about to escape the grueling neces-
sity for standing on his dignity by a visit

davis said

 to the ice house ashore dismissed his
  shore boat and hung about the bridge to
  se the race twice chris arnold
  caught him whistling like a bird at the
  prospect of sport and was frowned up-
  on in consequence the chief engineer
  the skippers only comrade joined him
  and frozen-faced they awaited action by
  their respective departments

   muttered details of a bet reached
 chris arnolds ears this could be fun
 were not chris a pariah in this ship he
 ached for a chance to bear a hand in
 the mates boat

    mr davis passing by caught his eye

    im a good man at tending a sheet
  sir chris said

   get down in number two tween-
 decks mister acting fourth and show
 em how to tend a broom mr davis
 commanded brooms are more in your
 line than sheets

   when chris arnold climbed out of
 the hold three hours later the breeze
 came fresh to his dust-choked lungs
 it had been a hard sweep-down he
 smeared the dirt and sweat on his face
 against his sleeve and looked eagerly
 overside the clinker-built boats with
 masts unstepped still lay alongside
 soaking up

    what happened lippy he asked a
  messboy

  munro got leary the boy said
claims he had to sew a few patches on
the boilers or somethin anyhow he
aint got time to sail against the mate
this after maybe tomorrow he says
chris arnold was relieved he want-
ed to see that race even if he wouldnt
be one of the lifeboat crew it would
even be some joy to see an engineer wipe
mr davis ferocious eye

 lippy edged closer to him how
about puttin in a word for me for ordi-
nary seaman sir  i dont want to be no
pot-juggler

  it was the first time chris arnold had
been called sir save in mockery in
that ship he shook his head a word
from me would be a ticket as messboy
for life lippy

  aw hell  said lippy

  perhaps aleck munro and the other
engineers were struggling with some
whimsy of the rock-crusher below any-
the blue etjotc magazine

how not a man of them went ashore that
evening which was news but the old
man the second and the third officers
all piled off in shore boats as soon as
possible frederick street-and other
streets-called

  the mate who was short of sleep had
volunteered to remain aboard acidly
he declined chris offer to take the deck

  between yoti and nobody ill put my
two dollars on nobody he said go
below go ashore go to blazes-but keep
off that bridge

  to the sulky bauman who was on
anchor watch the mate commanded
curtly 

  call me if needed

  then rapidly he went to his room to
make up some of the shut-eye he had
missed among the islands

  chris arnold wrote a letter and tried
to get to sleep himself but the ship
was still glowing hot from the vertical
trinidad sun the water alongside the

soupy water of the gulf of paria was
too warm to cool off anything and the
air motionless was humid enough to
drink he got up in his pajamas and
roamed the ship

  near the accommodation ladder he
came upon bauman stretched out on
deck and breath ng like a cargo winch
there was a bottle beside him chris
arnold picked it up it was cognac
good cognac from martinique probably
chris frowned it wasnt the sort of
thing bauman would spend his money
on he ran to quantity rather than
quality in his taste

  chris arnolds hair prickled on his
skull maybe some dirty-work was
afoot he walked aft to the galley and
near it located lippys bunk lippy
wasnt asleep chris dragged him out

  watch that gangway he command-
ed im going to take a look around
the ship

  his search for villainy began on the
boat-deck and ended there near the
fiddley he halted eyes wide

the boat-deck seemed aswarm with
men they were working with cautious-
ly screened flashlights chris arnold
stared and listened a wayward flash
or two of the torches helped engineers
these were the engineers-the first sec-
ond third and junior engineers in the
blackness the engineers were as busy as
gnomes

it wns the first ume
chris had been ealled
sir on that ship
the fourth officer

  they had hauled up and swung in on
the davits number two boat the boat
that aleck munro was to sail next day
the blocks hadnt so much as creaked
they had been well oiled-an engi-
neers trick and now they were very
busy with more engineering stuff-nuts
and bolts

  a flashlight focused momentarily on
the shallow keel of the lifeboat-and
chris arnold grunted holes had been
bored through the long strip of wood
and now these engineers were very busy
bolting on a section of sheet metal that
dropped a full foot below the embryonic
keel of the lifeboat they were giving
her a keel like a racing sloop

  somebody in the dark took hold of
chris arnolds arm the steel-like
clamp of the fingers made chris think
once more of the engine room and its
mechanical might his head swiveled
swiftly the chief engineer himself was
standing beside him in the gloom

   jus a bit of fun said the chief soft-
ly a bit of a joke on the mate are
ye on duty 

  loyalties squirmed inside chris ar-
nold but that mention of the mate qui-
eted his conscience this had nothing
to do with the deck it was on the mate

  i have the mates own word that im
not on duty he answered grinning so
it was the black-gang that set up cognac
for the anchor watch hey 

  mr worsley sighed faintly it was
necessary he said man what a
waste 

  the black-gang will take over the
gangway watch then i suppose said
chris arnold im going to sleep my-
self

he went back to the vigilant lippy
who jumped violently at the sound
of his footfalls

   go to bed chris arnold said its
just some kids out ringing doorbells

   in the first dog-watch of another dog-
day chris arnold emerged from a dusty
oven number four hold this time and
wearily crossed the burning steel deck
to the port side the noise was coming
from that side and the whole crew was
strung out along the rail

  the waters of the muddy gulf were
roiled by the brisk east-northeast trade-
wind and up that wind zigzagging in-
to it each with two lugsails drawing
came the two lifeboats of the amalia

  the lifeboat of the engineers num-
ber two was well ahead and came along

like a cup defender aleck munro the
picture of nonchalance lounged in the
sternsheets with a casual hand on the
tiller that sheet of metal invisible
under her gave the boat a grip on the
water preventing her from sliding side-
wise

  mr davis sitting abruptly upright in
his boat had passed the stage of skill
and was fighting his tiller

chris arnold lifted an eye to the
bridge the old man dead-pan as
usual was leaning his portly stomach
against the rail beside him rocking
blandly on toes and heels with his pipe
drawing was the chief engineer he
met chris eye without a flicker of emo-
tion

  munros boat made a final hitch and
drove across an imaginary finish line at
the bow of the amalia promptly the
boatswain jerked a lanyard and the line-
throwing gun barked congratulation

  the mate finished ingloriously later
it may have been the razzing he got
that wiped the grin off chris arnolds
face or possibly it was the fact that
aleck munro was showing no remorse
whatsoever he was offering to race the
mate again standing on his head with
his eyes blindfolded and his hands tied
behind his back

  chris glanced up at the bridge to see
if the chief engineer were now spilling
the joke to captain pope he wasnt
both men were looking away from the
boats toward a ship that had come
through the dragons mouth into the
gulf and now was sliding cautiously to
an anchorage chris saw she was the
amaryllis a sister ship whose run was
down the east coast of south america

  her men had been watching the race
shortly after she let go her crew with
more enthusiasm than usual swung out
her lifeboats the wind had quit by
then but men were busy in her boats
till dark

  that night captain pope shot off to
have dinner with the amaryllis old
man they had been shipmates to-
gether  they were both masters the old
man could damn his dignity and have
a good time with an equal he was
heard to whistle in the boat

  chris arnold got grudging leave that
night and took his troubles to a movie
the people on the screen were having
trouble too but chris arnold still had
his with him when he headed back to
st vincents jetty
  he found near the wharf a little group
ef men earnestly engaged in chaffering
with each other closer to chris made
them out to be most of the officers of
the amalia and the amaryllis the
third officer deigned to tell him what it
was all about

  our old man made a bet with the
amaryllis skipper that even one of our
engineers could outsail any man they
picked easy money 

  it was apparent just by listening for a
moment that all the wages the amalias
crowd would draw in the next three
months had been placed upon the nose
of aleck munro

  there was one exception aleck mun-
ro and the second engineer were present
and neither was risking a nickel but
they were very pleased chris arnold
scrubbed his jaw in thought

  the black-gang knows all bets wjll
be called off after munro wins and they
hoist out the lifeboat with that keel on
her he decided thats it all right
just another little joke on the deck

when he started for a boat aleck
munro followed him to caution
him to keep silent

  it would be most awkward for you
young fellow if the mate tumbled that
yed known about the keel the first
said impressively most awkward
he pointed the acting fourth officer
into a shore boat and followed himself

  chris arnold nodded im not say-
ing a word he said ive got enough
grief to hold me now

  the boatmen swung their oars

  aleck munro tapped him on the chest
yell have sweet revenge on the deck-
on fevery ruddy one o them he assured
arnold his voice sank to a hoarse and
conspiratorial whisper the beauty of
all this dye see is that by the terms o
the two skippers agreement theres to
be no special equipment an no tinker-
ing with the boats on the penalty of the
other side winning the race by default
he rocked in his seat suppressing a
vesuvius of mirth the beauty of it 
he gasped my keel in the hole will
slay em there ont be a dime left in
a deck-officers pocket for months
theyll learn-the lubbers wait till
the boat comes out an they get a look
a that keel bettin on engineers a
fine deck that is 

  and a fine acting fourth officer i
am chris arnold told himself two
hours later that blight h was still

pacing the deck a judas to the deck
-an more than that that flighty
black-gang dont see that its the ships
name theyre triflin with winnin a
race with a keel in the hole but whats
a ships name to an engineer i ought
to split to the old man 

  but he didnt do that instead at
one in the morning when the anchor
watch was slumbering as peacefully as
if the engineers had set up the cognac
again chris arnold was shaking lippy
into life

  come on and keep quiet  he com-
manded

  the lifeboats were moored astern
down the line went chris lippy
spurred on because it was a seagoing job
went with him in number two life-
boat they shifted ballast spars water-
breaker and equipment over to port to
give her a heel then with a monkey
wrench clutched in his hand chris ar-
nold went over the side

  he had heard a lot about sharks and
barracuda in tropical seas he could
fairly feel them tearing at him as he
thrust his legs down into the quiet black
water slowly he lowered himself under
every ripple was a shark turning to at-
tack every splash was the flying fins ot a
barracuda charging to strike with a
mouthful of teeth like a sawmill

  the engineers had set up those bolts
on the sheet-metal keel as if they were
to hold an engine on her bed-plates
chris arnold swore and strained he
thrust his body under braced his legs
on her bottom and strained again the
job was below water even with the life-
boat heeled over he thought his heart
was going from the inhuman exertion
without air to breath finally he start-
ed one bolt

  by this time he had consigned sharks
and barracuda to perdition their tear-
ing would only release him from torture
stubbornly he struggled those nuts
had been turned to stay lippy awed
by the battle perched on the port rail
with a noose in his hand

chris finished the job he got the
last bolt out of the plate he felt
the keel drop swerving toward the bot-
tom of the roadstead lippy dragged
his limp body aboard lippy straight-
ened up the boat chris stretched out-
flat panting himself back to life it was
tough going up the line to the deck

  now let em sail  chris said hoarse-
ly the deckll lose their pay but the
wait till the
boat comes out
and they see that
keel

shipll hang onto her good name any-
how a ships good name is like a wom-
ans lippy it dont come back

  the exigencies of cargo held over the
rae until four next afternoon ordi-
narily she would not have had her
hatches on until eight that night but
even the stevedores were caught in the
swing and drive of the crews impa-
tience and only number five a slow
hatch was working cargo at four

  chris arnold looked the first assistant
engineer in the eye and demanded a
place in the crew of five

  youd rather have me working in
your boat than talking in the ship
wouldnt you  he asked

  ah well said aleck munro  tis
blackmail but what can ye expect of a
deck man get in

  time compelled a short race the
race committee consisting of the two
skippers now together on the bridge of
the amalia sent them away down-wind
toward a dirty little coaster anchored a
mile farther out in the shallow gulf

  mr munro pleasantly confident had
maneuvered his craft well in the crucial
seconds before the old men let go the
starting gun he slid over the line with
fore and main lugs goosewinged out to
port and starboard but the snub-
nosed leather-faced mate of the amaryl-
lis was quite as confident was he not
racing an engineer he crossed the line

almost alongside munros boat and with
his bow only a scant six feet behind

  chris arnold tending the fore-sheet
kept his eye on every slight movement
of the canvas this was a fair race
even if his skipper wasnt aware of it
chris didnt want the amalias boat de-
feated too badly

  he may beat us on this leg boys
but when we start back to windward-
mr munro winked knowingly at his
crew chris arnold understood that he
was thinking that his sheet-metal keel
a liability as it dragged along under wa-
ter going downwind like this would be a
crushing advantage in checking the lee-
ward slide of the boat once she was zig-
zagging upwind

  not knowing that that keel was now
on the bottom of the gulf the first en-
gineer was fully prepared to be a poor
second in rounding the coaster and
starting home when he found that his
boat was holding its own downwind
against the amaryllis his opinion of his
own skill took a sudden jump

  this button-nosed lubber is worse
than our mate he muttered to the sec-
the blue book magazine

ond engineer who was handling the
main-sheet  he eyed the other boat
which was not yet bow and bow with
his i could beat that fellow with-
out- he paused and added lamely
without difficulty

one advantage the mate of the ama-
ryllis seized he was to starboard
of munro  and in rounding the coaster
she was to be left to starboard that
gave him the inside berth on the turn

  neither boat tried any covering these
heavy boats werent built for yachting
shenannigans mr munro continued to
admire himself audibly as the other boat
gained only a few feet on him

  the snub-nosed mate heard him get
a line ready the amaryllis man bawled
to his crew once we quit blowin
downhill the black-gang will need a tow
home

  why that- 

  mr munro ceased to search for ad-
jectives the coaster was looming up
close ahead the mate was hugging
her close

  ill show him how its done on the
clyde said the first engineer to the
second softly

  no monkey business  the second
warned

  mr munro did not answer but his
face was still brick red under his sandy
hair he swung wide of the plates of
the coaster when i give the word
gybe over that main he muttered
keep sheets eased but be ready to
close haul her

  the second looking at his angry face
perspired gently

  shell do it with-you know mut-
tered mr munro ill wipe his eye
right 

  the mate of the amaryllis reaching
the stern of the coaster gave her hidden
propeller a good berth-too good a berth
-as he rounded

  youll foul him if you try it the
second warned

  but mr munro confident of his non-
existent keel was already trying it he
put down his tiller and sent his boat
with wind abeam knifing for the gap
between the unseen propeller of the
coaster and the side of the amaryllis
boat

  he made it by scant inches he made
it as far as the other boat was con-
cerned how close he was to the blades
of the propeller no man knew but he
won the inside berth

  confusion reigned in the mates boat
he was shouting too many orders mr
munro confident of his good engine-
room-produced keel hardened on the
wind and prepared to enjoy himself he
put a lazy foot up on the gunwale and
kissed his hand to the angry mate of
the amaryllis	

  ill tell em youre coming he called
chris arnold kept one eye on the fore-
sheet and the other on mr munro who
was so soon to be disillusioned the
eye on the engineer became sharp with
speculation and wonder

  for mr munro sailed that boat ut-
terly care-free utterly sure that he would
win he relaxed completely on port hitch
or starboard he go all she had in her and
more he knew she could do it and
she did

  down-wind from him and losing all
the time floundered the amaryllis boat
the mate like mr davis on the day be- j
fore was fighting his tiller and fighting
his wind he was cursing his crew and
his boat the sails were wrong and the
breaks were bad

  right up to the finish-line mr munro
swept along in unchallenged triumph
chris arnolds eyes at the finish gun
were still on the first assistant engineer
with a question churning in them

  past the amaryllis and up to the
amalia mr munro sailed his boat and
his grin widened as he received the ap-
plause of the jubilant-and now wealthy
-deck officers of his own ship all
hands were there on the boat-deck the
two old men the sourly smiling mr
davis the deck the black-gang and the
stewards all

  wait till they see the keel-and the
amaryllis crowd see it munro said
softly to the second engineer and
then stand by to dodge bricks and dead
cats from both ships 

the second nodded he was some-
what apprehensive about that fine
joke chris arnold watching him was
thinking hard

  down sails  the engineer command-
ed as he spilled the wind and headed her
for her swinging davit falls unstep
masts

  they hooked on the tackles and the
cheering crew of the amalia hoisted the
boat on the run she was on the side
nearer the a maryllis

  they dont see it yet said mr mun-
ro as the boat was hauled up short on
the davits get ready to run


the fourth officer

  he leaped out of the boat onto the
deck of the amalia prepared to take
refuge with the black-gang the cheer-
ing increased suddenly air munro
halted he stared incredulously at the
lifeboat the rest of the black-gang were
staring with him only the bolt-holes
in the narrow wooden keel revealed that
this was indeed the craft onto which
they had bolted so securely that solid
piece of sheet metal

  mr munros face was a study and
chris arnold was studying it slowly
the realization came to the first assist-
ant that he had beaten the amaryllis
fair and square

chris sensed the tumult inside mun-
ro he didnt know he was good
enough to win without a keel to back
him up chris told himself by pe-
ter that might be whats screwy with
me do i need anybody elses backing
up to be an officer ive got to get an
answer to that one

  he was only half aware of the scowl
that ripped across aleck munros face
and was succeeded by an expression of
great pain

  on the faces of the other black-gang
officers a similar anguish showed there
wd a touch of the scot in every man of
them now it was dawning on them
they had put a great financial oppor-
tunity in the way of the deck and
they had kicked that same great finan-
cial opportunity in the face themselves
aleck munro had won impeccably

  ah what a waste of money  moaned
mr worsley what a sinful waste
but greatest was the pain on mr
munros own face ive been gypped
he cried to the world in reckless fury
ive been robbed i had a keel on
her somebody snitched it i and i had
forty dollars bet on the a maryllis boat
there was no sympathy on mr wors-
leys face and its your deserts-
wagerin on another ship  he said

  air davis grabbed the first engineers
arm did you have your keel on her
when you raced me yesterday he de-
manded

  i did that-and made a double mon-
key out o you   said mr munro wildly
he swung around of a sudden on chris
arnold you- its you  he cried
you unbolted that keel you-you-
i did said chris arnold in the
middle watch he laughed he roared
with laughter he poked his face boldly

forward at the angry fist of the engineer
whats the good of a keel to you you
dont need a keel-the way you sail em
my forty-

  but chris arnold pushed past him
he had to get the answer to his red-hot
question that wouldnt wait he was
sure now he had a grip on the thing but
he must prove it he ploughed through
the uproarious mob around munro and
on to bauman ab on the outskirts

  ive learned something bauman
he said softly through his teeth i
dont need any backing to make you
obey i didnt know that but i do
now youre going to chip the rust off a
spot i pointed out to you

  youre crazy as a bug said bau-
man staring ill-

  chris shook his head its an or-
der bauman im acting fourth officer
of this ship maybe you wont chip off
that spot now maybe youll knock me
out with that big fist of yours first but
when i come to sailor im coming back
to you with whatever is heaviest thats
handy ill repeat that order bauman
unless you kill me sailor youre going
to chip rust get going 

bauman looked at chris set face
baumans feet began to move he
was on the ladder before he knew it
why hell i was just kiddin he pro-
tested outraged hell kid ill-
mister arnold to you keep mov-
ing

  mister arnold i wasnt refusin duty

i-

  bauman got a chipping hammer he
chipped rust-right

  chris arnold left him chris was
feeling weak but his walk was strong
and his jaw looked tough on the low-
er bridge he met mr davis he started
past him it occurred to him then that
the mate didnt miss much that hap-
pened on that ship

  the mate stopped him chris ar-
nold went hot again

  so what he said i dont need a
school-ship or backing either or a
berth in this ship i know that now and
on my own steam ill get a job-
stow the gab commanded air da-
vis harshly his eyes swelled and got
ready to let go one-two i asked for
an experienced officer as a fourth all
right ive got one grab some sleep
if you need me during your bridge
watch ill be in my bunk

           a memorable story of china today by the able au-
           thor of the fourth messenger and cold blood 

by hugh wiley

        hour after sunrise cheng lin
  of the beggars guild took his
post against the warm wall of
--the smiling friend pawnshop
on blue hill road here with a caged
sunbird of brilliant plumage he awaited
his patrons the sunbird whose name
was chong was the act that reaped the
copper cash for cheng lin the bird was
caged in an ornate structure of gilded
bamboo that enclosed the drooping
branches of a dwarfed willow tree in
payment for one grain of millet the sun-
bird would chirp a note or two for five
grains of millet he would repay the favor
with twelve or fifteen liquid notes of a
pleasing song

  from the birds musical contributions
to the din of blue hill road cheng lin
would translate predictions of good luck
for which customers might pay with cop-
per cash on good days the total receipts
from the sunbirds efforts would amount
to twenty cents but if the day were cold
or if rain came cheng lin would have to
eat his evening rice in the guild house
kitchen on credit evening rice for the
beggars guild included rice and fish
lung soup strips of pork and now and
then a cup of black wine for the guild
members lived well in spite of the war-
cloud that hung over the chinese city

  chengs territory against the wall of
the smiling friend pawnshop was a thir-
ty-foot space that included at midday
the cooling shadow of a balcony here
in the smile of kwan yin enjoying the
favors of milo fo cheng lived life as it
came contemplating the beauty of the
resplendent chong and the graceful
curves of the branches of the dwarfed wil-
low in the sunbirds cage

  the sunbirds name was chong be-
cause he was faithful and loyal and his
cage was nicely equipped with a cloisonne
cup for his dry food a porcelain cup for
bits of fruit and green leaves and a lit-
tle brass water-tank wherein at his pleas-

ure he might bathe for relief from the
midday heat or drink to assuage his
thirst

  at evening off duty chong would sing
for an hour or two in the guild house
and at morning his song was the first in-
terruption to the guttural sriores that
filled the sleeping-room chong was re-
spected by all of cheng lins compan-
ions and his owner was considered a for-
tunate man various beggars with no
better exhibits than ulcerated arms or
twisted legs or leprosy envied cheng
lin and many offers of large cash had
been made for chong invariably these
had been refused for cheng lin realized
his own limitations hp knew that choftg
was the source of his income and he
doubted his ability to make a living with-
out the sunbirds help

  at midday a wisp of scouting planes
came out of the south and circled the
city within the hour they were fol-
lowed by a squadron of bombers the
first explosion on blue hill road de-
stroyed the smiling friend pawnshop
i

  cheng lin returned from a brief jour-
ney away from life his left side was
wet with blood that flowed from a wound
in his shoulder and a flap of his scalp
hung over his right ear he crawled out
of the debris about him and gained the
unbroken pavement of blue hill road
three young boys in uniform stopped the
blood that flowed from his shoulder an
american doctor in an emergency dress-
ing-station sewed the flap of his scalp
back into place and sterilized both
wounds

 cheng was conscious of a burning
thirst presently he realized vaguely that
half of his mind seemed to be sleeping
he turned instinctively toward the house
of the beggars guild he had covered
half the distance to this poor sanctuary
before the question of his sunbirds fate
came to complicate the tortured hour

  he returned to the wreck of the smil-
ing friend pawnshop for a while he
searched for the sunbird but all that
came of this was the discovery of a frag-
ment of the gilded cage wherein the sun-
bird had lived and a blackened twig that
might have been a branch of the dwarfed
willow

  he lay unconscious for a while there-
after inert until the cool airs of evening
came bearing their little gift of life
chong was gone hope in cheng lins
heart was dead throughout his plodding
toward the house of the beggars guild
there were places along the way where
corpses lined the road and on one street
it was necessary to detour around the
wreckage of a hundred houses

  the severed hand of a woman lay in
the street at the entrance to the guild
house a gold-piece near the severed
hand gleamed faintly in the light of a
street-lamp cheng-lin picked it up
clutched in the dead hand he found two
other gold coins he took these and en-
tered the house of the beggars guild

  a barrage of reproach greeted him

  see now the death and destruction
that your former companions disciples of
violence have wrought

  a man can be forgiven for the mis-
takes of his youth cheng lin returned
in his own defense true enough i was
a soldier before i gained wisdom

  enough of bitterness another mem-
ber of the company advised our com-
panion is wounded he has paid for his
folly

  one of the beggars examined chengs
wounded shoulder and lifted the bandage
from his torn scalp you are to be en-
vied this man said that cut in your
shoulder and your broken head proper-
ly developed can be worth large cash to
you

  a handful of sand rubbed into that
cut on your head can become a sore so
disgusting that even a priest would give
you alms another advised

  what of the sunbird chong another
asked

  chong is dead cheng lin said his
song is ended

  now there was a quick chatter of sym-
pathy which was suddenly stopped by
the booming notes of the gong that sum-
moned the beggars to their evening rice
they gobbled their food in silence there-
after for a while they lay resting grate-
ful to milo fo for the small blessing of
food that he had bestowed

the clang of an alarm-clock aroused
the assemblage the evening lot-
tery   the beggars gathered at a table
that stood near the west wall of the room
one by one upon this table they laid the
trophies of human sympathy that they
had collected through the daylight hours

  for a moment cheng lin contemplated
holding out the three gold-pieces that he
had found then obeying an obvious
principle of right conduct he dropped
the gold on the table together with a
handful of brass cash

cheng tiins journey to the const
at times became a running fight
ohen
  rewarding virtue the tumbling dice of
the lottery marked cheng lin as the ob-
ject of kwan yins smile a fortunate
throw brought him half of the total prof-
its of the day he counted the money

  something over thirty dollars in sil-
ver he announced he bought three
bottles of black wine for the company
and while his companions enjoyed this
he accepted an invitation to a night of
pleasure with a beggar soon yut who
had been fortunate in the previous nights
lottery and who still retained half the
money he had won

  starting out i suggest the pavilion of
delight in blood alley soon yut of-
fered large pleasures can be enjoyed
there for small cash

  in the pavilion of delight after his
third cup of wine cheng lin joined the
players at a fan-tan table within the
hour he had won eight hundred dollars

  hola soon yut exulted proud of
his companions success a big chicken
does not eat small rice you still enjoy
the smile of kwan yin-why waste your
time here

 a wise man understands a nod
cheng lin agreed where shall we go
i have heard of large games in the
paris club soon yut advised

  they wroiild not admit us cheng lin
protested

  the world smiles upon a rich man
soon yut said even an emperor wel-
comes a rich man

  let us go there

  the paris club was thronged with a
mixed company of asiatics and euro-
peans-officers of six armies navy men
white russians and a miscellany of
french and english and american busi-
ness men at a roulette-table cheng lin
sought his companions advice

  what number do you say

 one soon yut answered one-
yourself against the world

hat number did you say  cheng
lin asked for the moment it
seemed that he had been hypnotized by
the beauty of the hinds of a girl across
the roulette-table she was a white rus-
sian on whom strangely enough the
battle of life had left no visible scars

  one soon yut repeated are you
deaf

  observe the beauty of that womans
hands cheng lin suggested he bought
a stack of ten-dollar chips and set ten of
them on the number one she has the
most beautiful hands in the world he

continued curves more graceful than
the flowing branches of the dwarfed wil-
low wherein the sunbird chong-

  watch the game soon yut admon-
ished as the whirling ball slowed to click
against the metal fins of the wheel then
exulting in his vicarious luck number
one you win

  i win cheng lin agreed quietly
we will play the number again to the
dealer what is the limit of play
your bet is the limit bet the dealer
said pushing thirty-five yellow chips
toward cheng lin there you are--
thirty-five hundred dollars

an hour before dawn the burning pain
 in cheng lins wounded shoulder
became unbearable he called for opium
with the relief that came to him after he
had swallowed a pill of good black malwa
gum his thoughts and his desires concen-
trated on the beauty of the white rus-
sians hands

  what would that girl cost  he asked
soon yut

  the prices on these slaves have ranged
from ten dollars up soon yut said
she is an exceptional specimen but
why should you give any thought to her
purchase price you are wealthy
cheng lin nodded yes i have won
more than thirty thousand dollars to-
night invite her to join us

  an hour after the midday sun burned
down upon the twisted corpses that still
lay along blue hill road cheng lin had
leased a house on empire avenue to-
gether with its furnishings and its serv-
ants in the courtyard of the house was
a willow tree of pleasing curves wherein
a dozen birds of brilliant plumage did
their best to compensate cheng lin for
the loss of his sunbird chong they sang
in vain for his ears were deaf to their
song and his eyes were blind to their
brilliance beauty lay only in the curves
of the white russians hands the girl
had become the queen of cheng lins
heart   

  before half of cheng lins money had
been spent he had received a dozen of-
fers for olga to the various emissaries
of the captains of commerce and the sev-
eral minor warlords who had desired the
white russian girl chengs invariable
reply was a refusal of their offers to
the agent of the great general fang
hung i do not wish to sell the girl
cheng lin said

  general fangs gratitude would make
you rich permit me to advise you to
present the white russian to general
fang with your compliments

  with considerable courage these war-
lords have cost me too much happiness
cheng lin answered thinking of the raid
that had brought death to the sunbird
chong

  following this there came an invita-
tion to cheng lin to attend a banquet at
general fangs headquarters after too
much wine had been served the general
sought cheng lin

  i thank you for the honor you have
done me by being my guest tonight the
general said how does it happen that
commerce instead of war engages your
brilliant mind

  i have had small experience in the art
of military combat cheng lin ex-
plained

  general fang nodded his understand-
ing it is true that a peaceful court-
yard is to be preferred to a soldiers
camp he said scholars are the na-
tions treasure-but you have had some
experience in war

  four years in the armies of the south
cheng lin admitted

  general fang hesitated a moment and
then he said i have a mission for you
in a province to the north you will re-
port to my headquarters at midday
your credentials and your orders will be
ready for you

  cheng lin realized that from this there
was no escape

  late in the afternoon of the following
day i must leave you for a while he

said to olga my heart is heavy gen-
eral fang has ordered me to go north
into the province of shensi and there is
no escape

  i can go with you olga said i
have known hardships worse than you
will encounter on the way

impossible cheng lin said you
 will remain here in my house let
your heart be light there is wealth
enough in this venture to keep us in lux-
ury for a hundred years when i return
we will escape to some sanctuary where
we can enjoy perpetual happiness here
with the fires of war around us the blood
of my people flowing in the streets there
is no happiness

  we can escape tonight you and i
the russian girl insisted

  you and i are-prominent people
cheng lin said bitterly fearing that ol-
gas beauty had marked them both for
destruction we bear fangs brand
with an escort of a hundred soldiers
cheng lin began his march to the an-
cient capital in sianfu by arrangement
with the provincial governor his force
was increased by a thousand soldiers
these veterans will guard the treasure
from here to the coast the governor sai
general fang will provide for them after
that they are good soldiers but they
have eaten us poor

  the treasure which was to be carried
to the coast was a thousand chests of
opium this venture will make us rich
the governor declared

   i have no financial interest in the af-
fair cheng lin protested

  general fang will gain more than
three million dollars if you are successful
do you imagine that you will go unre-
warded if the opium market holds
your treasure may be worth five millions
if you encounter opposition be merciless
kill as you go

  cheng lins journey to the coast at
times became a running fight nearing
the city he felt a growing impatience to
be done with the job he dreamed of the
white russian girl hatred for general
fang flamed in his heart wealth could
buy a hundred other women as fair as
olga but cheng lin knew that all the
treasure of china could not regain the
lost happiness he knew instinctively
that olga would never again belong to
hinij and he charged this loss to general
fang

  twenty miles from the gates of the
city a courier met him with orders bear-
ing the generals seal the orders had
been written on the eve of fangs de-
parture to join the military council of
the north they covered the disposal of
the opium that cheng lin and his com-
mand had convoyed from shansi and
contained instructions carelessly explic-
it relative to the money which cheng
lin would receive for the generals ac-
count in payment for the illicit cargo

  three million dollars was the specific
sum that general iang had required as
his minimum share in the enterprise
on the day that cheng lin entered the
city the price of opium was up and he
finished the transaction with a personal
jfrofit of more than a million dollars

  he began forthwith a search for olga
his inquiries revealed that she had lived
for a while in general fangs residence
she had not gone north with the general
-that much he discovered but there-
after her fate was a mystery

  without much ceremony and with some
small problems solved by the use of mi-
nor bribes cheng lin got out of the
army but after that he could not escape
the complex responsibilities that his
wealth imposed there were a hundred
servants in his house now and his court-
yard was forever brilliant with the ban-
ners of messengers and agents of other
important men while the war raged
every enterprise of purchase and sale
meant profit and within the year cheng
lin was recognized as a member of the
inner circle of merchant princes whose
traffic in the stuffs of war had made them
millionaires

  his house was now a palace of a hun-
dred rooms and in his wide courtyard
fifty graceful willows ranged about an
emerald lake whose boundary was a
gleaming parapet of white marble his
army uniforms had given place to volu-
minous robes of brocaded silk the
new costumes were comfortable enough

save for the fact that cheng lins con-
fidential business affairs imposed the nec-
essity of carrying a bulky private ledger
wherein were secret records of his more
important transactions

  the volume was a nuisance but its
corners were not so sharp as the angular
keys of steel and brass that opened a
dozen vaults these vaults held other
ledgers and other record-books and treas-
ures of gold coin for use in commercial
emergencies where ready money often
meant double profit cheng lins brief
military experience had taught him the
advantages of traffic in arms and am-
munition in food and uniforms for a mil-
lion men in tanks and planes he car-
ried the keys of his treasure-vault in the
left sleeve of his robe and they were
bound to his wrist by a silken cord
braided around a fine steel chain
through his waking hours and through
increasingly briefer stretches of his
troubled sleep the keys were with him
the bulky ledger that held the secrets
of his wealth was carried in an oiled silk
pouch beneath his outer robe

for important but annoying reasons
it had become advisable for him to car-
ry a heavy automatic pistol in a shoulder
holster under his left armpit day and
night these possessions never left him
they were symbols of his status-essen-
tial tools of his vocation there had been
brief moments at first when he had hated
the weight and bulk of these incum-
brances he accepted them now as nec-
essary evils

  cheng lin had fattened on rich food
until his girth was almost equal to that
of general fang his private chairs had
been widened and his chair at the head
of the long table in his banquet hall was
as wide as an emperors throne

  on a night when the silver crescent of
the seventh moon had gorged on the star
 rice in the western sky cheng lin sat
 in his banquet hall with a varied com-
 pany about the table were minor dip-
 lomats of eight foreign powers a dozen
 agents of munitions firms various ladies
 from the european settlements and a
 group of millionaire chinese who had
 been associated with the host in profit-
 able business ventures

   for his guests entertainment there was
 music and presently dancing and cards
 with roulette for those who elected to
 gamble in a darkened room a cinema
 projected the latest news-reels from
 abroad

   the news-reel flashed a gray tragedy
 of a luxury liner breaking on a reef of the
 southern seas a new dictator bowed to
 a turbulent mob in central europe a
 bowlegged pole-vaulter cleared the bar
 at fourteen feet a fat woman whose
 teeth needed fixing held a mop in her left
 hand and in her right a check for eighty
 thousand dollars that she had won in the
 sweepstakes then smiling at a horde
 of ten thousand admirers who blocked the
 traffic in front of a great london hotel
 cheng lin and his companions saw olga
 saratov

   she was vera latovna now and fame
 and fortune had come to her in holly-
 wood while cheng lins eyes devoured
 his lost one the girl laid her lovely hands
 above her heart her fingertips sought
 her lips and then the vision faded

   cheng lins heart was still for three
 seconds a surge of blood born of an

  emotion beyond his control throbbed in
  his veins the impact of his distress
  blinded him for a moment a tropical
  volcano devastating its little world re-
  placed the scene that had shaken cheng
  lin speaking with difficulty to one of
  his chinese companions beside him
  cheng lin said  you will excuse me for
  a little while explain to our guests
  that i will return presently

    he walked out of the darkened room
  and turned to the left seeking the sanc-
  tuary of his private apartment to a
  servant in the hallway your arm he
  demanded my legs are strangely weak
  aid me to my room

    on his bed cheng lin rested at first
  on his right side the bulky ledger in
  its oiled silk case annoyed him with
  evident effort he rolled to his left side
  but now the heavy angular keys chained
  to his left wrist were spears against his
  heart the pistol in its shoulder holster
  under his left armpit made his present
  posture impossible he struggled to his
  feet groaning

    a servant bowed low before him the
  general fang hung presents ten thou-
  sand felicitations--and desires to see
  you the servant said

    cheng lin frowned after a momeflt
  with a sudden savage energy in his voice
  bring him here he commanded

    when general fang hung stood before
  him cheng lin blinked his eyes in as-
  tonishment where are the insignia of
  your exalted rank he asked

    stripped from me by the general
  staff fang hung admitted reluctantly
  i am no longer a general i am no bet-
  ter than a beggar i beseech your aid
  the gods of disaster have claimed me for
  their victim traitors on my staff de-
  stroyed me

    enough of this recital cheng lin
  said he turned to a servant bring
  us wine

  with a brimming glass lifted toward
  fang hung i drink to the gods of
  disaster observed cheng lin they
  have served me well    what of the
  russian girl whose hands held all the
  beauty under heaven confess 

    fang hung gulped his wine she was
  in my palace for a while he admitted
  she surrendered later to a foreign devil
  from the great city where moving pictures
  are made i know that she sailed on the
  ship with him and-

    enough cheng lin ordered be
  silent his face contorted with rage


mirrored the burning hatred for fang
hung that filled his heart this passed
evenly then he said the eyes of the
blind need no ointment only a dead
snake is straight who am i to question
the will of heaven 

  he called for writing materials there-
after for three minutes scowling at fang
hung he affixed his signature and his
seal stamped in vermilion ink to ten
blank sheets of paper he tossed them to
fang hung

  write what you will above my name
he said with a savage strength he broke
the thin steel chain from about his wrist
and tossed the keys to fang hung you
will need these he said the bulky
ledger of cheng lins private enterprises
followed the keys this will guide you
to ten million dollars my fortune is
yours he ripped the heavy automatic
and its holster from its place under his
left arm and this you will need this 

fang hung looked blankly at cheng
lin what is ail this he asked
again

  cheng lin scowled at his questioner
i give you all of my wealth he snarled
all of my possessions save one you
carpe to me just now as a suppliant for
some trifling favor-and you receive my
material estate

  after a moment of silence give me
your coat cheng lin demanded he
threw his silken robes aside your coat
is ragged enough to serve my present pur-
pose he poured another glass of wine
for himself alone he lifted the glass
toward fang hung i drink to the day
when you will suffer the torture that
wealth can bring

  with fang hungs shabby coat about
him cheng lin made his way toward the
obscure crooked alley behind the serv-
ants quarters of his courtyard in the
dark night a mongrel throng of fifty hun-
gry men waited here he shouldered his
way unrecognized through this pack of
derelict humanity and turned toward the
house of the beggars guild

  midway of his journey his lagging
steps quickened the ponderous burden
that had crushed his heart was lifted
water for my thirst coarse rice for my
food my bended arm for a pillow-that is
happiness    heaven smiles upon the
resourceful man

  at the doorway of the double blessing
bazaar where caged birds were sold he

spent one gold coin that he had saved
from the heavy purse in the sleeve of his
discarded silken robe

  a sunbird he demanded of the dou-
ble blessing proprietor a sunbird of
resplendent plumage whose song is sweet
at sunrise a sunbird and a fitting cage
from whose earthen floor may grow a
dwarfed willow-a willow tree with
drooping branches more graceful than
the curves of a womans hands

  a cup of warming wine against the
chill of dawn the proprietor of the
double blessing inquired see the
eastern sky is gray

  long life plenteous years cheng
lin said bowing over his wine

  the proprietor of the double blessing
drank to cheng lin i hope that you
will enjoy wealth and power in the favor
of kwan yin he said

  cheng lin smiled i have regained
the middle pathway he returned his
brow had lost its heavy furrows and
tranquil contentment lay cool within his
eyes

   carrying his caged sunbird he left the
double blessing and turned toward the
house of the beggars guild on the way
without the bribery of millet grains
greeting the morning light the sunbird
voiced his tribute to the dawn with a
measure of melody that made an appro-
priate overture for the song in cheng
lins heart

yu flawed

          ay in deptford village and
the moon at full above the
gray spire of st nicholas
her silver light floated down
warmly caressing many a corpse-face
rolling past in the wide river roses
were in the air for june lay upon the
morrow but upstream over london
rested the quivering horror of the plague

  here in the tavern garden a long board
was set with cloth and glass candles un-
flickering under the rose-arbor the wide
thames glinting radiant beyond a
motley throng sat at this table with a
fair genial man at one end he had a

laughing face a jovial face but reckless
indeed a reckless and godless man was
kit marlowe and worse

  at the other end of the board sat the
lone woman of the party a radiant lass
in a neat but common gown broken
shoes and a necklace of flowers about
her throat in her features lay a forced
folly a desperate laughter under the
lurking fright was a piercing sweetness
and tenderness even in the moonlight
her fresh-washed wealth of hair was like
massy gold

  marlowe who had begun to drink
heavily lifted his goblet
 tomorrow brings june and more
roses for deptford he cried blithely
therefore-more wine for me and a
toast to the blessed damsel who queens
our board  

  a burst of voices rang applause how
be she named  bawled someone

  marlowes gaze swept the company
with a touch of scorn

  a pretty face needs no name and
brooks no questions we be merchants
clerks gentry and god knows what
gathered here in hasty flight from lon-
don town if queen bess be fled from
court heres queen cicely to seek our
homage cicely royal salutations 

  laughter rose and coarse jests ras-
cal or gentleman lackey or soldier all
these had fled from the terror that stalked
through london under shadow of the
plague a rogue with money was good as
any lord and could drink as deep one
man however spoke out at marlowe he
was a man in black a fvirtive snarling fig-
ure with angry brooding eyes

  so youre master marlowe the poet
the agnostic the man who denies god
and heaven 

  or hell added marlowe with a roar-
ing laugh

 ive heard of you and no good
neither

this fourth story in the series the
world was their stage brings in
the picturesque and tragic figure of
christopher marlowe

by h bedford-jones

illustrated by raymond sisley


so youre master
marlowe the poet
the agnostic the man
who tieuies heaven

  thats more than i can say of you
who sit at my board and revile me
whats your name if you were be-
queathed one by any lawful sire
richard bame clerk of cheapside
am i and no godless runagate

  marlowe a spark in his eyes was
about to reply when the server came and
whispered at his ear instantly he for-
got bame and his fist crashed on the
board

vo castiliano bring
him here quickly and set a place look
you friends-heres dick tarleton of
my lord chamberains company come
to seek me drollest of all players
most perfect of all fools the rarest thing
in the whole wide vwld a loyal heart
marlowe leaped up hands outstretched
as tarleton approached

come to our hearts you divine
rogue   he went on gustily not a man
here ever heard o players or poets to
the lot of em fames but a jade stamped
in gold or siller but heres a lass to
raise an ache in your heart cicely
fair queen this be dick tarleton of the
sober brain and the true spirit 

tarleton came to the table he
was a quiet young fellow with a rug-
ged mobile face than could screw into fan-
tastic shapes but it was grave enough
now he flung off his riding-cloak and
swept the lady an exaggerated reverence

straightening he gave her a second
and sharper glance and bowed to the
boisterous greetings of the company he
looked once again at cicely before he
turned and caught the arm of the poet

kit come aside for a moment or
two he said the server was setting a
place and bringing a chair ive pri-
vate word for you art drunk

impossible   marlowe arm in arm
with him swung away down the shell-
edged garden path should know me
better than to suspect such a thing
dick

who the devil are these people
how the devil should i know they
straggled in during the day fugitives
from london but the lass-ah dick
the lass is a jewel a gem o samarkand
a very pearl of araby she was trudg-
ing at a cart-tail  had her bathed and
dressed who bah the only name

i	know is cicely i bade em all to dine
with me and here we be

then theyre not friends of yours
marlowe laughed under this terror
dick names and friends are all forgot
man wants only liquor and somewhither
to flee escape for mind and body thats
the cry i find it rare good fun these
prating cowards clerks and gentry and
merchants-faugh one but plays with
them 

  youve fallen into your satanic mood
have you said tarleton years ago
ben jonson called you the kindest heart
alive and that was years ago when
you were young and the royalest of
friends-

  pox take you dick a sermon
burst in marlowe fleeringly

  no an errand ive money for you
to squander on that feckless trull-
careful lad marlowe halted and
his voice bore warning i said the lass
is a jewel and so she is and hath within
her something rarely noble some quality
delicate and fragile that leaps to ones
soul youll see within the hour youll
be her slave well well no more of
this you bring news 

  aye from ned alleyn hes off with
a company o players to bristol and the
west country he left a purse with me
saying it was a debt he owed you ive
had no chance to-bring it until now
tarleton produced a purse the poet
took it and pocketed it

  rare ned alleyn  wilt ever forget
hfm in my tamburlaine the lordliest
presence of them all what news from
your own company is ben jonson i
the city

  hes gone everyones gone scattered
in mad flight said tarleton will
shakespeare and his brother are gone-
they would be gone marlowe broke
in sourly i never liked that fellow
dick is it true that you and the other
players swore an oath after that first
play was writ for him by another man
never to reveal the secret

  kit kit would you trick me
tarleton asked reproachfully if i ad-
mitted any such oath youd know all
youre not a player but a writer i
cant let you into what is after all a
secret of the profession

  thats answer enough laughed mar-
lowe and he clapped tarleton on the
shoulder old friend its a sorry busi-
ness when the clink o siller enters into
the making of plays when oaths are
sworn when a rogite is exalted into a
great man upon pretense wthen a cheap
and petty brain hangs upon the repute
of a great and noble brain-

  kit forget all this youve been
drinking cut in tarleton abruptly
and i must be off im riding on to

  looc up my married sister in gravesend
and stop with her

  nonsense lad youll bide here
with me

  only for a bite and a sup art doing
a new play 

  i was but am no longer marlowe
looked back at the candles and the com-
pany his fair eager face was curiously
twisted in the moonlight the gentle
kindness of it stood out strangely and
strikingly so did the dark and terrible
evil of it as he went on 

  shes been here two hours dick and
the worlds different i know nothing
of her yet i know everything shes the
most rare and delicate creature alive
ive no more than brushed her lips with
my fingers-

  good god man are you serious
exclaimed the other you the foremost
poet in england the genius of us all
greater than jonson himself-struck mad
by a bankside wench  i know her face
at least cant remember where i saw
her some light-o-love

  marlowe put an arm about tarletons
shoulders and shook his head smiling
gently

  lad im close to thirty and in my
time have looked up more than one lane
what counts most is not what has been
but what is reality takes a different
aspect under the wings o death dick
you dont know her-

he broke off abruptly looking back
t the table the boisterous mirth
had fallen silent forms were stealing
off into the darkness the company one
by one were leaving the half-eaten feast

  they fear you dick said marlowe
soberly youre just from london and
the terror of the plague is on them
then ill go-

  silent youll not im glad your
coming has rid me of them after all
the quicker the devil takes the lot the
better look you lad ive a new
argument in regard to that book which
they call the bible-

  for shame kit tarleton swung
upon him with abrupt anger now i
know youre drunk and the devil in you
sober youre a poet a dear fellow loved
by all the world liquor makes you a
rascal a sorry blackguard a blasphem-
ing loutish crafty fiend planning evil
to all around   oh kit kit the
comedians voice broke with sudden ago-
nized appeal will you not see the
truth ere its too late the noblest heart
alive when sober and in liquor a foul
beast plotting harm to everyone 
marlowe broke into a laugh come
lad every man has two men in him
you have a devil for one o them
said tarleton bluntly thats why you
wanted to know about the oath with all
your fine ranting talk about the clink o
siller and so forth youre drunk and
blaspheming and plotting evil its no
secret you who might be so high are
another man when drunk and the foul
fiend himself is in you

  marlowe still laughing caught his
arm come dick back to the board 
as for what ye say this wanton talk
plagues me not ive heard it often and
its not true if i deny god and man
its from conviction not from drunken
folly besides ill drink no more this
night upon my honor nor perhaps
tomorrow neither-tomorrow and tomor-
row  honor bound

  good if ye mean it no more wine
tonight upon your honor  

they came back to the table and the
candles of the entire company only
cicely remained and two men one was
richard bame of the angry eyes the
other sat at cicelys right hand he
was over-dressed with a fur-trimmed
tabard green silk doublet rich lace at
throat and wrist and a profusion of gold
chains and jewels his features were
smooth and strong but his eyes were
deep smoldering dangerous

  so fear hath spoiled the supper for
all save us- began marlowe the
scowling man bame came to his feet

and your blasphemies have spoiled it
for me said he dourly good night
he went striding away dick tarle-
ton took the place prepared for him and
began the meal hungrily

  marlowe stood looking at the man be-
side cicely

  well good stranger  neither fear
nor blasphemy can spoil your meat
the other shook his head ive
supped wi the devil before this

  youre flattering marlowe said
dryly how shall we name you 
francis replied the other a sim-
ple country gentleman my lord

  lord me not ye fool snapped mar-
lowe a snarl showed in him all at
once the fine gentleness was gone from
his face for a moment it showed the
stamp of a diabolic sneering fury then
this passed and marlowe shrugged and
smiled again

  to me every pcet is a lord said
francis calmly he gave cicely a side-
long glance if there were no fear in his
eyes there was suddenly no lack of it
in hers having paid a full two shil-
lings for upper stalls to enjoy more than
one of your plays may i not worship
here free and gladly at your shrine
marlowe looked at him a fulsome
rogue and i think a lying one said he
calmly then pulled out his chair and sat
down and fell to meat

  francis showed no offense but smiled
and spoke under his breath with cicely
dick tarleton glanced from one to
another and ate and spared no wine
marlowe not touching his cup looked
up as francis addressed him

  master marlowe will ye drink a
health with me

  i will not said kit marlowe curtly
im drinking no more wine this night
dick wilt go out on the water with me
and cicely later  full moon the river
and a boat to be had-you shall prick
n liifp tlirk 

  not i said tarleton when my
horse is baited im for gravesend hm 
master francis and good mistress cice-
ly weve met before this the francis
tongue hath a touch of yorkshire tha
rings familiar

  not to my knowledge said francis
lightly and tarleton knew it for a lie
but when he glanced at cicely she
smiled and nodded to him a twinkle in
her eye

  ive seen you often at the theater
you and kemp the tragedian were with
master burbage the day i spoke with
him

 ha by the saints i remember
now tarleton laid down his knife and
stared it came to him how fair she
was another sweet caught in the devilish
net of kit marlowe-a net apparently all
tenderness and nobility but with satan
grinning at the drawstrings

a ye i remember now went on
tarleton you wanted to play a
part kit thats the truth-she wanted
to play a womans part i swear it
who has ever heard the like

  its no such nonsense as you seem to
think protested cicely quickly why
shouldnt women be players too why
should womens parts always be played
by boys thats the real nonsense
marlowe leaned forward his eyes
warm the liquor was dying out of him
now as tarleton could see


once a hand shot
out of the water
as though point-
ing at them

    so you want to play on
  the stage  he said to cic-
  ely i think itd be mar-
  velous all the better that
  its never been done and
  you came to diccon and he
  hemmed and hawed and
  put you off-good old bur-
  iaage gad i can just see
  him must have outraged
  him to the soul-the very
  idea of a woman on the
  stage 

     he slapped his thigh and
  roared tarleton laughed
  cicely smiled but fran-
  cis sat with his gray eyes
  on marlowe giving no
  sign of any emotion

      should like to try it
   said cicely and sighed a
   little i know i could do
   it

     she was fair and slim a
  slender girl but well bud-
  ded her hair like spun
  silk her face wide and
  lovely to see for all the
  look that sat in the blue
  eyes tarleton regarded
  her with open interest
  now and his heart leaped
  to the meeting of eyes for
  she was gazing straight at
  him

    you shall have the
  chance spoke up mar-
  lowe i swear it lass
  tarleton lad why not do
  a bit with her a snatch
  of my edward second--
  see how it might run on
  her tongue

    cicely looked at dick
  tarleton and his heart
  scurried again

we - we could not
here i  the garden said he
too many folk about it
would cause great scandal
 were it known

    scandal enough with-
  out it spoke up francis
  a certain unctuous pleas-
  ure in his colorless voice
  master bame hath gone


to lay complaint of blasphemy against
poor kit marlowe says he that a man
should so talk against god is sheer law-
less rascality and the talker an outlaw or
should be

  tarleton looked again at the man and
could make nothing of him except some
vaguely familiar hint a queer impas-
sive man young enough but something
grim in his eyes of agate-gray

  why well take to the water  said
marlowe a barge with rowers a lute
for you dick and for me as well queen
cicely to sit enthroned as we float-and
you sir fop with your gold chains and
talk of outlawry will you accompany
us 

  thanks ill to bed said francis
but not my talk of outlawry mind you 
that was bames doing outlaw you
may be master kit in godly eyes in all
decent eyes-outlaw and a foul beastly
thing in shape of man however thats
naught of my affair and ill wager all
my golden chains against your belt and
dagger that i can drink you under the
table in an hours time

  done cried marlowe evidently be-
tween laughter and fury this smooth
way ofj hurling insults in his teeth and
smiling them away baffled him stay
not now though ive sworn to touch
no more wine tonight tomorrow noon
lets say 

  aye tomorrow noon francis rose
and bent over the hand of cicely with a
bow of castilian grace fair queen
make the most of your poet by this silver
moon for hell be too drunk to see it
tomorrow night 

  he swaggered away into the darkness
and was gone toward the tavern mar-
lowe turned to dick tarleton and be-
sought him to stay the night the
player looking past marlowes cheek
met the gaze of cicely

  stay  said her eyes and her face
confirmed the word

  why then said tarleton ill stay
kit since youre drinking no wine for
love o me the least i can do is to play
up to you 

marlowe shouted for the landlord
got a bed put in his room for tarle-
ton arranged about the players horse
and secured a barge and oarsmen he
flung away toward the tavern in search
of his own lute dick tarleton found
himself alone with cicely

  quickly  he said to her his eyes
urgent whats he to you

  whether it were the candles or the
moonlight color rose in her cheeks

  nothing she said bitterly but how
can i help it if he wants me he must
have me ive no choice all my world
was wiped out by the sickness i cant
earn my bread by singing madrigals and
playing the lute

  you dont know him tarleton said
hotly see him in liquor before you
decide the poet then becomes a raven-
ing beast-crafty elemental brutish
those who loved him have turned from
him his friends warn others against
him as i warn you

  perhaps he needs me said she

  no i need you tarleton rejoined
and looked into he eyes

and you call yourself his friend
her voice held a hint of scorn
god forbid  id save him if i could
no one can said tarleton the nobler
part in kit recognizes your worth and
loveliness the devil in him will debase
and kill you he has done this to others
there was a lass only a year ago-a
certain mistress anne-who died because
she thought he was an angel and found
otherwise indeed it is no secret how
liquor makes this frightful change in
him as it has changed his whole life
but im staying until the morrow be-
cause of what i read in your face and
because of what my heart tells me

  she laughed in faint derision

  a play-actor who misses no chance at
a light-o-love eh 

  shame to you for those words said
tarleton quietly a flicker of the can-
dles brought out the grave earnest lines
of his face she leaned forward sud-
denly contrite

  im sorry indeed i am but who am
i nothing a toy for men i must
fight all you men-him and you and
that one who was here last-

  you dont have to fight broke in
tarleton instead trust fight the
others trust me keep that thought
in your mind who was that fellow last
here that francis a liar by the feel
of him you know him

  no she said but he frightened
me there was some terrible thing in
him-a deadly hatred perhaps i could
feel it just as i feel faith and kindliness
in you

  tarleton grunted and what feel
you in kit

  fascination and-and fear she said
something wonderful yet terrible


his ranting words stopped at nothing  in the
midst of it sir francis did what he had come to do

  keep your feelings to yourself unless
you want to burn for a witch he said
quickly above all trust not kit with
such words a stoup of wine or two and
hed scheme to see you burned here
he comes tomorrow say the word and
ill face him down and take you away
to my sister in gravesend and ill ask
naught in return

  kit marlowe came with a laugh and a
gleeful shout he swept them up in his
impetuous way and all three hastened
down the paths to the river where a

barge with four rowers was now waiting
at the landing

  cicely took the lute from marlowe and
pricked it deftly never was kit more
charming more merrily debonair he
sang his own songs and cicely sang and
dick tarleton did a bit or two in charac-
ter until his clowning set them in a gale
of laughter then the boatmen were
roused to song likewise what with brown
ale and marlowes urging and took up
the old saxon drinking catch with its
silly rhymes
the blue book magazine

take a deep deep draft ami think of how
        we laughed

when the tankard fell adown on the fat old
         abbots crown   

so drink your fill of the beery rill
and then go down in motley

  thus all made merry on the silvery
radiant tide wherein every now and again
flashed a white and horrible face rolling
down in deathly wise to the sea once a
hand shot out of the water as though
pointing at them this made cicely cry
out and cover her eyes but kit marlowe
only hummed another catch

    he who devils this devil around
    the fitter the saint will be

  not a half bad philosophy whether
applied to a bottle or a loose habit  ex-
claimed tarleton laughing ill apply it
to the virginia tobacco and never smoke
another pipe kit provided youll do the
samp with the bottle eh

	avaunt tempter  marlowe clapped
him jovially on the shoulder ill do
nothing of the sort what abandon good
liquor never while i live lad-never
later when the lass had drifted off to
sleep and the rowers were heading back
to the deptford landing tarleton touched
the poets arm and spoke very softly

  ye saw the corpse-hand pointing kit 
look now maybe to you it was point-
inar in warning try none of your tricks
with cicely

  marlowe stared at him in the high
moonlight

  my tricks you dare to speak thus
think of anne shipley kit with her
death ye lost your last friends ive hung
on longer than most but now its ended
ill take this lass from you if i can so
theres fair warning

  the poet took a deep breath and
laughed a little

  why dick i could love ye for those
words loved i not this fine fellow tarle-
ton already  so youre taken with her 
i am also ill not let ye catch her away
from me and theres fair warning back
at you but you and i are friends can
win and lose like friends and no need o
swordplay

  he put out his hand and tarleton
gripped it

  well said kit and truly meant he
answered sadly but god save us if you
start drinking again tomorrow then ill
to sword if i must for her sake

  and you who this same evening called
her a feckless trull  chuckled marlowe

  true my eyes hadnt been opened
tarleton admitted simply something in
her has gone straight to my soul as it has
to yours ah kit id give her up gladly
could you but have faith and all the high
nobility of your genius-

  stop whining like an old woman
broke in the poet roughly i believe in
nothing beyond what i see and hear and
feel thats plenty too genius tommy-
rot lad away with all that nonsense
had i not desired to keep my oath to you
id be roaring merry this moment in-
stead of going home with a sad heart and
evil presages

  evil presages on such a night  heav-
en forbid exclaimed tarleton com-
fortably ive seen none and felt none
unless it were that hand rising from the
water and pointing by the way who is
that man with the queer eyes-that fel-
low francis

  who knows or cares retorted mar-
lowe dick youve given me straight
true words i thank you for em now
wake the lass and ask her choice if shell
have you take her and begone with my
blessing

  not so tarleton objected sleep
on it kit if im o the same mind re-
garding her in the morning ill take you
at your word

so they came back to the tavern and
stumbled up to bed marlowe was
snoring in no time but dick tarleton
lay staring upon i he moonlit window
sleep evading him

  he was under no illusions about the
splendid brawny marlowe the genius
whose young thunderous voice had rung
through england the poet was not yet
thirty but for the past two or three years
had been more and more silent as the
frightful change crept upon his life that
generous noble spirit had been gradually
gnawed away until now the mere breath
of alcohol wakened a malignant flame in
the man   

  wakening tarleton found himself
alone in the room he dressed and went
down to the inn-yard pump discovering
that marlowe had gone to the river with
some townsfolk in order to see some great
ship newly anchored there his ablutions
made tarleton went into the ordinary for
his morning draught and was sitting
there over a long pipe when cicely made
her appearance lie rose and they
laughed together in joyous greeting

  you look like a spring primrose
said he presently when she was quaffing
outlawed

her draught of milk tell me cicely
have ye no relatives

  i have nothing the said with a ter-
rible simplicity

  thats not the right sort o talk for a
june morning june is in today lass
he exclaimed nothing you have
everything all i can give you from
name to the silver groat in my pocket
im no roaring gallant of nimble tongue
nor one of the gay careless crew who
have made the stage and all plays a mess
of vileness to the disgust of sober folk
ill take ye as ye take me at face value
and the bid o the heart if you say the
word 

  she smiled as she watched him  it was
a tender wise smile

  master tarleton i do not love you
nor you me but i might i might wilt
give me time to think 

  not under this roof tarleton replied
bluntly kit said to ask you if ye pre-
fer me we go with his blessing need not
stare lass im no liar

  i know that she replied dick
tarleton will you help me to play stage
parts

  no wife o mine shall set foot on the
stage he said firmly lass its a bawdy
plpce bacon and barclay and their ilk
wdl ha none of it for that reason nor
shall you

  some day she said looking out at
the blue sky and the river some day
womans parts will be played by women
and the stage will discover what its
missed all these years

  will ye go home with me to my sister
in gravesend asked tarleton steadily
or stay here with kit

  her eyes came back to him and dwelt
upon his face for a lo ig moment

  you know the answer well she re-
plied at last but ill not sneak out while 
his back is turned

tarleton beamed and reached for
her hand and gripped it warmly
we be of a kind lass you and i go
and pack ill wait here

  pack i have nothing she looked
down at her dress he got me this yes-
terday

  then well get my horse saddled and
another for you and be ready to go when
he comes back if that suits you dont
remain long enough for drink to get into
him

  it suits me she assented gravely

  he gave the orders hiring a horse for
cicely they werealking together when

one came from the upstairs and joined
them with a cheery greeting it was fran-
cis his eyes gray and chid as ever they
exchanged a few words and as he went
out to put his head under the pump
cicely looked after him

  i know now-i remember  she ex-
claimed i knew id seen him some-
where he was with the earl of mont-
gomerys following a gentleman of his
someone pointed him out to me for he
and the earl were arm in arm and most
handsomely dressed this was at the
revels last twelfth night

  aye queried tarleton in amaze-
ment this agate-eye a great gentle-
man and his name

  she shook her head i cant mind it
now but i vow hes the same man ah
there he comes-look  

but she spoke not of francis now but
of marlowe who came swinging and
swaggering in from the open to stand
blinking at the dark room and then cross
to where they sat

  he greeted cicely as though she were
queen bess in person then met the eye
of tarleton and came erect under that
steady unflinching regard

  what dick said he ye look at
me mortal hard whats to do

  this kit tarleton said quietly
cicely desires to go with me the
horses are rfeady we waited to face you
with it

  marlowes features changed twisted
became suffused with blood then paled
again his eyes gripped cicely with an
expression of dismay he found fum-
bling words

  why little lass would ye leave me
it was only yesterday i came kit
she said gently

  but i cant lose you like this he
cried out its impossible you must
stay 

  i will stay for a while on one condi-
tion she told him provided you touch
no drop of any liquor kit

  absurd that i should let you in-
jure me condition this and that prove
your unfaith by promises of faith as
to a child  marlowe said with a burst
of anger almost at once it passed and
he drew a deep breath like a sigh well
i found a precious thing and it slipped
from my hand he said slowly go
with her dick art a loyal man how
rarely lucky are they that have not spirit
to plunge into the justs of life my bless-
ing follow after u cicely
the blue book magazine

  with this queer speech he turned from
them strode out into the courtyard and
when the two followed he was standing
in hearty greeting with the man francis
they mounted and marlowe waved
heartily to them and francis bowed with
the grace of one trained in courts

  they rode out of the inn yard and out
of deptford taking the downstream road
for gravesend high twelve came and
passed again they stopped to eat bread
and cheese under the shadow of a haw-
thorn hedge and there spoke of kit for
the first time

  it was nobly done of him said tarle-
ton gravely

  she nodded

 yes he might have said many
things i expected him to upbraid me
and if he had begged me dick i must
have stayed a while for very decency
toward him

  art sorry now queried tarleton

 nay alls well with the june
world she said brightly better here
than there with the cold gray eyes of sir
ralph eating into me like worms

  who demanded tarleton

  she laughed at his gawking face

  oh sir ralph shipley i just re-
membered his name as we were riding
you know    the man who calls himself
francis

  tarleton sat frozen until an incoherent
cry escaped him he came to his feet
abruptly and his hands were shaking

  shipley shipley  he exclaimed
plunging to catch his horse god of
furies-anne shipleys brother wait
for me here lass-wait for me here-

  he mounted and spurred behind him
lifted the dust of a madmans riding

in the tavern at deptford kit marlowe
sat with francis the two of them
drinking with many a jest and racy
story by little and little marlowe fell
to cursing and blaspheming true he
had never been a man for monkery yet
in the old days when his star rose so
brightly there had been no venom in his
words

  now it was different as the heady wine
took hold of him it was strange al-
most incredible how the temper of the
man changed his ranting words stopped
at nothing and what had been a noble
mind became a pool of vileness

  in the midst of this francis did what
he had come to do then mounted his
horse and rode away

  a little later tarletons foam-lathered
steed came to halt in the inn yard al-
most at once he found he was too late
the host came running to him with news
marlowe was stabbed but not yet dead

  oh sir if ye be a surgeon look to
him quickly  pleaded the innkeeper
there be none roundabout and hell not
let us touch him-

tarleton can e to where the dying
man lay sober now-dreadfully so-
ber-marlowe smiled up at him

  dick lad nay leave my wound
alone ive but a moment or two left

  i came to warn ye babbled tarle-
ton kneeling and holding the chill hand
it was her brother i just learned-
aye so he told me careful lad
speak not the name   marlowes fingers
clenched hard on his let him be known
as francis nothing more swear it to
me swear it let him go unpursued un-
known-after all i was to blame for her
death-swear it 

  dick tarleton swore the oath mar-
lowe sighed and relaxed and smiled again

  well done well done dick he was
a curious man  he said faintly he
would not strike last night as he meant
for i stopped drinking then he hd
to make me drunk dye mind and
why think you fie told me before he
left so he could send me to hell in the
midst o blasphemies  he believes all
that stuff  he wanted to make sure of
landing me in-in hell

  kit marlowe died upon the word   
tarleton did what might be done
which was little enough with the
plague in london and the terror of it
everywhere no one cared whether poet
or great lord or street-beggar lay dead
in a corner lucky was a man to get
burial at all with the thames so close

  however dick tarleton arranged the
burial securing a niche under the gray
walls of st nicholas keeping his oath
to say no word regarding francis he set
out at last his face toward the waiting
cicely and gravesend

  as he rode he wondered within himself
because kit marlowe had died smiling
the cold relaxed face very gentle and
sweet to look upon thus wondering
he rode on a loyal genuine fellow who
happily suffered not from the tortures
and temptings of genius

  and in deptford town lay the poet of
tamburlaine and faustus a voice of
gold forever outlawed and silent

 a brief comedy of
 justice-overheard
 in the jury-room

               i

    in the case of ruth ardlam versus
  james winford ardlam her husband
  judge hale ordered a mistrial and dis-
  missed the jury when juryman john
  purkis was rushed to emergency hospital
  suffering from a minor concussion purkis
  struck his head against the concrete floor
  when his chair tipped backward while the
  jury was deliberating   

now gentlemen lets not get
excited youve got no call
to start hcllering at me again
just because youre too stub-
born to agree with me calling a man
names never was known to change his
mind after hes reasoned things out like i
have

  im the most reasonable party in the
world and- im glad you find some-
thing to laugh at gentlemen itll be
a lot nicer in this jury-room to have you
laughing at john purkis instead of hol-
lering at him

  you see gentlemen ive served on
plenty juries before this do it when-
ever i get a chance besides ive studied
law some bought a book once off a

fellow that needed quick cash so i
know the answers   

  sure i can count mr murphy eleven
to one thats how we stand just like
we been for nineteen hours eleven of
you hell-bent for sending poor defendant
ardlam to jail and me with a little milk
of human kindness wanting him set free

  sure ill explain again mr murphy
though i got my doubts youll ever get
it through your dumb heads this de-
fendant ardlam hes charged with hit-
ting his wife with a rocking-chair

  well if ever a woman needed a punch
on the nose- whats at mr murphy
oh i thought you said something under
your breath i ask you gentlemen have
any of you got wives like this ruth
ardlam the complainant well i have
dead ringer for that female my own
wife is soon as mrs ardlam comes into
court letting on shes scared im sure
glad im on the jury thats trying her
poor husband and when she opens her
mouth i can see shes meaner than a box
of rattlesnakes just like mrs john
purkis accusing always accusing just
like mrs purkis
stubborn

  would you believe i gentlemen if t
take one little drink on my way home
my wife says im drunk just the way
the wife of this poor defendant does
well three or four drinks then if you
got to argue only im not drunk
simply in high spirits like poor ardlam
but what does my wife do she starts
nagging-asking where is my pay-en-
velope just like this ardlam woman
admits she asks too as if its her busi-
ness

  and this woman complaining the way
she did about her poor husband not work-
ing  why he cant find a job i know
im looking for work most of the time
myself in the want ads and she admits
right in open court how she raised hell
with him for using up her hard-earned
money whats she want him to do
starve 

  theres no argument gentlemen if
you had one ounce of sympathy youd
understand why ardlam socks her with
that rocking-chair whats a broken
nose after all hes suffered  she had it
coming if ever-

                                                           i

whats that mr murphy what
do i want  why just this either
you eleven men are going to get some
sense and acquit ardlam or we can stick
around from now on im in no hurry
neither is the judge i know him hell
keep a jury two or three weeks till it fi-
nally gets together no reason to start
groaning gentlemen if youre bound to
be stubborn its up to you

  no sir i dont want a mistrial neither
does this judge he dont like mistrials
never gives one if he possibly can help
it ive looked up his record last time
judge hale declared a mistrial was seven
years ago when a juror got sick after
theyd deliberated fifteen days   

  fifteen days yes sir thats what i
said so if you got businesses to take
care of thats your lookout me i got
all the time in the world stay here a
month if you want    hey murphy
take your foot off my chair almost
tipped me over ill stay here till-
hey-look out im-

    patrick murphy jury foreman said no
  one happened to be looking at juryman
  purkis when he fell only heard him cry
  out as he struck the floor in the excite-
  ment before purkis could be gotten to his
  feet a heavy table also overturned on top
  of him judge hale thanked the other
  jurors and sent them home

ree

     the wild adventure of an
     american merchant crew
     who took sides at narvik

f-hank god they left us the
        cook said mr foyle who
        was or had been second mate

    m did you notice them nazis
come one day ahead of the blizzard
smart work that was and the british- 
ers showed up right in the middle of it
and got hell knocked out of em

  i knew i was a fool to stay with this
ship grunted mcclelland after it got
headed north  i should have quit her at
havre

  foyle chuckled and swept shore and
harbor through his binoculars it was
early morning the fourth day after the
naval blitzkrieg and the blizzard had
struck narvik to make this far northern
port temporarily nazi the blizzard had
raged for three days the shores were
deep with snow

  two british freighters three german
three neutral-they were empty of men
all crews swept ashore when the nazi
destroyers and troopships steamed in
during the blizzard british destroyers
had come and had gone again roughly
handled  that sleek nazi u-boat now ly-
ing on the surface near the destroyers
had done part of the damage at the
enormous iron quay across the harbor
foyle saw two troopships lying and he
heard something that pierced the distant
gunfire drifting from the mountains

  wake up chief  he exclaimed
something coming up  thats why them
troopships have been laying alongside the
quay youre goin to see something

  ive seen too much growled the
chief damn them they smashed our
radio  wish-

  the sound came clearer-the droning
roar of an airplane engine and there was
the plane herself-foyle could see the
nazi emblem on her wings a pursuit-
ship evidently she circled out over the
harbor and headed back

  smart guys said foyle wed ought
to celebrate that chief you and me
could look in the old mans locker he
had some prime bourbon in there the
nazis cleaned him out before he had time
to take anything

  we might put it safe then said the
chief brightening how did you hap-
pen to get left aboard  even if you were
sick as you say-

  oh they didnt know i was sick
broke in foyle only god knew it i
crawled under a boat-cover and nobody
saw me except izzy who crawled in too



and equal
  ill thank ye not to become sacri-
legious said the chief severely as they
headed for the cabin

  a yell from izzy the cook reached
them in the cabin--a yell so pregnant
with alarm with urgency that both men
jumped for the deck as he ran foyle
heard the angry drumming of an airplane
motor-a diving plane

  he emerged at the starboard rail and
stared at the town the tide being on
flood the ship swung so that he had a full
view of narvik opposite the two nazi
troopships were still moored at the mam-
moth iron bridge where the ore-chutes
were over the bay and going fast was a
british plane the nazi machine was
trying to get above it and failing foyle
saw the two dash at each other saw one
of them go tumbling down like a flutter-
ing bird it was the nazi ship done for
crashing near the town

  another yell from izzy echoed by the
chief engineer reached foyle he turned
and dashed for the port rail from here
he had a view of the outer harbor and a
scant stretch of the fiord outside

almost at the harbor entrance two
 destroyers were now racing in shells
were bursting all around them one
yawed wildly and then vanished from
sight in a burst of steam and was gone
the other must have been badly hit the
water-wings fell from her bows and she
lost way gradually swinging around until
she faced the fiord

  crippled by the lord harry   yelled
mcclelland look look 

  his voice shrilled and cracked  no won-
der half a dozen smoke-pouring de-
stroyers edged into view the nazi craft
seemed to break all to pieces but her tor-
pedoes were taking the water she was
dying game under their eyes she be-
came mere bits of wreckage amid spurt-
ing water and was gone

  the town and harbor were in a scream-
ing din of whistles the five nazi de-
stroyers had wakened to mad activity
so did mr foyle suddenly conscious that
all hell was about to break loose here

  look alive he roared at the chief
and izzy we got to get us a boat in the
water so shake a leg

  wait the chief caught his arm
pointing look man look

  the british plane had turned and was
hurtling down from the sky with a wild
roar guns from the destroyers were
spurting at her she came on and on  her
objective was the submarine still on the

surface in midair she suddenly faltered
plunged recovered and went winging
away but things had dropped around
that u-boat the water began to spout
the bombs exploded none made a direct
hit but the submarine was flung almost
clear of the water she settled back and
listed to one side crippled and silent

  the plane went winging out to the
fiord no doubt to some battleship or
cruiser for a heavy smoke was mounting
the sky the nazi destroyers were jet-
ting smoke from their funnels  the troop-
ships by the quay were heading out

  come on come on ordered foyle
anxiously the other two obeyed now
and he led them to the after port boat
one of the two remaining

  the three worked frantically to get the
canvas cover off once a fight started
in this circumscribed bay everything in
sight was going to suffer the nazis had
landed some thousands of troops and had
the prize which was narvik itself where
foyle wanted to get was on this opposite
shore whose scattered houses were all de-
serted and abandoned

  you guys remember that notice the
old man posted up were neutrals he
said

  yah snorted the chief give me j
chance to be anything else and see 
thats so izzy chimed in defiantly
all men are born free and equal aint
they and them nazis wont allow-
neither will i broke in foyle you
pull that free-and-equal stuff aboard ship
and youll have something to remember
it by off the ship thats different make
it stick if you can and more power to you
now get her swung out you pile in izzy
chief if you want to salvage anything
hop after it ill get the instruments
mcclelland departed as though to
hasten him-which it did-a shell came
screaming overhead and burst with a
queer after-clang of iron on iron above
the destroyers shrapnel thought foyle
as he came to his feet and met the sheep-
ish grin of izzy

  straighten out them falls he ordered
ill be right back

  duty pounded at him he gained the
cabins found the skippers instruments
and the rough log then paused beside
the chronometer box was a whacking big
webley automatic pistol and it was full
loaded he dropped it in one pocket a
bottle of bourbon in the other and hur-
ried back to the boat mr mcclelland
was just coming in sight dragging a small
army locker after him
  foyle and the chief got the boat down
safely with izzy in the stern-sheets

  now he began if we got to abandon
ship-wow i

  he and mcclelland went to the deck
together as a wailing scream grew upon
them it passed without rising foyle
lifted himself on his hands and gawked
his eyes bulging

  lookit  gasped the chief lookit 
the nazi submarine lay motionless
but the destroyers had spread out making
an effort to get out of the harbor into the
open fiord too late those gray brit-
ishers were in full sight now and working
their guns but they met trouble one of
them slewed violently and began to run
in circles-just like a gallied whale
thought foyle a second lost headway
and bloomed in a cloud of smoke and
white steam but three others came on
and behind them two more-and from
the shells a cruiser must be somewhere in
the offing here in the harbor hell was
let loose as foyle had foreseen

  the nazis seemed to catch it all at
once down by the head one sank slow-
ly her guns still spurting flame two
were drifting afire another rose in the
air and foyle saw her break in two-a
torpedo probably shells were quartering
the entire harbor now and in horror
foyle saw the troopships and anchored
freighters reeling exploding

then the ship under him heaved and
the deck blew into ripples an explo-
sion below told that a shell had gone into
her izzy was yelling frantically from the
boat the chief gripped the rail and
yelled at foyle

  what ye waiting for

  you damn your eyes go down the
falls  retorted the second mate

  mcclelland lost no time up forward
sounded a fearful clang then an explosion
that made the ship shudder before the
chief was safely landed in the boat foyle
was sliding down it was comforting to
feel the ship between him and the clang-
ing death

  blast it the limeys are sinking every-
thing afloat he exclaimed

  well lets get to town and be safe
said mcclelland who was in the bow

  town not much barked foyle
izzy cast off them stern falls we got
to land here on this side the bay no
nazis here keep the harbor between us
and them

  for the moment lying under the
freighters counter they could see nothing

o time noxv to think he made his
weapon do the chattering

of what was happening but they could
hear plenty foyle whipped out his knife
and cut the lashing of the oars that were
beneath the thwarts and passed one for-
ward to the chief with an order to shove
off the falls were already cast off an-
other shell hit the ship above them went
clear through her without exploding and
blew the rusty iron plates into flinders
just over their heads izzy trying to ship
the rudder yelped and shook the boat-
stretcher in air

  gimme a chance at them nazis
he cried out just gimme one chance

  foyle was busy freeing the oars in the
bow chief mcclelland was standing and
pushing off from the ship and at this in-
stant something swung around under the
ships stern-a trim nazi launch that
must have come from one of the troop-
ships there were only half a dozen men
aboard her one of them an officer

  foyle did not see her izzy did and
yelped anew mcclelland gave her one
look and paid no heed shoving out the
boat but the officer in the launch just
as foyle became aware of her and looked
up shouted something inarticulate in a
hysterical voice threw up a pistol and
fired point blank he had no doubt lost
his head completely

  one wild cry burst from mcclelland
he dropped his oar spun around and
pitched down across the thwarts

  the nazi officer fired again the two
craft were almost alongside foyle saw
his face convulsed in panic emotion and
heard the bullet sing past an ear he saw
one of the other nazis raise a rifle to aim
and then mr foyle was conscious of
nothing more except the fury of rage that
consumed him and the webley pistol in
his own hand jerking as he fired
the blue book magazine

  next thing he saw was izzy over in the
launch and foyle stared slack-jawed
izzy had taken the boat-stretcher with
him four nazis were on their feet and
izzy went into them with his club
screaming like a maniac the officer who
had been winged by foyles first bullet
staggered to his feet pistol still in hand -
foyle fired once more and this time fin-
ished his work

  it was izzys fight however and he
went into it with a will and despite a bul-
let that raked across his cheek and left it
a red smear he concluded it without help
that club took the last nazi seaman un-
der the jaw and knocked him overboard
and he did not come up-those who went
into that bitter icy water seldom did

foyle dropped his pistol and went to
the prostrate mcclelland a rich
and peculiar odor struck foyles nos-
trils a groan escaped the chief and he
stirred and spoke as foyle turned him
over

  theres blood all down my legs i can
feel it for gods sake clap a bandage
on the wound hit me in the right side
it did my ribs are broke

  foyle explored caught his breath and
then drew back

  you blasted son of a sea-cook you
sanctimonious old scotch fraud  he cried
out in so keen a revulsion of relief that
he wanted to laugh and cry at once get
up and get to work  had a bottle of your
damned french cognac in your coat pock-
et eh well lick your own wounds and
youll taste the kind of blood that suits
you best come on-allez oop  

  he caught the hand of the dazed chief
and jerked him upright theh turned

  a thousand anvils exploded  the ships
plates close by bulged and clanged a
shell had gone off inside her she was al-
ready listing to port foyle saw the
launch was alongside now izzys voice
ringing at them

  hurry up youse guys i got the en-
gihe on neutral 

  mcclelland stumbled aboard and
foyle was after him with a hasty look at
the sprawled figiires the officer and two
men were dead another was wounded
there were no more izzys stretcher had
sent them over the rail bidding mcclel-
land look after the wounded man foyle
jumped to the tiller izzy was monkeying
with the engine controls

  all right izzy let her go 

  the launch moved swept into speed-
and a good thing she was not fifty feet

from the ship when a shell must have
reached the superstructure for it went
into the air

  lucky we had no steam up said the
chief morosely abandoning his patient
losh  would ye look at the sight 
the two troopships were gone from
the iron quay across the bay at narvik
and from the adjacent shore two bat-
teries were pumping three-inch shells at
the destroyers who were holding off out-
side the harbor proper foyle had al-
ready learned that the invading nazi
forces had no artillery larger than this

  but those destroyers had done their
work the last nazi destroyer was sink-
ing her stern high in air foyle saw that
his own ship like every other freighter in
harbor whether german or british or
neutral rad been deliberately cleaned
out one was afire the others were set-
tling or had already plunged

  the launch headed in for the nearer
shore izzy shut off the engine foyle
held her toward a dock coming out from
a fish-wharf there were no fishing-boats
here and as he scanned the shore he saw
everything deserted no one was here
under cover of the blizzard the inhabi-
tants had all cleared out nor had the
nazis come here	

  so out of the harbor that was adrift
with wreckage and spotted with bodies of
men and all slick with oil they crept into
the shore and made fast the wounded
seaman died as they tried to lift him the
bodies were put on the snowy dock

  whew said mr mcclelland and
now what 

  explore said foyle this craft
must have grub aboard and were going to
need it look below izzy i want you
forard and chief see if you can turn
up any binoculars i lost mine in the
shuffle

  the chief vanished foyle went for-
ward with izzy at his heels the launch
was a spick and span steamer evidently
from some naval craft but what had
drawn foyles attention was the machine-
gun mounted forward

ont ever tell me a yid cant
fight  he observed as he eyed the
cook and me thinking you were scared
stiff all the time  

  izzy grinned sheepishly so i was
mr foyle but some of my folks got it
in the neck in some of them concentra
tion-camps in germany and ive always
hoped maybe id get a chance to pay up
a bit
free and equal

  you paid all right i suppose you
dont know anything about machine-
guns

  yes sir  came the eager reply i
was in the national guard back home
before i went to sea ive shot em
manys the time

  foyle grunted the gun was well
cared for ammunition was at hand and
izzy turned up a lot more in the lockers
there were rifles aboard too examining
them foyle found them excellent rapid-
fire rifles of sub-machine-gun type

  why all this asked mr mcclel-
land when he emerged from below his
arms full foyle rubbed his stubbly chin
and looked out across the harbor where
everything had fallen quiet

  damned if i know chief but i fig-
ured things out and- hey whats that 
grub

  grub said the chief and some-
thing to drink too

the batteries had fallen silent the
destroyers had temporarily with-
drawn only drifting wreckage a waft
of smoke from the burning half-sunk
freighter and the occasional reports of
norwegian guns from far back of nar-
vik spoiled the quiet of the scene the
u-boat floating awash had not moved
as though all her crew were dead

  what was it you had figured mr
foyle the chief inquired

  oh that foyle squinted across the
water got his bearings and nodded
about these britishers now why
dyou suppose they sunk all these per-
fectly good ships because theyre cut-
ting off the nazis of course but are tak-
ing no chances most likely theyve got
no men to spare and want to make a
clean job of bottling up these lovely
aryan invaders that means theyll be
coming back presently

  most like agreed the chief while
izzy looked wide-eyed from one to the
other

  what are they going to do pursued
foyle shell the town bust up the elec-
tric railroad the quays and the expensive
equipment over there i doubt it on
the other side of town the snow has
blocked everything and the norwegian
guns are working these nazis have no
place to go but back and now their
ships are gone they cant go back
theyre stuck no heavy artillery no
ships no supplies what would you do
if you were the limey in command of
those destroyers 

  if i was a britisher said mcclel-
land scowling id do most anything to
be something else

  be sensible retorted foyle those
british are going to head for this spot
right here opposite narvik tonight
theyll slip in and land men and guns
thats why they destroyed all the ships
the nazis wont have any searchlights to
use in the harbor savvy but why do
you think this launch was nosing over to
this shore those nazis missed a bet
by not having some men and guns here
and theyre waked up to the fact theyll
be coming along pretty soon to get estab-
lished

  and whatll we do said the chief
work youre a mechanic that gun
is bolted onto a steel plate get it out
and put it on the dock here-steel plate
and all then chief youll take a bot-
tle of aquavit in one hand and the tiller
of this fast launch in the other and go
contact the british destroyers izzy and
i stay here    never mind talking
now get to work

  an hour passed the shelling had
ceased all was quiet no doubt the brit-
ish took for granted that the u-boat had
gone down to the bombs she lay under
the headland at an angle that left her
invisible to the outer fiord presently
foyle with the glasses saw two men
emerge from the conning-tower working
at something she rose in the water
though still at an angle foyle called
the chief and pointed

  if she wakes up you can make it
aye said mcclelland blinking at
the submarine shes well off to our
right i head left for the harbor en-
trance shell not fire on one of her own
launches and she cant catch me for
the launch is fast and she is not a good
risk aye 

by this time the half-sunk freighter
had burned out the gun and its
mounting was set up on the dock which
meant that snow had to be cleared from
the timbers and the snow was three feet
deep

  foyle with a pair of nazi binoculars
kept an eye on the town and quay oppo-
site and discerned a bustle of activity
there now however the chief was all
ready to go a seaman on the submarine
was wigwagging to narvik

  tell the britishers to come along and
waste no time about it said foyle
izzy and i will hold the fort whats
the good word izzy
  free and equal said the brooklyn
lad you said so yourself once we got
off the ship all men are born free and
equal

  the chief got into the launch and
turned

  i forgot to tell you he said point-
ing somewhat unsteadily to the stores
that had been piled up in the snow of the
wharf along with the rifles that the
bottom box in the first pile is a case o
champagne save it till we celebrate so
long and heaven protect you

  his movements were erratic and un-
certain but he knew what to do the
launch churned the water and darted
out and mr mcclelland sat down heav-
ily before he had pulled himself to-
gether the launch was a third of the way

across the harbor then it spun about
and headed for the open fiord the man
on the u-boat apparently paid no atten-
tion

  foyle watched with a groan i meant
to tell him to hug the shore blast it
-izzy come along and make sure the
gun is loaded and those magazine rifles
or whatever they ate as tfell jump ye
scullion 

  izzy rolled the last drops from the
aquavit bottle over his tongue

  i was thinking of that champagne
he said reflectively i drank cham-
pagne once when we were at havre
and mind you were all free and equal
now im just as good as you are and
i know how to use that gun and you
dont so keep civil
  foyle was so dumfounded that he
just stood there staring-and then his
eye caught sight of something moving
on the water

  look at your nazi friends coming
izzy 

  the launch had vanished from sight
mr mcclelland had evidently had no
trouble in reaching the fiord but two
boats had come around by the head of
the bay and were now lying alongside
the submarine the concussion of those
bombs must have left most of her crew
dead but she herself seemed little dam-
aged

  other small-craft however were now
streaking across the water ships boats
another and larger launch several fish-

  soldiers cried izzy and look at
the sub-shes moving pointed this
way 

  so she was and towing the two boats
though moving very slowly men in na-
val uniform were busy around the gun
on her forward deck and had installed
another evidently meant for aircraft aft
foyle focused the binoculars and cursed
heartily

  i expect she cant submerge so shes
heading this way some of her crew
must ha been ashore and now theyve
got her working she can shell us out
of here in no time

  not if she comes real close before
she knows were here  exclaimed izzy
excitedly you take them rifles and go
down to the next dock and lav for her

put tlmt sun on the dock itere-steel plate and all
the blue book magazine

i can work this here gun by myself if i
got to do it you keep her from shelling
us see ill stave off them boats may-
be we can hold em off till the british
get here 

  maybe foyle rubbed his head and
cursed again but suddenly he saw the
whole thing plainly and clutched izzy
by the shoulder

  right look here-see their game
put men here and guns and get the sub-
marine fixed up a bit then when the
british show up theyre caught between
two fires and cant land any men heres
your chance to really hurt them square-
heads izzy its a go gimme them
rifles i can work em and the extry
catridges    thats right dont be
in any hurry to shoot either so long

  he plunged away through the snow

in five minutes he was ensconced snug-
ly on the next wharf with rifles ex-
tra ammunition and a bottle of aquavit
he took a pull at this last and eyed the
water ahead that the launch boats and
submarine were all making for this group
of wharves was now evident the sub-
marine would get here first the launch
was towing a number of boats strung
out behind her and she like the first
launch had a gun mounted forward the
immediate threat however came from
the u-boats more dangerous armament

  provided that is she gets to use it
reflected foyle

  from the conning-tower an officer was
steering and two men were mounting an
antiaircraft gun there foyle had only a
vague acquaintance with these sub-
machine-guns  even their sights were
past his comprehension and he could not
afford guesswork better play safe he
told himself that u-boat was a good
five hundred yards off and coming in at
an angle wait for a hundred yards
even that would be risking a good deal
since he could not depend on his own aim
at first

  all right  called izzy hidden behind
the snow that framed his machine-gun

  guess so and lay off that liquor

  to hell with you  came the response
were free and equal you slave-driv-
er  

  what about you and them nazis
queried foyle wickedly

  they got machine-guns too aint
they that makes us equal but im
free

  you wont be once i get my hands
on you shut up and watch sharp

  foyle tipped the bottle again frankly
he was scared stiff a trifle over two
hundred yards he figured and cursed
the unfamiliar rifle-sights there could
be only one end to this business what
a blasted fool he had been not to clear
out with the launch 

  smart guy he muttered squinting
down the rifle-barrel show-off guy
you are  the kid and his free-and-equal
stuff-why didnt ou forget you were
an american and slide out of here- and
him a jew fightin like hell-you just
had to go him one better you blasted
fool hello-

  the submarine drifted into his sights
he blinked and drew a bead on the offi-
cer standing at the wheel in the high
conning-tower he squeezed and cursed
to the recoil the officer fell a lucky
shot

  no time now to think he made his
weapon do the chattering not too fast
either a couple of misses-he was over-
shooting the men at the after-deck
gun two of them caught his burst and
went floundering he swept forward
again two figures in the conning-tower
jammed and crowded there with the dead
officer became quiet on forward-ajj
the men were at that quick-firing gun
were slipping in a clip of shells foyles
bullets raked the group mercilessly de-
liberately

  at that range it was good shooting
by sheer luck he had adjusted the sights
more or less accurately and the weapon
was a beautiful piece of mechanism he
peered forward eagerly the submarine
with no living thing on her deck was
forging ahead straight in for the shal-
laws and the wharves a man came leap-
ing erect on the conning-tower and
yelled sharply foyle fired again and
again the boat of the dead came on

suddenly he ducked at the scream
past his head-another  he remem-
bered those boats and peered forth the
launch in the lead had her gun going
snow spurted all about him panic
gripped at his heart there was a long
slow rending crash-the u-boat had run
her narrow nose up alongside a wharf
fifty feet away

  then izzy cut loose and the blaring
stutter was sweet to hear that launch
filled with men took the blast of lead on
its port bow those about the machine-
gun were mowed down the men with
rifles in this and the other craft were all
blazing away now but the havoc
free and equal

wrought among them was frightful as
izzys bullets swept back and forth along
the line-the launch was ridden down
by the boats in tow and everything be-
came a jumbled mass of drifting death
and chaos

  the boats were stopped then the in-
fernal stutter ceased foyle heard the
voice of izzy uplifted in a frightful wail

  shes jammed hard jammed keep
shooting-for christs sake keep shoot-
ing  

  a burst of laughter welled up in foyle
-furious ironic laughter at such a word
coming from izzy he fumbled for his
rifle it slipped away and was gone in
the snow and water he caught up the
other one and tried to handle it some-
thing wrong however he got it work-
ing spraying bullets out at the boats for
a moment until pain jerked at him he
knew he must have been hit somewhere
his head drooped

vaguely he had a mental picture of
izzys lanky figure leaping and run-
ning toward the stranded sub his senses
leaped alert he found the aquavit bottle
put it to his lips and swallowed every-
thing cleared

  izzy was leaping aboard the u-boat
mfen were there shooting-they must
have come up from below desperately
foyle turned his weapon on them and
groaned as the recoil shocked pain
through his body the figures wilted
izzy was still going darting to the quick-
firer on the upended forward deck swing-
ing it around

  the gun exploded  the shell exploded 
another followed it slap among the boats
where men were firing rifles another
shell the boats broke opened out
took to flight two of them were sink-
ing heads were dotting the water a
roaring laugh shook foyle and with en-
tire forgetfulness of himself he came to
his feet

  good work izzy he yelled good
work 

  he pitched over into the snow   

  when he came to himself everything
was different there was no more snow
he was sitting propped up on a hard sur-
face he blinked around wincing at the
pain in his leg wondering to find it
stripped and bandaged he was sitting
on the submarines deck propped against
the forward gun-standard his eyes fo-
cused on things around 

  hey said izzys voice woke up
good well have a drink in a minute

  izzy was there a dozen feet away sit-
ting against the base of the conning-
tower a long luger pistol in his hand
-izzy grinning at him but haggard and
white of face eyes blazing shirt and
jacket gone and a bloody bandage across
his chest and working at the corks of
bottles two men across the deck-two
men who stole frightened glances at
izzy as they worked two men-ger-
man seamen by their uniforms

  what the hell said foyle weakly
its all right exclaimed izzy these
guys showed up your legs broke and
ive got a bum chest but i guess well
pull through anyhow were going to
celebrate see those bottles are cham-
pagne this here submarine is ours and
were sitting pretty and by the smoke
over the headland the british fleets
coming suit you

  foyle gasped why you darned lit-
tle yid  free and equal says yon-and
that goes for me too yes sir i take
off my hat to you 

  he turned his head and looked at the
water the boats were gone smoke
sure enough curling up with the wind
a sharp report made him jump but it
was only one of the corks going out the
other followed

  the two nazis with sheepish grins
approached with the bottles they eyed
izzy furtively whatever had happened
thought foyle that lad must have put
the fear of the lord into those two sur-
vivors they handed over the bottles
and then stepped back

  izzy lifted his bottle in his left hand
keeping the pistol in the other

ell mr foyle said he we
celebrate in champagne  you give
the toast

  not me said foyle its your war
izzy-your u-boat your prisoners the
honors are yours name the toast your
own self

  okay replied izzy cheerfully he
waved his fizzing bottle at the two pris-
oners boys whether you understand
or not dont matter but theres one thing
you aint got and you need mighty bad
and about the only person you can get it
from is a jew

hurry up said foyle im thirsty
okay  and izzy waved the bot-
tle again heres luck to you nazis no
hard feelins and when you need it most
 let there be light 

  amen to that-and heres the british
coming cried foyle and drank deep

the story thus far

hats yo business stran-
geh  demanded the older of
two men in a fine pirogue
who held wing dobussy tip
at the point of their rifles

  wild-crafting dobussy answered
trapping fishing frogs-

  jes loafing thas all-jes a vaga-
bond  we don low no tramps er sech
trash down yeah no suh i rest yo
charge of no visible means of support
pick im up duck 

  and an hour later dobussy found him-
self a shackled slave among a score of
others beaten with a mule-whip if he
slackened in his labor at an illicit distil-
lery concealed in the vast swamp-the
property of old dolomen hatchie who
with his overseer duck wamber had
kidnaped the luckless wild-crafter

 dobussy bided his time and one
stormy evening weeks later he heard a
sudden rifle-shot and the armed guard
pitched into the water at once dobussy
plunged into the undergrowth there was
no pursuit and he finally came to his
moored cabin-boat and no one saw the
canoe of isbelle strake-a swamp angel
girl who had been friendly with dobussy
-as it sped away

  dobussy went back to that peonage
moonshine still he shot up the guards
then he freed the other slaves set fire
to the still-and went back to his boat

  the feud went on dobussy shot and
killed old dolomen hatchie but later
hatchies son and duck wamber got the
drop on dobussy and wetzel hatchie
deliberately shot him three times in the
stomach-leaving him to die hatchie
supposed a lingering and agonized death
dobussys thick money-belt saved him
however and he recovered meanwhile
young hatchie needing money marketed
some of his fathers hidden illicit liquor
and was caught by the federal authorities
the story continues in detail

wetzel hatchie was ready to fight
his arrest for liquor-running and
-selling clear up to the united states su-
preme court he called in attorney
ranger to see him ihrough the mazes of
the federal court bail was supplied
by a professional

  in rangers office wetzel announced
his indignation his determination and his
war intentions ranger let him run down
like a phonograph and with a depreca-
tory wave of his hands dismissed all such
foolish and blustering talk

  now listen wetzel ranger said
this is mendova so its your turn to
learn your lessons you hatchies have
been accustomed to your own way but
where you made your mistake wetzel--
pap dolomen neveh transported he run
his merchandise out to the bank of ol
mississip theh he took his cash and

inflt oobussy retorted

pleased no amateur can run liquor on
big muddy gut  now you transported
you just delivered-an you got caught
now yoll pay to boot dont mistake
that hatchie ill take yo plumb to
washington but i advise you to plead
guilty to smile and top off by apologiz-
ing for the small quantity you had aboard
and the amount of trouble you made in
proportion to how much good stuff you
had

  sweat gathered on hatchies brow i
reckon i better not fight-this time he
said

  next time dont get caught ranger
said-and the back-swamp man saw
the amusement in his attorneys eyes

  ranger shoved the case through in a
hurry the u s commissioner assessed
a nominal fine of five hundred dollars each
on hatchie and wamber the liquor being
confiscated hatchie avent to one of his
banks the swamp bottom and gave a
three-months note raising money for
rangers five-hundred-dollar fee and the
two fines he went up the mississippi
with duck on the steam packet his
launch and the barge hed bought from

isbelle strake became valued equipment
in the service of the prohibition division
of course the government seized such
equipment

  the boat landed on monday afternoon
about one oclock wetzel hatchie and
duck wamber headed right up through
town on their way to the old stalcum
mansion both of them were just prac-
tically ready to explode with indignation

  then two mutts began to yap at their
heels and they discovered the attention
they were getting-people holding their
hands over their mouths hiding smiles
wetzel drew his two -caliber revolvers
and started to shoot the mutts and they
turned running yelping with their tails
between their legs wetzel slam-banged
away    twelve shots-and one bullet
glanced and killed a mule but the dogs
got away the mule was worth two hun-
dred dollars and belonged to judge
brooners brother-in-law

  hatchie and wamber headed for the
house but wetzel told duck to see about
the mule it had to be settled for anoth-
er two hundred bucks early on the
following morning hatchie and wamber

headed back into the brakes up the al-
bion they were hot and heavy now
looking for whoever had raided their
cache wamber did the heaviest think-
ing he had ever done in his life

  back in the old distillery days wam-
ber recollected trouble with a runner
named simon purekelton kelton got
in wambers way at the whisky-landing
and got upset tripping over the tramway
they had a fist-fight and kelton hit wam-
ber in the stomach wamber pulled his
gun and kelton threw a bung-starter and

wamber was knocked senseless then
grandpap hatchie took a hand stuck
kelton up with his gun and worked him
in the distillery for a month same as any-
one else kelton had declared he would
get even with duck and grandpap for
that but this was the first sign duck ever
had of his bragging being made good

  i bet hit was kelton duck declared
lately hes been self-pretending he
quieted down honorable i reckon hes
snuck in onto us the way things look i
betcha he raided that liquor

git goin offii these bottoms-dont eveh come back this is gun-muzzle notice
  keltons just the kind of a scoundrel
to perform a trick like that  hatchie
approved hes just a gambler loafer
runner-around

  back in the swamps they headed over
into old river where kelton had a
shanty-boat they took it through bay-
ous wamber knew and luck was with
them

  kelton had been down to scattering
court the day before and they saw him
coming with a big outboard skiff just
loaded down with supplies they head-
ed him wetzel pulling one of his revolv-
ers kelton grabbed up his shotgun but
wamber was ready for business with his
- he made a sure pretty shot get-
ting kelton through and through

 hatchie and wamber both looked
around for it was risky even in the deep
swamps to shoot a man down kind of
careless like that and sure enough over
in the marsh in the next channel they saw
the wake and swells of a fast light boat
they caught two or three glimpses of the
traveler whoever he was

  why-why-why that looks like-
hatchie half spoke half whispered to
himself but it caint be 

  he turned and glared at wamber who
was blinking and swallowing

   tol yo mist hatchie wamber
shook his head violently i know yo
dont blieve in no ghostes-but-but
thats wing dobussy i seen im plain
suh

  ghosts-wing dobussy what non-
sense you damned fool  snarled hat-
chie glaring waiting for contradiction
but wamber just licked his lips and
watched those boat-waves rocking in the
sunshine

  keltons skiff had run aground they
hauled off the boat retreated into the
narrow jungle ways and looked over
their reward for vengeance supplies
worth a hundred or so dollars around
keltons waist was a horsehide pocket
belt full of paper currency hatchie
counted out  and probably fifty
diamonds to boot worth as much more

ow thats luck   hatchie declared
with satisfaction thatll just
take care of things nicely 

  wamber hesitated he had killed kel-
ton all that loot he figured by good
rights belonged to him even partnering
he was entitled to half hatchie had an
unmitigated gall to hog it all

  thisll clear things up right  hat-
chie went on itll make up the five-hun-

dred-dollar fine i paid for you wamber
and pay for the lawyer and all the rest
you got me into running that damned
liquor and well have a little spare
change to work on to boot

  yas suh  duck nodded glumly
whatll we do with this hatchie di-
verted attention to the body of kelton
you better show your swampcraft now
duck killins is serious

to conceal the body in that swamp
was not difficult however and after-
ward when night had fallen they drove
down the winding river back to scatter-
ing court and up the mansion bayou
where wamber stocked the hatchie pan-
try larder with the supplies that kelton
had bought

  in the morning hatchie covered his
embarrassing overdraft in the bank he
casually paid several annoying little
bills he gave lotus stalcum two hun-
dred dollars he owed her his bearing
that of a man conferring a great favor
on a working-girl

  next day hatchie went to the floating
fish-dock at the scattering court landing
on the mississippi nobody knew more
about affairs up the albion bottoms
than the fishermen and other wildcraft-
ers as he came to the top of the bank
hatchie saw a barge load of mussel-
shells forty tons or so of them bur-
dock watkins had stopped in to talk
with the fish-dock boys and eat a snack
uptown in the lunch-room

  im paying one hundred fifty dollars
a ton for those selects  hatchie heard
watkins say they make fancy pistol-
butts knife-handles and sech like i
have two tons thehn the bow compart-
ment thehs thirty-eight tons of reg-
lar stock yas suh thehs eighteen
hundred dollars sunk in that load 
watkins had been drinking shine or
he wduld never have bragged his busi-
ness thataway

  wetzel hatchie sauntered up the levee
hissing a tune through his long narrow
teeth squinting thoughtfully he wrote
a column of figures on a scratch pad

shells        
rat skins        
turtles         
frogs               
                      
fur  days         
                 
frogs not figured
the blue book magazine

  why damn it  hatchie exploded
under his breath thats real money
why those damned scoundrels are tak-
ing my fish my furs my button-shells
my feathers my turtles frog and game-
meat right off my land and im not get-
ting a damned smitch of it

the people living on backbone ridge
plantations were served by a ferry
where the albion cut through the ridge
at a place called the narrows the ferry
franchise belonged to the old pagen
plantation most of whih was now cov-
ered by quit-claims and tax-sale re-
ceipts

  right thehs the place for me to es-
tablish a dock and a trading-post 
hatchie decided when he went up the
albion looking at the things he had nev-
er seen or dreamed before every boat
up or down carries business-and they
have to go through the narrows why
this place was made for a toll-gate for
collections huh

  having looked over the situation
studied the related papers and seen that
a quick smash would probably do the
business he discovered just about the
prettiest piece of opportunity he had
come across yet lon pagen hadnt re-
newed his state ferry license ten dol-
lars when the license was delinquent
anyone could take it up nobody ever
had probably nobody ever thought of it

  hatchie went up to pagens ferry
tacked up the new license and informed
lon that he was very sorry but the old
license and franchise had a new owner
lon had about one hundred acres of
land left where he put in an acre of
garden and what with the two hundred
qollars or so from the ferry and a little
killing of pork lard beef he eked along

  ill give you five hundred dollars
cash money for your quit-claim backed
by your wifes signature for whats left
hatchie said

  the money in currency was more cash
than lon had seen in one bunch before
hed never kept any books he couldnt
tell even how much came from the ferry
business hed been thinking about sell-
ing out anyhow he had a nice shanty-
boat big enough to live on and he had
a spare launch heavy-duty to tow it
he reckoned he could make more fishing
shelling and trapping than running that
plaguey old place he reserved the fur-
niture and personal property and signed
with his wife giving up the patch of
land and whatever rights that remained

  he was down at the fish-dock in the
mississippi when he happened to re-
member he must have two-three hundred
hogs and a hundred head of beef running
around in the brake he went uptown
to bargain the stock out to weriman a
cattle-drover who knew about what he
had weriman agreed to pay twelve hun-
dred dollars for the pork and beef if the
title was all clear weriman telephoned
to wetzel hatchie

  oh i bought the stock with the
place hatchie said

  some nice points of law were involved
as to whether the verbiage and the speci-
fications actually transferred the cows
and hogs with the land timber etc
but lon pagen had his five hundred
dollars cash it would take about all
the money if he went to lawing even
against any one on equal terms

  i wouldnt have a show in gods
world against that wetzel hatchie
pagen decided and cast off his lines
floating down the old mississip his
wife crying noiselessly and he feeling
pretty mean himself

  hatchie knew what he was about now
-a good deal of it anyhow he printed
a notice in the scatterings commercial
stating that the hatchie estate all fts
lands in the dark corner area had been
duly established as a private reserve
that notices to this effect had been and
were being posted every hundred yards
around the outside boundaries of the pre-
serve and along all the private roads
private waterways ditches and around
the lakes ponds marshes old rivers and
as specified

  those interested will find in the
county clerks office maps and descrip-
tions according to titles herein claimed
and owned by the hatchie estate the
notices read wetzel hatchie signed as
manager and executor

every autumn for at least twenty
years the mendova turkey club
had tripped up the albion pitched their
tents moored their boats spread out
with their weapons and banged away at
their favorite game table-meat enjoying
themselves immensely this autumn
they headed up the albion out of the
mississippi towing a shanty-boat for
headquarters to do away with tent-both-
ers when they plowed up into the nar-
rows they saw bright new cabins built
on top of the bank and read an extraor-
dinary and surprising sign nailed on two
posts in the ground for all to read
swamp angel

private preserve

         all trespass forbidden
         under legal penalties

  the cabin-cruiser which served as a
towboat slacked its speed while the ten
sportsmen glared at that peculiar and
inexplicable warning a tall gangling
cabbage-headed man appeared a -
rifle in the crook of his elbow he was
grinning across his crinkled countenance

vh hell attorney ranger ex-
vy claimed ithats duck wamber-
i know him speed up old man-lets
go they cant do that 

  the motor took hold and the propel-
ler boiled again under the stern of the
cabin-cruiser the little houseboat the
string of small boats straightened out
and gathered headway in the pale green
waters as they started on up the long
stillwater

  hey-y where do yo fellers think
yere goin duck yelled like a hog-
caller yo caint go by heah

  the hell we caint ranger shouted
back you know me 

  sure i know yo duck shouted
grinning i paid yo for cort-business
nbw yo pay me for huntin-business 
gwan ranger turned to the motor
engineer he cant do a damned
thing

  the little fleet started up the eddy a
shot cracked and a bullet splashed off to
the left of the tow the club burgee a
yellow silk flag showing a turkey gobbler
rampant flopped over as the jackstaff
broke down cut in two by ducks soft-
nose bullet

  next time ill git yo carburetor
mist hatchie means business you fel-
lers duck shouted keep yo hands
offn yo guns theh 

  damn it  ranger spoke under his
breath wed better see hatchie this
scoundrels ignorant swing around
george 

  this knocks us out of a hunting
dav  dr scurtis spoke up

  wambers got notches on hjs car-
bine   ranger said hes bad  

  on the way down to see hatchie the
club met the fish-company tug plowing
up for a regular thursday collection
capn trask learned that mr hatchie
was handling the dark corner fish him-
self that was his private country and
he didnt want private competition bur-
dock watkins returned with his forty-

ton shell barge to pick up the button
stock he had bought only three days be-
fore

  i dont know nothin about that
wamber told watkins my orders is
to keep trespassers offn these lands and
waters

  this is a public highway  watkins
shouted angrily

  not while i got my - unlim-
bered taint public  duck assured him
grinning hopefully when i stop talk-
in this carbine speaks 

  watkins returned to scattering court
where attorney windgate said he didnt
believe navigable waters could be closed
but it would be better to reach an ami-
cable understanding with mr wetzel
hatchie an honorable friendly gentle-
man yo dont want trouble of
course windgate said

  hatchie was affable watkins told of
buying thirty-five tons of button shells
on the east fork of the albion and be-
lieved he had a right to his own prop-
erty hatchie shook his head he was
sorry he was acting on principle be-
ing obliged to obey his own rules he
figured mr watkins ought to have found
out who owned the shells before buying
however this time mr hatchie would
relinquish his claims asking merely a
nominal ten dollars a ton on the shells
- on the tonnage

a score of boats had gone down the
albion to buy supplies in scatter-
ing court on their return they found
themselves stopped at the old ferry nar-
rows the barston boys had sold their
first autumnal take of fur they turned
back and went up the mississippi around
to their homestead river landing prat
adkin the willow-basketmaker had sold
twelve dollars worth of baskets and
started home with store eatings for a
feast duck stopped him and there he
was outside and his wife with four chil-
dren were inside wamber slammed a
bullet right through adkins skiff

  the sports the shell- and fish-buyers
and seven swamp angel outfits were
stopped when night fell a score of
boats were moored to the banks below
the narrows rumors had reached them
that the dark corner wasnt public any
longer that the waterways were all to
be closed up no one believed it pos-
sible but there stood duck wamber
chuckling at their predicament-unable
even to go get their tents and outfits
their shanty-boats and other things
  all alone dock stood gurd flourish-
ing his carbine the sun shone on him
as he strutted back and forth at the top
of the bank proud and haughty in his
new job of superintendent of the hatchie
estate wild-lands grimacing and his red
hair bristling all ready for business

  at the foot of the bank which was
steep and about fifteen feet high was a
landing-float a platform laid on twelve
iron barrels in a raft-frame he had
two big powerful lights one with a yel-
low glass a fog-penetrator so he could
watch the river night or day in a fog or
if it was clear

  the sun lowered toward setting the
sky all clear and the light turning yel-
low duck wamber stood with the
shine on him shoulders back stomach
out head up jaws set carbine ready for
business the sun glaring in his eyes

  suddenly there was a thudding shot
across the river on the west side some
claimed they saw a fuzz of smoke in the
green cane brake a smack followed
all knew the sound of a bullet landing
a heavy lead slug hitting hard the back
of wamjjers coat jerked back and an-
other sntack followed quick as a wink

  the superintendent guard staggered
stumbling back three or four steps drop-
ping his carbine out of his elbow his
eyes bulging and mouth opening wide
his big feet cross-stepped as he swayed
and bent over his face wearing a look
of terrified astonishment he started to
reach stooping to pick up his rifle and
pitched down on his face right at the
edge of the bank he bumped up slid
over the brink and went rolling flop-
ping down the slickery clay and slid div-
ing headfirst into the water like an otter

everyone in sight watched him
no ohe said a word no one stirred
more than to wriggle some squinted
toward the thickety stand of green cane
but if they saw anything didnt show it
faces set in grim expressions gazing in-
to the elear green waters

  some could see duck wamber sprawl-
ing deep in the limpid depths kicking
and spreading like a big crawfish sil-
very bubbles lopping up to the surface
bursting there

  reckon them two big revolvers an
all them shells in his belt sunk him looks
like prat adkin called to the three
strakesy who were just below him hav-
ing beeri barred from their return to their
outfit well hit looks like the block-
ades lifted folks im gwine home

  all down the tvro banks the boats
that were moored-ifi cast off their lines

  the sun was down day was rapidly
fading as the long-delayed fleet plowed
upstream in a few minutes the ferry
eddy was quiet deserted in the gloom

sheriff harker investigates

word of the killing came to scat-
tering court in a kind of rumor
sheriff harker was eating lunch in
the court square restaurant when a
river tripper who had dropped down the
mississippi said that talk was down at
the landing that somebody had been
shot up the albion yesterday evening

  they say he was a sure-nuff bad ac-
tor the river man added feller name
of duck wamber who was performin
an cuttin up promiscuously interfering
an he jus naturally got popped oveh
course all i knows jes the talk echoin
around

  duck wamber  sheriff harker ex-
claimed full of surprise and alarm
shu-u well i betteh-

  without waiting for his pie or second
cup of coffee the sheriff headed over to
the brick office of the hatchie estate

  duck wamber killed up hatchie
yelped why that caint be the
scoundrel dont live thatd dare kill my
head man like that 

  inquiry around failed to discover
more than the rumor however-

  we betteh run in theh jus to satisfy
ouh curiosity sheriff harker said to
hatchie well take out the runabout
-kinda look the situation oveh wetzel
the two headed up the mississippi and
around into the albion they discov-
ered a fast launch heading past them
presently one belonging to a wild-crafter
neither harker nor hatchie knew
hatchie suggested they try to head him
but the boat drove on leaving the green
waters of the albion rocking and back-
washing from the banks when they
came in sight of the narrows the fast
launch went right on past the newly es-
tablished outpost without the steersman
even turning his head to look at it

  i dont understand that hatchie
exclaimed ducks orders were to stop
everybody-going and coming

  harker uttered an exclamation pull-
ing the runabout wheel hard over to keep
from hitting something sucked up from
the river bottom by the boat ahead and
looking overside the two men saw it was
a floater-duck wamber himself light
enough now to carry up the two guns
on his hips reversing harker backed
down wetzel hatchie slipped a white-
line noose over the dead man and they
towed the body to the landing-float
where every passer-by was supposed to
stop and show his credentials

  shot right plumb through the chest 
sheriff harker shook his head uneasily
and then the two glanced around with
searching eyes at the timber less than
a hundred yards distant across the green
waters of the sliding albion

  hatchie went up the gangplank to the
top of the bank and looked toward the
cottage and little commissary where
supplies were stored and papers could be
made out at the rear was another
small structure containing a barrel of
motor-oil gasoline and cans of grease
the door had been broken open and
apparently gasoline and other supplies
had been taken

  over at the edge of the bank ten yards
distant lay the - hatchie picked
it up that was wambers sure enough
it was cocked ready to shoot but the
barrel was clean and the magazine full
when the sheriff came he saw where
duck had pitched down the steep slick
clay bank leaving a few plain traces of
blood where he had slid into the water

hatchie stared at the body stretched on
the new yellow float-deck boards

  well sheriff harker  he demanded
in sudden impatience

  i dont like the look of that wetzel
harker said frankly this aint no com-
mon killin 

  bosh hatchie snarled hits jus
plain mean ornery murder this
means a hanging what you going to
do bout it i want to know

 well-i been noticin see that
fresh bark-scar back theh

  after killing wamber the bullet had
struck the bark of a shapely pecan tree
a hundred feet back from the bank
from a branch of the tree a long gam-
brel pole reached to a hickory pole fork
fifteen feet distant the pole was like
a gallows beam more than ten feet from
the ground razorbacks beef deer bear
and other game could be hung from it

  thats a sizable bullet harker re-
marked a - old-fashioned lead i
reckon by the stain sure gouged the
sapwood splinterin hit that shot came
from the green cane brake on yon side-
dead-level flight

  damnable cowardly bushwhacker
hatchie exclaimed you offer one
thousand dollars reward-ill make up
another thousand we can buy a riveh-
rat or swamp-angels soul for a hundred
dollars but some sportsman may know

i demand an explanation declared
hatchie tust where do yo stand
sheriff harker
the blue book magazine

something you have to pay reasonable
to get a sports testimony

 ill have to have the supervisors au-
thority harker said i wouldnt be too
hasty thehs legalities-

  i know you wouldnt hatchie said
you old-timers-slow easy and thrift-
less why with all due respect to the
dead those damned trespassers have
walked and floated right out under my
fathers eyes-mine too-with more than
a million dollars in products and they
didnt half work it makes me mad to
think of it perhaps a million in furs
alone 

  reckon wed betteh go back to the
courthouse an get a posse the sheriff
said two of us caint do much-
swear them in heah hatchie cried
there comes a boat-

  you reckon you want swamp angels
for a posse harker asked his voice
mild or-um-m-theyre shanty-boat-
ers riveh-rats drappin down

  try them the angry heir of the
dark corner ordered

  you betteh stay up the bank hark-
er suggested ill drap out an talk to
them 

  a fleet of shanty-boats small gasoline
cabin-boats and rag-shacks were coming
down in a string outboards and marine
motors running as the tow moved slowly
in the long albion river bend the of-
ficer recognized a slim tall stoop-shoul-
dered figure

  howdy cateen-movin out the
sheriff asked

  yas suh gittin purty fresh feath-
ehs is heavy razorback melt is thick
lowed we betteh git to go below the
mud hole or the old mouth or somers
gwine to be a hard winter

  listen cateen-dont you want to
be deputy sheriff-

  lawd gawd-no  the man cried
shrilly not fo a millyum dollars re-
warding  

  anybody here want to do posse
duty  the sheriff called

  no suh  no suh   voices answered
shrilly many from behind cover

  whats the matter-two dollars a
day and found  the sheriff asked

  no suh joe faldry a wildcrafter
shook his head hits chillin rheumat-
ic weather  sides my wifes sistehs sick-
enin liable to be took bad any time

five families went on by with more
than a dozen boats some of them had
been for years in the dark corner but

  they didnt want trouble with anyone
  the world is big they would settle
  somewhere else in free country down
  below the sheriff sheered off and
  shoved back to the l anding-float

    wetzel hatchie stood tall and thin
  darkly silhouetted against the milky
  sky at the top of the bank his rifle rest-
  ing in the crook of his elbow

    theyre getting out hatchie said as
  the sheriff came to him

    yas suh shiftless peaceable ones
  harker assented the feeble fearful
  harmless ones

    theyre all going out  hatchie de-
  clared sharply youll serve notices on
  the rest-take a real posse in youll
  run the hard mean despicable ones out
  afteh these low-downs

    i neveh yet needed a posse to serve
  a notice harker answered gently not
  often even to serve a warrant but this
  yeahs right serious wetzel hatchie
  harker shook his head id better work
  friendly and serve the papers right
  now thehs duck yore special under-
  sheriff mist hatchie-yo cn jes take
  him down in yo launch an knowin the
  legalities-what the coroner needs to go
  by an so on thatll get things goyi
  all accordin to the common law
  wetzel showed his yellowing teeth
  and the grimace was like an angry cats
  all right-come on  he ordered
  heave im aboard there 

  harker a large thick-waisted man
  with deceptively slow motions and
  imperturbable gravity smiling wrinkles
  and serene blue eyes-never more serene
  than in the face of deadly peril-
  watched hatchie steer the boat around
  in a circle to head downstream the
  sheriffs glances flickered along the lines
  of trees on both sides down the river

    trouble-meanness in the brakes
  now he shook his head and then he
  entered the county launch to head up
  the albion visiting to go to tents
  shanty-boats shacks and the abiding-
  places of those who hadnt made up their
  minds whether they were going to get
  off gods own country or not

    his badge large bright and golden
  was right square over his heart a sure
  good mark to shoot at against his gray-
  brown wind-proof shirt back in here
  somewhere was a man who had shot
  duck wamber down without warning
  from the brush and there was talk about
  old pap dolomens - rifle being hid
  out ready for more business perhaps
  
swamp angel

this killer would hate sheriff harker
even more on account of his official po-
sition well a sheriffd count on that

up at the y-fork on the east bank was
a camp built of logs brush tar-
paper-nets hung up highjack wag-
ers-no one in sight but he hailed
t howdy wager this is sherf hark-
er-i- aint legal today-jes lookin
round-

  howdy a voice answered from the
brake and a man with a gun and squir-
rels in his game-sack as if just in from
hunting appeared

j the sheriff landed and joined the fish-
erman inside the shack the fire in the
stove was burning coffee was set back
on the top and cups were poured imme-
diately when they had been drunk
sheriff harker began to talk

  the hatchie estates developing its
holdings he explained theyve got
titles filed all legal by the court clerk
wetzel hatchies going to license evey-
body cording to law sos they cn sell
their fish furs ducks an shells to him
theht the green cane line crossin hes
goin to hire out huntin trappin an

well sheriff i-yo see- the fish-
erman hesitated

  oh i see-theyve kinda hid out
count of havin furs in camp-some of
these riveh-pirates bein mighty unreli-
able i reckon well ifn yo happen
to see any of the boys im jes politi-
cianing the sheriff said i aint on
official business why i aint even post-
in reward-notices this trip the hatchie
estates offerin a thousand dollars re-
ward for whoever killed up duck wam-
ber but i aint even had the bills printed
yet-

  duck killed up wager asked
somebody said something bout that-
i didnt hear the right of hit

  we found him boating just blow
that new dock harker said hed

been plumbed right through the left
side in an out he aint autopsied yet
looked to me as though the bullet come
from the green cane a fine shot at 
yards i figure well ill be moving
the sheriff shook the swamp angels
hand and turning back around the point
went up the west fork of the albion

  the dark corner was lonesome quiet
treacherous wearing his badge that-
away in the bright sunlight was bold
especially as he was going single-handed
into those gloomy fastnesses when he
came into the first broad a lake with a
deep channel through it he heard a mo-
tor and met the waves coming down but
his shout brought no answer somebody
was in a hurry or something

  then he met prat adkin the willow-
basketmaker coming down on his way
to camp with a dugout canoe loaded with
great bundles of osiers sheriff harker
just waved his hand genially prat
wouldnt talk to god himself according
to the saying--not confidentials the
court had tried to make him testify
about a killing he witnessed down at the
county-seat river-landing thirty days
for contempt just made him happy-all
he wanted to eat and nothing to do

then the sheriff took the square turn
at the head of the broad toward the
east and suddenly a fast skiff came up
behind him

  howdy sheriff  a man greeted
him reckon yo know me-wing do-
bussy 

  why hello wing sho do been
wonderin where the dickens im gittin
to the official exclaimed as the boats
drew side by side together	

  yo aint lost heah sheriff dobussy
shook his head yore a swamp angel
yourself 

  oh i was jes talkin the sheriff ad-
mitted i reckon ive chased scouters
killers scoundrels or witnesses through
jes about evy slough creek wide-water
an mud-puddle from the haid of the al-
bion clear downt the state line far as
that goes but yo know couple days
ago somebody jes drapped duck wam-
ber daids a hammer downt the hatchie
holdings land line wetzel done built
him a toll-gate theh an had duck in
to clect licenses but somebody done
clected him instead

an yore afteh the killer sheriff
no suh not to know im i aint oh
course if i run across im for sure an
certain id tote im in i expaict the
officer admitted but when i head in
afteh him personal i gotta have a posse
of mighty good shots an plenty of
nerve he drapped duck plumb center
at a good  yards take moren one
officer to blockade that feller what
im doin now is explainin the legalities
of this yeah private-preserve injunction
the proposition is i aint got no papers
to serve nothin like that i jes want
evybody to know the way things is
thats fine sheriff  dobussy ex-
claimed ive heard bout this hogging
of the game fur shells fish i read the
private-preserve notices on the trees an
what they said in the newspaper i won-
dered about it id like to hear the right
of hit of course hits gittin kinda late
sheriff yo betteh just spend the night
with me hadnt you or are yo goin
somers in particular 

  im jes moseyin around nowhere in
particular sheriff harker answered i
jes aim to hang up my hat mos anywhere
they cn stand my compny

  accordingly dobussy led the way and
the officer followed him through the in-
tricate waters to the beautiful pine- and
white-oak-framed cabin-boat hidden in
the little harbor on deep water as near-
ly impossible to find unguided as an
alligators nest

wing lighted a gasoline mantle
lamp and started to get supper
while sheriff harker sat smoking a pipe
taken from a large wooden bowl with
loose tobacco on the table wing worked
easily with both hands making wild-
goose croquettes frying scrapple of
white-corn and razorback baking hot-
bread and setting the table with a vari-
ety of fruit molasses wild honey and
other specials

  neither one pretended the sheriffs
visit wasnt serious there was murder
in the dark corner trouble was feared
even this shanty-boat being located
away back in the heart of the brakes
was according to the notices posted by
the hatchie estate illegal frankly
sheriff harker told his host what to ex-
pect

  course the next move is to swear
out dispossesses and send me in heah
with posses to move yo boys out
harker said frankly thats law strat-
egy and-

  passing the buck for you to handle
when hits hot dobussy said

  reckon yo know the right of it
harker assented morosely

  supper was sure tasty and plenty the
two of them cleaned the dishes together
and then sat down in the living cabin
before the sheet-iron wood-baker cur-
tains covered every window  not a streak
of light would shine through to betray
the boat to a passer-by in that water
pocket surrounded by dense willows
and island brake

  course wing i want you to under-
stand this harker said after a long
silence im sheriff elected by most of
the voters to perform the duties of my
office but i dont reckon anything
youve told me is part of my official in-
formation i respect yo confidences
the day i come into this country with
warrants an dispossesses ive got to
learn all these brakes an bayous oveh
agin ill hire a guide an i wont know
moren he knows moren my posse
thinks with a posse im fair game fo
outlaws when im alone id hate to
be shot down-for then im jes ornery
human

  dobussy gazed at him his face expres-
sionless it was a lot for sheriff harker
to admit that he was human when he
wasnt official when he was alone

  no matter what happens sheriff
the swamp man said i reckon we ifh-
derstand each other if yo kill me daid
some day thats duty im not por
white im not quality course but im
not rat scamp er riveh-pirate

  im kinda sprised to meet yo spe-
cially the sheriff hesitated my ina
fomation was very direct reliable un-
questionable that yod been swallowed
up complete

  who told yo the swamp had sunk
me-if you dont mind tellin

  wetzel hatchie does that mean any-
thing special to yo-ifn i aint gittin too
dost an personal wing 

  i reckon he warnt regretful none
no suh i noticed that in particular
the sheriff said quietly fact is he
peared to take a great deal of personal
satisfaction-he an duck wamber did
well some men are glad to know
when somebody else has been killed up
dobussy said slowly i dont reckon
everybody was disappointed or dissatis-
fied about duck wamber sheriff

  no offense wing but thehs talk
that yo had strong personal reasons for
not begrudging either ducks er gran-
pap hatchies gittin killed up the
sheriff said slowly course i dont
say so mysef hits official records that
men served as shotgun labor an slept in


chains in a dark corner moonshine
stockade now ruined an shut down
i dont need sworn statements to be-
lieve that dobussy said

  wing dobussy i want to ask yo a
personal favor harder said tell me
confidentially ifn yo eveh know of that
kind in my territory agin yo got
friends i wish i had ive heard em lie
laugh turn down money-big money
-an a sick crow couldnt of been poorer
than them

 sheriff i want to deserve my
friends dobussy said yo know
those friends i have im forbidden to
pack a short-gun against a personal
merciless despicable enemy if i kill
him ill be hung for murder if he
shoots me down in the dark corner
hits justice and honorable

  shoots yo down wing dobussy
sheriff harker exclaimed

  wing brought out the empty money-
belt with its bullet-holes he laid three
-caliber bullets on the officers hand
he opened his shirt and showed the
scars on his back were the welts of
the blacksnake whip

  im dependin on yo to keep this
confidential wing said as he saw the
officer angrily squaring his shoulders

  no man can do that in my county
harker declared hoarsely wamber
did a bit of talking corroborative i
couldnt have believed hit i know those
bullets ive fired that fancy gun i
caint let yo take revenge in yo own
hands wing

  i dont ask yo to let me sheriff
dobussy assured him i jus told yo
plain an fair

  thats a nice carbine yo got wing
the sheriff indicated

  sure is a - dobussy added
duck was knocked down by a -
-it looked like

  kind of an old-fashioned caliber
mighty fine for timber deer and bear
shooting   harker remarked grand-
pap hatchie swore by his hit aint
been seen sincet he got killed up 
i looked into its muzzle sho was
bigs a stovepipe wing said good
gun to have hid out in case of business
sheriff 

they talked on the inevitable scat-
terings problems hundreds of wild-
crafters squatters natives living on fish
game herbs wild grapes nuts wild
honey frogs turtles and other swamp
bottoms by-products wing brought out
a writing-board with paper clipped to it
a relic of his student days he showed
harker the mississippi engineer report
that figured the area above hatchies
toll gate to be about one hundred fifty
thousand acres

  but hes got the law you know
harker shook his head

  no he hasnt dobussy denied
for a thousand years wild life has be-
longed to the king to the state and now

a boats coinin wing
exclaimed tilts the sher-
iff isbelle said
the blue book magazine

to the public thats the law what
hatchie has are the courts and legisla-
tors and police forces weve got a law-
yer for that-

you have i hadnt heard of that
perhaps theres a lot you havent
heard sheriff dobussy assured him
were trying to be legal first sevier
martines our attorney

  one of you boys killed duck wam-
ber the sheriff declared hotly do
you call that legal

  suppose a bandit holds you up on a
public highway with a gun and tells you
not to go home dobussy asked quietly
and he shoots holes in your boat if you
dont light out

  but this is hatchies land-its the
hatchie estate 

  thehs five homesteads all proved up
back here

  a few hundred acres harker cried
and murder in cold blood-

  was anything colder than wetzel
hatchie shootin me down wing
checked himself whitening and leav-
ing me to die slow and cruel

 well i dont blame you-much
sheriff harker said presently when he
had figured on it this means war in
the swamps im legal i have to abide
by the law as the corts interpret it
theyll hand me ejectments an ill come
doing my duty wing thehll be fight-
in shootin meanness raidin battles
i dont reckon we can be friends

  not be friends with the law an our
elected officials wing asked we got
right on our side all we want is whats
ours all that makes the trouble back
yeah is cheating

  i know   the sheriff sighed

in the morning dobussy showed the
sheriff out to the east fork and they
shook hands parting potential enemies
but when the cabin-boater returned to
his craft he found on the table under
the squat sugar bowl a paper which read 

sheriffs office
scattering courthouse
to whom it may concern

    know alt by these presents that i have-
  on this day november nd over my hand
  and seal appointed

           wing dobussy

  pires or he is removed

chapter fifteen

mendova club takes over

the mendova turkey club were
much surprised and badly discour-
aged when they turned back from the
dark corner their annual hunt before
christmas stopped short by the hatchie
estate guard and private preserve legal-
ity happily attorney bob ranger was
with them

  i tell you boys this is probly our
chance  ranger declared well just
go see that young hatchie ill bet if
we make him some kind of an offer hell
jump at the chance of giving ouh tur-
key club first whack in here well get
a club-license and take a club site-this
preservell improve conditions these
damned riveh-rats kill turkeys to eat
any time shoot ducks for market geese
for feathers deer any time they damned
well feel like it well have private hunt-
ing benefits an get more game pay no
more for lots better privileges

 accordingly the mendova turkey
club turned back to the mouth of the
albion on the way to see hatchie when
ranger and doctor scurtis as a commit-
tee went to the hatchie estate office in
scattering court they were very wel-
come wetzel hatchie was feeling poor-
ly but when he received the suggestion
of the mendova turkey club his fea-
tures lighted up visibly

  now thats surely opportune gentle-
men  he exclaimed heartily you say
youre authorized to transact business
gentlemen  as regards the hunting con-
cession i havent rightly made up my
mind i dont know-

  heres what we thought of suggest-
ing ranger handed him a paper and
when he read it hatchie nodded

  that seems perfectly fair-parties of
the first and second part hatchie said
everyone accepts and acknowledges
   conservation of wild life shooting
rights explicit that section regarding
unforeseen questions to be considered by
representative of each party who in turn
select a third for equitable adjustment
-fine now thats foresighted-

  they had lotus stalcum write down
the details and then they drew up a
contract and when it came to the es-
tates share as regards the purchase of
club memberships-duly acceptable to
the mendova turkey club and hatchie
estate both a fifty-fifty division of the
five hundred dollars received seemed
eminently fair


swamp angel

  just to be on the safe side ranger
carried the precious contract to men-
dova to put it in a safe-deposit vault
it was too valuable a paper to have kick-
ing around in a hunting-camp with con-
siderable hard liquor in the luggage
maybe hatchie wasnt aware of its im-
plications 

  in mendova ranger took the paper to
the cotton bottoms trust where he had
it photographed and recorded again as a
precautionary measure in case the coun-
ty clerks office at scattering court
should burn then he went to his office

  miss caprone his secretary greeted
him with a squeal of surprise but he ex-
plained his unexpected return she was
reading the first edition of the mendova
evening alert there waa the heading

no clue to murderer
scattering sheriff
unable to locate
hatchie estate
warden bush-
whacker in
swamps

  ranger looked down through the ac-
count squinting indignant helpless and
surprised

  td better have a talk right now with
hatchie ranger said hed better
show his hand when i call him he sho
had yes indeedy 

  wetzel did just that without hesita-
tion when ranger came strolling in on
him late on that same afternoon polite
serious and broad-minded in fact
hatchie took ranger home with him and
the two attorneys talked heart to heart
over everything with utmost frankness

  come to find out the sporting end was
only just the beginning of dark corner
business the fur-trapping showed per-
haps fifty thousand dollars maybe plenty
more than a hundred thousand dollars
some good seasons-rats mink coons
beaver otter possums and so on the
mussel shells were being looked into
sharp by burdock watkins-just one
pearl might bring five thousand dollars

  well hatchie im flabbergasted
ranger exclaimed my gawd yo
know i suttinly neveh dreamed of any-
thing like that lying dormant in those
swamp brakes ill promise you right
now that the mendova turkey clubll
sure see to it that those damned pot-hunt-
ers are brought up with a round turn
snubbed right  but now-about
duck wamber getting killed that was

pretty serious wetzel the mendova
club doesnt want to step into a feud
well about duck hatchie hesitat-
ed course sportsmen wouldnt find
any pleasure in the dark corner if they
were likely to be bushwhacked duck
told me all about it grandpap contract-
ed his distillery labor and you know how
they are white trash and negroes theyd
take twenty-five or fifty dollars advance
spend it and tfien try to run out on work
theyd agreed to do one of those con-
tract laborers was wing dobussy-some
such name duck had a fight with do-
bussy and naturally duck larruped him
good he was real enthusiastic about
such things duck was

  well dobussy served out his contract
but he always held it up against duck for
licking him maybe duck did kinda
overdo hit anyhow when dobussys
time was up an he pulled out he left
word that the sorriest day duck wam-
berd eveh git to know was the one he
blacksnaked a white man mebby too
thehs a swamp angel gal mixed up into
it duck neveh did have any pride
thataway course he was common him-
self you know the type

  duck was killed just when he was
holding the boats from going up the al-
bion i understand ranger said at the
preserve boundary

  thats so this killers right smart
thataway he wanted the sympathy of
the swamp angels so they wouldnt sell
out on him hatchie shook his head
thoughtfully he opened up the albion
temporarily to their trespassing and they
went on in to their boats-camps they
dont want trouble not with scouters not
with us we have the law sheriff judges
juries reputable sentiment everything in
our favor

  well of course none of our members
are exactly spring chickens when hit
comes to takin care of themselves wetz-
el ranger chuckled theyre plumb
peaceable and honorable but theyre
high-spirited too

members of the turkey club just
couldnt believe their luck there
they were liable to make big money out of
their fun  when they had celebrated the
happy ending of their panic at the fear
of losing the right to hunt in that great
wild country they headed into the brakes
and pitched their tents back in the west
fork flow where ridges gave wild tur-
keys oak acorns and wild grapes in abun-
dance-fattest biggest gobblers ever 
  the first day out dr scurtis killed a
gobbler with nine beards and it weighed
thirty-one pounds a great beauty for a
fact the weather was fresh the frost
staying on the ground in the gloomy
places the gobbler would keep for
christmas attorney ranger knocked
over a seventeen-pounder and a twelve-
pounder right and left jeremiah case
spotted a flock of wild geese coming low
overhead and put down four with his
automatic

as ranger was working over toward
 old mississip he saw probably the
biggest flock of wild turkeys he had seen
since he was a boy he planned a cam-
paign took his sneak and circled to head
them he saw the grandpap of gobblers
coming-and then over yonder somebody
began to whack and slap away with rifles
-little pops s or perhaps a -caliber
and the whole flock doubled back scat-
tered and ranger never even got a shot

  of course he was annoyed and lost his
temper sure enough it was just two
swamp angels two low-down white trash
boys-twenty-two or twenty-four years
old gaunt competent but sullen with
three birds

  why damn you ranger exclaimed
staring at the two hens and a nice eleven-
pound gobbler what the hell do you
mean hunting here-spoiling my shot at
the biggest gobbler i eveh saw dont
yo know this is a private preserve 
neither answered

  speak up you im arresting you for
trespass-

  by god yo caint  one exclaimed
drap that gun yo 

  ranger stood stunned staring-look-
ing into the muzzle of a - carbine re-
peating rifle aimed at his chest plumb
center the other youth leveled his gun
-a  repeater

  drap hit-er yo drap mister   the
other youth cried shrilly and ranger
eased his automatic shotgun to the
ground knowing hed better

  why oh hell boys i didnt mean
anything-

  yo lie one retorted yore lawyer
ranger hits yor business to lie trick
steal poor folks livins git goin offn
these bottoms-dont eveh come back
git aout stay gone ranger  this is
gun-muzzle notice mister this aint
no damned print-notice on a tree no in-
deedy

literally it was gun-muzzle notice
and when ranger backed away one of

the youths slipped around and picked up
the shotgun

  hue-ee-hits a automatic five-shot
take-down special  he cried swinging to
aim at the sportsman git goin er ill
prick yo plenty

  look out-she pulls easy  ranger
gasped starting to run this close itll
kill me

  git goin  the two yelled laughing to
see him run and when he was sixty
yards or so away the youth let go a
charge of shot-chilled sixes and ran-
ger gave a yell plastered in the back by
stinging pellets running raging and
helpless attorney ranger forgot to no-
tice in which direction he was going he
ducked and dodged thinking he was
pursued until at last breathless he real-
ized he was in the lonely bottoms on a
dull cloudy day and looking at his
wrist he discovered he had forgotten his
strap compass

  hurt in his skin and feelings both he
looked around he was on a ridge four
or five feet high wi th a cane strip ahead
of him along the back to his left he
could see water with swell-butt cypress
and tupelo gums in the soft muck and
shoals to his right he saw only the
spreading levels of cottonwood gums
red oaks he headed in that direction
and came to a wide lake with marsh and
trees in the slicks he turned in another
direction and found a deep green bayou
eddied-having no current he followed
it and came to a green-water stream nar-
row deep bridged by fallen trees and
jammed drift that wasnt the right di-
rection he turned back-and with
breath-taking suddenness black night
fell upon him cold raw miserable he
shouted but no answer came

  all night he ran around a tree keeping
warm physically and in a rage mentally
in the morning he headed off across
country keeping three trees in a line
ahead of him picking up another one
when he passed the nearest so keeping
going straight in half an hour he heard
distant gunshots-the booming of scatter
shells he yelled answer and sure enough
it was members of the mendova turkey
club looking for him

  i better not tell them ranger re-
flected we aint all signed up yet--if
they knew id been peppered and duck
wamber just killed up-ill just take
their guying at my being scairt and losing
my gun

 they worked back to the camp and
ranger changed his clothes covering up
the blood-spots where eight or ten shot
had hit him and stained his clothing he
was sore but he could take it in confi-

hold  sonien sheriff harker
piilled liis own lorty-flven tlie
fustes man who shoots ill who
sink i-jus suh

dence he told dr scurtis about the mat-
ter and the surgeon deftly picked out the
pellets using local pain-killer   

  turkeys were plenty and ranger had
his anyway on the following day the
party headed for mendova ranger and
scurtis stopped over at scattering court
fully authorized in writing to complete
the bargain as regarded bringing in one
thousand sportsmen to enjoy the exclu-
sive privileges of hunting over the dark
corner heretofore supporting none knew
how many people

wetzel hatchie was glad to make
the arrangement on a fifty-fifty
basis and he was perfectly frank 

  you understand gentlemen the prob-
lem of keeping poachers from interfering
is right serious you know they killed
duck wamber i reckon

  whats that-killed duck wamber
dr scurtis exclaimed 

  ranger gave hatchie the duty of ex-
plaining scurtis heard for the first time
that the superintendent gatekeeper had
been mysteriously and feloniously assas-
sinated scurtis was surprised and per-
turbed and ranger told hatchie how
he was held up and robbed of his shot-
gun and was peppered with it by two
youths when he caught them with three
wild turkeys stolen from the biggest
flock probably on the private preserve

  well have to make an example of
those scoundils hatchie declared an-



grily yoll testify to your experience
mr ranger

  yes indeed the attorney assured
him nobody can steal my gun holding
me up thataway then pepper me and
get away with it-and i a lawyer-but
what ill make a personal matter of it
the three left the brick office crossing
to county judge brooners chambers in
the court building they found the
judge a small dapper perky man with
dignity in proportion to his lack of
weight gravely he stood to welcome
them hatchie explained the situation

  we want warrants for trespass is-
sued against clem and huclc barston
hatchie said then we want john doe
and richard roe warrants for highway
robbers stealing an automatic and as-
sault with a deadly weapon same case
understand but we may want to spread
the matter a bit for effect you under-
stand

  miss stalcum filled in proper blanks
ranger signed the information then
judge brooner sent a trusty for sheriff
harker

  kind of important case sheriff
brooner said when harker arrived sit
down and ill explain it to you

  harker sat down and read the war-
rants without comment then he said 


the blue book magazine

from criminal homicide to stealin a gun
and trespass 

  i demand an explanation  declared
hatchie just where do yo stand

  with the law accordin to my oath
of office mist hatchie the sheriff an-
swered if you order it judge brooner

chapter sixteen

the posse calls

wing dobussy met isbelle strake
on the west fork she had been
down to scattering court trading the
two swung over into an island chute out
of the main channel and landed a flock
of mallards came flying swiftly by
bound upstream

  a boats coming  wing exclaimed
hits the sheriff isbelle said hat-
chie ranger doc scurtis and judge
brooner were figuring on bringing in the
barstons count of insulting that smart
lawyer and ignoring the trespass signs
then they actually mean business
hogging the dark corner  

  depends if harkers got a posse what
they decided on the swamp girl an-
swered thehs fine pints of law they
finally gave harker warrants john doe
and richard roe for felony and the two
barstons for misdemeanor trespass
id better go fair-warn the barstons  
theyre going to be easy caught she
said clem came in last night and i

asked astonished as they hid behind a
fallen cottonwood and watched the fast-
plowing boat go by

  course they mought make a mis-
take isbelle shook her head the
boys are all primed sensible i asked hit
as a personal favor of ouh friends to
srender this time

  you reckon lawin in a fixed courtll
do any good  dobussy asked

  yes indeedy thats jes hit she
exclaimed eagerly thataway evything
goes on the fecords they cant go behind
their own crooked works

  dobussy stared at isbelle strakes
shining eyes and face wondering and
puzzled how-come jhe had all that down
so plain those things he had been strug-
gling to know as well as feel

  im vengeful isbelle was all he
could say i mistrust these scoundrels
ifn once they lay hands put irons on
those barstons wrists lock them behind
the bars

  when isbelle had slipped away to go
home in the late evening as sunset drew
near dobussy-his outboard running
quietly and keeping close to the bank-
skulked on his way nobody could take
any chances or feel safe the way things
were in the dark corner

dobussy felt that sheriff harker
was honorable that he would re-
spect the secret of the hidden cabin-boat
nevertheless he dropped down the west
fork to highjack wagers fish-camp tent
and boats wager heard the outboard
when wing opened up his cut-out just to
let the swamp angel know he was com-
ing and wager came out

  howdy wager hailed answering
dobussys greeting sheriff harker an
five deputies went up this fork afteh

ing dobussy agreed thanks alive

  well what of it-special 

  grandpap hatchie always toted a
- nobody else through hyar had
one like hit nobodys heard a word
about hit sincet he was killed up in the
dark corner whereveh hit was

i m sure obliged to you for telling me 
 dobussy exclaimed

  us swamp angels all got to stick to-
gether now the fisherman explained
quietly we gotta chip in fo a damned
lawyer i paid a ten-spot tod him
mysef

  you did i hadnt heard about that
i want to sit in too who collected
course we aint sposed to tell not
the enemy or outside but i reckoned
yod know hits miss lotus stalcum
jedge brooners typewritin gal she told
isbelle strake the first thing she hearn
duck was killed up how serious hit was
she warned evybody not to say a word
not to talk not to light aout but to be
brave an hold ouh forts 

  she said that-miss stalcum

  yas suh in jes so many words
dobussy had a sociable cup of louisi-
ana drip coffee and went on his way
down the dark and winding waters a
faint reddish glow under the trees re-
vealed the tent of prat adkin the wil-
low-basketmaker the hour was pretty
late for him to be up but the lamp cast
a human shadow against the canvas-a
stranger and the hand of the shadow
had something in it

  why there he is showing prat that
- shell dobussy said to himself
and then he opened his cut-out instantly
prat came through the flaps greeting
howdy i got a strangeh visitin 
thankee prat for fair-warnin me
dobussy answered ir a low voice ifn
a man behaves himself he dont need to
fear anybody but mean scoundrels did
sheriff harker come with a posse
nots i seen up this fork-no county
boats went by prat answered he
afteh somebody 

  sho nough prat dobussy answered
significantly

  im the stranger the visitor said
emerging who are you 

  im jes a swamp angel dobussy
answered

  what started tie sheriff off this
time prat asked -if hit aint confi-
dential business

   bout noon harker went up the west
fork i reckon with his charges of insult
disrespect trespass an felonies dobussy
answered

  then-then theyre goin at hit
claimin possession aint they

  looks like-taking all the brakes all
the dark corner wing assented this
is their first big move

  well i reckon well have to take hit
prat sighed like hit or not-come hell
or high water 

  what i was going to say wetzel hat-
chie has hired himself a private detective
to come back in here finding out all he
can dobussy said probably hes a
good fellow personally but hes hired to
ask into all our private business the
constitution says no man can be made to
testify against himself

  so youre one of those swamp angel
pettifoggers big-mouthing the stran-
ger standing by exclaimed

  im just passing on advice given by
a competent attorney-at-law mister
dobussy retorted theres a limit to
legitimate prying and snooping into back-
home affairs even of swamp angels i
dont recommend that you trespass any
beyond it those turkey club tres-
pass notices dont cover all the possibili-
ties of vilation back heah in the swamps
suh well good night prat mind your
eye-see you agin  

  so long  prat exclaimed heartily as
wing let in the gears and shoved on into
the night

  as dobussys big skiff swung out of
the landing eddy into the current up-
stream he heard the stranger mumble a
question prat spoke up as if to be loud-
er than the noise of the motor

  whos that feller oh hes jes one
of those shanty-boaters i sho disremem-
beh his name them kind come in an
out all the time

  dobussy caught his breath prat he

realized was loyal

  driving his outboard along at a cruis-
ing speed seven or eight miles an hour
dobussy stopped along at two other
camps and at a shanty-boat giving every
one a fair warning about the detective
on the prowl and asking that the word
be spread back in the brush to the scout-
ers and those off the main ways

sundown was near when sheriff
harker ran his motorboat to the
bank and the six men went ashore they
had to cut across the bottoms to reach
the barston place and were in sight for
a mile before they reached the landing
they landed at a deer runway and fol-
lowed it over the neck and came to the
clearing with its two-story log house the
upper one the counterpart of the lower so
that when the overflow came the family
could move upstairs and tie their boats

to the outside stairway the boys were
at home sure enough

  just as the sheriff arrived looking over
the brush and driftwood fence having
come sneaking the barstons lifted three
big lumps out of a hole right before the
eyes of the posse the two shucked off the
clay-shells and revealed three turkeys
baked in that hole in the ground this
was supper-time-just coming sunset

  thehs corroborative evidence-three
turkeys  sheriff harker whispered to
undersheriff staunton

  howdy-yo sheriffers   clem bar-
ston turned suddenly and called if yo
fellers want sunthin to eat betteh come
git hit while hits hot 

  two of the deputies burst into a guf-
faw and the others stood up looking
sheepish and shamefaced they could
see the boys didnt even have on belt-
guns come to find out huck had seen
them coming around the short bend up
the meanders and so theyd prepared for
company hole-roast turkeys with three
kinds of dressing more hot-bread than
all the men could eat wild-grape jam
coffee yellow illinois butter jelly and
wild honey-they just ate and ate stead-

of course after supper when they
were all sitting around the fireplace
clem passed the tobacco-bowl with
pipes and when they were all settled
down clem like the backwoods gentle-
man he was made it just as easy as pos-
sible for the officer to perform his duty

    reckon yore after us barstons sher-
  iff harker the brother said formally

    yas suh-sorry bout hit boys
  harker said yove always ben friend-
  ly neveh no complaints about yo-
  till this lawyer ranger figured if
  we werent good business hed make us
  good business-that it  huck asked

    well-i caint try the merits of the
  case boys ill read the warrants-

    he read the two barston papers they
  charged trespass and were signed by
  robert ranger attorney for the men-
  dova turkey club all looked at the
  two brothers

    sheriff if yo make this arrest are
  you responsible or is the man who swore
  out the information and those he acted
  for responsible clem asked

    boy thats a legal question staun-
  ton exclaimed admiringly

    the one who initiated the proceed-
ings harker answered hes respon-


hold on nntchic wo liit
tor go n bit slow kangei
spoke in a low voice

 ily no use monkeying with business till
 they had filled up according to the boys
 sheriff harker had tried to tell them he
 was there professionally but they just
 shushed him up apparently knowing all
 about it	
sible i dont know anything about it
course anything ycu say cn be used
against you-were all legal witnesses
that suits us if yo dont commit
perjury clem barstow observed grimly
suppose yore on yor own land inher-
ited proved up taxes paid and all an a
man comes along witli an automatic shot-
gun draws down on yo in a threatening
manner uses abusing an scoundrelly
language-would yo reckon self-defence
conditions prevail 

  whats that-ranger want on your
own land was he asked sheriff harker
what do yo mean anyhow

  i mean just that huck said yo
men heard those warrants read that we
were trespassin on pri vate propty thats
perjury we own this half-section of
timber here mr sheriff this is ouh
home im fair-warnin yo we arent
goin to be arrested and lugged offn our
own propty on perjury invasion an as-
sault of our home nor to satisfy any
lawyer drummin up business among
peaceable honorable poor white folks
is that plain 

  who-who advised you  you got le-
gal ideas sheriff harker asked

  none of yo business who our law-
yers is huck countered promptly
whats more dont come into these
swamps with crooked court conspiracy
papers to deprive us of our propty
rights our civil rights and all our otheh
rights accordin to the constitution
statutes and common laws as provided
suh the ony reason yore here tonight
is on account of were peaceable to a
certain extent not because yo invaded
when yo come invadin with crooked pa-
pers yo aint legal any more 

  you boys have me stumped harker
admitted frankly yo sho got legal
advice i reckon staunton yo and cole
sparks better go back to the cort and
explain the situation to judge brooner
hell get in touch with ranger-some
attorney sho has treed us 

the two brothers grinned staunton
grumbled but went with sparks for
the long cold ride back down the wind-
ing west fork of the albion embar-
rassed nonplused the three posse-men
who remained wriggled uncomfortably

  hits a long night clem barston
said we all betteh go to bed an-
otheh day is cornin choose yo own
beds gentlemen 

  five beds were in ihe room one at the
end opposite the fireplace and two on

each side sheriff harker took off his
belt with its two holsters and hung up
his big coat which sagged with the
weight of - shells in boxes of twenty
the deputies followed suit neither of
the boys had any guns on them in ten
minutes the fire was banked and all were
in their bunks but perhaps not asleep
they had plenty to think about those
officers and swamp angels

first the posse knew it was morning
clem calling them to the kitchen for
breakfast the sun just shimmered on
the frost hot-bread fried fresh razor-
back chops coffee sour-milk to drink
sweet for coffee and cornbread after
breakfast they went outdoors

  lets go oveh here   huck suggested
blocks took them over the fence pro-
tecting the garden and quarter of a mile
in the brakes the barstons stopped and
faced the sheriff and his posse

  around a big gum tree just clear of
the roots was a scuffed runway ring
where someone had run around the
stump hundreds of times sheriff har-
ker gazed at the mute evidence of a lost
man exercising all night long keeping
warm a slow smile suffused the officers
rotund countenance his eyes twinkling

  now huck harker turned inquir-
ing course i aint askin yo to testify
against yoursef i aint trickin yo
nothing like that jes confidentially
not officially not for no legal purposes
id sho take hit friendly ifn yol tell
me jes zactly what did happen

 well- huck barston hesitated
course i caint testify-not evything
but-ill jes show yo 

  turning toward the north line of the
woods half-section they came to where
the homesteaded ridge sloped down
toward the tupelo-cypress growths mark-
ing the soft wet ground

  thehs man-tracks huck indicated
yo cn see where he run down that-
away struck water turned over east and
came to the blocked bayou an his
tracks circle all around every which way
through there he never got moren a
mile er so in any drection ifn hed jes
stopped to listen hed heard the missis-
sippi kinda comical-in a way
who gave you all the legal advice
harker asked trying again

  none of yo business sheriff huck
grinned though his eyes were narrowed
and had a hard sparkle thats what we
call confidential lawyerin i reckon i
done answered that one
the blue book magazine

  the sheriff colored but chuckled too
the trappers were shrewdly advised
and attorney ranger for all his acu-
men had made plenty mistakes in his
fall from professional to human emo-
tions other errors were indicated too
when the boys showed sheriff harker no-
tices of the dark corner private pre-
serve posted along the mississippi river
bank enclosing the homesteaded land of
the barstons realization of the inclu-
sion of private property in the hatchie-
mendova club project was shown when
on toward noon undersheriff staunton
wetzel hatchie and attorney ranger ar-
rived at the two-story trappers cabin

hatchie strutted to the two broth-
ers with his hand out smiling but
clem put both hands behind him

 we want to know what you want
mist hatchie we aint friendly
why boys no need of hard feelings
hatchie said smiling but coloring too
ive decided to buy your holdings-
unable to meet their straight stares
he looked around they were in the
midst of utterly virgin timber red gums
of highest export quality huge sound
oaks some three hundred acres of prime
timber the logging of it would bring
hundreds of dollars an acre done right
he could hardly pay too high a price
for it

  we dont want any trouble boys-no
use of hard feelings  hatchie turned
his ivory cheeks showing pink ill give
ten dollars an acre-say three thousand
dollars cash money for this place-a
quit-claim

  you go to hell clem retorted hotly
you know damned well we can sell this
timber any time we get ready for ten-
fifteen thousand stump price no suh
this place aint fo sale

 oh come now there isnt any-
thing from mens souls to property that
isnt for sale 

  i reckon-lawyer-honor er govment
propty fur shells fish birds-yod sell
anything yo dont own-sell yor soul
but whod want a soul like yourn mist
hatchie-the devil

  who the hell yo talkin to  hatchie
drew his revolver partly out-but the
trappers were faster with their short-bar-
reled automatic trap-line pistols

  hold on gemen   sheriff harker
pulled his own old forty-fives as he
stepped back to get clearance the
fustes man who shoots ill sho sink im
with soft-nose lead-yas suh 

  the brothers and hatchie and ranger
who had backed up at the gunplay rolled
their eyes to look into the forbidding
muzzles of the laws guns and restrained
whatever impetuous ideas they had had
of settling their antagonisms right there
and then

  drap those guns-all of em-on the
floor not in yo holsters boys  sheriff
harker ordered and five short-guns were
eased to the ground

  yo boys better sell right now ran-
ger declared we need this tract fo
an outlying club-camp contacting the
riveh-and turkey land

  taint for sale clem shook his
head obdurately

  i fair-warn yo  bob ranger said
thehs a flaw in yo title ill advise
yo honestly-on my honor nine years
ago yo didnt pay the levee bond as-
sessment the mendova club owns that
tax-sale title ifn yo fight well fo-
close an then yo wont git anything
this half-section is ouhs right now-
the lips of the two brothers parted
their faces whitening and their confi-
dent pose wilted always the old levee
bond scandal had hung over the bottoms
though the levee never had been built
the issue had been a fraud blit the leve
district had paid interest on the bonds
and the matter had slept in courts and
in schemers vaults for years attorney
ranger had selected the bonds filing
claims in the county clerk office of scat-
tering court- jes sos well have lever-
age when it comes to argue the lawyer
had said

  can these fellers steal the land dad
proved up fifty years ago sheriff  clem
turned to the officer cn they hold us
up thisaway 

  hatchie and ranger turned to stare
with deep meaning at the sheriff whose
rotund countenance drew in grim lines

  i dont advise them to boys har-
ker said quietly thehs such a thing as
sef-defence in the constitution ifn it
comes to stealing a mans lands same as
any other property fur as my office is
concerned

  by god sheriff-do you invite mur-
der  hatchie screamed

  then well begin court proceedings
of dispossess mr hatchie  ranger
turned with dignity the sheriffll
serve court papers course

  court orders- and sheriff harker
sighed ill have to-or resign but
dont make any mi stakes you two i
represent law


swamp angel

  hold on hatchie  we better go a
bit slow  ranger spoke in a slow
voice we got to get our law right-
firstest

  reckon well all go boys sheriff
harker added his voice hollow with
anxiety as he followed the deputies who
trailed after hatchie and ranger

  sherf  clem barston called to har-
ker yo all betteh take the guns of
these yeah raidin quality 

  barston carried the three weapons
ranger and hatchie had dropped to the
floor and the sheriff nodded approving-
ly for this was common sense

  thank yo boys i wont foget yo
did this  the officer said im neutral
course but im sho proud yo boys held
yoselves in-provoked the way yo was

  the single file of men dragged over
the fence blocks and followed the old
land trace toward the albion river fork
presently the barstons heard the throb-
bing of two motorboats heading down the
winding stream

  well i reckon hits good-by home
huck clem shook his head

  course theyll law us to death
huck assented

chapter seventeen

lawed to death

no one made a sound as judge way-
ling finished reading the courts de-
cision just the attorneys who had
flocked with the judge on his circuit
showed in narrowing eyes and slight
flashes of grins as they stirred and set-
tled uneasily their satisfaction that the
old boy had done it again

  beyond the railing the swamp angels
and outsiders looked blankly at one an-
other it wouldnt come to them at
once what it was all about just what had
been decided who had won the doings
of the courts and attorneys-at-law were
learned mysterious and perhaps most of
them never would know what exactly had
happened

  the two barston brothers sat within
the railing being litigants when the
learned and honorable judge had turned
the last page affixing his signature he
looked up to bring his bitocals to bear on
the other papers in the case for he very
meticulously kept everything all accord-
ing to the legal hoy le-as he would say
in jovial moments

  attorney martine turned to the bar-
stons and whispered weve lost boys

  that means this wetzel hatchie gits
ouh place clem asked

  yes

  they cn run us out now mr mar-
tine

  yes judge broonerll order sheriff
harker to dispossess you

  well course we knowed what to ex-
paict clem barston sighed and the
others nodded hit sho was friendly
mist martine cornin in thisaway to
hep us por folks that damned scoun-
drel fined yo fo fightin our fight
hyars the money we got a lit cash
suh-

  martine grew tense as he blinked he
had not expected that he had been
fighting alone so long that he had not
realized that the indignant scorn and
anger of his fellow-attorneys was not
everywhere shared lotus stalcum had
tried to encourage him in his quixotic re-
fusal to stand in with the court chasers
the swamp angels understood-they
counterbalanced the scorn of the others

  the spectators saw the judge fill his
brief-case and in his grand complacent
manner move for the chambers they
saw the host of attorneys heading to con-
gratulate the old boy on his handling of
that delicate and important case

  the lawyers had had their say the
court had had its say all the swamp
angels the men women children who
had seen two of their members lose title
to thousands of dollars worth of lands
they had occupied and their father had
occupied more than fifty years-imagine
any courts not recognizing their rights
to fur fish game all the eats they had

  pretty tired after being in town hav-
ing so much excitement and being so
busy the swamp angels drew toward
the levee street slowly and strung out
scuffling along heading toward their
landing at the long reverse-current eddy
on the mississippi above the fish dock
toting their burlap cotton and willow
basket carry-alls with their supplies go-
ing homeward

down at the landing they broke up
into little groups looking over their
shoulders back at the levee above which
they could see the low roofs of houses
some peaked some hipped and others flat
and the big white cupola of the red brick
courthouse with its big alarm bell up-
stairs windows like staring white eyes
the great white columns and the top bal-
cony where lawyers were leaning on the
white railing admiring the scenery and
talking things over shaking their heads
with pride and emphasis

  from the white pole hung the flag
fluttering in the waning sunshine above
the autumnal leaves of the trees in the
courthouse square park they always
hung up the flag on court days-just
kind of a habitual custom harking away
back yonder into the old days and kept
up except for a while when the times
were disputatious parlous and whooping

  weather-wise gaze turned to the mid-
day milkiness of the sky and the great
halo circle around the sun like a frame
which might mean a storm in a day or two
-a weather-breeder-couldnt be sure
it might blow away in a dry wind in-
stead of a rain

as the boats headed stringing away up
 the mississip from the landing
eddy the steam packet kate adams
swung in and stopped at the scattering
court landing to load sixty or seventy
bales of cotton nine mules live cane-
rooters crates of chickens and whatever
passengers were going out

  the roustabouts-double-shuffling
darkies-sang their marching tune cake-
walking under boxes of coffee bales of
dry-goods hardware nail kegs barrels of
sugar whatever was coming or going
presently when the old kate cut loose
the big engine soughing and coughing
the stern wheel thudding and splashing
she headed down the wide glistening yel-
low current of the placid-looking missis-
sippi visitors and townspeople watching

  the last swamp angel was gone and a
string of skiffs and canoes towed by an
outboard was just flickering around the
point at the head of the eddy up the cross-
ing attorney bob ranger turned to wet-
zel hatchie beaming with complacent
satisfaction

  sure is fine he exclaimed afteh
all the rumpusing and the threatening of
the storm and difficulty to have every-
thing flatten down thisaway wetzel sure
is gratifying yo know thehs lots of
bark an snap in those swamp angels if
they dont know their place when they
looked upon the determined front the
august majesty of the law they realized
how useless it was for ignorant ornery
no-count white trash to cope with the in-
tellectual courage the deserving compe-
tence the trained legal minds of superior
mentalities they felt the difrence
they couldnt help but see it yas suh
hatchie this yeahs the best example i
eveh saw of the natural fundamental

unmistakable differences between the
high-class professional quality and abil-
ity and the ornery low-down and de-
graded classes

  wetzel hatchie started to speak but
hesitated looking up the bottoms in the
direction of the dark corner the mid-
day warmth had lasted till late-the sun
was dimming now and out of the north
a chill breath came upon them both
men shivered

  right smart of the legal fraternity
stayed over hatchie said we ought to
show the hospitality of our great private
preserve ranger we could go kill a
buck and a razorback--have a barbe-
cue-

  now thats an idea ranger de-
clared nothing could please me better
i was just wishing i could go out and
relax enjoy the swamp brake look over
our domain of wild-life and recreation
weve definitely for all time devoted to
the love of sportsmanship nature-the
reward of the deserving um-m-fine

  they headed briskly over the levee
up past the courthouse and on to the
hatchie mansion pausing merely to make
sure that the visiting attorneys judge
wayling sheriff harker and other not-
ables understood they were to share the
triumph at a barbecue on saturday eve-
ning up at the preserve line at the nar-
rows and enjoy the combined hospital-
ity of wetzel hatchie bob ranger and
the executives of the mendova turkey
club not exactly celebrating-they
were modest of course-but just being
hospitable and showing an open house

in the sporting-room of the hatchie
mansion hatchie and ranger chose
arms equipment for the wild-meat hunt
for the barbecue they changed to hunt-
ing-clothes and on the mansion bayou
they embarked in the varnished pirogue
with everything amidships-even to car-
tons of favorite cigarettes a wide choice
of liquid refreshments native and im-
ported and staples in quantity they
had of course details regarding the estab-
lishing of the preserve getting everything
down right now that they had things in
their hands the way they wanted them

  the albion was clear green beautiful
on that late friday evening the pirogue
swift and as graceful as a wood duck
swept up the winding bends and cut the
emerald reaches in the brief twilight
they switched on a powerful battery spot-
light and they saw the tents with lan-
terns in them saw shacks on the banks-
swamp angels living below the preserve
line on timber holdings and close-in plan-
tation lands they exchanged smiles of
congratulations as they discussed their
easy victory-passing slow craft bound
into the back country the occupants
silent and dejected in the consciousness of
their defeat no one even hailed them
as they passed

  the two men landed at the float where
they slid alongside and quickly heaved
the hamper bags and firearms out of the
pirogue and then carried their duffle up
the gangplank over the bank into the

hunting-cabin and river watch-house of
the club

  they stood silhouetted by the high-
power gasoline lantern on top of the
bank their shadows thrown down on the
quivering flow of the stream they could
hear the pounding of small motors up
stream and down--the going home of the
swamp angels who had been ordered to
evacuate with their outfits their chattels
and removables-up the bank and down
the waters

  a good riddance  ranger remarked
absently listening to the night sounds
the blue book magazine

we cn bring in respectful honorable
help wholl know their places-

  we sure can  hatchie spoke quiet-
ly we better go out with our head-
lights and make sure of our meat for the
barbecue reckon we need a big buck an
a young razorback-two-year-old say 
lets go ranger exclaimed and a
few minutes later they headed out into
the brakes along the backbone ridge
from the narrows

  presently after just a little while the
rolling boom-ponk of a shot returned to
the river a little later came three ponk-
ponk-ponks rifle-shots in the night the
echoes wandered hither and yon smart
uppety taunting sounds-killing big
meat just for the fun of it that was the
sound of it

on saturday the sky was sunny
balmy and autumnal a better day
for the barbecue couldnt have been
chosen the visitors remaining over and
the local people were abroad early in the
morning sauntering along in leisurely
pairs or small groups enjoying the great
charm of a perfectly delightful glorious
day in scattering court

  shuffling through the leaves fallen from
abundant shade trees the attorney circuit
riders strolled along the best streets and
across the courthouse square they
needed the exercise to whet their appe-
tites for the hospitality of their hosts
wetzel hatchie bob ranger and the
mendova turkey club up the albion

  sheriff harker and several deputies or-
ganized the boat parade which was led
by the big county launch and all the avail-
able lesser craft when the fleet had
been assembled and the hour of em-
barkation arrived the throng came down
from the bank out onto the hatchie float-
ing boathouse and landing-stage the
swift and orderly despatch astonished
everyone and when the long fleet headed
through the arched bayou and out into the
albion the powerful launches towing
strings of skiffs and the swift craft tem-
pered their speed to the common gait of
a little more than seven miles per hour

  no one would ever forget that ride up
the albion with the trees sifting down
yellow leaves swirling in the varying
breezes out over the emerald-green water
birds calling squirrels barking

  they saw a school of alligator gars
rolling their ugly heads flocks of black
cormorants nigger geese in v-formation
undulating like long black ribbons against
the white sky aglow with diffused sun-

  shine and high against the zenith a flock
  of sandhill cranes flashed like winged jew-
  els in the silvery light they jumped
  flocks of mallards which raced on ahead
  of them for a few hundred yards drop-
  ping down into another eddy to be dis-
  turbed again

    they saw no tern nor shack no craft
  nor any swamp angel it was as if even
  the open country below the dark corner
  preserve had been abandoned by the
  squatters and homesteaders sheriff
  harker kept his head turning to survey
  the long banks squinting under his wide-
  brimmed hat at familiar deer-stands
  and two or three places along he looked
  to see somebody but nobody was along
  the way watching the big party go by

    they came in sight of the old ferry
  crossing of the green cane ridge road
  and the bulge up the long low hill with
  the opening on the right bank as they
  approached they saw the bright new cab-
  in and other structures at the line of the
  private preserve marking the entrance

    no one was on the float-landing nor at
  the top of the bank where they had ex-
  pected to be greeted by their hosts

    toot the whistle  the sheriff gave
  the order one of the deputies pulled the
  cord and the shrill piercing blast jfh-
  nounced the coming of the party only
  the echoes replied something like mock-
  ery and cackling in the reverberations

    the sheriff steered up to the head of
  the barrel float and a deputy stepped out
  on the wharf holding the county-launch
  line harker and all hands on board
  climbed over the splashboard and the
  sheriff led the way climbing the stairs
  up to the level of the bottoms he looked
  at the little lodge he glanced over at the
  storehouse and around as he walked into
  that quiet and deserted opening in the
  heavy brake and then he stopped short
  gasping for breath

  partly behind the buildings and
  inconspicuous among the scattered
  shade trees was a pecan with a good fork
  in it in the fork rested a gambrel pole
  extending twenty feet or so to a large set
  post about twelve feet from the ground
  where game was hung on gambrel sticks
  by trace chains or ropes

     at the end of the pole at the post hung
  a huge striped yellow and black razorback
  hog a two-year-old prime porker and a
  long-legged swamp buck deer game that
  had been killed for the barbecue

    in the middle of the peeled hickory
pole about five feet apart two bright new

swamp angel

three-quarter-inch ropes had been tied
with two half-hitches and a bight around
the line these lines led straight down
to the necks of two men where six-inch-
long hangman nooses had been drawn
tight on their throats so that their bodies
dangled in the terrible limp relaxation of
those who are hanged by the neck until
dead

  sheriff harker swayed and took quick
steps to save himself from falling over

  wetzel hatchie he whispered al-
most whistling and leaning to look more
keenly he sighed with breathless finality
bob ranger

  he hardly noticed the sound of climb-
ing footsteps nor the rustle and smack
of the soles of those who came hurrying
to join him but stopped short when they
saw what he saw and knew what he knew
men sighed and gasped and women be-
gan to utter sharp little cries which grew
louder and became a chorus of shrieks
and sobs

all stopped short of the burly heavy
k figure of sheriff harker the whole
throng who had come to the barbecue
huddled together around the back of the
chief executive of scatterings county

  sheriff harker never did a better days
work than he did getting all those people
back to town except just him and the
posse the bodies were taken to the
town right away the coroner and authori-
ties being right there to make it all legal
and according   

  yes sir there never was finer funerals
in all this part of the country and pop-
ular too evybody turning out and no
expenses spared mr rangers remains
was taken out yonder somers but wetzel
hatchie was interred local at scattering
court along by his family plot in the
graveyard at the headstone for grand-
pap but they took the statue offn the
base on account of wetzel never paid for
it and come to settle the estate come to
find out the hatchie house and local
properties belonged to miss stalcum on
account of legalities relating to the mur-
der of her father and the chicaneries re-
lated thereto

  well suh it was sure surprising all
them circumstances um-m course
sheriff harker and his posse-men pulled
up their belts and rared out into the
dark corner looking for them scoundrels
who did that meanness the law was
terribly provoked time and again he
headed in but the pcssed no moren get

the

 started than word echoed up the albion
 somehow spreading out through the
 brakes-and it seemed like thataway the
 swamp angels always knew who was
 coming and when the officers located the
 camps and outfits shacks and raghouses
 cabins and shanty-boats or where-so-
 evers nobodyd be to home it appeared
 like nobody wanted to testify to any-
 thing anybody really would like to know j

   of course the scatterings is what you i
 might call wild country sports go in
 there roust around a while mebby shoot-
 ing a wild turkey or getting a buck ven-
 ison catching a mess of big-mouth greet
 trout just kind of sporting you know
 not aiming to stay any length of time to
 speak of or make any serious business
 of it they say they got some fine ethi-
 cal sporting game and fish laws for them
 kinds to live up to real honorable and
 seasonable

   thereve been fellers gone in there
 rousting raring flustering around bigs
 all get out but they quiet down presently
 or they come stepping out kind o awry-
 eyed looking for somewheres else right
 hurried what happened  oh nothing
 any one could lay tongue to definite-
 it just aint a place for performances
 seems to be you know how places aint
 like one another in some particulars

   nobody gets shot up there exactly-
 unless just confidential nobody settles
 down either claiming to own a fishing
 bend or taking up trapping or hornswog-
 gling the shells seining the spawning beds
 of the fish hogging anything in general
 or particular-not against popular opin-
 ions then course taint a place for in-
 terfering-thats the main thing i reckon
 minding your own business

   no suh stranger personally up and
 down old mississip and these contribut-
 ing streams back into the hills and over
 the prairies as well as in the overflows
 theres lots of open country plenty of it
 -but just along here from up above the
 old stillhouse down to blow the riveh-
 mouth say along by the court landing
 its all right to tie in for a night or two
 or riding out a wind but as for locating
 -um-m-id say its done took up

  a world war pilot gives us this
  fascinating story of daring espio-
  nage the second in the adven-
  tures of the legless legion-
  a group of rehabilitated veterans
  organized by wealthy mel service
  into a daring intelligence corps

by

tracy
richardson

  a s the flashes of the anti-aircraft
 shells were left behind flight
f- lieutenant coulter-brown re-
laxed a bit and eased himself on
his seat-pack chute he wiped his fore-
head free of perspiration and checked his
instruments cruising at twenty thou-
sand feet the outside temperature was
registering thirty-two below but inside
the closed cockpit protected by his elec-
trically wired flying-suit it was comfort-
ably warm  and the tricky flying he had
been forced to do during the last barrage
had not cooled him down a particle
now it would be clear sailing-until they
hit the next aerial barrage

  they were flying on oxygen he spoke
to his photographer-observer lieutenant
linton through the interplane phone its
mouthpiece an integral part of their oxy-
gen masks so they could talk without re-
moving that important accessory

  howd you like that burst of hate
linton 

  a little bit of all right what been
too bad if theyd had our line of flight
as close as they did our altitude ill bet



i	got a picture of every aa gun within
ten miles of the holland border what
do you make of our position 

  that crooked streak down there is
the ems river well be over meppen
in about a minute-and ill be glad to
get past that spot its a tough baby
there they go again shouted lieu-
tenant linton as flashes speckled the
darkness above them about a thou-
sand feet high and short gad looks
like a swarm of fireflies down below
ill get some good negatives of this
flying lieutenant coulter-brown was
busy trying to keep track of the burst-
ing anti-aircraft shells so that he might
change his course when they came too
near he was throttled down until they
barely had flying-speed making it better
for pictures but more difficult for the de-
tectors on the ground to pick them with
any degree of accuracy    strangely
enough when the trouble came it was
from above not below a piece of archie
shell crashed through the nose of the
plane smashing part of the instrument
panel
uke a giant bat they bored into the darkness then lights
sprang at them from below and ahead criss-crossing

  there was a jar as it struck a draft
of cold winter air surged into the cabin
and both motors quit without even a
warning gurgle both propellers quivered
to a standstill rapidly the pilot made
adjustments and then pressed the starter
switch nothing happened the galva-
nometer on the instrument-board was
dead and he realized that the piece of
shell had cut their vital ignition-system

  everything was deathly still in the
cabin outside they could hear the ex-
ploding shells searching for them no
time to lose he shouted to linton

were going down but if we can make
it to meppen weve got a chance i have
friends there get out your films and
put em in your pocket well jump to-
gether and try to land that way weve
got an actual service-condition chance to
try out that double parachute drop the
special service unit has been practicing
wed better pray it works as well now as
it does in practice itd be a fine howdy-
come-do to have them jam together now
itll work though-never fear    im
setting the controls so the ship will glide
and before she lands a time-bomb will
go off i hope theyll think we burned
with the wreck

  all right said linton a moment lat-
er ive got the films stowed away im
ready whats our altitude

  down to sixteen already out you
go

  linton slid back the hatch-cover and
clambered out onto the wing coulter-
brown pulled the safety pin from the
bomb turned a cock from the gas-tanks
so the cabin would flood and hastily
joined linton outside each grasped
the others belt firmly with one hand



while the other hand engaged the ring
of the ripcord now  shouted coulter-
brown and they dived into space

  cold biting air rushed past them
burning their cheeks it was like stand-
ing on the prow of a fast speed-boat and
heading into a biting gale coulter-
brown counted one and two and one
and two and one and two- every
count meaning a second and each second
a certain number of feet closer to the
ground the flashes of the anti-aircraft
guns were springing up at them at a
great rate seeming to encircle them
brown twisted his hold on lintons belt
linton turned his heaid nodded as one
their hands moved downward little
pilot-chutes shot out and dragged the
big billowing chutes after them there
came a jerk that nearly wrenched them
apart and they were floating gently the
terrific body-pressure relieved

  gad brown said and realized he
couldnt hear he pinched his nose with
his free hand and blew his ears crack-
led and popped then opened and he
heard linton say

  if they line one of those searchlights
on us its good night    mister weve
got something in this double-parachute
jump couldnt have worked better
theyre looking too high replied
coulter-brown    well be dowm in a
minute we must hang together to the
end well heres hoping better not
talk any more they might hear us

they could see the earth now but it
was hard to judge its distance for
patches of snow gave everything a mot-
tled appearance ljke a crazy-quilt they
had to pull their shroud-lines to avoid
landing in a tree-then they were down
easy on soft snow and a wall breaking
th drag of the wind on their chutes

  now said lieutenant coulter-
brown lets get out of this parachute
harness get to the other end and fold
em toward the middle and roll em tight
got to make em small as possible so
theyll look like a duffle-bag or some-
thing of that sort there isnt a place
here where we could bury them or any-
thing like that so well have to take that
much of a chance

  just as they had about completed
rolling the chutes into a compact bun-
dle there came a terrific explosion off to
the south and the sky was lighted as
though by a giant flare

  that said lieutenant coulter-
brown sadly was he end of a per-
fectly good photographic ship every
german patrol within miles will be rush-
ing over there for the next thirty min-
utes so its up to us to get set before that
time these chutes make it sort of awk-
ward but we cant leave them behind-
theyd be a dead give-away all set
lets go its half a mile from here al-
most across from the railway station
probably the toughest spot in the town
you know this place asked the
astonished lieutenani linton

  yes thats why im flying this spe-
cial photographic mission i know this

  border from  william shaven to switzer-
land as well as i know the strand now
just pray no one thinks it strange to see
two men in flying-suits trotting along the
streets at night better take off your
helmet-its too british this is the first
time ive ever blessed the blackout but
if it were light we wouldnt last two min-
utes what with the patrols air-raid
wardens secret police and all if theres
any talking to do ill handle it-t know
the local german

  there was a lot of activity on the
streets through which they passed jog-
ging along as though under orders to get
somewhere in a hurry coulter-brown
turned off just before they came to the
railway station and gavie the bell-pull of
the corner house a hearty jerk then sev-
eral more short pulls the side of the
house where they were standing was in
deep shadow and it was almost impos-
sible to see when the door opened but a
womans voice spoke to them in ger-
man  yes  what is it 

  coulter-brown leaned forward and
spoke softly in german christine its
jerry brown and a friend

  a stifled exclamation came from the
darkness and linton felt browns hand
drawing him in through the doorway
the door closed behind them silently
and a bolt shot home they walked
down a short dark passageway and into
a room dimly lighted with a shaded bulb
the woman turned peered intently into
coulter-browns face and threw her
arms around him

  jerry jerry in gods name what
are you doing here oh i know you
were in one of those planes they were
firing on thank god you got down
safe but you are in a terrible place
meppen is alive with soldiers the se-
cret police are everywhere one can
hardly move and theyve cut us off from
all communication with the dutch bor-
der hermans out on duty-hes an air-
raid warden hell be back at midnight
so youd better go down and wait she
looked inquiringly at lieutenant linton

coulter-brown introduced linton
without explanation and that puz-
zled officer followed as christine led
them into a back room then into a closet
you know what to do she said id
like to sit and talk and talk but ill have
to wait here till herman comes in ill
send him down as soon as possible

  she closed the closet door leaving
them in darkness a second later lin-
  ton felt the floor sinking beneath him
he grabbed the arm of coulter-brown
who chuckled just a stairway being
lowered linton actually the closet
floor is a stairway that unfolds and can
be operated only when the closet door is
closed    here we are now for the
lights

as the moving stairway came to a halt

 a light sprang up revealing a
strange-looking room-a sort of work-
shop laboratory and living-room com-
bined they stepped off the stairs and
at once it slowly rose back into the ceil-
ing and a heavy beam swung into posi-
tion locking it into place

  come on said brown as he laughed
at lintons stupefaction first lets
shed some of this flying-outfit and get
rid of these chutes might as well make
ourselves comfortable for well probably
be here several days

  gad i say brownie dyou mind
giving me a little light about all this
what are you anyway-an intelligence
officer  this is certainly one up on me
linton if you hadnt been all right
youd never have been assigned to spe-
cial service but you must never men-
tion a single thing you see here not even
to those you know in the service if one
little leak got out about this it would
mean the death of dozens of good men
and women suffice for the moment that
this is part of a veterans organization
devoting their lives to the welfare of the
empire i know about it because my
father is one of them ive spent a great
deal of time in this part of germany so

i	know the key men

  i see-a branch of the intelligence
service i certainly dont envy them
their jobs if this is a fair sample

  no they are not members of any
government service in fact government
doesnt know officially that such an or-
ganization exists its a commercial
organization that has adapted itself to
war-time necessity theyll play a tre-
mendous part though entirely unsung
in this war ill tell you more about it
when we get back to england

  you feel sure well get back  there
was a hopeful look in lintons eyes

  well said coulter-brown confident-
ly if we dont it will be because the
legion of legless men have lost their
combination and believe me they
havent its going to be hard going
though    here take a look at this
wall map

l

  he turned to a large-scale map that
showed that section of germany border-
ing on holland arid belgium as well as
all of those two countries

  you see this salient below meppen
theres a railway running from here
down to the zuyder zee this salient
and down where the rhine enters hol-
land at bemmel are the two shortest
routes to cut into holland if they should
strike from here and get down to the
zuyder zee theyd control not only the
sea but the frisian islands as well and
that would give them a perfect base from
which to attack england from the
looks of things i think thats what they
are preparing to do-strike a lightning
blow before its expected well know
more about that when we get your nega-
tives developed

  theyll be old before we have the
chance to do that-and yesterdays war-
news is ancient history

  a red light flashed on in the ceiling
there was the faintest sound from the
direction of the stairway and linton
watched with astonishment as the closet
floor above came slowly down unfolding
into a perfect stairway standing on
the bottom step was a typical german
of the small towns he peered intently
at them then stepped forward with hand
outstretched linton noticed that one
of his legs was a wooden peg that pro-
truded from his pants-leg

  jerry  exclaimed the german as he
stumped forward and grasped the out-
stretched hand if this post never did
another thing its paid for itself this
night was that your plane that blew
up out south of town 

coulter-brown introduced linton
and then he answered yes her-
man that was our plane and i hope it
did a good job of exploding whats the
report about it 

  they say they must have scored a di-
rect hit on the gas-tank ammunition
bombs or whatever it was on the plane
blew everything to bits including pilot
and crew they dont think it possible
any of them escaped but nevertheless
theyre scouring the country just in case
anyone did parachute down but tell
me the news

  first herman weve got work to do
linton has a bunch of infra-red negatives
that must be developed and transmitted
to london right away i fancy well
have to work under the orders of the
legless legion until we get out of here
is there any underground into holland
now 

  jerry its so tight a thought couldnt
get through give me the negatives and
ill rush them through the developer
while im in the darkroom youd better
talk with london and tell them how
things stand so they can get moving
you know where everything is located
herman disappeared into a closet in
one corner-the darkroom-and coulter-
brown seated himself before a small ma-
chine at the table he adjusted a tiny
dial to a number threw a switch and
after a few seconds pause a voice spoke
so clear and vibrant that linton gasped
and looked around seventeen  
seven-eight-two replied coulter-
brown there was a pause then yes
seven-eight-two go on

  jcb was browns rejoinder then
the voice came back jerry what the
devil you doing in meppen thought
you were flying special service

ijets get out of this parachute
harness oot to roll em tight-
mate em as small as possible

  was jerry chuckled got hit by
an archie lieutenant linton and i
parachuted down and our plane was
completely destroyed by our time-bomb
i think were in the clear made it here
and herman is developing some infra-
red negatives as soon as theyre ready
well send them through and you see to
their getting to headquarters theyre
important for they show beyond doubt
that the enemy is concentrating a huge
force of mechanized troops in the salient
here at meppen and all the way to the
coast dont know how far south they
extend

  herman been able to pick up any-
thing new

  that i dont know he said every-
thing was closed between here and the
dutch border havent had a chance to
talk thngs over with him
  right get the pictures through as
soon as possible-better shoot a set
through to paris while youre at it and
well leave it to paris to get them to the
hague ill have news and orders for
you soon good luck 

for a moment after the london con-
versation was finished coulter-brown
sat as though in deep thought while lin-
ton stared speechless then brown set
the dial at another figure and a minute
later was exchanging identification num-
bers with the paris office he gave them
the news of their being shot down and of
their temporary escape and asked them
to stand ready to shoot the papers along
to the hague as soon as they were re-
layed to paris

  these pictures he told the agent in
paris will either set the dutch on their
toes so that germany will hesitate to in-
vade them or it will throw their weight
on the side of the allies either will be
something worth while well have them
through to you within an hour

  right well take care of them
watch your step jerry and let us know
if there is anything we can do to help
get you out of the country

  how the devil can you talk with lon-
don and paris without the germans pick-
ing up your wave-length and locating
this station how do you get the pow-
er where are the broadcasting aeri-
als demanded linton when brown had
finished his conversation

  coulter-brown explained all he thought
advisable after all linton was a mem-
ber of special service and that was a
top-hole recommendation but it was not
up to brown to tell the secrets of the
legless legion to outsiders this is a
development of the radio that has never
been placed in public service he ex-
plained it operates on a wave-length
so far removed from the shortest or long-
est known waves that no existing station
can pick it up its free from all types
of interference natural or man-made no
other station can block it and it re-
quires very little voltage for transmis-
sion this radio is one of the keys to the
success of the legion as a commercial
organization

  now that war is raging again theyve
turned themselves over to the services
of great britain-under cover of course
they will- heres herman lets see
what you got on your films

  remarkable these infra-red films
said herman how they can go

through fog rain and blackness and reg-
ister detail is a mystery to me but its
here look ill put this one in the
projector and thrsw it up so you can
study it clear as a bell it shows troops
on the march toward the dutch border
troops tanks artillery every branch of
the service look at the flash of the
anti-aircraft guns now if an expert can
pick out the mobile guns from the fixed
positions it may mean something we
could work out a path through them
where it would be safe for an airplane
to fly like going ihrough a mine-field
to anyone not versed in reading aerial
pictures the projec ted image would have
been meaningless but to coulter-brown
and linton it was like reading print and
they were more than pleased with the re-
sults they saw

  can you send that over the radio
asked linton

  herman smiled at the skepticism in his
voice yes we do even better than
send the photographs which could only
go in black and white outlines we send
direct from the negatives and it repro-
duces exactly at the receiving set with-
out loss of detaillets start just

give me your identification-cards and
ill send them through first in case ftie
war office is hard to convince of the
authenticity of the pictures then well
shoot along the negatives

  herman placed the flyers documents
in a metal frame and inserted them in a
small machine with the front facing a
lens when he threw a switch a small
wheel behind the lens began to turn and
there was a slight hum hardly notice-
able two minutes were required to send
the identification

herman made an adjustment to the
machine explaining that they used
a different light and lens for transmitting
negatives one after another they fed
the negatives into the machine when
they were done herman switched the
machine to voice

  how did they come through he in-
quired

  clear as a bell that is the first
ones the others arent developed yet
stand by-im sending orders for coul-
ter-brown and linton placing the two
of them under the direct orders of ad-
miral yardsley thats the only way we
could work it so they could operate free-
ly through the legion -stand by
the orders that came through were re-
productions typed and signed by an offi-


cial of the special service whose signa-
ture both of them knew it ordered them
to detached service under admiral yards-
ley of the naval intelligence until fur-
ther notice with this was a brief mes-
sage from yardsley wishing them good
luck and adding youll receive orders
if necessary from number one

  whos number one inquired lin-
ton when he read the message

  that replied coulter-brown is
something ill never tell you such in-
formation must come from the man him-
self now lets shoot a set of these pic-
tures to paris then we can go to sleep
with the knowledge that weve done a
good nights work for the empire
now said herman after they had
finished with paris lets talk about our-
selves for a while youll want to get
back to england and active service as
soon as possible i presume

  thats right they both exclaimed
as soon as we possibly can got any
ideas

  thats hard to say at the moment
you jerry with your knowledge of the
country around here and your ability to
handle the german language might be
able to make it through to holland but

youd be not much better off there-
youd be interned the dutch are do-
ing their best to remain neutral bel-
gium would be better but its harder to
get there from here this part of ger-
many is packed with soldiers but worse
is the secret police-theyre devils 

  is it safe for us to lie up here-that
is wont it endanger christine and you 
safe enough yes weve had this
place for twelve years and are estab-
lished as pure-blooded aryans but no
one is safe from suspicion nowadays no
one knows what his neighbor is doing
and anything suspicious is sure to be re-
ported can you handle one of these
german planes 

  ill handle any plane if i can get five
minutes to study the layout of the in-
struments think there is a chance to
get away in one of them 

  it might be done its worth while
looking into as air-raid warden i pa-
trol one of the fields here at the edge of
town on my tour of duty from four
in the afternoon to twelve midnight you
could slip out and conceal yourselves in
one of the planes and then about an hour
before daylight you could make a dash
for it if you made it they would never


if they ever dis-
covered this cel-
lar- wed so
up in it hlae of
glory said chris-
tine -however-

illustrated by grattan condon
the blue book magazine

know who got away in the plane its
a chance but the only one i see for the
moment that offers even a possibility
it would be tough starting off with a
cold motor once in the air and the mo-
tor warmed it would be better than an
even break -what say linton would
you take a chance 

  would i i joined the special serv-
ice squadron because i was willing to
take chances im with you all the way
get me in the rear seat with a machine-
gun and ill keep our tail clear

 good -all right herman you
watch for the chance locate the fast-
est two-seater possible and be sure
theres enough room in front for a take-
off check the oil and petrol and ammu-
nition for the guns well hedgehop out
of here so fast theyll never be able to
lay a sight on us one hour later well
be ducking british archies

  that can be taken care of said her-
man once you get in the air it dial
london and tell them you are on the way
in a german plane so theyll be looking
for you better sit down on the cliffs
at dover

  linton laughed good-naturedly you
two talk as though you were already in
the plane and on your way dont for-
get therell be a few dozen german sol-
diers watching those planes

  thatll be our best bet they feel se-
cure in numbers anyway whod ever ex-
pect anyone to be crazy enough to steal
a plane from under their very noses
they turned in for the night coulter-
brown and linton in the secret base-
ment where there were several bunks
made up against the wall and herman
upstairs where in case of an emergency
he would be at home in bed as any hon-
est burgher should be

in the seclusion of the sub-basement
they never knew when day came or the
darkness of another blacked-out night
settled down christine brought their
food and stayed as long as she dared to
chat you must be careful jerry she
said one day the people here are not
the germans you knew when you were
visiting these parts somethings gone
wrong with them theyre convinced
that their very existence depends on the
annihilation of the english if they were
to catch you theyd tear you apart
what about yourself christine
youve lived here for years over this
mine what would happen if they ever
discovered this cellar

  thats all takein care of wed go
up in a blaze of glory that would startle
germany theres enough high-explosive
under this cellar to wreck the entire
city we were just about to retire and
get away from it all when this new war
came along now of course we must see
it through were established here and
no one could take our place however
i think were safe enough here

day after day ihey remained in the
basement keeping in touch with
outside things via the radio they knew
that the pictures they had made on their
last flight had been sent to holland and
had been acted upon with promptitude
the dutch had canceled all army leaves
and called another class of reserves to re-
inforce the soldiers already posted in the
border defenses others were in readi-
ness to blow the strategic dikes to flood
the country ahead of any invading horde
warned holland was ready to fight for
her independence

  apparently this had had its effect on
the germans for herman reported that
while huge quantities of war material
were still being piled up along the bor-
der no new troops were arriving and
many of those already there were be-
ing shunted to the north where word had
it they were digging in along the coast-
line of the baltic sea but the cordon
of troops along the border was still con-
sidered impassable

  then one night herman gave them the
word that the time had come to make
the attempt to escape shortly before
midnight they made their way without
trouble to the air-field where reserve
planes were stored herman met them
and slipped them past the guards to
where a dozen planes were standing in
the open with motors and propellers pro-
tected from the weather by canvas

  here she is said herman in a whis-
per as he led them to a sleek powerful
reconnaissance plane that carried six
machine-guns as armament ive been
working all night filling her with petrol
he whispered again shes equipped
with aerial camera and will make a nice
prize in herself good luck as soon as
i get home ill pass the word along to
london that they can expect you

  after a silent handshake they crawled
into the cockpit like mice they cow-
ered in the darkness then while linton
watched for the guards coulter-brown
took the opportunity to use his tiny
flashlight to study the instrument boad
within the enemys line

and locate the controls finally he whis-
pered that he was all set and all they
had to do now was to wait

 the weather had moderated a bit and
in their heavy flying-suits they were not
uncomfortable but it was a relief when
their watches showed another hour would
bring daylight linton slipped out re-
moved the canvas cover from the motor

 carefully brown adjusted the controls
for petrol oil and ignition he reached
out and grasped lintons hand then
threw the starter-switches there came
a dull slow grind as the starters motor
overcame the inertia of the cold motors
and the thickened oil they held their
breath now was tie moment that de-
cided everything for them

 with a sudden roar the motors caught
and burst into a full-throated blast for
a moment as long as he dared coulter-
brown held fast giving the motors a
chance to loosen the oil if there were
any sound of alarm they could not hear
it above the noise of the motors then
he eased the throttles back watching the
instruments closely for synchronization
the ship moved forward slowly at first
heavy then as the petrol was fed to the
motors it leaped ahead like a thing alive
and they were on the field

  lights sprang into dazzling life behind
them but controls that had been harsh
and heavy became feather-light as the
lift was transferred from the wheels to
the wings coulter-brown felt the ship
off the ground and held her level for a
bare matter of seconds then zoomed in-
to the darkness of the heavens linton
looking back and down could see stars
twinkling on the air-field-and knew
them to be flashes from rifles and ma-
chine-guns

browns intenticn had been to hedge-
hop the few miles to the holland
border then climb but when he felt the
surging power of the ships two powerful
motors and knew they were functionally
perfect he changed his mind like a
giant bat they bored into the darkness
higher and higher then lights sprang
at them from below and ahead criss-
crossing wavering searching making
strange patterns in the pre-dawn dark-
ness brown turned and climbed away
from the lights and the anti-aircraft guns
he knew were there in wide spirals he
climbed three thousand meters five six
-they were breathing heavily for want
of oxygen when brown headed on a com-
passcourse for the cliffs of dover

  up where they were flying it was grow-
ing light but the earth was shrouded in
a deep purple haze linton checked his
watch and announced they were well
over holland-and they breathed eas-
ier then through the graying light
they saw the white-capped waves of the
channel below them and a minute later
the chalk cliffs of england loomed ahead
brown picked up his bearings from land-
marks and shifted his course a bit

now safety depended on whether
herman had got a message through
it was a chance they had to take brown
throttled the motors and glided down
there were no signs of activity on the
airdrome below linton patted him on
the shoulder and pointed upward he
stole a look and a smile spread over his
face as he saw a dozen or more hawker
hurricanes scattered out above them in
attack formation he dragged the small
field twice to get the feel of the settling
ship and with a prayer on his lips set
the wheels on the ground a fitting cli-
max to the adventure was forming in his
mind and it called for fast work

  officers and men came up as they
rolled to a stop suspicious at first then
at sight of their british uniforms they
burst into cheers

  get this plane under wraps said
coulter-brown as soon as he could make
himself heard get it out of sight and
set the archies to beating hell out of the
clouds

  the officer in charge looked as though
hef thought he was crazy so brown ex-
plained  keep the plane out of sight
stage a fake air-battle with all the trim-
mings and then report that the german
raider was shot down and fell into the
sea later report part of it washed
ashore and give the numbers of this
plane the germans will get the report
of course and theyll always be in doubt
as to just what really did happen
theyll think that whoever did steal the
plane was shot down and if it was brit-
ish spies escaping why it was a good
joke on them to be brought down by
their own forces within sight of safety

  and that was the cause of one of the
terrific air-battles reported along the
coast later the plane was flown at
night to another field where it was in-
spected and studied by raf engineers
and ten days afterward coulter-brown
and lieutenant linton were presented
to the king who pinned a much-coveted
decoration on their service tunics
the moky

            the able author of the amazing dr c litter house
            sets forth the adventures of an american airplane
            hostess and an auto-race driver in war-time europe

 as far as i knew i was the last
 american left in london and
 f- it gave me a solitary castaway
 a  feeling as i walked down the
 hotel foyer

   the doorman looked at me because
 he had orders to see that nobody went
 into the street without his gas-mask

   oky ive got it i growled and
 showed him the dented cardboard box

   thank you sir he said politely

   i dived between heavy drapes pushed
 on a shrouded glass door and stepped into
 londons blackout a few cars crept
 along piccadilly and a few pedestrians
 blundered along the sidewalk except
 for the down-thrown blurs of masked
 auto-lamps there were no lights of any
 sort anywhere

   i intended to take in a news-reel on
 the chance of seeing bits of film from the
 i usa which was about the only way i
 could satisfy my homesickness  turned
 up the collar of my top-coat slung the
 gas-mask over my shoulder by its loop
 of string and headed for piccadilly cir-
 cus where they have the local equivalent
 of a trans-lux

   i kept away from the shopfronts be-
 cause they were cluttered with sandbags
 over which it is easy to trip i dodged a
 man with a luminous button pinned to
 his hat then bumped into something fat
 and hard and once again found myself

saying pardon me to a sandbagged
fire-alarm post	m

  that annoyed me and i was not in a
good temper anyway id had more than
enough of blackouts and all that went
with them and on top of a string of
bad breaks i knew that now i couldnt
get back in time to drive at indianapolis

  in the absolute darkness-and you
need to be there to realize just how dark
a blackout is-i jolted down a curb fum-
bled across a side street and stubbed my
toes against another curb i was getting
straightened out when the air-raid sirens
went off

  they made a massed wailing noise
very scary in the night cars with white-
tipped fenders wheeled toward the side-
walk stopped and emptied all at once
people came from nowhere out of the
dark hit me and were gone running for
shelter i kept going because i wanted
to watch a news-reel not waste time in
somebodys cellar the place was hardly
a block ahead and it was down a base-
ment anyway i heard air-raid wardens
calling directions and one grabbed as i
passed him

  theres a shelter here sir he was
just a shadow under a steel helmet
plenty of room sir

  nuts  i said and went on

  i say he called and he was very
indignant i say tltiere

 a novelette by

barre lyndon

  with the sirens moaning i made an-
other twenty yards then somebody else
caught at my arm

  down here please  a big cop had
stopped me near sandbagged steps lead-
ing to a cellar under a shopfront

  im going to that news-theater i
told him

  youre going down below he told
me

 they cant make you they cant
force you to carry a gas-mask even and
you dont have to take shelter in an air-
raid if you dont want to

  now listen- i began

  if you please sir suggested a very
cultured voice and a special constable
took my other arm

  im an american i snarled you
cant make me go down there

  push himl said the cop

  they pushed and i went slithering
down the steps into a musty gas-blanket
this way sir  said another plummy
voice and i was shoved into a cellar
which was lit by a screened hurricane-
lamp there were a dozen people sit-
ting on benches along the wtalls all look-
ing at me

  you remain here until we get the all-
clear sir said the warden on the en-
trance

 you go jump in the lake and i
started for the steps just as the gas-

blanket opened up and the cop came
through because of the low ceiling he
looked bigger than normal as he put a
hand against my chest and pushed

  sit down he said gently and backed
me across the cellar sit down 

  i felt the edge of a bench behind my
knees and sat down its never wise to
argue with a cop and this one must have
weighed two hundred twenty pounds i
scale only a hundred and forty stripped
auto-racing tends to thin you down

  now youre here stay here said the
cop and keep quiet 

  he nodded at me hitched his belt and
went out then someone spoke at my
side

  its no good theyve got you broth-
er

  it was a girls voice and if i hadnt
guessed it from her tone i would have
known that only an american girl could
have looked so smart in that dingy pic-
cadilly basement she smiled while i
stared at her

well what dyou know about this 
i tipped my hat feeling suddenly cheered
im tommy vandenburg new york
lucy martin she introduced herself
and i live out in queens long island
we shook hands

  she wore a persian lamb coat and a
neat little hat with a new kind of snood
and she had gray eyes wifh long lashes


  youre not doing this all on your own
  are you i asked

 quite on my own she said and i
 looked at her again

  this was someth ing i could appreciate
  youve heard about those boys who work
  their way through college well im one

sit down he said gently

  when youre three thousand miles or
so from home it gives you a very warm
and friendly feeling to meet someone who
speaks your own language she seemed
just as pleased as i was

  i thought all american girls had gone
home long ago i said

  well ive been collecting baggage
that other americans left behind she
answered and went on ive been round-
ing it up in france and switzerland and
belgium and now imlocatingsomehere
for a travel agency

  no just for myself she said

  i didnt get it at first the sirens
stopped as we talked on and nobody paid
any attention to us they were all listen-
ing for the guns its generally all right
in an air raid until you hear the guns

  apparently she had landed on vacation
just as the war started other americans
had shed baggage in all directions stam-
peding for steamship berths but she had
got the idea of assembling their aban-
doned baggage and following them home
with it charging five dollars and up per
piece delivered in new york

  when im through she told me ill
have about a thousand pieces of baggage
to take back

of them i did it by working around gar-
ages but i never graduated i slid into
auto-racing instead it took five years
on the fairgrounds and three rides at
indianapolis before my rebuilt miller
lead the rest home over the bricks then
i got the idea of coming to europe and
driving in the worlds fastest five-hun-
dred-mile race at brooklands

practice on that tough track did things
to the old miller the motor went to
pieces finally and completely along the
railway straight and anyway the war
cancelled the event but i cabled home
for a new engine and looked for another
race being in europe i wanted to drive
somewhere war or no war

the freighter with my new motor hit
a german mine and sunk i told ltfcy
martin but now ive bought the power
unit out of a miller owned by a man over
here its been hung up on the railroad
coming down from scotland when it ar-
rives im off to italy for a race called
the circuito dalessandria thats due
in ten days from now and then im go-
ing home via genoa

  thats the way i shall go she said

  after shed collected the baggage in
london she had to pick up four hundred
pieces that she had assembled in calais
and she had that much more stored in a
garage on the rue monsigny paris i
tried to imagine what a thousand pieces
of baggage would look like it seemed to
me that when she had it all together
transportation was going to be quite a
problem

  itll be more than just a problem-
and she had a funny little smile-be-
cause ive already begun to wonder what
i shall do for money but dont offer to
help me please then she went on
quietly im going through with this en-
tirely by myself

  she meant that she wasnt just talk-
ing

  im going to get that baggage over
home she added firmly if i have to
build a raft and punt it across
  better wait she said youll only
quarrel with that cop  

  she looked at me as we talked and she
didnt see so much im too lean to be
handsome and seven or eight years of
beating fast trouble does things to your
face you get tight around the jaw so
your chin squares up and wind and dust
gie your skin a browned-off look

  inside another ten minutes sirens
sounded the all clear and the cellar
emptied maybe it had been a false
alarm maybe just practice you couldnt
teli

  things were coming to life again as
we went toward piccadilly circus traf-
fic lights were masked to tiny colored
crosses busses were lumbering around
the misty circus like black hulks and
little groups were still climbing up from
basement shelters

  dodging things didnt give much chance
for conversation as we went along to
leicester square where the entrances to
the movie houses were dark and chill as
morgues the gardens had been cut up
for shelter trenches and you could just
see the statue of shakespeare in the
center the cafe that i wanted was at the
far side and we fumbled through heavy
drapes beyond the doorway it was a
bright spot once you got inside all pol-
ished woodwork and chromium and
about the nearest thing london has to a
broadway cafeteria  

  we ate waffles and drank coffee and
she had an air of taking time out from
whatever troubles were worrying her
when she laughed i noticed that her long

 lashes shut themselves and that made
 you watch for her eyes to come peeping
 through again

   presently she told me that the friend
 who had been with her had gone home
 and this girl had been sending her au-
 thorizations to collect the baggage

   i wanted to see something of europe
 in spite of the war she added that
 shed seen more than enough by that
 time and she wasnt very pleased with
 london the baggage here is scattered
 around in about twenty hotels she told
 me i want to find some way of assem-
 bling it without spending a cent more
 than im obliged you see ive got just
 about two hundred dollars and i must
 stretch it as far as i can i think it will
 get me to about halfway between here
 and paris 

   and then what 

   then i dont know what she ad-
 mitted

  how about sending home for more
 money i asked

   theres a lot of money in new york
 but none of it belongs to me she said
 and ive had all that my friend can send

me

                                      

  good for you i said

  i noticed that she had a tiny bridge to
her nose and that her face was shaped
not just rounded she had style and ef-
fectiveness and there was something
downright nice about her-something
which made her the sort of girl youd
always be pleased to ee i felt that id
like to talk somewhere different from that
chilly cellar

  i know a place near here where they
make good waffles and real coffee i said
is that an idea

  it is if youll allow me to buy my
own waffles and coffee she agreed
then lets go i started to get up

    then someone spove at my side
    its no good theyve got you
    brother it was a girls volee
  she realized that sooner or later and
probably somewhere short of paris she
would find herself sitting beside a great
pile of baggage broke and stranded
what she would do then she didnt know
how she could possibly make out she
didnt know but-

  ive started this and im going to fin-
ish it-by myself  she said

  why particularly by yourself i
asked

  because if i dont ill be licked and
im just not going to be licked thats
all she answered

  that was a good-enough reason and it
was one which anyone could understand

  it seemed that she hadnt even a return
steamship ticket she had cashed that in
for expense money and it had provided
most of her two hundred dollars i
watched her sipping coffee and it oc-
cured to me to ask what she did when
she wasnt on vacation

 a ctually i quit my job to take
this holiday but they said i could
go back she told me im an air-line
hostess

  that accounted for why she was so
small and dainty and smart and if they
were all like her it accounted for why
air hostesses are so popular

  if youre in transportation i could
wish it were railroads i said then
maybe you could tell me how to get some
quicker action over the motor theyve
lost for me here

  thats easy  and she laughed go
after the biggest man in the outfit and
tell him hes got a lousy railroad thatll
start something 

  we talked a little more then she said
she had things to do i walked with her
to the underground station just by lei-
cester square

  would you mind if i call you tomor-
row to see how youre coming along
i asked after she had mentioned the
name of her hotel

  im afraid i shall be busy she an-
swered and offered her hand but its
been nice meeting you good-by mr
vandenburg

  i suppose they teach air hostesses how
to stall men off but i hadnt meant it that
way maybe she realized it because she
smiled as i tipped my hat

  but if you get an idea of how i can
round up all my london baggage for
about five cents call me early  she said

  i thought a lot about lucy martin and
her thousand pieces of baggage and i

didnt see any way she could make out
if she was short of money the more
i thought about her the more i wanted
to see her again but i made up my mind
that i wouldnt offer help and i knew she
wouldnt ask it she wanted to plow her
own furrow in her own way and it
wasnt for me or aryone else to interfere

  i had some small troubles of my own
and not the least of these was a question
of time i had the car in a little garage
off jermyn street which is by piccadilly
you couldnt hire racing mechanics in
england any more they were all in avia-
tion factories id been straightening
things out by myself and all i now had
to do when i got the motor was drop it
in the chassis and rig things the way i
wanted them but that was going to
take a couple of days at least

  then id got to get to italy which was
going to take two more days and maybe
three that didnt leave much time for
practice on a road circuit id never seen

  the general opini on was that this ales-
sandria event might be the last race held
in europe until the war was over because
the italians expected to step into the
struggle any time it meant all the
cracks who could get there would be out
for one last fling taking what might de
their final chance to settle a lot of old
rivalries and pay off a few grudges

  looked at by and large it was likely
to be exciting and i didnt want to miss
it and being the only american run-
ning i did want to make a fair show

i went after my engine again next
morning down to the freight depot of
the london and scottish railway by
dingy kings cross the man in charge
had his routine answer all ready every-
thing possible was being done

  youve said that four times in a row
but nothings happened  i said and re-
membered lucys advice whos the
biggest man on this railroad

  sir philip trenton is the general man-
ager he said smoothly

  is he here now i asked

  he attends transport conferences at
whitehall every morning he told me
and sir philip invariably lunches at the
carlton on the way down here hell be
in at about three oclock

  then ill be back i said

  he sees no one without an appoint-
ment he told me

  ill still be back i said

  i couldnt afford to waste any more
time id got to have action and the

m
im jxist not going to bo liekod thats all she answered

way to get it was to come back at three
oclock raise hell and bust in on sir
philip

  there was nothing more i could do un-
til the afternoon i started to walk back
to piccadilly and the scenery wasnt
pleasant i went through streets where
sandbags were stacked at every cellar en-
trhce and where every window was
guarded against blasts by criss-crosses of
gummed paper the cops were all wear-
ing steel helmets there were gas-de-
tector stations and first-aid posts every
open space had been dug for trenches and
each corner bore air-raid shelter direc-
tion-signs

  i was thinking about lucy martin
wondering how she was coming along
about assembling the london baggage
to collect it by taxi would cost like the
dickens and with gasoline around sixty
cents a gallon hiring a truck would be
expensive

  then i had a bright idea

  i had struck a street market-where
the local folk buy from barrows every-
thing between vegetables and silk stock-
ings with stocks depleted by the war
trade looked pretty bad and i saw one
tough little gray-haired cockney sitting
on his barrow looking altogether fed up
i had an idea

  do you ever hire yourself out i
asked him

  guvnor- he pushed his cap to the
back of his head as he spat in the gutter
guvnor ill shove this blasted barrow
all over london for two bob an hour and
be glad to earn the money

  two bob meant two shillings that
was near enough to fifty cents he said
the same figure went for anybody else on
the street and i saw that you could get
a lot of baggage on barrows like his
four of them could probably collect all
lucys baggage for somewhere around
eight dollars

  i made for the nearest telephone and
called her up still working the thing out
she came on the wire and i explained

  mr vandenburg im glad i met
you she was tickled to death thatll
save me a lot of money 

  right then i had another idea

  i told her what had happened at the
freight depot it seemed to me that if
i lunched at the carlton i could just
step over to sir philips table and tell him
what his railroad was doing to me it
would be a lot easier than trying to bust
in at his office

  i believe the carlton is a pretty swell
place i said and if i had a little deco-
rative background it might be useful so
would you care to lunch with me there
and supply the background 

  of course if you think it will help
you she said but while i can still
afford to eat ill buy my own lunch 
okay i said ill make a date for
four of these men and well pick them up
afterward

to a girl from queens this certainly
 is something said lucy quietly
thank you for bringing me

we were in the carlton and the place
had shaken me a bit it was ritzy ex-

the cockneys knew all the
short-cuts and the trip was
fun    she was very
pleased with herself

illustrated by
charles chickering

elusive all pastel tones and flecks of gold
with a scattering of staff officers naval
men and important-looking civilians

  the carlton had something all its own
the ceiling was as high as the roof of a
church which gave everything a sort of
hallowed air you just couldnt laugh off
that smooth elite atmosphere it cer-
tainly impressed me but lucy might
have been born to it she was bright and
smiling and she looked like a million dol-
lars under a different hat with a new kind
of snood

  perhaps your idea isnt quite so hot
now she suggested and i knew shed
guessed the way i felt

  it would be next to impossible to bust
in at sir philips table as id expected
as the english say that sort of thing
simply isnt done-not at the carlton

  if you only want a chance to speak to
him lucy said slowly perhaps i could
introduce you

  do you know him i asked sur-
prised

  no she said and he doesnt know
me but you need your motor quickly
so ill see what i can do

she said nothing more until the waiter
brought her potted shrimps and my grape-
fruit then she asked him casually has
sir philip trenton come in yet

  there he is now madam the waiter
replied with lord arlington

  the head waiter was bowing them in
sir philip was tall stiff-necked and beak-
nosed and he wore starched linen lord
arlington had a red face and white hair
and he was short and tubby they went
to a reserved table and then i saw lucy
smiling in the way a girl does when she
has thought of something daring

  lets go halves on a bottle of cham-
pagne she said then you leave this
to me 

  i didnt know what she had in mind
but with a girl like her it was bound to
be something pretty good soon there
were filled glasses on the table and a bot-
tle in an ice-bucket she had started on
smoked trout when i saw her glance
toward sir philip she caught his eye
then bent her head in a gracious little
gesture as if she recognized him

  he clutched his table napkin came
half to his feet and bowed lucy nodded
to him again then spoke coolly to me

  give me a little more champagne will
you mr vandenburg
  i could see sir philip glancing at her
now and again as if he was trying to rec-
ollect who she was she ignored him
until presently she picked up her glass
it was halfway to her lips when apparent-
ly she just happened to catch sir philips
gaze again with a tiny little movement
she raised her glass to him and hurriedly
he reached for his own smiled and drank
with her

t think were halfway to that intro-
 duction she said but if hes never
been to new york im going to look fool-
ish so stand by to help me out and be
smart when it comes to names

  she glanced at sir philip once again
he had his eye on her and smiled she
got up come on   she whispered to me
and sir philip rose as she went across to
the other table with me close behind

  im sure you havent the slightest rec-
ollection of me sir philip she said
but i think youll remember that dinner
in new york 

  of course of course he exclaimed
and with a girl like lucy anybody would
have remembered that dinner in new
york cwhat are you doing in london 
i hope to leave for home in a day or
two she said may i introduce mr
vandenburg 

  i remembered what she had said about
helping with names

  miss martin told me who you were
sir philip i said

  he nodded to me picking up her name
neatly miss martin may i present
lord arlington

  arlington bowed  she bowed  then the
old buffer bowed to me

  i think i chiefly remember the speech
you made lucy said conversationally

  oh at the plaa sir philip ex-
claimed  apparently that placed her for
him i was in form that night then
he asked wont you join us for cof-
fee a waiter had already started to
bring chairs this really is a most de-
lightful meeting miss martin he said
and arlington knows new york too
he did but it was the new york of a
long time ago he wanted to know if
ziegfeld still ran his follies i gathered
that a follies girl had been a brief but
very bright spot in his life and she had
left him with a liking for anything amer-
ican he couldnt take his eyes off lucy

  everything was grand right from the
start lord arlington insisted on our
having liqueurs and lucy said shed
have a drambuie  had a feeling that

 was a blind bet on her part sir philip
 talked about the speech she hadnt heard
 him make and arlington kept switching
 back to the follies girl each in his
 own way seemed to have had the time
 of his life in new york and we talked
 until sir philip asked again what kept
 lucy in london

   hundreds of things she said and
 mr vandenburgs waiting for something
 lost on a railroad 

   whatrailroadlord arli ngton asked
 its the london and scottish i said
 your line  arlington told sir philip
 and chuckled to me as my new york
 acquaintance would have said his rail-
 way is utterly bum what have they
 lost for you-luggage

   i mentioned what it was

   troop movements and so on have
 rather disorganized us sir philip said
 stiffly a racing-car engine from scot-
 land you said mr vandenburg ill
 have it looked into

   that was good enough if nothing
 happened i could call him up now

 she had been grand and i told her so
 while the taxi took us to the street
 market

   ive never done anything like that
 before she said but what had we to
 lose 

   all i hoped was that my idea about the
 barrows would work out because i owed
 her something now the cockneys knew
 all the short-cuts and the trip was fun
 it took a long time to work through her
 list of hotels and the blackout was al-
 most on when we made the final trip the
  four barrows piled high with the last of
 the baggage heading for the little hotel
 where lucy was staying

   she was very pleased with herself
 swinging her gas-mask jauntily the
 men carried the baggage into a store-
 room and she paid them off then we
 were standing on the sidewalk in the
 dusk and here it seemed we parted

    if i can hire a truck i shall leave to-
 night she said thanks to the money
 youve helped me to save i now have
 just about enough to reach paris

   when i asked how she would get from
 there to genoa she hadnt the slightest
 idea she realized that she was going
 to be stranded in paris with no money
 and with enough accumulated baggage to
 frighten a company of redcaps but it
 didnt seem to faze her she said it was
 something shed worry about when she
 got there

ill
the blue book magazine

  good-by she said and i had a feel-
ing that she didnt much like saying it

  ill be in genoa the day after the
race waiting for a boat i said

  ill probably see you there she told
me if i can make it

  youll make it i said but i didnt
see how she could and something in my
tone must have told her that her chin
came up

  you dont think i can do you she
said well ill show you good-by
she turned to wave as she went up the
steps i tipped my hat again

  good luck i called ill be root-
ing for you  

  that evening i got my first halfway
decent break sir philip must have
chased his people around because a horse-
van turned up bringing the missing mo-
tor in a big crate i called lucy to tell
her the good news but she had already
checked out and was on her way

 the railroad van dumped the power
unit in the little garage where i kept the
car and i opened up the crate inside
was a fat envelope full of data and in-
formation and with this was a letter from
the man who had owned the engine

  he was a young scot named kinnaird
and hed raced a lot in europe like
pretty well all these wealthy british ama-
teur racing men he had put on uniform
and his letter was written from the depot
of the seaforth highlanders which ap-
parently was his regiment he wished
me luck then went on 

    i imported this miller two years ago
  and the engine comes to you tuned for
  attempts which  had intended to make
  on international records at brooklands

  i attach full details of all work done to-
  gether with test data youll also find
  some notes which i made when i raced
  at alessandria last summer and came
  home fifth its the hell of a course
  pietro gazzini who has a garage in the
  town will look after you and staff your
  pit if you mention my name he is a
  good man

    the entire mess of the seaforth high-
  landers will drink to your success on the
  evening before the race and if by any
  chance you should win we shall stage the
  whale of a party to celebrate it we
  feel that youll be riding for us as well
  as for old glory    good luck

  the tone of his letter made me feel
fine i sent a long cable to pietro gazzi-
ni right away then put on a boiler suit
and started work

  the test data showed that the motor
itself needed no tuning but id run my
own miller unit with twin superchargers
these were okay from the wreck and i
wanted to fit them also i used an ex-
haust cooling system and an extractor to
get the gasses away quickly these
things would give the engine more punch
and fitting them meant a lot of work

  the garage lent a couple of mechanics
but they were not very experienced and
i couldnt leave them alone on the job i
worked a straight twenty-four hours
caught four hours sleep and then went
back

  just sixty hours after id received the
motor we had the car on a truck and one
of the men was driving me down to dov-
er i shipped the car across the chan-
nel picked up another truck at calais
and headed for paris figuring to look in
at the rue monsigny in the hope of see-
ing something of lucy

the car was just about as good as i
could hope to get it leaving out ad-
justments for atmosphere and fuel which
i could make only on the circuit ac-
cording to kinnaird s -figures plus what
i doped out from my own additional
work the miller should be able to toua
something around  mph which is
pretty fast i knew that i should be up
against models capable of peaking at
close to two hundred but i was saved by
the fact that the alessandria course
didnt permit such speeds to be used

  just the same the italians would have
the edge on me in lots of ways they
were experienced road-racing men and
i wasnt on the other hand i was used
to riding close and stealing inches and
not getting scared when youre practically
locking wheels on a turn-and maybe
that might prove useful

  altogether i was looking forward to
it still more i was looking forward to
the chance of seeinglucy in paris it
was late at night when i got in checking
at a hotel near the place de lopera

  i locked the truck away in a garage
ate in a hurry then went to find the rue
monsigny id never been in paris be-
fore but it was much like london with
the same blackout and the same sand-
bags rue monsigny was not far away
and i located the only garage in it the
doors were closed but there was a
wicket gate on the latch and i went in

  i saw a colossal pile of baggage stacked
against the back wall and bags with lon-
don labels were in the foreground at

the smoky road

one side was an old sedan jacked up for
transmission repairs with a roof-light
burning i expected to find someone
whod tell me where lucy might be but
she herself was inside the car startled un-
til she recognized me

  she looked tired and i saw two blan-
kets opened on the rear seat in a cor-
ner was a bottle of milk and a bag of
rolls she was pleased to see me-at
first

  shed got the london baggage across
at a cut rate on a cargo-boat shed had
a lot of trouble with the customs in cal-
ais then shed hired transport and
everything was now assembled in this
garage

  youre not sleeping here are you
i asked

  why not she said

  are you so broke

  i am so broke she said

  her tone became chilly then she
didnt like my seeing that all she had
was cold milk and dry bread for supper
and the rear end of this broken-down old
renault sedan for a bedroom i didnt
like seeing it either

  have you done anything about get-
ting down to genoa i asked im go-
ingvia modane in the morning

  ill follow that route its the quickest
way to genoa she said but she had no
idea when she would start

  paris it seemed was a tough city
shed been there two days with her thou-
sand steamer-trunks and suitcases bags
and hat-boxes and what have you and
had been completely unsuccessful in get-
ting any farther

i couldnt see how shed even start
to raise the funds she needed and
i said so but she didnt want to talk
about it she just wanted to be left alone
to fight the thing out for herself she
indicated that

  im very tired and i havent been
getting much sleep she said so would
you mind if i put the bolt on that door
and say good night 

  i did the only thing and she followed
me to the wicket gate

  good night i made it cheerful as
i stepped outside if you get away in
time alessandrias on the road to genoa
could you stop off and see the race

  i will if i can she said id like
to watch you do your stuff her tone
was much warmer as she went on
thanks for the visit and keep rooting
for me wont you 
 yourt not sleeping in this old
 sedan arc you i asked

  she shut the wicket and the sound of
the bolt was lonely in that empty street

  she was going to sleep in that garage
it looked as though shed been doing it
since shed got to paris and maybe she
wasnt eating much between times she
was broke but she wasnt complaining
she was just taking it and keeping her
chin up

  i knew she hadnt a chance in ten thou-
sand of raising the money to go on shed
need four or five trucks to get that pile
of baggage away and that would cost
something like five hundred dollars how
could she scare up that much money
when no one knew her and her french
was probably lousy anyway

  id told myself that i wouldnt inter-
fere but i couldnt just go ahead and
leave her like this anything could hap-
pen to her in war-time paris if i of-
fered help shed turn it down i knew
so i decided to do what anybody else
would have done give her a hand over
this rough patch and do it without her
knowing

  id thought about the possibility on
and off and id worked out how it could
be done people at home had given me
a wad of introductions and one was to
a man named emile pepin on the rue
pigalle he contracted to transport autos
from race to race and would have been
useful if id wanted to drive much in
europe as id had some idea of doing

  it seemed to me that he might trans-
port baggage and a taxi took me up to
the rue pigalle a dark and narrow little
street pepin was a short man with a

leg crippled in a crack-up and bent shoul-
ders and the kind of gray eyes that never
flinch and which tell you that here is
clean honesty he spoke very good eng-
lish and he knew my name from that
win at indianapolis

  we talked a bit then i told him about
lucy and the transportation she needfed
he said that he could provide trucks and
the men i told him to see her in the
morning tender for the job and accept
her signature to pay from new york he
was to argue and above all make it real
and not let her guess anyone was behind
it

  i gave him five hundred bucks in trav-
elers checks so that hed be covered if
anything went wrong then i went back
to my hotel feeling like the worlds worst
low-life

  i knew that id done the common-sense
thing but i also knew i was cheating her
i felt somehow or other as if id lost
something

  shed never know what had happened
and pepin would mail me my five hun-
dred bucks after shed paid up so every-
thing would work out to the same in the
end yet i didnt feel happy

  presently i discovered that apart from
anything else chipping in had made a dif-
ference to my finances i could see my-
self through the race but i had no re-
turn-passage ticket

  but it was useless to worry about that
all id got to think about was getting on
the course in time for some practice

  i didnt sleep too well and i pulled out
with the truck at dawn noon id got


as far south as dijon and the driver on
the truck helped me call the garage in the
rue monsigny i wanted to know how
things were working out about my ar-
rangement with pepin and guessed that
i could get a hint of it from lucy she
came on the wire

  im leaving right away  she told me
ive had the most beautiful stroke of
luck 

  thats grand i said and felt as
phony as a seven-dollar bill what hap-
pened and i made that sound as if i
didnt know

  ill tell you in alessandria she an-
swered ill be there inside forty-eight
hours and ill stay to see the race

  only she wasnt there inside forty-
eight hours by that time i was driving
around the course on a car borrowed from
gazzini and one lap was enough to tell
me that this circuito dalessandria was
going to be tough-very tough indeed

apparently when they decide to
 have a road-race in europe they
give the course a non-skid dressing but
thats about all they do you take the
telegraph-poles and curbs jutting trees
and houses corners bridges ditches and
everything else just as they happen to be

  there were no safety-zones beside the
road if you ent oif the course you
were bound to hit the side of a house or a
two-foot elm tree or tangle amongst some
telegraph poles which is what makes
road-racing the most exciting sport in the
world and about the most dangerous

  the one straight section-where kin-
naird said you could touch one hundred
and sixty-had been built up on an eight-
foot embankment if you lost control
there your car would hit nose down and
start somersaulting-which is spectacu-
lar for the onlookers but not so good for
the driver

  there were two wicked-looking iron
bridges to negotiate and the home stretch
had old street-car lines embedded in the
surface with a water-filled dike at one
side and balconied italian houses flush
against the road-edge at the other they
all had protruding doorsteps

  it was about five miles to a lap and
sixty laps made the race distance this
was about all any driver could stand and
it was unusual for more than about six
cars to finish out of the twenty permitted
to start

  there was a main stand and other lit-
tle stands placed where things were likely
to happen there was bunting every-

where and flags and every second flag
was the stars and stripes hung out be-
cause of me

  i hadnt realized that an american car
with an american driver was a very rare
thing over there about the last time one
had shown up he had walked off with the
french grand prix using a duesenberg
they wanted to encourage me but that
was only for the pleasure of seeing their
own men lick me

  we put the miller on the road for car-
buretion adjustments when the afternoon
practice session started i did quiet
three-lap spells then came back to the
pit where gazzini did the tuning and sent
me out again he was a good man-a
tiny man with delicate features and hands
like a womans maybe it was this which
gave him the right touch and inside an
hour the miller was strutting her stuff
but i didnt try anything showy

  italian drivers took their crimson autos
past me nearly every man lifting a hand
as he went challenging me to put my foot
down but i wouldnt have it i had to
get familiar with the course

  three german cars were in the event
and they had come specially from the
reich there was a mercedes and two
were auto-unions-vicious low-built
cruel-looking cars with rear engines the
drivers sitting away up front they were
beautifully streamlined with road-wheels
hidden under fairings and the noise they
made as they went by was a wicked
scream

i studied the corners and bends pick-
ing my best line through them fixing
my emergency braking points getting the
feel of the miller just before practice
ended i hit the fast stretch in an attempt
to find out what the wagon could do the
miller came into it with twin blowers
screaming-exhaust note reaching up and
getting lost in the wind that shrieked past
my ears feeling solid as water

  in those moments the car had the life
you get only with real speed while the
road became a streaky ribbon and the
low ground beside it was a streaming
blur i took the revolution counter needle
into the red and held it which meant that
i was doing a shade over  mph and
i still had power to spare

  that satisfied me if the miller could
stand up to the thrashing the race would
give her and if i could handle the car
right i should make a show i felt

  i spent the evening studying the turns
on foot there was to be practice for the


the blue book magazine

whole of the next day and that would be
all i should get the day after that the
course would be closed and officials
would check over the cars the next day
would bring the race

  i expected lucy to show up next day
but she didnt gazzini borrowed a fast
machine for me to use for part of that
long practice spell so that i could save
the miller i didnt put my own car on
the road until the final hour and the
moment i went out no less than five ital-
ians and two of the germans came after
me trying to work me into a scrap

  they were burning to know what id
got but i wouldnt show them i played
cagey going easy down the straights
but opening up for the corners hitting
them as fast as i dared going through
them with everything howling coming
away wide open-and then easing for the
straight again so that i didnt show fast
figures over any lap

  like that i got practice on the corners
without giving anything away

there was still no sign of lucy that
evening next morning gazzini sent
a man around the town inquiring for a
lady with a lot of baggage when he drew
a blank i got the idea of driving out to
the frontier and maybe meeting her on
the vay there was nothing more that
i could do and gazzini was able to han-
dle the official business about the car bet-
ter than i could

  he lent me a quick little fiat i did
some fast work along the autostrada to
turin and went still faster over the
military road out to the frontier station
below modane i made the distance in-
side three hours and id seen nothing of
any trucks which might have been lucys
when i parked the fiat by the frontier
post

  the place was sandbagged and there
were soldiers everywhere i saw great
cradles of barbed wire ready to sling
across the road and close it and the
ground on either hand was scarred by
trench systems with more wire

  there were blockhouses concrete tank-
traps and camouflage-all of it a remind-
er that the italians were standing by
ready for anything equally it was a
reminder that it is dangerous to monkey
around on any european frontier nowa-
days

  i waited about the post for a while
watching the customs men check traffic
that trickled through i spoke no italian
and could make no inquiries but finally

i got myself passed onto the kilometer of
road that crosses no mans land to the
french frontier i thought i could ask
them there whether lucy had passed
through their post id- learned enough
french in college for that

  the road was cut along the side of a
hill so that there was a cliff at one hand
and the ground fell away at the other it
was quiet along there and across the
falling ground i saw still more rusting
barbed wire great masses that twisted
endlessly away looking very ugly in the
sunshine

  around a curve in the road i saw the
actual frontier markers where you step
from italy into france then i saw
something else

  stacked up just inside italian territory
were one thousand-odd pieces of ameri-
can baggage and lucy was with them
sitting on a trunk and eating an apple
two italian sentries with fixed bayonets
were keeping guard over her

  im arrested  she called when she
saw me and she didnt seem worried

  the sentries wouldnt let me go near
we stood ten feet apart while we talked
she said that her trucks had been slow on
the road and one had broken down om-
ing over the mountains near grenoble
the italians wouldnt allow them to cross
the frontier so the men had simply un-
loaded everything and lucy had been
there since seven oclock that morning

  now and again different officials had
been down to look at her and shed had
three different reliefs of sentries and she
didnt think being arrested like this was
really serious because one of the sentries
had just given her an apple as if that
meant anything

  ill get the rest of the way somehow
she said

  obviously shed been arrested as a sus-
pect  and being picked up more or less
unaccounted for on any frontier in eu-
rope nowadays can lead to all sorts of
complications

so far as the italians were concerned
here was a girl blown in from no-
where with a lot of other peoples bag-
gage and things being what they were
theyd want to know all about it

  she was she said still broke she had
a few francs but that was all

  but ill be in alessandria before your
race starts she said because i want to
see it and the italians will have to
provide me with transport now after
all theyve stopped my trucks going


the smoky road

through to genoa so theyll just have to
take me there and they cant leave me
sitting beside the road forever either 

as she said that four big army trucks
 came rumbling down the slope be-
hind me and soldiers dropped off them as
they backed around beside the luggage
things happened then

 the sentries moved lucy and stood
close guard over her an officer had me
shifted to the far side of the road they
halted all traffic coming in from france
then began to pitch the baggage aboard
the trucks

  lucy looked across at me and smiled
triumphantly when she saw them doing
that in no time at all the trucks were
loaded and starting back the way they
had come with lucy small and wide-
eyed sitting on the baggage in the front
truck she had a sentry on each side
and she was waving back to me like a kid
on a hayride

  there had been something very efficient
and very threatening in the way those
soldiers had come up i started to run
through the dust that the trucks raised
and i stayed with them until they took
a side road just short of the frontier post
then a sentry stopped me

  i argued with him but that got me no-
where men came over from the post
and as far as i could make out she had
been taken to the frontier guard barracks
for examination after that they told
me to get going they sent a couple of
men with me to the fiat to make sure
that i did

  i drove down the road for about a mile
then pulled onto the grass and stopped

  i knew enough about the general situ-
ation to realize that when youre grabbed
on a frontier as lucy lad been its just
your bad luck being wartime they are
likely to stick you in jug and there
you stay until every sta tement you make
is verified-and who was there to speak
for lucy  the least they would do
would be to give her the whale of a grill-
ing and theyd also give that baggage a
going-over like nobodys business shed
probably be held for days and she
wouldnt be given a de luxe room with
bath either

  i wondered if i could strike that side
road somewhere above the sentry get
through to the barracks vouch for her
and help to explain things so i left the
car and started across the field beyond

  inside five minutes i found myself
jumping trenches at the end of another

five minutes i had lost all idea of direc-
tion and was dodging swathes of barbed
wire and ducking around block-houses it
was when i took time out to look at some
tank-traps things id never seen close up
that an officer and six men came from
nowhere and surrounded me

  half an hour after leaving the car i
was in a guardhouse being searched
they took away my passport and put me
in a cell and it was dark when they
brought me out again an english-speak-
ing italian had turned up and he said
that he knew nothing of any american
girl or her baggage

  he was as suspicious as a rat and what
i told him about being there for the
circuito dalessandria didnt seem to
count he asked more questions than i
would have believed possible-the nation-
ality of my great-grandparents when i
arrived in europe-what for why
where had i been since  could i prove
it  he questioned me for two hours then
put me back in the cell

  i knew that lucy must be in another
cell in some other guardhouse going
through the same thing and i cursed my-
self for having gone to emile pepin if
i hadnt shed have worked things out
for herself some other way and would
never have been in this jam

  around midnight they gave me two
blankets and a bowl of soup by that
time i was desperate it looked as though
theyd do nothing more until morning
and i hadnt helped lucy and would miss
the race as well

  i cat-napped all night around eight
oclock in the morning they gave me
bread beans and the lousiest coffee ive
ever tasted and at ten they took me out
of the cell the italian was there and
with him was gazzini and two race offi-
cials from alessandria they identified
me

vou will go under escort to alessan-

  i dria the italian said you may
take part in the race he went on the
venezia sails from genoa at three oclock
on the day following this race you will
be escorted to the boat and you will
arrange to sail aboard her if you fail to
do this you will be rearrested you
may go

  we went i had to take an italian cop
with me on the fiat and another rode
with gazzini we were halfway back to
alessandria-moving all out because the
race started at two oclock-when i re-
membered something


  i wouldnt have enough money to buy
a passage on the venezia-unless i did
something good in the race

  even if i did i wasnt going to sail
and leave lucy behind id rather go
back in the jug

  the miller was back-marker in the
line-up id entered late and i hadnt
lapped at a speed that would qualify for
a better position the machines were set
in rows of three the fastest in front and
mechanics were standing by waiting for
the one-minute signal before they started
up the motors

  gazzini was to give me the usual sig-
nals from boards at the pit and hed flag
me in for refueling on the fortieth lap
id had no time for anything except to
change into driving kit check the model
over and read a good-luck cable from
kinnaird

  everywhere was color and excitement
the crowd was packed in the grand-
stand and behind palisades edging the
road this might be the last race until
the war was over the men on the front
cars were there to make it a good one

  the sun burned down and i found my-
self tense and strung up my abdomi-
nal belt seemed to bite my middle and
the safety-strap cut across my thighs i
forced myself to take it easy and tried
to wipe from my mind worries about
lucy passage money my escort of cops
i reminded myself that i was there to race
and show some of them the way home
then the arm of the starting semaphore
lifted in the one-minute signal

  gazzini and his mechanics push-started
me then shoved the auto back into place
with the motor roaring and i was all set
he patted my shoulder yelled good
wishes then dived away with all the other
mechanics and left twenty cars howling
on the road the sun catching their paint
through the smoke they made

i snicked into gear and watched the
semaphore it worked on a rope and
would twitch up a shade before it ac-
tually fell i was going to start on that
twitch jump some of the machines ahead
and get on the tails of the fast ones-
men like tazio pagello italys ace on
an alfa-romeo otto henrich a cham-
pion german road-race driver on the
mercedes and there was borzacchi a
rich amateur on a twin-motored fabri-
calla and that was a car it had a
motor front and rear and he sat between
them it was an experimental model
and the thing was terrific

  those three were together in a row
near the front and those race-wise boys
were the men i wanted to ride with mak-
ing their race-tactics my own

the tip of the semaphore suddenly
jerked i let up the clutch and my
rear wheels spun for grip before they
kicked me away i had the miller streak-
ing to the outside of the road while the
red arm was still coming down

  i shot past two rows of cars before
theyd moved a yard wheel-hubs skim-
ming the front of the stand the crowd on
its feet for the start and yelling spec-
tators jumped back from the palisades
scared that id catch the fence then i
was up where i wanted to be and already
the front rows were traveling

  i was almost kissing wheel-hubs with
ottos mercedes when we all came to the
first turn-a left-hand corner with a
stone-masons yard on the outside i
gave the miller all shed take and stayed
with them as i went around the outside
of the curve

  two hundred y ards ahead was a right-
hand turn over an iron bridge i had
otto and the two italian cracks with me
wheel to wheel id either got to get
ahead or be crowded out for the brfdge

  i held the throttle wide when they
braked shot by made a straight-through
gear-shift then stood on everything-
and the miller went onto the bridge in
a lovely clipped turn that left the ger-
man and the others at my tail

  now i was nicely set there were
six cars ahead five italians and a sil-
very auto-union setting the pace with a
dog-fight my plan was to stay there
until they had sorted themselves out
and the three cracks seemed to have the
same idea because they sat on my tail
and didnt try to pass

  we went off the bridge into a long
curve then hit that fast stretch where
the road formed an embankment the
six were tipping at  mph all along
the straightaway shifting position all
the time they slowed for the hairpin
turn at the end with blasts of flame com-
ing from their exhausts and went
through in a heap with me taking their
dust and smoke as i followed a hail of
stones from their back wheels hitting my
radiator guard

  the road curved onto another iron
bridge recrossing the river there was
a bend with giant elms edging a ditch
on its outside then the road straight-
ened in the stretch back to town


  the pace-makers went down that in a
tight bunch the auto-unions tires skim-
ming doorsteps in the home turn one
of them tried to pinch inches hit the
corner too fast and started to slide

  he shot across the road broadsiding
at a sandbank i saw him catch it and
saw the underside of his auto as it keeled
up with spectators at the fence above
yelling-ducking running for their
lives

  then i was through the turn and go-
ing past the grandstand id started
last and i was coming round with only
five ahead at the end of the first lap
which was not so bad i stayed there
watching what happened in the dog-fight
in front

  the german on the auto-union was a
devil with magnificent nerve the ital-
ians were like wild men i could see
that something was bound to go and
two laps later an italian put his outside
wheels on the grass verge along the
raised straight

  i saw his rear tire kick black earth
as the wheel spun for grip and didnt
find it his tail started to slide out and
i yelled into the wind the way you al-
ways do hold it for gods sake-
hold ft

he couldnt hold it his tail slashed
suddenly and the machine spun off
the road pitching to the field below the
tail hit first and crumpled digging into
the soft earth the car reared pirouet-
ting for the fraction of a second  then the
speed sent it somersaulting in great
splashes of dust and the sound of its
crashing came through the noise of my
own machine as i went by

  i put from my mind what id seen i
wouldnt look at his smoking wreck
when i cleared the hairpin nor at the
other one jammed across the sandbank
on the home corner-nor at the crowd
where still another had slugged through
a fence by the first iron bridge

  three wrecks inside four laps-and
another italian dropped out of the dog-
fight with smoke slashing in bannerets
from the louvres of his motor hood hed
put a con rod through his crankcase

  that finished the dog-fight and it put
me in fourth place the auto-union
took the lead and lifted the pace now
that he wasnt hampered by close-riding
cars i sat where i was with the three
cracks still behind me the miller had
a lot in hand and the machines ahead
werent getting away

knowing she was there was like
having the champagne again

  ten laps ran out-twenty and i was
still sitting fourth here and there au-
tos were pulled off the road broken by
the pace or by bad judgment there
were two more wrecks one on the sec-
ond bridge but the machine had bounced
clear of the course

  thirty laps-then i heard a growing
scream through the shriek of my blow-
ers and otto suddenly took his mer-
cedes past jumping me at once pagello
followed his car a howling shape of scar-
let and while i was yet putting my foot
right down borzacchi shot up with
them

  they had the fastest cars in the race
and knew it theyd been waiting until
other machines put themselves out and
left the course clearer and now the three


the blue book magazine

cars were starting to warm up for the
real fight

  that was okay with me if i could
stay on their tails until i felt ready to
make my own challenge the miller
was behaving beautifully and she stayed
with them all right as they started to
peg back the machines ahead the lead-
ing auto-union was the toughest to
pass and he hung with me for a clear
lap before he dropped away hed
spoiled the tune of his machine in the
opening laps

  the three cracks traveled in a tight
bunch on the straights i had to lift
the miller to her limit to hold them   

  then i saw gazzini signaling me in
for replenishment next time round and
they were being flagged from their pits
too

they were smart those three theyd
worked up enough lead over every-
thing else in the race-bar the miller-to
refuel and get away again and still be in
front over the final distance of twenty
laps theyd get down to real work

 we came to the home turn and
wheeled for the pits i slid up braking
hard ignition off we had to change all
wheels and tank up and i left work on
the car to gazzini

  i climbed out and made for the pit
counter and found my escort of cops
helping out one had a bottle of cham-
pagne and a bucket the other had a
towel-lemon fresh driving-gloves and
clean goggles i stuck my head in the
bucket and the champagne came froth-
ing down through my hair stinging the
stone-cuts on my cheeks and jaw but it
was good-cold and refreshing

  i swabbed off used water to swill the
dust from my mouth then sucked
the lemon while i shuffled my shoes in the
sand theyd spilled on the road for me
gazzini and four mechanics were work-
ing like madmen over the car then
he was yelling and i started back-hel-
met on goggles gloves-into the cock-
pit snapping over the safety-strap as
the car came off the jacks

  the crowd was shouting and i caught
gazzinis voice away ahead i saw otto
-and pagello and borzacchi-already
clear of their pits cornering at the end
of the grandstand straight then gaz-
zini and the mechanics were push-start-
ing the car the hot motor stalled-
stalled again-suddenly roared and i
was into it once more with twenty laps
to go and three cars ahead

  those three would now be going ab-
solutely all out faster than before wed
come into the pits when id been able
to hold them only by using pretty well
everything the miller had

  if i now hit every corner at the limit
if i worked to clip inches if i opened
wide down every straight and flogged the
motor for acceleration then i might just
hold them but i didnt think i could
come up with them let alone pass

  only-a race is never over until the
winner is home and so i went after it
with all id got i had to anyway be-
cause i needed seme of that race money

  each time i went by gazzini showed
me how many laps were left the fig-
ures clipped down and the three cracks
stayed out of sight ahead gazzini
showed me fifteen-fourteen-thirteen
and then in the hairpin turn i saw bor-
zacchis twin-motored job jammed into
a great palisade of railway sleepers

  it was smashed and smoking with
men clambering over the fence and offi-
cials running hed come too fast to the
turn and had kept straight on instead
of going round on every lap i felt that
was liable to happen to me i was driv-
ing so hard	

i kept at it chasing the two in front
taking chances and bringing them off
with the cockpit like an oven now and
the sun blazing down with grit in my 
mouth and ears and my brain starting
to ache from the drilling screech

  twelve laps-eleven-ten-nine and
now there were very few cars left in the
race i had the corners to myself and
used all the road as i came to them i
clipped the turns so closely that people
ran back each time they saw me come
and each time i was a bit closer to the
fences

  eight laps-seven-six-five-four
and suddenly i knew i was tiring

  i found myself clenching my teeth on
the corners i had cramp in stomach
and hands my judgment was going so
that my tires screamed on the curves
because i didnt put the car through
them just right

  when gazzini showed me that there
were three laps to go i knew it was no
use i was still flogging myself and the
car but i knew that the men in front
were just too good i still gave it every-
thing but down inside me i knew that it
was no use

  then on that lap i noticed the crowds
yelling at me and waving spectators


the smoky road

were leaning otfer fences hanging out
from the balconies all the way down the
home stretch bending from windows and
sweeping their arms urging the miller
on

  the crowd on the home corner was
wild i could see men shouting at me as
i went through the turn and glanced at
the pit somebody was standing on the
pit counter waving did glory-waving
like mad

  lucy

  lucy swinging the flag above her head
dancing with excitement-gazzini and
an italian army officer with her both
waving

  she saw me look and she almost fell
off the pit-planks as she waved me on-
and then i saw a red car cornering in
the turn ahead and knew it was pagello

  seeing lucy knowing she was there
was like having the champagne over my
head again the cramps went the tired-
ness went-and everywhere the crowds
seemed to have gone mad and were wav-
ing me on

  through the curve screaming at the
bridge-and i caught pagello at the far
side smoke showed a sick motor and
he was looking back watching for me
he lifted an arm sweeping me ahead
mofith open and shouting as i passed

  then i knew what it was all about
there fras only the german in front if
pagello was out of it they wanted me
to catch and beat him

  with lucy there to watch id do it-
or break something

  i went down the raised straight with
the miller going as shed never gone be-
fore and in the back of my mind i was
thinking about lucy

  maybe she had been released under
open arrest like me maybe shed have
to go back to jug if she hadnt passage
money but if i caught otto thered
be money enough to take us both home

  into the hairpin-through it-down
the home-stretch and the crowds were
wilder than before-men bawling wom-
en screaming for me to go still faster
hats and bunting and arms waving-
sending me on to where a blur of dust
hung on the smoky road ahead

  that i knew was otto

on the home turn i splintered the in-
side palings with my wheel-hubs
and gazzinis board told me i was enter-
ing the last lap lucy was holding the
flag not waving-just watching crouched
and tense

  i saw the sun flash whitely in the dust
ahead as otto placed the mercedes for
the turn i was a quarter-mile behind
him as i followed over the bridge-howl-
ing through the long curve onto the fast
straightaway for the last time

  i couldnt tell if i was gaining but i
saw him hit the hairpin-and i saw him
skid dust and stones shot like a wave
from the torn road-surface and i yelled
into the cockpit because i knew that
skid would slow him

he was still clearing the turn when i
went into it holding my speed until
some instinct told me that longer would
be fatal-straight-through gear changes
braking with the car kicking under me
tires screeching-then whoom-m-m-m
said the exhaust as the miller kicked the
turn behind and left speed-spume flying

  otto was still straightening his auto
for the bridge and there was not ten
yards between us when he found his
speed and held me off then i saw that
id lost a tire-tread from my off-front
wheel

  the breaker-strip was showing that
meant a blow-out any moment and i
prayed the tire would hold and not burst
when we took the home corner because
it was there that id win or lose the race
now

  otto would cut it close id have to
corner outside him go around him while
he was still in the turn ijf the tire went
or if i skidded then it would be cur-
tains all right

  the crowd along the home-stretch had
stopped yelling the people at the win-
dows and on the balconies were quite
still-just watching

  that last turn cariie up and otto
eased out for it i held the center of the
road he wheeled for the corner square
across my track the crowds at the
fences became one gaping mouth as they
gasped when it seemed i must ram him
then i was braking-braking and chang-
ing down all but nicking the tip of his
tail as i shot past and threw the miller
into the turn with everything screaming

  i felt her start to slide i took weight
off the brakes and stamped the throttle
wide if the rear wheels bit the road
id shoot straight and if they didnt
they would aggravate the skid and kill
me in the crack-up

  they bit-threw me level with him
i saw him look his mouth a slit below
black goggles i saw his head bend as
he asked the white mercedes for what


the blue book magazine

he needed to win    then he was fall-
ing behind and the miller was pitching
herself ahead as the black-and-white fin-
ishing line across the road slashed up-
slid to meet me-slipped under my front
wheels as the checkered flag whipped
down

  that front tire blew out a hundred
yards beyond the line but it didnt mat-
ter then

two hours later i was sitting on a cot
above gazzinis garage easing off the
cramps feeling clean and relaxed after
a shower lucy was sitting on the side
of the cot with iodine and swabs on a
chair shed been treating the cuts that
stones had left on my face

  id collected checks for five thousand
bucks winners money plus bonus
money plus starting money so there
was no need to go back to the jug

  i really had a perfectly wonderful
time after i was arrested at modane
lucy was telling me you see the
commandant of the frontier guards used
to be an attache at washington he
and his wife insisted that i be their
guest overnight 

  shed been having a wonderful time
while id been in a cell worried about
her the commandant and his wife
had brought her down to alessandria in
time for the race bringing the baggage
on the trucks which had first picked it
up lucy hadnt been able to get
through to the pit until near the finish
when shed seen how things were going

 i wanted to let you know i was
watching she said and sort of wave
you on

  the commandant had fixed it for her
to sail on the venezia using his influence
so that she neednt pay for her passage
until after she arrived in new york be-
cause she was still broke the trucks
were taking the baggage down to the
boat and she had nothing more to bother
about

  she was very pleased with herself be-
cause she believed that she had done all
that she had set out to do but i
couldnt forget the arrangement id made
with pepin in paris she hadnt made
out in the way she thought id deceived
her about it and that took the edge off
everything for me

  id won the race i was going to be
guest of honor at the banquet in the eve-
ning and lucy would be there every-
one in sight was pleased with me and
kinnaird and his mess would stage their

whale of a party when they got the cable
id sent everything should have been
tops with me-but i felt lousy because
id cheated lucy

  she straightened out the iodine and
the swabs on the chair and it suddenly
got quiet the town was noisy outside
but the quiet in the room was close she
put everything straight then she spoke
without looking at me

  by the way i never used that mans
trucks you know 

trucks my heart took a dive
you sent that pepin to me didnt
you  she said accusingly i guessed
it and he admitted it finally hes
mailing your money back to you

  that left me with nothing to say she
knew the way id interfered and this
was my finish

  i didnt need him because i arranged
a deal with the owner of the garage in
rue monsigny she said he gave me
transportation for the baggage in return
for a ten-per-cent interest im to send
his money when i get home

she fiddled with the things on the
chair

  so i have come through all on my
own she said quietly after a bit 
she stood up i thought she was go-
ing to walk out on me but suddenly she
whirled round her voice rising

  i thought you were rooting for me
she exclaimed smiling now i made
it arent you pleased 

  her eyes were alight and she was
laughing

  arent you mad at me  i asked and
came off the cot

  mad she laughed again mad
no why i think youve been absolute-
ly swell 

  suddenly everything came right

  i think you were darned nice about
what you tried to do for me in paris
she said and i think youre a grand
driver she went on and i think its
grand that weve both come through
with what we started out to do

  sure it was grand shed made out
all on her own-all the way

  you bet it was grand-and we were
going home together on the same boat

  i reminded her of that and she
laughed-laughed so that her long lashes
closed and made you wait for her eyes
to come peeping through again

  and the boat would take nine days to
get across

death
on the doorstep

 gordon keyne

     who wrote they lived by the sword
     and gunpowder gold

the manner in which i chanced
to see the body on the doorstep
was in itself a bit noteworthy
strictly speaking there was no
doorstep dr mortons house like most
of the smaller places in pine springs
was built flat on the desert sand

  wakening unusually early about six
i slipped into trunks and sweat-shirt
and went out to get the morning paper
at the gate our cottage was surround-
ed by a picket fence this was why we
had leased it my sister bathsheba saw
tht fence and babbled rapturously to
high heaven a colonial cottage and a
picket fence amid the adobe concrete
and plaster palaces of this western re-
sort warmed her new england heart
i dislike incongruous things but she
brushes aside all such trifles the house
was ours for the season

  picking up the tightly rolled news-
paper i noticed a car standing across
the street in front of mortons house
as i drank the morning air into my
lungs with sheer sensuous enjoyment
like the sunrise and sunset air of egypt
that of pine springs has an almost inde-
scribable quality one feels it like a very
substance balmy and mellifluous grate-
ful to the skin and lungs alike

  this being early october the sun was
just above the horizon a blazing ball of
golden fire impregnating all things with
quivering life the big tamarisk at the
front of the morton place struck me
with sudden contrast under those level
rays its yellow-green masses held blue
ominous shadows it too came from
egypt i recollected those feathery
fronds that changed not with the seasons
impacted upon me with a queerly sinis-
ter note as though some dread horror
lingered here unseen  be wakened with
the morning light

  i dispelled the feeling with a laugh
rather it was dispelled by sight of the
car across the street this was a large
expensive luxurious imported coupe
and its presence was vaguely puzzling

  dr morton was one of the oldest in-
habitants he had been here long be-
fore pine springs became a winter resort
for idlers of great wealth as a physi-
cian he no longer practised though he
did retain a few patients of long stand-
ing he was a scholar a quiet lovable
old man very much a recluse

  i knew him rather well from our oc-
casional meetings also his famous work
on the origin of rag paper in china
had for years been one of my technical
standbys much of his early life had
been spent in china where his son and
daughter-in-law had died leaving him
one granddaughter with kathy mor-
ton bathsheba and i were on intimate
terms though not so intimate as i could
wish

  a six-foot wall surrounded the adobe
house and large gardens despite evi-
dently ample wealth the mortons lived
most simply with a secretary and a fili-
pino houseboy thus sight of the rath-
er blatant car at their gate was momen-
tarily puzzling

  glancing past the car i saw that the
heavy wooden gates stood open some-
thing inside those gates on the wide
concrete slab in front of the porch
jerked at my attention and instantly
the sense of lurking hovering horror re-
turned and took tangible shape the
body of a man lay there ana i knew
at once that the man was dead

  the statement is not fantastic i
have been a consultant technician to the
law in three great cities and my courses
on the subject of physical evidence are
used by many police-instruction schools


the blue book magazine

while often termed a criminologist i
am let us hope something more than
this ill-used term implies

  as i have often pointed out there is a
distinct sense of death as there is a dis-
tinct sense of emptiness in an abandoned
house a sensitive person cannot mis-
take a sleeping man or a sleeping dog
for a dead one a person acquainted
with death recognizes it when he sees it
or more properly feels it

bathsheba and i were just back
from a years trip around the world
bathsheba devoting herself to flirting
and gushing while i put in some hard
licks studying technical police methods
from lyons to singapore for the past
two months i had secluded myself here
in pine springs in order to translate my
notebooks into factual pages leaving
bathsheba to flit about town and enjoy
life in her own way

  i wanted no link with publicity my
first impulse was to turn away from the
dead man however on the chance that
i might be wrong that he might be alive
and in need of help i started across the
street

  pausing briefly at the car and glanc-
ing into it nothing caught my eye ex-
cept a slight compact blob of mud on
the floor-mat beneath the steering-
wheel and i passed on through the open
gates and up to the prostrate figure

  let me regretfully admit that its posi-
tion at the moment struck me as odd
but not significant the right leg was
crossed at a sharp angle across the left
leg the right arm lay across the breast
the left arm was extended above the
head and bent acutely at the elbow as
though warding off a blow the face
was that of a young man weakly self-
indulgent unknown to me

  possible crime i must emphasize was
far from my thought in order to feel
the heart i moved the right arm and
straightened it down beside the thigh
it flexed freely at the elbow but life was
extinct either rigor mortis had not set
in or it was far from complete almost
mechanically i looked for some indica-
tion of the cause of death but there
was none

 the young mans garments won my
attention he wore a veldt shirt and
slacks of heavy blue tussore silk and a
handsome jacket of merino and sufede-
garb such as is commonly worn for day
or evening alike by resorters the odd
thing was the absolute newness of the

garments the shirt showed its pristine
folds the crease of the slacks was like a
knife-edge the jacket was brand new
the rope-soled sandals on the feet
showed no wear

  with a shrug i rose and stepped
across the porch to the door this was
not my affair i wanted none of it and
would have none of it regret over this
discovery assailed me while crossing to
the bell now i must give my evidence
and my time and work must suffer en-
croachment though it might still be pos-
sible to avoid publicity

  i pressed the bell after some little
time the door was opened by the secre-
tary jessop i would far sooner have
seen anyone else in the house

  i disliked jessop heartily he was a
small slightly stooped man of about
fifty with thick-lensed spectacles bath-
sheba called him a prissy fellow which
describes him rather aptly

 why its mr bodham he ex-
claimed staring at me in surprise is
anything wrong sir

  i hope not the mans subservient
air flecked me on the raw you seem
to have a caller here-

  jessop saw the dead man he let jut
a startled grunt as though he had been
hit under the belt and his jaw fell

  do you know who it is i asked

  why-why yes he said in sudden
agitation yes sir young mr devry
hes a patient in a way of dr mor-
tons

  abruptly he broke off his eyes wid-
ened on the body as though something
about it had struck into him with swift
dismay i turned away

  its your funeral i said rather bru-
tally phone the police and dont
touch the corpse

  ignoring him further i walked back
across the street

there for the first time it occurred
to me that i myself had touched the
body-i of all people however it did
not seem in the least important and i
could not undo the mistake now without
drawing the attention of jessop that
clenched hand across the breast might
have indicated heart-trouble i thought
the young man had been trying to
reach the doctor had keeled over and
died on the spot this seemed clear

  indeed nothing else seemed possible
i had been in this quiet desert resort for
a month its peculiar nerve-quieting
influence had left me composed utterly


death on the doorstep

forgetful of cities and their ways the
brilliant sunlight balmy yet vibrant
air the mountains behind and the desert
vistas before had relieved all tenseness
and high-strung restiveness

   despite floods of tourists nothing ever
happened here except the usual mur-
derous highway accidents off the main
routes of travel pine springs bred a fic-
titious activity for the sake of the visi-
tors yet could not break away from its
ancient peace its tranquil trees and
moonlight and solitude of nights coy-
otes howled close to the town and of
days the far vistas of sky and desert were
friendly neighbors crime did not exist
here except perhaps on the indian reser-
vation a police force of eight men
and an indian agent handled anything
that might come up

when i stepped into the cottage
bathsheba met me with her radiant
smile she was just zipping her sun-suit
jup to the neck

i i heard you prowling around and
here i am she said brightly sit
down and dont fuss breakfast is on
the way whats the news this morn-
ing have the british won the war
wlfat did the market do yesterday i
do hope aircraft stocks went up do
you want orange-juice and coffee both
yes i replied simply

  to bathsheba questions are merely
a form of conversation to be rattled off
without thought of response yet she
is an attractive thing even my broth-
erly eye approves her exterior she is
lovely as a dresden china shepherdess
and has fully as weighty a brain

  despite our superficial bickering
bashy and i have always understood
each other extraordinarily well and her
butterfly point of view has frequently
been of the greatest help to me a sun-
nier and more equably tempered person
i have never known

   you might at least read me the head-
lines she said cheerfully as she bustled
about the kitchen come tom whats
the biggest item of news this morning
dead man across the street i re-
joined on dr mortons doorstep
that is if you can call it a doorstep
she stopped short her blue eyes wide
and startled

   are you joking

  no i said absently sipping my
orange-juice and eying the newspaper
no its a serious thing the door-
step or threshold has a very prominent

place in primitive or even in evolved
civilization the significance is some-
times very grave-

  thomas bodham she meant busi-
ness this time stop treating me like a
child you dont mean that dr morton
is dead

  god forbid hes in bed so far as i
know but theres certainly a dead man
on his doorstep i called out that ass
jessop and left the matter to him none
of my business since i discovered the
body i suppose the coroner will want
my evidence

  who is the-the dead man

  stranger to me i did not wish to
discuss the thing endlessly

  bathsheba fluttered why this is
simply terrible tom it cant be pos-
sible they never have any dead peo-
ple here in pine springs why only
yesterday mrs mcmanus was saying
that the nearest undertaker is at pretona
and its a great argument for tourists
that no one ever dies here i suppose if
theres any danger of death they take
the poor creature to pretona or roydron
or somewhere its rather absurd to
what lengths these resorts will go in the
effort to encourage visitors why dont
you do something about it

  im not interested in the pine
springs tourist trade

  silly you know very well that i
mean the dead man thats your busi-
ness mysteries and murders and all
that sort of thing youre famous for
things you do with microscopes and
queer apparatus    heres your cof-
fee mind its hot why dont you take
charge of it

i looked up from the paper give
me some cream and i will

  dont take that attitude tom i
mean the dead man

  do you want me to drag him in here
for breakfast

  please tom-i dont like you a bit
when you assume that cynical air its
not you at all bashy was flushed and
serious and with a sigh i abandoned
the newspaper when you put on this
horrid blase mask youre not a nice
man other times youre simply grand
now be yourself think of kathy and
poor dr morton you should save them
trouble here

  now bashy lower your sights i
began theyre in no trouble theres
no crime or mystery no police matter
nothing to save them from-
the blue book magazine

  memory checked me memory of the
dead mans singular position she did
not notice it however and i hurried on
i dont want to be hauled into the
thing as a friend of the family let the
cops cart the man off hes just some
patient trying to reach the doctor and
keeled over before getting to the house
i have more important stuff on hand
the work of the singapore police among
the malay and chinese criminal socie-
ties has some fascinating angles then i
must check on those curious cases in
cairo so oddly related to the bombay
murders of last year-

athsheba sat down and reached
for the front section of the paper
very well tom but dr morton is
a darling old man kathys an angel
you should help them  i wonder
what the mans name was

  devry i said absently here lis-
ten to what lee shippey says in his col-
umn-

  devry bathsheba fairly exploded
tom you knew it all the time you
say its devry nathaniel devry

  good lord i gulped my coffee
and rose cant i even read the morning
paper in peace yes jessop knew him
why everybody knows him here
bathsheba gawked at me nathaniel
iv they call him-you know the devry
family of baltimore the multi-million-
aires the fabulous house of devry as
a magazine article called it only two
months ago

  oh i had heard of that family nat-
urally everyone in america had heard
of them hadnt occurred to me it
was that family

  they have a place here cried bath-
sheba enjoying herself now that
enormous house up on the mountain
slope nathaniel iii and his family are
there now you must have heard of
the young man tom hes famous for
his wild parties and his hard drinking
and the scandals he has caused

  i dont read the scandal sheets i
broke in you may be right bashy
so what none of my business this
makes it more emphatically none of my
business if youre right about the
corpse its not a death-its an event i
want nothing to do with it

  bathsheba drew down her brows at
me why did you lie about not know-
ing him

  i dont lie charming she-sister
didnt think about his name didnt

care dont care now dont expect to
care now are you satisfied

  no she said at times bathsheba
has an astonishing gift of penetration
you did lie youre worried there
are things about iit you havent told
me

  suit yourself i retorted and went
to my study

  to myself i admitted that my sister
was right odd little things stuck in my
mind such as the position of the corpse
the newness of the garments the blob of 
mud on the car floor things that some-
how struck me instinctively as unnatu-
ral like the waving of a bush on a wind-
less day why i refused to ask myself
the question or seek any answer

  the only thing in connection with the
entire matter that worried me was how
this grisly morning sight would affect
kathy morton that had been a shrewd
thrust on bathshebas part she must
have i reflected some suspicion that i
thought a lot more of kathy than i was
willing to admit to anyone and so i
did

  resolutely shoving the whole thing
aside i spent an hour at intensive work
on my notes and so absorbed was iin
my work that when bathsheba appeared
i had forgotten the mornings incident

  they want you tom she said
the coroner has come from roydron
and an officer is here to get you

  oh i exclaimed the dead man
of course yes ill be right out

a local office r was on the porch
cars were in the street and as we
started across a small crowd was visible in
the morton grounds as we approached
the officer identified those whom i did
not know the local police chief bishop
the county coroner and assistants a
spare nervous man with tear-streaked
cheeks who was nathaniel iii father of
the dead man and a few others the
body was of course covered over then
there were kathy and her grandfather
with jessop and the filipino houseboy

  kathy was naturally troubled and
anxious dr morton was giving evi-
dence to the coroners panel and kathy
came to me with a quick greeting

  this is a terrible thing does bashy
know about it

  more or less i said was this
man a friend of yours

  no only a slight acquaintance
kathy had none of bathshebas radi-
ance she was dark a dusky glow in her

death on the doorstep

tanned face her dark eyes very vibrant
and alive usually quick to laughter
she was now grave and steady her high-
boned features eloquent of the restraint
that means strength

  dr mortons words caught my ear his
low gentle voice agitated a coronary
lesion-thrombosis no i cannot ac-
count for his position sir perhaps a
spasmodic muscular elfort in the instant
of death i did not need to disturb the
body death was quite evident

  as he was a patient of yours jn a
way will you be prepared to vouch for
the cause of death

  absolutely said morton it was
obvious i treated him five days ago
the doctor i saw was much agitated
hewas one of those eld men who seem
to deserve the word saintly long snow-
white hair fell about delicately carven
features of tremendous strength-jutting
nose and chin chiseled as by buonarotti
yet all imbued with a surpassing tender-
ness a gentle wisdom he glanced at
me smiled and nodded and the cor-
oner dismissed him

  i was then taken in hand my testi-
mony was simple and brief the police
who had finished their work with cam-
era and tape lifted the covering from
the body momentarily

  yes i replied to the question
thats the man

  do you know him

  never saw him before to my knowl-
edge

  the body is just as you first saw it
yes i said as they covered it from
sight again

  thats all mr bodham youll be
available for the regular inquest of
course this is merely the preliminary
hearing

  bathsheba had ordered me to bring
kathy over for breakfast since dr
morton was talking with nathaniel dev-
ry iii and jessop kathy readily accept-
ed and we crossed the street together to
the cottage

  as i held the gate open for her an
odd fact suddenly impacted on my
brain perhaps it had been delayed by
my absorption in kathy for i am not
ordinarily such a downright nitwit

  i had told the coroner heedlessly that
the body was just as i had first seen it
this was true and this was the singu-
lar thing-that it was just as i had first
seen it however the matter was of no
moment i reflected the coroner or dr
morton had replaced that right arm
across the breast it might even have
reassumed that position itself with ad-
vancing rigor mortis so i thought no
more of it-until later

chapter two

on the second day after the prelimi-
nary hearing the actual inquest
took place i gathered that the delay
was to enable certain relatives to arrive
from the east in the interim i also
heard-from bathsheba since i did not
read the numerous newspaper spreads-
a host of details regarding the wild life
and reckless career of young devry

  the coroner very decently held the
inquest at the local police station to
save all witnesses the trip to the mortu-
ary at pretona i arrived to find high-
way police controlling traffic and the
street outside the police- and fire-station
packed with people augmented by the
batteries of photographers and reporters
from los angeles the death of na-
thaniel iv was no national calamity but
it was a national news item

  the fabulous house of devry as the
newspapers had come to call it was to
be well represented i had come with
the morton party and was talking with
kathy on the outskirts of the throng
when an enormous green limousine
drew to a hissing stop at the white strip
before the station a young chinese
in livery hopped briskly out and opened
the door
the blue book magazine

  the spare nervous man whom i
knew to be nathaniel iii emerged and
assisted two heavily veiled women to the
cement-the mother and sister of the
deceased news- and camera-men and the
crowd surged forward but the police
checked the onrush the three vanished
inside the station then a fourth person
left the car escorted by a man whom by
his manner i took to be a family lawyer

  a fourth person heavens no
wherever that woman was no one else
existed she was one of those people
who fill a room a hall a street with
their personality and who dwarf any
and everyone around them she was
obviously of great age she had a hawk-
like face such as the mummy of rameses
the great exhibits and a great dome of
a head over which thin white hair was
drawn severely back

  a queer old-fashioned cape about her
shoulders was held together with a chain
of strung jade-the deep emerald gem
jade only to be had by fabulous weath
her hands were gaunt but steady her
step firm and elastic she faced the
yawping camera-men with scornful si-
lence her black eyes unwinking

  kathy pressed my arm

  miss devry tom the miss devry
-doesnt she look like a legend a myth
a person of fable and story

  i grunted she looks like an old
woman whos hard as hell the miss
devry whos head of the family and runs
the whole business organization eh
ive heard of her if you knew young
devry i suppose you know all these
people

  i only knew him slightly tom-an
acquaintance no more she said gently
grandfather knows them intimately
though i dont think hes ever met them
they all come into his book you know
miss devrys father the first nathaniel
founded the fortune all that should in-
terest you a lot

  you know it doesnt i said sorry
but facts are facts

  thats one thing i like about you
she rejoined in her quiet way youre
really yourself she added and pressed
my arm again

i knew of course that dr mortons
great opus economic america in
china was in course of production and
had been for many years two volumes
had been published and he was work-
ing on other volumes this voluminous
history of the china trade dealt wholly

with commercial aspects and was for-
eign to my interests

  whos the man with miss devry-
looks like a lawyer i asked as the two
disappeared

  peterson she replied her secre-
tary

  he stuck in ones memory long bony
jaw thin hair sunken eyes a servile
manner uriah heep with a clean col-
lar on i commented and kathy gave
a soft laugh

  not bad tom not half bad but
come on theres grandfather waving
at us to get in

  i wormed a way through the press
we followed dr morton and the irritat-
ing jessop through the corridor of the
police-station and into a large room set
aside for the coroners use lack of
room precluded the admission of any
except the witnesses officials and jury
dr morton kathy jessop and i took
the front chairs o a crowded little clus-
ter assigned the witnesses the devry
family sat behind us indeed miss devry
was immediately behind dr morton

the formalities were few and simple
legal identification of the corpse
which was not present had been covered
in the usual manner i was called and
gave my evidence

  i had previously reflected whether or
not to mention any change in the posi-
tion of the body and decided against it
as immaterial unless some reason showed
up to change my decision when i was
dismissed james jessop was called he
was obviously nervous but spoke with
great clarity verifying my brief state-
ment and stating how he had phoned
the police and had summoned dr mor-
ton to look at the body

  can you tell us anything that might
aid in establishing the time of death
asked the coroner

  jessop shook his small ugly head
nothing

  suppose you tell us the movements
of the household that night mr jessop
where shall i begin

  at dinner-who was present

  dr morton miss kathy morton and
myself oh yes-and mr thompson
he comes two or three days a week to do
typing for us sometimes when we work
late he stays for dinner that night we
wanted to finish chapter vi of dr mor-
tons work since it was highly important
that certain books and papers borrowed
from the university-


death on the doorstep

  i hardly think we need much de-
tail mr jessop broke in the coroner
just the main events of the evening
when you retired who might have vis-
ited the house and so on

  no one visited the house said jes-
sop mr thompson left about nine
a little later miss kathy brought the
doctor his usual tray of biscuit and sher-
ry at ten after getting the radio news
dr morton retired i stayed up quite a
bit perhaps an hour preparing the next
days research notes it takes time to get
the documents correlated with-

  quite so mr jessop please tell me
what visitors came during the night
none to my knowledge said jes-
sop with his queer negative jerk

  why do you qualify wouldnt you
have known

  not necessarily my quarters are in
the cottage in the rear some little dis-
tance

  how far came the query just
approximate it

  im trying to recall the number of
steps to the house close to a hundred
and twenty feet let me see-i should
say between a hundred and fifteen and
a hundred and twenty

tihank you during the night you
heard no arrival you heard no car
you heard nothing of unusual import
jessop respectfully dissented to each
question

  after your work in the house was
finished what did you do

  i got a glass of milk in the kitchen
then i went out to- my rooms took a
shower went to bed and read for a lit-
tle while i know i turned out my light
precisely at twelve i try to keep exact
hours it is a matter of habit

                                           i

jessop was dismissed kathy testified
briefly and dr morton followed the
gentle old man was impressive his
profile was not unlike that of miss devry
in its strength and decision but his was
marked by an old-age benignity and hers
was decidedly not

  you have said that the deceased was
a patient of yours will you explain
this statement dr morton

  i gave up my practise years ago
morton replied one evening young
devry brought my granddaughter home
from some social affair he had a heart-
attack while there i looked after him
advising that he consult his physician
he scoffed at me and asked me to pre-
scribe for him i did so several times

after that occasion he dropped in to see
me asking me to have a look at him i
must say frankly that i only did so in
the hope that i might persuade him to
give up the use of alcoholic liquors

  then you considered him in the
light of a patient

  yes i had treated him within the
week

  did death in your opinion result
from natural causes

  i signed the death-certificate on that
assumption there is no question of his
thyroid condition and heart lesion any
excitement at all might have caused his
death

  may we assume that the deceased
feeling an attack coming might have
attempted to reach you and that death
overtook him as he reached your
house

  yes that is my own assumption i
can think of no other reason for his call
during the early morning hours

  can you tell us approximately when
death occurred within the usual lim-
itations

  in my opinion which can only be an
opinion somewhere about three oclock

morton was dismissed and re-
placed by the police surgeon a
local practitioner named gregg a young
decisive and obviously very able man he
differed slightly from morton as to the
time of death placing it at about two
oclock due to the bodys temperature a
jurors question elicited his explanation
that a corpse will cool at the rate of one
degree per hour as to the cause of
death he agreed with dr morton

  there was no wound no indication
of a contusion of any sort 

  would you be able to state positive-
ly that the deceased died from natural
causes

  there was a momentary silence

  no replied gregg i could not so
state unless i had handled him as a
patient but i accept without hesita-
tion the opinion of so eminent a physi-
cian as my confrere dr morton whose
experience and knowledge so far tran-
scend my own

  it was gracefully said and as pretty
an example of professional courtesy as i
could remember like all courteous
things it eased the tension and gave the
room an almost pleasant atmosphere

  gregg was dismissed and the move-
ments of devry during his last night on
earth were followed nothing of inter-
the blue book magazine

est developed until a gawky youth
named elmer nockett came up he was
the parking attendant at the isle of
araby a night-spot located a mile out-
side the city limits devry had spent
the evening here nockett stated that
devry who was a regular patron had
left the place at about one-thirty in the
morning

  did you notice anything unusual
about mr devry that night

  he had been drinking of course he
always did he seemed normal to me
he wasnt drunk

  perhaps he was so drunk as to seem
quite normal

  nockett hesitated on this and finally
admitted the possibility

  and he left the place alone

  nockett hesitated again no he
said reluctantly

 come mr nockett let us have
everything who was with him
rose wong shes a singer at the
araby he was taking her home

rose wong was called and was
brought in having arrived late she
had the peculiar eerie charm of higher-
class chinese girls and the gravely seri-
ous manner of her race one conjec-
tured that when she smiled she would
be a very fascinating young woman the
delicacy of her complexion reminded
me of a mellowed parchment page be-
fore an amber light

  youre employed at the araby miss
wong

  i sing there she stated in a low mu-
sical voice

  are you an american citizen miss
wong

  a hash glittered in her eye as though
from anger at the implication

  yes so is my father so was my
grandfather

  can you tell us anything that might
throw light on the death of mr devry
nothing he drove me to my home
i got out and stood for a moment talk-
ing he did not leave the car he
seemed quite well but-im sorry to say
it but i must-as though he had been
drinking a good deal i said good night
and went in

  what time was it if you know

  i know because i leave the club at
one-thirty sharp when i cease work it
could not have been later than one
forty-five when we parted

  was he in good spirits apparently
  he seemed to be yes

    can you add anything that might
  throw further light on this affair please
  think miss wong is there anything
  that you consider we ought to know
  she sat quite relaxed hands palm up
  in her lap she shook her head slowly
  looking down at her hands and replied
  in the negative i knew instantly that
  she was lying the occidental assum-
  ing that inability to maintain anothers
  gaze is an indication of falsehood looks
  his man in the eye when he lies the
  oriental more conscious than are we of
  the importance of gestures is elaborate-
  ly careful of his hands and body and
  face when he lies and rose wong lied
  but no one else there knew it she was
  dismissed

    formalities ensued-corroborative tes-
  timony of no interest i sat next to dr
  morton as it chanced i thought of the
  old devry woman behind us of the dev-
  ry fortune of the curious chance that
  had turned the black sheep to the com-
  pany of a chinese girl the matter i
  thought was being handled with great
  delicacy for it was obvious that devry
  must have been infatuated with this
  rose wong

    odd this chinese thread in the dvry
  affairs this poor devil lying twisted
  on a doorstep-and suddenly with rapid
  sequence the thing flashed across my
  brain i had moved the right arm
  when the body was found the arm had 
  been moved or had moved back so that
  the hand was across the breast the
  crossed leg the hand over the head the
  other hand across the breast-

    good god morton i muttered
  low-voiced to the old man at my side
  he might have been murdered after
  all you must know what his position
  meant

    dr morton half turned to me i
  shall never forget the look in his face-
  the pallor of those chiseled waxen fea-
  tures the startled light that leaped in
  his eye

    his position he murmured

    of course the sign of death-the
  white lotus society

  for a moment his eyes were fixed
  upon me agitation filled them an
  agitation so appalling so infinitely pa-
  thetic that it actually checked my voice
  his hand fell upon my arm and he
  whispered softly

    not now bodham not here im-
possible to discuss-never dreamed youd
know-yes yes we must talk this over j

death on the doorstep

  very well i assented quietly sup-
pose i run over to your place-when
tonight about eight

  right

  he sighed and relaxed i leaned
back the coroner was instructing his
jury that they should bring in a verdict
of death due to natural causes unless
they saw some reason to the contrary
the six men rose and filed off into an
inner room and a buzz of tongues at
once arose around us

  i paid no heed for i was following
and enlarging upor the sudden train of
thought that had led me to speak so im-
petuously to morton it was informa-
tion upon which i had come in my sing-
apore researches the white lotus so-
ciety had been repressed there with iron
hand it was a secret guild of criminals
that once extended from china down
to the straits in my notes were the
passwords signs and other details of the
societys inner workings the position
in which devry had been found was
known as the sign of death

  therefore one of two deductions was
certain he had not fallen in that twist-
ed position by any chance either he
had been murdered and placed in that

iosition which i had to admit was un-
ikely or else he had died naturally and
been placed in that position after death

i wakened from my abstraction to
find that miss devry who sat directly
behind us was leaning forward and
morton had turned to speak with her

  i want to thank you she was say-
ing in a rich throaty voice for your
kindness in this matter and for trying
to rescue my grandnephew from him-
self i am edna devry

  morton half rose but her hand impa-
tiently detained him sit down sit
down she went on dont make a
fool of yourself with politeness doctor
i was hugely relieved to hear those in-
structions to the jury-now were saved
a final scandal which i had dreaded
morton murmured something i did
not hear she laughed harshly

  dont look so shocked i dare say
im older than you if i can stomach
the thought you certainly can the boy
was wild as a march hare that he got
his comeuppance in a natural fashion
is certainly a relief

  recalling what little i had read about
her i coidd see how the woman had
earned her reputation as a tyrant she
was imperious arrogant both by na-

 ture and position under those shaggy
 white eyebrows her sloe eyes twinkled
 with a grim mirth that was actually
 mephistophelian she obviously took
 delight in shocking those around her
 there was nothing of the haute dame in
 her make-up except her air of com-
 mand she had both the gutter instincts
 and the genius of a napoleon

 before more could be said the cor-
 oners jury filed back into the room
 their verdict was simple death from
 natural causes tension was broken
 the case was ended and the room be-
 gan to empty

   i was looking about for kathy when
 a hand caught my arm the fingers
 gripped like iron i turned and was
 amazed when i found miss devry at
 my side that claw of hers could hurt

   young man i want to have a word
 with you she said abruptly

   you are very kind i began she
 cut me short

   fiddlesticks youre a famous man
 i know who you are you know me
 now come along home with me i want
 a word in private with you ill send
 you home later and keep your mouth
 shut until were in private peterson
 this to the secretary beside her stay
 here and look after all details and take
 a taxi home when youre through come
 along bodham

   i caught kathys eye she flung me a
 smile of understanding and a nod pe-
 terson flung me one sharp lightning-
 swift look that stuck in my memory
 then i allowed miss devry to push off
 and made pretence to be escorting her
 actually she had me in tow like a child

   now i am not a child my first im-
 pulse was to resent her manner very
 actively but i repressed the impulse
 in my experience pliancy has won far
 more than self-assertion i am none of
 your fictional sleuths with piercing gaze
 and a diabolic know-all brain i am
 twenty-eight average in size brown hair
 and eyes and mustache and a big nose
 as bathsheba has said i have a face like
 a bent elbow

   so i let miss devry propel me and
 said nothing i was conscious of her tre-


the blue book magazine

-irfendotis mental force her personality
and i could sense a certain hostility i
am sensitive to such impressions and
they have served me well as in the curi-
ous philadelphia episode of the limping
man which turned me from legal study
to that of criminology

  outside cameras clicked and news-
men vociferously demanded a state-
ment miss devry totally ignored them

chapter three

that ride to the devry estate up on
the shoulder of the mountain was
no pleasant one i was introduced to
nathaniel iii who with his wife made
a superbly colorless pair and to their
daughter mrs andrey who put back
her veil to display an arrogant selfish
face devoid of either beauty or grief

  mrs devry maintained a monotonous
sniffling which drove the old dowager
to fury

  for the love of heaven viola she
snapped save your tears to impress the
public youve let the boy gallop
around like a maniac without wasting
a thought on him-so at least be con-
sistent

  neither devry nor his wife made any
reply evidently these people had an
acute disregard perhaps even hatred
for one another

  leaving the streets of the town the
big car cautiously negotiated the turns
of a winding climbing road broad
sweeps of masonry and long retaining
walls came into view the house stood
upon an enormous cut sliced into the
sloping flank of the mountain itself

  we came out on a great slab of cool
jade-green cement at least an acre in
extent in the center was a spacious
fountain and tiled lily pool overhung
by tall palms transplanted and set at
varying angles the house was at the
back of this ledge against the naked
reddish granite of san jacinto in any
other setting it would have seemed gar-
gantuan here it was dwarfed by the
immensity of the mountain behind and
above and the outspread desert reaches
below for it had a view of the town and
all the upper valley beyond across to
the sandy hills that rimmed the horizon

  come along mr bodham utter-
ly ignoring the others miss devry led
me into the house and straight to a
front corner room whose balcony com-
manded all that glorious view this

  is my own room and when im here
  thank god nobody dares disturb me
  sit down sit down

     -she settled herself in a chair beside a
  huge flat-topped desk lit a cigarette
  and inhaled thinly

    all right speak out she command-
  ed why did you tell morton the boy
  was murdered and what does the posi-
  tion of the body mean out with it
  with a start i knew instantly that she
  had overheard my incautious utterance
  she smiled grimly at my expression

  yes ive ears like a cat and a
damned good thing it is sometimes she
snapped answer

  i leaned back in my chair and helped
myself to a cigarette

  dont go too fast miss devry i
said quietly im not one of your fam-
ily kindly remember i did not tell
dr morton the young man was mur-
dered thoiigh possibly this was the case
i merely suggested it the thing is none
of my business and ive only a few frag-
ments of fact on which to build

  trot out your fragments then she
barked after all you did pretty well
with a few fragments in the cushing
case	

  i regarded her with frank amazement
how did you hear of the cushing
case miss devry it was never made
public it was one of the few private
cases i have ever handled and was
hushed up immediately my report was
turned in

  i hushed it up she said calmly
your report was turned in to my agent
cushing was general manager of the
sunbridge mills as you know they
form one of our sub-properties and
now if you think youve sparred suffi-
ciently for time to collect your thoughts
go ahead and answer my question and
dont lie

  i smoked for a deliberate moment re-
fusing to let her take command i have
a horror of snap judgments and ill-con-
sidered statements while i have no
more pride than the next man i do
after all have a reputation to sustain

i suppose you never heard of the
 white lotus society i then asked
not to my knowledge

  its one of the numerous chinese se-
cret societies-not in this country but
in china and malaya where it has been
suppressed it has an elaborate system
of signs and grips riot only for recogni-
tion but for general purposes the posi-


death on the doorstep

tion in which the body of mr devry
was found is known as the sign of
death

  im glad it has some meaning she
observed with a rather gruesome matter-
of-fact air other than the convulsions
of an alcoholic fool go on

  that position could not have been
due to chance i said unhurried chi-
nese in this country know nothing of
this society as a rule either he was
murdered and left lying there for some-
one like dr morton to see-someone
acquainted with such matters-or else
he was found dead by someone who
knew the sign arid who so arranged
him perhaps from some grimly fantastic
whimsy i take it he himself had no
knowledge of china

  he had no knowledge of anything
except his animal desires she said flat-
ly if-

she checked herself and looked up-
ward past me with such a glare of
ferocity that i turned instinctively thus
i had my first sight of loren andrey
he stood on the upper of the two steps
leading down into the room so that
he seemed gigantic in reality he was
no taller than i a fraction under six
feet he must have been a handsome
fellow naturally but now his face was
hot and dark as though flushed with
ill-temper black heavy brows bristled
above puffy eyes i judged him to be
in his early twenties he wore pajamas
and dressing-gown

  hello he said didnt know you
were here

  go on back to bed said miss dev-
ry in a tense menacing voice

  he turned and walked out of the
room then she spoke as though more
to herself than to me

  loren andrey is one of those things
that crawl out from- under a flat stone
and marry into the homes of the
wealthy ugh well-and now she
turned to me herself again-do you
actually think that nat died quietly
and that some waggish friend tied him
up like a pretzel

  i dont know what to think miss
devry the jester hardly waited around
until morning and i went on to tell
her how i had moved the arm from the
breast and how it had resumed its posi-
tion before the preliminary inquest at
this her black eyes fairly blazed with in-
terest and a keen intelligence for the
first time she seemed entirely human

   good bodham good she ex-
  claimed why should the arm have
  been replaced unless as you suggest-
  ed the position of the body was meant
  as a signal for someone in the morton
  household

   thats the point dr morton
  seemed startled by my impulsive words
  im to see him this evening

     she puffed at her cigarette i noticed
  the apparent fragility of her bony hands
  which in reality possessed astonishing
  strength she spoke abruptly

    if it was a sign it was meant for
  morton or that silly ass jessop his sec-
  retary what d you think

    i shrugged i dont know what to
  think why anyone should want to dis-
  turb either man with such a symbol is
  beyond me jessop i recall seemed
  startled when he saw the body    no-
  i had already moved the arm morton
  however would be more apt to have
  recognized the sign

    you seem rather honest bodham
  she jerked out regarding this posi-
  tion of the body-you think chance
  should be ruled out

    i cant assent thoughtlessly miss
  devry chance has too often served me
  well yet if youd read emerson you
  must realize that chance so-called fol-
  lows some immutable law of mathemati-
  cal sequence beyond our comprehension
  there are other factors-

    never mind throwing up a smoke-
  screen you simply dont want to com-
  mit yourself i dont blame you a par-
  ticle you say that this sign of death is
  not well known

    it might be known to any student of
  chinese symbolism but only if he had
  dipped into the lore of chinese secret so-
  cieties i suppose youre going to ask
  who might have done it no use miss
  devry i dont know i dont care i
  dont want to bother about it to me
  this is less important than my own
  work

    you may change your mind about
  that she barked you were about to
  mention other factors what are they

  ewing my chair i went over to the
  window a huge sheet of plate glass
  that filled the entire wall except for the
  entrance to the balcony below us to the
  left nestled pine springs like a childs
  toy village

    the winding indio highway hugged
  the southern foothills my eye followed
  it out toward the city limits at this


the blue book magazine

distance mortons adobe house and
walls blended with the desert sand but
my own white-painted cottage was dis-
tinct close to it was a tiny splotch of
red i knew bathsheba was at work on
the rose-bushes in her atrocious crim-
son slacks far on beyond past the city
limits lay the isle of araby night-spot

i beckoned to miss devry who rose
  spryly and joined me

  the young man i said left araby
over yonder and drove back toward
pine springs passing mortons house
on the way he took miss wong there
and i pointed toward the town on the
left when he left her he was appar-
ently all right had he been stricken
then he would probably have made
every effort to reach the nearest doctor
if he had come almost home here be-
fore feeling an attack he certainly
would have come in and telephoned dr
morton thus there is no apparent
reason why he should have driven out
to dr mortons house for medical atten-
tion do i make the point clear
quite suppose he drove out there
for some other reason she vented a
dry chuckle

  i gave her a look and she had the
grace to apologize in her own way

  never mind young man im talking
about nat not about miss morton
where could he have been going in that
direction otherwise

  i shrugged her question off since
the indio road leads into a transconti-
nental highway he might have been go-
ing to skaneateles for all i know or care
his family should know better than i
after all my interest is transient and
my knowledge scanty

  she took my arm and cackled out a
laugh of real amusement

  now youre huffing and puffing but
you shant blow my house down bod-
ham we know he didnt go back to
araby but did he go farther is there
any other night-spot in that direction
none i think there is of course
the kubla club five miles out-the
big swank gambling-place i rejoined
thoughtfully suppose he headed for
there that would explain it let us
say he came back here then started for
the kubla

  youre ahead of me she cut in
what makes you think he came back
here at all

  his clothes they were absolutely
fresh and new not a wrinkle in them

he was not at the araby all evening
in those clothes on a warm night danc-
ing and dining so he must have come
back here changed then started to visit
the kubla

  now im one ahead of you he did
not come back here at all

  how do you know i demanded
do you remember passing the little
porters lodge by the gate the only
way to get here a night guard sleeps
there the gates closed at night the
guard has told me that nat did not come
in all night

  i glanced at my watch good lord
its noon and past i must be off

  not yet she said calmly and looked
me in the eye you dont give a damn
for me and my money do you

  if you want to put it that way i
said and smiled to relieve the words

  youd be surprised to know how
much i like it too now bodham be
frank you can use money every man
can no matter how much he has plenty
in my own family would sell their own
souls to get more money so be frank
and dont hedge any further you be-
lieve that nats death involves both mys-
tery and what the detective stories caft
foul play

  ive no definite reason-

  dont hedge she broke in rea-
son or not you so believe if that should
be true i want to cover it up keep it
concealed have no publicity

  thats impossible if theres an au-
topsy and the death proves not natural

  then damn the publicity she al-
most screamed the words in a blaze
whoever killed that boy goes to the
chair by god worthless he may have
been but he bore the name of devry
and nobody murders a devry with im-
punity while im alive

  dont jump at conclusions i retort-
ed if it was murder let the police
handle it i dont want any-

again she cut me short and most
l astonishingly she came close to
me putting one hand on my arm in a
flash she had changed completely for
one moment i had the curious experi-
ence of sensing what this flaming woman
must have been in her youth as all her
undimmed spirit leaped out at me in
passionate appeal her voice was gen-
tle now incredibly gentle and tender

  bodham theres only one person in
this world whom i respect and love-
never mind who it is something youve


death on the doorstep

france

said makes me afraid for this person not
for myself i need help dreadfully not
police help but yours i know your
reputation i know what you can do
name your own fee make it large
what you like but help me help me
i was shaken by her sudden deep sin-
cerity and earnestness

  you really think that if this were
murder it might be repeated

  yes she said her black alive eyes
intent on me yes nat was not im-
portant enough to be hated by anyone
but others are important will you
help me

  i came to an abrupt decision very
well suppose you arrange for a private
autopsy at pretona immediately if it
sfrows death was not from natural causes
ill take the case

  she swung around stepped to the
desk and took up a house telephone

  send mr devry here immediately
she ordered

  she picked up a cigarette lit it and
had barely put down the match when
the somewhat futile and hesitant na-
thaniel iii appeared in the doorway

  nathaniel drive at once to pre-
tona see the undertaker or mortician
as theyre called nowadays who has
charge of the body give him a hun-
dred dollars tell him to have a doc-
tor perform an autopsy at once for me
and to bring the report here by tonight
sure ill pay the doctor of course its
imperative that you handle the matter-
but edna broke in devry his jaw
falling i- this is not necessary-
for gods sake stop blatting at me
she flung out you must go yourself
to give the necessary permission go
and have the spare car brought around
for mr bodham

devry left and she turned to me
ill let you know as soon as i get the
report remember its a promise you
made me anything else you want
yes i rejoined taking out pencil
and paper i dont like reticence

youve admitted a fear for certain rela-
tives whom you do love now if you
please give me the names of all the fam-
ily here-im a bit confused on this an-
drey person tell me every one whos
in this house except the servants

  an impish glee came into her eyes
then and there as i now know she re-
solved to withhold one or two secrets
from me at the moment i thought she
was merely enjoying her own bile for
she sketched every member of her im-
mediate family in pure vitriol

  nathaniel iii son of a rascally fa-
ther ineffective wishy-washy amounts
to nothing his wife viola is a nonen-
tity theyre a well-paired couple
their son nat is dead their daughter
frances you met on the way here she
married loren andrey shes like her
mother colorless and selfish and weak
loren andrey is handsome in a way but
devilish weak also-a goodly apple rot-
ten at the core as marlowe wrote

  shakespeare i corrected her

  she cackled gleefully wanted to see
if you were listening there are dis-
tant relatives no others close my sec-
retary peterson lives in the house of
course hes a sly fellow great ability
but uses what he gets from me to play
the market always wins too small
sums only so i say nothing it contents
him and hes actually of great value to
me works off his slyness in little
things and can be trusted in big things

this was a new sort of philosophy to
me but i did not argue the point
there was nothing more she could or
would tell me regarding the family so
i took my leave shook hands and went
out to the waiting car

  i was rolled home in great style but
scarcely appreciated the novelty this
confounded case had begun to grip me
i had let myself go into it a little with
miss devry and had fallen into her am-
bush now i found myself waylaid by
unwelcome mystery


the slue book magazine

  i resented this it threatened to in-
terfere seriously with my immediate am-
bitions i had to get my notes into shape
my book readied it was to serve as the
thesis for my ph d once i had that
degree i was in line for an excellent
position at a large eastern university-
i could even consider marriage so i
wanted no cases to investigate now

upon reaching home i kept nothing
back from bathsheba she has for
long had full charge of the family ex-
chequer now for the first time she con-
fided that our trip abroad and the
vagaries of the stock-market had played
the devil with our finances

  i havent wanted you to be troubled
tom she concluded you thought we
had plenty of money but money makes
its own home my good man let me
strongly urge that you become strictly
commercial take up miss devrys offer
and charge her plenty because our
funds really are getting low and when
i say low i mean l-o-w

  ill not put in my time on futile
mystery i compromised weakly if
an autopsy shows there was murder well
and good ill take the case let it go
at that going out this afternoon

 she was she and kathy morton
were bound for the tennis club to
watch the matches i had hoped to go
also tennis being my great obsession in
the world of sport and my sole exercise
but i had other things on hand now

  since recognizing devrys posture as
the white lotus sign of death i had
been eager to get at my notes now i
plunged into them and for three solid
hours worked over them the result
was failure i found absolutely nothing
having any bearing on this case

  doorstep or threshold-death at night
-death on the doorstep-i exhausted the
arcana of the white lotus seeking some
connection with this affair i found
only one thing but this was highly im-
portant the right hand should have
been clenched ort the heart when i
found the body the hand had been re-
laxed and open whoever had left the
body there had neglected to clench that
hand

  the deduction was clear devrys
body had been arranged by someone
who knew the sign of death inexactly
probably at secondhand this imme-
diately ruled out any chinese source

  i was still at this task when bath-
sheba summoned me to a cold supper

which i abominate however she was
in a gale of high spirits combined with
a certain triumphant tenseness which i
have long learned to associate with some
exultant inner knowledge she was
about to tell me something and strange
as it may appear this pretty butterfly
sister of mine had often turned up some
surprisingly valuable bit of information

  now darling she began just draw
up your bib and pull down your tucker
and dont make faces at the food its
cold but its good when you hear what
ive found out you may be glad that i
wasnt slaving in the kitchen all after-
noon

  i waited with resignation bathshe-
bas method of imparting her knowledge
is rather exasperating she rattled on
about the tennis matches while i ate
and by the time i lit a cigarette over my
coffee she was telling how she and
kathy had separated after the matches
to do some errands agreeing to meet at
the post office since pine springs has
no postmen the inhabitants call twice a
day at the post office for their mail

  and after i ordered the groceries i
dropped in at the bamboo bar for a
cocktail who do you think i saw sit-
ting there in a dark corner

  mussolini i ventured dumping my
ashes

  tom dont use your saucer for
ashes heres an ash-tray guess again
who

  only mussolini would justify your
build-up bashy ill bite who
jessop she intoned dramatically

  i laughed oh so the secondhand
jessop is a secret drinker eh

  he was not drinking bathsheba
loosed her bomb he was carrying the
torch i could feel the flames the length
of the bar and you could have picked
me up with a whisk-broom think of
jessop having a girl friend why it
just isnt possible

  my dear bathsheba i said kindly
although ive been a good brother to
you for years its evident i havent been
a good mother the facts of life are still
hidden from you believe me although
jessop may be secretary to a chinese
scholar spray his throat before retiring
and look like a startled frog there may
still bum deep down inside a flame per-
haps less pure than hot at such times
its not ladylike for you to-

  but tom im serious she ex-
claimed when such a man as that
drags a girl-i didnt know her inciden-
death on the doorstep

tally-into a bar for cocktails when he
should be browsing over his typewriter
it deserves investigation

   so does dr morton with whom i
 have a date i said glancing at my
 watch much to her dismayed disgust
 i walked out on her protests

   i dressed carefully and not for dr
 mortons benefit either and started out
 i was at the gate when bathsheba sum-
 moned me back to answer the telephone
 miss devry was on the wire

   mr bodham i must see you at
 once she commanded

   sorry i rejoined its impossible
 i have an engagement with dr morton
 would the morning do as well

    yes ill send the car for you at eight
 will that suit you

   ill drive myself hanks whats up
 you havent had any report yet

   yes i have she barked and i
 hold you to your promise you were
 right about that investment the stock
 was very badly watered

upon this she hung up abruptly

the meaning of this enigma struck
me like a blow she had been too cau-
tious to speak plainly over the phone
 of course she held me to my promise
therefore the autopsy had revealed mur-
der the stock very badly watered   
why of course impossible as such
 a thing was in the desert nathaniel dev-
ry iv had been drowned

chapter four

 when kathy morton opened the
 door i kissed her it was just one
 of those things

   what the consequences would have
 been had not dr morton opened his
 study door at that moment must remain
 in doubt i was thunderstruck at my
 own audacity such a thing had never
 before happened-at least where kathy
 was concerned my confusion at the old
 doctors appearance quite prevented me
 from noting her reaction however mor-
 ton had seen nothing

   come in bodham come in he ex-
 claimed with energy i was expecting
 you

   he was puffing furiously at one of the
 thin brown paper cigarettes he was con-
 stantly rolling i entered the study he
 banged the door shut after me and
 waved me to a chair then he began a
 nervous pacing up and down past his
 long fiat-topped table-desk

  i was rather unhappy over the news i
bore he had certified to natural death
in a case of murder i reflected that it
would upset him terribly and shrank
from informing him	

dodham he began over and
lj above my acute dismay at the dis-
covery of that poor lad dead at my door
the other morning i was troubled by
something that eluded me not until
you spoke to me this morning did i be-
come conscious of what it was-that
damnable symbol

  then you didnt recognize it

  no and now i dont see how i
failed to perceive its significance he
dropped wearily into a chair and pressed
his cigarette into an ash-tray and i
have-i have the feeling that i may
have made a ghastly error bodham
was my diagnosis correct after all ive
almost determined to go to the police
with this the other matters were not
so important but this-this means the
threat- his voice trailed off into si-
lence

  what other matters i asked if
youve been threatened-

  no no you misunderstood my
words he broke in

  i had not misunderstood them how-
ever since he had broken the ice him-
self i determined to speak

  you were right in suspecting an error
in your diagnosis morton the boy was
killed

  his head jerked up how do you

know

  i briefly ran over events since the in-
quest concluding with miss devrys
message about the post-mortem he sat
silent as though overwhelmed by what
i said then he began to roll another of
his brown-paper cigarettes

  im really glad that youve brought
all this to a focal point he said slowly
do you think it will become public
yes murder is a crime against the
state if this turns out to be murder as
i assume it will then itll be a scandal-
sheet holiday dont worry about your
mistaken diagnosis dr gregg a skilled
police surgeon did not doubt you were
right no one would think of tapping
the lungs in such an examination here
in the desert and drowning leaves no
exterior evidence after the suffused-
he cut me short drowning do
you realize what youre saying drown-
ing here in the desert-yes its con-
ceivable he might have drowned acci-


the blue book magazine

dentally in a swimming-pool    but his
clothes were dry bodham

  more i added thinking aloud
they had not been immersed they
were brand-new and fresh they cer-
tainly had not been worn all evening
if he went home and changed into them
then he did not drown in a swimming-
ool if he drowned first he would not
ave gone home and changed

xoure being led into fantastic and
i absurd realms he cut in with ab-
rupt decision utterly absurd bodham
if youll pardon me do you know the
real meaning of the sign of death as
used by chinese criminal societies
that the dead person had been assas-
sinated by the society

  not in the least he said bleakly
or very rarely its a warning of death
to come

 i smiled you mean one corpse
would be a warning that another corpse
was coming

  certainly not the mere suggestion
shows to what fantastic lengths youve
gone he said with an unwonted asper-
ity either a lay figure was used or a
painted figure of a man in that position
the doll or painting was sent the pros-
pective victim as warning of death to
follow

  i was forced to accept his dictum
after all the singapore authorities had
not covered these secret signs with too
great exactitude also the sign as used
in malaya might well fail to correspond
with the same sign as used in china

  do you mean i asked that you
think this secret society is threatening
you

  that would be utterly fantastic he
said and sighed i dont know what
to think kathy might be the one threat-
ened

  and that i retorted is more utter-
ly fantastic than any fool proposition i
might make come morton i believe
youre evading me youve already men-
tioned other matters and threats grant-
ed that what you say is possible that you
might be threatened-dont you think
you should confide in me and help me
to protect you after all doctor i
think a great deal of you and of kathy
whose happiness is involved

  i believe you do my boy he said
gently and regarded me with that in-
effable saintly smile which expressed
such tenderness and beauty of spirit
and im glad you do yes i confess

frankly that im evading you and shall
continue to keep my own counsel unless
forced to speak i know nothing that
would help solve the mystery of devrys
death believe me i have no more idea
than you who killed him yet it was
probable that the sign of death the
warning was meant f or me

  i could not fathom this paradox i
ran my eye around the room books
and papers were heaped everywhere but
in exceedingly orderly fashion on the
book-shelves were priceless chinese por-
celains and bronzes against one wall
was a case filled with manuscripts neat
rolls fastened with ivory pins morton
followed my gaze and my thoughts as
well for he shook his head slowly

  no bodham theres nothing here
to justify such a warning he said with
finality

  so you refuse to trust me i said
bluntly if youre afraid of anything
i went on why not move jessop into
the house you have plenty of room
here

  he broke into a little laugh jes-
sops an old woman bodham andreas
the filipino houseboy sleeps in th
room just off the kitchen but hes no
use in a pinch

  didnt jessop at the inquest men-
tion some chap who does typing for
you

  frank thompson yes a good boy
graduated from college last year and has
a job here does my typing of nights
ambitious hard-working young fellow
known him for years

  then why not get him here give
him a room and youll have a guard
right in the house ill lend you a gun
no permit will be needed for that pre-
caution this way kathyd be spared
any alarm too

  not bad not bad he agreed with a
nod and reached for the telephone

thompson i gathered required lit-
tle urging he promised to be there
in ten minutes with his bag and dr
morton hung up with evident satisfaction

  splendid suggestion bodham i ad-
mit it relieves my mind suppose we
have a glass of sherry-eh a little ear-
lier than my usual libation but kathy
wont object since youre sharing it
shell join us in fact

  he went to the door and called her
name i spoke swiftly

  before she comes tell me quickly-
have your researches brought out any-
death on the doorstep

thing in the background of the devry
family itself that might account for the
death of young devry

  he stared at me row as he had that
morning when i mentioned the sign
of death

  what-what on earth gave you that
idea bodham

  come doctor im tired of evasions

i	said impatiently you know the ap-
palling record of crimes due to family
hatred on the surface the devry fam-
ily would seem fertile ground for seeds
of violence the old dowager treats the
others with contempt and dislike and
theyre not a lovely crowd by a long
shot youre working on a period that
covers the activities of the original dev-
ry in china arent you

  yes yes he murmured abstractedly
you know i was in china myself for
many years as a physician no bod-
ham no theres no such incident as you
seem to suspect nothing worse than
can be told of any great mercantile fam-
ily nothing to be remotely connected
with the death of this young nathaniel
devry

  theres no reason to suspect that he
was killed by the white lotus people in
revenge for some ancient injury done
them by a devry

  no none whatever he seemed un-
easy and anxious to my eye

  very well then thats out doctor
we must assume that the sign was
meant for you i suppose arent you
going to reconsider your decision about
trusting me

  he turned to me with a pathetically
bewildered air backed by grave dignity

  believe me bodham i  should like
to do so yet im not sure-not sure
there are so many queer things unbe-
lievable things he seemed to be talk-
ing as much to himself as to me the
letter with the stamp that was never
issued-the antique bronze coin-no
bodham i implore you dont press me
not now not now i may decide to con-
fide in you but-

  im not trying to worry you doctor
but to get help in this affair i said qui-
etly let decision wait by all means
have you any family tree of the house
of devry i havent read up on the
clan and find it difficult to establish the
old lady how does she come to head
the family while the nathaniels are
running around footloose

  at this his eyes lit up he produced
from his huge fiat-topped desk a neatly

inked genealogical chart and spread it
out for me his long delicate forefinger
traced the emergence of edna devry as
he talked

  one of the most remarkable women
alive bodham a combination of semir-
amis hetty green and cleopatra-in
their purely constructive angles you un-
derstand her father the original na-
thaniel devry was born in  he
went out to china at fifteen as an ap-
prentice writer or clerk and before he
was thirty he had a fleet of clipper ships
in the tea and silk trade but never
mind all that

  his finger traced the lines paused

  here he married in  he was
then fifty-two edna devry your old
dowager was born the following year
on march fourth to celebrate the fact
devry sent to the incoming president
abraham lincoln who was inaugurated
on that day a magnificent ivory chest
filled with fine teas and rolls of silk

he glowed with the enthusiasm of
the research scholar as he detailed
the story of the devry empire in a
day when women were not supposed to
dabble in business edna devry had de-
voted herself utterly to this empire i
gathered that a love-affair had gone
wrong or something of the sort for mor-
ton was vague about some things how-
ever she was evidently the only child
of the original nathaniel devry who had
much gumption one sister had died
another had married a man who took
the name of devry-he became nathan-
iel ii a brother had existed but from
the dates on the chart i took for grant-
ed that he had died as a young man

  the first devry had died nathaniel

ii	took over-and according to dr mor-
ton edna fought him until he died
suddenly the whole inheritance had
been split up she beginning with her
own share built anew to restore the
unity of the whole as morton put it
she gripped and gripped with claws of


the blue book magazine

steel until across the years she had
drawn back all the severed portions

  and now today she has everything
in her own hands he concluded she
is the house of devry the others have
absolutely nothing newspapers mills
ships real property-everything is hers
alone

  i concluded that morton was mistak-
en in this but let it wait until some
points about that family tree were
cleared up i had started to question
him about certain things that drew my
attention when the door-bell began to
ring it rang again and again accom-
panied by an angry bang-bang as though
someone were kicking at the front door

  morton straightened up kathy
he called sharply at the open door into
the hall andreas no its his night
off kathy for heavens sake answer
the bell child

  there was no response no sound of
footsteps came from the hall sudden-
ly i realized that kathy had not an-
swered the previous call when morton
had spoken of a glass of sherry

  she must have gone out i said
permit me doctor ill answer the
door

  i went out to the front door and
swung it open hearing an imperative
call from outside as i did so a man
stood there in his arms with blood
streaming from her head was kathy

chapter five

the man at the door was the typist
frank thompson i-i found her
outside he stammered excitedly

  i took kathys senseless body from
him and carried her to the study dr
morton had appeared calmly quietly
with a dreadful stillness he directed me
into a room beyond which had been his
consultation-room in earlier days

  here i placed kathy on a leather
couch perceived that the blood came
from a wound above the right ear and
then was pushed aside dr morton took
charge with a cool poise and deft skill
eloquent of the inner man giving me
and thompson curt directions we
brought all he required and stood by
while he cleansed the wound and dressed
it pausing now and again to use his
stethoscope the hurt was a cut suffi-
cient to bring blood in quantities but
i was thankful to see a swelling which
roughly indicated there was no fracture

    cant be certain morton said to
  our questions examining the hurt with
  his delicate fingers thompson will
  you have the kindness to telephone dr
  gregg and ask him to get here immedi-
  ately the telephones in the hall
  thompson disappeared

    why do you want gregg i de-
  manded anything alarming in her
  condition

    no he said on the safe side-
  professional habit

  his poise was beginning to shatter
  the shock had hit him terrifically
  he lowered himself into a chair and sat
  holding kathys wrist fingers on pulse
  eyes gripped to her face with frantic
  tensity his lips were moving and dis-
  jointed words little more than gasp-
  ing whispers came from him

    singleton the dastardly scoundrel-
  threats-would he harm her then-
  his voice trailed away but those
  words left me in the icy grip of conjec-
  ture i sat motionless thankful that
  he had forgotten my presence

    until now i had taken for granted
  that kathy had suffered some accident
  his words hinted at far more especially
  when coupled with his fears that the
  sign of death was meant as a warning
  some man named singleton then

    the old man knows-definitely i
  must make him tell me i thought
  in swift alarm thompson came in at
  this instant with word that gregg had
  been located in the movie theater and
  would be right out i stood up

    come along thompson outside
  show me where you found her

    as we passed through the study i
  snatched up a flashlight from the doc-
  tors big desk and thompson accompa-
  nied me outside my first thought was
  to ask in what position he had found
  her he dispelled any significance with a
  word she had been in a crumpled
  heap face down there was no sign of
  death here thank heaven

    he showed me the spot on the path
  around the corner of the house as he
  came up the front walk he had seen her
  lying in a patch of moonlight he had
  seen no one else no figure moving
  among the oleanders and shrubs close-
  ly clipped rye grass covered the ground
  neither this nor the graveled path re-
  vealed anything at all to my beam of
  light the path ran closely along the
  side of the house a few feet distant
  toward the wall of the grounds was a
  
death on the doorstep

large clump of dwarf bamboos as the
ray swept their base something was re-
vealed

  this was a small pot of glazed pot-
tery containing a box plant lying on
the ground i examined it and found it
cracked badly but not broken the
plant was partly pulled out of its sur-
rounding earth i found it loose but
held in the pot by a mass of roots
caught by the plant stem and swung it
would have been a deadly weapon

  look-look exclaimed thompson
theres where the pot came from

  in the wall about three feet from the
ground was a small arched embrasure
another beyond the study window con-
tained a similar potted plant this one
was empty bringing the fallen pot to
it i found that the pot fitted exactly in-
to the circular ring of dust in the niche
so much for that ten feet along the
wall was the second window of the doc-
tors study i walked down to it found
it open and verified the fact that these
two windows opened from the study
conscious that it was a crime and no ac-
cident i realized that with only wire
screens and venetian blinds to interfere
anyone standing here could have heard
every word uttered by morton and me

  this instantly shed light upon the
happening kathy had been outside the
house-for whatever reason-had seen
someone standing beside the window
here-the spot was in moonlight and up-
on investigating the intruder she had
been struck down the springy grass
close to the wall revealed nothing

  it was safe to assume that whoever
had stood by the wall had pressed close-
ly against the adobe bricks so i turned
my ray on the edge of the wall beside
the window the adobe was friable and
scratched easily revealing a deeper col-
or beneath the gray top surface almost
at once the ray picked up two deep
scratches waist high as though made
by a person turning hastily from his
eavesdropping

  swift exultation seized me here was
visual evidence of the criminal who had
twice struck at the same point and it
restored my confidence here was some-
thing for me to do with at last

a car came roaring up halting out-
side i turned to thompson

  theres gregg bring him inside
will you then run across the street
to my house like a good chap and
fetch my sister tell ier whats hap-

pened and ask her to come over at
once

  thompson departed i lit a cigarette
and settled down with my back against
the wall my first shock and anxiety
for kathy had been dissipated by the
knowledge that she was not seriously in-
jured the important thing now was
to unearth her assailant and to lose no
time about it i meant to have the truth
out of morton about singleton and the
threats meantime granting that this
assault was linked up with the murder of
young devry i had best get about my
own business which meant checking
over the few known facts

young devry had been drowned ei-
ther by accident or by design im-
probable yet true he was left on mor-
tons doorstep wearing fresh clothes
whence had they come he was not
drowned in those clothes assuredly

  fresh clothes fresh rope-soled san-
dals practically unworn the car de-
void of any clue-was it too late now to
search for fingerprints if it had been
murder i might assume the killer far
too clever to leave fingerprints since
such a carefully thought-out crime
planned to look like natural death
argued no fool behind it the motive
of the killing must have been far more
than a mere desire to threaten morton

  that mercedes car stuck in my mind
i thought back to the blob of mud un-
der the wheel on the floor good lord
mud that in itself was practically im-
possible in pine springs everything
here was desert sand even garden soil
as i knew to my cost had to be brought
from elsewhere

 mud then and a most important
clue there had been no mud on dev-
rys rope-soled sandals i had a clear
mental photograph of the body as it lay
there no mud on the sandals there-
fore the car had been driven here by the
murderer not by devry-probably driv-
en direct from the scene of the murder
for we must assume murder

  singleton name him so in default
of a better until i got the truth out of
dr morton he was someone who
knew what the sign of death would sig-
nify to morton searching for a person
who had this knowledge would be ab-
surd anyone might have it-jessop from
his secretarial work-or rose wong

  but one thing did seem logical-that
the murderer had returned here tonight
to listen at mortons window he must
the blue book magazine

have known therefore of my appoint-
ment with morton

  suddenly i recalled edna devrys
oblique way of telling about the post-
mortem as though fearing to be over-
heard perhaps by members of her own
household a possibility therel had
loren andrey or some other member of
that household been listening and heard
me tell her of the appointment

  or jessop it was not hard to pic-
ture him slinking along the path from
his quarters in the rear and pausing to
eavesdrop i must find out where he
had been this evening with his spare
stooped form his ridiculous small head
and birdlike ways he fitted in as an
eavesdropper perhaps but not as a
murderer i was reluctantly forced to ad-
mit

  with a sigh at the conflicting reflec-
tions i came to my feet using the
flashlight i examined the scratches in
the corner brick by the window

  they seemed to have been made by
the sidewise pull of something with two
pronounced protuberances the adobe
between the two heavy scratches was
also lightly scraped some one object
had evidently made this mark

  i placed myself against the wall the
mark was waist-high there was the
answer-a belt-buckle not jessops for
i was much taller than he no ordi-
nary belt-buckle either into my mind
flashed a mental picture of the belts so
commonly affected by the pine springs
dude cowboys the ornate silver-
bossed belts of imitation or real indian
make such a buckle with its silver or
turquoise studs had made this mark
not easy to trace of course but the
buckle would keep microscopic adobe
evidence of having made this scratch

somewhat cheered by this definite
clue i walked to the rear of the
grounds my light showed a frame struc-
ture the abode of jessop it was quite
dark and my knock brought no re-
sponse the door was locked to my
hand and this was a trifle surprising
crime being a rarity in pine springs
doors are seldom or never locked

  reflecting that a look around the
quarters of the repulsive little jessop
might well reveal some curious things i
turned away and hurried back to thd
front of the house bathshebas voice
had reached me from the road i found
her coming up the walk with thompson
and we passed into the house together

  from the smiles with which morton
and gregg welcomed us i knew all was
well with kathy

  shes just come around the wound
is superficial and shell be fit as a fiddle
in the morning dr morton said rath-
er optimistically  good evening miss
bodham i know kathy will be glad to
see you shes in her room ah thomp-
son come along my boy and ill in-
stall you back in a moment gregg

i turned to the local physician
did kathy know who or what hit
her gregg

  he nodded she heard something
went outside saw a mans figure around
at the side she called out next thing
she knew he was rushing at her she
doesnt know what hit her-he must
have acted quickly no description ex-
cept a hat pulled over his face a stran-
ger quite tall morton doesnt want me
to get the police in ill treat it as an
accident eh

  i assented and told him what the
weapon had been he whistled softly

  apparently a bungling job a glanc-
ing blow with such a weapon in the
right hands mr bodham wed have a
hospital case at least well dont hesi-
tate to phone me if any complications
ensue though i dont think they will
he departed morton joining us and
seeing him to the door thompson
who had left his car at the gate went
after his bag morton and i retired to
the study and the old physician pro-
duced glasses and decanter of brandy

  you were looking around outside
he asked i nodded and told of my
findings and by the way i added
wheres your secretary this evening
jessop oh on andreas night off
jessop goes into town for dinner and
takes in a movie kathy and i snack
alone jessop should be back by this
time poor old fellow hell be sick over
this he adores kathy hes been with
me since she was six or seven years old
thompson having brought in his bag
came into the study and stood staring
at us he was a square-cut young man
a good clean type nothing ornate

  i never think of things at the right
time he observed bumblingly ill
bet a dollar i saw the car that fellow
drove away in

  what fellow i demanded 
the one who hit miss morton as
i was on my way here by the turn of the
road leading out from town nat dev-


death on the doorstep

rys mercedes passed me going for town
like hell

   i regarded him skeptically devrys
car i knew had been detained by the
police at the plaza garage until the in-
quest should be over was probably still
there

   youre a remarkable person thomp-
son i said dryly if you can tell any-
thing about an approaching car at night
that is unless its headlights were out
and yours were on

   his were on all right mr bodham
i knew it by the cut-out and got a flash
of the car as it passed me devry had a
cut-out on his exhaust and damn the
cops this mercedes has a peculiar deep
throaty roar id know it anywhere

 having resolved to corner morton
here and now i seized the opportunity
to get rid of thompson besides he
might get information of value

  your news may be important i
said i wish youd do something for
us drive in to the plaza garage now
and see if the mercedes is there if it
is see whether anyone took it out to-
night do you mind

  far from it he was delighted and
departed promptly dr morton re-
garded me frowningly

  even if it were the mercedes he
commented logically need it have
been driven by the man who hit kathy
or has the car some significance that i
dont know

 your argument is right i admitted
 i wanted to get thompson away so i
 could ask you a few questions doctor
 he stirred uneasily before he could
 voice any protest i hurried on

   what you saitl earlier this evening
 and your mutterings about threats and
 someone named slingleton i let drive
 inexorably make me positive that you
 know more than youve told me have
 you any idea who might have been lis-
 tening at this window tonight

   of course not he began its as
mysterious to me as it is-

 then i not only urge but demand
that you give me all the information
possible i cut in if the position of
devrys body was meant as a warning
as you say it was then i must know the
whole thing for example-whos sin-
gleton

  for a long moment he stared at me
at last a sigh broke from him and he
came to his feet

 bodham i dont know who single-
ton is he said in a helpless and infi-
nitely pathetic way he went to a lit-
tle cannonball safe in the far comer of
the study pulled open the door and
came back with a small tin dispatch-box
he placed it on the desk and sat down
wearily

  i dont know im not even certain
that he has anything to do with these
terrible things i muttered the name
yes for the past five years the fear of
singleton has grown and increased in
my heart just as his diabolic brain in-
tended

  with a key worn on his watch-chain
he opened the tin dispatch-box

xouve never seen the man you
i dont know who he is i asked in-
credulously

 no he has communicated with me
only by letter or telephone i have his
letters here and memoranda of the tele-
phone conversations except for the first
few

  do you mean sir i asked sympa-
thetically that-well blackmail

  he paused and pursed up his lips

  if so its the most curious sort of
blackmail i ever heard of bodham as
you know im devoting the last years of
my life to finishing my economic amer-
ica in china the field is tremendous
ive already issued two volumes jessop
and i are now completing the third and
fourth and therell be three to come a
detailed survey of american business
enterprise in china from the earliest
days of the tea trade is more compre-


the blue book magazine

hensive a subject than most people
would recognize

  this singleton he went on in his
gentle way is a scholar of no mean
ability he has sent me invaluable in-
formation for the book also he sends
me another sort of information insisting
that i incorporate it i cannot possibly
do so after all my work is an economic
survey not a compendium of muck-
raking

  oh i exclaimed he wants you to
publish scandalous information is the
stuff true

  yes-to both questions morton re-
joined whoever singleton is he has
amazing sources of information i have
gone to considerable trouble to verify
some of his statements more the man
is a scholar his very threats are aston-
ishing things

  one minute please i intervened
does this scandalous information have
any one focal point or is it general-
aimed at american business methods in
the orient

  all of it said morton drawing a
deep breath concerns the devry family
this was a facer then could he be
one of the family

  not at all in my opinion morton
said so positively that i tried a fresh
tack

  threats eh what can he threaten
you with

  everything imaginable from lawsuits
to physical violence at first i took it all
seriously later as year after year noth-
ing happened i put him down as a
crank and tried to forget him if i-
wait please i exclaimed swiftly
this very fact doctor may be of the
greatest importance in revealing his
identity are you sure none of single-
tons threats materialized

  absolutely none at least until recent-
ly his communications are irregular
sometimes nothing comes for six months
sometimes several come at once always
the same insistence always some threat
usually a vaguely hinted and indefinite
threat couched in some curious fashion
they are all here-you may inspect
them for yourself i believe your appeal
was well founded and i shall tell you
all i know

he handed me the tin box as he spoke
and i glanced through it here were
typed sheets and photostats documents
engravings legal papers a little packet
of letters

  only recently you say i glanced
up sharply then one threat did bear
fruit

  i fear so he took a folded paper
from a desk drawer i had been study-
ing this only today the envelope is lost
it came two days after my last telephone
talk with singleton it speaks for itself
though i am frankly puzzled by the
coin

 the folded paper when opened
showed a large bronze antique coin
glued in the center it was otherwise
quite blank with it was a slip of paper
with a line of typing

  death will be laid on your doorstep

morton leaned over and took a
letter from the top of the pile in
the dispatch box

  this had come just previously-i
think a week before it was posted at
new orleans as youll note in septem-
ber it came then the telephone call
then this note with the coin-and last
the murder of devry

  devry was hardly murdered merely
to serve as a warning i said	

  morton touched the letter in my hand
he had a vague bewildered air	

  i dont know bodham look at this
letter sent through the mail with a
stamp that was never issued as though
the man were impressing me with his
infernal ability in every way it threatens
me with death unless my fourth volume
shall contain the material he wants pub-
lished  i wont do it nothing shall
make me do it

  his voice died off into helpless per-
plexity i laid aside the letter he indi-
cated whose stamp meant nothing to
me and the paper on which the coin
was glued then morton went on again
that devil seemed to know all about
my work right from the start he knew
i was not including his material in my
second volume or in my third he in-
sisted that it be included in my fourth
on which i am now working he threat-
ened me with death before november
first unless it were so included novem-
ber is only three weeks away you see
this time he means business

  again he forgot me and rolled a ciga-
rette with uncertain fingers i glanced at
the little packet of lett ers which were in
their envelopes curiously they had
come from all over the world a singular
thing caught my eye and i looked more
closely three had come from cairo
from oslo in norway and from buenos


death on the doorstep

aires the postmarks were respectively
dated september th september rd
and september th-all  i looked
at them again greatly astonished that
they could have been posted by the
same person was impossible yet they
were all addressed in the same typescript

  others of the letters several of them
had come from shanghai or peiping dur-
ing the year  it was only by a
happy chance that i noted these things
for i made no careful examination of
the letters at the moment

  among the other papers were several
antiquated receipts for opium from the
factory at maao each bore the english
notation bill as molasses  and signed
with the flourished initials n d ii
opium-running eh i commented
the usual dynasty of wealth doesnt
run to seed until the third or fourth
generation

  truemorton agreed dully the
moral fabric of the house of devry
seems to have disintegrated early

  if you dont mind doctor id like
to take this coin the letter last arrived
and two or three of the other letters
home-to study over tonight i said

  if you like of course he rejoined i
picked out what i wanted and pocketed
them take the whole box he added

  not now safer with you perhaps
i said tomorrow ill give the after-
noon to a careful examination of the
box and everything in it is there any
more you can add to the evidence i
gather from my cursory survey that
nathaniel ii who must have been miss
devrys brother was an unscrupulous
rascal some crank named singleton
knows a lot about it and wants the world
to know the details eh

dr morton sucked at his cigarette
thoughtfully as though not entire-
ly agreeing with me

  unscrupulous but powerful a very
strong man he said not a petty
rascal he died i remember shortly
after the first nathaniel passed away
tell me this i asked what does
your instinct tell you this man singleton
is after instinct your sixth sense do
you honestly think hes taking such work
and trouble merely to force publication
of forgotten scandals it must be a
means to some end rather instinct
morton whats this motive

  recognition he promptly replied
yes thats the word i hadnt thought
of it before as a motive then his face

  fell therefore singleton cant be this
murderer bodham it doesnt tie in
with his character as i see it hes a
disappointed and frustrated scholar who
hasnt been able to get his own work
published there are many like him
he has never carried out any threats
before this so this cant be his work

  shook my head at this

  wishful and faulty thinking dr
morton i must disagree with you it is
quite logical that he has come to want
publication so insanely with such terrific
tension as he sees the chances slipping
that now he wouldnt stop at murder
have you any means of communicating
with singleton

  none unless he makes contact with
me by telephone

  when did he last telephone you
three weeks or so ago just after the
arrival of the letter from new orleans
threatening death i told him point-
blank that i could not and would not
publish these abhorrent things in my
work he rang off abruptly i afterward
found that the call had come from a
public booth in indio and realization of
his nearness sent a chill through me
later came the coin and its accompany-
ing threat

  i	picked up the typed slip death
will be laid on your doorstep now the
meaning of the warning struck home

  your words prove my point i said
slowly your absolute refusal drove him
to desperation now he sees the op-
portunities fast fading as your volumes
approach completion former threats
were not carried out but this time our
frustrated friend comes to grips with
himself and does carry out the threat
morton refused to admit my argu-
ment no bodham no the letters
have been full of demands for recogni-
tion he wants public credit for his work

i	must admit that the material he sup-
plied would cause a sensation if pub-
lished he seems to want it known that
john singleton is striking at the devry
family therefore even with hatred as a
motive it isnt logical that he should
murder one of that family merely to
impress me

  the old man seemed trying to con-
vince himself i did not care to argue
further nor was there any opportunity
the telephone rang thompson was
phoning from downtown and wanted me

  the mercedes was at the garage mr
bodham the night man said it hadnt


the blue book magazine

been taken out but i felt the hood and
it was hot he got mad and said it was
none of my business and to get the hell
out of there what shall i do now
come back and keep an eye on things
here tonight thanks very much
morton scarcely heard my report
bodham id like to go into every-
thing with you he said slowly a shadow
deepening in his eyes tonight im
too weary to do it let us say tomor-
row afternoon or evening

very well its a date i said sympa-
thetically touched by the wistful pathos
of his fine features ah heres bashyl
bathsheba walked in the clock was
just striking ten i asked after kathy

  oh shes quite herself tom and she
wants to see you go right in

  by all means morton added smil-
ing tell her ill be in shortly to say
good night

as i entered kathys room i felt sud-
l denly shaken in a wave of sicken-
ing apprehension i realized how differ-
ent all this scene how different the entire
world would now be had the assailants
blow been a trifle harder

  so strongly did this feeling overcome
me that as i reached the bed i found
myself dropping on my knees beside it
with my arms about kathys shoulders

  we said nothing in this moment of
silence yet we left nothing unsaid

  presently i drew back a little tremu-
lous half laughing half shaken by emo-
tion kathy held me against her touched
her lips to mine and spoke softly

  tom you silly goose there are tears
on your face im all right really

  i know but it hit me like a blow-
to think of what might have been-
well its not so forget it not that
i want to forget it myself its taken a
long time to get you where you are now
tom-where we both are

  ive only known you a couple of
months i said fumblingly i didnt
know youd feel the same way i do that
you could be sure about it

  she laughed a little joyously

  what do you take me for a mid-
victorian angel who needs a diagram
and blueprints to know what love is
anyhow you havent said the conven-
tional thing my dear and id love to
hear you say it

i neglected none of the conventions
hearing bathshebas voice uplifted
more shrilly than usual i recognized the
signal and departed upon a last kiss

  regaining the study i was abruptly
called to the immediate environment by
finding jessop here he had just come
in with a brief-case under his arm and
goggled at us in agitated excitement

  i hope shes not badly hurt dr mor-
ton he exclaimed there was no
fracture who did it

  we dont know that no shes not
much hurt jessop said morton and
smiled at me he must have guessed
why i had been detained i like to think
that he did guess are you just back
from town

  i came back a jew minutes ago sir
jessop replied good evening miss
bodham-mr bodham excuse me ill
get a drink of milk

  ducking his head to bathsheba he
passed us and departed to the kitchen
into my mind came a thought that made
me smile a sentence from one of the
letters of maurice de guerin can any-
one mention a man who has committed
a bloody crime after drinking a bowl of
milk

  come bashy its getting late i said
and we departed

  from the hall i glanced back dr
morton was standing beaming after jis
the dispatch-box in his hand i never
again saw the contents of that box and
it was my last glimpse of dr morton in
this life

          chapter six

   once home i dived into my study
   and laid my booty under the table
   lamp-the letters the coin glued to its
   paper nothing was written on the pa-
   per the coin seemed greek or roman
   showing a mans head i could make
   nothing whatever of it and so laid it
   aside and took up the letter bearing the
   stamp that was never issued as morton
   had termed it

     this also puzzled me it was the
   michigan centenary stamp issued in
    the seal of michigan in the center
   was blue the rest of the stamp was
   purple it looked quite ordinary to me
   however i know absolutely nothing of
   numismatics or philately i opened the
   door and called to bathsheba

     bashy will you be good enough to
   try and get hold of lincoln long dis-
   tance the naval base number is writ-
   ten on the pad by the phone

     my elder brother lincoln is a full
lieutenant in the navy he commanded

death on the doorstep

a destroyer now at san diego one of the
old world war destroyers being recondi-
tioned for use because of the european
conflict and its possibilities we had
been down at san diego two weeks
previously to have a visit with him and
his help might avail me now

  lincoln had no sympathy whatever
with my chosen field of work but at
coins and stamps he is a genius with
large collections of each and an amazing
knowledge of them knowing that he
could assuredly enlighten me on these
heads i turned to the letters themselves
while waiting

  the definitely threatening letter with
the supposedly unissued stamp was a
mere note it was typed and unsigned
like all of these communications and i
did not need to refer to any typewriter
classifications to see that the machine
was one of the old hammonds with inter-
changeable type-rolls this note read

    you have until nov st to include
  material in your volume iv will tele-
  phone you soon unless i have your
  assurance of compliance i will strike
  and my stroke means death this time
  the threat is positive and my intention
  definite i will endure no further re-
   fusals look for precise details on ex-
  terior of letter

  i looked over the paper and envelope
for said details and found nothing ex-
cept that the letter had been canceled in
new orleans late in september

  below the note were drawn with pen
and ink ten little figures of soldiers
each had the right leg extended in an
exaggerated goose-step beneath these
were typed the words this month must
be first again nothing else i held the
sheet to the light an ordinary letter
sheet of good quality bond paper

  the reference to details and the
marching figures were cryptic there
were no details what the figures
meant i could not see i was frown-
ing over this when bathsheba called to
me that lincoln was on the line

  i had intended describing the stamp
and coin to him but before i could
broach the subject he said eagerly

  i was about to call you myself tom
got orders tonight leaving in two
days rumor says we go on to manila
cant you drive down tomorrow may
be the last chance to see you and bashy
in a long time i can arrange for shore
leave tomorrow afternoon and evening
if you can come

  right i said we can get away
from here by nine or ten meet us for
luncheon at the grant at one oclock
can do

  can do plenty good said lincoln
and hung up

bathsheba apprised of the mor-
rows trip twittered delightedly and
went to brew a pot of tea for a nightcap
i returned to the other letters in my
study these were the three mailed
from oslo cairo and buenos aires with-
in ten days of one another superficial
examination with a glass showed that
the typing on all three envelopes would
probably prove to be from the same
hammond all had been written by sin-
gleton therefore

  there were two possible explanations
the cairo and buenos aires letters hav-
ing been posted within three days of
each other either a group of persons
were bedeviling morton under the cor-
porate name of singleton or else this
singleton was using one of those inter-
national letter-mailing services-fool
your friends and get a reputation as a
world traveler via steamship stewards
letters written in advance can be post-
ed for a small fee from various ports
this would be a more logical conclusion
than the former i decided

  these letters contained no threats
the enclosures they had contained i
knew must now be in mortons dispatch-
box one typed note read

    i enclose further proof in relation to
  the mystery in the devry family during
   and  the attached copies
  of the chief accountants letters speak
  for themselves i have given you full
  proof that nathaniel devry ii was not
  a devry was not the son of n d i
  at all but was an adopted son these
  enclosures clinch that fact with further
  evidence you must publish them and
  assign credit to me

  the cairo letter indicated purely
business not personal scandal nobody
would care a hang today i thought and
again was wrong in my conclusion
whether nathaniel ii were an adopted
or natural son but here was a beautiful-
black eye on the devry fortune

    i am sending under separate cover
  notarized photostats in support of the
  fact that gow luk toy the last of the
  old hong merchants in canton loaned
  nathaniel ii in   specie
the blue book magazine

  dollars without bond or written note
  and that nathaniel ii later repudiated
  this claim which is still carried on the
  books of the gow family that n d ii
  was dishonest unscrupulous and utterly
  callous will be quite clear to you and to
  your readers

  the third letter had carried an en-
closure which related to opium ship-
ments unluckily i glanced only at the
first page and went no farther

bathsheba came in with the tea-
tray and i laid all these matters
aside she settled herself and gave me a
questioning look as she poured

  about tonight tom whom do you
suspect

  i suspect mortons filipino boy i
rejoined hes undoubtedly a dacoit
chieftain ive just satisfied myself that
kathy was struck with a left-handed
cricket-bat wielded by a cross-eyed swede
named oreilly but since the fili-
pino was on his night out and has no
cricket-bat im flatly up against it
whom do you suspect

  she gave me a reproachful glance
now youre making fun of me of
course id rather think it was that hor-
rid little prissy jessop i havent liked
him since i saw him snoodling in that
bar with that woman whoever she was
anyone whos so crackery one place and
oatmealy another-well ive always said
so anyway she concluded triumphant-
ly and that reminds me tom dont
work so hard on this case that you let all
the blood go to your head

what do you mean i demanded
she surveyed me with her bright gay
smile silly youll need some around
the heart and you dont even know
what her name is

  i girded myself i felt it coming
whose name

  dont look blank kathys name
what do you mean by saying i dont
know it

  well you dont i didnt either till
the other day its not kathy but
cathay and if she isnt in love with
you ill go to manila with lincoln
ive known for a long time you were in
love with her and youd better do the
right thing by her brother mine
oh i said well my good wom-
an if thats the way you feel about it
im off to bed thanks for your tea
ill be up early in the morning and off
to clean up a few things here back and

pick you up around nine and well beat
it for san diego good night

  tom her voice gripped at me as
i reached the door tom what about
kathy

  oh we settled all that tonight she
and i and i grinned at her you
were just about an hour late with your
good advice but i appreciate it all the
same ta-ta

  she caught up a book and i barely
dodged it although it was my precious
presentation copy of sino-iranica i
went my way laughing nothing mat-
tered tonight-nothing the world was
made anew for thomas bodham   

  i wakened at six shaved and slipped
into my clothes and ducked out to seek
breakfast in town intending first to
take a glance around in search of a
muddy spot in the back of my brain
i was trying hard to visualize the man
singleton from the vague outline i had
of him but the drowning of young dev-
ry had to be cleared up and i felt that
the blob of mud in the mercedes was
going to bulk large in the solution

  water was no novelty in pine springs
but mud was rare outside of house gar-
dens it seemed to have no existence tin
ing of a vain search i drove into the
plaza garage and noted the gorgeous
mercedes on the floor luckily the at-
tendant knew me as i had been in here
frequently

  no hurry i said im going across
to get some breakfast fill her up at lei-
sure chock full-gas and oil and water
better check the tires too ill be back
after breakfast mincl if i look over that
mercedes

  help yourself the attendant invited

so i did quite literally i got into
the mercedes and worked fast the
mud was still on the floor but now brok-
en up into a brown smear of dust i
gathered this up and with it a small cot-
tonwood leaf that had been in the mud
and was still stuck to it snapping open
the glove compartment i took a swift
look    cigarettes license wallet a
handsome flask-and one thing more a
house key on a thin silver chain per-
haps the key to the devry house per-
haps not on impulse i pocketed it
since i was to see miss devry at eight i
could hand it over if it was a key to her
mansion if not it might be valuable

  i climbed out walked around the car
saw there was no rear compartment and
then went across the street to a restau-
death on the doorstep

rant i climbed on a stool and ordered
breakfast as i opened the paper i had
brought along i caught the voices of
three young fellows who were ranged
on stools beyond me

  shes no quilapo said one positive-
ly if cryptically

  then what was she doing coming
out of the desert inn at three oclock
tuesday morning

  that dont signify i tell you i
know rose wong-shes no quilapo
rose wong-three oclock tuesday
morning-an hour after young devry
had died according to dr greggs esti-
mate i swung off the stool the three
were just paying their check when i ap-
proached them

  tell me something since i overheard
you what the hell is a quilapo

  they looked at me burst into laugh-
ter and walked out without reply i
turned to the girl behind the counter
resumed my stool and asked her the
meaning of the word she shook her
head

  guess im too old mister been out
of high-school four years now i cant
keep up with the kids

  so    rose worig had been at home
before two by her own testimony but
now-she had left the desert inn whose
expansive grounds front on the center
of town at three oclock something
to think about there

  it was still short of eight oclock when
i passed the devry gate house and drove
on to the mansion after a salute from
the gurfrd but miss devry was waiting
for me in the breakfast-room she hand-
ed me a cup of inky french-roast coffee
and demanded whether i had discovered
anything

  perhaps i said showing her the key
and chain this was in your grand-
nephews car is it a key to this house
does it mean anything to you

  no she said giving it an indiffer-
ent glance but heres the post-mortem
report of the pretona doctor

  from her manner i inferred there was
more to come taking the paper she
handed me i eyed it rapidly the phy-
sician had made one statement of great
interest the lungs of devry were filled
with water indicating death by drown-
ing a postscript stated that the doctor
would await word from her before re-
porting his findings to the authorities

  i sent the boys father up there last
night to give that doctor a piece of my
mind and five hundred dollars to keep

his mouth shut miss devry went on
as usual nathaniel bungled it the
doctor refused to take the money and
now i suppose well have police here
and newspaper men making life miser-
able for me

  i explained that the physician had no
choice she consented finally to let me
tell the pine springs chief of police my-
self

  but she went on i want some def-
inite action out of you bodham youre
taking over this thing to prevent a recur-
rence of such things remember

im no sherlock holmes i shot back

 youre not afraid for yourself

  poppycock she said with a sniff
im afraid of nothing theyre all
afraid of me if they so much as looked
twice at me id clean them out like a
nest of field mice

  who

  my family of course

  but theyve nothiner to do with this
affair

  dont jump to conclusions bodham
i know my family theres not one of
them who wouldnt eat their own
young

  might one of them have come down
through town last night to hit kathy
morton over the head with a flower-
pot

  she looked at me steadily for a mo-
ment and the blood drained out of her
face

  cathay morton she pronounced
the name as it should be pronounced
and not as kathy i noted it because i
had so recently learned what that name
actually was was that girl hurt last
night then what are you doing here
babbling with me what happened

   i told her briefly

  either the house was visited by a
sneak-thief i added or someone who
knew of my appointment with morton
was listening had come for that pur-
pose did you mention the appoint-
ment to anyone

  no she snapped

  i told her about the mercedes could
anyone in this house miss devry have
been listening when you phoned me


the blue book magazine

  i wouldnt put it past any of them
thats why i spoke guardedly she said
grimly if theres anything in the mer-
cedes business the most likely one is
loren-though he may have gone out to
that gambling-club and not to mortons
he asked yesterday if he could have the
mercedes and i refused it would be
like him to go and take it anyway
you cant mean that your family has
only what you let them have i asked
amazed

  they havent a cent beyond what i
give them she fairly barked none of
them has the brains to earn an honest
penny ive pensioned them off i give
em just enough to go to hell with in
their own way tell me what you
learned from dr morton

  i complied laying particular stress on
the name of singleton apparently it
meant nothing whatever to her i told
of mortons labors of the threats against
him and why nine out of ten writers
would have been glad to use such sensa-
tional material as singleton furnished
but morton was actually protecting the
devry family by his scholarly scruples
and i wanted miss devry to know it

  under the circumstances i did not feel
inclined to spare her feelings-if she had
any i told how singleton was linked
by the sign of death to the murder of
young devry then sketched the informa-
tion given in the letters sent morton at
this she evinced a keen but oddly cal-
lous interest that lacked any emotion

  it is all quite true she commented
with a certain satisfaction go on

a mention of nathaniel ii being
an adopted son however brought
a flash of life into her hawklike features

  so he knows that eh let me set
you straight bodham the word adopt-
ed does not give all the facts this man
came to china wormed himself into my
fathers confidence and married my sis-
ter at my fathers insistence he took
the name of nathaniel devry in order
to perpetuate the family line and was
later legally adopted

  i	recalled the genealogy dr morton
had shown me and having a fairly good
photographic mind brought up the pic-
ture of the word adopted after the
name of nathaniel ii

  he was a clever unscrupulous black-
guard miss devry went on and his
whole brood were like him i got you
into this case because my grandnephew
after all bore the name of devry and i

would let no one murder a devry with
impunity it may be that my brother-
she broke off short her lips tight
your brother i said puzzled you
mean nathaniel ii-who married your
sister and was adopted a curious tan-
gle there-

f mean nothing of the sort she
 barked vivid emotion leaped into
her face my real brother my blood
brother detested mercantile life detest-
ed everything around him and dis-
agreed violently with my father he
signed away his birthright and disap-
peared to live his own life

  what name did he take i inquired
and what was the name of nathaniel

ii	before he took the name of devry
all that is none of your business
bodham she said icily keep other
names out of the affair the name of
singleton is nowhere involved if thats
your notion no such name has any
connection with the family

  nathaniel ii she went on was
what we used to call a polecat when i
was younger he made trouble between
my brother and my father he encour-
aged it kept it boiling his game was
to shove the real devrys out of the nest
my brother cleared out i didnt after
my father died this blackguard tried to
contest my legacy i went after him and
beat him luckily he did not live very
long himself ive been winning ever
since and have stayed on top

  then why do you think your brother
might have had something to do with all
this i asked

  possibly this man singleton knew
him knew his story and detested the
other side of the family that might be
his reason for wanting publication of
these scandals

  not likely i said your brother
himself certainly wouldnt want them
published

  bosh why shouldnt they be made
known she snapped with energy let
nathaniel ii be shown to the world for
what he was-a rascal and no devry by
blood let his worthless offspring stew
in the juice of his iniquity do em good
morton is wrong he should accept and
publish these facts i shall see him to-
day and take a hand in this thing myself
hm todays friday and nats fu-
neral is tomorrow must go to los an-
geles for it whining ceremony before
they can ship the ashes east pretence
and nonsense great waste of time


death on the doorstep

  you still want me to work on the
case i asked ill gladly withdraw-
youre on it staiy on it now that
the police must be drawn in make the
best of a bad bargain if this singleton
murdered nat grab him and jail him
before he can murder anyone else
with this she summarily dismissed
me refusing to utter another word in-
deed she had the air of one who regrets
having said too much

  i am not the unerring sleuth of fiction
who sees all and knows all as i drove
away the rueful comprehension of my
own bungling smote me miss devry
had revealed what i should have un-
earthed for myself from the devry gen-
ealogy in mortons study even the
note sent morton telling about the adop-
tion of nathaniel ii had to me seemed
unimportant now i knew better the
mystery of singleton i felt was dis-
pelled it seemed clear he was the miss-
ing brother or a friend of the brother
miss devrys hatred for the remainder
of the family was no longer puzzling

  with this conclusion this assumption
which was to prove so utterly and dread-
fully false i went joyously ahead if
that hard-shelled old dowager had only
confided to me the truths she knew the
whole course of life and death would
have been altered but she kept silent
one moment too long

chapter seven

my interview with miss devry had
been short and fast if not sweet
elated as i was upon my departure the
thought of rose wong recurred to me
best run down that young lady at once
i thought and proceeded to do so

  she had a rented room in a cottage
just off the indian reservation she was
asleep when i called-it was not quite
eight-thirty-but appeared in five min-
utes attractively dressed in sport-shirt
and sharkskin slacks she joined me on
the veranda of the cottage and i came
to the point with blunt attack

  miss wong i knew you were lying
the other morning at the inquest when
you said there was nothing more you
knew now we must know the truth
and i believe it would be easier for you
to tell me than tell the police

  she regarded me steadily without a
trace of any emotion

  i kept back nothing that had to do
with mr devrys death she said

  true perhaps but devry did not
drop you at your home at the time
you said you didnt reach home until
three oclock or after you were seen
leaving the inn now either talk to
me and have no more publicity or ill
inform the police and theyll come after
you i might tell you devry was mur-
dered its not yet generally known

for an instant i thought she would
keel over but almost at once she
calmed herself and now spoke without
restraint

  i-i didnt mean to do wrong i
thought it would only be terrible to
have such things printed he didnt
bring me here at all he drove around
for a while refusing to come here and
finally stopped at a house on the drive
he wanted me to go in with him for a
drink he said the house belonged to
a friend who let him use it at times he
had a key on a silver chain i knew it
wasnt a drink he wanted i refused
he became pleading then insistent
she paused wet her lips then went
on

  there was a big cottonwood tree at
one corner of the yard and i thought i
saw a man standing there-not in the
moonlight but under the shadow of the
tree this frightened me i opened
the door and jumped out nat followed
me he had really been drinking a lot
and was actually drunk he ran after
me he-he was very unsteady-
momentarily her voice failed

  so you ran for it i said

  she nodded yes i ran hard he
kept after me cursing and shouting at
me i ducked in among the houses-
this was at the foot of the hill where
the mountain creek runs i followed it
on into the inn grounds the gate was
open he had stopped following me
then i waited until i was calm again
then came on through the grounds to
the main street and so home

  no hesitation now no more evasion
did you hear anything behind you-
anything like a struggle

  no she said promptly his voice
ended all of a sudden there was a
splash i thought he had fallen into the
creek and-and it made me laugh even
if i was frightened im sorry i didnt
know he was murdered

  nobody knew it i said and after
she had described the house i left

  driving back i stopped at a drug-
store and telephoned austin mcmanus


the blue book magazine

whose real-estate properties lay in the
vicinity of that house when i got him
and described the place he identified it
at once it was not one of his houses
but a private property that had been
leased for the season to a mrs irene
welson of whom he knew nothing

   hopping into the car i drove straight
for the house in question and en route
came to a sudden halt here was the
creek of which rose wong had spoken
a tiny stream that meandered down from
the hills behind at this point it wtas
narrowly confined between cement re-
tainers-a cold little stream knee-cleep
the cement retaining-walls were cob-
bled and rose six inches above the
ground no doubt to keep the stream
confined in time of flood a bad ob-
stacle for a drunken man on a chase
even in moonlight

  i drove on to the house rose wong
had mentioned a man under the cotton-
wood tree a cottonwood a big one
stood there in the corner of the yard a
cottonwood leaf had been embedded in
the blob of dark mud that could have
been left in the mercedes only by the
murderer and in my pocket was the
key on its silver chain the key of this
house	

  as i walked up to the house from the
car i saw that a rose garden was being
laid out toward the cottonwood tree
piles of earth half dispersed over the
ground were still there i rang the bell

  mrs welson opened the door she
was a pleasant little woman of perhaps
forty still evidencing great youthful
beauty at my request to speak with
her she studied me deliberately and
then admitted me into a living-room
that was cheerful and ultra-modern in
its furniture and appointments

having no time to waste i came
straight to the attack

  mrs welson you were a friend of
nathaniel devry

  a friend she showed just the
proper amount of slight surprise i
knew him slightly as one knows so many
people in a place like this

   are you in the habit of letting casual
acquaintances use your house as a place
of assignation

 her face went pale then deepened to
a fiery red but she kept her poise

  mr bodham if thats your name i
dont know what youre driving at

 i think you do mrs welson i said
sympathetically sympathy is always ef-

fective after attack i suggest that you
take a few moments collect yourself and
then tell me the whole story i am in-
vestigating for miss devry and this will
be much better than having to tell the
police

  i have nothing to collect myself
about she said defiantly walking into
the trap having said this she was
committed to answering my questions
without further reflection

  then you admit you knew him
  of course i have said-

  and when did you see him last

  i dont remember she replied look-
ing me straight in the eye

  i smiled come mrs welson i re-
gret having to call that a rather clumsy
falsehood you must credit me with
some intelligence you do know where
you last saw him if he hadnt died i
might believe you had forgotten where
and when but knowing he was dead
youve thought over the matter in every
detail where was it you saw him last

fear and agonized suspense were in
her pleasant eyes by this time

  at-at the isle of araby she jerked
out she was beginning to break down

  what night he died early tuesday
morning you remember was it that
same night

  no the saturday before

  and you gave him this key then i
held up the silver chain and key at
sight of it her face became like death

  no no she persisted i didnt
give it to him he- i must have
dropped it he must have picked it up
then you recognize it a doorkey
on a chain is not easily dropped or lost
without being reclaimed mrs welson
come tell me-you gave it to him on
saturday night

  fright was stamped in her face she
was pitifully nervous frantic before the
approach of more questions i decided
to take a long shot in the dark and see
what developed

  shall i tell you why you gave the key
to devry mrs welson you knew he
wanted to bring rose wong here you
were more than willing why in the
hope of photographing him in some
compromising situation-either you or
the man who was waiting outside a
chance to blackmail the devry family
-or was the murder actually planned
by you

  her eyes widened in acute horror that
could not have been assumed
death on the doorstep

 murder she gasped no he
wasnt murdered he died from heart-
failure

  not at all i told her it has now
been shown to have been murder 
she broke into deep body-racking
sobs her face buried in her hands none
the less i knew she was a woman of reso-
lution it was time to give the finishing
blow i left my chair and crossed to her
on the table beside her was a pile of
magazines my eye fell on them the
top one bore the yellowish tab of an acl-
dressographed subscriber

that name gave me what i wanted
now mrs welson theres no use of
further denials i said gently i al-
ready know all about it mr jessop
has told me everything

  at this her face lifted she stared up
at me eyes wide and fixed a gasp of ter-
ror and dismay escaping her

  he-what did he tell she caught
her breath and then drove on rapidly
yes i let him have the key there was
nothing wrong about that he said he
wanted to use the house-he had no lib-
erty at home i was sorry for him he
said that he wanted to drop in with
some friends and have a card-game   
ajid i was going out of town anyway
where did you go

  she gathered herself together with
an effort at defiance

  i drove down to roydron and i can
prove it i was at the north hotel
so you took that much care eh you
knew it was no innocent boyish party
and when you got back you found dev-
ry was dead who was the man waiting
outside who was this man who mur-
dered devry you know as well as i
do

  i do notl she flashed up into sud-
den life her agonized protest rang
true i was gone i tell you i didnt
return until next day how could i
know who was outside

  are you prepared to swear that it
was not mr jessop but someone else

no use she was over the hump by
this time and getting back her nor-
mal resolution

  of course i am so far as im pre-
pared to swear to anything that hap-
pened while i was a hundred miles
away she shot out how do i know
anything about it its true that mr
jessop is a friend ive met him several
times if he had anything to do with
this how would i know it

  very well i said and turned to the
door your argument is sound-so far
what you and jessop planned is some-
thing the police will have to elicit i
fear

  her armor could not be pierced she
answered with a defiant sneer about the
police and with a bow i left her

  outside i walked over toward the
cottonwood tree the earth that had
obviously been imported for the forma-
tion of the rose-garden was a darkish
mold i took a sample knowing it
would match with the mud taken from
the mercedes then i climbed into my
car and drove off

  one thing now remained to do and
i headed for police headquarters i was
getting action this morning and getting
it with a vengeance when i reached
headquarters i found that chief bishop
had just arrived for the day and was
taken to his office

i had seen the chief at the inquest
but i had never met him bishop
was by no means the abysmal brute po-
liceman of detective classics he was a
large quiet cultured man with so pleas-
ant and amiable a personality that one
did not at once realize the force and abil-
ity of his character

  ive heard of your work mr bod-
ham and have hoped to meet you said
he as we shook hands not profession-
ally of course we dont have any seri-
ous crime in our town and dont want
any

  youve got a handful already i said
dryly and handed him the post-mortem
report

  he knew his business before i had
more than started my story he got the
desk-man on the interphone and ordered
the mercedes brought from the garage
for investigation and possible finger-
prints then he listened attentively un-
til i had finished

  weve never had a murder in pine
springs he said almost plaintively
im sorry about this well still hope
its not murder except for that she-
nanigan with the corpse this might be
a normal accidental drowning lets
have everything youve picked up

  he called in his secretary and i went
over the case in detail young devrys
spick-and-span clothes still puzzled me
but bishop made light of the fact

  weve got a good fingerprint man
said he dobbs is right up to the latest
tricks most crooks dont yet know that
the blue book magazine

prints can now be brought up from fab-
rics we may get something from those
clothes now bodham how far may
we count on your help

  all the way i said miss devry
has retained me to find devrys mur-
derer im off to san diego as soon as i
leave you but ill be back tonight or
early in the morning

  then suppose you tell me what you
think about the assault on miss morton
last night you mentioned it in passing
thats something we havent heard of
i went into that briefly there was not
much to tell and whether dr morton
would want the incident investigated by
the police i did not know the only
tangible evidence was that scratch on
the adobe wall outside the window the
possibility of the mercedes having been
used by someone connected with the as-
sault was also worth noting down

  ill find out quick enough who took
it from the garage last night said
bishop do you lay this happening
and devrys murder to the same hand
its possible i had not of course
mentioned singleton or dr mortons
revelations this i must clear up with
morton himself before going farther

  about this man jessop said bishop
did the welson woman confirm your
theory that jessop had been in a black-
mail scheme

  no it wasnt a theory-just a shot
in the dark i admitted jessop ap-
parently is in love with this woman
theres nothing to prove he was the
man under the tree the night of devrys
murder hes not the type to murder
anyone

  did he have any alibi that night i
think he testified at the inquest

  i nodded no alibi he was in bed
asleep he has a cottage of his own
you might have mrs welson kept un-
der observation also her house and tele-
phone

  ill check on the lady agreed bishop

so much had transpired that it was
difficult to realize the hour was not
yet ten when i halted the car in front of
our cottage bathsheba was across at the
morton gate talking with kathy

  except for a silk turban about her
head hiding all traces of her injury
kathy looked her normal self

 dont mind me children said
bathsheba

  i kissed kathy and found that all had
been quiet in the morton home

  well i said drawing bathsheba
away tell your grandfather that ive
been called away-but i suppose bashy
has told you eh all right we may
get back late tonight so ill see your
grandfather in the morning and well
go into matters all ready bashy
by kathy see you later

  we were away at last but we were
not away from the devry case we had
to go through town to reach pretona
and the san diego highway on the out-
skirts i swung out to pass another car
bathsheba let out a yip

  tom theres that woman now-in
that car the woman who was with
jessop at the bamboo bar

  i had paid the car no attention now
i slowed and looked into the rear view
mirror at the car behind it was a light
sedan the woman beside the driver
was no other than mrs welson and
the man driving the car was peterson
miss devrys secretary

chapter eight

as we twisted over the cut-off and
 headed for the south i paid scant
attention to bathshebas light chatter

   the letters the personality of single-
ton the queer mass of futile menace and
vain but vindictive strivings at publicity
centering about gentle old dr morton
fascinated me the coin glued to a
sheet of paper with no obvious message
plucked at my imagination the defi-
nite threat with its line of marching fig-
ures and the cryptic sentence beneath
them rose before my somewhat photo-
static brain with nagging insistence

   i dont know that id like california
as a steady thing bathsheba observed
glorious sunshine and cold nights
would get monotonous in time here
its almost november and no real
thanksgiving weather at all

   isnt the weather its the turkey i
commented

  she sniffed so you think i just
dont know what president roosevelt
was thinking of to change the dates all
around not that i blame him a mite
if i could do it myself id change the
calendar all around and make it sen-


death on the doorstep

sible i dont see why on earth the fiscal
year should start along in the middle of
the real year anyhow it mixes every-
body up and then the taxes come due
in march-thats just plain silly either
the taxes should come due the first of
the year or we should change the first
of the year around to march-

  holy smoke i exclaimed jamming
on the brakes they squealed bath-
sheba did likewise and the car came to
a stop in the middle of the highway

tom bodham have you gone out

  x of your senses cried bathsheba
straightening her hat whats wrong

  nothing i grinned and released
the brakes just thought of some-
thing

  we went on again i heard not a
word of what bathsheba was saying and
small wonder for her nonsense about
the calendar had flung a sudden white
light on that cryptic sentence beneath
the line of little marching soldiers

  the third shall be first again taken
in connection with those soldiers on the
march-that was it march the old
roman calendar had begun with march
the english legal year had begun in
mrch until in  it was changed to
january first the third shall be first
again-that was it the name of march
entered into this puzzle somewhere and
somehow

  elated by this discovery i whirled
bathsheba down to san diego in record
time and when we reached the hotel
lincoln was there to meet us it was one
oclock and we went directly in to lunch

  over the table lincoln did most of
the talking for once the navy if not
the country at large was imbued with
the certainty of war coming in the ori-
ent and lincoln wras filled with this de-
lusion he was a thin dark and rather
serious sort weighted by the thought of
a wife and two children whom he had
left back east just now however he
was filled with an unwonted gayety for
if he went to the orient his family
would probably be sent after him as it
would be a two-year assignment

  so today we found him much less
serious than usual giving full vent to his
droll if caustic inspirations bathsheba
ate hurriedly and then departed to do
some shopping promising to meet us at
two which was manifestly impossible

  well be in the cocktail lounge i
told her ill put my puzzles up to
lincoln and well wait for you there

  so you came down to get something
out of me did you observed lincoln
when she had left us i might have
known it you and your bits of twine
caught in the murderers little toenail
never mind link i said amiably
there are worse crimes than murder-
far worse suppose we adjourn to the
lounge and relax over the right sort of
a drink to follow this meal and get the
agony over it may amuse you at that
its right up your alley 

  lincoln worships the navy has hap-
pily large ideals and regards my profes-
sion as a somewhat infantile occupation
for little minds this time however i
had hit his hobby interests and he lis-
tened with interest as i laid my problems
before him he looked over the letters
and envelopes studied the coin on the
paper and shoved the latter at me with
a twinkle in his deep eyes

 what do you make of this thing
yourself tom

  i shrugged im ignorant of coins
and you know it the paper is a stout
rag paper not watermarked it could
be traced to some maker if worth the
trouble of doing so

  youre a queer bird he said with
a chuckle offhand id say theres only
one obvious thing here the coin is
glued to the paper in order to hide some-
thing or to protect something under it
or both why not take it off the paper
and have a look

  quite true but i wanted you to see
it just as it is i evaded actually this
obvious conclusion had not occurred to
me any more than it had to morton

  well its an unusually large bronze
coin he said eying it for example
the napoleon silver five-franc piece
weighs  grains and is slightly larger
yet this must weigh all of five hundred
grains a coin lets call it a penny of
antiochus epiphanes dating from about
 bc not rare and of no particular
value now for the secret

he began to separate the coin from
the paper very carefully i
watched with a thrill of anticipation
if something were written underneath
it might well confirm my theory about
the name of march entering into this
case the paper came clear and i
seized upon it eagerly writing the
first actual handwriting of singleton it
was a fine clear writing and read

    publish singleton or the thun-
  derbolts will strike -


the blue book magazine

  silently lincoln showed the reverse
of the coin which bore on the obverse
the head of antiochus here in the
center was the figure of an eagle hold-
ing thunderbolts this figure had been
delicately pricked out in gilt by single-
ton to make it strike the eye immedi-
ately and the gilt had been protected
against rubbing by gluing the coin to
the paper thus the coin emphasized
the threat of the words and illustrated it

morton had said this coin was but
lately arrived the poor condition
of the paper however and the discolor-
ation everywhere except in the circle
formed by the coin showed that it had
been a long time put together prob-
ably singleton had prepared it long in
advance-another evidence of vacillation

  your singleton has a devious brain
lincoln commented in his caustic way
a curious and frustrated juvenile brain
delighting in queer involved things
and i should say your client has an
equally childish brain one man puts
up involved puzzles the other doesnt
even know theyre puzzles or doesnt
try to solve them

  this i had to admit was close to the
truth dr morton had wasted no time
trying to solve the puzzles handed him
by singleton he had just disregarded
them with a calm disdain

  the conclusion in regard to single-
ton became further emphasized when
we tackled the letter with the supposed-
ly unissued stamp upon which lincoln
put his instant attention

  this is a rather remarkable thing
tom he said true the stamp was
not issued in this bicolor form all the
same its quite genuine alter the color
of a stamp and it will still go through
the mails-as a rule a good deal of in-
genuity has been expended by cheap
rascals in changing the color or shade
of stamps in order to make them valu-
able to collectors

  it can be done by chemicals i put
in and he nodded

  yes as a result it can always be de-
tected the quartz ultra-violet lamp
has put a final clincher on such efforts
thanks to fluorescence however look
at this stamp that central michigan
seal was not changed by fumes or acid
-the entire stamp would have been af-
fected now theres one way and one
way only in which the shade or even
color of a stamp can be altered beyond
any detection thus far its not known

to the confraternity of forgers and ras-
cals i unearthed it myself

  he paused as though loath to inform
even me of his philatelic discoveries

  in certain parts of the world such
as this- portion of california he went
on slowly sunlight contains infra-rays
more powerful than elsewhere most
dyed fabrics for example will fade
swiftly here if exposed to sunlight so
will stamps but not only do they fade
but they will even assume strange tints
as the yellow or red content is acted up-
on had this particular stamp been
kept in midsummer sunlight a few days
it would turn into a pronounced blue
it was obviously fitted with a mask
which allowed only the central design
to turn blue thus producing a bicolored
stamp-which in all truth was never
issued by the government

  arguing cleverness and careful prep-
aration on the part of mr singleton i
deduced frustrated and hesitant he
may be vacillating and negative-but
hes not wasting work deliberately
curious that your client whoever
he is should have noticed the stamp
yet allowed his interest to die there
the man concerned i said the
dr morton to whom these letters are
addressed is an old man he noticed
the stamp true it was meant by sin-
gleton that he should notice it obviously
why lincoln weve already uncovered
the clue a message under the coin
naturally presupposes a message under
this stamp tear the stamp off

but lincoln caught my hand as i
reached for the envelope

  not so fast tom-careful old boy
if you remove a stamp from an enve-
lope ten to one the stamp is ruined it
tears but if you remove the envelope
from the stamp then you preserve the
stamp intact and the envelope tears an
elementary bit of philatelic lore many
a valuable stamp has been ruined before
this fact was learned in this case we
want to preserve the envelope-

  as he spoke he had been wetting the
stamp dipping his finger in his glass and
getting the oblorig bit of paper well
soaked he let it rest for a moment
drawing my attention to the large size
of this stamp which would permit quite
a message to be concealed by it

  a tentative effort-another and he
wet the stamp anew it began to come
more easily typing showed as it
stripped away a moment more and it

death on the doorstep

was completely gone to reveal four lines
of typing which it had barely hidden

          unless you publish
          the proof that nil
          was hugh march not
          you but cathay dies

  good god i broke out shes the
one threatened then and he never
discovered this never let me know never
let me suspect    perhaps he wasnt
sure himself-why heres the proof that
the blow over the head was actually an
attempt to kill her that devil single-
ton isnt vacillating any longerl

ejcqln was staring blankly at me i
glanced at my watch two oclock
we had to wait here until bathsheba re-
turned she had said two this would
mean three at earliest

  link well have to push off as soon
as bashy shows up i said abruptly
we had meant to have the evening
with you but thats impossible i must
get back to pine springs in a hurry
he nodded so i gather you cant
shove off till bashy shows up and shes
not shown up yet so why not let me in
on it woman in it somewhere by the
wild look in your eye who

  with an effort i forced down my ex-
citement the puzzle was clearing up
the name of nathaniel ii before his
adoption into the devry family had
been hugh march my deductions
were right hugh march

  fthis threat is definitely against
kathy i said thats why i must get
back there the things imminent dan-
gerous she must be guarded until i
can run down this singleton devil and
i went on to tell him about the case

  i had just concluded when bathsheba
appeared laden down with pasteboard
boxes when i announced that we were
leaving immediately she cried

  but tom im absolutely exhausted
from tramping around that big store and
making decisions i want a highball
then grab it and well get off i
said impatiently while youre get
ting it ill hunt up a phone-booth
cant take any chances now ill phone
morton and make sure kathy is well
guarded till we get back

  i located a booth and put in a long
distance call for dr mortons number
instead of the usual quick connection
there was a delay which irritated me
at length came the cheerful statement
heres your party go ahead

  hello i said is this you mor-
ton

  who are you came the response in
a strange voice

  confound it this must be the wrong
number i exclaimed im calling
dr morton at pine springs

  this is mortons house came back
the same voice who are you

  mortons house then who the dev-
ils speaking this is tom bodham
and i want dr morton

  oh the voice held quick relief
this is chief bishop mr bodham
where are you

  i was startled at the grant in san
diego what are you doing at mortons
house a frightful conjecture seized
me is something wrong is kathy-
shes quite all right broke in the
chief but ive been moving heaven
and earth to find you bodham-

  five minutes later i stumbled out of
the booth and made my way back to the
cocktail lounge my emotion must have
shown in my face for lincoln came to
his feet with a sharp exclamation and
bathsheba gasped as she also rose

  tom she cried you look like a
ghost-what is it tell us quickly-some-
things hurt you

  yes it has i said and drew a deep
breath dr morton was murdered
early this afternoon

         chapter nine

   that was a fast wild trip back to
   pine springs it was nearly dark
   when i hopped out of the car before
   police headquarters sent bathsheba on
   to look after kathy and was shown into
   bishops private office

     the chief was looking worried he
   plunged into the midst of things with-
   out preamble

     miss morton found her grandfathers
   body on the library floor about two-
   thirty it was at this time gregg got the
   telephone call went over found the
   death not natural and summoned me
   he lighted a cigar and leaned back
   who was with her when she discov-
   ered it i asked

     andreas the filipino boy bishop
   spoke in his rather staccato way but
   with a grim manner now get this
   during luncheon dr morton suggested
   that she and andreas drive to the motor
   vehicle department office to check up
   on the renewal of the boys license as
   
the blue book magazine

chauffeur as it proved the trip was
not necessary morton obviously cleared
the house for a certain purpose miss
morton found the body on her return
when she and andreas departed jes-
sop had remained at the house

  so jessop was the last to see dr mor-
ton alive i asked

  he grimaced far from it jessop
went to town about one says he got
the mail then went to mrs welsons
house and sat around on the porch wait-
ing for her drove back home about
two not having seen her garaged his
car and went into his own quarters at
the rear came out when he heard a
determined ringing at the house bell
went around house found loren an-
drey and the devry chauffeur the chink
on the front porch

  the chauffeur why

  dr morton had phoned miss devry
asking her to send andrey and someone
else down at once said he was to have
a meeting with singleton and wanted
two witnesses there

  singleton i exclaimed a meet-
ing how do you know all this

  miss devry sent andrey he told
me i called her back and confirmed it
and by the way she doesnt know yet
that morton is dead nobody knows
ive kept it secret till you got here

he went on jessop it seemed spoke
with the two callers as morton
had not answered the bell they conclud-
ed he was asleep and refused to wait
longer jessop went to the gate with
them and saw miss morton returning
loren andrey seemed peeved at having
come on a useless errand and drove off
when miss morton came she went in
the house discovered the body and had
jessop telephone gregg

  and the cause of death i asked
bishop screwed up his face examined
his cigar and looked at me resignedly
believe it or not drowning

  this jolted me again so he ex-
pected to meet singleton wanted wit-
nesses-and was killed none the less
why did he want witnesses after clear-
ing the house himself it doesnt make
sense i suppose you believe in single-
tons existence now

  bodham im not sure about any-
thing said the chief sadly the last
man we know to have been with mor-
ton in life was peterson	

  here was another facer how does
miss devrys secretary get into this

  he drove into it andrey told me
that as he and the chink chauffeur
neared the house they saw a car leaving
peterson and two other men were in it
you see all this happened like a string
of firecrackers - snap-snap-snap one
leaves another comes i called peter-
son he admitted it readily nothing
secret about it he was planning to
buy a lot adjoining the morton prop-
erty and the two men with him were
ed parks and gil stuart

  their names are vaguely familiar
i commented

bishop grinned ought to be plas-
tered on real-estate signs for miles
around they give peterson complete
backing in fact they saw morton alive
after peterson left him

  i was puzzled by this until the chief
explained and laid before me a rough
sketch it showed dr mortons house
which fronted my own cottage on a short
dead-end road just off the highway

  the two real-estate men halted their
car outside the boundary wall not turn-
ing in dr morton was walking in the
garden said bishop and peterson talked
with him the real-estate men sittingin
the car morton and peterson went in-
to the house presently they came out
and after a moment or two peterson re-
turned to the car the other men saw
morton after peterson rejoined them
how do you know they did
theyre both trustworthy said the
chief also they were listening to the
car radio as they waited when peter-
son rejoined them the two oclock kfi
news program had just begun the an-
nouncer was still speaking they drove
on to the end of the road took a look
at the lots peterson asked a few ques-
tions and picked the lot he wanted to
buy while they were doing this dr
morton must have been murdered
yes how can you be sure

  they drove away past the doctors
house and turning into the highway
loren andrey who was approaching
saw them as they passed him

  the time sequence was really quite
simple peterson and the two real-estate
men had departed at two oclock get-
ting a glimpse of morton in the garden
as they drove off morton must have
gone into the house at once and called
miss devry at three minutes past two
she was positive about the time

  loren andrey at her request had
hopped into the car and driven down

pgath on the doorstep

here with the chinese chauffeur-a mat-
ter of ten minute at most he had
raised nobody jessop arriving talked
with him he departed and miss mor-
ton had come home almost at once the
time of the murder then must have
been immediately after mortons phone
call to miss devry and before jessops
arrival

  its rather absurd i said because
drowning takes a bit of time was there
any sign of a struggle

  none at all bishop replied i al-
most jugged jessop on suspicion he ac-
tually had the shakes loren andrey
however had seen him come home re-
member

  i nodded frowning over the puzzle
how do you know the exact time mor-
ton telephoned miss devry

  that was a lucky break bishop re-
plied beaming morton wanted to
check the time with her on account of
singletons visit and didnt have the
right time himself the old lady swears
by an electric clock thats one of her
chief pets she gave him the time mor-
ton said that loren andrey could easily
get there before singleton was due and
rang off    whats the matter bod-
hm you look as though you didnt
believe it

  i believe it but dont like it i said
its phony about morton being worried
over the time too

  phony why so

  he has a very fine watch one of those
swiss things with a split second and
stopwatch arrangement and several
dials he was proud that it never
varied hed have been more likely to
tell her the time than to ask it

  you couldnt tell that old hellcat
anything said the chief confidentially
he shoved a carbon of a stenographic
report at me i had both sides of our
phone conversation taken down look
at the language she used

  i glanced over it and smiled sure
she doesnt know morton is dead

  i warned peterson under pain of ob-
structing justice to say nothing parks
and gil stuart wont talk nor gregg
nor miss morton and those there
andrey and the chink chauffeur
dont know anything about it
then ill drop up and brace miss
devry i said i have a hunch that
her brother is this mysterious single-
ton

  the hell you say i didnt know she
had a brother

  i sketched rapidly the story of the
elusive original nathaniel ii bishop
agreed that in the shock of the news
miss devry might well drop some in-
formation of value he put the police
car at my service with one of his men
to drive at the door i halted and
turned back asking whether he had ob-
tained any information from the mer-
cedes car he called for his fingerprint
expert dobbs who brought in the en-
largements of some prints

  one set belongs to devry explained
dobbs some belong to rose wong
as we expected some are unidentified
-probably from garage helpers but
ive traced this set half a dozen in all
to loren andrey

  how do you know i demanded
you havent booked him

  dobbs grinned naw i collect
prints just asked him for them one
day awhile back got rose wongs that
way too most people get a kick out of
having their prints taken

  then andrey might have taken the
mercedes that night miss morton was
hurt

  not might but did bishop threw
in admitted- it drove out to the
kubla club and dropped a hundred
dollars at the roulette table drove one
of his friends home has a perfect alibi
he just isnt the one who hit miss mor-
ton bodham

i was forced to agree not without sat-
isfaction he really didnt fit into
our picture he might have some of the
characteristics but could not be single-
ton

bishop grunted you still think
both killings the work of one person
yes same method of killing same
dry clothes same absence of direct evi-
dence and positive motives

  he dissented to me devry was
drowned from expediency he was
drunk probably helpless chased the
girl to the stream and fell over it sin-
gleton catches up and dunks his head
i scouted around there this morning and
found a scuffed place where it hap-
pened so that was accident you might
say the other was not


the blue book magazine

  find any footprints there or in
mortonsgarden

  he shook his head nothing there
of any clarity mortons garden nope
gravel path rye-grass nothing hap-
pened there anyhow he went in to
telephone miss devry and was killed
in the house

  just the same might he have been
drowned in the garden

  no thats the very point bod-
ham no standing or running water
there theres an old empty alabaster
bird-bath in the garden but its dry
yes i remember it i said dis-
used by its looks

  the filipino said it hasnt held any
water for a couple of years pipes
choked up or broken that leaves the
bathrooms in the house in my check-
up i saw no signs of splashed water or
scuffed walls no sign of struggle no
evidence of water being flung around
suppose singleton had doped him
first hypodermic

  thatd leave a mark and his body
was examined believe me no bruises
no crack over the head he went on
mournfully look here spose you
drop by greggs office and see what he
thinks about the doping angle he
might put us wise to something that
could have been used in the time sin-
gleton had at his disposal

  good idea ill do that but with
everything pointing to singleton as mur-
derer of both men why do you doubt
the fact

 hunch bishop shrugged sup-
pose no  knows singleton killed devry
and got away with it as a natural death
and he no  has an airtight alibi for
that killing he kills morton the same
way hoping well think it a natural
death also if we found it to be murder
it might open up the devry case and
would be laid to the same killer and
with his airtight alibi in the former in-
stance no  would be beyond suspi-
cion how does it sound

i grinned involved but interest-
ing chief only its hard to believe
in two murderers where there ought not
to be even one

  yes-a nice clean-cut average homi-
cide husband-kills-lover or bandit-shoots-
in-get-away-well you could savvy that
itd be natural but this sort of mystery
killing is out of place in pine springs
i left and the driver took me first to
see dr gregg

  the medico had a penthouse office
and bungalow this in pine springs
meant the roof of a one-story building
his office at the head of the stairs was
dark so i turned to the bungalow he
hailed me from the door as i ap-
proached and shook hands heartily

  come in glad to see you damned
shame about poor morton whats be-
hind it

  the more we figure the less we un-
derstand i said wryly dropping into a
chair in his living-room i dropped
in to see if you could suggest how mor-
ton might have submitted so tamely to
being drowned

as i sketched the problem he wrin-
l kled up his face in thought

  nope if the murderer had used a
drug that would hit so hard and fast he
might as well have gone the whole hog
and used it to kill morton no evidence
of hypodermic puncture no marks of
strangulation or skull contusion the
man was drowned thats all

  he mixed a drink for which i was
grateful grateful enough in fact to
give him the odd story of singleton as i
had it from morion rot mentioning
miss devrys missing brother with
what i had unearthed i assumed sin-
gleton to be a case of inferiority com-
plex gone wild but gregg shook his
head

  a neurosis isnt so easily bounded as
all that bodham such psychiatric
analysis is apt to lead a layman into a
cul-de-sac no neurosis is simple you
mustnt overlook the possibility of mix-
tures with human life at stake-

  and if we put any credence in sin-
gletons warning beneath the stamp
there is a human life at stake i ex-
claimed warmly since that crack on
the head didnt kill her hell definitely
try-

  i broke off abruptly it came to me
like that between two words

  gregg stared at me in astonishment

  whats the matter isnt the whisky
good

  its jessop i broke out single-
ton is jessop-of course he had the
weakest alibi in both cases he sleeps
alone in his shack he could have gone
to the welson house killed devry and
brought him back as a ghastly demon-
stration to morton a dead devry to
back up all his threats in this mystery
which concerns the devry family alone
hes worked for years with morton
death on the doorstep

and knows all about his work and his
books-

  but hold on protested gregg

  i brushed his words aside

  last night he knew i was coming
over to talk with morton he was sup-
posed to be in town instead he was
at that window listening hes the one
who struck down kathy

  easy bodham gregg exclaimed an
amused glint in his eye wait now-
dont interrupt i rushed on excit-
edly i remember now when he came
into the house he knew all about kathy
having been hit he even asked if there
had been a fracture you see how
could he have known unless he were
the man who hit her

  because i told him said gregg

  i gaped at him thunderstruck he
went on with a quiet smile

  he was sitting in the same row with
me at the movie house i climbed over
his knees going out i had to come back
to excuse myself to my guests so i told
jessop to come out to the lobby he did
so i told him of the emergency call
and offered to take him out to the mor-
ton house he had a lady with him-
refused my invitation and said hed
take the lady home and then be out

  i departed not too happily and the
police car whirled me up toward the
devry mansion on the hillside gregg
had knocked jessop out of the box and
so beautifully that the memory stung

iss devry was waiting for me she
was in no amiable mood as she
conveyed to me on the spot in a voice
like a file as yet neither she nor any-
one else knew of mortons death

  well bodham what did you turn
up on your wild-goose chase

  the identity of singleton for one
thing

  she stiffened bosh no such per-
son bodham all nonsense

  not at all miss devry you may be
shielding him deliberately-

  bodham have you gone mad she
broke in furiously why should i
shield him

  because of what took place today at
mortons house

  well what the devil took place
she demanded dr morton phoned
me he had an appointment with this
singleton i thought he was under
some delusion and still think so an-
drey didnt even see him what took
place then

  this time i said your brother
overreached himself

  she was almost spitting fire what
in gods name has my brother got to do
with all this or with singleton

your brother is singleton thats all
she regarded me with a pitying snort
so youre really insane are you and
expect me to share your delusions
the police share them at least
what are you driving at she
snapped my brother had nothing to
do with the death of nat devry

  perhaps not but he had everything
to do with the murder of dr david
morton

  as she looked at me her face changed
it became old and drawn and haggard
a gray waxen mask in which the eyes
grew large her voice came in a whisper
murder-you say he was murdered-
she crumpled up in the chair i
sprang to her side found that her heart
was all right and poured her a pony of
brandy from the open tantalus the
first taste of it brought her around

  i had not dreamed she would take
the news of mortons death so hard she
demanded fiercely to know everything
that had happened and sat in frozen si-
lence while i told her

  then for a moment her eyes closed
i thought she was going to faint again
instead she opened her eyes and gave
me a challenging look

  bodham youre not the fool i called
you its all my own fault god for-
give me i should have told you earlier
what i asked

  that david morton was my brother

chapter ten

so there the secret was out-the secret
that might have changed everything
had i known it sooner nor was this
all miss devry now poured out the
entire background of her own story of
mortons of the family history this
woman of iron broke down completely
she became a querulous whimpering
woman holding back nothing she even
went into her own tragic destiny a typi-
cally mid-victorian affair an engage-
ment of a year or more to some young
man who had died before the wedding

  it was upon the story of march that
i seized eagerly it would be amplified
i knew by the papers in the tin dispatch-
box but here in brief i sifted the im-
portant details from her flood of words
the blue book magazine

  nathaniel ii-later to become david
morton-had gone from quarrel to quar-
rel with his father who wanted a com-
mercial heir and not a physician in the
family hugh march came into the
business from nowhere the family
were living in canton at the time young
march had showed up in canton mar-
ried eliza devry-and disagreed violently
with nathaniel ii the latter plunged
into drinking and gambling in a wild
and desperate effort to shame the hard
old nathaniel i the father refused to
be shamed instead he kicked out the
boy after giving him a few thousand
dollars

  march had a hand in it and after
that the interloper hugh march as-
sumed the legal name of nathaniel
devry ii

  edna devry never ceased to combat
march years later she tracked down
her brother who refused outright to
have anything to do with the family
without his knowledge she secretly sup-
plied him with funds enabling him to
retire and settle down at pine springs
twenty years ago with the grandchild
who represented his entire world

  singleton more cryptic than ever
there were no other devry children of
her own generation said miss devry
she knew absolutely nothing about any
singleton another pony of brandy
and she became somewhat more herself
demanding to know what was being
done about the murder of morton

told her what bishop had already
done she was no longer defiant her
face stamped with a numb misery she
nodded to anything i suggested

  are you certain i asked her that
the man who telephoned you was dr
morton

  i had no reason to think otherwise
she rejoined of course i had never
spoken to him on the telephone before
i suppose i couldnt swear to it

  did the voice sound like that of any-
one else

  no she said reflectively

  did morton say anything make any
remark tell you anything beyond what
you have reported to chief bishop
she frowned shook her head checked
herself yes wait he did mention
that peterson had given him a letter
from singleton-he said peterson had
just been there

  id like to speak with peterson miss
devry if you dont mind

  she acceded with apparent relief
peterson appeared exuding cordiality
and servile good nature we spoke
about mortons death he showed the
proper evidences of shock the proper
interest in my wanting to ask a few ques-
tions my respect for him grew momen-
tarily the man had his parts

 tust how did you happen to go in to
i see dr morton did you know him
i asked any shred of information
you know may help us to unravel this
frightful tangle

  ive been thinking of buying a place
here that i might come to some day
when i retire he said with a sidelong
glance at miss devry i had looked at
the lot beyond dr mortons place and
had worried about the soil whether it
were too sandy to grow tomatoes i
have an ambition to grow tomatoes it
is really a great hobby of mine so as
we drove past the house and saw him
walking in the garden mr stuart sug-
gested that i ask dr morton who had
been here so long i did he showed
me some of his shrubs discussed the soil
and i came away	

  and the letter i asked

  he regarded me blankly yes what
letter mr bodham

  the one you gave dr morton
oh that letter i had completely
forgotten it his face cleared and he
laughed in confusion yes when i
stopped for the mail there was a letter
for dr morton in our box i discovered
it later on when i was sorting out the
mail here at the house

  and that was your real reason per-
haps for going to dr mortons house
peterson looked puzzled no no i
put the letter in my pocket meaning to
take it back to the post office then i
forgot all about it until i was talking
with dr morton in his garden it was
just a letter-id not have paid it any
attention had he not seemed so shocked
when he tore it open

  what was the letter like where
from

  i really didnt notice sir peterson
stated

  you say he seemed shocked

  so it struck me sir i paid no atten-
tion of course it was none of my affair
i thanked dr morton for his kindness
and went out to the car and that was
all

  that was all for peterson indeed i
got rid of him and turned to miss devry


death on the doorstep

  you see i told her morton called
you three minutes utter the letter was
from singleton announcing a personal
interview morton told you so asked
you to send andrey and someone else-
two witnesses he appealed to you in
his agitation and dismay now you can-
not doubt the existence of singleton
miss devry was doubting nothing she
appealed to me to spare no money no
expense she wanted rewards offered
she begged me to have kathy guarded

  she must be watched day and night
bodham shes definitely in danger
why should she be in danger

v bodham youre hopeless shes the
heiress to the devry millions of course
i the light broke upon me i stared
at her and at last found words

  is this whats behind all your queer
ways yes yes-you hate the rest of
them you knew morton was your broth-
er-so this explains your silence you
made your brother heir to your fortune
and his granddaughter after him

   exactly she shot out with a defiant
glare shes the only true devry alive
i would get into no argument al-
ready i was thinking ahead wishing i
hd known these things long before
what a bearing all this might have on
the present and future

  who knows of this i demanded
sharply you and the lawyer who drew
up your will-and who else

   no one of course she declared posi-
tively

  bosh i snapped at her look-
use your head you think no one knows
eh where has the will been kept since
your lawyer drew it up in his office
files no doubt

  not at all she rejoined the sen-
ior partner died two years ago i dont
approve of the junior partners i sought
another legal firm and transferred my
personal business to them but i kept
the will myself its in my safety-deposit
box at home in baltimore

ow were getting somewhere i
exclaimed youve given others
access to that box of course careful
now dont lie to me miss devry dont
hold anything back

  you impertinent- confound you
bodham i suppose youre right she re-
plied yes the will is in a sealed en-
velope so ive never worried about any-
ones seeing it ive sent clerks to the
box-the company lawyers who handle
my income-tax my secretary peterson

my nephew nathaniel iii-occasionally
he handles some charity matters for me
its about the limit of his capacity

  i leaned back and drew a deep breath
all those people and you think no-
body could break into a sealed envelope
and seal it again-or use a new envelope
do you know what i think of you

  she sat for a moment gazing at me
then nodded

  youre right bodham im a damned
fool i guess

  i broke into a laugh miss devry i
didnt say that youve got me there
let me use your phone will you then
i must get back to chief bishop and
have a bite of supper

when i phoned the morton house
i was answered by the man bishop
had left there he called bathsheba she
told me kathy had gone to sleep upon
a sedative from dr gregg and all was
well bidding her await me i rang off
said good night to miss devry and short-
ly was speeding back to headquarters

  bishop was awaiting me when he
heard my news about the letter from
singleton his eyes bulged but upon
learning mortons identity he threw upj
his hands

  well thats one for the book bodjj
ham apparently the only man who
could have helped us with singleton  is
dead

  did morton have that letter in his
pockets

  the chief produced a list and we
eyed it no letter had been found on
mortons body

  he went in from the garden and
called miss devry might have left the
letter in the study bishop said hope-
fully ive waited for you before go-
ing over the place what say we run
out there now could stand a bite to
eat first

  suits me i assented suppose we
speak with those realtors parks and
stuart id like to hear from them ex-
actly what took place

  bishop scooped up his phone and ar-
ranged with them to meet us in five min-
utes at the grill across the street

  there in a booth we talked-and the
two realtors told all i wanted to learn

  peterson had been dickering with
them for the past month on the sale of
that lot they said stuart meeting him
the previous evening had suggested the
mornings trip it had been put off until
after lunch both of them were positive

the blue book magazine

that they had suggested to peterson that
he pop in and ask dr morton about the
soil for his tomatoes they had wanted
peterson to get unbiased information

  we had pulled up alongside one of
those square-barred openings in mor-
tons wall said gil stuart we could
see dr morton through an opening in
the bushes he was wearing a real gaudy
dressing-gown ive known him for
years and i called to him he waved
back peterson hopped out walked to
the gate near the garage and went in to
talk with the doctor we saw them go
into the house apparently pretty soon
they came back peterson stopped and
talked then came along and got into the
car the news broadcast had just come
on we listened to it as we drove along
to the end of the road

  you saw dr morton and peterson
after they had been in the house
sure they came out and were
walking up and down-we could see
them among the bushes peterson
called good-by to morton and came
through the gate to the car we had
another glimpse of the doctor standing
there we could see him through the
oleanders that opening in the outside
wall was just like a window you know
i nodded yes at which opening
were you

  third from mortons gate said
stuart weve talked it over together
you see and were both quite positive
about it each of those holes in the wall
is about two feet square a wooden bar
across each way sitting in the car we
could see through it nicely the inside
path was all visible

  and youre sure there was an open-
ing in the shrubs through which you
saw both men

  positive said parks we could see
them right between those two enormous
bunches of white oleanders-theyre in
bloom now as you probably know aft-
er peterson started out we saw dr mor-
ton standing there

  you might have mistaken someone
else for him

  in that gaudy dressing-gown not
much besides added stuart i knew
him well

  so that was that

bishop and i went out to the morton
house kathy was asleep i sent
bathsheba home then the chif and i
went over mortons study into which
the officer on guard had allowed no one

to come my first thought was for the
papers in the tin dispatch-box

  the box stood on the desk empty
what the hell did you expect
snapped bishop singleton was here
he did the job and he took the papers
sure according to what ive heard
from you he had sent them to morton
in the first place what we need to pin
the job on him is that letter morton
got

  i was somewhat staggered by the loss
of those documents however we went
at the job carefully the letter brought
morton by peterson had vanished it
was nowhere in the fireplace we found
a little pile of paper ash but it had been
stirred about so that no writing could
be brought up

  where had the drowning occurred
this was a puzzle the bathrooms
were spotless and had revealed no fin-
gerprints no abrasions on the tile-
nothing the washroom off the doc-
tors office gave no clue whatever

  well were doing a damned poor job
of detecting exclaimed the chief
dropping at long last on the couch in
the study either he was drowned
somewhere else or this singleton is too
damned clever for us

  what about jessop i said we
havent looked in his place yet always
a chance

there was a light in jessops rooms
at our knock he admitted us fright
was in his peering bircllike face

  you might be able to help us a bit
mr jessop said the chief heartily

i hope so i hope so exclaimed jes-
sop hastily we must stop all this
stop it stop it before it goes farther
his agitation was evident bishop
shot me a glance and i took the word

 what do you mean jessop you
think therell be another murder
theres bound to be he replied
they go by threes you know they do
its terrible mr bodham i cant stand
it-my nerves are all gone to pieces
no wonder said bishop ive
meant to ask you  few things this mur-
der drove em out of my head about
mrs welson she told us some interest-
ing things about you jessop very inter-
esting things that is about you and
young devry

  jessop was backed against the wall
staring at us his hands shaking

  i-ill tell you all about it he said
jerkily his voice thick with terror she
death on the doorstep

-she was not to blame she knew noth-
ing about it i can tell you the whole
thing i wanted to do it before and was
afraid i knew youd trace it to me ill
tell you everything you want to know
oh i said and hid my astonish-
ment with a laugh i suppose you can
tell us who john singleton is eh

  yes sir said jessop turning to me
yes of course i am

chapter eleven

despite my bewildered amazement
over jessops staggering disclosure
i could not but admire bishops tech-
nique he had the psychology of the
little secretary figured exactly right

  the name of mrs welson was to
jessop like a brick heaved into a plate-
glass window and had about the same
result he swallowed all that bishop
said he doubted nothing he was flung
into an agony of emotion from which
bfshop with almost hypnotic smooth-
ness extracted every thing desired the
weak frustrated helpless little man was
a pitiable object the idea that he was
blamed for nat devrys death had shat-
tered him

  jessop held nothing back apparently
he had in a word found nat devry
lying half in and half out of the tiny
creek near mrs welsons house between
two and three oclock

  and how did you happen to be there
at that time of the morning

  i was worried about mrs welson
she and i have been seeing a lot of each
other-i guess you know that if shes
told you- jessop paused and licked
his lips miserably i was worried
devryd been drunk early that evening
when he stopped to see the doctor
you mean that young devry came to
mortons house the night he was killed
before he went to the araby place
yes i wouldnt let him see dr
morton he wanted some medicine for
his heart he said he was going to see
a girl he had the key to mrs welsons
house and said she had let him use it
while she was out of town finally he
went away i worried and could not
sleep i was afraid hed get mrs welson
into some trouble about two oclock i

got up dressed and went to the welson
house his car was in front-

  briefly he had found devrys body
thought him still alive and drove him
out to mortons place in the mercedes
a double motive-to save his beloved
mrs welson from scandal and to save
devry the latter was quite dead how-
ever and jessop realized it upon reach-
ing mortons place this flung him into
fresh terror

  all i could think of he chattered
on was to make it look like a natural
death in fact i thought it was he was
all mud-splashed and wet i found a bag
in the car with clean clothes and got
them on him his old clothes are in the
bag now its here under my bed i
dragged him up the walk and left him
i didnt know until today that hed been
murdered i thought it was his heart
you arranged his body in the sign
of death i said jessop gave me a look
and ducked his head

  yes it-it was too good a chance to
lose i thought nobody but dr morton
would notice the position thats why i
was worried when you called me and i
saw the arm had been moved i moved
it back again before the doctor came
out well today-what andrey said-it
frightened me

  tell us urged bishop

  dr morton sent me to get the mail
at one oclock and ordered me not to
come back until after two

  morton did why

  essop shook his head

  i had no idea i was afraid to ask
questions he had a queer nervous
manner i went in town got the mail
went to mrs welsons house and she
wasnt there so i waited on the porch
till two oclock and then came back here
and went to my room i heard the front
bell ringing and went around the side of
the house loren andrey and his chauf-
feur were at the door he said that dr
morton had phoned for him to come as
a witness to a meeting with singleton
singleton you can imagine how i felt
then he told me that devrys death had
been murder miss devry had told him
about it everything was jumpy inside
of me then andrey went away almost
at once miss morton and andreas came
home and found the doctor dead and i
phoned for dr gregg

  he ended abruptly what were you
going to say i asked something
frightened you
the blue book magazine

  iessop swallowed hard thats it
oever did the murder knows about
me knows about singleton

  that was more than i did but i kept
quiet jessop was spilling everything he
went to his bureau and took out a folded
paper brought it to his table between
us and unfolded it within were two
playing cards-the seven of hearts and
the jack of clubs jessop pointed to the
latter card which was badly crumpled

  that was in the clenched hand of
devry when i found him he said it
fell out and i saved it i handled it but
i didnt handle this seven of hearts this
card was in dr mortons hand when i
went to him and found him dead
and you said nothing of it you con-
cealed it from us all cried bishop

poor jessop actually cringed yes
yes dont you see i was afraid
i didnt know what the first one meant
but this made it all clear to me and i
had just learned that the other was
murder-

  made what clear snapped bishop
what do these cards mean

  singleton i put in

  jessop gave me a birdlike nod

  yes a play on the name any bridge-
player would know someone knows
that i am singleton the murderer
knows you see hes trying to cast sus-
picion on me i am singleton but i had
no engagement with dr morton today
someone else-the one who murdered
him i had to tell you gentlemen to
save myself from this fiend-

  then youre the singleton who sent
all those letters and warnings i asked
yes mr bodham

  where are they did you take them
from the box in mortons study
yes he quavered i have them
here all safe they are mine after all
i havent been trying to hide anything
he burst forth desperately i just didnt
know what to do i was afraid

  bishop soothed him as by magic lit a
cigar and jessop became more calm

  i was trying to force dr morton to
tell the world the truth about my father
he said that was all you see single-
ton is really my name my fathers name
just where is it tangled up in the
devry family then i demanded

  john singleton was my father he
deserted my mother when i was a baby
took all her money and disappeared as
a boy i vowed to discover him and make
him repay all the pain and suffering

caused her as i grew up i devoted my-
self to this task it became the one
object of my life i learned that he had
presumably gone to china i went there
i traced hugh march easily but not
john singleton-

ah the exclamation burst from
me hugh march was your father
jessop regarded me with staring eyes
i have never got legal proof of it mr
bodham i tried to force dr morton to
publish all i did obtain

  did you threaten his life broke in
bishop suddenly

  yes jessop was becoming desperate
again but i would never have harmed
him never i only wanted to frighten
him into helping me

  with what object i drove in at him
mercilessly hugh march was dead
years ago your father took another
name and became nathaniel devry ii-
taking a third name you must have had
more of an objective than merely to
prove your birth legitimate

  wasnt that objective enough
snapped jessop waspishly the devrys
were realiy illegitimate-his marriage was
bigamous and i could legally claim

sart of the fortune my father made ite
ad stolen all my mothers money
chief bishop settled back satisfied
blackmail eh he grunted and chewed
anew at his cigar i knew it was more
than that i could understand jessop
better he answered perfectly to all the
built-up psychology i had identified with
singleton

  who else knows that youre single-
ton i asked quietly

  no one not a soul his answer
was so swift so positive it made me
wonder

  you understand i went on that
someone evidently posing as singleton
had an appointment with dr morton-
and murdered him youve said yourself
that someone must know youre single-
ton must be trying to fasten the murder
upon you therefore youve confided the
secret to someone

i have not mr bodham he said

knew in this instant that he lied
behind the thick lenses his eyelids
twitched in the slight involuntary mo-
tion that almost always accompanies a
lie whom had he told then i knew
the answer of course the woman to
whom he was so absurdly devoted i
might have got it out of him had not
bishop intervened


death on the doorstep

  youve told somebody jessop said
the chief somebody knows about
singleton and that person is either the
murderer of dr morton or else knows
the murderer

  those words must have hammered in-
to jessops soul he flinchedi then his
voice firmed

  no gentlemen- ive told no one
someone else has heard about singleton
and suspects i am that man thats all
are you going to arrest jne

  no chief bishop chewing at his
cigar shook his head youre an ac-
cessory after the fact of devrys murder
but i dont think the county prosecutor
will go after you on that score i can
jail you on several charges but im not
after a record for jailing suspects i want
the man who killed dr morton-thats
all stay here in your own rooms to-
night keep your ears open give us any
help you can agreed

  of course said jessop warmly
bishops sympathetic friendliness had
quite won him you can count on me
for that i wouldnt let miss kathy be
hurt for the world

  what makes you think shell be
hutf said bishop quickly

  jessops eyes widened

  she was attacked only the other
night wasnt she

  right said the chief and we left

back in mortons library bishop gave
me a questioning look

  how much of that little rats yarn
do you believe

  most of it i said

  you dont think miss morton will be
in any danger

  that was exactly what i did think
jessops final words had jerked at my
memory i recalled what miss devry had
said she had begged that kathy be pro-
tected in a few words i told bishop the
truth of kathys heritage he whistled

  may not be anything to it i went
on but young devry was killed then
morton and apparently an attempt was
made on kathy if its a question of the
devry fortune then the murderer is go-
ing to wipe kathy out be sure of it
okay then well act on that basis
said bishop promptly me i pick
jessop for the fall guy thats why i
left him at liberty so hed tip his mitt
tonight if hes not the one then the
other one may do the same can you
stay here tonight

  sure

  then go home go to bed and sneak
back here you may be watched never
can tell slip into the house and remain
in this room ill send my man away
and have him slip back later on and
wait in the garden near jessops place
your sister had better stay in the room
with miss morton sound reasonable
i assented but we must have some
regular guards by tomorrow theres no
question of expense

  if we havent got this thing licked by
tomorrow bishop said grimly im go-
ing to begin tossing suspects behind the
bars thats where the suspicion charge
in california helps the right people

we did the thing in style leaving
bathsheba to occupy the couch in
kathys room bishop sent his man away
with ostentation presently he and i
with banging of doors and heavy tread
left the house and went out to his police
car and stood talking loudly for a mo-
ment it was fantastic to imagine that
this desert solitude with the town lights
glinting along the slopes of the moun-
tains and the coyotes howling some-
where across the far foothills could
spawn any creature that might be spying
upon us fantastic but-

  see you tomorrow then called
bishop and went roaring away down the
highway toward town i crossed over to
my own cottage there with all the
solemnity of one who suspects an audi-
ence of his most private movements j
got into my pajamas and went to bed-
i never left out a motion absurd as it
might seem

  then in slippers and dark dressing-
gown i became a furtive plotter and
slunk out to the road and across it was
damned silly all of it or so i very frank-
ly thought at the moment mortons
door had been left unlocked andreas
was in bed i slipped in like a shadow
reached the library and stretched out
on the couch

  the problem of this murder was suf-
ficient to keep me from sleeping i went
over it step by step testing every scrap of
information only to come up against a
stone wall now we had the details of
the morton skeleton the hugh march
affair and we even knew all about
singleton the entire family history of the
house of devry was open before us-and
still we knew absolutely nothing about
the murderer

  somewhere in this tangle of singleton
and devry and march i knew there


the blue book magazine

must beapatent open clue an explana-
tion must be under our very eyes
yet we had less in the way of suspects
hert than we had on the devry case
this struck me as curious it suggested
that the devry murder assuming it as
murder might have been done on the
spur of the moment but that the murder
of dr morton was the result of long
thought and careful planning the more
i thought about it the more i became
convinced of this

  the web of overlapping alibis hardly
seemed possible by chance alone rather
a puzzle had been deliberately created a
puzzle impossible of solution all ques-
tion of possible motive aside the alibi
matter was fascinating jessop had the
poorest alibi which argued well for his
contention that someone was trying to
throw suspicion upon him

   petersons alibi was so perfect as to in-
spire the singular possibility that it
might be the one to cover the actual
killing and yet-parks and stuart swore
positively that they had seen morton
alive in the garden after peterson left
him they had departed at two oclock
and we had the unshakable testimony
of miss devrys electric clock that mor-
ton had called her at three minutes past
two-three minutes after peterson and
the other two men drove away

  the windows were open from afar
came the barking of dogs and the yap-
ping ululation of coyotes answering the
challenge with their insane voices it was
the nightly chorus of pine springs oldest
inhabitants leaving the couch i stepped
to the window the starlight outside was
obscure the garden was silent peterson
in the garden true he had been with
morton in plain sight from the car yet
the possibility fascinated me

  suppose i were peterson and peter-
son the murderer how could he have
killed the old doctor let alone drown
him while walking up and down in the
garden a confederate yes then how the
devil did the confederate get away and
where to one could only leave by the
highway or by the open desert running
across to the dude ranches and the town
buildings and anyone legging it across
that desert would have been observed

this got me nowhere i went to the
chair by the desk and sank into it
it was this chair in which i had sat
while morton told about singleton in
the darkness i could fancy him in his
own chair leaning on his right elbow

looking at me with that gentle but direct
stare of his it stirred something in my
subconscious memory rising i went to
the door and swung around as though
entering

  i remembered how morton had greet-
ed me turning to his own chair beckon-
ing me to come around the desk and sit
beside him something odd about it-
what why the chair of course odd
that the chair for a visitor or secretary
was at his right side at his left it would
have been several feet nearer the door
why make jessop or a visitor walk alb
the way around the long flat-top desk

  the explanation came with a rush i
recalled his manner-why it was ob-
vious of course morton had been deaf
in his left ear he must have kept it
rather secret perhaps had been sensitive
about it i could check on this with
kathy or jessop-

  at this instant i became conscious of
the purring pulse it was a faint throb
from somewhere outside very faintly
like the throb of a far-distant engine or
an idling motor

  then definitely i heard the creak of
the small garden gate by the garage

  i reached out to the desk flashlight
and pistol lay there ready to hand once
more i froze watching the garden every
sense fastened on that path on the side of
the house bushes and oleanders were
dense with shadow in the starlight

silence the pulsing throb contin-
ued softly someone had come in by
that gate was in the garden now leaving
a car outside tense i waited mentally
counting the paces of one coming from
that garden gate around to the front of
the house moments passed no light
showed fifty paces-sixty still i heard
nothing the shadows remained blank
sixty paces would have brought the in-
truder around past me to the front-ah
the garden gate again creaked had the
intruder departed

  so it seemed i regretted now that i
had not used the flashlight instead of
waiting for him to come close the
throbbing pulse of the motor quickened
slightly then died away and was gone
whoever had come was now departed

  what did it all mean upon me crept
an eerie sense of unreality of uncanny
action that could not be real dr morton
had died in this very room i remem-
bered the old stoutly held theory that
the spirit of one departed lingers about
the spot for days a chill seized me


death on the doorstep

   then suddenly a car turned from the
 highway into our little side road its
 headlights flared along the garden wall
 it halted before the garage gate a flash-
 ing radiance came through the gate four
 persons two of whom held flashlights
 entered bishop two of his officers-and
 a prisoner

  j

chapter twelve

 bishop brought his prisoner to the
 front i let them into the house and
 turned on the lights and we assembled
 in the front room the prisoner was
 peterson-calm pallid sharp and deep
 of eye perfectly composed

   we found mr peterson driving
 without any lights said bishop fling-
 ing me a wink here mr peterson
 come over to this table empty your
 pockets if you please

    youve no right to take this action
  snapped peterson but rather with firm
  poise than anger i thought this is an
  outrage whether youre police or not

	ive told you that i came here to have
 a word with mr jessop

    yes said bishop so you came and
 ffrent with no lights on your car-
 hello i exclaimed you mean
 peterson was the one who was here i
 heard someone come in-why he must
 have left his car idling in the road
 right the first time said the chief
 sneaked in and sneaked out-why
 thats what were going to learn all
 right peterson empty your pockets
 with a lofty and rather superior
 smile peterson obeyed the chief whis-
 pered to one of his officers who went
 out then turned to the others and waved
 his hand at peterson

   all right joe take him into the
 hall thats a good light frisk him to
 the skin and pay special attention to the
 shoes

   alone with me bishop stirred the
 plunder on the table with a long fore-
 finger grimaced and gave me a look

    i thought we had a fish bodham not
  so sure nothing here did he come into
  the house

    not near it i said i heard the gate
  creak twice thats all

    think he went to jessops
  absolutely not i was listening close-
  ly-thought he was coming around to the
  front if hed stepped to the door of that
  shack let alone knocked at it id have
  heard him

  bishop grunted i sent one lad out to
search his car and to search the road
where we picked him up in case he
threw something out what the devil
was he doing here

 you ought to know you grabbed
him

 yah we followed him out from
town the lad shadowing mrs wel-
sons house saw him come down there
then drive away after a few minutes the
shadow called me we followed and out
here saw his lights wink off he ducked
into this road we eased along waited
and nabbed him when he came back-
still without lights

  i examined the material on the table
tried to read some sinister meaning into
the stuff and found it impossible a
wallet a cigarette packet a booklet of
matches a handsome lighter loose bills
and coins a key-ring a scarlet silk hand-
kerchief a fine linen handkerchief of
white two letters containing duns

  joe brought peterson back into the
room with a negative shake of the head

  do you mind i asked him telling
us what you discussed with jessop

  i didnt discuss anything peterson
stated calmly his place was dark and
this house was dark i realized it was a
bit late and went back to my car and
drove off meaning to come back tomor-
row

  oh i see thats quite natural i
said and the car lights

  peterson shrugged i really cant say
-just one of those things we do mr
bodham we all do things which wed
find difficult to explain now and then
true i said too true in fact
and what had you in mind to say to
jessop

  purely a personal matter said pe-
terson quietly if im arrested gentle-
men i want to know it i insist that
you place me in jail and take the conse-
quences when my attorney goes to work
if not arrested i want to know it

v oure not arrested said bishop

  i but maybe you will be driving
within city limits with no lights-dont
get gay mr peterson i can jail you in
a flash put away your stuff well take
care of it at headquarters if i keep you
there

  peterson i thought was insufferably
sure of himself he tucked the red silk
handkerchief into the breast pocket of
his trimly cut coat rammed the linen
handkerchief on top of it and pocketed


the blue book magazine

his other things chief bishop motioned
his officer

  joe go fetch that man jessop and
dont make any noise coming in

  joe departed i lit a cigarette and
studied peterson who had coolly taken
a chair he too had lighted a cigarette
and he eyed us with defiance then he
flicked his ashes to the floor-and the
gesture startled me

  this servile soft-spoken nonentity
who so humbly obeyed miss devrys
lightest word-why was he so defiant so
coolly scornful the answer came with
a jolt he was nothing of the sort he
was putting on a frantic act actually
he was in deathly fear-but of what

  satisfied of this however i tried to
put my finger on another false note
somewhere about him-manner dress
words it eluded me i sensed some-
thing wrong but could not pin it down

  jessop was brought in and bishop in-
dicated peterson

  mr jessop do you know this man
  i believe its mr peterson

  do you know him

ive never met him said jessop
though ive seen him more than once
have you any idea why he would be
bringing you a personal and important
message at this time of night

  the surprise evinced by jessop was i
thought genuine

  why of course not he rejoined
  bishop glanced at peterson

  well nows your chance jessops
here anything you want to say to him
peterson retained his lofty disdainful
air and made no response

  so you lied to us went on bishop
well ill give you a chance to come
clean why were you here

  ive told you said peterson make
the most of it

he was not afraid now why more
and more i was convinced that the
answer was in plain sight-where was the
false note as though to emphasize his
returning confidence peterson went on
its nonsense to talk of holding me
for driving with no lights and you know
it thats not a felony many a man
forgets to switch on his lights youre
all worked up over the murder of dr
morton and i dont blame you let
me advise you however not to let it
carry you too far-

  suddenly i leaped to my feet

  they all stared at me bishop on
whom petersons words were making a

definite impression turned a troubled
face to me i stepped up to peterson
yes i had it now-the white linen hand-
kerchief on top of the other one
what is it demanded the chief
notice anything wrong about peter-
sons appearance i said    no you
wouldnt nor would i just now he was
clever enough to cover up the evidence

peterson eyed me in obviously
alarmed suspicion i reached forward
quickly before ik could stop me i
jerked the linen handkerchief from his
breast pocket and with it the red silk
handkerchief he made one convulsive
grab and then relaxed as i stepped back
i tossed the linen handkerchief at hi
and he caught it watching me sullenly

  bishop notice that even now mr
peterson is attired with care and pre-
cision i said hes the soul of mild
propriety he dresses impeccably and
conservatively what then is he doing
with a gaudy scarier silk handkerchief-
a nice big one such as might be worn
with a rodeo shirt by our resorters from
brooklyn its completely out of charac-
ter he would never think of wearing
this handkerchief which doesnt match
his clothes or his personality come
peterson why were you carrying this
handkerchief

  youre right he fairly snarled i
wouldnt be found dead with that rag in
my pocket

  then why was it in your pocket
it wasnt its an old tom handker-
chief that was in the car-where it came
from i dont know he retorted with
a sneer look under the seat youll
find one or two more such rags i had
been using it to wipe the inside of the
windshield where the cold night air
condenses moisture

  bishops expression of hope and inter-
est died out into resignation petersons
words were convincing his explanation
was logical i was almost convinced my-
self-almost the question hit me how
death on the doorstep

had he known the handkerchief was
tom i glanced at it yes it was tom

  then i saw something else it was
not an old tom handkerchief it was a
new handkerchief newly torn it was
not a dirty rag it was clean i care-
fully folded it up and pocketed it and
nodded slowly peterson had come in-
to the garden-why he had sneaked
here sneaked out and away-why i
remembered how i had stood at the win-
dow counting those imaginary steps
sixty of them before the gate had
creaked for the second time sixty
that would be thirty from the gate
thirty back to the gate

  well i said and rose looks as if
weve been barking up the wrong tree
chief suppose we give our friends a
chance to smoke while you and i step
outside for a moment id like to look
at something

  bishop followed me outside at my
request he handed me his flashlight and
i led him around the side of the house

  looked like you had something
there for a minute he said with
that handkerchief

  i had and i still have but i dont
want peterson to realize it i replied
hes a damned clever man you watch
out for him keep him locked up
eh whats the answer what have
you on him

  cant tell you that dont know my-
self as yet now wait here

  i went on to the rear gate from it i
stepped thirty paces-average walking
paces-toward the front of the house
along the path i halted and as i
brought up the flashlight my arm was
brushed by lantana stalks-the lantanas
were trained up about the base of a
clump of oleanders

the light struck upon the vivid clus-
ter of flowers with their fuzzy spiny
branches and leaves the light settled
my eyes focused i called bishop he
joined me and i pointed to something

  it was a mere shred a tiny shred of
crimson silk where the handkerchief
had caught i detached it carefully

  whats it mean demanded bishop
was he walking along here

  ask me something easy chief i
said no he came back here tonight
to get something-this handkerchief
whats the answer i dont know but
ill find out take him in and try to
break him down tomorrow about this
handkerchief

  all right if you say so said the
chief rather dubiously but im go-
ing to be busy as hell tomorrow-got a
few things to run down may take me
clear to roydron

  no hurry i said remembering that
young devry was to be cremated on the
morrow you can hold peterson i sup-
pose for a couple of days

  well i can if i must said bishop
to be honest bodham i cant quite
swallow this handkerchief stuff he
might have lost it when he was walking
about the garden with dr morton but
why would he come back for it in this
gumshoe manner

  thats precisely the interesting ques-
tion i said not daring to hint at the
tentative possibility in my mind

  and how went on the chief do
we know that he came back for it at all

its easily proved look and i
 flashed the beam of light along the
clipped grass that came up to the edge
of the path itself at this season the
dew is heavy you cant walk across this
thickly sown grass without leaving
streaks-see them

  plain enough someone had taken a
couple of steps from the path over to
the clump of oleanders with the lantana
bush about its base-someone approach-
ing it in the starlight from the direction
of the rear gate rather uncertainly

  none of us did that coming in you
didnt do it finding the shred of silk-
weve kept on this side there are the
streaks you made said bishop fetch
that light along and well look over his
car

  it was outside the gate with bishops
car the chief peered in and around
it and found nothing of interest in the
glove-compartment or elsewhere from
the floor in the rear he pulled up a lap-
robe and a water-canteen encased in felt
and was putting them back with a grunt
when i caught the canteen from him
and led the way along the house wall
to the window of dr mortons study
where i had found the scratches the
flashlight brought them out clearly
against them i fitted the canteen the
two rivets of the strap-clasp fitted them
exactly and bishop uttered a choked
oath

  whats it mean

  i dont know yet i said frankly
but i shall if a scraping of theadobe
reveals microscopic hairs of the felt
where someone holding the canteen


the blue book magazine

slung over his arm pressed it against the
adobe - then well know how the
scratches were made peterson there-
fore was the man listening at the win-
dow who hit kathy over the head
and why the devil would he have
been holding this canteen

  i dont know but i shall if those
rivet-heads show microscopic particles
of adobe adhering as they undoubtedly
will the proof will be conclusive bet-
ter hold peterson

  on what charge

  suspicion of mortons murder be-
fore you leave town in the morning
come over here early and ill show you
why he came back for that handker-
chief i hope bring stuart and parks
the two witnesses with you

 my lord man you mean to say
you can clear up the murder

  not yet chief tomorrow morning
ill show you a new version of the old
handkerchief trick when you get back
ill tell you how the murder was done
and who did it-with luck

  all right ill play ball with you
bishop said crisply only i hope to
hell youre not opening your mouth too
wide bodham

  so did i to tell the truth

chapter thirteen

on the following morning satur-
day i was up with the dawn and
across at mortons house

  bishops last words recurred to me as
i labored in effect i had opened my
mouth a bit too wide i could only trust
that my convictions were right and that
the solution of the handkerchief trick
might lead on to something more posi-
tive i believed that the canteen might
be a clue to the whole puzzle but it
eluded me

  pacing along through the grass watch
in hand measuring distances with care i
got my feet soaked in dew but things
were falling into shape when i went
to jessops house i knew just about what
i wanted to discover next

  thanks i wont come in i said
as he peered at me through the screen
just want you to help me a bit if you
will first was dr morton hard of
hearing

  yes he replied promptly he was
quite deaf in his left ear

  thats why the chairs were so ar-
ranged in his study

  yes he was sensitive about it did
not want it known at all said jessop
he would never let anyone sit or stand
on his left side if talking with him
however he managed it very adroitly
-he had been deaf in that ear since his
youth when he had scarlet fever-and
no one has ever suspected the fact

  i could have hugged the little rat but
refrained

 one thing more i said you
havent told me how dr morton was
dressed when he was found

  jessop ducked his head it was his
newest dressing-gown mr bodham-the
one he got for his birthday three weeks
ago sir it came from the sinologues
club in los angeles very handsome
too red-flowered silk brocade

 sinologues club i repeated
where is it in los angeles

  i dont know said jessop i never
heard of it before but the gown came
with birthday greetings and a card from
the sinologues club its not unusual
for dr morton to receive tokens of re-
spect and affection from such organiza-
tions or i should say it was not un
usual jessop added sadly

  wheres the dressing-gown now
  in the closet off his study sir

  all right thanks i rejoined and
plunged back into the house i was be-
ginning to get everything straight now

  andreas was getting breakfast i told
him bishop would be along kathy and
bathsheba were not yet awake then
getting the handkerchief taken from pe-
terson i started for the study closet

  i was practically certain of what i
would find petersons agitation about
that handkerchief his lies-all pointed
to one thing and so i found it the
flowered crimson dressing-gown was of
brocade silk-lined the material was
the exact shade and texture of the gown
lining probably there had been an en-
tire set-gown handkerchiefs and socks

chief bishop showed up with
word that the real-estate lads were
coming he joined me for a eup of cofc
fee and eyed me quizzically

  well bodham have you solved the
great mystery

  some of it i said the rest is just
around the corner

  whistling to keep your courage up
eh he said smiling i didnt say any-
thing about it last night but you were
all wet about petersons careful dressing
why when he was here with stuart and


death on the doorstep

parks to see morton he was wearing a
green golf jacketl

  i stared at him he was by thun-
der chief that may be important
hello-here are our witnesses now i
want you to play morton ill play peter-
son

  i met the two real-estate men outside
and they put their car exactly where it
had been so they could see through the
wall-opening into the garden i noted
that it gave a view of the lantana just
beyond which chief bishop was waiting
he called and waved i responded
went around by the garden gate and
joined him

three and one-half minutes later i
came back to the car stuart drove it
down to the gate halted it then with his
partner accompanied me to whsre bish-
op was standing on the path he eyed
them rather skeptically

 well what did you boys see
through the peep-hole

  why nothing special said parks
we saw you and mr bodham walk
back and forth among the trees just the
way we saw peterson and dr morton
jvalking yesterday

  thats right assented stuart smil-
ing just what were we supposed to
see

  bishop swallowed hard gave me a
look and then nodded genially

  well thanks a lot he said in dis-
missal thanks for coming out you
saw only what you were supposed to see
naturally may want you again later in
the day

  they departed promising to keep the
little experiment secret when their
car had gone bishop looked at me and
grunted

  well it worked id never have be-
lieved it

  all right i said heres something
more see if it suggests anything to you
dr morton was stone deaf in his left
ear he never let anyone walk or sit
on his left

  bishop whistled softly scratched his
chin and slowly shook his head

  well its a cute little handkerchief
trick like you said you go ahead and
crack this case bodham youre start-
ed on it keep at it me ive got some-
thing else to do peterson is a smart
hombre like you said he had an alibi
for the night of young devrys murder

  yes i prompted as he paused he
shook his head grinning faintly

  you stick to the morton case bod-
ham give me the devry case for a
change this is a honey this alibi itll
blow off a couple of lids if true now
im off for roydron may get back to-
night may not ive got several things
to take up with the sheriff down there
you going to be around town

  so far as i know not i rejoined
before i can get any farther with this
thing i must go in to los angeles ill
do that today may take bathsheba in
and spend the evening and make up
some of the sleep ive lost

  bishop grunted and turned to his
car half the town going to l a to-
day looks like say mortons death is
known by now couldnt keep it dark
any longer in an hour or so youll
have a flood of newspaper men here
better take both girls away somewhere
he departed waving farewell ex-
cellent advice i reflected and entering
the house found bathsheba and kathy
up and at the breakfast table

  when i explained what sort of ordeal
they were facing they were instantly for
adopting bishops scheme and going
to los angeles with me then kathy
exclaimed in dismay

  but we must see miss devry she
called up a few minutes ago tom said
shed be here in half an hour-that she
wanted to see me before she started for
the funeral

  i went to the telephone got miss dev-
ry and knowing what she wanted to say
to kathy arranged the whole matter in
two minutes we would meet her at
the mission inn in riverside en route
to los angeles all very simple

 hustled the girls with their pack-
ing got them into my car and we
were off kathy was pretty well over the
worst of the shock having bathsheba on
hand was a great help

  as for myself i had certain things to
do in los angeles-and if they turned
out as i hoped they would i would have
the most essential part of the morton
mystery solved

  and as we sped toward riverside i
simply could not resist one temptation
miss devry would want to tell kathy
the truth in her own fashion that was
all very nice but after all tom bodham
had a reputation to sustain in a gals
eyes therefore i determined to sustain
it and to thunder with miss devry

  so i beat the old dowager to the gun
and told kathy who she was




the blue book magazine

chapter fourteen

so great was the hue and cry in the
press when the story of the mortons
and the devrys and the murder and all
the rest of it was broadcast in every scan-
dal sheet that kathy actually lacked the
nerve to return home at once and face
it nor did i blame her bathsheba
came to bat and offered to stay with
kathy in los angeles until dr mortons
funeral was over this would release
me and after the funeral kathy could
face the ordeal of the press

  i drove back on monday by myself to
pine springs i lunched en route drove
on through town without stopping and
reached home about one-thirty congratr
ulating myself that i had arrived unseen

  i reckoned without my police chief
barely was i settled at the typewriter
when the phone summoned me

  so you thought youd sneak into
town and evade me huh bishop said
blithely im ready for a showdown
if you are how did your case break
ah broken down and ready to go
but not to trial i replied im
stumped by the fact that morton phoned
miss devry at precisely three minutes
past two it cant be shaken its too
perfect had it occurred to you that the
clock might have been tampered with
thats possible yes rejoined bish-
op if so it would throw out a thing
or two but we cant prove it dobbs
went over the clock no prints on it at
all its a big old-time clock one of the
first electrics no prints on it at all but
wait i got an idea about that bodham
leave it in my hands for a while now
forget it i want to see you and jessop
if youll meet me over at mortons house
in twenty minutes

  all right i said

  before you come type out the line
of stuff youre going to show on mortons
death are you sure of it all
absolutely

  then type out the thing in brief to
serve as confession weve got to jump
a ways on this ive uhearthed the
damnedest stuff you ever heard of and
as soon as we get through with jessop
wed better pile right back here and
turn on the heat for a confession

  i had the morton case in shape at
least that is in shape except for any
motive and one or two other minor
points including legal proof however
my interest lies in solving a case not in
hanging a man



  so i typed out a form of confession
that covered all i hoped to prove and
did it rather cynically a really good
mouthpiece can beat out a witnessed
confession with ease putting it in my
pocket i went over to the morton house
and found jessop at work in the study
apparently as though nothing had hap-
pened before we had more than ex-
changed greetings chief bishop arrived

  youre going to be interested he
said you know where mrs welson
your lady friend was the night nat dev-
ry was killed jessop 

  why-why yes quavered jessop
at roydron at the hotel there
yes and you werent with her but
peterson was shot out the chief he
had a swell alibi-a swell one-he was in
his wifes arms he and mrs welson
have been married for several years

if this astonished me it absolutely
staggered poor jessop the acute mis-
ery of his tortured face its stricken dis-
may would have touched a heart of stone

  and you went on chief bishop
blabbed to the lady she played you
for a sucker and you fell for it nqv
bodham-and he turned to me-that
dame is the sister of loren andrey sav-
vy ive cracked em wide open-all ex-
cept peterson and listen to what our
jessop yonder fell into like a sap

  he began to tick off the names on his
fingers andrey and his sister were
lousy remnants of a good family raised
to money but lacking any plenty of that
type around these days peterson and
the sister married then schemed to get
loren andrey married to the devry
girl they got that done rather pe-
terson got it done bodham you must
understand that neither mrs welson
as you know her nor loren andrey are
criminal types theyre weak foolish
out for blackmail or easy money-noth-
ing worse and now if you two gents
will hop in my car well go down to
headquarters

  headquarters jessop let out a
squawk why

  because a reception committee is
gathering there right now in my private
office said bishop and grinned in-
cluding the county prosecutor were
going to clear up the devry murder in
jig time then you bodham are going
to clear up the morton murder-or are
you

  i drew a deep breath chief after
what youve just told me i have every-
death on the doorstep

 thing that motive angle and time ele-
 ment were what queered me i gather
 that youre about to prove a motive
 boy ill prove anything you want to
 name but lets get going

   having shot his wad and gained his
 effect bishop was now in a rush to get
 us back to his office i tried to make
 him tell me who had murdered devry
 and he refused pointblank as we got
 into the car jessop paused and faced
 the chief anger in his eyes

   is that true he cried in a shrill
 voice what you told me about their
 being married theyre not separated
 bishop laughed devil a bit theyve
 kept it quiet even secret you spilled
 everything to the dame and she passed
 it on to the others so they knew you
 were singleton and who morton really
 was-anyhow this last they had learned
 already-

   all right broke out jessop and
 climbed in all right ill tell you
 plenty when it comes time i tried to
 shield her but now ill tell plenty
 okay the chief was sliding un-
 der the wheel and tipped me a wink
 okay the time is just ahead of you
 mr jessop lets go

 	go we did twenty minutes later we
 i were entering police headquarters by
 the rear entrance bishop said with a
 chuckle that he had drawn all the flies
 to the honey out in front by announc-
 ing that the storys break was imminent

 jessop was taken in by an officer
 bishop paused and gripped my arm
 got that confession written out
 good were playing along two lines
 remember-you on t he morton angle me
 on the devry case ill take mine first
 and mind this ive got the room rigged
 with dictaphones dont need any stenos
 its being transcribed elsewhere see
 one thing more dobbs is on an errand
 that may throw some light on the time
 angle so puzzling to us if it does ill
 hand you the results pronto hes not
 finished yet all set then come on ill
 go into it slap-bang

   officers and deputy sheriffs were scat-
 tered all over the place we entered the
 chiefs private office ancl found it well
 filled peterson satt here frowning a
 guard at his elbow mrs welson-or
 mrs peterson-sat with loren andrey
 and mrs andrey at one side sat miss
 devry she barely nodded to me jessop
 sat by himself also looking like a vin-
 dictive wasp hovering and readying to

strike beside the desk was the county
prosecutor winred

   bishop slid into his seat and spoke
      most abruptly

     mr winred you can decide what
   action to take after we finish this private
   hearing this man peterson is charged
   with suspicion of murdering dr david
   morton for the moment im passing
   up this charge which will be handled
   by mr thomas bodham im going to
   charge peterson with the murder of na-
   thaniel devry iv peterson youre not
   compelled to speak anything you may
   say will be used against you

      peterson struck a match lit a cigarette
    and regarded bishop with a sneer

     your absurdity is becoming insan-
   ity bishop you know perfectly well
   that on the night nat died i was a hun-
   dred and twelve miles away there are
   two people who can prove it and he
   flipped his thumb toward loren andrey
   and mrs welson

      lets talk about that said bishop
   easily mr andrey and his sister who
   is your wife you kept the fact secret
   why because youve built up a great
   campaign ever since the day you discov-
   ered the will of miss edna devry and
   what was to become of her fortune it
   told you who dr morton really was
   and you went to work you didnt take
   these two dupes into your confidence
   however you got andrey married to
   miss frances devry-and heres the nub
   of the whole thing peterson if the
   bulk of the devry fortune came to mrs
   andrey or even half of that fortune
   there was plenty for everybody plenty
   to go around

      peterson laughed softly now youre
   getting fantastic chief you start on an
   alibi and you end up in the moon
   merely to show motivation mr pe-
   terson as for the alibi you and your
   wife did drive to roydron that day so
   did loren andrey you left here at five
   and got there at eight registering at the
   hotel andrey kicked up a bit of trou-
   ble over his room demanded it be
   changed acted in a rather objectionable
   manner why to make sure his alibi
   and yours would be thoroughly estab-
   
the blue book magazine

lished then the two of you slipped out
and drove back here

  let me knock all this nonsense out
at one crack said peterson with lofty
disdain it can be found that we did
no such thing very simply my car was
garaged at roydron it wasnt used
until i returned here next morning no
doubt the others were also

  no doubt agreed bishop with his
cherubic smile you even had your
car greased that night wheels and all
the odd thing is mr peterson that an
eastern geologist named allan brent
turned up in roydron a couple of
weeks ago and bought a secondhand car
i have here full details on the car it
was left in roydron garaged not used
until the night nat devry was killed
then mr allan brent showed up about
nine oclock with a friend and took the
car out he returned around five
oclock in the morning put up the car
left instructions that it be sold and that
he would call in a couple of weeks for
the money and departed he was so
sure of himself that he left plenty of fin-
gerprints on the steering-wheel and door
panel and theyre your fingerprints
peterson

during this speech peterson had
lost his smile his frown returned
he stared doggedly at bishop and said
nothing but andrey suddenly came to
his feet

  this is all absolute nonsense he
exploded violently bishop youre
charging me and my sister with all sorts
of crimes and ill not stand it if you
have any charge against me i demand
that you arrest me and prove everything
openly

  bishop smiled good bluff andrey
if mr winred so decides well do just
that you dont have to stay if you dont
want to hear whats going on after all
i dont think yoh or your sister would
have gone in for murder you didnt
know what peterson planned you
thought that your share was merely to
hide in the house and get some camera
shots of young devry in a compromising
situation-blackmail was all right in
your opinion sit down

  andrey swallowed hard and sat down
blinking peterson was watching bishop
now watching him narrowly and with
a tense concentration upon miss dev-
rys bony features framed in her black
veil rested a shadowy smile as though
she were enjoying herself

   my wife spoke out peterson abrupt-
ly can destroy this fanciful story and
fake fingerprints youve built up she
 knows that i was with her all night

bishop beamed good man peter-
son youd even go to that extent
eh but i doubt whether a court would
accept your wifes testimony without a
grain of salt and- he paused sud-
denly and glanced at mrs welson-peter-
son who sat with an expression of hor-
rified fear and in fact your wife has
already confessed the intention regard-
ing blackmail she rightly considered it
better to do so than be charged with
murder

   there was an instant sensation pe-
terson swore luridly jumped up and
was shoved back in his seat by his guard

   bishop went on hurriedly

   now lets get it over peterson you
got back here planted andrey in the
welson house left him to do the trick-
but you knew nat devry would never
come in that house later you rushed
in dragged andrey out and got him in-
to your car telling him nat had been
killed-and you both rushed back to
roydron -right mr andrey

   andrey went from red to white

   careful hes trying to make you
admit you were on the spot when nat
died peterson snapped

   quite needless peterson said bish-
 op blandly suppose we take up your
 feelings when you heard of the body hav-
 ing been found on dr mortons door-
 step you were worried you couldnt
 understand it you dont understand it
 now because you still dont know who
 saw you drown young devry and the
 reason which led that witness to cover
 you up no longer exists-does it mr
 jessop	v

   bishop knew his business it was beau-
 tifully done even jessop was taken
 off guard

   no it doesnt he cried out vindic-
 tively i risked a lot to help you he
 added glaring at mrs welson but
 now ill tell the truth you deceived
 me

   which is putting it mildly observed
 the chief mr jessop had worried
 about what might happen at the welson
 house that night he came down to
 hang around-he was very deeply infat-
 uated and acted like any other man in
 love he carried off the body of devry
 so that the woman he loved would not
 receive blame or scandal
death on the doorstep

   peterson burst out in swift words
 shaking his hand at jessop

   then you know if you were there
 you know it was accidental you know
 it was not murder i didnt lay a hand
 on him he tripped over that water-
 channel-i never touched him

    except to hold his head down in the
 water until he drowned said bishop
 coldly

    i expected jessop to confirm this ar-
 dently he did not he merely hung his
 head and looked down at his nervously
 twisting hands then i perceived the
 weak spot in bishops chain of evi-
 dence jessop would have spoken quick-
 ly enough had he seen the actual deed
 that spoke up peterson is a lie
 i didnt touch him and you cant prove
 i did

    youll discover what proof we have
 later on if mr winred presses this
 charge said bishop now i think
 that cleans up the mystery of devrys
 murder fylr bodham and i have
 worked on this whole affair together
 and ive left to him the question of dr
 mortons murder-ah one moment
 please come in dobbs

    he turned as the fingerprint expert
  came in extending to him several
 blown-up prints and then departing
 bishop glanced at the sheets and passed
 them over to me in silence as i saw
 what they were incredulity and exulta-
 tion sent my blood leaping

    all right mr bodham said bishop
  i was conscious of petersons gaze fas-
  tened upon me a gaze of fear and an-
  ger and dread suspense the mans
  defenses had been broken down but he
  was still capable of fight

   peterson murdered dr morton i
 said letting him have both barrels at
 the start he left an alibi so perfect
 that it would have disproved any such
 charge had it not been broken down
 -and i tapped the photographs just
 arrived the hypothetical murderer
 must have killed dr morton after the
 visit of peterson and the two realtors
 these gentlemen had seen dr morton
 alive-or thought they had-after peter-
 son left him and this would automati-
 cally disprove any charge that peterson
 had murdered him if true

 winred spoke up with abrupt dis-
     approval of my words

    mr bodham ive gone over the testi-
  mony those gentlemen are reputable
  theyve sworn to what they saw

   to what they thought they saw i
 corrected him as you know mr pros-
 ecutor no one is infallible on the witness
 stand let me tell you what actually hap-
 pened morton was in his garden when
 the visitors hailed him from the road he
 waved to them peterson hopped out of
 the car and hurried to the gate and
 around to dr morton

   i paused peterson was hanging on
 my words with an agony of suspense in
 his eyes in the eyes of his wife the
 fake mrs welson was a deeper feel-
 ing-a cold and ghastly fear the fear of
 one who knows what is coming

   now i went on comes the one fact
 which has not yet been brought out and
 which will readily be proven that doc-
 tor morton as he walked down the path
 to meet peterson was no longer in sight
 of the two men in the car peterson
 knew it no words passed peterson
 struck the old man with the heel of his
 palm-a brutal blow to the point of the
 jaw but one to leave no outward bruise
 poor morton toppled over unconscious
 peterson lifted his frail body-and then
 drowned him	- 

 no wonder they all looked incredu-
 lous at this i was timing my dis-
 closures with the sole object of break-
 ing down petersons resistance bit by bit
 nothing else mattered he was my tar-
 get now if i could break down suffi-
 cient of his iron self-assurance then i
 would have him

   among the bushes i went on was
 an alabaster bird-bath long disused it
 was not within view of the two men in
 the car peterson had figured out the
 angles of vision very carefully on the
 previous night peterson had come here
 stopping up the bowl and filling the
 bath with water yes mr peterson we
 know all this i added as peterson
 made a strangled choking protest you
 struck miss morton over the head with
 your water-container the desert water-
 bottle carried in your car we first
 credited the blow to a flower-pot but
 that was no doubt an accidental upset
 a canteen on its strap makes a good
 weapon eh

   peterson sat like stone glaring at me
 i went on quietly

   you stripped off the scarlet dressing-
 gown morton was wearing you laid
 him face down his nostrils and lips
 buried in the water of the bowl leav-
 ing him to drown you walked back to
 the path where you came in partial view
 	x
the blue book magazine

of your two witnesses the shrubbery
nearly hiding you

  on one turn of the path you drew
the scarlet robe over your shoulder it
conveyed to the men in the car careless-
ly watching the notion that they saw
dr morton on the reverse turn you
showed the green merino golf jacket you
were wearing that was a false note
peterson being so far from your usual
garb but it was necessary you had to
wear something that would not be con-
fused in the eyes of the two witnesses
with the scarlet robe of dr morton
peterson rallied with a great effort
this is all sheer fabrication he de-
clared boldly youve built up a fan-
ciful story false in every detail to do
all that you claim i did would require
a great deal of time and the great
thing is that he was seen there alive
after i had left at two oclock he tele-
phoned miss devry after then he con-
cluded triumphantly

his words produced a great effect
even the impassive prosecutor was
watching me uncertainly but in the
eyes of irene peterson as she watched
me lingered that same horrible fear

  mr peterson i went on i did
everything i charge you with doing and
several more things in less than four
minutes i also fooled those two honest
witnesses just as you did and all i
used was chief bishops uniform jacket
over my sweat-shirt they believed they
had seen us both they were quite sin-
cere of course i not only did this but
took the necessary time to telephone-
as you telephoned

  as i did youre crazy shrilled pe-
terson wildly he was breaking fast

  no you telephoned miss devry
pretending to be morton you asked
her to send two witnesses and so forth
we neednt go into all that now for im
concerned with the clever timing of this
telephone call by miss devrys evi-
dence it was at precisely three minutes
past two-while we know positively that
you had left the morton grounds and
got into the car at two oclock sharp
thus you are definitely cleared of any
suspicion

  and spoke out miss devry with
acid gusto id like to see you break
down my testimony bodham just try
it that electric clock of mine is always
on the dotl

  she had asked for it and i let her
have it with a polite bow and a smile

and a wave of the hand toward the pho-
tos dobbs had just brought in

  quite so miss devry quite so yet
your testimony was most inaccurate
your electric clock is fastened on the
wall it is an early model and to set it
one opens the glass as in old-fashioned
clocks there were no fingerprints at
all upon this clock they had carefully
been wiped off but i added indi-
cating the photos again these enlarge-
ments show the prints which had been
neglected-prints from the inside of the
glass one set of prints made when
the clock was altered three minutes in
time another when the same person
returned and corrected the clock the
prints are those of peterson

  that got him a gasp escaped him
and he sagged in his chair

  nice i call it exclaimed bishop
nice how did you run down that
business about the red bathrobe

  dressing-gown i corrected him
the handkerchief gave the clue there
a nice red handkerchief some time
ago dr morton received a present a
handsome red dressing-gown from the
sinologues club of los angeles so
far as i can learn no such club exists
but the gown came from a well-known
haberdasher a man who at the proper
time will be identified as mr peterson
bought the gown and had it shipped
with the enclosed card to dr morton
a handkerchief matching it he kept out
for himself saying that only the gown
was desired he used the handkerchief
to hang on a lantana branch amid the
shrubbery after carrying dr morton in-
to the house to those sitting in the car
it seemed that they beheld morton him-
self seeing the color which they asso-
ciated with him it was natural that at
this distance they woidd suppose them-
selves looking at morton it was still
there when they all left therefore to
them they had seen morton after pe-
terson left him and this might have
remained unchallenged had peterson
risked leaving the scarlet handkerchief
there he decided not to take the risk
he came back at night and recovered
the handkerchief-and was lost

eterson made a frantic effort to
speak with his old assurance

  conjecture circumstantial pre-
sumptive evidence-all of it manufac-
tured to serve your endl

 i handed bishop the paper i had
typed to be signed


death on the doorstep

   one thing more you forget peter-
 son and thats the curious matter of the
 deaf man who heard you and only you
  that got his attention and the atten-
 tion of everyone else i paused and de-
 liberately struck off on a side trail of
 sheer conjecture

wou worked well peterson you
i phoned dr morton in the name of
singleton and made an appointment in-
sisting that he be alone you werent
courageous you wanted to kill only a
gentle old man who would be unable to
spoil your careful planning so more of
the devry fortune would go to mrs an-
drey probably miss morton would have
come next and then miss devry herself
but you forgot one damning thing the
deaf man who could hear only you
petersons face was ghastly

   when you wore the robe as morton
 you walked away from the house in
 your green jacket as yourself you
 walked toward the house you should
 have reversed this process if you wanted
 to escape conviction for murder peter-
 son you made your two witnesses see
 morton walk with his right side to the
 car and his left side to you thats the
 f mistake that will cost you your life for
 dr morton was stone deaf in his left
 ear and never sat or walked with any-
 one on that side of him

   that was a clincher weak and in-
 effectual as it really was as evidence it
 hit the imagination a buzz of exclama-
 tions broke out in the room peterson
 shrank back his eyes flinching

  and good old bishop who never
missed a trick stepped right up to bat

   look peterson weve got you cold
 dead cold he said in his cordial sym-
 pathetic way now heres a confes-
 sion regarding mortons murder if you
 sign it what happens youre no worse
 off while your wife and andrey are a
 jot better off being in the clear refuse
 to sign and we must charge them with
 complicity in nat devrys murder
 theyre actually accessories before the
 fact-unless you clear them by your con-
 fession-and theyll be tried for mortons
 murder as well

   i saw him exchange a glance a nod
 of understanding with the prosecutor
 then he went on swiftly shoving my
 typed paper and a pen at peterson

   here sign this confession regarding
 mortons murder where weve got you

 cold that of devry isnt entirely prov-
 en as murder yet the state may be
 willing to prosecute on the one charge
 alone though i offer nothing then
 your wife will be out of it im speak-
 ing as a friend peterson you know it
 peterson lowered his eyes to the paper
 and studied it for a moment then he
 lowered his face on his arms and re-
 mained motionless as though in hope-
 less indecision bishop beamed com-
 placently made a confident gesture and
 another for silence

  petersons head jerked up he looked
bishop in the eye for an instant nod-
ded and picked up the pen

  all right youve got me damn you
i suppose i must he said in surly
anger he poised the pen as though
to sign then glanced up at his wife
irene step into the telephone office
next door call up the attorney i told
you about in los angeles and tell him
to get out here and defend me

  the woman rose at once and started
out the officer at the door glanced at
bishop who gestured him not to in-
terfere and he allowed her to pass

  peterson read the confession through
carefully and at length affixed his signa-
ture which was notarized on the spot

the crowd broke up amid a babble
of voices and great confusion i
found miss devry practically on my
neck wringing my hand and for once
venting real congratulations

  i suppose you realize bodham she
barked that when you marry cathay i
shall be in a way your aunt

  i chuckled thats not so bad if you
had a mustache youd be my uncle
she cackled out a laugh well ill
need a new secretary i intend to ask
your sister if shell act as secretary and
companion to me wont be for long
god knows  i suppose theyll hang
peterson or electrocute him or gas him
or whatever it is they do to murderers
in this fool state

  no i said she jerked a look st me
no what the devil do you mean
he signed that confession

  he could sign a dozen confessions
and with a slick lawyer for a mouth-
piece hed be out of jail before youre
out of mourning

  i was nearly right at that in my
case-book the name of peterson still
heads an open page

ber wolf and man to man will be our book-length novel next month

 the first shell exploded close by while the graf spee was still
 out of sight below the horizon    this saga of the sea in
  has such special interest that we are giving over the en-
 tire real experience department to it

by thomas foley

on december  the doric star-
captain stubbs commander
was four hundred miles west of
port loango on her way from
capetown to freetown-where we were
supposed to join a convoy waiting for
us we were all counting the days and
wondering whether we would reach lon-
don for christmas i was london-born
but had not been home for sixteen years

  as lookout from twelve till two in the
afternoon i climbed up the ladder to the
watching-nest on the mainmast this
watching-nest on a ship is a tiny cabin
just big enough to hold one man

  it was a fine day with the sun shin-
ing and a blue though choppy sea at
one oclock i heard the time-signal-two
bells-to which i replied with the same

  all clear nothing in sight

  at exactly twenty minutes past one
there was a terrific explosion

  a u-boat naturally that was ev-
erybodys thought after the explosion
there was a huge splash about one hun-
dred yards from the ship

  there were sharp commands from the
bridge the gun was manned and slewed
round in the direction of the splash

  i noticed and could feel that the ship
had changed course the captain was
trying to evade the thing that menaced
us whatever it might be i phoned
down to the bridge to report that i had
seen flashes of light from a western di-
rection and told my suspicion that they
probably came from the german pocket
battleship admiral scheer

  about two minutes later the air was
shaken by another terrific explosion and
the second shell-we knew by now that
it was a shell-splashed into the water
some fifty yards from the ship

  of course we all knew we were in
mortal danger the first shell had fallen
into the sea one hundred yards on the
port side the second fifty yards astern
the germans aim seemed excellent and
it was almost certain that the third shot
would be a direct hit

  suddenly however the ship began to
slow down then it stopped the doric
star was a ten-thousand-ton cargo-boat
carrying meat butter tinned goods and
wool from australia to england our
only armament was a single -inch gun
which might have proved a dangerous
weapon against a u-boat but of course
it would have been madness to pit this
small gun against the pocket battleships
eleven-inch giants the captain did not
dream of risking the lives of his crew
without any hope of success so when
our sparks got the german message
stop or we fire the captain gave the
order to stop the maximum speed of
the doric star with the engines driven
to bursting-point was only twelve knots
the german raider with a speed of from
twenty-seven to thirty knots could have
caught us in no time and would surely
have sunk us

  the next few minutes were full of
tense excitement the noise of the en-
gines had died down we had stopped
and from the bridge came the sound of
the captains whistle abandon shipi

  there was no trace of fear among the
crew every man knew exactly what he
had to do and did it below me on
deck everyone was working calmly but
quickly and skillfully attending to the

real

ft-

for details of our real experience


boats lifting the receiver i asked the
captain whether i was to come down

  yes at once replied the captain
he spoke in a calm unexcited voice

  i slid down the mainmast and has-
tened to lifeboat no  which was my
allotted station

  a fine mess this is i said to the
next man who happened to be the don-
key greaser they dont care about
christmas nor about my homecoming
after sixteen years 

  i hurried below in order-according to
regulations-to get my necessary belong-
ings  jadket overcoat life-belt etc then
i hurried back to the lifeboat which was
being got ready and left my load next
i rushed back to the storeroom to get
some food bread tinned meat milk and
tobacco i took the things to the boat
dashed back again to get blankets cloth-
ing tools a chronometer and compass

  the doric star had four lifeboats
three of them had already been lowered
and the men sat with oars in their hands
waiting for the command to pull away

  lifeboat no  was to carry the cap-
tain but he was still on the bridge it
had also been lowered by now but all
the men who had been in it except one
had come back on board and there we
were waiting for the captain and also
for the third shot from the battleship
which might sink us any minute now
then came the captains voice

  i want a man on the bridge

  i bounded up at once the second
mate mr willis ordered me to help de-
stroy the ships papers so that they

periences

story contest see page 

should not fall into german hands i
was surprised to see what a great lot of
papers we had been carrying

  meanwhile of course we were expect-
ing that third shot any instant and i
for one was thinking that if it was fired
after all our work with the papers would
be of precious little importance i

  all four lifeboats were by now fully
equipped and ready to pull away and
the captain ordered us into our boat

  the doric star carried approximately
sixty-one men-ten able seamen two or-
dinary seamen two deck boys the chief
cook the cook the baker the galley-boy
the wireless operator the chief engi-
neer about ten engineers three gunners
a number of auxiliary men and of course
the captain and four officers inciden-
tally the two deck-boys and the galley-
boy were on their first voyage

  there was a sudden gust of laughter
in our boat a big wave had given it a
big buffet and many of us knocked our
heads together

  looking back i am rather surprised
that we were able to laugh so heartily
over such a trifling thing at that moment
when everyone knew death was only just
around the corner however our mer-
riment soon abated when we saw that
some of our things had fallen overboard

the appearance of the pocket battle-
ship was quite sudden-at least it
seemed so to me at that moment the
term pocket battleship sounded rather
funny to me and rather surprising
why she was a gigantic ship gigantic
and graceful as she rode the waves her
general color was gray but she was cam-
ouflaged in white yellow and green and
she would have been quite an attractive
real experiences

sight had not those eleven-inch guns
been turned in our direction

  the battleship sailed toward us in a
sweeping curve from the point on the
horizon where i had first seen the flashes
majestically she moved astern of us
but whatever her position in relation to
the doric star her guns always slewed
round to cover us and not for a moment
were we free from the direct menace of
these monsters the ship approached
with terrific speed and we were already
able to see the german sailors on deck

  the guns were manned while the rest
of the crew occupied the same positions
as would the crew of a british battleship
in similar circumstances when the bat-
tleship was within a few hundred yards
of us there appeared between her fun-
nel and eontrol-tower a large white board
bearing the warning in large red letters
stop wireless ar we fire i

  we knew that our sos had already
been picked up by two ships and also
knew that one of them was a greek ves-
sel we were hoping that they might in-
form the british navy where to look
for the german raider

  the battleship stopped and rapidly
they lowered a huge motorboat which
was manned by some seventy german
sailors they were still far away when
they began to shout in broken english
get back get back

 all the men from the boats climbed
back on board the doric star we lined
up on deck and waited it was a rather
uncomfortable sensation to stand facing
the black mouths of those huge guns

 the germans came on board about
fifty of them placed detonators in vari-
ous parts of the ship the situation was
getting painful what with guns staring
at us from the outside and explosives
being planted under our feet

  twenty of the germans came on deck
with revolvers at the ready and bayonets
buckled to their middles they were
led by a lean officer who hastened onto
the bridge and in fairly good english de-
manded to see the wireless operator

  a few minutes passed we the crew
looked at the german officer curiously
while he conscious of the seriousness of
the situation and of his own role in it
gazed in front of him with a stern air

   the situation was tense at least as far
as we were concerned we had all seen
the german warning-stop wireless or
we fire -but we had no means of know-
ing whether the wireless operator had
in fact ceased to send sos messages
and we were convinced that as spon as
he appeared on deck the german offi-
cer would shoot him dead

   at last the wireless operator appeared
are you the wireless operator
snapped the german

   yes

  the german took him aside on the
bridge and for a few minutes the two
conversed together

   next the first mate mr ransome on
the germans orders called the roll
the german sailors lined us up then
marched us to the other side of our ship

  there we again stood and waited
then the german officer came round to
us and in a queer croaking teutonic
voice began to speak

   i will give you ten minutes within
ten minutes you must get together your
blankets some food and eating-utensils
meanwhile the german sailors will
place explosives and after ten minutes
it will be blown up

  a brief pause then he added
youre all coming with me on board
the graf spee

we went to collect the things we re-
garded as necessary or desirable
it did not occur to any of us to give even
a single thought to the information that
the raider was not the admiral scheer
but the graf spee

  what did surprise us was the sudden
turn of events also we were rather
curious to know what the germans really
wanted to do with us we had been
quite prepared to see our ship blown up
and to die with her ourselves alternate-
ly we had regarded it as a possibility
that they might leave us to our fate in
the lifeboats so that we might either die
of starvation and exposure or be picked
up by some other vessel but what on
earth could they want with us aboard
their battleship 

   having collected our belongings the
majority of us at the command of the
german officer got into the german mo-
torboat the chief engineer a seaman
named macmanus and i got into our
lifeboat no  and rowed toward the
graf spec-also on the germans com-
mand i do not understand to this day
why the three of us had to row across

i was an altmark prisoner

to the german battleship in our own
boat when all the rest of the crew made
the journey on the german motor-boat
-which if i remember aright did the
job in three trips i certainly had a
bad time for although i was the small-
est and physically the least strong of the
three it was i who had to row my gum-
boots kept slipping on the wet bottom
and my hands were injured-though i
was not conscious of it at the time

   the distance was considerably greater
than it appeared from our ship-so much
so that the chief engineer also had to
 take a turn at the oars as we ap-
proached the battleship its terrifying di-
mensions struck me all the more

aboard the graf spee

suddenly there was a mighty ex-
plosion we looked around no it
was not the doric star we later learned
that there had been an explosion of unde-
termined cause in no  hold

   another surprise the gray hull of the
 german battleship bore the inscription
 deutschland although we had other
 things to worry about just then we
 found the time to be puzzled over this
 which one of the three german pocket
 battleships was this  the deutsch-
 land the admiral scheer or the graf
 spee our puzzlement was heightened
 by the fact that the tabs on the caps of
 the sailors who had boarded us clearly
 said graf spee it was only later that
 we learned how the germans had inter-
 changed the names of the german ships
 or even sailed under the names of neu-
 tral ships and under the flags of neutral
 countries

   at all events we three climbed aboard
 the ship where we were received by a
 tall angry-looking officer with a black
 beard who in fairly fluent english or-
 dered us to the other side of the ship so
 that we should not be able to see the
 doric star which was here screened
 from our view bj the guns

  when we were all on board the graf
spee the roll was called again this
time the list was read by an extraordi-
narily tall clean-shaven officer of about
thirty who pronounced our names so
badly that we had the greatest difficulty
in recognizing them at all events we
were all there none missing

  below decks came the order

  we all went below one of the
guards asked which of us had any soap

and of course the majority of us raised
our hands

  then have a bath said the guard
we thought that we were really being
given an opportunity to take a bath i
do not know whether the germans bathe
differently from us certain it is that the
bath we got on board the german battle-
ship was very different from what we
had been used to down there in the bot-
tom of the ship there were no bathtubs
only a lot of hip baths we were all
herded into the room together officers
and crew alike and had to do the best
we could our clothes were taken away
immediately we had undressed and we
suspected some german devilry how-
ever they were brought back after a time
and we gathered that they had only been
disinfected

  while we were dressing we heard a
deafening explosion which shook the
whole of the mighty warship there
were six more similar explosions and we
knew that the big guns of the graf spee
were at work   

  later the germans also fired two tor-
pedoes and we heard further explosions
as the detonators placed in the doric
star went off the bathroom at the
bottom of the graf spee had a small
porthole we all crowded to it for a final
glimpse of our beautiful ship we saw
how she received her mortal wounds how
she slowly heeled over and sank it took
a long long time and i for one felt that
the doric star strong and sturdy as she
had always been was making a fight for
it actually the germans took four
hours to sink her from first to last

  after our strange bath the germans
informed us that we would have to un-
dergo a medical examination they
marched us through a series of long cor-
ridors to the ships hospital i was in
the first group of fifteen men

  the hospital was a fine large room
spotlessly clean like everything else on
the graf spee the beds were occupied
by fifteen or twenty german sailors

  the doctor was a tall man with red
hair thinning at the top the exami-
nation was brief the doctor asked
each man his name and age that was
all he did not touch anyone or even
take a good look at anyone nor was a
medical examination necessary for at
that time having up till then lived on a
british diet we were almost bursting
with health we had color in our cheeks
and did not need a doctor to tell that
there was nothing wrong with us


real experiences

  everything on board was of gigantic
dimensions and everything was scrupu-
lously clean but it was clear that the
germans had been very careful to use
the lightest of materials for everything
so that this comparatively small ship
should have a speed comparable with
that of our hms hood

  on board the graf spee the germans
treated us rather coldly yet on the whole
not badly we never talked to anyone
besides our guards later we learned that
the other sailors were strictly forbidden
to communicate with us in any way

  naturally our greatest preoccupation
on board the german battleship was
what fate the germans had decreed for
us i put this question to several of the
guards but they could not or would not
say anything

  at last however one of the guards
deigned to reply to my question

  youll only be staying on board for
another few days

  and then

  youll be transferred to a tanker

naturally we discussed this news
among ourselves with much inter-
est and excitement finally we came
to the conclusion that the germans were
going to transfer us to a neutral ship
so that eventually we would get back to
england this made us very optimistic
and cheerful we had not the faintest
idea what was really in store for us the
sailors on the graf spee treated us cold-
ly but were comparatively friendly and
not unkind and we could not guess how
brutal the germans could be when they
showed their real faces particularly if
they were enthusiastic nazis  

  there were four decks and we were
kept on the third that is the second
from the bottom the part where we
lived was close to the forepeak or near
bow the room was about sixty feet
by twenty-five and shaped like the hull

  there were about sixty of us in that
room and despite the apparently large
size of our prison we were rather crowd-
ed there were only a few mattresses
available so that the majority had to
sleep on the floor i was one of the for-
tunate ones who were spared this discom-
fort the heat was sometimes intolerr
able and our situation was aggravated
further by the fact that we were not
allowed to open the portholes without
special permission on one occasion
when we opened them without permis-
sion we got a bad dousing as the sea

shot into the room this was no joke
-most of us had but one suit of clothes
and a wetting did not improve it how-
ever despite all that we received the in-
rush of water with cheers-it was some-
thing to break the monotony

  the graf spee was traveling at full
speed toward her-to us-unknown des-
tination obviously after sinking a ship
she had to vanish from the scene as
quickly as possible otherwise the brit-
ish navy would learn her whereabouts
and of course she could only be heroic
with defenceless merchant ships

  we were guarded by a single sailor
who stood outside the door with his re-
volver at the ready and a bayonet at his
side every now and then an officer
would come down to have a look at us

  we were given our first meal on board
the graf spee at six oclock on the after-
noon of december nd it consisted of
a large cup of black coffee without sugar
some black bread which tasted sour and
was really uneatable despite the addi-
tion of some stuff the germans said was
butter and some sausage the germans
said the sausage was sehr gut-but not
one of us could finish his portion

  this was a very poor tea after what 
we had been used to on board the doric
star and it seemed all the poorer when
we discovered that it was not tea at alj
but tea and supper rolled together we
discovered this when we were not given
any more food that evening

  at about eight oclock we all turned in
and gradually the room became quiet

at five next morning we were awakened
by the sound of a harsh german com-
mand which came blaring forth from
the megaphones fitted in every part of
the ship action stations  action sta-
tions  a ction stations 

  within a few seconds we heard the fir-
ing of one of the eleven-inch guns of
course we all jumped up in great excite-
ment we had no idea what was hap- 
pening but we were hoping that the
graf spee had been caught by our navy

  there were three or four more shots
one after the other the ship shivered
as if she was going to fall to pieces
there followed a tense silence the
tenseness was in the very air so you
could almost touch it the graf spee
stopped an hour passed like this we
knew that this was no naval battle and
our hearts sank another hour passed
then another before the graf spee shiv-
ered into movement again full speed
ahead it was we could only guess
i was an altmark prisoner

what had happened we only learned
for certain at six oclock in the after-
noon when we went on deck to wash
we went to the taps in groups of twenty
i was in the first group the german
guard smiling from ear to ear received
us and being unable to speak a word
of english he twisted himself into knots
in an effort to make us understand that
another british ship had been sent to
the bottom

  what ship  i asked

  the german shrugged he either did
not know the name or would not tell

  later i discovered what had hap-
pened on the way back to our prison
i met a tall lanky lad in civilian clothes
i knew at once that he was british and
spoke to him his name he told me
was joe webb he looked terribly green
about the gills and at first i thought
he was seasick he was shaking like a
leaf too however he was not seasick
but wounded

  what ship i asked you had to be
brief because you never knew whether
the germans would let you talk

  the tairoa replied the lad the
germans fired at us because we didnt
stop the wireless im not sure but i
think there were two or three dead on
board and i was wounded

  as there was no guard in sight i asked
him to tell me everything they had
had a very similar experience to ours

  we suddenly heard an explosion he
said we didnt know what it was as
we couldnt see anything of course we
soon discovered that we were up against
a german raider  we received a wireless
message to stop our wireless but didnt
of course i didnt know about this till
later i was coming up on deck from
down below suddenly i felt a blow in
the arm i didnt know what had hit
me and it didnt hurt either i just
went on but then everything went dark
before my eyes and i felt i was falling
thats all i remember i only came to
on board this ship and it was here they
told me id been hit by a splinter and
also that the germans had sunk our ship
and we were prisoners on the graf spee
weve got another man wounded hes
in the hospital below

at eight oclock wed been given our
 breakfast i was terribly hungry
but the german coffee and bread were so
nauseating that i could not eat anything
then at midda we received our first
dinner the guard told us to send two

v

 men to the galley to get the food for all
 of us the two men brought back a
 huge copper containing our rations of
 course many of us had neither plates nor
 eating utensils as these things somehow
 got lost mislaid or forgotten during our
 transfer to the german ship so some of
 us had to wait until the others had fin-
 ished to use their things

   the dinner consisted of a sort of irish
 stew but there was plenty of it that
 was no advantage however because it
 was bad everything was bad  through-
 out my imprisonment by the germans i
 never got anything but sour bread rice
 potatoes cooked in some strange way
 irish stew tinned milk and black coffee

   our daily work consisted in opening
 up the folding tables for our meals and
 folding them up again after meals

   on the direct orders of the captain-
 as we learned later-we were given plen-
 ty of opportunities on board the graf
 spee for exercise in the open air this
 was a relief and a blessing as our quar-
 ters were very hot and stuffy at the
 time however we did not know what a
 tremendous concession it was on the part
 of the captain to let us come on deck for
 exercise three times a day

   i only saw captain langsdorff com-
 mander of the graf spee once that
 was one morning when we were out near
 the bow of the ship and the germans
 were holding some sort of inspection
 close by nearly the entire crew of the
 ship were lined up and captain langs-
 dorff accompanied by three of his offi-
 cers passed slowly in front of them

   captain langsdorff was a man of me-
 dium height clean-shaven smart-look-
 ing with a sort of sad look in his eyes
 you could see at a glance that he was
 an officer and a gentleman and we all
 agreed that he could not possibly be a
 prussian as our former chief cook mr
 underwood remarked the fellow looks
 so decent he might almost be british

   on one occasion i discovered a queer
 rite practiced by the germans on the
 graf spee in memory of each british
 ship they sank they placed a wreath of
 green leaves with a long bow some-
 where near the mess-deck the bow
 bore the name of the ship concerned
real experiences

i saw the tairoa wreath i think the
placing of the wreath was always ac-
companied by an elaborate ceremonial
apparently the germans were proud of
their exploits in sinking defenceless mer-
chant ships   

  all the time i was on board the graf
spee i watched the germans and i must
say i did not dislike them their way
of being polite was different from ours
somehow it was cold and artificial or
rather mechanfcal but they were polite
just the same it seemed to me that they
were always wearing a mask and even
when they smiled i felt that it was not
because they were feeling pleased about
anything but because they had decided
to smile or perhaps because it was in
their regulations to smile at certain times

  another thing that struck me was that
the german sailors did not-at least in
our presence-talk to each other simply
and naturally as we were accustomed to
talk among ourselves and even with our
officers there was a certain cold for-
mality between them whenever they
passed each other on deck they raised
their right arms and said heil hitler
they did this a hundred times a day

  the wireless seemed to be going con-
tinuously all day we listened to the
german broadcasts-we could not help
it-but few understood any part of them
sometimes however it was music-in-
cluding english gramophone records

  there was only one case of near-
friendship between one of us and one of
the german sailors bill wheeler one
of the gunners of the doric star seemed
to take a liking to a sailor named
kroner who spoke good english de-
spite the strict ban on conversation be-
tween the british prisoners and crew of
the graf spee they talked and argued a
lot with each other of course there was
a certain reserve on both sides and there
were things they never mentioned they
kept on neutral ground so to speak

  when the war is over said kroner
one day well have a drink together

  wheeler agreed and the two of them
exchanged addresses i wonder whether
kroner was among the casualties on the
graf spee or whether he and wheeler
will have that drink together some day

  on one occasion i wats able to visit the
galley of the graf spee everything was
clean and bright i was rather sur-
prised to find that there was apparently
a qualified cook there for as far as my
experience of the food went his only
task was to open tins and boil potatoes

i spoke to the cook observing that he
must be very clever indeed to be able
to open as many tins as were required
here and to carry out his task with so
much good taste of course i did not
think he understood what i as saying
to my astonishment however he burst
into laughter and said in perfect english
that he had only been appointed cook of
the graf spee half an hour before

  why youre british i said

  of course i am replied the cook

  whats your name

  roy baker

  how did you get here then

  i was on the travanian said roy
they sank her and put us on a tank-
er-

  what tanker i interrupted eagerly

  the altmark said roy shes dis-
guised as a norwegian i was on board
her for two months the crew of the
ashley huntsman and newton beach 
are still there its awful

  altmark    that was the first time
i heard the name of the hell-ship

  a man from the ashley told me-
began roy but he could not finish the
sentence for a german sailor who un-
observed by us had been listening to
our conversation now interrupted and
politely but firmly requested me to leave
the galley as i was holding up the cook
and might be delaying the supper

  i reported to my mates the conversa-
tion i had had with roy baker for
some reason we did not connect the alt-
mark with the tanker to which we had
been told we were going to be trans-
ferred for we were still sure we would
be transferred to a neutral ship and
would somehow get back to england

  we were all impatiently waiting to
get on board the tanker blissfully igno-
rant of what we were really longing for

on thursday december th the mas-
ter-at-arms came down to our prison

  get ready he said in his snappy
teutonic style were meeting a tank-
er today to which youll be transferred
you may have to leave this ship any
minute

  we knew that we were now somewhere
in the southern atlantic
i was an altmark prisoner

  we packed our few belongings and
were all marched to the stern of the
ship here after four days separation
we met our officers again together with
the captains and officers of several other
ships that was the last we saw of our
captains and officers it was only very
much later that i heard that they had
been landed and released in montevideo
after the graf spee battle

while waiting on deck i got into con-
versation with the second mate of the
travanian i asked whether he knew
what ship we were being transferred to
yes he said the altmark

  any good 

  horrible  he said i was there
for a month and i was glad to get away
the foods uneatable the treatment bru-
tal they rob you and humiliate you
when youre on the altmark youll learn
what the germans are really like
whats going to happen to us after
the altmark  i asked my newfound
friend

  captain langsdorff said well be tak-
en to germany the graf spee will
soon be making for a german port-
hamburg i think theres only one
chance for you people-that the graf
spee is caught or- sunk by our navy in
that case the altmark will undoubtedly
seek refuge in a neutral port and then
youll all be released in accordance with
international law

  i asked the young fellow to tell me
some more about the altmark

  wll he said theres the white
bread they give you for breakfast
theres only one thing thats worse than
that-the black bread they give you for
dinner he waved his hand adding
whats the use of telling you youll
know everything soon enough

  we stood on deck for hours the
weather was fine and warm for we were
near the tropics there was a fine rip-
ple on the sea

  suddenly we saw a puff of smoke ap-
proaching from the west evidently it
was the tanker the graf spee made for
it in a wide sweeping curve then the
two ships hove to just then i had a
chance to exchange a few words with
captain stubbs of the doric star

  whats going to happen to you cap-
tain  i asked

  theyre taking us to germany he-
replied at least they want to take
us there and maybe the graf spee will
get there unless we meet the navy
somewhere

  we were now able to see the prison-
ship clearly she was a fine big ship
painted all white she flew the norwe-
gian flag and had the word norge painted
in huge letters amidships the name of
the ship on the bow was songne since
then the altmark has had two or three
new names and been painted over in four
or five different colors

  the graf spee lowered her motorboat
and one of the german officers told us
say good-by to your officers
good-by and good luck  we all said
to each other

  the roll was now called then pho-
tographers from the other ship took pho-
tographs of us then we the crews got
into the motorboat our belongings were
thrown into a huge net and lowered in-
to the motorboat and so we pulled away

  as we were approaching the white
ship i liked her shape more and more
she had many decks and her bridges
were placed in a rather interesting way
the thing that struck me particularly
were the two pom-pom guns on board
they were half covered with canvas that
was the first and last time i saw the
guns they were hidden more carefully
later the motorboat hove to and we
climbed up the jacobs ladder i did
not know then that i was climbing
straight into hell

aboard the altmark

the first person i saw aboard the
altmark was a young slim baby-
faced german officer in white uniform
there were two guards behind him he
was in charge of us prisoners we never
learned his name and we referred to him
as babyface he was the man we
communicated with most while we were
on the ship it was he who conveyed to
us the captains orders he who listened
to our complaints he who-very very
frequently-saw to it that the punish-
ments imposed upon us by the captain
were duly carried out

  babyface had been to an american
college for several years and he spoke
english fluently his first order to us
was to line up on the starboard deck-
the germans apparently had a mania
for lining us up there we stood for
about three hours we were not even
allowed to talk to each other it took
all that time for the motorboat to make
three trips to get the rest of the prison-
ers across
real experiences

  at last after three hours of waiting
babyface in his white uniform stepped
out and addressed us with that sharpness
and aggressiveness in his voice of which
only the germans are capable	

  you are on a german prison-ship
said babyface we are the supply ship
of the graf spee you will be treated
as prisoners of war and i must warn
you not to expect a life of luxury i
want you all to surrender your matches
revolvers knives and any other weap-
ons or tools which can be used to do
damage i warn you that if any of you
retain anything youve been ordered to
surrender you will be punished

  the guards went round and the men
hesitantly and with wry faces began to
give up what was required though of
course none of us had revolvers the
only really valuable thing given up be-
longed to my friend jack turnbull it
was a pocket-knife with a wonderfully
carved ivory handle a veritable master-
piece babyface admired it greatly and
after making a few complimentary re-
marks about it he pocketed it then
the officer discovered that turnbull also
possessed a pipe-cleaner of similar work-
manship and confiscated that as well
tacitly raising it to the dignity of a
weapon with the aid of which damage
might be done it was touching to see
the lingering look turnbull gave it as
he handed it over to babyface and the
way he watched it on its brief journey
to the germans pocket

  roll-call again then babyface led
us below into our apartments down
down we climbed until we reached the
third deck-the second from the bottom
this was e deck as we entered our
prison we had now the time for a full
realization of what a terrible place this
was and this deck was already occupied
by the crew of the travanian

it was here i first met jack flanagan
with whom i later shared so many
jolly hours sufferings and adventures
and who indeed became my cobach
australian slang for pal flanagan
is an irishman from liverpool

  naturally as soon as babyface had
left us there began a lively general con-
versation between the two sets of cap-
tives we told each other about our ad-
ventures in the middle of the conver-
sation i said to flanagan

  got a fag mate

  whereupon all the other fellows burst
into uproaribus laughter

  he wants a fag they guffawed
smacking their legs he wants a fag
it turned out that what cigarettes
they had were long gone and it tickled
them to hear me talk so casually about
such a rare and precious thing it ap-
peared that the boys had been smoking
tea-leaves for weeks-drying the tea
leaves and rolling them into thin paper
later i did the same

  about an hour after we came aboard
one of the guards came into the room
that was the only time i saw this par-
ticular man so i never learned his name
there were forty guards watching us
prisoners and we only knew the names
of the permanent ones

  well this man came into the room
looked round cautiously then motioned
to one of the travanian men they be-
gan to talk in whispers but i was quite
close to them so i could hear the guard
was asking the other fellow in english
whether he wanted any cigarettes

  of course i do was the reply
  what will you give 

  the englishman thought for a mo-
ment  then he said

  ive got a good shirt you can have
that how many cigarettes will you
give me for it 

  two said the german

  two   cried the englishman two
fags for a shirt there was genuine
indignation in his voice yet there was
something in his tone which would have
betrayed even to a child that he was
ready to give in he would have parted
with his shirt for even one cigarette

  all right sighed the englishman
and the bargain was made

  barter transactions of this kind were
made every day the guards were con-
tinually haggling with us and robbing
us right and left

  there were forty-five men in all on e
deck nineteen from the travanian and
twenty-six from the doric star as far
as we knew there was a total of 
prisoners on board and later after our
release i was surprised to read in the
papers that they had only found 
perhaps four of the prisoners had dis-
appeared in some way

  the e deck was according to the
standards of the altmark comparatively
comfortable the rest of the doric star
crew were worse off than we for they
were on the bottom deck which was
even mustier than our quarters

  we were so cramped that there was no
room to move there was nowhere to


i was an altmark prisoner

put our clothes when we lay down and
most of us slept-or tried to sleep-in
our clothes of course there were no
beds or bunks or any proper sleeping ac-
commodation just a single blanket ev-
ery morning we woke with aching limbs
and it took some hours before the ache
went out of them our misery was ag-
gravated by the fact that our prison was
cold at night and we were all shivering

soon after our arrival aboard the alt-
mark we were given our first meal
which was tea the guard ordered two
men each from among the travanian and
doric star crews to go to the galley
they brought back a copperful of tea
and some bread each man received
three slices of bread two black and one
white the bread was so inconceivably
bad that even the worst i had heard
about it now sounded like praise it was
sheer poison sailors dont usually suf-
fer with their digestions and i am as
tough in that respect as most yet when
i swallowed the first bite of that bread
it made my stomach turn that was the
white bread i could not imagine any-
thing worse than that so i took a bite
of the black bread   gosh

  the old-timers-the boys of the tra-
vanian-immediately began to swap
selling one slice of white bread for two
of black during the first few days we
newcomers were only too pleased to
make the exchange for the white bread
was the lesser of two evils later how-
ever i found that the black bread sour
and sticky as it was was more filling than
the white bread and made the voidin my
stomach less painful in any case the
barter business with the bread was soon
to stop as after a time the germans gave
us only black bread

  the tea itself was a very pleasant sur-
prise-the finest tea i had ever drunk
but the secret of this luxurious beverage
was no secret to us the germans had
pinched the tea off the huntsman i was
told that the price of this tea in london
was sixteen shillings a pound and that
it required only a few spoonfuls of leaves
to make tea for the forty-five of us

  unfortunately even this luxury did
not last long for the fine tea either gave
out or was stopped for the prisoners

  in the evening we witnessed an inter-
esting and exciting scene one of the
german crew slipped into our prison
from the way he was welcomed by the
travanian boys i knew he was a friend
later they told me that he had been

coming down frequently helping them
when he could and bringing them bits
of good food and a few cigarettes in a
word he was a thoroughly human fel-
low this time he came with four or
five cigarettes which he distributed
among his friends just then one of our
guards whom we knew as fritz hap-
pened to enter the room

  whats going on here he snapped
no reply fritz turned on the other
german

  what are you doing here he said
in bullying tone all this was in ger-
man and interpreted to me later by some
of the boys who knew the language

  nothing replied our friend i
came down to have a talk

  dont you know that it is strictly
forbidden to talk with the prisoners
i do but i havent actually talked
with them yet i havent had the time
really said the guard it was
clear from his expression that he was
happy to be able to get his comrade in-
to trouble i suppose you think i didnt
see you give them cigarettes that is a
very serious offence the captain has
strictly forbidden us to give cigarettes
to the englishmen they will teach you
to respect the discipline of the ship
you are charging me with something

i	havent done protested our friend

  it was all in vain fritz did not be-
lieve him for he had actually seen the
lad distributing the cigarettes he said
something and a sharp altercation de-
veloped they shouted louder and loud-
er then fritz said something that must
have been highly insulting anyhow
the prisoners poor young friend went
very red in the face and although the
other german was nearly twice his size
he flew at him and gave him a terrific
punch on the jaw fritz jumped t him
and after a short struggle twisted his
arms behind him and marched him up
the ladder like that next morning we
heard that the lad had been thrown in-
to clink there was a court-martial at
noon we never heard anything for cer-
tain about the sentence of the court
some said he was to be executed for
striking a soldier while according to
others he was only given fifteen days
solitary on bread and water i cannot
say which version is right if either at
all events we did not see the lad again

  the first evening we talked for about
an hour mainly about the above-men-
tioned incident then we tried to go to
sleep it took a long long time we


real experiences

lay on the hard dusty floor packed close
together tossing and groaning for hours
when at last we slept it was from sheer
exhaustion of both body and mind

  at six oclock the following morning
one of the german guards came in and
began to shout

  come up wash wash it sound-
ed more like gom oop vash vash

  i	then discovered in retrospect that
the hip baths on board the graf spee
were a luxury here on the altmark
washing was a painful business they
allowed us only one quart per man for
washing of course that would not
have been enough even with proper
soap but what the germans gave us was
a lump of hard gray substance which
only dirtied our skin

  we also had a bath now and then
the bath was of the same standard as
the wash we were herded into a large
cabin and there packed so close we
could hardly move we took our bath
in a few bucketfuls of water between us
the water was hot heated by the steam
from the boilers but it was so little that
those of us who used the so-called soap
had not enough water to clean it off at
the same time we had to use the same
water to wash our underwear and of
course it was dirty from the soap
drinking water was scarcer still we
were tormented by constant thirst

we met the altmarks notorious cap-
tain the day after our arrival baby-
face came down to tell us to go on deck as
the captain wanted to speak to us

  the captain was a small thin fellow
with an angry face decorated with a
goatee beard he was standing in the
bow of the ship and we all crowded
round him remarkably enough we
were not lined up the captain had an
ugly scowl on his face as he looked us
over i was a bit slow perhaps because
my legs felt heavy the captain saw me
and turned on me at once

  come along come along he snapped
hurry up    if you dont ill teach
you-ill teach you  

  when we were all assembled the ven-
omous little german looked round with
eyes full of hatred

  as you know he began you are
on board a german prison-ship you
are prisoners prisoners of war maybe
that is not your fault as many of you
sailed before the outbreak of war and

were already at sea when it started you
must keep the rules and regulations of
this ship with absolute precision and
you must carry out my orders quickly
and efficiently otherwise youll soon get
acquainted with the ships prison and i
can tell you its not a pleasant place

  i hate the british i hate them with
all my heart and let me tell you that
every german hates you just as much
after the last war your government de-
prived us of our colonies that is why

i	cant land you in any of them but must
take you to germany but i assure you
that after this war well get back every-
thing youve stolen from us

  perhaps murmured my friend sam
flowers from behind me

  germany is going to win this war 
he went on the germany of today is
not like the germany of the past it is
the germany of the fuehrer-strong and
invincible germany is going to win 

there was a sudden burst of laughter
and booing from us some of the
chaps held their sides with merriment
the little german turned pale as death
and was quivering with rage in every
limb

  your demonstration leaves me cold
he said his lips were twitching his eyes
glittering and it was obvious that he was
anything but cold yes he went on
i assure you were going to win this
war and it wont take long before we
get our colonies back his voice rose
higher and higher until he was scream-
ing he was now jabbering away in
german so the majority of us did not
know what he was saying he grew red
in the face and as he stood shouting at
the top of his voice with his goatee
trembling he looked ridiculous it was
easy to see he was filled with an insane
hatred of the british later we learned
that he had kept it up since the last war
and we ourselves were made to feel it
during the next two months captain
dau had been in the last war and had
been a prisoner of war in the hands of
the british and he vented all the rage
of his captivity and also his personal
sense of humiliation when germany lost
the war on us now at his mercy

  after the captains vitriolic address
we were marched back to our prison he
never spoke to us directly after that
though he frequently made us feel his
cruel power

sue with the dramatic rescue in norwegian waters

have you tried a lucky lately 

 actual color photograph - how toastingadds extra mellowness to the golden leaf

and thats how toasting works

  you may be as familiar with the phrase itstoasted as you
     are with your own name

  but do you know how toasting gives you a better cigarette

     first it uses higher heat treatments to take out certain harsh
  throat irritants found in all tobacco  making luckies easy on
  your throat

     second it uses the concentrated sunshine of ultra-violet rays
  to add extra mellowness to the fine tobaccos in luckies

  no other cigarette gives you the cream of the finest crops
  on record-plus the throat protection of its toasted

  try luckies for a week youll see why with independent tobac-
  co experts-buyers warehousemen auctioneers-with men
  who know tobacco best-it s luckies  to
