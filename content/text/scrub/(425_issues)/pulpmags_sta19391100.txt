a money-making opportunity

   for men of character

              exclusive franchise for

   an invention expected to replace
   a multi-miluon-dollar industry

costly work formerly
sent out by business men
now done by themselves
at a fraction of the expense

         this is a call for met everywhere to handle
         exclusive agency for one of the most
         unique business inventions of the day

forty years ago the horse and buggy business was supreme-today
almost extinct twenty years ago the phonograph industry ran into
many millions-today practically a relic only a comparatively few
foresighted men saw the fortunes ahead in the automobile and the
radio yet irresistible waves of public buying swept these men to
fortune and sent the buggy and the phonograph into the discard so
are great successes made by men able to detect the shift in public faror
from one industry to nother

ntte mother changt h taking place an old established industry-u integral

and taproot part o the nations structure-in which millioos of dollara chance hinds
every year-is in thousands of cues being replaced by a truly astonishing simple inven-
tion which does the work better-more reliably-and at a cost often as low
as  of what u ordinarily paidi it has not requited vet- long for men
who have taken over the rijhta to this valuable invention to do a remarkable business
and show earnings which in these times are almost unheard of for the average man

earnings

one man in california earned over  	---tt

less than a month of actual selling
that because i have heen getting or--- -   r 
at least half the day in the olfice c -z-    -vii

right kind of nua one mas wick n la lirrff wmk m
a thousand sales on which his  - -ir - s   w
per sale and more a great deal oi - - y w  tkh
business yet he had never dcr	ce

coming wirh us that is the load u -tuaea
offers the fact that this bonne si- t-tcrrl s toa
business men as former bankers ci- -- a
men who demand only the bigiiest af mmamdbf
income-gives a fairly good picas of ec hat a kanca
is our door is open however to ue -m bcijej for
the right field ia which to make his srarr

       not a-godtet
     not a knick-knack-

     but a valuable proved device which
     has been sold successfully by busi-
     ness novices as well as seasoned
     veterans

make no mistake-this is  novelty-tso flimsy era two
which the inventor hopes to pul  the market you
probably have seen nothing like it yet-ptrhapj never
dreamed of the existence of soch a device-yet it has already
been used by corporations of outstanding prominence-by
dealers of great corporations-by their stanchet-by doc-
tors newspapers publishers-schools-hospitals etc etc
and by thousands of small business men you dont have to
convince a man that he should use an electric bulb to light
his office instead of a gas lamp not do you have to sell
the same business mao the idea that some day he may need
something like this invention the need is already there-
the money is usually being spent right at that vety
moment-and the desirability of saving the greatest
part of chia eapeose is obvious immcdiioely

         some  the savings
           you can show

roti walk into an office and put down before your prospect
 letter from a sales organiiatson showing that they did
work in their own occ lor  which formerly coaid have
con them over sc a building supply corporation pays
our mao  wtmtu ih bill could have been for si 
an automobile dealer pays oar representative si whereas
the expense coum have been over si ccd a department
itore has cxreme of  possible cost if done outiide
the business being well over  and woo we could
not possibly list afl casc here thcts are just a few of
the many ktoal cases which we pucc in your hands to
work with- practically every line of busioevs and every
section of the country is rcrwesented by these held reports
rhifh hammrr irnw dirarng convincing monry-taving
ggortunuies which hardly any business man can fail to

          profits typical of
      the young growing industry

going inro thb business it not like celling something
offered in every grocery drug or department store for
instance when you take a  order  can be yonr
share- on  worth of business jour share can be
 the vcrv least you get as your pan of every
dollars worth of business you do i  ceocs-on ten
dollars worth  on a hundred dollars worth 
-in other words two thirds of every order yoo get is
yours not ooly on the first order-but oo repeat orders
-and you have the opportunity of earning an even larger
percentage

this business has
nothing to do with
bouse to house canvassing

nor do you have to know anything about higb-prtssore
selling selling is unnecessary in the ordinary sense of
the word instead of hammering away at the customer
and trying to force a sale you make a dignified
business-like call leave the installation-whatever uic
the customer says he wjj accept-at our risk let the
c us toner sell hira-clf after the device is in and working
this does away with the need for pressure oo the cus-
tomer-it eliminates the handicap of trying to get the
money before the customer has really convinced kmvvlf
co you simply tell what you offer showing proof of
success in that customers particular line of business
then leave the invention without a dollar down it
karts working at once in a few short days the installa-
tion should actually produce enough cash money to pay
foe the deal jvlth profits above the investment coming la
at the same time- you then call back collect your cqoney
nothing is so convincing as our offer to la results speak
for themselves without risk to the customer i while others
fail co get even a hearing our men are making tales
running into the hundreds they ha we received the areco
tion of the largest finai in the country and sold to the
smallest businesses by the thousands

is the time

business is searching

for you if  

right now in many lines there is a search
 for really good men-managers leaders-
men who can take charge of departments busi-
nesses branch offices and get things humming

  as always there are not enough ordinary
jobs to go round-but rarely before in the
history of american business has there been

so much room at the top and new jobs are
being created by the business pick-up in many
lines-jobs that pay splendidly and that open
the way to lifetime success

  ordinarily there would be plenty of men to
fill these jobs-men in junior positions who
had been studying in spare time but most men
have been letting their training slide during
these dark years of depression  whats the
use-you have heard them say perhaps
there has been some excuse for sticking to any
old kind of a job one could get the past few
years-but the door is wide open for the man
with ambition and ability now

  and dont let anyone tell you that oppor-
tunity only knocks once-thats one of the
most untruthful sayings ever circulated op-

portunities flourish for every american every
day of his life

  far more to the point is to be ready-to be
prepared- to make yourself interesting to the
hig-time employer-and lasalle offers you a
short-cut method of qualifying for opportunity
jobs in accounting law traffic executive man-
agement and kindred occupations

  lasalle extension is  years old-averages
over  enrollments a year- american
firms each employ  or more lasalle-trained
men-surveys show that many lasalle stu-
dents attain  salary increase after gradu-
ation- of all cpas in the u s a are
lasalle-alumni

  why not find out what lasalle has done and
is doing for men in your position send and get
the facts see what lasalle can do for you
personally

  theres no question about it-business is
picking up-jobs are looking for men-the time
has come for you to qualify for prosperity

by jack williamson

author of the fortress of utopia this

months book-ienglh novel

it is thirteen years since a rather lonely
dreamy farm boy stumbled across his
first stray copy of a sciencc fiction maga-
zine-which had a glorious cover by paul-
and was instantly gripped by the breath-tak-
ing wonder of this new world of science and
imagination

  at once i knew that i wanted to write
science fiction and soon forgot a planned
career in chemistry to do it the first story
appeared within two years and more than a
million words have been printed since but
still i find that every
 science fiction story
is a new and thrill-
ing adventure

hmflp fefei three-month stay
hppx flkjjjg this spring in new

  the novel-if the
editors will allow a
behind - the - scenes
glimpse-was evolved in a series of con-
ferences with the staff of startling
stories

  a good deal is said these days about
utopias nearly every orator in fact on
every soap-box has his own utopian scheme
to cure the ills of the world and your alert
editors propounded this question

  what would happen if a band of earnest
scientists equipped with a certain instru-
mentality set out to transform our muddling
modern world into a planned utopia

  fortress of utopia is a science-
fictional answer to that question it is a
story too about young jay cartwright and
dramatic captain drumm and grave lyman
galt and cynical martin worth and lovely
pat wayland-all of whom i learned to
know and love during the months that i
shared their strange adventures in the world
of tomorrow

author of the infinite enemy passage to
saturn etc
rocket to nowhere

first men to the moon stand-
ing on the flag-draped platform
at the worlds fair grounds on
that sultry summer day of  jay
cartwright was aware of his hammer-
ing heart he forgot the white sea of
intent up-turned faces beyond the
ropes the hum of speech faded from
his ears he saw only the racing
hands of the watch on his wrist-rac-
ing toward the calculated second of
the start

  dwarfed in the trylons shadow
the slim bright spindle of the rocket
stood in a roped-off space of the green
parkway in the transportation zone
flash bulbs flickered and news-reel
cameras hummed

   jay cartwright was oblivious to all




startling stories

this did not care much for ceremonial
pomp he was a slender low-voiced
young man with mild blue eyes and
yellow hair he disliked publicity and
it was only for the sake of little de-
lorme designer of the rocket that he
had agreed to this staged take-off
publicity being to the diminutive in-
ventor as welcome as water to a duck

  how would it really feel a thou-
sand times cartwright had imagined
the wild intense elation of the first
man to step upon the moon drunk
with his victory over space would
it be like that and what would they
find just barren lava fields or as
delorme had hinted something more
amazing

  he knew the danger his attorneys
had been pointing it out for months
a man with a hundred and forty mil-
lions they insisted had no business
to risk his life on such a suicidal proj-
ect but cartwright always told
them other things could be more im-
portant than danger

  he started back to awareness

  oui we may be keeled delorme
was saying bowing happily at the tel-
evision cameras but if so we shall
die gladly in ze sairvice of science

  jay cartwright did not so readily
accept the idea of dying when the
newshawks pressed him for a state-
ment he forced himself to face the
staring iconoscopes and the micro-
phones and said

  i know we take a risk i am will-
ing to accept it because i think our
flight can be a useful thing today
the world is sick with unemployment
it is jittery with the dread of war
but the science that built our rocket
is international if we win the moon
it will be a victory for all the world
perhaps that will help the spirit of
men

  the applause seemed to falter

  zay do not understan little de-
lorme told him what zay want eez
heroism courage death he waved
a strutting farewell off - to zee
moon

 he followed cartwright up the
flimsy metal ladder into the cramped
pilot compartment they buckled
their harness tested the reaction

tubes and waited for the dignitaries
to scuttle for safety below

cartwright watched the chro-
nometers creeping needle it
reached the second and he lifted his
hand the jets made a cushion of blue
fire beneath and the whole rocket
screamed with a terrific vibration

  it moved savagely the straps cut
into cartwrights lean body the
breath was crushed out of him and
a spinning darkness pressed upon
him as acceleration-pressure drove
the blood from his brain

  cartwright fought the darkness and
fought for breath and foughjt that
ruthless pressure elation bubbled
in him for they were safely off

  frantically he labored to keep up
with his thousand practised tasks set-
ting and reading instruments watch-
ing a hundred dials making swift cal-
culations the bellow of the jets an-
nihilated all other sound and he
passed the figures to delorme scrawled
on bits of paper

  a needle quivered and he felt the
whole rocket shudder he scrawled a
question mark delormes face was
white he held up three fingers and
pointed anxiously down toward the
rocket compartments then his hand
came with a clutching movement to-
ward his hroat and his small body
slumped limp in the harness

  cartwright seized the dual controls
it was a two-man job to watch the
banks of instruments make all the
computations and balance the thun-
dering jets to hold the rocket on its
course but he tried to carry on
alone

  that needle flickered again back to
zero and the rocket flung sidewise
as if some gigantic hand had struck it
three equalized tubes drove the rock-
et their hundred-ton thrusts had to
be kept in perfect balance

  with the steering jets in the nose
he brought the rocket back upon the
course and battled to keep it there
and the minutes under the terrific
tension of a six-gravity acceleration
stretched into hours

  every muscle and tendon in his bat-
tered body ached a thin unnoticed
the fortress of utopia



stain of blood was hardening on hia
upper lip his head throbbed to the
roaring of the jets until almost he
envied delormes oblivion

 watching the schedule pasted to
the steel wall he gratefully cut the
acceleration as the radio-altimeter
pointed off the hundreds of miles to
five gravities four and three and
two

 when number three tube cut out
again it was easier to hold the course
with the steering jets-but with each
successive failure the tube was cut
out longer at this rate the steering
tubes would be burned out long be-
fore they reached the moon

 they were eight hundred miles
from earth when he cut the accelera-
tion to one gravity he stretched
himself thankfully in the harness
and little delorme lifted his head
mopping at a stain of blood where his
brow had struck a key

 mon dieu his thin voice was
audible above the lessened shrieking
of the jets speak of going over your
niagara falls in a barrel-that is a
couch of eiderdown

  the rocket lurched aside again

 parbleu it is number three-
probably a leaking valve on zee potas-
sium vapor element i theenk i can
feex it

 he unbuckled his harness sway-
ing weakly he let himself through the
bulkhead valve and climbed down the
ladder toward the rocket compart-
ment the automatic valve closed be-
hind him five minutes later the
little telegraph disk clattered to
emergency and then to power
off

  cartwright snatched for the firing
levers

then it was that the moon-expe-
dition begun with such confi-
dence and pomp came to its sudden
premature and obscure end

  there was a stunning concussion
the bulkhead warped upward deaf-
ened cartwright saw the flare of in-
candescent vapor outside the ports
bruised half-stunned he wound up
the little hand-powered emergency
transmitter to send the rockets last

cartwright

signal back to earth

 explosion main tubes wrecked
and delorme killed falling will
try to use steering jets-

  in what seemed like only a time-
tick the earths shadow from which
they had escaped once again embraced
them they dropped into earths at-
mosphere and into night desper-
ately cartwright tried to turn the
dizzy fall into a glide-

  crack-up

  cartwright lived his left arm brok-
en not knowing where he was and
unable to communicate with the out-
side world because the little emer-
gency transmitter was hopelessly
smashed it took him two days to
build an oxygen torch and with it he
cut his way out of the wreckage

  he looked about him and his heart
sank the rocket had fallen in a trop-
ical rain-forest the ants were al-
ready at work on delormes body he
buried it and sought water

  the rain-forest was a nightmarish
dream in his subsequent wanderings
mighty branchless boles towered in-
to it like the pillars of some dark ca-
thedral gigantic lianas writhing like
snakes in the gloom tripped and im-
peded him reeking swamps sucked


startling stories

him down into quaking black ooze
mosquitoes were humming clouds of
torture

  he grew ill fever parched his
skin dried his mouth fogged his
brain he lost the supplies he had
brought from the wreck he was
staggering in delirium when he came
through the terrible marshes to the
bend of a mighty river

  there he built a raft a totter-
ing yellow skeleton fever-maddened
starved one arm slung he flogged
himself day after day to the task the
day the raft was done the river fell
six inches the raft was immovable

  exhausted with the effort to pry it
free he flung himself down upon his
useless pile of wood he was too far
spent to curse or to sob back in the
jungle he heard a soft and now famil-
iar susuration he saw a rodent
scamper past he knew that it was
fleeing from the army ants but he
was too far gone to care

  then with all hope gone had come
the rescue it had a fantastic dream-
like quality it was like a part of his
delirium the machine that settled
with a soft deep thrumming sound
beside his raft upon the sand bar was
like nothing he had ever seen

  it was wingless there were no pro-
pellors or projecting cathion tubes
it resembled a huge silver egg there
were two shining greenish disks at
the ends painted on the side of it
was the outline of an antique clay
lamp lettered utopia inc larger
characters beneath spelled pioneer

tursing his throbbing arm
cartwright managed to sit up
on the raft he shook his unkempt
fever-buzzing head he could not
credit his senses believing that his
sick brain was fashioning visions as a
mental barrier against the whispering
horror of the ants

  but an oval door was opening in
the side of that white metal egg
metal steps rattled down and a tall
man descended them cartwrights
hollow fever-glazed eyes blinked
the vision was real

  the stranger was bronzed and erect
he glittered magnificently in an un-

familiar uniform of crimson silk stiff
with gold braid a string of polished
medals shimmered across his chest
he came with a brisk military stride
to the raft

 cartwright i presume he had
a deep crisp voice i am captain
drumm captain norman drumm
once of the army engineering corps
please accept my condolences for the
failure of your lunar flight and may
i offer you transportation back to new
york with the compliments of uto-
pia incorporated

  thanks cartwright gasped uto-
pia-what-

  he didnt hear the answer because
at that instant a wave of dizziness
overcame him and he toppled off the
raft dimly he felt this strangely uni-
formed captain lift him carry him
without effort a booming rhythm
as the queer ship lifted and then
nothing at all

  nothing - until those first disor-
dered snatches of awareness when he
lay on a narrow bed too weak to turn
himself staring at the green-and-
ivory ceiling of his room in new
yorks tropical hospital

  the illness had been graver than
he had suspected he remembered
the weak misery of his fever-parched
body the endless throb of his burst-
ing head the blurred endless proces-
sion of nurses doctors examinations
treatments-

  and then the joyous wonder of re-
turning health

  young man dont thank me little
dr corken told him you owe your
life to three people connected with
this mysterious utopia corporation
utopia- cartwright groped into
dim memory what is it

  some sort of scientific club appar-
ently the little doctor told him it
was their astronomer martin worth
who figured out by mathematics that
your rocket would fall near the negro
river in brazil-after the fleet had
been ordered to search the north at-
lantic it was their captain drumm
who found you with his plane-

  if that was an airplane i must have
been out of my mind cartwright
said
the fortress of utopia



 you were corken assured him
somewhere in the swamps you
picked up a brand-new type of ence-
phalitis we had given you up here
at the hospital when dr wayland
sent for a specimen of the virus and
made a successful serum pat way-
land is also connected with the utopia
corporation

  if you can get in touch with any
of them cartwright said i want to
thank them-materially utopia in-
corporated sounds like a humanitarian
enterprise and a hundred and forty
millions is quite a responsibility doc-
tor especially since i only inherited
it i want to invest it where it will
do the most good to mankind

presently the letter came to
him at the hospital above a
manhattan address was that odd sym-
bol of the burning lamp the puzzling
message ran

  dr corken has communicated with us
we thank you for your offer of aid and we
need it desperately for our world lives to-
day in the shadow of unsuspected danger

  if you are grateful for your life please
come to us let us show you the scientific
evidences of this approaching disaster let
us beg your aid for our plan for that is
the worlds only chance to survive the holo-
caust

                  lyman galt director
                  utopia incorporated

  the next day he was discharged as
cured

  now as the elevator flung him up-
ward toward the top of the citys tall-
est building that singular letter was
crushed in cartwrights perspiring
hand what was the utopia corpora-
tion the approaching holocaust
the plan that might save mankind
he was on his way to find out

       chapter ii
       the dead pocket

cartwright opened a door
that bore the now familiar em-
blem of the flaming antique lamp
somehow the mystery surrounding

utopia incorporated had made him
expect modernistic glass-and-chro-
mium luxury but the reception room
in which he found himself was simple
and plain

  a girl was busy at the desk remov-
ing fragile pieces of laboratory glass-
ware from a carton and checking them
off a list she was absorbed in her
task and did not look up

  cartwrights eyes passed her then
came back he stared - with good
reason the girl was exquisite a
light tan warmed her flawless skin
her hair was shining platinum her
face had a smooth doll-like perfec-
tion

  jay cartwright had been so dili-
gently pursued by certain female
seekers of that hundred and forty mil-
lions that he had come to avoid fem-
inine society but there had been
none like the girl before him he
wondered how she came to be work-
ing in an office

  he had forgotten to speak when
at last she did look up at him he saw
that her eyes were a soft clear blue
altogether she almost took his breath
in a sugar-sweet quiet voice she re-
marked innocently

  after all this isnt the waxworks


startling stories

  cartwright turned red and gulped
he fumbled awkwardly for galts let-
ter and told her his name

  oh the girl stared at him with
widened blue eyes he had an odd
impression that her baby-face was de-
liberately vacant lymans is the
second door

  the platinum splendor of her head
bent again cartwright was puzzled
by a momentary sparkle of interest
he had seen in her eyes

  you would almost think he told
himself that she was conscious

beyond the second door he
found himself in a larger office
the windows overlooked the ragged
canyons of manhattan this room too
looked simple utilitarian worn sit-
ting behind a cluttered desk was a
big tired-looking man

  youre cartwright he rose smil-
ing i came to see you at the trop-
ical im lyman galt

  he looked forty dark hair was re-
treating from his temples his un-
pressed suit was yielding to the mus-
cular mass of his body his collar was
open to show a powerful neck his
wide brown face was criss-crossed
with wrinkles of fatigue and his dark
tired eyes looked very solemn

  i got your letter cartwright
smoothed the crumpled envelope in
his fingers it had a mighty serious
sound he searched that broad wor-
ried face about this-holocaust
very serious indeed

  something in the deep timbre of
galts voice sent a queer little shudder
through cartwright he caught his
breath and sat waiting

  i should tell you rang that sol-
emn voice that we exerted our efforts
to save your life in order that we
might be justified in calling on you
for aid yet we cant ask you to join
us out of gratitude alone-the thing
is too big for that

  well cartwright moved impa-
tiently in his chair just what is this
menace and what is it that your
mysterious utopia corporation plans
to do about it

  galt sat impassively behind the big
desk

  first he said i must tell you
something about my associates - the
three who jointly saved your life
but you have already met pat way-
land who made the serum-
cartwright shook his head

 no but im anxious to thank
him

  galt smiled solemnly and his dark
unkempt head moved a little toward
the reception room

  pat he said is for patricia
eh cartwright gulped i
thought-

  others have been deceived galt
told him gravely that is an eccen-
tricity of pats she isnt easy to un-
derstand

  he stared for a moment silently at
the door she is a beautiful woman
and a splendid scientist he said
slowly it is better to forget that
she is a woman just remember that
she is a biologist who ranks with men-
del and darwin a psychologist who is
the peer of watson and pavlov
with a faint and somewhat bitter
smile galt shrugged

  pats brilliant discoveries he said
form the very heart of our plan
and cartwright prompted him
impatiently -the plan

  it seemed to cartwright that a film
of odd reticence obscured the frank-
ness of galts dark eyes they looked
away evasively galts big fingers
drummed nervously on the desk he
started to speak checked himself

 well cartwright said you
asked me here to tell me about some
approaching danger to the world and
a plan to avoid it im listening
galt nodded

  first before we go into any details
of the plan i want you to see for your-
self the scientific evidence of the ap-
proaching holocaust it is a thing so
tremendous that i could not ask you
to accept it on my word alone dr
worth and captain drumm will be
here at dusk to take you to our ob-
servatory you met drumm of course
in the jungle worth is our astron-
omer it was he who discovered the
menace of the holocaust

  drumm cartwright made a be-
wildered gesture the memory is
the fortress of utopia



sort of mixed up with my delirium
he said i remember him-a big man
in a queer uniform i erroneously
thought he came in a machine shaped
like an egg

  he did said galt that was our
geoflexor the pioneer

  cartwrights blue eyes blinked
worth discovered the principle of
geodesic inflection twelve years-ago
galt told him it offers a means of
direct reaction against the structure
of space itself drumm helped design
the pioneer it is an ellipsoid pro-

pelled by the space-warp created by
the two terminal geodes-

  cartwright got slowly and unstead-
ily to his feet supporting himself
with his hands he leaned over the
desk he had a peculiar uncomfort-
able feeling of tiny cold feet chasing
up and down his spine

  we were trying to fly a rocket to
the moon he whispered when you
had-that

  thats it galt said we first
reached the moon eleven years ago
worths observatory was finished the
same year-its on the central peak of
arzachel between ptolemy and ty-
cho drumm himself has also been to

mars and venus but the desperate
urgency of the situation has left no
time for any idle explorations

cartwright gazed unbeliev-
ingly at the small simple office
with its neat rows of filing cabinets
along the wall he saw a long panel
of framed photographs and blinked
at them

  my few visitors galt said usual-
ly take them to be imaginative draw-
ings

  cartwright rubbed at his forehead
eleven years-that long he whis-
pered captain drumm has been out
exploring space-while the world was
wallowing through the depression
he gave a short mirthless little
laugh

  so even if we had made it we
wouldnt have been the first poor
little delorme-he died for nothing

  why say that galt asked sol-
emnly utopia incorporated will
keep its secrets intact the world will
never know what we have done
but what is the reason for your se-
crecy cartwright demanded in be-
wilderment

  you will understand galt prom-
ised when you learn the plan mean-
time ill summarize the reason as a
deep mistrust of contemporary civili-
zation-so-called

  his voice went on hollowly

  could we give the geoflexor to the
world - knowing that its chief use
would be to rain bombs on cities
he shrugged and rose youve a
couple of hours before dusk would
you care to look at drumms martian
notes and photographs

  when two men entered the office
at this point cartwright recognized
the big adventurer at once tall
broad-shouldered drumm was mag-
nificent in the crimson-and-gold of his
fantastic uniform he had crisp red-
dish hair earnest blue eyes shone
from the tanned stern simplicity of
his face

  cartwright his voice was a
hearty boom so youre to see the
moon after all

  he introduced martin worth the
astronomer was a small thin man his

martin worth


startling stories

skin was very white his retreating
hair heavy sloping brows and small
pointed beard made a series of black
vs upon it his dark eyes had a cyn-
ical twinkle and his nearly fleshless
face bore an expression of perpetual
sardonic amusement

  moving with the effortless gliding
grace of a professional dancer worth
came to cartwright and shook his
hand all his motions were silent
quick deft

  cartwright i recall you as part of
a very interesting mathematical prob-
lem his voice had a hushed almost
whispering quality i understand
that galt has chosen you to share our
distressing discovery - if you will
come with us to the moon

  on a walled terrace outside beneath
a striped awning they found the pio-
neer cartwright thought it looked
oddly tiny to be a ship of space

an egg of silvered metal twelve
feet in diameter and eighteen
long criss-crossed with riveted seams
pierced with small round ports
tipped at each end with a massive
disk of red copper alloy

  folding steps led them through the
heavy oval door up through a tiny
lock-chamber they emerged upon a
flat deck which divided the interior a
little below the center long seats
and compact cabinets were built
against the curve of the dome

  an intricate-looking control board
curved across one end with larger ob-
servation panels of thick fused quartz
set in the steel hull above it striding
toward it drumm paused to touch the
curving metal overhead

  two inches of a special nickel-
chrome steel he said laminated
welded and riveted-forty tons of it
there are automatic shutters of the
same for all the ports

  little martin worth smiled his sar-
donic siftile

  and still he said softly a forty-
gram meteor would smash quite a hole
in it

  drumms laugh rang loud under the
dome

  your viewing with alarm wont
scare cartwright he said he has

been to space in something worse than
this he spun a bright wheel and
the heavy door clanged behind them
the valve is sealed he said with
five hundred pounds of pressure in a
flexible hydraulic duct

 a motor beneath the deck hummed
in a rising crescendo then abruptly
the deck quivered to a mighty muf-
fled drumming reverberation cart-
wright felt an odd little lurch and
wondered why the ship didnt rise
he stepped toward one of the ports

 i thought-

  his voice became a sob of dismay
he grasped frantically at the sliding
emergency shutter for he could see
the bright-lit familiar panorama be-
neath him-and it was tilting crazily

  a giddy faintness seized him as the
surface of the planet seemed to spin
from beneath the earth was beside
them beneath there was only a bot-
tomless and terrible abyss of stars

  better look back inside worths
suave voice advised

  cartwright did so and his vertig-
inous terror vanished

  i felt just as if the earth was slid-
ing out from under us he whispered

  a natural illusion the little as-
tronomer told him the entire ship
is included in the propulsive field of
the main terminal geodes-those cop-
per disks at the ends of the hull
since each atom of the ship and our
bodies is accelerated equally by the
geoflexion reaction there is no sense
of motion

  but for our comfort and conve-
nience aboard we have a secondary set
of geodes installed below the deck
our bodies are included in their field
while the hull is not the result is a
sense of force which we adjust to an
approximation of earth-gravity

 cartwright sank upon one of the
long seats

  and i thought our cathion rocket
was something modern

 the pioneer isnt any rocking
chair worths thin face was twisted
with his sardonic grin a meteor the
size of your hat could smash us into
a ring around tb t moon and just
wait till youvt been in a dead
pocket
the fortress of utopia



smii ng captain drumm swung
ba - from the controls

  don t let him get your goat cart-
wright he boomed mart sees the
dark side-he was made that way
but weve been in dead pockets before
and got out again

  cartwright looked uneasily at
worths satanic face

  what is a dead pocket

  there are areas said the little as-
tronomer usually in the vicinity of
strong gravitational fields where the
geoflexor drive doesnt work the
field simply doesnt mesh and there
is a resistance in the coils that heats
them dangerously if we happen to
hit anything while the geodes are
dead or if a coil burns out-

  he shrugged and all the vs grew
sharper and more sinister on his face

  dont listen called the hearty
voice of captain drumm marts just
a black pessimist he cant cross the
street without expecting a taxi to get
him

  but cartwright remained uneasy
the rush of air grew to a scream
about them and faded cartwright
went back to the port and conquered
that vertigo he found the lights of
the metropolis a contracting star on
the field of darkness behind

  were already out of the atmos-
phere he said and it was more like
a question whats the power

  the little astronomer lifted a hatch
cover set flush in the deck that
drumming reverberation welled louder
from below

  the power tubes kneeling to
point worth raised his voice in the
dark cramped space beneath the deck
a row of tall transparent cylinders
shone dimly the silver cathode is
at the focal point of an intense geodic
field the atomic fields are warped
and there is a swift emission of elec-
trons they are collected by the grid-
element above the potential is four
hundred volts the out-put of each tube
about two thousand kilowatts

  cartwright swayed again to his feet
atomic power he gasped and
you had this back in 

  then he groped at one of the long
brass hand rails for the ship had

lurched sickeningly it seemed to
drop hang and drop again he
looked faintly at martin worth

  a dead pocket

  the little astronomer grinned sar-
donically

  not yet-were just feeling the
edge of one

  cartwright clung to the seat he
watched the broad red back of cap-
tain drumm the big space pilot had
risen off his seat he was leaning over
the controls gold braid flashed as his
hands moved with a lightning skill

  chin up cartwright he boomed
well come through

  cartwright looked uncertainly at
the thin somewhat diabolical smile of
martin worth he was glad that he
was a good sailor then he began to
have a disquieting doubt that he was
so good after all

  then the ship dropped-and didnt
stop dropping

  a gong clattered on the instrument
panel and there was a sudden reek of
burned insulation drumm was des-
perately busy at the controls there
was a deafening head-splintering
crash and cartwrights world turned
black

       chapter iii
the holocaust to come
i ------   

jay cartwright was definite-
ly surprised later to find himself
lying unharmed on one of the long
bunk-like seats the machinery of
the pioneer was drumming evenly
again he saw martin worths sar-
donic grin

  never mind cartwright

  blue eyes smiling out of his deep-
bronzed face captain drumm looked
back from the controls

  a meteor the size of a good par-
ticle of dust always sounds like the
end of the world he said and that
feeling of weightlessness when the
gravity-coils are dead is a thing the
body has got to get adjusted to j ust
take it easy and well soon be on the
moon


startling stories

  cartwright stared in fascination at
the bright mystery of the moons ap-
proaching face which he and delorme
had striven so vainly to reach he
found the vast cragged ring of arza-
chel-it was hard to think that any
human work would be waiting for
them there

  captain drumm set the pioneer
down gently upon the central peak
the throb of the geodes was suddenly
still

  hold on warned drumm im
cutting the gravity field

  cartwright understood that caution
when the reaction of unaccustomed
muscles flung him painfully up against
the metal dome he rubbed his head
something about weighing twenty-five
pounds made him feel queerly giddy
his stomach was uneasy

  through a port he glimpsed the
stark moonscape it was all high-
lights and blackness he forgot all
his discomfort in a voiceless awe at its
stern splendor

  worth had flung open the inner
door of the little air-lock off their
hooks he was dragging bulky suits of
stiff white-painted fabric he thrust
one of them at cartwright

  my size ought to fit you he said
it goes on like oldtime underwear
captain drumm helped him into it
there was a double zipper up the
front and the seam was sealed with
air pressure in a flexible tube

  the breathing mixture - oxygen
and helium-is in this shoulder tank
drumm informed him adjust the
valve until you can breathe comfort-
ably the main tank is good for three
hours the emergency two more
the tiny air-lock let them out one
at a time cartwright lost his balance
as he stepped down upon the moon
soared up again in an involuntary leap
drumm caught him for a moment
he was breathless gasping

  youve forgotten your valve
drumm turned it for cartwright
was lost in wonder

  the silver of it blinding in the
westering sun the pioneer lay upon a
rugged irregular summit many acres
in extent a full mile below-so far
that its convexity was instantly vis-

ible-lay the crater floor

   a cruel and lifeless desert burning
 gray-white under the sun riven with
 ragged cracks pitted with thousands
 of circular craterlets

   thirty miles and more away the
 walls of arzachel thrust up the
 jagged peaks beneath the sun were
 etched in a fantastic dead-black sil-
 houette and they flung an ink-black
 ragged shadow far across the plain of
 hell

   the eastward rim raised pinnacles
 of fire against the appalling blackness
 of the star-hazed sky all colors were
 sombre dull-red brown smoky yel-
 low

cartwright flung back his
head in the stiff helmet and
found the earth it was northward
from the zenith a huge broad crescent
mistily blue-green

  come worth had touched his
 inflated sleeve and the sound vibra-
 tions were transmitted faintly the
 observatory

  waddling in the huge white-
 painted suit he made a fantastic fig-
 ure cartwright followed him they
 rounded the silver egg of the ship and
 climbed a narrow trail seeking to ad-
 just his muscles to one-sixth their
 usual burden cartwright lurched
 stumbled suddenly he lost his bal-
 ance toppled off the trail

   spinning downward into a chasm
 of awesome night he screamed-and
 knew there was no air to carry his cry
 he plunged down for an endless time
 picturing the sharp fangs of rock that
 waited down on the crater floor

   then a lasso settled around him

   i ran away to the west when i was
 thirteen captain drumm buckled
 the coiled lariat back to his belt and
 remember you fall only about two feet
 the first second here

   thanks gasped cartwright

   at the top of the trail on the high-
 est ragged peak a silvered dome flung
 off blinding lances of the sun worth
 smubec side a flimsy-seeming section
 of bright metal to reveal a powerful
 telescope

   only a twenty-four-inch mirror
 worth said but the perfect seeing
the fortress of utopia

ready said pal five seconds of mathe-
matics  chapter v

degrees from the double cluster
look at the stars at the top of the field
notice anything

  fainter maybe

  worths whisper was solemn
dont you see that their light is
diffused

  theyre misty cartwright agreed
they seem to have little halos
exactly said the astronomer
because they are shining through the
edges of a cloud and there are other
stars that have been blotted out com-

here makes it more effective than the
largest instrument on earth and we
have a new fine-grain emulsion with
sixty times the speed of anything used
on earth which alone makes it the
equivalent of the new two-hundred
inch reflector they are building in cal-
ifornia

  his whispering voice was suddenly
grave

  but this is what we came to show
you

 the great tube swung toward the
northward horizon the floor-platform
lifted them worth made cartwright
seat himself at the eyepiece at first
he saw only a circle of utter black
scattered with a few tiny hard atoms
of light

  worth touched his arm and sound
came

  notice the visibility-any astron-
omer would give half his life for one
night here this is in perseus three


startling stories

pletely because they are behind the
cloud

  what sort of cloud

  to the eye even with telescope it
is no more than a shadow on the stars
but here is a plate we took with the
fast emulsion and a twenty-hour ex-
posure

  worth snapped a switch in a large
square cabinet a light went on trans-
mitted rays illuminated a large photo-
graphic plate the same pattern of
stars burned out brilliantly and
across them was a black and ominous
cloud

  the astronomers arm went tense
  there it is-a dark nebula

the center of it was a black globu-
lar mass that was flattened into
a disk and long vague spiral arms
were flying from the edges of the disk

  staring cartwright repressed a
faint shudder there was something
appalling about that cloud of dark-
ness the spiral arms of it looked
somehow like the groping tentacles of
some unpleasant monster

  i give up fighting that shud-
dery feeling he tried to grin what
is it

 worths dark eyes beyond the
round face-plate in his helmet looked
so grave that cartwright hastily
erased the grin

  a stellar nebula said the little
astronomer a cloud of gas and dust
and meteoric debris loosely held in
its own gravitational field

  it is the sort of condensation ac-
cording to cosmogony that should
have formed a star perhaps its mass
was a little too small or its angular
moment a little too great perhaps
billions of years from now it will yet
give birth to a star

  the bulky white suit made a little
shrugging gesture

  that doesnt matter

 well demanded cartwright
what is it that does

  the fact that the nebula is ap-
proaching the earth said worths
suave whisper my analysis of its
spectral shift shows a relative radial
velocity of nearly seventy miles a sec-
ond and it has no perceptible proper

motion that means that it is moving
to intersect the path of the sun and
the planets in lyra collision is in-
evitable

  collision cartwright shook his
head peered and what will hap-
pen

  to the solar system very little
said the astronomer the nebula is
quite diffuse its matter is scattered
through a disk sixty billion miles
across its mean density is what we
should call a fairly hard vacuum the
sun will surely pass through un-
harmed i think none of the planets
will be lost-although the orbits of
the asteroids and some of the smaller
moons are apt to be affected by me-
teoric collisions but for men the
outlook is less cheerful

  in the chill darkness beneath that
metal dome upon the moon cart-
wright shuddered as if the deadly
shadow of that stellar cloud had al-
ready fallen upon him he clutched
at worths stiff-clad arm

 what- his voice was a croak-
what will happen to mankind

  worths big helmet nodded at the
telescope

he picture is quite clear came
his whispering voice the first
thing streamers of dust will absorb
the sunlight first the ultra-violet
finally even the red the sun will
turn crimson and then fade out

 that unnatural night will be a
warning of the end for several
months perhaps the planet will be
gripped in its bitter cold atmos-
pheric moisture will fall as snow
probably even the seas will freeze
over

  but then as the earth drives into
the denser clouds there will be heat
again-and light that last day will
be more terrible than the night for
its light will come from rains of
meteors

  and that will be the end-a hail of
fire the meteors falling ever faster
will burn the oxygen out of the at-
mosphere they will beat down on an
asphyxiated- world their heat will
vaporize li  seas finally it will
probably fu e even the imcking des-
the fortress of utopia



erts that will then cc ver all the
planet

  worth stared out of th dome for a
moment toward that inv ible speck
in the silver-dusted splendor of per-
seus

  after a few years he said at last
the sun will emerge unchanged be-
yond the cloud the planets will still
attend it but no spark of life will
survive to repopulate them-unless
our plan succeeds

  what can men do cartwright
shuddered what can they do
against-that

  we have a plan worth assured

him galt organized the utopia cor-
poration to carry it through we have
been working on it ten years with
your help we have a chance-just a
good chance

  one thing cartwright said ab-
rutly how long have we

  the astronomer seemed to hesitate
peering into the darkness of his hel-
met cartwright was unable to see his
face his suave voice when at last
it came faintly through the contact of
the suits seemed curiously evasive
my computations are not yet com-
plete and the boundaries of the neb-

ula as you can see for yourself are
rather indefinite

  but you have an idea cartwright
insisted is it two years five
ten

i can promise that there will be
time to carry out the plan said
worth but very little to spare
then how long will your plan
take

  galt will tell you the astronomer
said when you get back to earth

chapter iv
the fortress on the moon

little martin worth an-
nounced that he was going to re-
main on the moon to continue his ob-
servations of the approaching nebula
he showed cartwright a twelve-foot
ball of white-painted metal half
buried in the rock below the observa-
tory

  an air-chamber he said ive a
bunk in there food and water cyl-
inders of oxygn and helium my
books and instruments i have lived
here half the time for the last ten
years

 cartwright and captain drumm
shook his thick-gloved hand and
climbed back down the trail to the
argent egg of the pioneer the valve
clanged behind them and the little
ship lurched and boomed away on the
earthward flight

  splendid in his gold-and-crimson
drumm grinned back from the control
board his stern bronzed face was
firmly set but his steely blue eyes
shone joyously

  some job ahead of us eh he
shouted as big a job as four fight-
ing men and a girl ever tackled
youre lucky to be one of us jay
we-

  the mighty thrum of the geodes
faltered and the little ship dropped
cartwrights stomach felt very un-
comfortable again and he snatched
with trembling fingers for the brass
handrails

 captain drumm spun a bright


startling stories

wheel tapped colored keys carefully
inched two small levers forward that
sickening fall ceased as abruptly as it
had begun the powerful throb of
the geodes rolled evenly again

  some sport eh the tall pilot
looked around grinning you never
know when youre going to hit a dead
pocket-marts detector didnt work
no particular danger-unless you ram
something while youre out of con-
trol or let the coils burn out but
theyre always good for a thrill
cartwrights bewildered mind tried
to sum up the details of the last few
amazing hours however you took
them these people who called them-
selves utopia incorporated were a
pretty remarkable group

  there was little worth with his
suave whispering voice and that dis-
quieting satanic grin casually ma-
rooning himself a quarter of a million
miles from the nearest man if any-
thing went wrong with his flimsy
pressure-suit or his twelve-foot bub-
ble of air-

  cartwright tried not to shudder
there was pat wayland the su-
per-biolgoist who contrived to look
like a particularly gorgeous and par-
ticularly dumb show-girl-and then
if you took her for one said things
that hurt if she knew about the com-
ing holocaust that helped to explain
her but cartwright still wondered

  captain drumm himself splendid
and fantastic man of action who
seemed to rejoice blithely in every
emergency that called for his calm
courage his strength and his skill
those bright-polished boots of his had
trodden the mystery of venus and the
deserts of mars

 and lyman galt the big tired
man who was director of mysterious
utopia incorporated the planner of
its mysterious plan cartwright won-
dered about galt was it the tortur-
ing knowledge of the holocaust ahead
that had hollowed his dark eyes lined
his weary face

the dark shadow of that coiling
stellar cloud haunted cartwright
it was like a monstrous dark serpen-
tine thing crawling and lurking amid

his thoughts

 over and over again he saw
worths picture of the end the last
red twilight and the extinction of the
sun the months of freezing night
and then the final rain of meteors
that would illumine the ghastly end
of man

  what possible refuge could there
be

 what plan could galt have
planned

 why cartwright wondered had
worth been so evasive about the time
that was left the thought flashed in
his mind that all this might be a fraud
to get his hundred and forty millions
instantly he dismissed the suspicion
whatever galt and his asociates were
certainly they were not common crimi-
nals

  he did wish however that worth
had been more frank

  it was three oclock in the morn-
ing when captain drumm brought the
pioneer gently down on the terrace
outside the manhattan offices of
utopia incorporated but the lights
inside were still on weary-eyed
lyman galt looked up from a moun-
tain of papers on his desk

  ive seen the nebula cartwright
told him worth told me about this
disaster he expects-though he was
too reticent about when he expects it
now i am ready to hear about your
plan

 galts dark red-rimmed eyes
studied his face

  you are willing to consider invest-
ing your fortune in the plan

  if it offers any reasonable hope of
escape from the holocaust that worth
described-i am but im free to say
that my pessimism is deep

  once so we are told galt said
slowly when men had warning of a
deluge of water they built an ark in
which the seed of life was preserved
now wc are threatened with another
deluge-a deluge of fire in a prop-
erly constructed refuge isnt it possi-
ble  lat men might survive again and
eraer e to build a new world

 his hollow eyes looked musingly
far away

  to build he ended a real uto-
the fortress of utopia



       

pia

  and that-is the plan murmured
cartwright

  galt nodded

  yes we are going to build a cita-
del on the moon it will be a fortress
against all the possible vicissitudes of
the holocaust in it we shall pre-
serve the selected flower of mankind
and other life to seed the world again
and a record of all the best things man
has done in every field of art and
science

  but can any building cartwright
objected survive the cataclysm that
worth expects

  galt nodded again

  we have been ten years drawing
up the plan and it is complete he
pulled open a drawer of the scarred
desk here are the blueprints of the
citadel

  wait said cartwright ive an-
other question to ask-the one that
worth evaded how long have we to
build this citadel

  the plan allows a year

  that isnt what i mean cart-
wright leaned over the desk how
long is it before the earth will collide
with the nebula

galts broad frank face twisted
with a little expression of pain
and his dark eyes looked away from
cartwright

  worth assures me that we have
time to carry out the plan-if we be-
gin at once beyond that he isnt defi-
nite his observations are unfinished
you know

  cartwright hesitated shrugged

  well if you cant answer that
question heres another-why build
the fortress on the moon

  again galt looked away

  for several reasons he said at
last first secrecy is essential to
avoid a useless premature panic sec-
ond the work can be carried forward
more rapidly under the moons
lighter gravitation third and most
important the moon will be a safer
location after the holocaust begins
because the earths gravitational field
will catch most of the meteors that
would otherwise strike the moons

earthward face now the blue-
prints

  somehow that explanation was not
quite convincing to cartwright
there was still an evasion in galts
manner but he knew no way past it
yielding he bent over the plans

  the citadel will be built on and
under the central peak of arzachel
where worths observatory now
stands galt told him in fact well
keep the same observatory but protect
it with a heavier dome

  his thick fingers pointed out a cross
section of the peak

  in this heavily armored building
on the peak will be landing facilities
for the pioneer observation rooms
and living accommodations the
greater part of the citadel however
will be down here at this point nine
thousand feet below

  these elevators through a series
of heavy valves will communicate
with the galleries here or vaults i
should say they will be lined with
reinforced concrete - as secure as
modern engineering can make them
against every possible disaster

  these vaults will hold our books
pictures sound-film containers - all
the treasury of modern civilization
our stores of food and implements
will be there the tanks of water and
oxygen the power plants

  and how many inquired cart-
wright are you going to admit to the
second ark

  once again galt looked uncomfort-
ably away

  only a small group he said we
have not yet settled the exact num-
ber his dark eyes swung back to
cartwright with a challenging force
now he said you have heard the
plan will you help us

  cartwright met his eyes

  theres something that worth
didnt tell me he said something
that you havent told me if i am go-
ing to invest a hundred million dol-
lars in your plan dont you think i
have the right to know all about it
galts hollow blood-shot eyes re-
turned his gaze steadily

  believe me cartwright i have
told you all i can he hesitated and


startling stories

when he spoke again a huskiness had
come into his voice i hope very
much that you decide to join us

he plan of course will go on
-whether you help or not
drumm is willing to turn pirate with
the pioneer we have several inter-
esting gadgets that you havent seen
we can get the money we must have
but wed lose time and id like to
have you cartwright with the cor-
poration

  cartwright was slowly nodding

  i believe you galt he said i
like your associates and after all i
owe them my life im sorry for
whatever keeps you from speaking
more fully but im with you-all the
way

  thank you jay-for mankind

 for mankind echoed jay cart-
wright softly

  for he thought he had seen sud-
denly the reason for all of worths
and galts evasions the utopia cor-
poration obviously could save only a
few human beings in that refuge on
the moon theirs would be the su-
preme responsibility of building uto-
pia after the holocaust for that
great task only perfect human speci-
mens must be selected

  the whole mystery cartwright had
decided was simply that worth and
galt hated to tell him that he wasnt
fit to be taken

  it was on his tongue to tell galt
what he had guessed but a mans dis-
like of emotional scenes made him
keep silent after all cartwright
thought he was not exceptional if
not for those inherited millions he
might have been driving a taxi

 and if he didnt belong to the
flower of humanity at least he could
be big enough to stand back and make
room for those who did

       chapter v
       the ideophore

but the next day finding his pa-
tient mysteriously exhausted

dr corken ordered jay cartwright
to florida to complete his conva-
lescence forced to keep silent about
his midnight trip to the moon cart-
wright objected in vain he carried
the appeal to galt

  i want to help with the plan he
told the big tired man im going to
sign the checks of course but be-
sides that i want to really do some-
thing

  all right galt promised after
you come back

  basking on the floridian beaches
reading in newspapers the familiar
stories of murders strikes and
threatened wars cartwright found
that the utopia corporation faded
into a curious unreality the night
on the moon seemed a dream worths
stellar nebula became a nightmare
that he wanted to forget a doubt
arose in him

  could it be possible that all this
world - of people who fought wars
and fell in love and worked in fac-
tories and made millions and pan-
handled dimes for cups of coffee and
caught the eight-fifty and climbed
mountains to see the sunrise and sued
each other for divorce and jammed
the subways and jumped out of win-
dows and risked their lives for duty
and fixed traffic tickets and held up
banks and complained about high
taxes and played in parks and delib-
erated in the senate and looked in
shop windows - could it be that all
these people were doomed unsuspect-
ingly just by a tiny shadow on the
stars

 tanned and stronger his arm as
good as new again cartwright carried
that doubt with him back to new
york

  he found a little cubicle waiting for
him in the offices of utopia incorpor-
ated on the desk was a pile of bills
for tools and steel and cement and
wages and electrical machinery and
books and microfilm copies and scien-
tific instruments that reached a stag
gering-and very real-total

  with their story of a huge work 
progress those invoices swept lis
doubt away he spent a morning sign-
ing checks when the desk was clear
the fortress of utopia



he went into galts office and said
  im ready for that job

  the big director smiled across his
cluttered desk

  captain drumm has been ferrying
our materials and labor to the moon
galt said but really his time is all
needed to boss the construction
there his tired hollow eyes studied
cartwright do you want to fly the
pioneer to the moon tonight
cartwright gaped astonished
tonight

  weve a barge load of steel wait-
ing in the yard at youngstown galt
told him and drumm must get back
to his job

 i learned to pilot delormes
rocket cartwright said uncertainly
but the geoflexor looks terribly com-
plicated with those dead pockets to
get out of and all i wouldnt know
how to start-not tonight

something made galts dark
eyes twinkle

  pat can fix you up he said with
her ideophore

  cartwright stared at him

  whats that

  youll soon know from experience
-and its an experience you wont
forget ill call drumm to supply the
copy

  cartwright had not seen pat way-
lands offices tables in the small
rooms were crowded with micro-
scopes centrifuges glassware but
most of the equipment was unfamiliar
to him

  pat wayland herself rose abruptly
from a bench covered with the delicate
glistening metal parts of some small
machine and several odd-shaped
vacuum tubes her platinum head
was high she smiled at galt and
captain drumm with a disarming
sweetness in her wide blue eyes

  yes this is the convention head-
quarters she said limpidly and
im not a bit busy i was just idling
away the time looking for a couple of
bugs in the tau-ray im glad you
came along-ill be wanting to test it
now darling protested captain
drumm you wouldnt want to make
us forget that we love you

  her doll-face dimpled to a sac-
charine smile

  just wait and see

  galts big brown hand made a little
hasty gesture cartwright thought
that his dark tired face showed a
flicker of pain

  will you hook up the ideophore
for us pat he asked captain
drumm is going to teach cartwright
here how to fly the pioneer

 okay chief her smile was
dazzling but the lesson had better
be limited to astrogation if cart-
wright picks up any of that honey bee
stuff its the tau-ray for both of
them

  dont worry your pretty little
head returned captain drumm do
you think i want a rival

  remember cap the girl said
sweetly just what the tau-ray is
her serene blue eyes smiled breath-
takingly into cartwrights face this
is the ideophore just sit down
cartwright stepped back uneasily
from the thing she pointed out it
looked disturbingly like an electric
chair there was a huge shining hel-
met connected by a heavy cable with a


startling stories

tall black cabinet on wheels

  wha-what is it

  pat wayland beckoned again

  if you really want to know-she
smiled ominously-ill give you five
seconds of radio-psychology which
is as much as a college could teach you
in eight years-if any colleges taught
radio-psychology

  better not take too much at once
galt advised him or youll have a
splitting head ill try to explain
something about it you remember
the ten-cycle brain waves recently dis-
covered well pat has found some
subtler higher-frequency brain emana-
tions the ideophore makes use of
them briefly it can be described as
an electrical educator

towledge and memory
mm as pat has proved are really
matters of bipolar moment and intra-
molecular potential within the neu-
rone cells her brain-ray pick-up
scans that electrical pattern of knowl-
edge very much as the electron beam
scans the photo-electric image in an
iconoscope the process of course
is far more delicate and complex but
knowledge is converted in essentially
the same way into electrical impulses

  those impulses can be transmitted
through a special coaxial cable they
can be amplified with special electron
tubes and finally through a phe-
nomenon that pat calls neuro-
resonance they can set up new bipolar
moments and intra-molecular poten-
tials in another brain

  the ideophore that is can pick up
knowledge from one brain and trans-
fer it almost instantly to another
there is a delicate system of tuning
which with the cooperation of the
teacher makes it possible to select the
subject to be taught galt turned to
the girl is that right pat

  pat wayland smiled at him

  you could do with about ten sec-
onds of radio-psychology yourself
she looked at cartwright and her
platinum head nodded at the ideo-
phore reluctantly q artwright
climbed into the massive chair there
were padded straps for his wrists and
ankles for your own protection

pat said sweetly there is an invol-
untary spastic muscular reaction

  the alarming helmet was lowered
over his head captain drumm stood
behind- the chair with his head be-
tween two polished metal plates pat
took her place at the intricate controls
on the wheeled cabinet motor-con-
verters hummed and then a keen
ominous whine stabbed into cart-
wrights brain

  ready said pat five seconds
of mathematics and the theory and
practise of astrogation now

  cartwright heard the switch click-
and then his world was shattered un-
der an avalanche of agony a million
searing needles probed into his brain
intolerable flame blinded him thun-
der bellowed in his ears

  he tried to count the eternal sec-
onds one and two but he felt as
if the torture had already lasted min-
utes hours his awareness was flung
away on a hurricane of flame he was
blanked out

  then it was over galt helped lift
the helmet free his bruised aching
wrists and ankles sweat drenched
him he relaxed in the big chair pant-
ing

  if you want something tough
boomed captain drumm have mart
worth give you twenty seconds of as-
tronomy-that would burst a billiard
ball or try half a minute of pats
own bio-psychology

  the throbbing ache stilled in cart-
wrights head a few hours later
when he stood beside captain drumm
at the curved control-board of the
pioneer he was a little surprised to
find that he knew the exact function
of every dial and wheel and lever

  without a word of prompting he
checked all the instruments climbed
down through the hatch to inspect the
power tubes and the geoflexor circuits
in the cramped space beneath the deck
and finally lifted the pioneer smoothly
into the twilight above manhattan

  i dont understand it cartwright
shook a bewildered yellow head
but i know how to fly the ship pats
ideophore is a wonderful gadget
pat-drumms voice was grave-
is altogether a wonderful person
the fortress of utopia



ou love her dont you
cartwright looked into
drumms bronzed face somehow i
picked up that impression along with
the science of geodic astrogation
drumms red head nodded soberly
my mind must have slipped a mo-
ment-its hard to forget that you love
pat wayland i think all three of us
do i try to make a joke out of it
god help you if you ever leave your-
self open to pats peculiar humor
mart worth never says anything but
he keeps her picture out there on the
moon but probably its the most
serious with galt

  and how does pat feel

  the pioneer just then lurched
upon the brink of a dead pocket with
a swift and almost unconscious skill
cartwright returned the geoflexors
with no thought of that vertiginous
sickness that had troubled him at first
he brought the little ship past the
danger and looked again at captain
drumm

  i dont understand pat

  drumm shrugged

  who does the simplest theory
is that the woman in her quarreled
with the scientist-and the scientist
won my own theory is that she has
something in her life that she never
speaks about i dont know-

  he sighed and the red-uniformed
shoulders drew straight

  you avoided that dead pocket very
well jay you can pick up the barge
at youngstown and head for the moon
im going to sleep

  he sprawled himself on one of the
long seats against the curving hull
and pulled a rug over him

  cartwright had wondered how hun-
dreds of workmen and thousands of
tons of material were carried to the
moon in the tiny pioneer now he
knew the answer they werent
with far more power than was needed
to lift herself alone the little geo-
flexor served as a tug-boat of space

  the barge waiting by the night-
shrouded railway siding in ohio was
a white-painted forty-foot sphere of
welded steel cartwright dropped the
pioneer upon it made fast a magnetic
coupling waved at a bewildered-look-

ing yard clerk and then soared up into
the night toward the tarnished plat-
ter of the waning moon

  four hours later dropping toward
the moon cartwright was amazed at
the change that a month-and a few
of his millions-had made in the cen-
tral peak of arzachel now a hive of
activity busy figures in white
swarmed over the mountain big elec-
tric-powered caterpillar shovels had
already leveled the mile-high summit
and the excavations were already in
progress for he saw gray slopes of
rubble beneath the black mouths of
half a dozen tunnels

  a row of white spheres lying on
the pitted crater floor made quarters
for the men light awnings covered
the machine shops there cable-borne
telephers carried workmen and ma-
terials to the tunnels and the new
mesa above

  captain drumm put on a white pres-
sure suit shook cartwrights hand
and climbed out of the pioneer cart-
wright uncoupled the barge picked
up an empty and started back to
earth dawn was breaking when he
dropped the little geoflexor on its ter-
race in manhattan and took a taxi to
his hotel

that night he flew another load
to the moon and every night
he tried to accustom himself to think-
ing of the holocaust sometimes
after he had waked and breakfasted in
the afternoon he sat for a little while
in the hotel lobby just watching peo-
ple

  he couldnt help staring at people
with a kind of horrified fascination
it was terrible to know that all the
dates the deals the jobs the shows
the dinners the shopping tours the
sights the visits to the fair-that all
those things seeming so important
meant nothing at all

  sometimes he was tormented with
a wild irrational desire to stand up and
scream out the maddening truth
the holocaust is coming
you are doomed all men
are doomed

  but he always held his tongue
galt was right it was better that
	startling stories

they should enjoy this unsuspecting
happiness until the end sometimes
he regretted his own shrewd guess-
that he must be left outside the citadel
to perish with these thousands that he
watched

  but-and it was fortunate he knew
-he had little time for such appalled
reflections each nightly flight to the
moon took nine or ten hours and he
spent two hours every afternoon in
his tiny office busy with the details of
liquidating his fortune and applying
it to the vast demands of the work on
the moon

  his admiration for his companions
grew he often saw mart worth or
drumm for a few minutes on the
moon sometimes one or the other of
them came back with him for a few
days on earth and once pat way-
land went with him to the moon ac-
companied by mysterious crates and
boxes from her laboratory

  the wonders of space were still
novel to the girl lost in the splendor
of far-off stars she seemed to forget
her odd resentment at his own ad-
miration it was no wonder that the
others all loved her

  a few things happened however
that stirred his old mistrust about the
utopia corporation one incident
concerned the men sent back from the
moon

  these were laborers who injured or
ill or merely tired asked to be re-
turned to earth they were brought
back in the big steel barges or some-
times when there were only two or
three aboard the pioneer itself

  and cartwright was appalled once
when he asked a hairy dark-faced
construction foreman how long he had
been at work on the moon the man
hitched up his overalls and shifted
his cud of tobacco and stared

  the moon you plumb crazy mis-
ter i aint never been out of ohio
in my life till you give me this plane
ride

  a few other injuries among the
tired men he was disembarking in the
darkness on the outskirts of youngs-
town revealed that none of them had
any recollection whatever of the
months they had labored on the moon

and any suggestion of the truth filled 
them with a curious anger

  that seemed faintly sinister to cart- i
wright and he mentioned the matter
to galt

  the big tanned man stood up slowly 
behind his desk shaking his unkempt
head it seemed to cartwright that 
his broad fatigue-lined face had an ex- i
pression of deep regret

  you understand jay that secrecy
is essential we have to preserve it i
in the case of these men or of any
of the men involved in our operation i
we use another psychological gadget i
of pats you have seen how she can
put things in your head with the
ideophore well with the tau-ray i
she can take them out just as easily i

heres something about
this cartwright said flatly 
that i dont like

  galt came to him heavily and took
his arm

  perhaps i dont either jay his
tired voice said but it is the only 
way his fingers tightened please
jay-whatever happens dont lose
faith in utopia incorporated

  cartwrights faith was very nearly
shattered however by a newspaper
headline months had gone it was
spring the nights had become too
short to cover the flights of the 
pioneer he had gone to sleeping
aboard on the moon he got the paper i
on one of his midnight trips to man-
hattan

 nebula threatens earth

  he read the black streamer with a
sinking heart it must mean that
months of effort had been in vain the
secret was out now there would be 
panic then reading the story he
stiffened with a puzzled anger

  the end of the world will come by collis-
ion with a stellar nebula according to an an-
nouncement made last night by dr lionel
haught of mt wilson observatory

  this menacing object discovered by dr
haught is a huge spiral cloud of gas and
meteoric debris now located in the direction
of the constellation perseus

  all life dr haught predicts will be swept
from the solar system by th meteoric rains
the fortress of utopia



 of the collision but our generation he as-
 sured reporters doesnt have to worry about
 what will happen when earth meets nebula

   because that event wont take place-it
it does at all-for more than two centuries
dr haughts calculations have placcd the
probable date of collision as the year 
a d

   cartwright stared at a blurred half-
tone it was the same spiral-armed
cloud that worth had showed him
from the observatory on the moon
and a cold aching sickness grew in
his heart

  galt and the others had tricked
him his guess about the reason for
their evasions was obviously wrong
he shook his yellow head bewilder-
edly what was the use in rushing
completion of the citadel on the moon
two hundred years and more ahead of
any possible danger

  what really was the utopia cor-
porations great plan

  now cartwright decided grimly he
was going to find out

chapter vi
the vault of sleep

with the newspaper crumpled
in a quivering hand cart-
wright walked into the office of ly-
man galt hollow-eyed with fatigue

the central peak of arzachel was a hive of
activity chapter v


startling stories

the big director of the utopia cor-
poration looked up from his untidy
desk

  cartwright flung the paper down in
front of him

  well galt his voice was brittle
ive come this time to get the truth
all of it youve put me off long
enough

  galt leaned slowly back in the big
chair lacing brown fingers together
over his stomach his broad brown
face twisted into a pained grimace
his lips set and he said nothing
cartwright leaned over the desk

  i had thought his tense voice
rapped that you were evading the
truth to spare my feelings-because
you had judged me unfit to be saved
but evidently i was mistaken there
have been a good many things i didnt
understand and several that i didnt
like now - if you want my john
henry on any more checks-just what
really is your plan

  for a long time galts hollow red-
rimmed eyes stared fixedly at cart-
wright at last he nodded as if in
decision his fingers unlaced a big
brown hand fumbled unconsciously in
his pocket for pipe and pouch

  ive been wanting to tell you jay
he said when you hear youll un-
derstand my hesitation he gestured
with the pipe-stem sit down jay
cartwright pulled the chair up
close

  haughts conclusions are surpris-
ingly accurate galt touched the
black headline worths own date
for the holocaust is also  that
means we have about two hundred and
thirty years to carry out the plan

  if we have over two hundred
years cartwright demanded why
are you rushing to complete the
citadel in one

  when the holocaust comes galt
said soberly the citadel will be no
use at all the surface of the moon
like that of the earth will probably
be fused to a depth of thousands of
feet men cant live under seas of
molten lava

  he made an ominous little gesture
with the unlit pipe

  no jay his dark head shook

there is nothing at all in the present
state of scientific advancement that
offers any hope whatever of survival
through the holocaust his voife
rang hollowly if the earth passes
through the nebula it will emerge a
sterile planet

but perhaps cartwright put in
hopefully science in two hundred
and thirty years will advance far
enough to do something about it
galts unkempt head shook again

  i dont think so-not without our
plan his big hand opened the news-
papers look here nothing but un-
employment graft strikes war no
jay the tide of civilization is ebbing
again

  there is another dark age ahead-
an age of want and pestilence and war
and ignorance and degraded barbarism
-unless we carry through our plan
well cartwright leaned for-
ward what is the plan

galt laid his pipe on the littered
desk

  if you didnt know pat and worth
and captain drumm-if you hadnt
seen the ideophore and the pioneer
and the beginnings of the citadel-
you would scoff at the plan but i
think you have been prepared

  im expecting something pretty
remarkable cartwright admitted
lets have it

  galt rose with an odd and somehow
ominous little smile

  we have a barge load of equipment
and chemicals ready to go to the
moon he said ill send pat out
with you to demonstrate exactly how
the plan is to work

  some grave undertone in his voice
sent a tremor up and down cart-
wrights spine

  cant you just tell me now
galt beckoned him inexorably to-
ward the door

  pat will be ready in half an hour
cartwright waited impatiently on
the terrace above the lights and the
subdued endless sound of the city
pat wayland appeared at last stum-
bling under a huge carton marked
fragile he helped her with it and
she thanked him with a sweetness that
the fortress of utopia



for once seemed unalloyed with
poison

  now he said about the plan

  dont ask questions she advised
him sweetly ill show you on the
moon

  all right he said but no more
tricks

  the pioneer lifted above the citys
sprawling lights softly drumming
it settled into a roofless abandoned
warehouse in newark to pick up the
loaded barge as it boomed away
toward the moon pat wayland stood
near cartwright looking into space

  splendid isnt it jay her voice
was soft with awe its terrible and
inspiring and beautiful perhaps if
our plan goes through men will live
to look upon it for a million years
perhaps they will even become a real
part of it and not just a few insignifi-
cant vermin clinging to a mote of
dust

  the throb of the geodes abruptly
faltered the little ship lurched at
the edge of a dead pocket so that the
girl was flung against cartwright as
his hands moved with a practiced and
almost unconscious skill to keep them
out of the perilous dead area he was
aware of the warm vibrant contact of
her body her blond fragrant hair
brushed his face

  she laughed softly with a mur-
mured apology

  you know jay this is like one of
those rides at coney island

  he caught her arm steadied her

  pat he whispered youre human
tonight i really believe you have a
heart

  her blue eyes went dark with pain

  i had one she said softly once

  dont you think you could find it
again he saw her sharp little ges-
ture and went on hastily even if
not for me-though you must know i
love you pat i tried not to fall for
you-i knew it would be no dice but
-i do love you

  he saw her face in the pale rays of
the growing moon and it was stony
white

  dont any of us have a chance he
asked her you know that drumm
loves you-and tries to hide it with

his banter dont you know that mart
worth treasures your picture among
his astronomical plates dont you
realize that galt is eating his heart
out for you-and never saying a
word

  do you think i dont know

the little sound she made began
like a sob but it ended with a
little silvery laugh cartwright
shrugged wearily

  all right pat if you want to be
the goddess of science-go ahead

  her smooth face flushed and wrath
smouldered in her eyes

  when you are angry he told her
you look more beautiful than ever

  cliche her voice had its old
infuriating sugar-sweetness per-
haps drumm should give you another
lesson with the ideophore now ive
work to do

  she went back to the folding desk
at the rear of the deck and cartwright
tried to keep his mind on the job of
taking the pioneer safely out to the
moon

  whatever bit pat he told himself
it wasnt the love-bug he stared at
the mottled expanding globe ahead
or maybe it was

  the pioneer dropped toward the
stark high-walled plain of arzachel
thrusting out its black triangle of
shadow the central peak lifted
swiftly

  the citadel during these months of
labor had taken swift form an im-
mense disk of white concrete crowned
the flattened summit a smaljer disk
upon it left a circular terrace the
dome of worths observatory rose
from the center of the upper disk

  cartwright set the white barge upon
the lower terrace stevedores in
bulky white suits swarmed out of
valves in the curving wall to unload it
he dropped the pioneer in its own
cradle locked and sealed the valves
and grinned back at pat

  all right diamond lady he said
im ready to be told about your
plan

  captain drumm and martin worth
were waiting for them in the corridor
within magnificent as ever in a new


startling stories

crimson uniform drumm seized the
girls hand

  welcome darling to our little
love-nest on the moon weve got
your room all decorated it is pink
with a frieze of cupids -

  wouldnt you like it for yourself
pat asked sweetly but-is jays
room ready

  eh it seemed to cartwright that
captain drumm and the little astrono-
mer looked at one another with some-
thing like consternation of course
-but why

  we must show it to him the girl
said limpidly it seems that jay has
been asking some questions about the
plan and lyman agreed to let him
have a demonstration

  oh the voice of captain drumm
sounded queerly hollow of course
cartwright glimpsed the sharpened
v of the little astronomers brows his
expression of satanic amusement
suddenly cartwright shuddered he
couldnt help feeling that something
was very much wrong

  well darling see you afterwards
said captain drumm he added too
hastily both of you of course
grinning sardonically worth lifted
his thin hand in a little parting ges-
ture

 this way said pat wayland
the vaults are the first thing you
must see and they are nine thousand
feet below

wtneasily cartwright followed
mj her into the small cage of an
automatic elevator it dropped free
cartwright clutched a hand rail to
keep from bumping his head on the
ceiling

 see here he demanded again
why cant you just tell me about all
this

  youll understand she promised
him blandly the innocent sweetness
of her smile seemed a little over done
when i tell you that we are going
to live here in the citadel until the
holocaust comes-

  he stared at her

 ourselves live two hundred
years

  her blond head nodded

  we discovered on the first trips
here that the lesser gravitation causes
subtle psychological changes there
is a slowing in the rate of metabolism
not at first pronounced but i have
discovered a gas that increases the
effect a rather complex organic
compound we call it the sleep gas
the elevator stopped tense with
a growing alarm cartwright followed
the girl out into a narrow hall the
walls of it were gray concrete their
massiveness made him feel the weight
of the lunar mountain above

  set close together in the wall were
a row of heavy doors they were
green-painted steel set with bright
chromium knobs and dials they
looked like the doors of bank vaults
each of them cartwright saw was
painted with the name of one of his
associates galt drumm wayland-
he stared in a cold apprehension
at his own name

  the girl stooped spun the dials
cartwright was frightened he
wanted to run back into the elevator
and leave her here but he tried to
put aside the fear after all he ad-
mired galt and worth and drumm 
he had trusted them and he loved
pat wayland

  these doors seal the girl was
saying there are clocks and auto-
matic valves to control the flow of
sleep gas and breathing mixture we
will be able to survive in these vaults
-with intervals outside-until the
year of the holocaust

  cartwright repressed another shud- f
der

  but still-i dont see what this
has got to do with the plan

  smiling innocently the girl opened
the massive door

  ill explain everything as we go 
along now have a look at the room
where you are going to spend the most
of the next two centuries

  cartwright followed her unwill- 
ingly into the narrow gray-walled 
cell alertly keeping between her and
the door he quickly surveyed it-and
shuddered

  it was very much like a prison cell
there was a bunk a chair a little
table on the table were a wash basin
the fortress of utopia



and several sealed bottles of water and
some cans of food at the foot of the
bunk was a ventilation grille in the
wall with a fan behind it

  pat way lands light hand touched
his arm

  cozy eh her voice had a silver
trill everything you need

  his arm stung under her hand he
saw the bright needle in her fingers
and felt a swift-spreading numbness
a frantic desperation moved him to-
ward the door but that racing numb-
ness seized his limbs and he toppled

pat wayland caught him
pushed him across the bunk he
tried to fight to stand but he
couldnt move any more he saw her
dimly standing at his feet smiling
down sweetly the little needle glit-
tered as she waved at him

  a far thin whisper he heard her
voice

  sweet dreams jay

  the strange paralysis that held him
was a wall of pure horror she was
going to leave him here she was
going to put him to sleep with that
gas he was going to be buried alive
under that mountain on the moon

  but why his dead lips strove in
vain to ask that question why hadnt
the utopia corporation played fair
with him

 how long he struggled des-
perately to speak must he lie buried
here for months and years perhaps
even for centuries until the holocaust
had come

  no sound came he couldnt move
and suddenly he saw that the girl
was gone

  dully to his ears there came a hol-
low thunderous clang it was the
great door closing the light above
his head went out he lay in utter
darkness utter silence-in the dead
heart of a dead world

  then there was a faint whispering
he knew it was the gas it had a
queer pungent sweetness somehow
it was soothing relaxing it smoothed
away his terror his drumming pulse
slowed it was a long time before he
needed to breathe again

  he slept

      chapter vii
      the ray of oblivion

i	ii -- - r - i bm

in his drowsiness jay cartwright
felt an odd reluctance to awaken
he wanted to sleep on-on-

  but a fan was whirring it blew
fresh cold air against his face and
someone was beside him calling him
to get up

  the calling voice seemed dimly fa-
miliar he tried to forget it to relax
again into pleasant oblivion but it
insisted and suddenly he knew it
it was the voice of lyman galt

  galt the name set up a clangor of
alarm in him abruptly he remem-
bered the vault under the moon he
recalled how lovely pat wayland had
lured him into it paralyzed him
closed the great door

  panic broke the web of sleep the
aromatic gas he realized was gone
he made a convulsive effort to break
that numbing paralysis and found
that it had left him

  sitting up on the bunk he rubbed at
his sticky eyes his garments had
been changed for a loose white robe
he explored his itching chin and
found a short stubble

  well jay how are you

  he peered about the narrow gray-
walled cell his eyes cleared and he
found lyman galt his face looked
thinner hollowed bleached a little as
if he had been ill

  im all right-i guess i am cart-
wright muttered but i dont like
this galt pat tricked me in here and
put me to sleep this beard-alarm
cracked his voice-how long have i
been here galt

  five months nearly galt told
him that was april and this is
august

  five months cartwright blinked
and stared why did you do this to
me galt his voice was bitter i
trusted pat-trusted you all

  galt shook his dark head regret-
fully

  i was just afraid you wouldnt un-
derstand jay he said this was the


startling stories

simplest way to take care of your ob-
jections besides pat wanted a human
guinea pig for a final test of her sleep
gas-and it seems to have worked
splendidly

  anger shook cartwright

  do you think it was fair to me-
to keep me in the dark trick me re-
member i paid the bills for half your
mysterious plan

  for all of it jay galt told him
you remember there was a power of
attorney we sold the last of your
securities a month ago

  what cartwright swayed up-
right trembling so it was robbery
after all jitst a clever plot- he
bit his quivering lip i put my faith
in you galt i liked you and drumm
and worth-loved pat and you all
conspired to rob me

  wait jay galt caught his arm
dont judge us yet he hesitated
you see we have done something else
-something that will be harder for
you to accept than anything you
know

  and what is that

  fly me to earth in the pioneer
galt told him and you will see

the automatic elevator whisked
them upward to a curving corri-
dor in the upper level of the citadel
a silence complete dead pressed
crushingly upon them cartwright
spoke of it uneasily and galt said
the citadel is finished all our
workmen have been carried back to
earth the working of the plan has
begun

  they came into a wide white-tiled
kitchen small heavy round windows
looked out into the lunar night the
pitted convex floor of arzachel a mile
beneath was gray in the pale earth-
shine vague and mighty the distant
rampart of the crater wall loomed
against the sharp-etched splendor of
the stars

  pat wayland and captain drumm
were sitting at a little table over toast
and coffee the blond girl looked up
at cartwright and her blue eyes
smiled serenely

  hello jay she said sweetly
sleep well

  cartwright gulped angrily for his
voice

watch your step darling drumm
leaned back and laughed at the girl
jay might wake up first sometime
galt had opened the door of a huge
refrigerator

  hungry jay its five months re-
member since you ate even with
damped metabolism you have a right
to an appetite what will it be

  he began breaking eggs into a siz-
zling pan and cartwright forgot his
anger in a sudden awareness of gnaw-
ing hunger looking at a big clock
on the wall pat rose-it was an odd
clock cartwright noticed with extra
hands for months years and cen-
turies

  i must get back to the tau-ray she
said mart offered to watch the pro-
jector while i ate it has been on
eight hours moving just now across
europe and africa well let it run
twenty-five hours just to make sure
pat-

  there was an odd note of urgent ap-
peal in galts deep voice he moved
to follow the girl

  pat-jay and i are going down on
the pioneer for a little inspection tour
i want to show him how the plan is
working

  the same old song her laugh
was a silver mockery wont young
cartwright be surprised

  pat galt said huskily please
suddenly her voice was grave
remember-dont leave the ship
aboard youll be safe enough the
lead-glass filters on the ports will ab-
sorb the tau-ray but dont leave the
ship

  of course there was a little
choked break in galts voice and
pat-pat-

  the girl came back toward him her
blue eyes were wide wondering
what is it lyman

  galt stared at her for a moment his
dark lip trembled suddenly he
gulped a deep breath and made a little
shrugging gesture

  nothing pat nothing im sorry
good-by

  so long chief the round per-
fection of her arm made a careless

little gesture youve just time to
see the ray strike america just re-
member-stay aboard the ship

 devouring scrambled eggs and
bacon buttered toast and jam a huge
bowl of cereal drowned in canned
milk cartwright suddenly observed
that galt had not touched his own
plate his hollow eyes haunted the
door where pat had gone out

ffjood-by cartwright heard
him whisper faintly dear

pat

an abrupt sense of alarm ended
cartwrights appetite

im ready he said lets go

as they passed another small round
port cartwright glimpsed a queer
machine on the curving terrace out-
side thick cables writhed to the end
of a great cylinder that glowed with a
peculiar penetrating violet

that ominous shining tube was
pointed like a telescope-or a weapon
-at the huge brilliant half-risk of the
earth pat wayland hardly recog-
nizable in her heavy white armor was
peering through a guide telescope be-
side it

  the tau-ray projector said galt
what- alarm choked cart-
wrights voice to a whisper what is
it doing to the earth

 we shall see galt told him
solemnly when we arrive

 through the three hours of the


startling stories

earthward flight galt seemed grave
and troubled he strode up and down
the tiny deck sometimes peered ab-
sently out at the star-dusted splendor
of space once sat down at the little
desk and scrawled out a brief note

 the waxing moon slipped down be-
hind the curve of the planet as they
dropped into the upper atmosphere
the dim green vastness of north
america spread westward at last
galt stirred himself to speak

  land in times square jay well
wait there till the moon rises-that
will be almost exactly noon-and
watch it happen

  cartwright fought a little shudder
of numbing unease

 in times square he remem-
bered all the night flights of the
pioneer when he had raced to keep
the little geoflexor under cover of
darkness at noon

 galt shrugged his manner oddly
solemn

  i dont suppose that many people
will notice us at all he said it
doesnt matter if they do-for theyll
soon forget

  his hands trembling a little on the
controls cartwright brought the little
silver ship down toward the long
island of manhattan below the green
rectangle of central park he followed
the long diagonal slash of broadway

 eh he muttered somethings
wrong

 he looked anxiously at galt the
big man peering out with hollow eyes
seemed to see nothing at all but the
streets were jammed traffic was
snarled in knots at every intersection
the sidewalks had overflowed with
frantic pedestrians times square was
a sea of tight-packed humanity

 cartwright brought the pioneer
down gently beside the old times
building the crowd surged away to
make room for it to land then the
pressure of the throng crushed men
and women back against it

  theyre all frightened whispered
cartwright horrified what can
be wrong

  galts hollow eyes stared fixedly
unseeingly out

  wait he said dully its only a

few minutes until the rising of the
moon then you will see

  cartwright started back toward the
entrance valve

  im going out and ask them

ith a sudden frantic move-
ment galt seized his arm

  dont do that he said urgently
you heard pats warning the pio-
neer is armored against the ray
were safe aboard but you must not
leave the ship

  my god-why dont you tell me

  galt shook his haggard head and
cartwright turned to look out again
a newsboy came into his view he
tried to read the screaming headline
on the paper the boy held up but it
whs snatched away the boys whole
bundle was seized torn from hand to
hand a tall man backed against tlje
pioneer to guard his prize cart-
wright leaned anxiously against the
port to read

silence spreads across
atlantic may reach
here at noon

  that mysterious belt of silence which last
night suddenly cut off all communications
with the far east is steadily advancing
westward the last cable from london was
dispatched at seven oclock this morning
noon london time reports from atlantic
shipping have since been ceasing as the belt
moves westward with nearly the speed of
the earths rotation

  science has yet offered no satisfactory ex-
planation of this disturbing phenomenon it
is hoped that the inexplicable failure of com-
munications does not mean loss of life none
of the interrupted messages seems to hold
any clue whatever meteorologists doubt
that the cause could be an electrical storm
for radio and telegraph facilities in the
western hemisphere have not been affected
war department officials refuse to comment
upon conjectures of a new military device

  as the noon hour aproaches america
panic is mounting in metropolitan districts
municipal and washington officials how-
ever are broadcasting reassuring statements
other than the silence  cause of alarm lias
been observed-

 a weeping woman snatched the
paper away peered at it with an ex-
pression of desperate hope she
flung it from her and picked up a
small bewildered child in her arms
she clung to the child and her wet
the fortress of utopia



eyes lifted toward a great clock that
was part of a sign

  a silence had stilled all the uneasy
murmur of the crowd it was a ter-
rible breathless frightened silence
a hundred arms were pointing at the
clock thousands of tense white
faces stared at the hands of it closing
together like the blades of a mighty
pair of shears

  dimly far back in his bewildered
mind cartwright tried to remember
something about another pair of
shears with which somebody had
snipped the life-threads of mortals
when their fated hour had come

  the hands were together

  nothing happened for a long
dragging minute nothing happened
people began to look again at one
another smiling hopefully it was
nothing after all a wave of cheering
rolled down broadway

  the great hands drew apart and it
happened

abruptly as if life had been
mysteriously withdrawn from
them the cheering thousands toppled
they fell like grain that is cut by the
sickle there was no sound there
was nothing in the sky no visible
agency touched them but as far
down the streets as cartwright could
see they toppled into endless heaps
and windrows

  reeling with a cold numbing sick-
ness of horror cartwright put his
hand to his eyes he stumbled away
from the port he stared quivering
at galt who was still looking out un-
seeingly

  so this is what your tau-ray has
done he said hoarsely you have
used it to murder the world

chapter viii
forgetfulness

ut galt shook his head

  they arent dead his trem-
bling fingers touched cartwrights
shoulder and he pointed through a
port see they are living moving

they are only    forgetful

  cartwright pressed his face against
the small round port staring he was
held in a shuddering fascination for
as far as he could see up and down
broadway and seventh avenue and
rd street the fallen multitudes were
moving

  their motion was dreadful to see

  swaying with a sickness of revul-
sion gripping the brass rail with
clammy hands cartwright watched
those nearest him on the pavements of
times square

  they rolled their eyes stared un-
focused blank with an utter stupidity
they made mouthing hideous grim-
aces they kicked out their arms and
legs with aimless sprawling gestures

  sometimes one of them made a
clumsy effort to pull himself upright
but always he lost his balance and
sprawled again across his neighbors

  a terrible silence had fallen as they
toppled they had lain at first in such
a stillness that cartwright had
thought them dead but no sound
came from them again

  it was a mumbling inarticulate
babble here and there a thinner
sound cut above it-the sound of wail-
ing for men and women were scream-
ing like frightened infants

  cartwright looked mutely again to
galt his stomach felt very sick he
tried to fight down the cold nausea of
horror rising in him

  you see galt said they have
forgotten

  stupidly cartwright parroted

  forgotten

  galt nodded again and regret was
solemn in his eyes

  they have forgotten everything
they ever learned they have forgot-
ten how to walk and how to talk
they have forgotten all the strate-
gems and devices that they had
learned in the old world

  a strange elation lit galts face

  all the mental scars that they got
in the jungle of the old world are
healed now they are young again
they are infants only the primary
reflexes with which they were born
survive

  i see cartwright nodded sickly


startling stories

the ray destroyed their minds
not their minds - merely their
memories they can learn again far
more swiftly in fact than they
learned as actual infants because
learning will not have to wait upon
muscular and neural development
and you did it with the ray
with pats tau-ray galt told him
it is a penetrating actinic radiation
whose effective frequencies are care-
fully synchronized to disrupt certain
proteid molecules in the nerve tissue
one product of the break-down
formed in minute quantities is a sub-
vital self-propagating virus

  the ray is quite invisible but a
flash of it against the retinal cones or
even against the nerve-endings in the
skin is enough within a few sec-
onds the virus has pervaded the en-
tire nervous system

  the effect is only a slight tempo-
rary change in the myelin nerve-
sheath slight chemically speaking
but its effect at the synaptic junction
of the fibers is to destroy all learned
associations the memory of the indi-
vidual is blotted out

the interior of the little pioneer
seemed to spin around cartwright
he grasped the handrail and tried to
believe that all this was an insane im-
possible dream but he still saw the
stricken thousands outside wallowing
in a dreadful dumb helplessness upon
the pavements of times square

  you have done this to-every-
body he whispered everywhere
that was necessary galts great
shaggy head nodded solemnly none
must escape save our chosen ones in
the citadel that is vital to the
plan

  an iron determination in his deep
weary voice rang terrible to cart-
wright

  for not one trace of the old
worlds corruption must be left to
poison our new utopia

  cartwright gulped twice before he
could speak

  but this is murder galt his
tight voice quivered dont you see
-everything will stop transporta-
tion manufacture farming dont you

see what will happen

   galts dark face was bleak

  i suspected that you would feel
this way about it jay he said that
is why i kept putting off any revela-
tion of the plan

  well cartwright gripped his
arm now that youve done this
just what is your magnificent plan
you have reduced all the human race
to gibbering helpless idiots he
laughed bitterly what next
gibbering perhaps said galt
helpless but not idiots they are
infants children who may grow up
to build a more splendid world than
the old one could ever have been
cartwright shrugged impatiently
a world of babies-what is to keep
them all from perishing of hunger
before they even learn how to eat
his voice rang hard remember
galt our own civilization has been-
had been a hundred thousand years in
the making and you have wiped it
out

  if the old world had progressed
no farther in a hundred thousand
years galt said softly dont you
think there must have been something
wrong with it

  he straighted until his dark head
almost touched the dome of the
pioneers hull

  listen jay - the reason for our
plan is the coming holocaust men
have just a little more than two cen-
turies before the earth plunges into
the nebula that is the end-sunless
something can be done

  i dont know how the earth can be
saved i dont know how any men can
survive clearly the only hope is in
some splendid spurt of scientific
progress i cant guess what the solu-
tion would be but i believe that a
great enough science could find a way
to save the earth

  the old world as things were go-
ing was obviously doomed to fail it
was economically sick wars were
sapping its strength it had no
morale-and no care for the future
the final discovery of the nebula
meant only another scare-head in the
newspapers that is why we planned
a new beginning
the fortress of utopia



ell said cartwright
ww men dont know enough to
save themselves-so you make them
forget the little they know now
what do they do

  they build utopia

  a solemn strength moved galt
you have seen only the plans first
step the tau-ray leveled the old
ramshackle building now we will
help them build utopia upon a new
foundation

 help them cartwright turned
shuddering from another glance out-
side if we could-but how

 the minds of men are all swept
clean galt said but in our citadel
on the moon we have all the good and
useful things the old world had
learned we shall teach the utopians
what they should know with the ideo-
phore

  the ideophore

  staring cartwright felt a tremor of
hope

  pat has designed a portable unit
galt told him we have made up a
series of records for it on steel rib-
bons that contain the fundamentals
that men must be taught the founda-
tions of utopia

 we must return when the ideo-
phore has done its work we shall
select individuals here and there all
over the earth and educate them with
the ideophore to be the leaders of the
race the guides toward utopia

 when the seeds of utopia have
been planted we shall return to the
citadel on the moon we shall sleep
in the vaults there for a generation
and then we shall come back to see
the progress of our plant

  and so every generation we shall
visit the earth-until the holocaust
comes perhaps to aid the new
science of utopia with some forgotten
fact perhaps to spur men on with
some new reminder of the doom to
come

 so we are to be gods cart-
wright laughed again bitterly
eternal beings dwelling apart in our
scientific fastness on the moon con-
descending to walk now and then
among the poor struggling mortals be-
low

  who will soon galt said be-
come greater and wiser than we ever
were-if the plan succeeds but dont
say that we are gods jay he shook
his head say rather that we are
surgeons

  he nodded deliberately

  surgeons-thats it we have diag-
nosed the sickness of mankind we
saw that death was the prognosis the
thing that we are performing is a dan-
gerous and painful but necessary op-
eration it offers the sole hope of sur-
vival

  he gripped cartwrights arm

  now jay he said anxiously do
you see i hope you understand-be-
cause a great deal depends on you

jay

  cartwright shook his yellow head

  i see what youre trying to do he
said i think you were mad to try
it now there can be no turning back
-but it still looks to me like burning
down the house to kill the rats

  no galt smiled wearily but to
build a temple in its place he took
cartwrights hand in a crushing grip
let me congratulate you jay for
you are to be the master builder
what

  cartwright stared at him puzzled
he saw the redness of galts hollow
eyes the fatigue-etched lines in his
face the weary droop of his great
shoulders

ay galts tired voice rumbled
softly ive worked ten years
to perfect the plan eighteen some-
times twenty hours a day im tired
and - well -  a shadow of pain
crossed his dark face theres a
thing that ive got to forget im go-
ing to step into the background jay
and you are to take my place

  eh

  cartwright was bewildered voice-
less

  i trust you jay galt squeezed
his hand again released it please
forgive all the deceptions to which i
was forced and now-are we ready
to take off for the moon

in half a minute cartwright
stared for a moment something in
galts manner puzzled him i must


startling stories

inspect the geodes

  he lifted the narrow hatch cover
climbed down into the machine-
crammed space beneath the deck he
was stooping over a big power tube
when the clang of the air-lock reached
him with a mute protesting cry of
comprehension he stumbled back
above

 lyman galt was already outside
swaying wearily on the pavement he
looked back up through a port his
hollow face grinned and he began a
little tired gesture of farewell

  but the grin faded from his face
all the bitterness and fatigue and
pain that had dwelt there so long
went with it there was left only a
pleased baby-smile

  for a moment he stood there smil-
ing that smile of vacuous content-
ment then he tottered his legs
buckled he made a clumsy aimless
gesture and sprawled helpless among
the others on the pavement

  jay cartwright checked himself at
the valve if he opened it he too
would fall the plan would fail
galt and all these sprawling millions
would perish miserably the plan
was now the only hope the plan
must go on

  fighting a cold sickness of bewil-
derment and horror and despair he
started the booming geodes and lifted
the pioneer back toward the fortress
on the moon

the law of the four

the great tube of the tau-ray
projector was still glowing with
its painful violet on the terrace of
the white citadel captain drumm
was standing beside it - instantly
recognizable because he had deco-
rated his white pressure-suit with
stripes of gold-and-crimson braid he
waved a bulky arm

 cartwright anchored the pioneer
against the entrance lock opened the
valves and clambered wearily through
into the fortress he found pat way-

  land waiting in the curving corridor

  lyman she called anxiously past
him how is the ray working ly-
man when no answer came she
turned anxiously to cartwright
where is he jay her voice quiv-
ered has anything-

  she bit her full red lip her blue
eyes turned dark the smooth per-
fection of her face went pale she
shook her gleaming platinum head
with an abrupt frantic denial

 he couldnt-

  she confronted cartwright whis-
pering

  speak jay tell me

  dully cartwright shook his yellow
head

  you know pat he said softly
sometimes youre human mostly
youre just an adding machine with
a dash of paint and one of poison but
sometimes you really act like a human
being

  frantically her tense fingers dug
into his arm

 tell me - what has happened to
lyman 

 he loved you pat-you know how
it was his voice was harsh almost
brutal and he got tired of loving
you i know exactly how he felt be-
cause i fell for you myself well he
doesnt love you any more

  his laugh was a sharp bitter sound
  because he has forgotten he said
  a white hand flew up to her throat
  you mean-he-

  she went voiceless and cartwright
nodded grimly

  lyman walked out of the pioneer
into your wonderful tau-ray now he
is like the rest of them he is a wal-
lowing babbling idiot who cannot
stand or speak or feed himself and
he doesnt love you any more

 tears glittered suddenly in her
huge blue eyes

  dont say that jay agony was
keen in her voice dont be cruel-
cruel his voice rasped at her
who has been cruel galt cant tell
you now but i can pat mart worth
can captain drumm can

  she pressed both hands hard against
her quivering white face

  jay you dont understand her

 voice was muffled shaking you dont
 know what has happened to me to
 make me what i am

  i know what you did to galt
 please jay-please a sob i
 liked lyman tremendously as i do
 mart and cap and you but love is
 a book that i have closed forever it
 only hurts me when you speak of it
 so-please

   suddenly gentle cartwright touch-
 ed her shining hair

  im sorry pat he whispered
forgive me

  of course jay and dont think
that im not sorry her pale face
was stiff and bleak with pain but
i just cant help it

cartwright jerked his yellow
    head

  anyhow weve got a job to do-
if we are going to do anything for
lyman and all those millions back on
the earth

  slowly the girl nodded her plat-
 inum head

  yes we must go on she whis-
pered for his sake now come on
in the kitchen ill phone mart and
cap to come and fix them a bite to
eat the ray has only a few hours
more to run

  in the wide white kitchen whose
round windows looked out over the

convex crater floor and the ringing
mountain wall that loomed tremen-
dous in the pale earthshine cart-

wright told the others what had hap-

pened in times square

little worths black brows raised to
make a sharp v his thin pale face
was twisted with a bitterly sardonic

lowed pat wayland mockingly

  yes lyman was tired he said
softly he wanted to forget

  for a moment cartwright thought
that the girl was going to burst into
tears then her platinum head tossed
abruptly the old dazzling smile lit
her round doll-face

  isnt it so her cooing voice was
honey-sweet we all of us have so
much to forget

  then the two men turned to cart-
wright

lyman had told us jay said cap-
tain drumm that if anything hap-
pened to him he wanted you to take
his place as leader of the four

he asked me to he said slowly

i dont know why each one of you
knows ten times more than i do about
how the plan is to work

  i know jay we have a new world
to build to do that we need a man
like galt was-and like you are a
leader with the common touch all
the rest of us are specialists with the
usual bias of experts

  i would probably make a world of
astronomers sitting about and pre-
dicting cosmic cataclysms pat would
make them psychologists busy pick-
ing one anothers repressed egos to
shreds drumm would turn them into
a legion of rainbow-uniformed adven-
turers we need you jay-a man like
you-to lead us all toward the goal
that lyman mapped out

  pat nodded agreement and drumm
took cartwrights hand

 ill do my best cartwright
promised and now shall we load
the pioneer with the equipment we
are going to need and get ready to
tackle our job

another day was breaking over

 new york when the little geoflexor
 dropped back into times square
 again pat wayland and worth and
 drumm were busy about the portable

  ideophore which had four helmets at-
  tached by flexible cables to its com-
  pact case

   well find galt first cartwright
italijithsn- rthastheeducator will
give him wits enough at least to save 
his life

  it would be fitting the girl agreed
softly if we can make him one of
the leaders who will guide mankind
toward the utopia that he planned
the little ship touched the pave-
ment

ftphis is where i left him
ji cartwright was peering anxi-
ously out and a sudden apprehension
choked him but he-hes gone

  he had left the stricken multitude
sprawling helpless as new-born in-
fants but now the most of them had
already learned to move about-some-
how dim figures were crawling and
swaying unsteadily through the gray
dawn

 i thought they couldnt move
whispered cartwright i left him-
lying-

  they will all learn very rapidly
pat wayland said there is no im-
pairment of nerves or muscles all
they need is a re-establishment of the
neural patterns the plan depends
on that

  white-faced she peered out

 he must have wandered away

 we must find him whispered
cartwright help him this is -
horrible

  he stared at the unsteady figures
moving in the increasing light some
of them had already learned to eat in
front of a wrecked refreshment stand
he saw a little snarling group strug-
gling clumsily over raw frankfurters 
and bits of bread

  he saw a man-thing in police blue
snatch a gold watch and bite it and
throw it disgustedly away he
watched a sailor stumble after a red- 
haired girl and catch her and kiss her
clumsily

  the basic reflexes martin worth i
the fortress of utopia



said softly survive

 lyman- pat way land was whis-
pering we must find him

 but cartwright was shaking his
head

  we mustnt take the time he said
reluctantly weve got to work
quickly-if were to keep these people
from dying of starvation and a thou-
sand clumsy accidents no we can
help galt best by simply going ahead
with the plan

  he opened the valves and helped
carry the portable ideophore out upon
the pavement

  just what is on the reels he asked
pat he was trying to keep his mind
off the strange fate of galt what
will the machine teach them

 lyman spent years selecting the
material she told him there is a
modified simplified english an un-
derstanding of all the sciences as
complete as we could make it the
principles of art music morality re-
ligion law-of everything good that
the old world knew

  nor is that all for there is a
danger you see that utopia will be
corrupted by the remains o the old
world that lie all about and there
is another danger that the utopians
will go off on a tangent and forget
their great task of saving the earth
from the holocaust

 to meet those two dangers the
ideophore will impart feeling of re-
spect and obedience for a special law
they will revere us as the four
they will know us as human beings
like themselves-but human beings of
mysterious power and authority who
must be obeyed that will enable us
to keep them to their great task and
to preserve them from contamination
by the things of the old world

  it will be forbidden to enter any
of the buildings of the old world or
to use any of the old machines or read
any of the old books-except of course
that we shall have to make certain
temporary exceptions at first to as-
sure them food and shelter and the
means to make the new beginning

a tall man in the splendid garb
of a hotel doorman escaped the

sprawling babbling mob about the
wrecked lunch stand he came stum-
bling up the street carrying his prize
this proved to be a coconut he tried
it with his teeth and then stopped and
battered it against the curb

  he will do said pat wayland
he is intelligent and strong

  captain drumm raised a shining
little pistol cartwright snatched at
his elbow

  whats this

  drumm displayed the small weapon
paralysis he said it shoots a
tiny steel needle tipped with a chem-
ical of pats effective up to forty
yards it temporarily paralyzes the
motor nerves without destroying con-
sciousness or have any permanent
effect one shot lasts from five min-
utes to half an hour

  oh cartwright looked suddenly
at pat wayland down in the vault
when you put me to sleep was that-
the girl nodded as drumm fired the
tiny gun it made a sharp little ping
and the victim dropped over his coco-
nut they wheeled the portable
ideophore to him propped up his limp
head and fitted a light helmet over it

  pat started the humming converter
adjusted dials

  the paralysis of the motor nerves
she commented prevents the usual
spasmodic reflexes she moved a
lever thirty seconds-thats all
you may remove the helmet

 they stood watching in a few
minutes the man stood up and deftly
straightened his uniform his face
bore a friendly and intelligent smile

  i thank you four he said simply
for selecting me to be a leader of the
utopians i will obey your law and
labor to build utopia so that the men
to come may save earth from the
holocaust now i must help my com-
rades to find food and shelter

  leaving them he picked up the
coconut that had baffled him before
and broke it on the sidewalk and gave
the fragments to a weeping woman
who had not yet learned to stand
ping ping ping ping

  with four swift shots drumms
paralysis gun toppled four men in a
group pushing the wheeled cabinet

the renegade

in a thousand cities and ham-
lets on every inhabited continent
the same procedure was repeated the
pioneer settled amid the clumsy
speechless victims o the tau-ray
captain drumm with the paralysis
gun dropped half a dozen or half a
hundred men and women from the
magic of the ideophore they rose
again to be the leaders of the utop-
ians

  washington and yokohama paris
texas and paris france berlin and
toledo ohio moskva and montevi-
deo honolulu and singapore nome
and petropavlovsk and kansas city-
and ten thousand more

 the weeks and then the months
went by for the earth was large
even though they worked day and
night snatching odd bits of sleep one
by one it took a long time to cover all
the planet and they found unpleas-
ant things

  they found hunger and blood and
death

  in tokio the tau-ray must have left
no memory of the art of quenching
fire-not even of the danger of flame
only black ruin was left when the
pioneer came four helpless millions
perished in that unopposed conflagra-
tion of flimsy tinder-houses nor was
tokio the only city that burned

  in the crowded areas of europe and
asia the food at hand was soon ex-
hausted the speechless rabble ob-
livious of the intricate machine of
commerce that once had fed them
poured out of the cities in a ravening
horde they stripped the countryside
of everything edible starving men
became hunters of men

  once staring at a broad military
road in germany that was scattered
with white tooth-marked bones jay
cartwright felt a cold overwhelming

sickness at all the agony and death the
tau-ray had brought leaning against
one of the pioneers small round ports
he shuddered

  to kill one man was murder he
said faintly and you died for it to
rob one man was a crime and you paid
for it with years of your life we
have murdered perhaps half the popu-
lation of the earth we have robbed
the rest-even of all memory of what
they have lost

  his voice rose raggedly

  then what are we thieves mur-
derers no there is no word in the
language that fits the thing that we
have done

  the steady iron hand of captain
drumm fell upon his shoulder

  its a terrible thing i know
drumm said but life has always
been terrible the old must give way
to the new a thousand must perish
so that one may have life so it has
always been since the first hungry cell
devoured another

  remember our goal is the survival

of the race mankind was following
a road that led straight to doom we
are setting him upon a different path
it may be harder in the beginning
many must fall by the way but in
the end it must lead to life-to a life
more splendid than was ever glimpsed
before the oblivion

  cartwright was staring at the bones
  but so many he said have died

 -oerhaps they have died
m drumm said but the most of
them were never alive they were rot
ends they were only means they
were not individuals they were cogs
in a machine-that was already break-
ing down

  cartwright turned away from the
port and shook his yellow head

  still theres a lot that i dont see
he said why must we drive men out
of their cities why must they lie
under the rain and the frost when
they need tools why must they let
good implements rust when mil-
lions are roving on foot why must the
railroads be abandoned

  because there must be a clean
break with the past drumm told him
the fortress of utopia



men had too many machines in
offices and subways and factories
their lives were geared to the ma-
chines men made machines of them-
selves they had no time to live

  there will be machines in utopia
of course ultimately there will
probably be more and mightier ma-
chines than the old world ever
dreamed of but they will be the serv-
ants of men and not the masters

 again doubtfully cartwright
shook his head

a year had gone since the day
of oblivion when the pioneer
dropped toward a new village upon a
low hill in what had been new jersey
it had been a year ago only a cluster
of leaf-thatched huts but a kiln was
now smoking beside it and a new cir-
cular building of brick and stone was
rising in its broad central square
fields below were green with a late
corn and turnips and beans

  as cartwright dropped the little
geoflexor toward the dusty street he
looked across toward the lonely tow-
ers of the abandoned metropolis
thirty miles eastward bitterly he
iaughed

  and we made men give up that-
for this

  but asked captain drumm as
they emerged do they seem to
mind

  three children were shouting and
laughing as they drove a herd of
spotted cows out to pasture on the
hillside an anvil rang cheerfully in a
smithy saws and hammers made a
pleasant sound from the building
song rose from a man plowing with
two horses in the field below

  a little group of men came with a
manner of friendly respect to greet
the four their leader-who still
wore the tattered splendor of a hotel
doormans uniform-eagerly told of
the progress that the town had made

  the harvest will give us food for
all and we are hauling wood for the
winter that is our new community
building it will house a laboratory
and a school next year we plan to
open a pottery a mill and a small
chemical works

  splendid said captain drumm
good said cartwright and if
you have need of more fuel and iron
remember that all railroad tracks
lying outside of cities are exempt
from the law his eyes surveyed the
busy village again as he asked are
your people happy

  the leader smiled and nodded
we are happy he assured them
why should anyone be otherwise in
utopia we have made a place for
everyone each has his own tasks to
do and his sure rewards there were
hard times at first but now there is
food and shelter for all but there is
one thing-

the voice of the leader grew
troubled he paused and made a
little unhappy gesture eastward the
towers of the old city were lost in the
misty distance but cartwright saw
a blackened patch on another little
hill and he saw three bodies swing-
ing from a rude gibbet nearer

 whats that cartwright de-
manded has the law been broken
the law has been broken the
leader told him grimly those three
hanging are renegades they were
captured in a fight after their band
had taken and burned the village on
that hill we hanged them as the
law requires but the most of the
band escaped

  cartwright stared soberly at the
distant gibbet renegades all over
earth there were renegades they
were men who had escaped the ideo-
phor and defied the leadership of
those the ideophore had taught

 savages some bands were yet
speechless though the most of them
had learned a few words from the
utopians who had tried in vain to lead
them a few individuals among them
must have had some dim memory of
the old times for they displayed a
surprising aptitude for learning to use
the forbidden machines and weapons
in the forbidden cities they haunted

  the band dwells in the old city
where the law forbids us to follow
them the leader was saying but
they have a daring chief who is called
silver skull he often leads them out


startling stories

in raids across our peaceful lands

  with the other nearby villages of
utopia we keep watchmen upon the
hills toward the river when we have
warning of a raid we arm ourselves
as best we can and fight to save our
homes but silver skull is very cun-
ning he took our neighbor village
in the night by surprise

  cartwright turned to his compan-
ions with a troubled frown

  i was afraid something of the sort
would happen captain drumm said
soberly i knew the job was pretty
big for us really we needed a thou-
sand pioneers and a thousand ideo-
phores to sow the seed of utopia be-
fore these weeds of a new barbarism
had fouled the soil

  theres danger now that these
renegades will contaminate all utopia
with their defiance of the law cer-
tainly we cant expect the utopians
to make much progress toward their
big job of saving the earth with a lot
of savages preying on them

  well cartwright jerked his yel-
low head grimly well give the
utopians some better weapons so they
can defend themselves

  lyman foresaw the possibility of
something like this pat wayland
told them he provided for it in the
plan we have a special ideophore
reel that will teach the utopians how
to make swords and guns with a sug-
gestion that they build electrified
fences around the ruins of the old
cities

  good cartwright said decisively
well initiate some of our utopians
into the mysteries of weapons-
hoping they never get started using
them on one another

 the law pat told him takes
care of that

  the portable ideophore was set up
beside the silver egg of the pioneer
when a ragged blood-stained man
came staggering up the hill he
stumbled gasping to the leader of the
village who was still somewhat dazed
from fifteen seconds of ideophore in-
struction on the defense of utopia

ilver skull he panted
it was silver skull-he came

in the dark i know it was silver
skull his head was white in the
moonlight he stabbed me

  where is he demanded the tall
leader

  he has gone back with his men into
the forbidden city now he carried
red-hair away and left my friend
slim lying dead in the burning camp
where was this asked cart-
wright and what happened

  the panting man stared at him with
dull bewildered eyes he was hug-
ging one arm and the sleeve was
sodden with blood

  at our camp he said we were
burning lime with ties from the rail-
road we were far from the forbidden
cities and we thought there was no
danger last night after the kiln was
fired we slept

  we were fools for it was silver
skull who woke us he killed slim
and took red-hair who was going to
be slims wife he was sobbing
gripping the red arm slim was my
friend

 come the leader beckoned to
him well care for your wound
soon our fear of silver skull will be
ended for the four have taught me
to make weapons and fences that the
renegades cannot cross

  but still whispered the wounded
man my friend slim is dead and
silver skull has taken his girl

  jay cartwright turned impatiently
i think we had better do something
about this fellow silver skull right
now he said without waiting for
guns to be manufactured or he may
be turning out with guns of his own
out of some police armory

 drumms blue eyes were shining
eagerly

  i was just about to suggest it jay
he turned to the tall leader get
your men together and show us the
trail of the silker skull well bring
him back to hang for his defiance of
the law

  the leader gave quiet orders soon
a hundred men were gathered a dozen
of them mounted they were armed
only with their simple tools axes
hoes pitch-forks saws a id sledges
the pioneer floated above them north
he stared in wonderment at that ilrangely altered planet chapter xx j




startling stories

to the burned camp where the mur-
dered lime-burner lay dead then east
toward the abandoned cities along the
hudson

  the men cartwright noticed kept
to the open roads and the fields avoid-
ing the ever more frequent buildings
at last at the weed-grown outskirts
of what had been union city they
stopped when the pioneer was
landed beside them they refused to go
any farther

  it is the law their leader said
we cannot enter the old cities
well make a special exception
cartwright told him until silver
skull is caught

  but it was not that simple he had
not realized the lasting power of the
ideophores suggestions the law
was the law it had to be obeyed not
one man was willing to break it even
at the command of the four them-
selves

  the leader was respectful but firm
the four were the mysteriously
gifted ruler-scientists of utopia it
was the law that in most matters they
should be obeyed but the law said
absolutely that the old cities must not
be entered

  captain drumm abruptly shrugged
the gold-and-crimson splendor of his
shoulders and turned away from the
frightened hundred

      et em wait he said and
mjt well go after silver skull by
ourselves

  we had better not try it cart-
wright said reluctantly the pio-
neer isnt armed weve no weapons
but the paralysis guns and if theyre
hidden in some building we could
hardly find them from the air

  ill ride a horse drumm said
and follow the trail you can scout
for me with the pioneer the paraly-
sis gun will take care of mr silver
skull until the utopians are ready to
hang him

  he borrowed a harness-scarred geld-
ing that once had carried a new york
traffic officer and which had quickly
re-learned what it had forgotten-for
animals too had been subject to the
action of the tau-ray with two bright

little guns belted over the crimson
coat he swung briskly into the saddle
and rode into the deserted streets of
the forbidden city

  the hooves rang musically on the
pavement echoing against a strange
depressing silence the buildings
already looked gray and neglected
tufts of grass had pushed through
cracks in the sidewalks broken win-
dows leered a naked white skeleton
here on the pavement there on a door-
step told its own mute story of the
oblivion

  cartwright guided the pioneer a
hundred feet above alertly at the
ports pat wayland and mart worth
watched for any sign of the rene-
gades

  the trail is leading toward the
lincoln tunnel worth commented
probably our big chief silver skull
has got his headquarters somewhere
in the old subways under manhattan
well never find him there

  but there might be an ambush
the wide blue eyes of pat wayland
rested on drumms erect red-clad
figure you shouldnt have let him
ride in here jay she protested its
splendid of him-the sort of dashing
thing he loves but he might be
killed

  i know cartwright said soberly
but i think we had better get this
silver skull-ive got a hunch that
hes the plans greatest enemy

  he looked suddenly away from the
strained anxiety on her lovely face
suddenly he was wistfully envious of
the courage and dash of captain
drumm probably none of the three
would ever win pats favor but if
any did it would be drumm well
cartwright insisted to himself
drumm deserved her there was
never a braver man

  oh-there

  pat cried out the warning pointing
cartwright saw the little swarm of
ragged grimy men with a slinking
feral quickness they darted out of
weed-tangled alleys and broken win-
dows they rushed upon the lone
horseman

  jay- pat was trembling voice-
less cant you do something
the fortress of utopia



  but already cartwright was drop-
ping the pioneer into the street to
warn drumm and possibly to discon-
cert his attackers but the scream-
ing renegades leaping to surround the
horseman paid the ship no heed

  they were a fantastic lot gaudy
with silks and jewels from looted
shops their weapons cartwright
thought must have come from some
museum for they carried swords and
pikes and spears and medieval battle-
axes

 look gasped pat wayland
silver skull

her quivering hand pointed to a
dark gigantic man who clutched
the wrist of a frightened red-haired
girl all in green silk and fur he was
as splendid as captain drumm on
his head hammered into a crude hel-
met he wore an aluminum kettle-
whence cartwright thought his name
his weapon was a long iron-tipped
african assagai

  mouthing weird incomprehensible
cries the renegades converged upon
captain drumm the frightened
horse reared and snorted but drumm
held his seat without apparent effort
and a bright paralysis gun moved
swiftly in his hand

  ping ping ping

  the foremost renegades began to
stiffen and drop

  dragging the girl silver skull
rushed forward thrust with all his
weight the assagai ripped into the
belly of the rearing horse it fell
screaming backward and drumm went
out of sight

  oh whispered pat hes-un-
der-

  her white hand caught at her throat

  desperately cartwright flung open
the valves he was cold trembling-
he wished that he had drumms easy
courage but with drumm pinned un-
der the horse it was up to him he
snatched a little paralysis gun out of
its rack and leaped out of the pioneer

  but he tripped over one of the fal-
len renegades stumbling back to his
feet he saw the fantastic figure of
silver skull toppling beside him and
cautain drumm rose grinning and

unharmed behind the bulwark of the
horse

  well jay he said cheerfully
weve got silver skull

  he turned to steady the paralysis
gun on a bent elbow and drop the last
of the renegades fleeing down the
alley the red-haired girl was on her
knees weeping beside the fallen
chieftain cartwright walked to her
side looked down at the tanned fea-
tures beneath the batted aluminum
helmet

  a cold hand clutched his heart

  whats the matter jay captain
drumm came anxiously toward him
you look as if you had seen a ghost

  i have he pointed at the man on
the ground silver skull is lyman
galt

chapter xi
the first generation

martin worth helped pat
wayland down from the ship
they came to where the red-haired
utopian girl was weeping over the
stiff form of the paralyzed chief pat
started back from her first glimpse of
him and her face went white all the
vs of little worths face were sharp-
ened by his sardonic smile

  we came to get silver skull he
said softly so that the utopians can
hang him he laughed faintly
now weve got him

  pat wayland was clutching at her
white throat

 but-its lyman her voice was
husky we couldnt take lyman back
to be hanged

  little martin worth was staring at
the fallen man and all the sardonic
mockery was gone from his face

  if i ever had a friend he whis-
pered it was lyman

 stern little furrows etched the
bronzed face of captain drumm as he
snapped a fresh clip of tiny cartridges
into the paralysis gun

  he was my friend too he said
softly but-does that mi-ke any dif-
ference


startling stories

  slowly cartwright shook his yel-
low head

  it makes no difference he said
because silver skull isnt lyman
galt lyman galt was a sum of mem-
ories experiences and all those were
blotted out by the tau-ray silver
skull is a new individual in the same
body he is a renegade he has
broken galts own law that law
says he must be hanged

  drumms red head nodded slightly

  thats true he said

  but pat wayland made a sharp lit-
tle cry of protest

  but we cant-

 we must said martin worth
lyman gave his life to the plan and
it meant more than life to him now
i think that silver skull is the great-
est single danger to the plan i dont
think that there is any doubt about
what lyman himself would want us
to do

  cartwright was staring at the man
on the ground the tangled black
beard and the aluminum kettle and the
gaudy silks seemed to melt away and
he saw all the fatigue and the pain
and the desperate hope that the tau-
ray had swept from the face of lyman
galt

  marts right he said galts real
life was the utopia that he planned-
the hope that that utopia will be able
to escape the holocaust this rene-
gade is a threat to utopia to the very
survival of men through the nebula
i dont think we have any choice

  his yellow head made a sharp little
jerk he looked away from the stiff
fantastic figure on the ground down
to the weed-tangled street

  we-well vote

  ignoring the catch in his voice he
fumbled in his pocket for a handful
of beans he held them out in his left
hand and cupped his right they had
used this method of decision before

  a black one is a vote for the death
of silver skull he said huskily
three votes carry

  he looked aside as one by one the
others came forward selected a bean
from his left hand and dropped it into
his right over his own vote he
paused half a minute despite him-

self he looked back at silver skull
and the barbaric trappings seemed to
fade again so that he saw only the
tired gravely gentle man he had
known

  after all there could be one white
bean

they all gathered around him and
he opened his hand pat way-
land made a little breathless cry
drum caught his breath worth
smiled sardonicaly for there were
four white beans

 four whispered pat then he
lives

 but cartwright and drumm and
worth were looking soberly at one
another cartwright shook his head

  i thought- he muttered jerkily
-i guess we all thought-i think
well have to vote again

  pat waylands tense fingers grip-
ped his arm

 you mean you are going to take
him back to be hanged-after we have
all voted to set him free

 he nodded worth did and
drumm

  dont you see pat he said hus-
kily if we leave him the risk to the
plan is too great

  the girls blue eyes searched their
tense faces suddenly she lifted her
platinum head

  we dont have to hang him she
cried theres a better way we can
use the ideophore on him

  cartwright shook his head doubt-
fully

  i dont know he said if we had
found him right after the oblivionthe
ideophore would have made him a
leader of utopia but now his hard-
ships and his struggle to survive have
given him an independent aggressive
personality im afraid the ideophore
wouldnt change that i can still
teach him facts but i dont think
it will make a good utopian out of
him you know we have found a
rising curve of failures ever since
the first few weeks now if we could
use the tauray on him again-

  the tau-ray works just once pat
wayland said an immunity is de-
veloped to the virus her face was
the fortress of utopia



pale and taut but lets try the ideo-
phore her blue eyes went appeal-
ingly from face to face i believe it
will work lets vote again

  if you think it will work-

  they balloted again and again there
were four white beans

  it is the ideophore said cart-
wright slowly and i hope it makes
a different man of silver skull i
hope it gives us back    lyman galt
the utopian girl watched them
tearfully as they brought the portable
ideophore and fitted one of its helmets
to the renegades head in place of the
aluminum kettle when the thing was
done cartwright offered to take her
back to the town

  kneeling over the prostrate man
she shook her head

  i shall stay with silver skull she
told him he made me break the law
he made me touch the forbidden
things and enter the forbidden places
now i am an outcast and i shall stay
with him

  she clung to his brown hand

  he is not like any man i knew in
the town he speaks little he knows
nothing of science and utopia and the
law of the four and the holocaust to
come but he has a strength a fire

i shall stay with him

  pat wayland moved suddenly for-
ward and touched the girls red head

she slipped a thin jeweled watch from
her arm and put it on the girls slen-
der wrist tears gleamed in her eyes

  take this she whispered he
gave it to me many years ago but he
doesnt remember

  thank you she whispered the
four are very good

wwhen silver skull wakes
w w cartwright warned her tell
him to cease molesting the utopians
tell him that we are giving them new
weapons that can destroy him tell
him to heed the law that we have
taught him as he slept tell him that
if we must come again we shall kill
him

  the girls tearful face burst into a
smile

  then you havent harmed him you
are going to let him live cart-
wright nodded then the four are
very kind

  perhaps murmured cartwright
too kind

  they carried the ideophore back
aboard the geoflexor looking back
from the drumming pioneer as it
lifted with them they saw silver
skull stir and rise he made the girl
fit the aluminum helmet back upon his
head then pushing her behind him
he caught up the bloody assagai and

startling stories

shook it angrily at the departing ship

  still pat wayland insisted i
believe the ideophore will change
him

well come back before we leave
the earth cartwright said and see

  for another year they toured the
communities of utopia it was impos-
sible pat wayland at last agreed for
the ideophore to make any more rene-
gades into good utopians all the
towns that had suffered from the un-
regenerate bands were supplied with
instructions for defense

  many thousands received ideophore
training in science and technology
and the various arts and hundreds of
the most promising scientists received
a special reel devoted to astronomy
and all that was known of the advanc-
ing nebula

  the whole object of the plan
cartwright said is to enable men to
advance far enough to save the earth
from the holocaust we must never
let the utopians forget their great
task

  the pioneer came back at last to
that town in new jersey cartwright
was amazed at the progress of a single
year straw-thatched huts had given
way to neat tiled cottages and pleasant
community buildings a hundred
new industries were busy and the
happy-seeming people had replaced
their tattered old world garments
with gay synthetic fabrics

  geoflexor fliers similar in design to
the pioneer although their copper
cathode power tubes were not power-
ful enough for interplanetary flight
already carried commerce between the
utopian towns

  a world-wide congress of men had
been organized to coordinate all effort
toward the great problem of the com-
ing holocaust plans were already
drawn for a super-observatory to be
erected upon a western mountain

  anxiously cartwright inquired
about the renegades

  there were a few more raids the
leader of the town told him but we
turned back the last of them with the
new machine guns and now we have
finished a charged wire barrier and a
wall of towers surrounding the for-

bidden city i think there will be no
more trouble

  silver skull asked cartwright
their leader-do you know anything
of him

  the utopian shook his head

  silver skull has not been seen
since the four pursued him into the
city we believe that he was afraid
to defy the law again anyhow with
our new defenses utopia is safe

the pioneer flew westward to the
new metropolis of star city the
new observatory was to be erected
above it and the congress of man
was already in session there the rep-
resentatives of utopia greeted the
four with a warm respect

  forgetting his old diffidence in the
urgency of what he had to say cart-
wright spoke before the congress he
reminded them of the approaching
nebula and the great task of saving
earth and mankind

  i dont know how it can be done
he said for it is a bigger thing than
men have ever tried to do the
science of the four enables us to do
many things but it suggests no an-
swer to this great problem

  we four will aid you in every way
we can we shall return from our
own place at intervals of thirty years
to see what progress you have made
but we can do little more than ob-
serve your efforts and suggest lines
of effort and keep the new generations
reminded of the task

  for the problem is one that no
small group will be able to solve nor
any single generation two hundred
and twenty-eight years are left before
the holocaust every day of it will
probably be needed

  now the job is up to you well
come back in nineteen seventy-two
i should say the year thirty-two of
the oblivion-to see what you have
done

  applause thundered in the hall pat
wayland and mart worth and cap-
tain drumm were called to the plat-
form the utopians made confident
promises of progress and then the
four went back aboard the pioneer

  star city dropped behind the con-
the fortress of utopia



vexity of western america contracted
into the earths misty globe the
rugged moon grew large against the
stars ahead and the little ship
dropped toward the white fortress on
the peak of arzachel

  a photo-cell opened a massive valve
in its wall and cartwright maneuv-
ered the pioneer into a compartment
buried behind many yards of rock and
armor

  to protect the ship against meteo-
rites captain drumm explained to
pat here with no atmospheric bar-
rier ws have to expect a good many of
them in two hundred years or even
thirty theres a fair chance that one
would smash the pioneer

  what about us queried the girl
inside

  that depends it was worth who
answered grinning sardonically a
few tons of steel going thirty or forty
miles a second could give the fortress
quite a jolt if you care for an esti-
mate of the statistical probability-
never mind pat said hastily

 the elevator dropped them nine
thousand feet into the narrow gray-
walled corridor before the vaults of
sleep the girl hurried from cell to
cell setting the elaborate clockwork
mechanism within the armored doors
at last she came back to the others
nervous and pale

  they are set for thirty years she
whispered for 

  for a strained little moment they
all crowded close together cart-
wright didnt want to leave the others
there was something terrible about
the very thought of going to sleep for
thirty years

so many things could happen sup-
pose a great meteor did strike
even if it didnt kill them as they
slept it might cave in the elevator
shaft and leave them buried alive
suppose the clockwork failed if
some tiny part went wrong they
might never wake again even if the
clockwork operated perfectly there
still was danger the effects of the
sleep gas had never been tested over
a period so long

  anything might happen

  night darling

  captain drumm spoke cheerfully to
pal and strode into the vault that bore
his name the girl gave him a white
uncertain smile worth turned si-
lently away with a little awkward
gesture cartwright walked into his
own narrow cell

  he closed the massive door and sat
down on the bunk the gray walls
seemed very close about him he could
almost feel the weight of the thou-
sands of feet of rock above suddenly
he was breathless cold with sweat

  he pulled off his clothing drew on
the light robe and reached at last for
the stud on the wall that would start
the mechanism but his hand fell
away he sat as it were shuddering
on the brink of an abyss of three
decades

  beyond the faint racing tick of the
clockwork there was no other sound
the silence was overwhelming the
burden of a world where motion had
ceased thirty years meant nothing
here no more than thirty seconds or
thirty millennia for the moon was
dead

  thirty years he wondered rest-
lessly-what would they mean to the
earth would the utopians carry on
from the beginning they had made
what marvels of science might three
decades disclose

  a dread obsessed him suppose
something turned the utopians away
from their great task recklessness
of futurity or despair then thirty
years would be just one tremendous
leap toward the holocaust toward the
final end

  he wished suddenly that he knew
what the ideophore had done to ly-
man galt

  the silence clotted about him he
moved clapped his hands together
made a dry-lipped effort to whistle
but the stillness grew it came in
little waves that drowned the ticking
of the clock for it was death it was
the enemy of motion and life-

  aw nuts

  cartwright jerked the words out
with a sudden effort he touched the
stud on the wall the light went out
he heard a hissing the fragrant


startling stories

pungence of the sleep gas was strong
in his nostrils he had just time to
settle into a comfortable position on
the bunk

  he slept

  on earth a generation passed

       chapter xii
the gray chieftain
u m	-  r-

a draught of cold air waked
jay cartwright his body felt
oddly numb and stiff but he sat up on
the edge of the bunk he blinked his
sticky eyes and stared bewilderedly
about the small gray cell and at last
saw the clock on the door

  it was august   the thirty
years were ended

  he stood up painfully opened a
sealed water-jar rinsed his dry bit-
ter-tasting mouth splashed water
over his stiff dry skin gulped
thirstily

  movement restored elasticity put-
ting on his clothing he became con-
scious of a ravening hunger he felt
weak with famine as he pushed to
open the massive door

  he was the first in the narrow gray
hall he waited wondering what
thirty years had done to utopia and
what it had done to them would they
be changed aged

  there was no mirror in the hall
but cartwright thought that he had
an old mans stiffness he looked at
his hands-they seemed thinner yel-
lowed he fingered the beard on his
face

  at last little worth came out his
black beard grew down to a point
making him appear more satanic than
ever but to cartwrights relief he
was not visibly older

  sleep well worth grinned sar-
donically half a dozen more such
naps and the earth will be plunging
into the nebula-unless our uptopian
friends have found something to do
about it

  he burst suddenly into laughter at
sight of the thick red expanse of cap-
tain drumms beard pat wayland

her blond beauty unchanged came out
of her own vault and stared at the
men

  evidently she observed the
hair-roots remain disproportionately
active i hope your razors havent
rusted

  the elevator whisked them to the
living compartments above it was
the lunar mid-morning the harsh
desert floor of arzachel remained as
ever changeless northward above
the dark peaks of the barrier ring
hung the earth

  thirty years pat was whisper-
ing faintly as they all stared at the
mother planet it was huge and
bright against the starry void mottled
with cloud msyterious i cant wait
to see what has happened

  perhaps the seed we planted will
already have grown beyond our
knowledge perhaps the utopians
have already found a way of escape
more likely worth said they
have forgotten about the nebula and
gone to building empires

  if they have cartwright said
well remind them again

  the shaft of earthshine through
the port struck pat waylands face
it softened her smooth features and
her blond hair shone her eyes were
dark and grave

  i wonder she whispered what
has happened to lyman

  we all do i guess cartwright
said perhaps well find out on
earth but first we eat

  and shave said captain drumm
five hours later the pioneer
dropped toward star city on the pa-
cific coast three decades had made
it a splendid metropolis the graceful
pylons of its buildings wide-scattered
across verdant parklands

  the parks were crowded today for
the utopians had planned a festival to
honor the return of the four an es-
cort of gay-painted geoflexor ships
guided the pioneer to the entrance of
the splendid new white glass hall of
the congress of man where the com-
mittee of welcome was waiting

an aging white-haired man came
smiling to take their hands
the fortress of utopia



  welcome four his cracked voice
said perhaps you dont remember
me i am the first man you taught
after the oblivion i am the leader of
eden tower in the east remem-
ber

 cartwright remembered the tall
man who had worn a hotel doormans
uniform he nodded listening

  we have made a great festival in
your honor for we remember that
you came to our aid after the ob-
livion and taught us how to build
utopia we have planned displays
to show you the greatness and the
splendor that we owe to you

  martin worths eyebrows flickered
sardonically

  what about the holocaust cart-
wright demanded what progress
have you made toward saving earth
from collision with the nebula
there is our observatory

  the aged utopian beckoned at the
dark arid mountains beyond the city
like a white jewel shining on a peak
they glimpsed the dome of it

  the scientists are working there
he said and now the congress of
man is waiting to receive you there
will be speeches by the greatest of
the leaders and our foremost scien-
tists

  just what definitely cartwright
asked have they accomplished
they are following a hundred lines
of research said the utopian none
of them is yet complete-but we have
two hundred years before the holo-
caust

 which cartwright said is a
pretty short time against the job you
have to do

 wait the utopian urged him
until you see all that we have done
-our splendid cities our new ma-
chines our painting and sculpture
our athletes-all of utopia

  ours is a cooperative world we
have made a place for every individ-
ual there is no hunger or want or
idleness competition is eliminated
there is no strife or disorder because
all of us hold the same ideals every
need of every individual is provided
for we are each a part of the one
great plan now the speakers are

waiting will you receive welcome
wait cartwright said one
more question what about the rene-
gades

  they trouble us no more the
old utopian shook his head they
have been almost exterminated we
still keep guards posted in the towers
of the barrier but they seldom even
glimpse any of the few renegades that
remain

  silver skull-did you ever learn
any more of him

  nothing said the utopian he
was never seen after you pursued him
back into the forbidden places the
congress is waiting

  at last the speeches were done the
tour of cities and factories and labo-
ratories ended cartwright made his
final promise that the four would re-
turn again in the year  of the ob-
livion and every thirty years until the
holocaust for a last time he urged
the tremendous importance of finding
a way to escape the nebula and the
pioneer rose again from star city

  looking back at the far-spread
splendor of the utopian metropolis
cartwright doubtfully shook his yel-
low head

ffl fm not quite happy about it ali
-m he said it seems to me there
is too much ceremony and too many
games and too much respect for the
law-and not enough real hard work
on the problem

  after all said captain drumm
they still have two hundred years
thats just the trouble cart-
wright said men never have wor-
ried very much about what was going
to happen to their great-great-grand-
children not even the ideophore can
make them do that

  anyhow drumm said the dan-
ger will become more real to them as
time goes on with the fine begin-
ning they have already made they
cant help going ahead

  well see said cartwright in the
year two thousand and two

  pat wayland had been staring si-
lently back at the earth her plati-
num head turned abruptly and her
blue eyes were grave


startling stories

  in two thousand two she whis-
pered i was thinking of lyman by
then hell be dead if he isnt already
i was just wondering what the ideo-
phore did to him if-

  her troubled eyes looked at cart-
wright and drumm and worth

 can we land in new york she
asked we might find what became
of silver skull

  id like to know cartwright said
theres danger worth reminded
them the renegades werent too
friendly to begin with and thirty
years of imprisonment in the barrier
fences cant have made them any
kinder

  we beat them once declared cap-
tain drumm -we can do it again
they turned the pioneer toward
what had been new york the sun
sank behind them as they approached
the ruins thirty years they saw had
made a change beyond the white
towers that studded the barrier and
the green well-ordered countrysides
of utopia the old metropolis made a
dark rust-stained blot

  cartwright brought the ship down
in times square to the very spot from
which he had watched the oblivion
come time-stained buildings tow-
ered lonely about them hail-shattered
windows staring blankly

 weeds had conquered the pave-
ments abandoned taxis made little
mounds of debris beside the curbs a
few white human bones here and
there still spoke their mute tales of
the oblivion

  i wonder- cartwright shook his
head its queer theres no sign at all
of the renegades

  he moved the pioneer up and down
broadway dropping to the pavement
at a dozen different spots but there
were only weeds and rust and tum-
bling buildings and those time-
bleached bones

  its no use said martin worth
the utopian guards have probably
exterminated them

  cartwright nodded

i think we may as well give it up
he had lifted the pioneer again
when pat wayland caught at his arm
look-theres someone in central

park a girl i think it looks as if
shes picking flowers

cartwright brought the little
ship down again the girl stood
watching as it landed near her she
wore a simple brief little dress of flow-
ered print-that cartwright knew
must have been manufactured before
the oblivion she was tall and dark-
haired and her arms and legs were
tanned holding the bunch of wild
flowers against her breast she
watched them unafraid

 pretty murmured captain
drumm

  lets go out and talk to her pats
blue eyes were shining eagerly
probably she can tell us what became
of silver skull

  better go armed worth thrust
paralysis guns at cartwright and
drumm she might not be the sim-
ple angel that she looks

  cartwright opened the valve and
led the way down to the thick-matted
grass the girl began to retreat from
them toward the old subway entrance
at columbus circle

  hello pat wayland called to her
we wont hurt you

 go away the watchful girl
shouted back i dont like out-
siders

  we just want to talk to you re-
turned pat where are your peo-
ple

  i have no people said the girl
my people are all dead

  did you know silver skull pa
waylands face was white we were
friends of silver skull

  come if you were friends of silver
skull the girl called back i show
you the grave where he is buried
she let them approach within a few
yards of her and then led the way
again toward the old subway tall and
strong and tanned moving with an
alert quick grace she was almost
beautiful but some hint of re-
strained hostility made cartwright
apprehensive he gripped the little
paralysis gun

  you need have no fear she called
sofly for i am all alone this is the
grave of my father
the fortress of utopia



  she bent over a tangled clump of
weeds-and then suddenly rose and
swung to face them with a well-oiled
sub-machine gun cradled in her brown
arms her clear voice pealed out tri-
umphantly 

  father sam harry

  a little band of silent grim-faced
men rose magically out of the weeds
they were bristling with knives and
guns and came forward with a wary
alertness

  captain drumms hand moved with
the paralysis gun and the tanned
girl swung her heavy weapon to cover
him her brown face held a mocking
smile

  dont move she warned so you
thought my father was dead

  with a soft little cry pat wayland
stared

  cartwright saw the tall gray-
bearded man striding from the old
subway entrance despite the wrin-
kles above the beard and the stoop of
years upon the great shoulders cart-
wright knew him

  it was silver skull who had been
lyman galt

    -i  

      chapter xiii

the meteor

galt staring at the gnarled
stooped old man cartwright felt
a prickle along his spine it was un-
canny for it seemed only a few days
ago instead of thirty years that ly-
man galt had been a young and vig-
orous man burning with enthusiasm
for his great plan

  using his iron-tipped spear for a
cane old silver skull came up to them
he beckoned and two lean men with
leveled rifles stepped alertly up beside
the tanned girl cartwright wondered
at something familiar in their dark-
haired strength and then knew that
they were the sons of silver skull

  little mart worth grinned sardon-
ically at pat

  so the ideophore changed him
he whispered it taught him how to
set neat little traps

  the man who had been lyman galt
spoke in a thin cracked voice that was
still queerly familiar

  you outsiders come into manhat
you kill us when we go out you
fence us in you shoot us from your
towers now you come into manhat
we kill you his seamed face grin-
ned at them amiably is that not
right

  he beckoned to the girl and she
moved to his side with the machine
gun the paralysis gun flashed in the
hand of captain drumm but one of
the rifles cracked and the little wea-
pon went spinning away drumm
nursed his fingers

  dont do that silver skull grin-
ned wider i think we better kill
you now

  pat wayland ran suddenly toward
him

 lyman-wait her voice was
urgent pleading dont you remem-
ber us-your plan-me

  silver skull stopped her with the
point of his spear

  you pretty eh his hollow eyes
surveyed her pale trembling form
my sons sam harry take you if
they want but i dont think they
want he spat outsider women
no good too soft you beat them
they die

  pat pressed forward until the spear
came against her body she held out
her slim arms imploringly

 please-lyman-remember her
husky voice was frantic remember
that you are lyman galt remember
the nebula remember your great
plan to save mankind from the holo-
caust 

  silver skull grunted and shook his
gray head

  i am no lymangal i am silver
skull i am chief of manhat i never
saw you i think you only try to trick
me i think we better kill you

  he thrust a little with the spear and
the girl went white she gripped the
shaft and her blue eyes clung des-
perately to the bearded man

  lyman-try to remember cant
you remember-long ago-that you
loved me

  old silver skull stepped back a lit-


startling stories

tie and lowered the spear his
gnarled fingerswiped a crimson drop
from the point his hollow eyes
stared at the girl he tugged bewil-
deredly at his beard

  i remember a dream he mumbled
he came riding on a horse-he
jerked his head at captain drumm-
and killed me with a little death and
i saw a dream

  his blurred eyes stared past them
and he scratched at his unkempt head

 the dream showed me many
things i saw a cloud of fire its
name is holocaust it is coming to
burn the world the outsiders must
try to find a way to escape if they
can

he peered again at pat and the
others

  you were in the dream you were
called the four his gray head
shook bewilderedly you were young
in the dream that was before sam
and harry came you still are young

i dont know

  oh lyman sobbed pat  i knew
you would remember

  silver skull spat

  i dont remember it was a dream
but go he shook the spear angrily
get out go away dont come back
i think i let you go this time but
i kill you if you come back again for
i am silver skull chief of manhat

  cartwright caught pats arm and
they all started back toward the
pioneer

  well mart the girl said shakily
i think the ideophore saved our lives
after all

  with geodes booming the pioneer
carried them back to the fortress of
the moon they dropped in the ele-
vator to the vaults of sleep pat way-
land set the clocks to wake them again
in the year two thousand and two
the aromatic gas hissed into the
sealed chambers and they slept

  the moon turned on its axis spin-
ning the months away it swung with
the earth about the sun counting off
the years in the tiny swarm of the
solar systems worlds it hurtled north-
ward decade after decade

  above the rugged peaks of ar-

zachel the earth hung ever in the
northward sky it spun through its
phases from flaming crescent to misty
disk and disk to crescent again the
lazy blinding sun crept for two long
weeks across the stars and set for two
weeks more of night

  out of the cosmic infinitude came
an atom of metal a mere few tons of
nickel iron unglimpsed by the busy
astronomers of utopia it flashed above
the rim of arzachel and struck the
central peak

  the moon continued to measure off
the months and the utopian astron-
omers saw no change in its rugged
face the earth swung through the
years to two thousand and two
a d

  that was the year  of the ob-
livion and all utopia joined in a great
festival to honor the second return of
the four scientists prepared to ex-
hibit their discoveries and the con-
gress of man was called into session
to welcome the fouij

  but the appointed day passed the
month and the year and the four did
not return

  perhaps suggested the speaker of
the congress the four have paid
utopia a secret visit without our
knowledge or perhaps they were con-
tent to observe our work from their
own mysterious place but surely
they will return when another thirty
years have gone for they promised
to visit every generation so the task
would not be forgotten

  a new festival therefore was ar-
ranged in the year  of the oblivion
but still the four did not return
there was another festival in the year
 and in  in  in  the
four did not appear

  now they will never come de-
clared the director of the last festival
for the predicted holocaust will be
upon us before another generation

  and still the moon and its mother
planet moved through the well-or-
dered complexity of their motions
and the sun drew its busy family
northward and out of the galactic
infinitude a pinch of nebular dust
moved toward an age-appointed ren-
dezvous
the fortress of utopia



  a rendezvous with the death of all
life

       chapter xiv
       the world beneath

chief silver skull was a
rude barbarian the ideophore
increased his knowledge and sharp-
ened his wits but otherwise it did not
change him greatly the second gen-
eration however made new advances

  the captured women had known
how to write and read the simplified
english of utopia the ideophore had
taught the same art to silver skull
the language of the old books in the
libraries of new york looked like a
different tongue but one of the sons
of silver skull learned how to read
them and opened all the knowledge
of the old world to the renegades

  the raids into utopia were inter-
rupted for a few years by the building
of the guarded barrier but the pris-
oners in the old metropolis presently
found a way to resume them more
cautiously

  from the very first days the sub-
ways had proved useful because of
the law the utopians had never dared
to enter them they offered a way of
passing unseen from one part to
another of the ruins and a sure hiding
place from the scouting ships and the
guards upon the towers

  it was natural to think of digging
a tunnel out under the barrier when
it was done a new degree of caution
was essential to prevent discovery of
the entrance but through the ideo-
phore silver skull knew enough of
the utopians to warn his sons of all
the probable dangers and their noc-
turnal forays were successful

  the lives of the renegades and their
children were not easy they lived
dangerously in the shadow of utopia
they got their food by hunting at
night in the forests that swiftly re-
conquered the ruins by furtively
cultivating bits of ground by fishing
in the waters they could reach they
lived without certainty but each dif-

ficulty that they conquered seemed al-
ways to prepare them to overcome
another

  when the first tunnel was com-
pleted they continued to dig others
in search of mineral wealth at first
they dug laboriously with hand tools
but the spies who went out into
utopia soon brought back the secret
of the copper-cathode power tube

  the debris from the new excava-
tions threatened for a time to clog the
old subways but a grandson of sil-
ver skull devised a compression-lock
through which it could be ejected
upon the ocean floor

  submarines powered by the copper-
cathode tubes had no need to betray
their existence by rising to the sur-
face undersea fleets found the
needed raw materials that could not
be obtained upon the land

  the under-men as they came to call
themselves built up a secret power
the network of their tunnels crossed
every continent and the domed ports
of their submarine fleets studded
every continental shelf

  in the year  of the oblivion as
the under-men had learned from the
utopians to count time chief soro
grekko brought his young son kran
back to the ruins of new york soro
grekko now the ruler of the under-
men was the great-great-grandson of
silver skull powerful dark-haired
he bore a strong resemblance to his an-
cestor this likeness was even more
striking in the case of his dark-eyed
n who was now fifteen

making two hundred miles an
hour through evacuated tubes
the private rail car of the chief
brought them to a city a mile beneath
and fifty miles to seaward of the old
metropolis they took a branch line
toward the westward petroleum dril-
lings and climbed on foot through one
of the first tunnels and at last
emerged into one of the ancient sub-
ways and mounted a crumbling stair
into the sunlight

  for a moment kran grekko was daz-
zled and then staring at the un-
familiar wonders of grass and green
trees and a silent dappled deer watch-


startling stories

ing them from a little glade and the
blue incredible splendor of the sky
above he voiced a breathless cry of
joy

  father-it-its wonderful

  the dark face of the chief grew
stern as he nodded

  it is beautiful he said soberly
vast as are the tunnels and passages
our people have made the world above
is a thousand times more spacious and
its sky is more splendid than all our
limestone caverns but come-you
shall see

  he led the way southward in the
shadow of a thick and ancient forest
the boy followed him pausing again
and again to exclaim at the wonder of
a wild flower or a squirrel or a song-
bird

  once said the grim-faced chief
our fathers lived here this so the
ancient records tell us was their
greatest city ten times more people
lived here than in all the spaces of
the under-men

  he paused pointed

  you see that long low hill with
great trees growing upon it-that was
once a row of the buildings of our
fathers time and fires and tremors
of the earth have leveled them

  but once our people dwelt here-
free to the air and the sun and the
stars

  see father the boy pointed
breathless that stone is squared
he ran to touch it hurried on why
was it father that our people were
driven under the ground really i
mean all the history books said about
it seemed so strange so hard to under-
stand

  the chief shook his dark head bit-
terly

  it has always been hard for us to
understand he said im to tell you
what we know just wait a few min-
utes until you have seen utopia-that
is what the outsiders call their
world

  the boy stopped again to point
wonderingly at a tall monument of
brown strangely graven stone that
towered alone above the trees

  look father there is one build-
ing of the old city that stands

  but it isnt of the old city the
chief told him it is far older for
the ancient books tell us that it was
first set up when civilization was
young in a forgotten land above our
cavern city of ohor it is odd that
the oldest thing should remain

 beyond the obelisk they plunged
again into the forest at last when
they came into another little glade the
boy pointed with an exclamation of
wonder into the sky

ather - what is that
above the treetops was a
round shining tower it looks as far
off as the sky

  that was the greatest house of the
old world said the chief even
the utopians have built few buildings
as large in the ancient books it is
called the empire state

  we are going to it asked the boy
  his father nodded soberly

  more than a hundred years age he
said our fathers patched the roofs
and repaired the elevators and equip-
ped them with power tubes we have
preserved the building for a watch
tower from the top of it you can
see far into utopia

  the boy caught his breath when at
last he looked from the tower man-
hattan island was a thick green forest
unbroken save by the tiny brown spire
of the obelisk wild green covered
the end of long island and a tip of
the northward mainland and a wide
border beyond the empty river

 this was the prison of our
fathers the chief gestured at the
green beyond you can see the
white towers of the barrier and be-
yond them far off in the distance you
can see the buildings of utopia
shading his eyes against the suns
unaccustomed glare kran grekko saw
the gleam of bright wide-spaced pyl-
ons upon a distant hill he saw bright
tiny flecks of ships curving above
them

 that is utopia the voice of
chief soro grekko was low and grim
the utopians rule all the world
above-the world that we should
justly share-that was denied us after
the oblivion
the fortress of utopia



  the boy was following the tiny gay
ships in the crystal distance

  what was the oblivion really
father you promised to tell me

  we have never understood the
chief told him there is no record
of it in all the old books-for the ob-
livion stopped the writing of books
we know only what our spies have
learned from the utopians-and their
ideas seem twisted and strange and
filled with curious gaps

  to them in fact it is almost a re-
ligion they believe that something
about the old world was mysteri-
ously evil and-somehow in conse-
quence of that evil-the earth was
destined to be destroyed by a strange
holocaust of fire

  but there were four scientist-
prophets in the old world-so the
utopians believe though the old
books say nothing of them-who fore-
saw this holocaust and to save the
earth from it they caused the ob-
livion

  what that really was we have
never learned but it caused men
everywhere to forget the old world
only the four remembered they
taught the utopians and led them out
of the old cities and gave them a new
law

  the law of the four forbade any
men to know the old knowledge or
enter the old places the penalty was
death our fathers were those who
broke that law the utopians could
not come into the old places to kill
them but they build the barriers to
keep us here and destroy many from
their towers

  the utopians regard the four al-
most as gods-though evidently they
never claimed to be anything but hu-
man scientists they were three men
and a beautiful woman there was a
legend that they were immortal and
would return at intervals to assure the
utopians of safety from that holo-
caust they had threatened

pytearly two hundred years

   have passed since they last
were seen but still the utopians ex-
pect them and prepare an elaborate
festival in their honor every thirty

years the utopians are strange
people

  they are very fortunate the boy
filled his lungs with cool fresh air
that was fragrant with the forest be-
neath and lifted his face to the sun
with all the wonders of this world
above they should be very happy
perhaps they are but i doubt it
said the chief men seldom value
what they have not strived for any-
how-and his face set grimly-it
will not be theirs for long

  why not the boy looked at him
wondering is the holocaust com-
ing really

  i know nothing of the holocaust
rang out the voice of soro grekko
but we are coming

  the boy blinked we

  the utopians have been our ene-
mies since the oblivion his father
told him urgently for a hundred
years and more we have planned
to burst the barriers they have set
around us and make ourselves a place
in the sun

  always they have been too strong
for us they outnumber us a thousand
to one the four taught them a
science that is not in the old books
and they have built a great new
science of their own

  i had hoped to lead the attack i
now now that i cannot but you will
my son after you are chief of the
under-men the dark eyes of soro
grekko shone fiercely you will
crush the utopians and lead your peo-
ple back into the light

  i father but i am so young
you will grow older his father
told him for the task will take you
many years but from this day on-
ward you are the conqueror of utopia
you will live for nothing else look
at those bright towers beyond the
barrier and promise me that you will
take them for the under-men

  the boys dark eyes stared for a
long time at the far-off shining pylons
at last he turned with a sober reflec-
tion of the chiefs grimness upon his
youthful features and gripped the
older mans trembling hand

  father he whispered i promise
i will take them

chapter xv
the eve of the holocaust

a sense of pressing urgency
came to cartwright as he slept
the hour had come some vague in-
sistent alarm was sounding in his
brain he struggled against strange
shackles of sleep

  he tried to move but a queer stiff
numbness held his limbs he tried to
breathe but his lungs were filled
with something sweetish choking it
took him a long time even to open his
eyes finally when the glued lids
opened he saw only an utter darkness

  a horrible dread seized him this
overwhelming darkness could be only
the darkness of the tomb it was the
closeness of his coffin that made the
air so bad this frightful silence was
the silence of the grave

  had some hideous slip of circum-
stance buried him alive

  dimly through the mists that
fogged his brain he groped for recol-
lection there was something-if
only he could remember-something
that would explain-

  unconsciously with a painful ten-
sion of effort he found himself listen-
ing he was straining desperately to
hear something to hear he knew
suddenly the ticking of a clock

  the clock had stopped

  that fact somehow set off a little
start of terror in him still however
he couldnt think why a clock should
have been buried with him-or why it
was terrible that the clock had
stopped

  there was something about the
moon dimly then he remembered
little delormes rocket falling in the
rain-forest for a moment he feared
that he was still in the rocket buried
under some tropical swamp

 then he remembered seeing de-
lormes body with the ants at it re-
membered captain drumm-the pio-
neer-the oblivion-the fortress on
the moon then he was buried-
under a crater on the moon and the
clock that had stopped was the one

that should have waked him in the
year two thousand and two

  he fought desperately as his brain
cleared to move to breathe a ter-
rible dry stiffness froze his body his
skin felt as if it were flaking off in
scales agony filled his lungs his
limbs were dead

  but he made his fingers dry and
withered and lifeless as they were
find the stud on the wall at his head
desperately he pressed it light
blinded his eyes fresh air carried
away that sickening sweetness

  for a long time he lay still content
merely to breathe the good air at last
he opened his eyes again he saw a
long ragged crack across the gray
walls and ceiling of the cell it must
have been that crack allowing the
sleep-gas to escape which caused his
awakening

  he looked at his hands they were
drawn yellowish dessicated he
touched his face it felt leathery
stiff dead a stiff mass of beard
curled down over his throat

  how long he asked himself desper-
ately had he slept fear was cold in
him hardly an inch of beard he re-
called had grown before in thirty
years of sleep

  with a dogged effort he sat up on
the bunk bones achcd dully from the
movement his muscles screamed at
effort his dry skin felt as if it were
tearing in rotten strips every labor-
ing rise and fall of his chest was
agony

he stared at the clock-face on the
massive door its hands indi-
cated four minutes and thirteen sec-
onds after midnight march  
but that meant nothing for the clock
had stopped

  he swayed to his feet his dead fin-
gers managed to open one of the
sealed water bottles on the little table
he rinsed his mouth and gulped the
reviving fluid and splashed his dry
body with it

  movement and water began to re-
store his bodys elasticity he be-
came aware of a gnawing faintness of
hunger then that was forgotten in
an impact of shuddering terror
the fortress of utopia



  something pretty violent evidently
had happened to the fortress what
had it done to the others to worth
and pat and captain drumm would
the doors and the elevator work or
were they all buried alive or dead for-
ever

  he stumbled frantically to the door
twisted a key waited trembling for its
motors to respond the whirring
seemed to falter - the door was
jammed no it moved again at last
it came open and he staggered out
into the narrow corridor before the
row of vaults

 ugly cracks crossed walls and
vaulted ceiling the floor was cov-
ered with dust and fragments of shat-
tered concrete and all the clocks in
the doors of the vaults were stopped
at that same second march  

  cartwright staggered along in front
of the doors breaking the little panes
of glass and pulling the emergency
levers that would start the mechanism
to blow out the sleep-gas he waited
swaying weakly tense with apprehen-
sion

  presently one by one the others
came stumbling out to join him cap-
tain drumms red hair had grown into
a flaming mop and his face was hid-
den by a fiery beard mart worths
pointed satanic beard was longer pat
waylands skin looked dry but her
blond beauty was not greatly changed

  in a voice curiously stiff and rusty
cartwright told them how he had
waked and ended with the fearful
question

  how long have we been sleeping
several years by the look of your
beard observed martin worth he
blinked at the cracks and the debris
a meteor must have struck the for-
tress in  so hard it stopped the
clocks

  the sleep gas must have leaked out
of your cell said pat wayland
when the cylinders were empty the
pressure fell that opened the air-
valves automatically it must have
taken a long time

  lets get out of here gasped cart-
wright and find out how long

 if we can get out muttered
worth

  the elevator however operated
without difficulty-only such delicate
instruments as the clocks had been
greatly injured the section of the
fortress upon the peak seemed scarcely
damaged looking for evidences of
the meteor cartwright could discover
only one tiny new craterlet near the
foot of the mile-high peak

  well mr astronomer he called
to mart worth how long would you
say weve been sleeping

  there was curiously no reply from
worth cartwright walked toward
him around the curving corridor that
followed the wall of the fortress and
found him peering fixedly through
one of the small northward ports

cartwright looked out beside
him the first thing that caught
his eye was the half-earth huge and
brilliant against the stars

 i wonder what has happened
there he whispered is our utopia
still-utopia but not yet did
worth answer and cartwright felt a
little tremor of alarm what do you
see mart he demanded can you
tell how long-

 there worths yellow hand
pointed are you blind

  and there low in the north and be-
low the earth cartwright saw a vast
unfamiliar cloud of darkness against
the stars it drowned lyra and cyg-
nus and cepheus and fell beyond the
ragged peaks of arzachel dull green
streaks and whorls shone ominously
within it

 is that- cartwrights voice
failed him he clutched worths
shoulder is it-

  worths yellow-skinned satanic
head nodded faintly

  it is the nebula when we went to
sleep it was a faint telescopic object
in perseus now it is spread across
eighty degrees of the sky we have
awakened on the very eve of the holo-
caust

 when- whispered cartwright
how long-

  worth shook his head

  it is approaching us at seventy
miles a second within a few weeks
we shall meet the outermost fringes


startling stories

probably it will be two months before
absorption cuts off the light of the
sun completely

  and gulped cartwright hoarse-
ly then-

   that final night said the little as-
tronomer will last a month or two
before the light of the meteor-swarms
brings the dawn of the last day he
made an odd little jerk of his dark-
bearded head i should say that life
will be possible on the earth for-at
the outside-four months longer
then boomed the voice of cap-
tain drumm behind them here is
hoping the utopians have got their
plans all laid for the safety of the
earth

  worth shook his unkempt head

  i doubt very much that they have
he said i never knew just what ex-
actly we hoped for them to do-i was
never able to see what possible human
agency would assure escape from the
nebula but at this distance the
earth looks quite unchanged and it
is already in the very maw of the
holocaust

  anyhow cartwright said well
soon be on earth to see

  not until weve eaten said cap-
tain drumm and soaked a little wa-
ter into our dessicated bones

  and added pat wayland until
youve done something about those
awful beards

chapter xvi
the children of utopia
t    i i

as the pioneer lifted them at last
above the grim walls of arzachel
and the moons dead plains the full
dreadful extent of the nebula came
into view standing rigid at the little
ships controls cartwright scanned
its vast green-shot ellipse with an ap-
prehensive awe

  it is somewhat disk-shaped said
martin worth but tilted so that it
appears flattened about sixty billion
miles in diameter the earth will
strike it somewhat toward the galactic
pole from the center

  he tugged wearily at the point of
his black beard

  call it a net of death he whis-
pered and men the fishes it is
sweeping upon us seventy miles a sec-
ond what can we possibly do about
it he shook his head galt hoped
that in two centuries our utopians
would be able to turn the trick but
i never really believed-

  he fell silent as at last they
rounded the curve of the earth and
approached the brilliant hazy convex-
ity of its sunward face a voiceless
tensity of expectation held them all
what had nearly two centuries done
to utopia

  cartwright traced the cloud-spot-
ted outline of north america

  it looks just the same he whis-
pered

  it will probably look pretty much
the same said martin worth after
it has passed through the nebula-
after the fiery hail of meteors has de-
stroyed all life on it

  pat wayland stood peering out at
the long green-tinged shadow of the
nebula her face was stiff with an
overwhelming dread her blue eyes
huge with fear from her slack lips
came a weary whisper

  what can men do against-that
she sighed there can be no escape
suddenly desperately cartwright
wanted to take her in his arms he
wanted to kiss away the terror in her
eyes and make her smile again he
shrugged and tried to send his
thoughts back to the fate of the earth

  he knew there was no use dreaming
of pat wayland

  well land at star city he an-
nounced and see whats going on at
the great observatory there

  if added martin worth there is
still an observatory there

  the convex planet flatted beneath
them star city spread out flung like
a jeweled tapestry from the mountains
to the city wheeling the little ship
above its lofty far- spaced towers its
wide roads and vast airports and well-
kept parks cartwright felt relief

  we saw no cities like this before
he said progress must have carried
on perhaps after all they have found
the fortress of utopia



a way to escape eternal destruction

  perhaps said the cynical worth

  the observatory stood upon a trun-
cated mountain between the city and
the desert long rows of laboratory
buildings marched across the leveled
summit commanded by the mighty
white dome

  cartwright dropped the pioneer
into a grassy tree-dotted court deep-
cut letters in the architrave of a splen-
did building at the end of it read
hall of atomics

  a squirrel chittered on the grass as
they climbed out of the ship fallen
leaves scattered the walks the wind
sighed faintly in the fragrant pines

  its so quiet a faint apprehen-
sion dropped cartwrights voice so
queerly still

  an observatory worth sug-
gested might be busier at night

hastened by a tense anxiety
cartwright hurried along the
walk to the hall of atomics a heavy
door yielded to his hand he entered
a heavy silence met him the air was
dead heavy with stale chemical odors

  he went along the great central cor-
ridor peering into the doors that
opened from it huge well-lit labora-
tory rooms were filled with apparatus
that was mostly unfamiliar all of it
was covered with a heavy film of dusk
he went solemnly back to the others
who were waiting at the door

  theres nobody-anywhere some-
thing made him whisper it has all
been abandoned for years he led
the way back toward the pioneer
we had better go down to the city
and find out what is the matter

  perhaps said captain drumm
hopefully they have advanced so far
they dont need laboratories any
more

  mart worth grinned sardonically

  perhaps

  they were climbing aboard the lit-
tle ship when suddenly pat wayland
caught her breath and pointed
thrumming softly the long tapered
spindle of a geoflexor flier came glid-
ing down above the deserted build-
ings

  the gaily painted craft landed a

hundred yards away beside a dancing
fountain a little crowd of men and
women trooped out laughing they
were oddly and brightly clad in stuff
that looked like silk one of them
strummed a musical instrument care-
lessly while the others spread gay
cloths under the trees and brought
baskets from the flier

  picnicking in the shadow of
death murmured martin worth
they have forgotten the danger of
the nebula

  but cartwright fancied a keenness
almost of hysteria in their laughter
he caught anxious glances toward the
northward sky-where the days se-
rene blue hid the black cloud of the
nebula

  lets speak to them

  he called the picnickers discov-
ered the pioneer with the four stand-
ing about the steps for a moment
there was an astounded incredulous
silence then a wild shout

  the four it is the four-re-
turned to save us from the holo-
caust 

  dropping the baskets they came
running to make an awed little ring
about the pioneer their faces were
eagerly smiling they reached out
trembling doubtful hands to touch the
metal of the little ship

  you really are the four the
speaker was an alert gray-haired man
his eyes were burning with a tortured
anxiety tell us-have you really
come to save us

  we are the four cartwright ad-
mitted but there was never any-
thing that we could do about the holo-
caust we only hoped that our efforts
would enable men to save them-
selves

  he searched the utopians taut face
and asked

  have we failed

  the utopian slowly shook his gray
head and the brightness of hope upon
his face gave way to a weary despair

  im afraid he whispered that we
have all failed he made a tired ges-
ture to include the laboratory build-
ings and the mighty dome of the ob-
servatory once i worked here he
said before the laboratory was


startling stories

closed i was an assistant to essen-
dee the great atomic physicist once
i remember he told me he had seen
a ray of hope but-

  the utopian made a weary little
shrug of defeat

    wthat was the matter cart-
w w wright demanded what
made you fail

  our philosophers still argue over
that said the utopian but i believe
the truth is simple enough in the
first two centuries very little was done
-merely because men who expected
to die before he arrival of the holo-
caust felt little interest in it it was
difficult for men to assume responsi-
bility for posterity and the failure
of the four to return as you had
promised was a discouraging factor

  cartwright nodded

  we didnt disappoint you inten-
tionally but go on

  thirty or forty years ago the
utopian said when men began to
realize that the holocaust would ar-
rive within their own lifetimes there
was a sudden spurt of advancement a
hundred outstanding scientists ap-
peared too late

  you understand the appalling diffi-
culty of the problem of averting the
nebula collision from whatever
angle it is attacked the obstacles are
stupendous and-so it has always
seemed to me-the utopian tempera-
ment was poorly fitted to cope with
them

  how do you mean asked cart-
wright

  the gray utopian made a gesture in
the direction of the unseen metropolis
below

  you saw star city all the cities
of utopia are like that they are
beautiful all ugliness all pain all
strife have been eliminated all men
work together for the good of all

  that i believe is the plan that the
four made for utopia it was a good
plan good in itself but sometimes
our philosophers have suspected that
it left out something made life too
automatic too easy i dont wish to
criticize-

  thats all right cartwright said

what you say may be quite true
the gray man nodded soberly

  i know it is since we abandoned
the laboratories i have made a gar-
den there i have seen how culti-
vated plants breed out they become
weak easy prey for drouth and
blights ever and again we must start
anew with a hybrid strain crossed
from plants that have been toughened
by a harder struggle to survive
you say cartwright demanded
that you abandoned the laboratories
why

  dread stiffened the utopians face
that was nearly twenty years ago
he whispered until then we had
hope essendee believed that he had
found a way he stared at the great
silent buildings and shook his head
we might have beaten the holo-
caust

  well insisted cartwright what
stopped you

the vanishings said the utopian

chapter xvii
terror by nighl

cartwright peered in aston-
ishment at the gray utopian

  vanishings he echoed what
do you mean

  the utopian shook his head

  the vanishings are a mystery that
we have never solved he said about
twenty years ago the best of our
scientists began to disappear from
their laboratories apparatus books
and notes were taken too

  the vanishings always happened
at night they kept on happening in
spite of all we could do scientists
were taken from under the noses ct
armed guards and out of locked roms
we set various scientific traps with
invisible rays and such in vain

  queerly the scientists who were
taken were almost invariably those
working on the problem of escaping
the holocaust essendee himself
escaped after a battle with an uniden-
tified midnight intruder in this very
observatory but practically every
the fortress of utopia



other man who had accomplished any-
thing at all toward saving the earth
was abducted

  cartwright was staring at him

  a very strange story he muttered

  it was incredible to us at hrst
said the utopian for there had been
no crime in utopia every person has
his own secure place in the commun-
ity and all his education is directed to
make him fit that place there is no
need for crime

  we had no police organization
here in star city until the vanishings
began then we organized a force
they did their best first to protect
the scientists and then to find what
had become of them but all efforts
failed and at last our observatories
and laboratories were all abandoned
just for the want of able men to carry
on

  queer muttered cartwright
very queer

  now said the utopian-whose
name he told them was arro four-
nine-will you come down into star
city we must tell utopia that the
four have returned your presence
will give people courage to await the
holocaust

  assenting cartwright brought the
utopian aboard the pioneer at his
direction they landed the little ship
upon a great pillar in one of the citys
vast parks

  this is the pier of the four said
arro fournine it was made ready
for you one hundred and fifty years
ago

  above the platform towered a huge
stone likeness of the pioneer a hun-
dred feet in diameter their statues
stood in a colossal group beside it
giants towering forty feet tall

  a gay-clad joyously shouting
throng was pouring into the park
cheers rolled wave on wave of sound
against the great pillar at last the
thousands grew silent waiting for the
four to speak

  cartwright made a halting and un-
comfortable little talk he regretted
the failure of the four to return when
they had promised he was sorry that
the utopians had failed to do anything
about the holocaust the time was

now very short he was not hopeful
but the four would see what if any-
thing could be done

  silent now the utopians began to
disperse

  trying to start a panic inquired
captain drumm standing beside the
pioneer

tts time they faced the facts
jbl cartwright said doesnt it
seem to you that they are sort of child-
like and naive their world has been
too perfect for their own good life
has been too easy for them they have
never learned to face realities when
this supreme danger comes along they
havent been trained to meet it they
just give up appalled at their own
helplessness

  he looked at the tense faces of
drumm and worth and pat wayland

  is there anything that we can do-
anything at all

  the girl shook her platinum head
i dont know of anything
cartwright turned to worth
would any sort of ark be possible
to carry men to some planet of another
star

  the little astronomer tugged at his
pointed black beard

  that is probably our only possible
chance he said and it is fantas-
tically slender it would be very diffi-
cult to build any sort of interstellar
ship in the few months of time now
left to us and even if we had the best
ship we can design ready to take off
today the chances are that it would
itself be overtaken by the nebula be-
fore it could build up sufficient vel-
ocity to escape

  but insisted cartwright is it
possible

  barely possible admitted mart
worth but even if men did escape
in an ark of space where would they
go probably only one star in a hun-
dred thousand has any planets at all
perhaps one planet in a hundred
thousand happens to meet the condi-
tions for human life

  he shrugged hopelessly

  what ship could visit a hundred
thousand stars

  still persisted cartwright weve


startling stories

simply got to go on and try some-
thing

  before we plan anything definite
said martin worth i want to study
the nebula from the observatory here
a great deal of it you remember was
below the horizon from the citadel
he called to the gray-haired utop-
ian who was standing at a little dis-
tance and asked

  will you help us use the great
observatory tonight

 the thin face of arro fournine
turned pale and he made an anxious
gesture of protest

  i told you about the vanishings
we dont use the observatory any
more it is safe enough by day but
at night-

  his voice trailed off huskily and
his fingers twisted nervously

  i must make the observations
worth insisted to find out how long
we have and as for any mysterious
haunters-

  all the vs of his face sharpened
to the old cynical grin

  after all captain drumm told the
frightened utopian we are the four
i think we can take care of ourselves
but we need you to show us the way
about

  they were staring at the utopian
ill go with you he said at last
for the sake of utopia he shrug-
ged unhappily i can see that you
are skeptical of what i have told you
i only hope that your skepticism is
not rudely shattered

the red sun was setting when the
pioneer dropped them again amid
the majestic buildings upon the lev-
eled mountain top they came off
into the silent neglected grounds pat
wayland shivered to the chill of eve-
ning in the air worth pointed
solemnly at the sunset-red upon the
huge white dome

  the first warning he said softly
what do you mean asked cart-
wright

  the first tenuous wisp of the ne-
bula must have already touched us
said martin worth there is a slow
accumulation of microscopic dust
motes in the upper atmosphere they

absorb the violet end of the spectrum
today a red sunset his voice
dropped to an ominous whisper to-
morrow a rain of fire

  arro fournine kept anxiously close
to them as they entered the great
dusky buildings the air was heavy
musty dust lay thick the silence
became terrible to cartwright it be-
came as appalling as the dead stillness
of the moon he started to tiny mock-
ing echoes

  they came at last into the huge
dome that covered the main telescope
arro fournine in a dry nervous voice
explained the few novel features of
the equipment to martin worth

  electric motors opened the slit in
the dome as it turned slowly toward
the north the red of sunset gave way
to the dim shadow of the nebula

  cartwright touched worths arm

 an odd thing he commented
there was dust everywhere in the
halls but you notice there is none
in here

  the little astronomer nodded tug-
ging in a puzzled way at his pointed
beard

  so i noticed he whispered it
is odd too that the telescope operates
perfectly the oil is not gummed in
the motors there is no rust the mir-
ror still has an excellent polish

  his whisper sank lower still

 you would almost believe he
added that the observatory has been
in constant use his dark hollow eyes
shot an uneasy glance at arro four-
nine we shall see what we shall
see

  worth climbed to the observers
seat at the side of the great tube the
utopian took his place at the switch-
board from which lights and motors
were controlled armed with the
little paralysis guns pat wayland and
captain drumm and cartwright
moved watchfully about the vast floor

  night fell without the ominous
red afterglow faded at last the bale-
ful darkness of the nebula thickened
against the northward constellations
touched eerily here and there with
green

  as the hours passed cartwright
could not protect himself from a
the fortress of utopia



mounting fear he tried not to be-
lieve the utopians queer story about
the vanishings it seemed quite in-
credible the truth he tried to tell
himself was that these oddly child-
like people were hysterical with ter-
ror probably some of their scientists
had merely abandoned a task that
looked hopeless had run away to
cscape responsibility and the story
had grown with twenty years

  he shook his head in the thick
gloom that filled the observatory
even that didnt fit nothing did
there was some missing factor whose
absence made the whole thing seem a
little insane

he wanted to whistle to break that
terrible silence he paced the
stone floor of the great dome rest-
lessly peering vainly into its vast
dark spaces then silence abruptly be-
came mad confusion

  pat wayland made a little gasping
cry captain drumm bellowed a
shout and his paralysis gun began to
ping the utopian screamed the
lights went out yellow flame spurted
against the darkness and gunshots re-
verberated against the dome

  cartwright heard a dry rustling
near him he thought he glimpsed a
gray shapeless shadow moving he
flung up the paralysis gun but be-
fore he could fire a dazzling blue light
flashed in his eyes and left him blind

  jay terror edged pats warning
cry behind you

  he spun his ears caught some
little slither of sound and he swung
his fist at it the blow met nothing
flung forward by the force of it he
tripped over something small his
head struck the floor dazingly

  jay-mart-cap pat waylands
muffled voice became a scream
theyve got-

  it ceased abruptly

  the lights shouted cartwright
he found the switchboard snapped on
the dim shaded electrics vaguely
they showed the huge interior of the
dome the massive telescope captain
drumm was standing near the base of
it nolding the smoking automatic that
he had dragged out of a shoulder hol-

ster martin worth was still in his
lofty seat

  but pat wayland was gone

 you fournine shouted cart-
wright where-

  he realized abruptly that the utop-
ian had vanished also

       chapter xviii
       the ark of space

alertly gripping their weapons
they scattered over the vast floor
of the dim-lit dome searching cart-
wright peered into shadows under the
great telescope he tried half a dozen
doors that all were locked at last
the three came back into an apprehen-
sive little group

  not a clue muttered cartwright
i dont see what could have become
of them

  little martin worth pointed at the
slit in the great dome that looked out
toward the green-shot darkness of the
nebula

  theres a hole you could fly the
pioneer through

  drumms red head shook

  we should have seen the shadow
against the nebula slowly he re-
placed his heavy automatic in the hol-
ster under his shirt i didnt quite
trust that fournine guy he said
there was something fishy about his
story of the vanishings

  i thought i saw a gray thing mov-
ing cartwright said and somebody
flashed a blue light in my eyes it
might have been our utopian friend
i suppose-if he had a secret exit
he shook his head

  anyhow pats gone-thats what
matters

  for a little time they simply stood
there looking at one another
drumms bronzed face usually so
ruddy and cheerful looked pale and
grim the sardonic sparkle was gone
from worths dark eyes he was tug-
ging moodily at his beard

  cartwright was hardly conscious of
the stiffness of his own face the trem-
bling of his lip until worth looked


startling stories

at him with a twisted grin on his nar-
row satanic face

  cheer up jay urged the little as-
tronomer after all weve none of
us got more than three months to live
before the nebula bakes the earth like
an apple maybe pat is the lucky
one

  at the break in his voice cart-
wright made a bitter little laugh

  you look solemn enough yourself
mart he said funny thing here
were all on the edge of tears but if
w ever see pat again all well get will
be some crack sharp enough to cut
your heart open

  drumm stiffened angrily

  maybe-but that is just pats way
he peered away again into the dim-lit
spaces of the dome he listened and
shook his red head wearily what
could have taken her

  cartwright saw the gleam of a tear
falilng into worths black beard the
little astronomer shook himself an-
grily

  weve got enough else to worry
about he said softly with a weary
little gesture toward the green-and-
black of the nebula my observations
were pretty well complete-and we
have somewhat less time than i had
thought

 how-

  a sudden aching constriction
choked off cartwrights voice for all
the malice mingled with her sweet-
ness he knew he loved pat wayland
fear for her was a cold sickness in
him but he tried resolutely to thrust
her blond loveliness out of his mind

  how long have we

  it will probably be less than a
month before the radiation of the sun
is cut off completely worth said
softly then it will get cold i dont
know how cold perhaps the air wont
freeze the cold will last perhaps an-
other month-the time depends upon
the local condensations we strike

hen the rain of meteors will
end that final night they will
burn the oxygen out of the atmos-
phere and boil away the seas and bat-
ter down the continents-but we wont
be here to see it

  then we have perhaps two months
to do-whatever we can do

  worth nodded probably no more
perhaps less he grinned a mirth-
less grin thats doubtless long
enough for all that we can do
weve got to try cartwright said
were not utopians first well do
whatever we can about pat-make a
search outside and report what hap-
pened to the utopian authorities-
which worth put in cynically
should help a lot

  then cartwright went on i
want to get in touch with the best of
the surviving utopian scientists-our
missing friend said i believe that this
essendee escaped well discus what-
ever plan they can offer add our own
knowledge and see what can be done
they found the utopian scientist
the next day at his cottage in the
alps a thin bent sharp-eyed man
whose beard was the gray replica of
worths he was sitting over a chess-
board he moved a white piece and
the black moved automatically

  he rose stiffly to greet them

  for twenty years he told them
ever since i gave up building the ark
ive been working on this he
touched the board and shook his bald
brown head still i can give it three
pieces and win

  so you had planned an ark said
cartwright why did you give it
up

  you know how hopeless it is to
seek another habitable planet the
only hope seemed to lie in building a
vessel large enough to be a little
world itself in which our little col-
ony could survive indefinitely-until
perhaps the earth some centuries
after its passage through the nebula
might cool and become habitable
again

  yes-but what was the difficulty
we failed to find any source of
power that would move so large
a craft said essendee his bald head
shook wearily our copper-cathode
power tubes are quite inadequate even
for interplanetary flight i was at
work on a gold-cathode tube at the
time the vanishings began that
promised to succeed-but for the
the fortress of utopia



scarcity of sufficient gold here in
utopia

  i think we can find gold-if your
tubes will work cartwright said it
was the vanishings then that caused
your abandonment of the project

  the aged utopian nodded

  all my ablest fellow workers were
taken he said all my efforts to
find them failed a panic spread
among the few who were left they
fled from the laboratories i could do
nothing alone and i-i was also
afraid

  his hollow eyes stared at him

 can you comprehend the meaning
of it men who have worked beside
you for years-whisked away without a
trace no clue anywhere the grow-
ing belief that you are being mocked
by some totally unknown and far su-
perior science the ghastly feeling of
a secret and unescapable surveillance
the growing conviction that you are
going to be next

  the old voice cracked

  finally one night i was attacked
i escaped-and quit

  but now you will help us design
and build an ark

  essendee nodded gravely

ffw will he said i believe that
every utopian will rally to your
aid-unless as some believe the van-
ishings are the work of a secret so-
ciety who have set out to overturn
the law of the four

  he pushed aside the chessboard
well cartwright said we had
better begin at once

 i suggest boomed captain
drumm that we begin drawing up
the preliminary plans tonight and
also set about getting the official ma-
chinery in motion to supply men and
transportation and materials

  and i said martin worth sug-
gest that we build the ark somewhere
in antarctica cold there perhaps
but in a few weeks all the earth will
be colder and since the earth will
strike the nebula north pole-first the
southern regions will be more or less
protected from stray meteors-though
it will be uncomfortable enough even
there after the atmosphere becomes

incandescent

  good idea cartwright agreed
now shall we begin with the plans

  he caught the furtive glance of the
little utopian scientist and saw the
haunted look within his hollow eyes
he knew that the vanishings were
still as terrible to essendee as the
on-rushing holocaust

three days later cartwright and
captain drumm aboard the pi-
oneer led a little fleet of utopian geo-
flexor fliers to antarctica a site was
selected for the ark of space upon a
bleak mountain ridge within ten de-
grees of the pole

  in the warming rays of huge heat-
ers fed from banks of copper-cathode
tubes-for this was june the middle
of the polar night-ten thousand men
under the brisk orders of captain
drumm began leveling the ridge and
building the mile-long foundation for
the ark

  worth remained in utopia complet-
ing the plans already all the mills
and foundries of three continents were
busy turning out plates and girders
for the tremendous metal cylinder that
might become the second home of
man an endless line of great geo-
flexor freighters brought them to the
great illuminated yard on the desert of
ice

  cartwright accepted the task of
finding fuel for the ark he went
through a simple ceremony to amend
a certain section of the law of the
four then he led a crew to a low
grass-covered mound in what once had
been kentucky

  the defenses that a nation had built
to guard its buried hoard proved stub-
born for endless weeks with the ap-
palling green-lit cloud of the nebula
growing larger in the sky night by
night cartwrights crews drilled and
blasted at last the reluctant earth
yielded its reclaimed treasure

  cartwright returned to antarctica
in the pioneer carrying a barge loaded
with a thousand tons of yellow in-
gots arching high above the atmos-
phere he saw a new and ominous
halo of crimson about the sun he
was glad to see that the long hull of


startling stories

the ark lying in the glare of a thou-
sand great searchlights looked almost
complete

 captain drumm and mart worth
however when he found them leaning
over blueprints in a bare little wooden
shack in the shadow of the ark looked
worried

 well we opened fort knox like
an oyster he said weve got the
gold whats the matter now

  little worth tugged soberly at his
black beard

hings arent going so well
he confessed and then asked
hopefully you didnt find out any-
thing more-about pat

  cartwright shook his head

  i went back three times to star
city the utopian authorities havent
found out anything-and dont expect
to i made a gang of them turn the
observatory upside down all over
again we didnt find a thing but
whats the matter here

  captain drumm shook his red head
its these damned utopians his
great bronzed fists made an angry ges-
ture they drive you mad

 whats the trouble with them
they seem willing enough

 too damned willing muttered
captain drumm thats the trouble
they have no aggressiveness no inde-
pendence when any difficulty comes
up they dont dont set their chins and
tackle it they smile and wait for
somebody to help them give me a
gang of old world rough-necks-and
damn your utopians

  just what is the situation

  the way things are going mart
worth said it will take us at least
five more weeks to complete the hull
install the geodes and power plants
provision the ark bring aboard our
selected colonists and the animals we
shall try to save and take off

  weve time enough to do all that
we can get away from earth all right
the danger will come afterwards
afterwards

  when we take off worth said
the ark will still have a velocity of
nearly seventy miles a second with
reference to the nebula it is so large

that it will take a long time even with
the gold-cathode power tubes to ab-
sorb that momentum and turn back to-
ward safety too long im afraid

  the little astronomer made a weary
shrug then his dark hollow eyes fast-
ened upon cartwrights face with a
peculiar intensity

  however he said softly there is
another possibility

  cartwright met his searching stare
wondering

  what is that

  from my telescopic studies of the
nebula worth said i suspect that
the edges of it separate into spiral
arms between those arms there are
doubtless rifts even if we lack time
to get completely out of the path of
the nebula we might reach one of
those rifts-if we had the rifts mapped
out

  cartwright nodded slowly

 i see and im to do the map-
ping

  that of course is up to you i
cant very well leave the job of design-
ing the geodes im afraid that their
installation wouldnt progress very
fact without drumm to boss the job
and it is the sort of thing that your
utopian simply wouldnt care to
tackle

 of course ill go cartwright
said

 captain drumm gripped his hand

  i knew you would he said and
i almost envy you his bronzed face
smiling wistfully whether you ever
get back or not it will be the greatest
flight a man ever made damn these
utopians

ff lrumm tried to talk himself
mw into the job worth grinned
grew sober again you had better
spend a couple of days overhauling
the pioneerhe said we have built
a et of gold-cathode tubes to be in-
stalled instead of the old silver ones-
they will nearly double her power
the star-cameras are ready

  the thing is to fly straight out in
the ecliptic plane toward the present
position of saturn about eight days
of acceleration and eight more of de-
celeration that will put you a little
the fortress of utopia



beyond jupiters orbit

  expose the plates there and then
come back-if you can if you make
it that will take another sixteen days
by that time the ark ought to be done
you can tell us whether a passage ex-
ists-or whether we ought to be call-
ing it an oven instead of an ark

       chapter xix
       into the nebula

martin worth gripped cart-
wrights hand two days had
gone equipped with the new power
tubes the big star-camera installed
the pioneer was ready to fly little
worth tried to grin his old sardonic
grin

  all right jay he said softly
and dont expose all your plates with
the slide still over them

  cartwright laughed at the catch in
his voice and felt a sudden little ache
in his own throat he turned to cap-
tain drumm splendid in his crimson
and gold braid drumm saluted
briskly

  so long jay he said dont
run into any asteroids

  cartwright saw the gleam in his blue
eyes saw him turn and cough he
climbed hastily into the little metal
egg of the pioneer and shut the mas-
sive valve behind him

  the geodes thrummed and the lit-
tle ship lifted above the ark of space
bathed in a lake of blue light the
mile-long craft lay amid the glaciers
the wind-whipped clouds of an
antarctic blizzard obscured it and
the geoflexor mounted into space

  the appalling green-lined shadow
of the nebula came again into view
the earth contracted to a circle of
darkness against the stars its at-
mosphere was a ring of crimson that
wavered and leapt as if the fire of the
nebula were already consuming it

  the sun when at last it crept into
view beside the receding earth was
surrounded with a wide halo of blood-
red light the strangeness of it made
him shudder with an invincible ap-

prehension of the inescapable doom

  the drum of the geodes faltered ab-
ruptly a dead pocket with the old
deft skill he skirted it kept the geodes
in mesh and escaped its treacherous
boundaries

  as the ships chronometer ticked
away the dragging hours cartwright
stared often in an appalled unwilling
fascination at the nebula it resem-
bled an angry thundercloud here it
shone dimly with the eerie green that
once was thought to betray a new ele-
ment nebulium there another
mass was black against the green the
vanishing stars at the advencing
edges of it all turned feebly red

  no motion of it was perceptible to
the eye yet as time crept away he
could see that boiling currents had
changed the ominous outlines of it
he could never forget that it was
plunging to engulf the solar system
seventy miles a second

  often too in those endless hours
that grew into eternal days he
thought of pat wayland her bland
blue-eyed baby-face dwelt in his mind
her platinum hair was a bright web
that meshed his thoughts the sweet
malice of her smile haunted his
dreams

  vainly he tried to forget her

  pats just an adding machine he
tried to tell himself with an uncom-
fortable sense of humor and a stream-
lined case

  but he knew that was a lie he had
glimpsed the real aching humanity of
the girl he couldnt help a deep pity
for whatever cruel experience had
made her what she was and he could
never forget that he loved her

a thousand times he reviewed
the evening in the great observa-
tory when she had vanished he ran
over a hundred fantastic solutions to
the mystery-invisible men cables let
down through the slit in the dome
some unspeakable duplicity on the
part of arro fournine-and knew
they were all fantastic

 he knew that he wanted-even
more than he wanted to save his own
life-to find pat wayland somehow
before the holocaust should drown


startling stories

the earth in the fire of eternal holo-
caust

 even he muttered to himself
though there would probably be a
dash of poison in the honey of her
thanks

 arching out to southward of the
ecliptic plane where collision with
the cosmic debris of the asteroid belt
would be less probable he locked the
pioneer upon the controls twenty
hours had passed since the take-off
when he lay down on one of the long
seats and pulled a blanket over him

  and still he couldnt sleep a fear
of meteors haunted him the ship was
armored with two inches of good steel
but he couldnt forget that a missile
striking it with twenty or forty times
the velocity of a rifle bullet would
carry four hundred or sixteen hun-
dred times the energy a nickel-iron
fragment the size of a walnut-

  he shut his eyes and turned over

  he woke with a start trembling and
tense he had dreamed that a ragged
gigantic boulder was plunging out of
the lurid green-black curtains of the
nebula while he struggled desperately
with the controls of the pioneer

 melodramatic he whispered to
himself at thirty miles a second it
could be the size of a barn and still
youd never see what hit you

  when he woke again clutching out
in frantic alarm the bunk had dropped
away from him the blanket cush-
ioned his impact against the top of
the hull but he was sick with the
vertigo of an endless fall

 the reek of burning insulation
somehow cleared his dizzy brain this
was a dead pocket the pilotless ship
had plunged into the heart of it now
the geodes were burning up with their
unspent power

  he snatched at a handrail pulled
himself desperately forward the ship
spun about him now and then the
fields seemed to mesh unevenly for an
instant setting it to whirling in a new
direction

  but he reached the controls cut
the power waited for the heated
coils to cool for momentum to help
carry the ship out of danger then
carefully he returned the coils inched

the power open as the ship crossed the
pocket

  at last the geodes were thrumming
again with a full strong note the
ship was off her course plunging
straight into the nebulas green-shot
heart he pulled it back toward the
tawny fleck of saturn

  after a few minutes sure that the
dead pocket was safely behind he
opened the little cabinet that served as
a galley and poured steaming coffee
from a thermos jug his hands still
trembled evidently the flight was
going to be no picnic

he had not anticipated much trou-
ble from the dead pockets
worths latest theory connected them
with sun-spots and he believed that
they occurred only in the vicinity of
strong gravitational fields

  perhaps he began to suspect the
approach of the nebula had some con-
nection with them for as the days
went by their appalling interruptions
became more and more frequent

  he had to sleep yet he could never
leave the controls without the haunt-
ing fear that the geodes would be
burned out while the ship spun help-
less in some dead pocket before he
could shut off the power

 that would be the end not only
for himself alone but for martin
worth and captain drumm and the
ark of space-the end for all he
thought of pat wayland

  at last the pioneer came to rest
nearly half a billion miles from earth
preparing to expose the plates in the
big star-camera cartwright was ap-
palled at sight of the nebula

  it had spread to hide all the north-
ern constellations lurid green shone
beyond the black masses of it like
sinister lightning the spiral arms of
it reached out like hideous limbs
groping for the stars

  but he saw a pale reddish speck in
the midst of its green-black clouds
and voiced a hoarse little cry of ela-
tion for that speck was vega shin-
ing through the nebula it was a bea-
con in the passage that worth had
hoped he would discover

  whistling happily against the res-
the fortress of utopia



onance of the hull he finished expos-
ing the plates and turned the pio-
neer back toward the tiny red-veiled
sun his tune was interrupted by an
appalling deafening crash

  as the reverberation of the hull
died away he listened with ringing
ears for the fatal hiss of air escaping
there was none but that meteor as
he soon discovered had been but one
of the swarms that had strayed ahead
of the nebula

  ever and again as he drove the pio-
neer back toward the earth the hull
rang alarmingly standing hour by
hour at the curving control board it
was difficult to keep his mind from
a grim mathematics of life and death

  for the velocity of the ship was in-
creasing at full acceleration that
meant the same thing as regards the
probability of collision as a vast in-
crease in its length-besides making
every collision far more dangerous

  the dead pockets too were ever
more frequent ever and again doz-
ing over the controls he woke to find
himself being tossed about the madly
spinning ship the air reeking with
smoke from the hot coils

  at last he reached the midpoint of
the return and gratefully began de-
celeration

  the nebula was all about him now
the sun still burned feebly through
it a dull blood-red disk but all the
stars even in the south were blotted
out and he began to be tormented
by a fear that even the sun would be
hidden-that he would be lost in the
nebula without any familiar point of
reference

  he was thin and jumpy with fa-
tigue his yellow hair was unkempt
a new stubble of straw-colored beard
covered his hollow face his eyes were
red and sunken he began to feel that
he would gladly give all his chance
to escape the nebula just for a peace-
ful sleep

as the dim sun grew back to nor-
mal size however a fierce ela-
tion mounted in him he was coming
through with the precious plates he
had found the path of safety he had
done his job

 he found the earth to sunward
of him its thin half-circle was dim in
the haze of the nebula it was red
with an appalling light crescent of
crimson fire he couldnt help a shud-
der staring at it for it was doomed

  yes whatever happened the earth
was doomed even if the ark of space
by some miracle of good fortune car-
ried its little colony to some other
habitable planet there could be only a
half-life waiting for them

 for man was part of earth for
millions upon millions of years life
had been shaped and patterned to the
days and the seasons the winds and
the tides to every smallest aspect of
this planet that was home man cart-
wright knew would fit no other

  he was staring in a kind of bleak
apathy at that dim red crescent be-
low the nearer crescent of the moon
he tried to rouse himself to recover
his lost elation only half a million
miles to go only five hours-

  then the meteor struck

  the concussion was something be-
yond description as sound it struck
cartwright like a dazing blow reel-
ing from it he saw a glare of incan-
descence he felt pain where a drop-
let of molten steel struck his face

  for an instant the reek of his own
burnt flesh was in his nostrils and
then it was gone he heard no rush
of escaping air because his ringing
ears were deaf but he saw the flutter
of a star-chart-

  saw it vanish through a ragged hole
behind him

  for a moment he stared paralyzed
at the nebulas dull green he felt a
stabbing pain in his ears a roaring
pressure in his head the swift invol-
untary expiration then his lungs
strove for breath and found only the
agony of asphyxiation

  for the air was gone from the ship

the pressure in cartwrights head
became a bursting agony it was


startling stories

popping out his blinded eyes he felt
the hot spurt of blood in ears and nos-
trils but still in the vacuum that
had conquered the ship he lived

  he would live for seconds perhaps
for even a minute until the stored
oxygen in his blood was exhausted

  he stumbled first toward the gap-
ing hole in the top of the hull but
it was three feet long larger by far
than any of the emergency patches in
the rack there was only one chance-

  he reached the air-lock blindly
fumbling he caught the inner valve
swung it open weak reeling sway-
ing he tumbled into the cramped lit-
tle space of it he tried to close the
valve

  but a cold prickling had come over
his body now it ceased but it left
a dead numbness his limbs were re-
mote dead things that refused to
obey his brain he tried to cough
the strangling blood out of his throat
but in a vacuum a man cannot cough

  the metal vibrated to the closing
valve but he heard no sound he
turned the seal-valve a cold weight
of darkness was plunging down upon
him he strove against it his dead
fingers found the air valves

  and at last the oxyhelium breath-
ing mixture hissed into the lock
gulping it in great painful gasps he
slumped down into a dim half-con-
sciousness desperately he hungered
for rest for peace for oblivion but
a second emergency came swift on the
heels of the first

  the throb of the geodes ceased
the ship lurched and dropped he
knew that it was in another dead
pocket-and that the overheating coils
would soon be ruined unless he
reached the controls

  he snatched his pressure-suit off its
hook still trembling his aching
lungs gasping he climbed into it and
closed the zippers and pumped the
pneumatic seal

  the blood still streaming from his
nostrils spattered the face-plate of the
helmet half-blinding him but he
opened the valve again and stumbled
to the controls

  his thick-gloved fingers trembling
clumsily on the levers he worked the

ship out of the dead pocket the
geodes drummed out again apparently
uninjured peering through the red-
splattered plate he found the dim red
orb of the sun again

  for an endless terrible minute he
thought that earth and moon had been
lost in the thickening clouds of the
nebula but at last he discovered
their dim red crescents and set a fresh
course for earth

  the main air-tank on his suit was
presently exhausted but it was easy
to replace it with a spare from the
racks at last triumphantly he
brought the pioneer down toward that
bare granite ridge amid the glaciers
of antarctica eagerly he followed
it seeking the ark of space

  the lights were out that was the
first alarming thing he saw he had
left the mighty cylinder bathed in a
thousand searchlights now they
were dead without their guidance
he searched for a long time across the
dimly green-lit desert of ice

  at last he discovered the mighty
mile-long hull standing high upon its
shoring stiffened with a strange ap-
prehension he dropped the mote of
the pioneer beside it no man was
alive there to greet him

tools lay scattered on the ice
the great dock beneath the gang-
ways was stacked with crated and
bagged and barreled supplies with
walls of gold ingots and snow was
drifted everywhere

  snow banked the golden walls it
half covered the abandoned tools it
whitened the mountains of supplies
an antarctic blizzard had raged here
he knew since the ark had been aban-
doned it must have been many days
ago

  he tried to reconstruct the scene to
find some meaning in the mute ice-
bound clues about him his mind saw
the picture as it must have been be-
fore that mysterious tragedy

  the ark of space looming splendid
above the barren glaciers-the last
hope of mankind the swarming
workmen dwarfed to insects by its
tremendous bulk busy with a thou-
sand final details stevedores loading
the fortress of utopia



the last cargo of earth animals driv-
en up the gangways two by two the
selected passengers crowding aboard
with their goods hastening toward the
promise of a new world and a new life
armed guards doubtless holding
back hysterical relatives and friends
the frantic mob of the doomed then
suddenly-what

  cartwright grappled with enigma
the ark had been suddenly abandoned
there were signs of a battle the sup-
plies and the billions of dollars in gold
had not been disturbed the people
-captain drumm and mart worth
and the thousands of their utopian
followers-were simply gone the
thing was as utterly and numbingly
mysterious as the vanishing of pat
wayland

  perhaps he thought the same un-
known agency had been to blame in
his first account of the vanishings
arro fournine had said that all those
taken had been working on the prob-
lem of escape from the holocaust
was there some veiled scientific
power which had decreed that men
should not survive the nebula

  things began to look that way to
cartwright

 now-what next

  there was nothing so far as he
could see it was now obviously too
late for the ark to be completed even
if work on it could be resumed its
building had been the final effort and
that had failed there was nothing
else

  for a long time cartwright stood
gazing hopelessly out through the
ports of the pioneer at the unfinished
hulk of the ark and the twilit desert of
ice beyond his weary mind groped
for some course of action but there
was none

  he came back at last to the needs
of his own body he was trembling
exhausted for all those weeks of the
flight he had not slept sufficiently or
eaten properly or been able to relax
he had not recovered from his ordeal
in the vacuum

  mechanically he opened the face-
plate of his helmet and cleaned the
dried blood from it he attached a
fresh oxyhelium tank to the pressure

suit at last wearily he lifted the
pioneer once more to the citadel on
the moon

  that was a refuge beyond the reach
he supposed of whatever had taken all
his companions and the men from the
ark he could sleep there he could
rest and there was nothing else that
mattered any more for the world
was lost

  the moon was queerly transformed
in the dim crimson twilight but he
found high-walled arzachel and
brought the pioneer down toward the
central peak the white citadel was
unchanged he anchored the pioneer
against a valve and let himself into
the curving corridor he dragged
himself out of the heavy suit-and fell
asleep beside it on the floor

he woke with a start and stretched
his aching body moving heav-
ily still weary he bathed and shaved
the yellow stubble from his face and
stumbled at last into the wide white-
tiled kitchen where he had so often
sat with worth and drumm and pat

  blackness hung outside the small
round ports

  at first as he listlessly put water
and coffee into a percolator and looked
in the refrigerator for a slice of frozen
ham there seemed nothing strange
about the blackness then he realized
that the sun should have been shining

  icy dread spurred him to a port
shading its reflecting surface from the
lights within he could see a dying
glow of red without faintly it out-
lined the ragged peaks of arzachel
he looked for the earth and the sun
beyond but he could see only a wall
of dull red haze faintly touched here
and there with the nebulas own omi-
nous green

  this he knew was the final night

  he tried to shrug and limped back
to his bubbling coffee it didnt mat-
ter the end might as well come to-
day as tomorrow for there was no
longer any hope for earth and man

  cartwright had thought that he was
hungry but the frying ham spent its
aroma unnoticed it crackled and
sputtered as he stood staring at the
chair that had been pat waylands at


startling stories

last before he moved the grease burst
into flame

  he discovered it suddenly and
poured water into the blazing pan and
moved automatically about the busi-
ness of cooking another piece and a
sort of courage came back to him as
he ate

  it was not hope for there was no
longer any hope it was merely the
rising up in him of something strong-
er than himself it was the primal
drive of race-preservation

  the thing he must do was obvious
the purpose came to him of itself he
examined it with a curious detach-
ment he saw that the odds were a
million to one against it but even
that realization did not stay him

  in one of the shops in the citadel
he found welding equipment he put
on the pressure-suit again and went
out into the thickening darkness that
had fallen upon the moon

  his first task was to remove the out-
er valve of one of the air-locks from
its hinges the earth-weight of the
massive steel door was five hundred
pounds but heaving and pushing
and straining he got it in place at last
on top of the pioneer over that ragged
hole

  it took him several hours to weld it
in place even then it was a ragged
and unsightly job but it would hold
air he knew-until the next meteor
struck at last it was done he
made another hasty meal and took off
again for earth

  the stark simplicity of his purpose
almost appalled him

  the pioneer itself must be the ark
of space

ith two or three persons
aboard he thought it might
reach that rift in the nebula were vega
had been visible and so come to safety
to whatever safety at least that
might exist for the survivors of a lost
world wandering without hope or
destination

  he would first land again in antarc-
tica beside the abandoned ark of
space he would load the pioneer
from the supplies and the stacks of
golden fuel there then he would

look for a son and a daughter of
utopia-

  his fevered thoughts went back
again to pat wayland if some mira-
cle should discover her her platinum-
haired loveliness beside him would
turn this from a bitterly hopeless task
into a splendid adventure

  he shrugged and pushed away the
dream after all he had no hope of
finding pat and even if he did she
would have something to say about be-
coming the mother of futurity he
could hear the malicious sweetness of
her voice

  so noble of you jay but lets play
anagrams

  the earth had been invisible lost in
the nebula when he took off from the
moon he set his course by making
observations on the receding moon
for so short a crossing that should be
accurate enough-unless he ran into
another dead pocket and lost his ori-
entation 

  presently the dull crimson disk of
the moon vanished behind him the
sun made only a dull indefinite blur
and still the earth had not appeared
suddenly the geodes faltered and a
cold numbness seized him

  but with deft quick hands on the
controls he brought the ship safely
past before the erratic forces of the
dead pocket had disturbed the instru-
ments he set it back upon the course
and at last the earth came into view

  an earth queerly changed

  somehow it had taken on a strange
pearly lusture the atmosphere
seemed covered with a strange shining
envelope the continents and the
white blots of cloud were hidden
everywhere save at the center of the
disk where he could faintly distin-
guish the outline of africa

  a cold dread gripped him was
that queer film some condensation in
the atmosphere from the gases of the
nebula was it perhaps a toxic vapor
that already had annihilated the luck-
less race

  another amazing change took place
as he watched two tufts of flame
burst out from the poles of that opa-
lescent globe a bright living green
-a hue that was oddly familiar-they
the fortress of utopia



sprayed out like the lines of force
from the poles of a bar magnet

  the milky envelope had been fright-
ening this was the sheer incredible
before he could make even an effort
to comprehend it he saw the great
meteor

  a vast rock ragged and dark came
plunging through the greenish-black
streamers of the nebula a dazzling
trail of pale-blue luminescence was
left behind it

  for an instant cartwright thought
that it would strike the pioneer one
hand tensed on the pilot rod in a des-
perate effort to fling the little ship
aside the other came up in an au-
tomatic useless gesture to shield his
face

in an instant however he realized
his mistake that hurtling mass
was far larger and more distant than
had been his first dazed impression-
otherwise its terrific velocity would
have made it quite invisible

  staring in a paralysis of dread he
saw that it was moving apparently to-
ward the earth its mass he knew
must be countless millions of tons
the violence of its impact if it struck
might shatter a whole continent

  what if it did numb with horror
he made a little apathetic shrug
when the world was doomed what
mattered a few days more or less

  if there were any survivors when
he landed with the pioneer-

 his thoughts were frozen stiff
with wonderment he stared at that
strangely altered planet and then back
at his instruments he shook his be-
wildered head made hurried observa-
tions and frantic calculations

  then he shouted

 moving if im not crazy - the
earth is moving-out of its orbit
and that meteor is going to miss it

  what could have happened to move
the planet no answer was conceiv-
able trembling with a sudden breath-
less hope and an equal dread he
changed the course of the pioneer to
follow

  and the little geoflexor plunged
into another dead pocket it was the
greatest that cartwright had struck

for an hour the tiny ship spun help-
less her drive fields refusing to mesh

  at last the geodes thrummed again
cartwright searched eagerly for the
moving earth but it was gone the
nebula had thickened about him even
the vague crimson blur of the sun had
vanished there were only green-
black clouds and the great meteor
with its shining trail

      chapter xxi
      the shining door

the meteor itself however and
the direction of its luminescent
trail restored cartwrights orienta-
tion he knew the course that the in-
explicably moving earth had taken
with reference to the meteor he fol-
lowed

 and suddenly the amazing planet
burst out of a wall of ominous cloud
it was a huge globe of milky light
thrusting brushes of green fire from
its poles with the dust-clouds of the
nebula whipping past at scores of
miles a second he feared that he would
lose it again

  he feared too that its incredible
motion would draw it away from him
but its curving progress remained de-
liberate and the pioneer drew toward
it

  at last at an elevation of eighty
miles cartwright came down into that
opalescent envelope a thin silver
haze surrounded the ship while he
dropped forty miles then it cleared
again and made a silver dome above
him

  he gasped at what he saw below

  he was descending over antarctica
his grimly hopeless plan had been to
land at the abandoned ark of space to
provision and refuel the pioneer
now this motion of the earth-a thing
beyond comprehension-might make
his plan either needless or futile in
any case the stack of golden ingots
for the power tubes was almost ex-
hausted whatever was to come they
had to be replenished-

  but even that purpose was swept


startling stories

from his mind by the wonder of the
thing he now beheld

  the ic-bound convexity of the polar
continent lay beneath him rugged
mountain ranges thrust grim black
summits above endless seas of hum-
mocked fissured ice and all that
frozen desert was illuminated by the
strange pale luminescence of the silver
sky and by an incredible pillar of
weird green flame

  far south of the granite ridge where
the ark of space had been abandoned
full upon the polar plateau itself rose
a vast flat disk-shaped structure it
was a thing cartwrights benumbed
brain reckoned thousands of feet in
diameter and straight up from its
center rose that supernal column of
green fire it was that same mighty
jet of mysterious light that made the
far-spreading brush of fire above the
silver haze

  so cartwright didnt land at the ark
he drove the pioneer straight toward
the base of that shining column he
had to know about this colossal con-
struction and the light above it if it
was the last thing he ever knew

  for this-this mighty incredible
phenomenon - must be what had
moved the earth

  he was afraid but it was a fear com-
pounded of awe all his body was
cold and stiff with apprehension but
an eager hope was burning in him
too   

  he dropped the pioneer upon a gla-
cier slope beyond that cyclopean disk
it was a curving wall of gray metal
it rose straight out of the ice the
top of it he estimated was five hun-
dred feet above him

  his approach had not been chal-
lenged he saw no men nothing was
moving there were no doors on any
openings in that metal wall he wait-
ed anxiously watching through the
ports nothing happened

at last moved by the desire for a
closer examination of the thing
he opened the pioneers valves and
climbed down upon the ice a drum-
ming sound reached him from that
mighty disk it was infinitely deep
it suggested infinite power a rush-

ing like that of a far hurricane came
down from the pillar of flame

  it was far warmer outside the ship
than he had expected this was the
dead of the antarctic winter even
without the greater cold caused by the
interception of sunlight by the nebula
it might normally have been fifty or
eighty below zero actually however
it was not quite freezing little pools
of water were standing on the ice

  that high silver haze cartwright
realized must be radiating heat as
well as light his brain jumped to the
incredible but correct conclusion-
this power could make the planet in-
dependent of the suns radiation

  in awe and bewilderment he walked
bewilderedly toward that mighty gray
wall its great size made it deceptive-
ly near but at last he came to it over
the slippery ice touched it it was
steel he could see the seams where
tremendous plates had been welded
it vibrated faintly to that deep rever-
beration

  there was no opening in it after
a little time cartwright turned to go
back to the pioneer across the weirdly
green-lit ice he was shaking his
head baffled

  hi jay

  for a moment he kept plodding on
his brain not registering that amazing
call then his heart heaved upon him
-pat waylands voice he wheeled
the breath went out of him

  something had happened to a tall
oval section of the steel wall behind
him it was shining with a faint bluish
light it was ghostly transparent
and pat wayland was running out of
it as if it had been no more than a
barrier of smoke

  jay jay her cry was clarion-
like with a sob of joy beneath it

  he caught his breath stumbled to-
ward her his anxious eyes were de-
vouring her she wore strangely cut
garments of some white fur-like stuff
her platinum head was bare and her
blue eyes smiled at him joyously

  pat pat his incredulous eyes
went back to the blue-shining doorway
in the wall of steel he saw little
mart worth standing beyond its
smoky transparency and thought he
the fortress of utopia



glimpsed the bright uniform of cap-
tain drumm and there was a tall
strangely attired figure who looked
curiously like lyman galt he looked
bewilderedly back at the girl

  pat he faltered    this is   
a dream  

  her hand seized his he gripped it
clinging to the warm strong reality of
it and looked anxiously into her white
face she shook her shining head
happily

  it isnt a dream though its all
wonderful enough to be one

  like a sleep walker he looked back
at the glowing smoky oval it was
real pat was real it was all real
and now he found tongue masked his
stormy emotions

  how about that he searched
her face again how did you get
out here pat i may be crazy-but i
thought i saw you come walking
through a solid steel wall

  her laugh was like the chime of a
bell

  so you did jay-and that isnt the
strangest thing you will see

  he held on to her hand this at
least he would not deny himself

  its just one surprising little scien-
tific discovery of the under-men she
explained one of their scientists
was looking for a way to make more
space for them underground he de-
veloped a force-field which polarizes
the electrons two pieces of matter
polarized in different planes are in-
terpenetrable the discovery was not
successful for the original purpose
because the polarization lasts only a
few seconds after the power is turned
off but it does enable men to walk
through walls-or floors

  cartwright started

  so thats how you were taken
pat

  her shining head nodded

 a band of under-men came up
from their tunnels through a polar-
ized section of the floor they had
been coming every night to observe
the nebula they simply took the op-
portunity to avail themselves of the
services of one of the famous four
she laughed again he had never
heard her laugh like that before

  these under-men he demanded
who-

  they are the children of the rene-
gades she told him their leader
kran grekko says that he is the
great-great-great-grandson of silver
skull-do you see an amazing likeness
to lyman galt

  galt yes

cartwrights eyes flashed to
the fading oval of the strange
door and the girl nodded her blue
eyes turned serious

  it seems there was something
wrong with our great plan jay our
utopia failed it was the renegades
whom we tried to destroy who made
the real advance because i suppose
they had to advance in order to sur-
vive at all now it is they who have
saved the earth

  they are really moving it cart-
wright gestured dazedly at the great
disk and the pillar of shining green
above with-this

  pat wayland nodded smiling at
him a little tremulously

  they are the earth is now a
ship if this disk were smaller you
would recognize it as a geode-element
it differs only in size from the one of

the geodes on the pioneer there is
another like it moored at the north
pole all the planet is meshed in
their geoflexion field

  the earth-a ship

  cartwrights amazed eyes lifted to
the silver vault above

  it is a ship the girl said softly
the under-men have developed an
iron-cathode power tube that is many
times more efficient than anything we
had and their deeper tunnels have
found fuel enough

  her white arm lifted

  that silvery gas floating above the
atmosphere prevents too rapid radia-
tion of heat it is excited to fluores-
cence by the cosmic rays so
wherever we voyage in space well
have heat and light

  there will be no days or nights of
course the climate over all the
planet will be mild and comfortable
an eternal spring worth promises
you see that the ice is already thaw-

ing down here in antarctica

  her blue eyes were shining

 isnt it wonderful jay her
voice had an eager ring the earth
is safe its free now it can cruise
through space from star to star
wherever man shall guide it a new
era has come of knowledge and free-
dom and power men are now the
masters of their environment and not
the slaves

  a sober little hush came into her
voice our job that we planned so
long ago-two hundred and thirty
years ago-is done arent you happy
jay isnt it grand

  suddenly her blue eyes were peer-
ing at him curiously whats the
matter jay arent you glad

  he shook his yellow head with a
dazed little grin

  oh i guess im glad-of course im
glad what i mean is-well im still
sort of confused and tired i dont
know quite what to think but it
looks like everything is going to be
all right theres nothing more to
worry about i guess

  he looked at her slim blond loveli-
ness what about you pat what
are you going to do

  it was a little time before she an-
swered he saw a little wet gleam in
her huge blue eyes and she blinked

  i dont know jay she said slowly
i dont know i have been working
to help save the earth for so long-
putting that first and trying to forget
everything else-so long that nothing
else seems quite real i guess ill find

something-sort of begin over again
somehow

  her soft voice caught

 how-how about you jay

  it wasnt any use cartwright knew
to tell her what he felt but it had
been bottled up in him too long and
now in this dazing moment of vic-
tory no possible rebuff seemed to mat-
ter very much

  it came rushing out of him

  you know i love you pat ive
told you before its probably no use
to say it again and please forgive
me if i hurt you i dont know what
makes you like you are whether you
loved galt or someone before but-
well i just cant help loving you

  he stopped then staring at her
he had expected one of her old ma-
licious wise-cracks but suddenly she
was laughing and then he saw that
she was crying and then he didnt
know which she was doing

 words filtered through her pa-
roxysms

 once i thought i loved lyman
that was why i first joined his
utopia corporation but that left no
time no room for anything the ap-
proach of the holocaust it seemed to
me made all love madness im afraid
i showed my bitterness and anger but
now-

  cartwright had never understood
pat wayland

 now he was astonished when she
flung her arms around him and kissed
him eagerly but not too astonished
to make the fitting response

the impossible

   a guest editorial
   ey ralph milne farley ma

                 famous scientifiction author

fhe british patent office used to have a
practice of rejecting all patent applications
which involved perpetual motion perpetual
motion was inherently impossible they said
but finally an applicant who claimed to have
invented perpetual motion ap-
pealed and carried his case clear to
the house of lords

  the lords overruled the patent
office in a learned opinion bris-
tling with instances of things which
scientists had unanimously de-
clared impossible but which later
had come to pass so the lords
held that each patent involving
perpetual motion must be consid-
ered on its own individual merits
precisely like a patent in any other
field

  when the steam locomotive was
first invented scientists shook their
heads and prophesied that human
beings could not travel at a speed
of  mph and live

   with the exception of the lamented professor
langley scientists were agreed that man would
never fly

  yet even when confronted with these in-
stances of mis-prophecy the scientists and
pseudo-scientists of today ponderously explain
that although their ilk were wrong before nev-
ertheless perpetual motion and time traveling
are in quite a different category-that it can
be proved mathematically that these things
really are impossible

  perpetual motion violates the law of conser-
vation of energy they say who enacted that
law laws of nature so-called are not laws
they are merely generalizations from observed
phenomena always open to the discovery of ex-
ceptions

  time-traveling violates the prin-
ciple that you cant have a time-
rate-of-change of time they say
why not you can have a space-
rate-of-change of space dydx
ah but they dogmatically reply
there are three space dimensions
and only one time quite so but
a space-rate-of-change of space is
possible along a one-dimensional
line dxjdx so why not dtjdt

  gentlemen of science we the au-
thors of science-fiction are one
jump ahead of you hollands sub-
marine patent was declared invalid
as anticipated by jules vernes
novel the u s patent office re-
jected an automatic radio-relay on
the strength of a gadget in one of my radio
man stories and when you yourselves finally
perfect perpetual motion time travel thinking
robots etc it will again be found that we have
beaten you to it

  so dont be too dogmatic about your un-
breakable laws of nature nothing is im-
possible

known author of science-fiction is the holder of a num-
ber of patents and is lecturer in physics at mar-

      ow listen sergeant ive got
some information that you
 really ought to get i guess
id be better off if i kept my mouth
shut but-well this doctor stoner
youre holding is innocent he didnt
murder those three freaks they-
just died

   theres a lot to this case that you
dont understand sergeant doc
stoner and i are the only ones who
know the inside story and he wont
talk

  who me my names tom dor ion
age thirty-two im a freak-hunter for
the empire circus combine-you
know the outfit that bought out ring-
ling and barnum   

  oh-i just keep hunting up freaks
for the shows whenever the boss gets
a lead on something new and big for
the midways he sends me out to sign
em up between times i keep roving
scouting for material

where do i cut in on this case
thats what i want to tell you its a
long story and im not much of a hand

they introduced themselves as visitors from the
forty-third century ad


three wise men	

at talking but here goes about two
months back id just returned from
borneo with a two-headed snake and a
dyak boy with a pair of singing parra-
keets when the big boss-thats joe
wallace-called me into his office i
could see right off that he didnt feel
like patting me on the back and hand-
ing me a cigar and suddenlike he
jammed a newspaper into my hand and
pointed to a headline

  look he yelped somewhere out
on long island are three freaks-lit-
tle guys with big heads-and i want
them for my shows theyre gettin a
swell build-up an youre gonna sign
em-or else

  i didnt like that or else but i
didnt say so i just looked at the ar-
ticle maybe you read it too ser-
geant-most everybody did i guess
anyway i have the clipping here and
if you dont mind ill sort of skim over
em just to refresh your memory

three wise men come out
of future

ambassadors from tomorrow appear at
long island house party

scientists astounded

  long island city july -a house party
at the country estate of oliver p mawson
millionaire autcjhobile manufacturer came
to an abrupt and thrilling termination last
night with the appearance of three uninvited
guests with more than two hundred famous
people present including the leading figures
in artistic scientific and financial circles
the party reached its height at about 
am when a terrific explosion shook the
sumptuous mawson mansion shouts were
heard from the lawn outside and excited
guests streamed into the night

  a startling spectacle greeted them the
entire western sky was lit up by a strange
greenish light rising from a little hill a hun-
dred yards away and in that unearthly
glow they saw a huge polished metal cylin-
der sprawled on the hillside its lower end
twisted and torn by the explosion which
had gouged and blasted the hilltop uproot-
ing several young trees

  as the guests reached the hill they heard
sounds within the metal cylinder and one
after another three strange small men
crawled out almost identical in appearance
they were little more than four feet in
height and their bodies covered only by
white sleeveless shirts of some soft silky
material and flaring white shorts seemed
amazingly thin and fragile though tanned a

 olden brown their heads completely
aid were enormous being fully twice the
size of normal human heads and their
faces thin almost to the point of emaciation
were old and wrinkled with deeply shunken
eyes and thin indrawn lips the whole some-
how grotesquely out of proportion with their
huge heads

scientist interviewed

  in an interview roger st john noted as-
stronomer and writer stated i never saw
a more startling spectacle that green glow
which seemed to emanate from the very
earth of the hilltop cloaked those three little
men with an air of the unearthly it stunned
us there was something almost juvenile in
their faces yet with it was something so in-
credibly ancient that-well it marked them
as creatures of another world-or time

 it seemed almost as though they had
stepped from the pages of a wellsian fan-
tasy-men from the future when one of
them spoke his voice was peculiarly flat and
bore an indescribable accent

  a slight miscalculation lon he said
doubtless due to the changing contour of
the terrestrial surface we should hav
raised our supports two feet higher

  fortunate that our miscalculation had
no more regrettable result than the loss of
our time-drive replied the second little
man dryly

 the third waved a hand toward us and
said in the same flat voice we have audi-
ence comrades and the three walked
slowly down the hillside

come out of future

 after the excited throng escorted the
strange visitors into the great ballroom of
mawson manor and subsided to a point
where intelligent conversation could be car-
ried on the three introduced themselves as
lon st-- ander cw-- and
ken mb-- visitors from the forty-
third century ad or the year  new
era they had come back into the past so
they said to view at first hand what their
history indicated was the first year of the
new era-this very year

  there followed an animated discussion
during which the visitors were dubbed the
three wise men for they revealed a star-
tling knowledge about everything the
effect of this discovery was startling   

hats that sarge    well
okay anyway maybe it gives
you an idea how i felt when i looked
at joe wallace after id finished read-
ing the thing i opened my mouth-

 dont say it dorion he snapped
im dumb enough to give you credit
for having a little brains-an if you
try to tell me youre failin for this


startling stories

time-travelin bunk im liable to get
sore look you scram over to that
mawson guys joint an stay there till
things break sooner or later the bot-
tomll fall outa the story these three
big-headed freaks are dishing up an
when it does i want you there to sign
em

  i didnt waste much time getting out
to mawsons little fifty-acre estate on
long island but getting inside was
something else a faked reporters
card didnt work neither did a black
bag a pair of spectacles and a doctors
front so-well i got in but i was
glad there didnt happen to be any po-
lice around

  after i brushed the dust off my
soup-and-fish there wasnt anyone
could tell me from the other guests
when i first saw those three little men
-well it was an experience the pa-
pers hadnt stretched things a bit
boy i figured if joe wallace could
get them we sure had three world-
beaters on our hands

  this guy mawson had sort of set
himself up as proud father and legal
guardian of the three-and let me tell
you he did things right some of
those feeds of his would set you back
twenty bucks in a manhattan hash
house

  the second day mawson arranged
an interview with the press never
saw such a mob of reporters before or
since the scientists were there and
-well when the lid blew off and the
physics astronomy higher mathemat-
ics biology and all the rest of that
bunk started flying around sort of
casual-like the three wise men got
to telling the scientific big shots where
to head in those little guys knew
everything

  there was one egg there a german
scientist who thought he was pretty
hot stuff seems hed written a book
called atoms protons and posi-
trons the building blocks of the uni-
verse the way he looked at it now
there was nothing more to be said he
mentioned his work and ander-he
was the only one of the three with a
sense of humor-started spouting a
chapter of the book word for word
just sat there looking at nothing while

the syllables rolled out in that flat
hollow voice

  i could see the dutchman swelling
up like a balloon-not thinking of the
brains this little man had but of how
important his work was to be remem-
bered two thousand years in the fu-
ture then ander said sort of soft
and gentle

  we preserve some of the more ab-
surd of the ancient writings as enter-
tainment for the children a counter-
part i should say of your fairy tales
when the reporters left at the end
of three or four hojtrs the three wise
men were headra for the biggest
splash of publicity that ever hit any-
body i still remember some of those
headlines

the three wise men explain
relativity to einstein

  super-mentals baffle scientists

future men ride rough shod over
earths best minds

  there were pictures by the dozens
pictures of the three pictures of their
machine-what was left of it after the
souvenir hunters got through with it

funny but there was one big an-
gle that everybodyd overlooked
at first but when it struck it socked
about forty million people all at once
if these little birds had come out of
the future they must know some his-
tory that hadnt happened as yet and
you know sarge theres nothing a
man wouldnt give to know whats go-
ing to break tomorrow or the next day
think how swell it would be for a guy
playing the market and these three
with their super memories-well it
looked like a natural

  about forty million phone calls
telegrams and letters struck mawson
manor at the same time could the
three wise men tell the history of
the future they could and would

  oliver p mawson arranged it hes
a big fat man about six-feet-two with
round red cheeks like a pair of apples
and eyes as bright as two blue marbles
-and hes just as hard worked his
way up from a laborer in an auto plant
three wise men



to become one of the richest men in
the country

  with mawson pulling the strings
the three wise men were scheduled
for a big television broadcast on a
world hook-up that was just a few
months before the presidential elec-
tion and the three crowded the can-
didates right off the air waves

  as for the broadcast-well every-
body had heard of the three had read
what they had said and now they
could see them and hear them and
they said plenty they told of the big
yellow war of seventy years from now
they told    but i guess you heard
the broadcast about this new era
business and this year being the first
of the new era the beginning of a
slow unbroken march toward genuine
civilization and how they said a man
by the name of doctor michel stoner
was the one to take the first big step
forward michel stoner the next
president of the united states they
said

  let me tell you sarge that rocked
the great american public back on
their heels who was doctor michel
stoner nobodyd ever heard of him
yet the three said he was going to be
the next president

 the papers-you remember sarge
-played it up big michel stoner the
man of destiny who was he where
was he

  so they started hunting for michel
stoner md some reporter found out
that about twenty-five years ago hed
practiced medicine in a little pennsyl-
vania town and that hed dropped that
to take over a professors chair in a
college so small they didnt even have
a paid football team-and that was all
hed simply disappeared

  the search went on until at last they
found him in a little four-room cabin
in the massachusetts hills about a hun-
dred miles from nowhere didnt even
have a radio hadnt seen a newspaper
in two months nobody around there
knew anything about him except that
about once every three months or so
he drove out of the hills in a dilapi-
dated flivver to buy some gasoline
food and books the books they re-
membered most cause there was al-

ways a lot of them waiting in the post
office marked m stoner general de-
livery i think it was through the pub-
lishers he was finally located

 well if nobody knew anything
about him at first it didnt take them
long to find out oliver p himself
drove up there in a platinum plated
rolls and carried him back to mawson
manor and of course there was an-
other big world broadcast with maw-
son the master of ceremonies the
three wise men were there with bells
on and stoner-well sarge if you
saw and heard that broadcast youll
have to admit he made some impres-
sion

 dont care if you do have him
behind the bars i told you hes
innocent-and im here to prove it to
you

  i have another clipping   

  now wait a minute sarge just this
one thisll be the last one ill read
you see i make scrap books of the
things im interested in-helps me
keep a record    listen

world broadcast startles
vast audience

dr michel stoner makes amazing
impression

will run for office

  new york city aug -dr michel
stoner the recluse from the massachusetts
hills will be an independent candidate in the
forthcoming presidential election he re-
vealed that last night after a world televi-
sion broadcast in which he proved to be one
of the most impressive figures ever to reach
the telescreens despite his earlier decision
to leave politics to others dr stoner found
the american public so overwhelmingly in-
sistent on his running for office that he felt
impelled to yield to their demands

  dr stoner faced an audience burning with
curiosity to see the man mentioned by the
three wise men as the first president of
the new era of average height and rather
slender in build he is at once a figure of
quiet power impressive dignity and mag-
netic personality his head is crowned
with a mass of snow white hair and his
voice-never has such a resonant voice
borne so much of wisdom on the one hand
and beauty of diction on the other in dr
michel stoner america has discovered a
genius

for the past twenty years doctor stoner
has been engaged in the writing of a vol-


startling stories

uminous and comprehensive work tenta-
tively entitled man and the way of man
in his manuscript already more than two
million words in length doctor stoner has
discussed in full detail the development of
man since the dawn of reason up to the
present and into the future if the numer-
ous quotations from his work are an indica-
tion he possesses a rare insight into human
behavior and character

new era dawning

  man he said has reached the threshold
of vast new truths the doors of knowledge
are swinging aside old thoughts and meth-
ods of thinking are passing away displaced
by a newer more rational consciousness
long-standing fears disorders and supersti-
tions are yielding to an imposing array of
new knowledge like a tidal wave sweeping
everything before it and man rides like
foam on its crest

  a new era is dawning a new age when
all mankind will be welded into one vast
spiritual whole one tremendous world com-
munity in which the term war will have no
meaning someone with cosmic understand-
ing someone in whom the world conscious-
ness has awakened into fulness of life will
lead you but it should be someone wiser far
than i-someone whose name i do not
know

  yeah sarge i suppose that is
enough seems like everybody else
thought so too for it was only about
ten minutes after he left the air that
demands started pouring in for him to
run for president

  what a howl went up in certain
quarters when the doc started his
campaign after all this guys
speeches were the kind that got prac-
tically anything they asked for and
with the three wise men on his side
it looked like a sure thing for the dark
horse the democrats kicked because
they figured they had had the thing in
the bag and the republicans kicked
because they thought-or at least
hoped-that this time theyd be able
to upset the mule

  but the howls were only straws in a
cyclone no one paid much attention
to the other candidates a blind man
could see that stoner was slated to go
in with the biggest majority in his-
tory what was the use in voting
against a man who future records
showed had been elected and with
the three for him and mawsons mil-
lions behind him-well sarge it was
some set-up

 didnt see much of the three lit-
tle big-shots those days nor much
of stoner or mawson either they
still made the big long island mansion
their headquarters but they were too
busy to spend much time with a flock
of perpetual house guests i figure
theyd have given us our walking pa-
pers if it hadnt been for the scientists
but they made company for the three
and good copy for the tabloids any-
way i was in and enjoying it

  but after awhile my conscience
started working i remembered joe
wallace and here i was swimming
and playing tennis with a pair of swell
dames eating so much that id put on
an average of two pounds a week and
-well i decided to get busy

  it took about a week for me to get
the hang of the place then one night
when i was playing detective i stum-
bled on something big thered been
some big doings in philadelphia-
stoner given the keys to the burg a
big parade speeches and everything
that went with it theyd come back
to mawson manor all played out

  i was sliding along one of those big
corridors when i heard voices maw-
sons bark stoners smooth deep bari-
tone and the flat creaking voices of
the three and they didnt sound like
they were chinning just to pass the
time away

  get this stoner i heard mawson
say and his words sort of cut like a
knife youre not backing out you
couldnt even if id let you and im
not letting you see theres too much
involved in this for things to topple
now so forget it

  i cant forget it stoner said as
solemn as a funeral im tired of the
whole thing i wish youd never found

     

me

  then one of the three spoke-i
think it was lon

  were tired too and he certainly
sounded tired like a guy with insom-
nia who hadnt slept for months

  tired mawsons voice cracked
then go to bed-get some sleep to-
morrow youll be over this nonsense
ive got enough to worry about with-
out this got another threatening let-

startling stories

ter today-this one i think from the
ernisto mob the politicians are back
of em im certain but i cant prove it
the police-they cant do a damn
thing and whered we be if the three
wise men were kidnaped

  i heard a door slam and i beat it
down the hall-fast

  i didnt sleep so well that night
what id heard took heavy thinking
stoner was tired of the whole thing
tired of what of running for presi-
dent or of a big fake then i
thought of those strange big-headed
little men with their young eyes and
old voices and i didnt know what to
think    and this talk of kidnaping
-there hadnt been even a whisper
about it in the papers big things were
starting to break and i could only
wait

  i dragged through the next two days
in a sort of fog waiting for something
to happen and when i woke up on
the morning of the third day it had
happened all right-cracked wide
open

the three wise men kid-
naped

  the tabloids screamed it in the big-
gest headlines since the lindbergh
case the telescreens sort of snapped
or roared it at a wholesale rate id
been half expecting it yet it knocked
the wind out of me

  it seemed doctor stoner and the
three had been returning late from a
trip to the studios mawson had been
delayed on a lonely stretch of road
theyd run out of gas-how was a mys-
tery cause the gauge registered
full mustve been tampered with
the chauffeur had walked back toward
the last gas station theyd passed and
when hed come back car wise men
and presidential candidate had disap-
peared

but you know all that sarge bet-
ter than i do-and you know how
they found stoner the next day lying
in the back of the car as sick as a dog
and the smell of chloroform strong
enough to choke an elephant he told
how a big sedan had pulled up and

four men with tommy-guns had or-
dered the three into their machine
and had doped him that was all he
knew till the cops found him and the
mileage gauge had been smashed   

  oh i know its all old stuff to you
but ive got to tell this in my own way
i dont want to skip anything impor-
tant see

  well in mawson manor things re-
sembled a first-class madhouse the
big boss tore things wide open doc-
tor stoner was confined to his room
almost prostrated by shock and then
the police came in droves and sort of
suddenlike i got the idea that it was
time for tom dorion to scram i was
the uninvited guest and id have a
tough time talking myself out of this
spot if the police caught up with me

  in town i hung around my room
waiting to see what would happen
next there wasnt much-just the de-
livery of that first ransom note de-
manding one million dollars for each
of the three letters clipped out of
newspapers and pasted on a sheet of
bond paper by a guy wearing gloves
no fingerprints-no nothing

  you picked up a lot of mobsters that
first week didnt you sarge and you
looked for a house guest who had dis-
appeared on the day after the kidnap-
ing a guy nobody seemed to know
much about-only you couldnt find
him and after a little while you
found out you hadnt accomplished
anything the papers made it hot for
the police commissioner and he made
it hot for everybody under him you
sweated a flock of mobsters-and it
didnt mean a thing

  it was about that time that i decided
id better get busy joe wallace had
told me to stick with the three wise
men till id signed em up for his
shows and here id let em be kid-
naped under my very nose i sort of
thought things over and i got a
hunch you see i couldnt get that lit-
tle conversation between mawson
stoner and the three out of my dome
so i hired a flivver and headed for the
massachusetts hills

  that little cabin of michel stoners
wasnt the easiest place in the world to
find but i found it i guess i was
three wise men



about two blocks from the place when
i parked the rattling wreck i was driv-
ing and sort of crept up toward the
joint it was a nifty little hideaway

  it took me about a half an hour to
cover a couple hundred yards i didnt
figure there was much danger if my
hunch was right but i couldnt be
sure so i didnt take any chances if
those hardboiled boys with the hair
grease and the tommy-guns were
mixed up in this-well it might not
be so healthy for tom dorion

  but i finally got there and sort of
eased my eyes up over a window sill
there they were-the three wise
men and nobody else it took me just
about one second to get around to the
door let me tell you sarge i felt
good this was a break here was my
chance if i didnt get their names on
some kind of a contract it wouldnt
be my fault

hen i knocked on the door
and one of them answered
come in some of the pep went out
of me honest sarge i never heard
anything as-as lifeless as that voice
so flat and dull almost like i was
hearing the dead talking if you get
what i mean

  there they were sprawled out
across a cot bed hardly moving they
always were queer-looking birds but
now it seemed like they were centuries
old as though they were shrinking
drying up before my eyes

  good morning gentlemen i said
cheery-like thought id stop in an
say hello

  anders answered and he didnt even
move his head we are glad you
came we are so-tired we have
lived beyond our-allotted span soon
we shall die and it is not good to die
alone

  if you dont think that just about
floored me sarge youre crazy there
i was with the best attraction that ever
hit the show game practically in the
palm of my hand and they were
dying for a second i didnt say a
word just stared from one to another
i still remember half seeing the rest
of the room-a little stove with an
empty frying pan on it and a coffee

percolator rows and rows of books

  lon pulled himself up on one elbow
there can be no mistake he whis-
pered and thats all it was a hoarse
whisper we know we have but little
time in this life that is why we left
doctor-doctor stoner arranged it-
though he did not realize-how it was
with us we would like to see him be-
fore-we die

  ken the third little man sat up and
i could see it took a terrific effort his
eyes burned out at me like two hot
coals out of two hollow pits coals that
were burning to ashes

  we are old-so terribly old he
croaked yet we are so-young and
the end is close a thin hand pointed
toward the desk there in the upper
drawer on that side is a little book
get it

  in a sort of trance i went over to the
desk i found the book

 that explains things-which
should be known and ken slumped
back on the bed

  look i said isnt there some-
thing i can do my thoughts were
going around in circles but i felt i
had to do something

  ander moved his head from side to
side no one can help us we know
but you can get doctor stoner to-
come here-before we pass on there
may be time-if he hurries

  i sort of slid toward the door
okay okay ill rush i said ill
get him just hang on

  the next thing i knew i was hot-
footing it up the winding road toward
the flivver and let me tell you i sent
that old can rolling like she never
rolled before id passed through a
little town about fifteen miles back
and i headed that way with the accel-
erator jammed against the floor-board

  i guess i reached the place in about
twenty minutes though it seemed like
hours but i got there finally and i
put in a long distance call for the
mawson estate a cop answered i
think it didnt take him long to get
doc stoner on the wire when i bel-
lowed it was a matter of life or death

i spilled the story to stoner in a
few words but he didnt even let


startling stories

me finish i heard a sort of choking
cry then i heard the receiver crash on
the hook i got out of there in a hurry
i didnt want to be around when the
fireworks started

  you know what happened better
than i do stoner tearing out of the
mansion like a lunatic grabbing that
big rolls royce of mawsons and roar-
ing away before anyone could even
think of stopping him

  nobody but stoner knows what hap-
pened up to the time the cops arrived
about an hour behind him i have a
good idea but its only an idea any-
way when the police got there as you
know sarge they found the doctor
sitting on a stump in the weed-grown
garden behind the cabin and the
cabin-it was half burned down by
that time a little later there were
only smoking ashes

  and doctor stoner just sat there
and stared and hed only say in a
sort of dull dry voice

  theyre dead and thats their fu-
neral pyre no one will ever know

  but he didnt kill em sarge i tell
you hes innocent they just died

  heres how i dope it out sarge
oliver p mawson was behind the
whole thing you ought to be able to
see that yourself with my telling you
about that argument i heard he got
the big idea when he stumbled across
stoners cabin while driving through
the hills up there those three little
guys with their big heads must have
started his imagination working

  huh sure they were there all the
time dont tell me you fell for that
time-traveling bunk mawson staged
the whole thing ill bet when you
check on it youll find he had the
time-machine built in his automobile
factories and of course since he
couldnt very well fake a time-travel-
ing engine he had to have that ex-
plosion to destroy it it was good
publicity stuff too made a swell
spectacle with a little chemical of
some sort spilled on the ground

  it was power he wanted power
he had so much money he couldnt
keep track of it and that could buy
quite a bit of power-but not enough
hed been a little guy who had worked

himself up from nowhere and it had
gone to his head he wanted to be
dictator of america-and he almost
got what he was after

 sure with these fake men from
the future he planned to have stoner
elected to the presidency with him-
self of course the power behind the
throne and a little later on with
those same three wise men paving
the way hed take over the control of
the government it was a perfect set-
up only something bigger than
oliver p stepped in

 whered the three come from
thats where that little black book
comes in-my ace in the hole thats
what will save michel stoner from the
chair or the bug-house ive got it
here its stoners diary with a daily
record covering the last twenty years

  of course ill give it to you sarge
-but you cant read shorthand can
you i can listen to this-the first
entry that interests us years back

  march   ann is dead it was too
much for her god forgive me but i did all
a man could do she was always so frail
and those endless hours of travail were more
than she could bear what will i do i can
hardly see the page before me and those
three mites theyre such pitiful little things
their heads are enormous victims of hy-
drocephalus obviously i must save them-
or her death will be completely futile

ive looked up that word hydro-
cephalus sarge it means water
on the brain heres what a guy
named blakeslee says about it a lot
of its greek to me but youll get the
general idea

  hydrocephalus fluid effusion within the
cranium giving rise to a more or less uni-
form stretching of the cranial bones the
sutures are obviously stretched asunder ac-
companied by extreme enlargement of the
forehead frequently the eyes will appear
misplaced sometimes they look very much
deeper set than normal in other cases they
look as though they are depressed as a re-
sult of the downward pressure exerted by
the excess fluid upon the roof of the orbits
major degrees of hydrocephalus cause such
extreme enlargement of the head coupled
with such thinning of the bones and stretch-
ing of the sutures that the diagnosis is al-
most unmistakable   

  heres the next important entry
three wise men



  the three boya are still alive though
that they can live at all with such inadequate
treatment is a miracle i have only canned
milk and a prepared baby food and its a
poor substitute for mothers milk i buried
ann eut in the garden beside the stump
where she liked to sit there was nothing
else to do i cant leave my three sons
while life remains in their little bodies ive
decided to try the glandular treatment advo-
cated by gardner for the hydrocephalic con-
dition

  theres no use reading the entries
for the next few weeks sarge its
touch and go for the three boys but
heres the entry for april nd

  the danger for andrew alonzo and ken-
neth is past they seem almost normal now
though theyll always have abnormally large
heads i hope their minds are not affected
a definite possibility since theirs was such
a severe case i left them alone for the first
time today while i drove into town for some
much needed supplies

  it goes on that way sarge for about
seven years then you begin to see
doc stoner starting to get sort of wor-
ried somethings wrong with his
boys finally he writes this

  may   lord what a blunder im
a disgrace to the medical profession to
think that this could have happened to my
own sons ive noticed a strangeness for
quite some time past and at last i know
what it is progeria a glandular ailment
so obscure that perhaps only a half dozen
cases have been recorded the indications
are almost unmistakable im afraid-no
certain-that this condition is the result of
my treatment for the hydrocephalus i know
now that my boys will never be normal at
least physically mentally they seem far
above average andrew is the most brilliant
though all three have truly amazing mem-
ories already they have read and memo-
rized every book in my library ill have to

buy more books perhaps they may develop
into brilliant scientists or writers

  i looked that word progeria up
too sarge and what a time i had
heres the little information i got

  progeria is primary spontaneous infant-
ism mingled with premature senility hence
with shortness of stature and other indica-
tions of infantilism there are baldness
emaciation arterial sclerosis and general
decrepitude the ear lobule is absent the
nasal cartilages are conspicuous and the fin-
gers nodose owing to the prominence of the
epiphyses death from angina pectoris or
other senile disease usually ensues at eight-
een or earlier

  theres a lot there that i dont
understand sarge but i do know this
the three wise men were freaks
built up by those two diseases they
looked like men from the future-or
at least like some writers say theyll
look mawson saw their possibilities
talked stoner into showing them off-
after all stoner was probably proud
of their brains-and got the doctor to
go into the thing himself when he
saw what it was leading to he tried
to back out but mawson wouldnt let
him he faked the kidnaping to upset
mawsons plans

  the three boys old men at eighteen
died of old age and stoner all
broken up because his sons were dead
and probably blaming himself burned
their bodies with the cabin to let them
keep the little glory that was theirs

  ive spoiled that by telling you this
but anyway ive saved him from the
chair

  heres the diary sarge theres a
lot more dope in it i guess id better
report back to joe wallace
thumbnail sketches of great mien and achievements

by wort weisinger

the world moves on

the vast soundproof room was as silent as a vault its main piece of
     furniture was a long oaken table on it a pair of slender crooked can-
     dles flickered eerily casting weird shadows on the walls

  around the table sat six masked men behind the black masks a dozen
gleaming eyes blazed angrily the six pairs of eyes had a common human tar-
get-the nervous bearded astronomer standing before them

  the seventh man galileo de galilei stared apprehensively into the tapering
flame of one of the candles as the blue-white tongue licked and writhed in a
dance of light the bearded astronomer   	t	-----

seemed to see an image form there a tall
defiant figure resolved itself into view it
was a human being lashed to the stake his
captors thin-lipped cruel stood by impas-
sively heaping fuel to the fire savagely the
roaring flames enveloped their victim in a
fiery shroud    and soon the corpse was
as charred as the wooden stake to which it
had been fettered

  galileo mopped his feverish brow and
stared hopelessly about the great room as
he strove to forget the vivid picture recalled
to his mind so they had burned giordane
bruno an astronomer before him at the
stake for bruno had dared to teach the
heretic theory that the earth is not immov-
ably fixed in the center of the universe that
the earth was not the big shot of the solar
system that belief was contrary to the
teachings of science and most important
it refuted the bible so the law had decreed
that bruno the free-thinker must bum

  galileos eyes shifted pleadingly over the
faces of the masked men surrounding the
table he encountered only blank stony
stares still not a word had been uttered
by anyone

  galileo bit his lip if they had burned
bruno at the stake for daring to tell the
truth    such a little bit of the truth   
what would happen to him his discoveries
revolutionized all existing concepts of
astronomy they proved to the world that
the universe was vast cluttered with count-
less stars and planets and satellites and the
earth was merely a cosmic drop in the
bucket man-man was nothing-as unim-
portant as a grain of sand in the oceans bed
and if man was nothing-what was the
power of the church that was why they
would destroy him

  galileo shifted the weight of his body

from one foot to the other would that he
had never constructed his telescope ex-
plored the mysteries of the heavens studied
the revolutions of the neighboring planets

  most certainly galileo would unhesitat-
ingly have given up his life rather than have

galileo de galilei

foregone the thrills his magic optical tube
had captured for him the thrill of being
the first man to discover sun spots    the
first man to see saturns rings    jupiters
four largest satellites   

  but galileo lived in the dreaded and dark
days of the inquisition sweet merciful
death he could face swiftly even eagerly
he could die for his principles but how
many men can brave the ghastly unknown
the insidious diabolical tortures of a group


of fanatics expert in wrenching from a hu-
man body its most inner secret its last audi-
ble breath galileo had seen some of the
poor miserable wretches that had survived
the torturers arts not a pretty sight and
now he himself stood before the leaders of
the inquisition awaiting judgment

  galileo de galilei the chief counsellor
addressed him we have examined your
books minutely we have been deeply
shocked by the falsehoods contained there-
in and we have come to the conclusion that
your teachings are vicious blasphemies en-
tirely unsupported by scientific findings

  the masked counsellor paused for a mo-
ment the better to let his dramatic accusa-
tion seep into the fogged brain of his de-
fendant    the defendant who didnt have
a chance

  falsehoods galileo roared back at his
accuser unsupported findings i have
stated that the world revolves about the sun
on its own axis-just as i have seen is the
case with the satellites circling jupiter the
sun does not circle the earth every twenty-
four hours such an immense orbit is ab-
surd

  silence thundered the voice of the
leader you lie and unless you confess
your errors and renounce your writings for
all the world to know- he gestured mean-
ingly in the direction of the adjacent room-
the torture chamber

  galileo shuddered then he sucked in his

breath clenched his fists hed ell them-
the chief counsellor leaned forward di-
vining galileos forthcoming outburst

  think galileo de galilei he warned
not the stake-not the ax-but the tor-
turers    swear by god that your teach-
ings are false that the earth does not move
about the sun and you will go free

  galileo buried his face in his hands he
was trapped slowly hoarsely he began his
denial of a lifetimes work staring wrath-
fully at his inquisitors he told them

  i swear that all my teachings are false
 i beg foregiveness for having deceived
my fellow men    the earth does not
move about the sun   

  a cold superior smile illumined the gaunt
features of the masked mens leader

  you are forgiven galileo he said and
heed well that you do not blaspheme again
galileo stifled an oath half-pivoted about
and faced the wall

 eppur si mouve-none the less
the planet moves he muttered almost in-
audibly his face livid with rage and then
the astronomer bowed mockingly to his
audience and walked into the clean air out-
side

  had they heard him if they had then he
had won if they hadnt hed lost but win
or lose galileo knew that future civilization
would reach a verdict in his favor for the
world moves-on

 sect a fibrous filament of nerve this time
 the right leg of the frog stabbed out in a

laboratory life

the olive-skinned luigi galvani pointed an acid-stained finger at the
metal tray on his laboratory desk a dead dissected frog lay there its
ventral surface neatly split open all the vital organs exposed to view

  professor galvani lifted a scalpel from the machine to his left tapped it against
the wooden desk and addressed his dark-haired companion

  now watch closely signor volta he said confidently i will repeat the
experiment you have read about i know it
sounds incredible bat you will soon see for
yourself

wait one moment interrupted alessan-
dro volta he lifted the tray gingerly care-
fully inspected the base nothing suspicious
there there was no need to examine the
frog it was as dead as the lamb they had
had for dinner

volta shook his head at his smiling italian
colleague all right go ahead he grum-
bled at last begin your experiment

silently professor galvani waved his scal-
pel before his curious associate then he
drought its shining sharp point in contact
with one of the strandlike nerves in the
frogs left leg

instantly the lifeless frogs leg kicked out
twitched convulsively the leg had moved
perceptibly although the frog had been dead
for days

alessandro voltas eyes bulged at the phe-
nomenon as though the same scalpel had
physically stimulated him too he shook his
head totally perplexed

do it with the other leg please he said
incredulously

again the blade swooped down to inter-



alessandro volta
healthy violent kick it was uncanny

i cant understand it volta muttered
pray professor how do you explain this
professor galvani smiled wisely put back
the scalpel on the machine on his left put
an arm about his friends shoulder

  its simple alessandro he explained
electricity exists in the tissues of the dead
frog my scalpel merely touches off that
stored electricity releases it in the form of
energy in the frogs body the electricity
goes through the nerves of the frogs legs
results in a reflex action-a kick

  in other words you believe that the body
of a dead frog contains electricity

  si my friend that is it exactly all
animals carry electricity

  do you know what i think volta asked
rhetorically i think your theory is prepos-
terous electricity can only be produced by
the contact of two different metals that is
a fact of which i am certain you cannot
convince me otherwise

  professor galvani smiled amusedly

  then how do you explain what you have
just seen that was no trick and i assure

jou that the frog was one pretty dead fel-
ow

  volta shrugged his wide shoulders

  that i cannot answer my friend he said
good-naturedly but ill discover the an-
swer-just as sure as this is the year 
alessandro volta left his friends house a
deep problem haunting his energetic mind
the evidence he had seen for himself was
no optical illusion certainly there was no
supernatural explanation there must be
some good scientific reason to explain why
a cold dead frog should be able to kick vig-
orously

  galvanis explanation he immediately dis-
carded galvani was an anatomy professor
who had only recently begun to dabble with
electricity and volta knew from his many
personal experiences that his associates the-
ory was much too far-fetched

  what then was the answer he was baf-
fled it remained a mystery

  the weeks sped by    became months
but volta had not forgotten

 then one day in his own laboratory
volta suddenly realized the solution the
answer to the problem that had been
plaguing him was simple so simple it had
eluded everyones notice even galvanis
the answer was this in recalling the de-

tails of galvanis experiment to mind a
scene he could never forget volta remem-
bered that the professor had picked up the
scalpel used to contact the frogs nerves
from its lodging place-a machine

 that was the one smashing clue volta
needed to shatter galvanis theory into
kmbo if his deductions were right then
galvani was wrong by a light-year but first
he would have to find out more about this
machine   

  back in galvanis laboratory volta beck-
oned his amazed friend to his desk he
pointed to the machine standing beside it

  what kind of machine is this professor
galvani he asked his deep black eyes
sparkling

  why its an electrical machine ive been
using it to make static electricity why do
you ask

  ah volta exclaimed so i am right
your scalpel rests on this machine obvi-
ously the scalpel is electrified with some of
the electricity stored in the machine it is
this electricity transferred to the scalpel
that activates the frogs legs-not the release
of electricity in the frogs body youve
never realized this truth my friend

  galvani frowned started to protest

  wait let us touch your frog with my
scalpel suggested volta and before the
bewildered galvani could protest volta had
raced over to a jar extracted a dead frog
split it in two and applied his scalpel there
was no reaction volta had proved his re-
jection of galvanis theory

  inspired and thrilled by his analytical
abilities volta used his discovery as the
basis toward proving his own theory-that
electricity is produced by metals by con-
necting a series of two different metal discs
copper and zinc separated by a piece of
cloth soaked in sulphuric acid and water he
obtained a weak electric current-the first
man ever to accomplish that feat in such a
manner

  next volta joined a larger series of these
metals and obtained a stronger flow of elec-
tricity volta had invented what was to be
known as the voltaic pile forerunner of
the modern storage battery and all the
result of a pair of twitching frogs legs a
pair of legs that will be remembered as long
as the volt remains a key term in modern
electricity

racing against light

professor albert abraham michelson tried to be calm but
instead he trembled how could one be calm and cool when the most
delicate experiment in the annals of science was about to be attempted
the year was  several years before michelson had startled the scien-
tific world by measuring the velocity of light the fastest element in the uni-
verse to an inconceivably accurate degree he had shuttled a beam of light

back and forth between two mountain tops		 - - -

in california measuring its speed with a sen- velocity of light caused by the earths mo-
sitive instrument the interferometer his tion through free space hendrik lorentz
own invention	the famous european physicist had calcu-

  but that had been childs play compared lated theoretically that this would be no
to what he now attempted he was trying more than  of the actual light-speed
to detect the infinitesimal influence on the and michelson had declared that he could


monished morley liis assistant why
youre shaking all over

  michelson nodded grimly controlling him-
self by nature he was genial smiling but
now he was a tense bundle of nerves the
experiment was started a powerful light
beam was sent through a series of mirrors
mounted on a stone platform floating in a
bath of oily liquid mercury

  a turntable operated by a powerful com-
pressed-air motor periodically swung the
entire apparatus at right angles easily ef-
fortlessly michelson had spent mind-
draining months designing the various parts
with a precision unknown before in the his-
tory of physics

  finally the moment arrived and michel-
sons taut fingers adjusted the eyepiece of
the interferometer twin beams of light
from the mirrors speared into the instru-
ment one went in the direction of earths
orbital motion the other went transversely
to that motion the latter going across
the ether through which earth drifted
should lag a little from the one following
the ether and his interferometer would
then show the difference by the interfer-
ence of bands of light and dark

  michelsons reputation balanced precari-
ously on the results his instrument would
record ail the scientific world waited many
with derisive smiles to see whether the
brash american could accomplish what the
europeans had not even tried-because it
was impossible michelsons soul as well as
his eyes probed the interferometer that day
and he saw-

  nothing

not the slightest interference he tried
again checking every motion every screw
bolt and mirror apparently the apparatus
concluded on page 

measure that effect with his instruments
verifying lorentzs calculations

  michclson was crazy his task was im-
possible that was the opinion of the euro-
pean men of science true michelson had
won their respect by his ingenious method
of clocking the speed of light but now he
was making a fool of himself he had over-
estimated his mechanical technique as those

albert abraham michclson

americans were so prone to do he was try-
ing to play god and command light to stand
still for him as joshua a leader of michel-
sons own race had commanded the sun to
halt an age before

  you must be more calm professor ad-

i talked with god

   yes i did-actually and literally

and as a result of that little talk with god a
strange power came into my life after  years
of horrible dismal sickening failure everything
took on a brighter hue its fascinating to talk
with god and it can be done very easily once
you learn the secret and when you do-well
-there will come into your life the same
dynamic power which came into mine the
shackles of defeat which bound me for years
went a-shimmering-and now--well i own
control of the largest daily newspaper in our
county i own the largest office building in our
city i drive a beautiful cadillac limousine i
own my own home which has a lovely pipe-organ
in it and my family are abundantly provided
for after im gone and all this has been made
possible because one day ten years ago i actu-
ally and literally talked with god

  you too may experience that strange mysti-
cal power which comes from talking with god
and when you do if there is poverty unrest

unhappiness or ill-health in your life well-
this same god-power is able to do for you what
it did for me no matter how useless or helpless
your life seems to be-all this can be changed
for this is not a human power im talking about
-its a god-power and there can be no limita-
tions to the god-power can there of course
not you probably would like to know how you
too may talk with god so that this same power
which brought me these good things might coma
into your life too well-just write a letter or
a post-card to dr frank b robinson dept
- moscow idaho and full particulars of
this strange teaching will be sent to you free
of charge but write now-while you are in tho
mood it only costs one cent to find out and this
might easily be the most profitable one cent you
have ever spent it may sound unbelievable-
but its true or i wouldnt tell you it was-

the first story ever written

a martian
odyssey

 by stanley g weinbaim

author of the black flame dawn of flame etc

dick jarvis stretched himself as lux-
uriously as he could in the cramped
general quarters of the ares

air you can breathe he exulted it
feels as thick as soup after the thin stuff
out there he nodded at the martian land-
scape stretching flat and desolate in the light
of the nearer moon beyond the glass of the
port

the other three stared at him sympatheti-
cally-schatz the engineer leroy the bi-
ologist and harrison the astronomer and
captain of the expedition

dick jarvis was chemist of the famous

hall

of

fame

sistory

  editors note some stories are forgotten
almost as soon as they are printed others
stand the test of time

  because a martian odyssey by stanley s
weinbaum has stood this test we are nominat-
ing it for sc ienti pict ions hall of fame

  in each issue we will nominate-and reprint
-another favorite of the past

  will you vote for your favorite write and
tll us what it is

  we hope in this way to bring a new promi-
nence to the science fiction gems of yesterday
and to perform a real service for the science
fiction devotees of today and tomorrow

crew the ares expedition first human be-
ings to set foot on the mysterious neighbor
of the earth the planet mars this of
course was in the old days less than twenty
years after the mad american doheny per-
fected the atomic blast at the cost of his life
and only a decade after the equally mad
cardozs rode on it to the moon

  they were true pioneers these four of the
arcs except for a half-dozen moon ex-
peditions and the ill-fated de lancey flight
aimed at the seductive orb of venus they
were the first men to feel other gravity than
earths and certainly the first successful
crew to leave the earth-moon system and
they deserved that success when one con-
siders the difficulties and discomforts-the
months spent in acclimatization chambers
back on earth learning to breathe air as ten-
uous as that of mars the challenging of the
void in the tiny rocket driven by the cranky
reaction motors of the twenty-first century
and mostly the facing of an absolutely un-
known world

  jarvis stretched again and fingered the
raw and peeling tip of his frost-bitten nose
he sighed again contentedly

  well exploded harrison abruptly are
we going to hear what happened you set
out all shipshape in an auxiliary rocket we
dont get a peep for ten days and finally
schatz here picks you out of a lunatic ant-
heap with a freak ostrich as your pal spill
it man

 speer queried leroy perplexedly
speel what

 he means spiel explained schatz
soberly it iss to tell

  jarvis met harrisons amused glance with-
out the shadow of a smile

  thats right karl he said in grave
agreement with schatz ich spiel esr he
grunted comfortably and began

  according to orders he said i watched
karl here take off toward the north and
then i got into my flying sweat-box and
headed south i set the two cameras clicking
and buzzed along riding pretty high call-
ing back my position every hour and not
knowing whether you heard me

  i did snapped harrison


by scientifictionis great master

but suddenly things came drilling along-small transparent spheres

    hundred and fifty miles south
continued jarvis imperturbably the
surface changed to a sort of low plateau
nothing but desert and orange-tinted sand
i figured that we were right in our guess
then and this gray plain we dropped on was
really the mare cimmerium which would
make my orange desert the region called
xanthus if i were right i ought to hit an-
other gray plain the mare chronium in an-
other couple of hundred miles and then an-
other orange desert thyle i or ii and so
i did

  schatz verified our position a week and a
half ago grumbled the captain lets get
to the point

 coming remarked jarvis twenty

miles into thyle-believe it or not-i
crossed a canal

  schatz photographed a hundred lets
hear something new i

  and did he also see a city

  twenty of em if you call those heaps
of mud cities

  well observed jarvis from here on
 be telling a few things schatz didnt see
he rubbed his tingling nose and continued
i knew that i had sixteen hours of daylight
at this season so eight hours-eight hundred
miles-from here i decided to turn back
i was still over thyle whether i or ii im
not sure not more than twenty-five miles
into it and right there schatzs pet motor
quit

x dying orb yields its eternal secret


startling stories

  qvit how schatz was solicitous

  the atomatic blast got weak i started
losing altitude right away and suddenly
there i was with a thump right in the middle
of thyle smashed my nose on the window
too he rubbed the injured member rue-
fully

  did you maybe try vashing der combus-
tion chamber mit acid sulphuric inquired
schatz sometimes der lead giffs a second-
ary reaction-

 naw said jarvis disgustedly i
wouldnt try that of course-not more than
ten times besides the bump flattened the
landing gear and busted off the under-jets
he rubbed his nose again lucky for me a

eound only weighs seven ounces here or id
ave been mashed flat

  i could have fixed ejaculated the en-
gineer i bet it vas not serious

  probably not agreed jarvis sarcastical-
ly only it wouldnt fly anyway i rigged
up a harness from some seat straps and put
the water tank on my back took a cartridge
belt and revolver and some iron rations and
started out on shanks mare

  water tank exclaimed the little biolo-
gist leroy she weigh one-quarter ton
wasnt full weighed about two hundred
and fifty pounds earth-weight which is
eighty-five here of course i took a thermo-
skin sleeping bag for these wintry martian
nights

 off i went bouncing along pretty
quickly eight hours of daylight meant
twenty miles or more it got tiresome of
course-plugging along over a soft sand
desert with nothing to see not even leroys
crawling biopods but an hour or so brought
me to the canal-just a dry ditch about four
hundred feet wide and straight as a railroad
on its own company map

  thered been water in it sometime
though the ditch was covered with what
looked like a nice green lawn only as i
approached the lawn moved out of my
way

 h said leroy

  -erf yeah it was a relative of your
biopods i caught one-a little grasslike
blade about as long as my finger with two
thin stemmy legs 

  he is where leroy was eager

  he is let go i had to move so i flowed
along with the walking grass opening in
front and closing behind

  it was just before twilight that i reached
the edge of thyle and looked down over the
gray mare chronium and i knew there
was seventy-five miles of that to be walked
over and then a couple of hundred miles of
that xanthus desert and about as much
more mare cimmerium was i pleased i
cussed you fellows for not picking me up
we were trying you sap said harrison
that didnt help well i figured i might
as well use what wasleft of daylight in get-
ting down the cliff that bounded thyle up
to that time you know i hadnt seen any-
thing worth worrying about on this half-

dead world-nothing dangerous that is
  did you queried harrison

  did i youll hear about it when i come
to it well i was just about to turn in when
suddenly i heard the wildest sort of shenani-
gans

  vot iss shenanigans inquired schatz
he say je ne sais quoi explained le-
roy it is to say i dont know what
thats right agreed jarvis i didnt
know what so i sneaked over to find out
there was a racket like a flock of crows eat-
ing a bunch of canaries-whistles cackles
caws trills and what have you i rounded
a clump of stumps and there was tweel
tweel said harrison and tveel said
leroy and schatz

  that freak ostrich explained the nar-
rator at least tweel is as near as i can
pronounce it without sputtering he called
it something like trrrweerrlll

  what was he doing asked the captain
he was being eaten and squealing of
course as any one would

   eaten by what

  i found out later all i could see then
was a bunch of black ropy arms tangled
around what looked like as schatz described
it to you an ostrich i wasnt going to inter-
fere naturally if both creatures were dan-
gerous id have one less to worry about

  but the bird-like thing was putting up a
good battle dealing vicious blows with an
eighteen-inch beak between screeches and
besides i caught a glimpse or two of what
was on the end of those arms jarvis shud-
dered but the clincher was when i no-
ticed a little black bag or case hung about
the neck of the bird-thing it was intelli-
gent that or tame i assumed anyway
it clinched my decision i pulled out my
automatic and fired into what i could see of
its antagonist

  there was a flurry of tentacles and a spurt
of black corruption and then the thing with
a disgusting sucking noise pulled itself and
its arms into a hole in the ground the
other let out a series of clacks staggered
around on legs about as thick as golf sticks
and turned suddenly to face me i held my
weapon ready and the two of us stared at
each other

  the martian wasnt a bird really it
wasnt even birdlike except just at first
glance it had a beak all right and a few
feathery appendages but the beak wasnt
really a beak it was somewhat flexible i
could see the tip bend slowly from side to
side it was almost like a cross between a
beak and a trunk it had four-toed feet and
four-fingered things-hands you have to call
them and a little roundish body and a long
neck ending in a tiny head-and that beak
it stood an inch or so taller than i and-
well schatz saw it

the engineer nodded yah i saw
jarvis continued so-we stared at each
other finally the creature went into a series
of clackings and twitterings and held out its
hands toward me empty i took that as a
a martian odyssey

gesture of friendship

  perhaps suggested harrison it looked
at that nose of yours and thought you were
its brother

  huh you can be funny without talking
anyway i put up my gun and said aw
dont mention it or something of the sort
and the thing came over and we were pals

wjy that time the sun was pretty low
and i knew id better build a fire
i started breaking off chunks of this desic-
cated martian vegetation and my compan-
ion caught the idea and brought in an arm-
ful i reached for a match but the martian
fished into his pouch and brought out some-
thing that looked like a glowing coal one
touch of it and the fire was blazing-and
you all know what a job we have starting a
fire in this atmosphere

  we just couldnt connect i tried rock
and i tried star and tree and fire and
lord knows what else and try as i would
i couldnt get a single word nothing was
the same for two successive minutes and if
thats a language im an alchemist finally
i gave it up and called him tweel and that
seemed to do

  but tweel hung on to some of my words
he remembered a couple of them which i
suppose is a great achievement if youre used
to a language you have to make up as you
go along but i couldnt get the hang of
his talk either i missed some subtle point
or we just didnt think alike-and i rather
believe the latter view

  after a while i gave up the language
business and tried mathematics i scratched
two plus two equals four on the ground
and demonstrated it with pebbles again

h-l eres the story that revolutionized scientifiction prior
to the publication of stanley g weinbaums first story
a martian odyssey all the interplanetary stories were
ruled by one dominant concept-that future explorers will
step into another world and find conditions there similar
to those on earth authors usually pictured alien human
beings with two feet and two legs two eyes etc just as is
the case on earth although the chances are not one in a
million that such conditions will prevail

  stanley g weinbaum fully conscious of this thought
smashed these precepts in his first tale he presented his
own startling array of interplanetary life-forms-strange or-
ganisms evolved by strange environments

  a martian odyssey is more than a great story it is
the forerunner of stories io come and it will be forever
identified with the memory of stanley g weinbaum

  and that bag of his continued the nar-
rator that was a manufactured article
my friends press an end and she popped
open-press the middle and she sealed so
perfectly you couldnt see the line better
than zippers

  well we stared at the fire for a while
and i decided to attempt some sort of com-
munication with the martian i pointed at
myself and said dick he caught the drift
immediately stretched a bony claw at me
and repeated tick then i pointed at him
and he gave that whistle i called tweel i
cant imitate his accent things were going
smoothly to emphasize the names i re-
peated dick and then pointing at him
tweel

  there we stuck he gave some clacks
that sounded negative and said something
like p-p-p-proot and that was just the
beginning i was always tick but as for
him-part of the time he was tweel and
part of the time he was p-p-p-proot and
part of the time he was sixteen other noises

tweel caught the idea and informed me that
three plus three equals six once more we
seemed to be getting somewhere

  so knowing that tweel had at least a
grammar school education i drew a circle
for the sun pointing first at it and then at
the last glow of the sun then i sketched
mercury and venus and mother earth
and mars and finally pointing to mars i
swept my hand around in a sort of inclusive
gesture to indicate that mars was our cur-
rent environment i was working up to put-
ting over the idea that my home was on the
earth

  tweel understood my diagram all right
he poked his beak at it and with a great
deal of trilling and clucking he added dei-
mos and phobos to mars and then sketched
in the earths moon

  do you see what that proves it proves
that tweels race uses telescopes-that
theyre civilized

  does not snapped harrison the
moon is visible from here as a fifth magni-

startling stories

tude star they could see its revolutions
with the naked eye

  the moon yes said jarvis youve
missed my point mercury isnt visible and
tweel knew of mercury because he placed
the moon at the third planet not the second
if he didnt know mercury hed put the
earth second and mars third instead of
fourth see

  humph said harrison

  anyway proceeded jarvis i went on
with my lesson things were going
smoothly and it looked as if i could put the
idea over i pointed at the earth on my
diagram and then at myself and then to
clinch it i pointed to myself and then to
the earth itself shining bright green almost
at the zenith

  tweel set up such an excited clacking
that i was certain he understood he jumped
up and down and suddenly he pointed at
himself and then at the sky and then at
himself and at the sky again he pointed
at his middle and then at arcturus at his
head and then at spica at his feet and then
at half a dozen stars while i just gaped at
him

inphen all of a sudden he gave a tre-
-b- mendous leap man what a hop he
shot straight up into the starlight seventy-
five feet if an inch i saw him silhouetted
against the sky saw him turn and come
down at me head first and land smack on
his beak like a javelin there he stuck
square in the center of my sun-circle in the
sand-a bulls-eye

  nuts observed the captain plain
nuts

  thats what i thought too i just stared
at him open-mouthed while he pulled his
head out of the sand and stood up then i
figured hed missed my point and i went
through the whole blamed rigmarole again
and it ended the same way with tweel on
his nose in the middle of my picture

  maybe its a religious rite suggested
harrison

  maybe said jarvis dubiously well
there we were we could exchange ideas
up to a certain point and then-blooey
something in us was different unrelated i
dont doubt that tweel thought me just as
screwy as i thought him our minds simply
looked at the world from different view-
points and perhaps his viewpoint is as true
as ours but-we couldnt get together
thats all yet in spite of all difficulties i
liked tweel and i have a queer certainty
that he liked me

  nuts repeated the captain just daffy
anyway i finally gave it up and got into
my thermo-skin to sleep the fire hadnt
kept me any too warm but that damn sleep-
ing bag did got stuffy five minutes after i
closed myself in i opened it a little and
bingo some eighty-below-zero air hit my
nose and thats when i got this pleasant lit-
tle frostbite to add to the bump i acquired
during the crash of my rocket

  i dont know what tweel made of my

sleeping he sat around but when i woke
up he was gone id just crawled out of my
bag though when i heard some twittering
and there he came sailing down from that
three-story thyle cliff to alight on his beak
beside me i pointed to myself and toward
the north and he pointed at himself and
toward the south but when i loaded up and
started away he came along

 man how he traveled-a hundred and
fifty feet at a jump sailing through the air
stretched out like a spear and landing on
his beak he seemed surprised at my plod-
ding but after a few moments he fell in be-
side me only every few minutes hed go into
one of his leaps and stick his nose into the
sand a block ahead of me then hed come
shooting back at me it kept me nervous at
first to see that beak of his coming at me
like a spear but he always ended in the sand
at my side

  so the two of us plugged along across
the mare chronium we talked-not that
we understood each other you know but
just for company i sang songs and i sus-
pect tweel did too at least some of his
trillings and twitterings had a subtle sort of
rhythm

  then for variety tweel would display
his smattering of english words hed point
to an outcropping and say rock and point
to a pebble and say it again or hed touch
my arm and say tick and then repeat it
he seemed terrifically amused that the same
word meant the same thing twice in succes-
sion or that the same word could apply to
two different objects it set me wondering
if perhaps his language wasnt like the primi-
tive speech of some earth people-you know
captain like the negritos for instance who
havent any generic words no word for
food or water or man but words for good
food and bad food or rain water and sea
water or strong man and weak man-but no
names for general classes theyre too primi-
tive to understand that rain water and sea
water are just different aspects of the same
thing but that wasnt the case with tweel
is was just that we were somehow mysteri-
ously different-our minds were alien to
each other and yet-we liked each other

  looney thats all remarked harrison
thats why you two were so fond of each
other

  well i like you countered jarvis wick-
edly anyway he resumed dont over-
look the point that he managed to under-
stand a little of my mental workings while
i never even got a glimmering of his

  because he didnt have any suggested
the captain while schatz and leroy blinked
attentively

          can judge of that when im
through said jarvis well we
plugged along across the mare chronium
mare chronium-sea of time it was so
monotonous that i was even glad to see the
desert of xanthus toward the evening of the
second day

  i was fair worn out but tweel seemed
a martian odyssey	

as fresh as ever for all i never saw him drink
or eat i offered him some water once or
twice he took the cup from me and sucked
the liquid into his beak and then carefully
squirted it all back into the cup and gravely
returned it

  just as we sighted xanthus or the cliffs
that bounded it one of those nasty sand
clouds blew along not as bad as the one
we had here but mean to travel against
after the sand storm blew over a little wind
kept blowing in our faces not strong enough
to stir the sand but suddenly things came
drifting along from the xanthus cliffs-
small transparent spheres for all the world
like glass tennis balls but light-they were
almost light enough to float even in this thin
air-empty too i cracked open a couple
and nothing came out but a bad smell i
asked tweel about them but all he said was
no no no which i took to mean that he
knew nothing about them so they went
bouncing about like tumbleweeds or like
soap bubbles and we plugged on toward
xanthus tweel pointed at one of the crys-
tal balls once and said rock but i was too
tired to argue with him later i discovered
what he meant

  we came to the bottom of the xanthus
cliffs finally when there wasnt much day-
light left we were ambling around the base
of the xanthus barrier looking for an easy
spot to climb at least i was tweel could
have leaped it easily for the cliffs were
lower than thyle-perhaps sixty feet i
found a place and started up swearing at
the water tank strapped to my back-it
didnt bother me except when climbing-and
suddenly i heard a sound that i thought i
recognized

  you know how deceptive sounds are in
this thin air a shot sounds like the pop of
a cork but this sound was the drone of a
rocket and sure enough there went our sec-
ond auxiliary about ten miles to westward
between me and the sunset

  vas me said schau i hunt for you

  yeah i knew that but what good did it
do me i hung on to the cliff and yelled
and waved with one hand tweel saw it
too and set up a trilling and twittering leap-
ing to the top of the barrier and then high
into the air and while i watched the ma-
chine droned on into the shadows to the
south

  i was bitterly disappointed by the failure
to attract attention i pulled out my thermo-
skin bag and crawled into it as the night
chill was already apparent tweel stuck his
beak into the sand and drew up his legs
and arms and looked for all the world like
one of those leafless shrubs out there i
think he stayed that way all night

  protective mimicry ejaculated leroy
see he is desert creature

  in the morning resumed jarvis we
started off again we hadnt gone a hun-
dred yards into xanthus when i saw some-
thing queer this is one thing schatz didnt
photograph ill wager

  there was a line of little pyramids-tiny

ones not more than six inches high stretch-
ing across xanthus as far as i could see
little buildings made of pygmy bricks they
were hollow inside and truncated or at
least broken at the top and empty i pointed
at them and said what to tweel but he
gave some negative twitters to indicate i
suppose that he didnt know so off we
went following the row of pyramids because
they ran north and i was going north

  man we trailed that line for hours after
a while i noticed another queer thing they
were getting larger same number of bricks
in each one but the bricks were larger

  by noon they were shoulder high i
looked into a couple-all just the same
broken at the top and empty i examined
a brick or two as well they were silica and
old as creation itself

  how do you know asked leroy

  they were weathered-edges rounded
silica doesnt weather easily even on earth
and in this climate-

  how old you think

kift y thousand-a hundred
years how can i tell the little ones
we saw in the morning were older-perhaps
ten times as old crumbling how old
would that make them half a million years
who knows jarvis paused a moment
well he resumed we followed the line
tweel pointed at them and said rock once
or twice but hed done that many times
before besides he was more or less right
about these

  i tried questioning him i pointed at a
pyramid and asked people and indicated
the two of us he set up a negative sort of
chuckling and said no no no no one-
one-two no two-two-four meanwhile rub-
bing his stomach i just stared at him and he
went through the business again no one-
one-two no two-two-four i just gaped
at him

  that proves it exclaimed harrison
nuts

  you think so queried jarvis sardonical-
ly well i figured it out different no
one-one-two you dont get it of course
do you

  nope-nor do you

  i think i do tweel was using the few
english words he knew to put over a very
complex idea what let me ask does
mathematics make you think of

  why-of astronomy or-or logic
thats it no onc-one-two tweel
was telling me that the builders of the pyra-
mids werent people that they werent intel-
ligent that they werent reasoning creatures
get it

  huh ill be damned

  you probably will

  why did tweel rub his belly leroy
asked

  why because my dear biologist thats
where his brains were not in his tiny head
-in his middle

  cest impossible

  not on mars it isnt this flora and


startling stories

fauna arent earthly your biopods prove
that i jarvis grinned and took up his nar-
rative anyway we plugged along across
xanthus and in about the middle of the after-
noon something else queer happened the
pyramids ended

  ended i

  yeah the queer part was that the last
one-and now they were ten-footers-was
capped see whatever built it was still
inside wed trailed em from their half-mil-
lion-year-old origin to the present

  tweel and i both noticed it about the
same time i yanked out my automatic i
had a clip of boland explosive bullets in it
and tweel quick as a sleight-of-hand trick
snapped a queer little glass revolver out of
his bag it was much like our weapons
except that the grip was larger to accommo-
date his four-taloned hand and we held our
weapons ready while we sneaked up along
the lines of empty pyramids

  tweel saw the movement first the top
tiers of bricks were heaving shaking and
suddenly slid down the sides with a thin
crash and then-something-something
was coming out

  a long silver-gray arm appeared drag-
ging after it an armored body armored i
mean with scales silver-gray and dull-shin-
ing the arm heaved the body out of the
hole the beast crashed to the sand

  it was a nondescript creature-body like
a big gray cask arm and a sort of mouth-
hole at one end stiff pointed tail at the
other-and thats all no other limbs no
eyes ears nose-nothing the thing
dragged itself a few yards inserted its
pointed tail in the sand pushed itself upright
and just sat

  tweel and i watched it for ten minutes
before it moved then with a creaking and
rustling like-oh like crumpling stiff paper
-its arm moved to the mouth-hole and out
came a brick the arm placed the brick care-
fully on the ground and the thing was still
again

  another ten minutes-another brick just
one of natures bricklayers i was about
ready to slip away and move on when tweel
pointed at the thing and said rock i went
huh and he said it again then to the
accompaniment of some of his trilling he
said no-no- and gave two or three
whistling breaths

  well i got his meaning for a wonder
i said no breath and demonstrated the
word tweel was ecstatic he said yes
yes yes no no no breet then he gave
a leap and sailed out to land on his nose
about one pace from the monster

was startled you can imagine the
arm was going up for a brick and i
expected to see tweel caught and mangled
but-nothing happened tweel pounded on
the creature and the arm took the brick
and placed it neatly beside the first tweel
rapped on its body again and said rock
and i got up nerve enough to take a look
myself

  tweel was right again the creature was
rock and it didnt breathe

  how you know snapped leroy his
black eyes blazing interest

  because im a chemist the beast was
made of silica there must have been pure
silicon in the sand and it lived on that get
it we and tweel and those plants out
there and even the biopods are carbon life
this thing lived by a different set of chemical
reactions it was silicon life

  la vie silicieuse shouted leroy i
have suspect and now it is proof i must
go see ii faut que je-

  all right all right said jarvis you
can go see anyhow there the thing was
alive and yet not alive moving every ten min-
utes and then only to remove a brick those
bricks were its waste matter see frenchy
were carbon and our waste is carbon diox-
ide and this thing is silicon and its waste
is silicon dioxide-silica but silica is a solid
hence the bricks and it built itself in and
when it was covered it moved over to a
fresh place to start over  no wonder it
creaked a living creature half a million
years old

 how you know how old leroy was
frantic

  we trailed its pyramids from the begin-
ning didnt we if this werent the original
pyramid builder the series would have ended
somewhere before we found him wouldnt
it ended and started over with the small
ones thats simple enough isnt it

  but he reproduces or tries to before
the third brick came out there was a little
rustle and out popped a whole stream of
those little crystal balls theyre his spores
or eggs or seeds-call em what you want
they went bouncing by across xanthus
just as theyd bounced by us back in the
mare chronium ive a hunch how they
work too-this is for your information le-
roy i think the crystal shell of the silica
is no more than a protective covering like
an eggshell and that the active principle is
the smell inside its some sort of gas that
attacks silicon and if the shell is broken near
a supply of that element sjme reaction
starts that ultimately develops into a beast
like that one

  you should try exclaimed the little
frenchman we must break one to see
yeah well i did i smashed a couple
against the sand would you like to come
back in about ten thousand years to see
if i planted some pyramid monsters youd
most likely be able to tell by that time
jarvis paused and drew a deep breath
lord that queer creature do you pic-
ture it blind deaf nerveless brainless-just
a mechanism and yet-immortal bound to

so on making bricks building pyramids as
ong as silicon and oxygen exist and even
afterwards itll just stop it wont be dead
if the accidents of a million years bring it its
food again there itll be ready to run again
while brains and civilizations are part of the
past a queer beast-yet i met a stranger

x-rays

editor science question box

of what use besides being an aid to surgery are x-rays can you give me a number
of illustrations of some of the other functions-c m cambridge mass

  one interesting use to which x-ray a are

fiut is to destroy a microbe which attack the
eaves of the tobacco plant many other
x-ray appliances have nothin to do with
medicine custom-house officials sometimes
examine bales and packages to find whether
objects liable to duty liave been concealed in

stones can in many cases be distinguished
from imitations when examined with the
x-ray the diamond will appear transparent
while imitation stones look almost black

future evolution

  evolution is supposed to be a continuous process
affected-o b duluth minnesota

  man is being affected by evolution and he
is constantly evolving thats the opinion of
dr ales hrdlicka curator of physical an-
thropology of the smithsonian institution

dr hrdlicka bases his outlook for the human
future partly on the unique collection of
 human skulls which ho has assembled
during a lifetime of work in the u s na-
tional museum ancient and modern skull
alike show great variability in both size and
shape and as long as a species is capable
of variation it is evolutionary youthful

  mans cousins the great apes however
have aa such cheerful future before them
they are senile races headed down the hill

the skulls of great apes however display a
higher degree of specialization a freezing
into one standardized form for each species

tills spells biological conservatism stftgna-

if that is the case why isnt man

 tion eventual extinction dr hrdlicka ac-
 cords the greatest variability and hence the
 best chance evolutionally to the adaptable

   although the best brains of today are not
 better than those of ancient greece and
 egypt the average is higher the veteran an-

 tiquity were centuries ahead of their times-
 unique and lonely individuals nowadays the

    dedicated to the exploration of the unknown the prophecy of things to
    come-its the magazine of tomorrow

 with its first issue startling stories introduced a brand-new pol-

in every number it was a bold promise but we felt certain we could fulfil it

  even our heartiest well-wishers said it couldnt be done that no magazine
could continue to maintain the excellent standard set by the first number that

it would be impossible to score a perfect
bulls-eye with each successive novel

williams novel different

by gene thornton newsome

  may i add my comment to that of the thou-
sands of other enthusiastic readers of starti-ino
stokixk ami sclenllqction

  robert moore williams the bridge to the
earth is so utterly different from any science
fiction tale that i have ever read in these past
two years that i plead on bended knee for morn
of such different stories i am afraid it would
be a different story entirely if the happenings
had occurred in  or  we would have no
defense against miscroscopic beings as the mar-
lines  or would we

  robert arthurs cosmic stage wan a superb
short story more dimansion stories are hoped
for from this guy

  the misty wilderness had a somewhat com-
mon plot but was interesting not as a science
fiction story but as an adventure story

  your hall of fame story le tho type that
the ether vibrates



leaves you wondering too much cant bay i
liked it too well although i enjoy hamiltons
stories generally they arc definitely full of life

analysis

by louis goldstone jr

  a few comments on the progress of staetlimo
stories first of all i realize that any and all
evaluations of fiction are purely relative each
reader rates the stories according to the measure
of enjoyment and pleasure derived from the
reading at least i believe that this can be the
only true standard of rating some people of
course are ever-vlgliant for scientific flaws etc
and often overlook examples of well-applied sci-
ence or allow trifling inaccuracies to spoil for
them a good ploce of science fiction personally
i read primarily for enjoyment and have inci-
dentally acquired a fair store of genuine scien-
tific knowledge from science fiction over a period
of ten years

  there can be no doubt that science fiction is
improving in quality i say that as a general-
ization for the nine magazines on the stands to-
day shovel a good deal that smells along with
the worthy startling storks i think is get-
ting its second wind the magazine began with
weinbaums black flame staggered a bit with
binders impossible world a story that was
to my mind saved from mediocrity by finlays
illustrations broke stride and almost dropped
out with hamiltons prisoner of mars grit-
ted its teeth and kept pounding with wellmans
giants from eternity and now forges ahead
again with williams bridge to earth i look
forward to williamson coming story which i
am sure will not be disappointing

  in bridge to earth i was pleased by the
authors explanation of the phenomenon of the
fiamlng death as being the manifestation of
electrons dropping to the lower energy-levels i
cannot recall having seen this idea used before-
whlle the bridge to earth is no new plot and
embodies old ideas it is written in that pleasdng
style which makes williams one of my favorite
authors his short stories such aa beyond that
curtain were very good i hope to see more of
his work in the near future

  one request-regarding your  ustrationa
pictures can make or break a story the artist
illustrating a novel or a short gives the reader
his first impression of the yarn an impression
that is difficult to break so keep your good
artists-and get rid of the unpopular ones my
own preferences are schneeman wesso and fin-
lay wesso was at his best in the bridge to
earth those pictures of the marlings in the
human spinal column were great finlays draw-
ing on page  of the march  issue was a
masterpiece his drawing for cosmic stage
in the current issue was quite good

  on the whole i like startling storibs and t
am sure that it will have a fine future keep
away from hack-writing if you can do this
youre all set i think you are trying and thats
all that can be expected

  the reprints are satisfactory however as
long as your choice of reprints is restricted to
sheets how about city of the living-dead by
manning and pratt

  tour cover contest looks interesting big-
headed monsters dragging beautiful babes from
their desecrated graves

  brown does well on the covers you might

feminine-less issue

by isaac asimov

   there isa great lal of slgcseconce i think in
the fact that the fou suri-- of the september
issue of startlinc sttsob aid net contain a
single female character of come i would be
the last to claim that all bntlm be abolished
women when luuioiej la axri-r-itvn and with

extreme decency fit nicely in sdentifiction at
times however the september issue goes to
prove that good stories can be written even with
the total absence of the weaker sex

  there are some fans that claim human in-
terest a necessity in stf since otherwise stories
degenerate into uninteresting scientific or semi-
selentlfic recitals that is a very correct stand
or would be if it were not that these one-track-
minded fans know no other form of- human in-
terest than the love interest

   well let them read bridge to earth and tell
me what it loses in not possessing a heroine
where would the story have been improved in
having a heroine get caught by the microscopic
creatures and haring the hero rescue her get-
ting her caught again having the hero rescue
hor again then the hero getting caught and the
heroine rescuing ftimf that always happens
when a shemale is brought in usually by the
hair and if thats human interest or any other
kind of interest then im a pickled herring

   three cheers for r m williams for refraining
from falling into this morass of hack

  however mr williams falls into a different
error of purely scientific nature which since it
has been indulged in by various authors ever
since the beginnings of stf it is high time to
correct once and for all

  in reducing a man to microscopic size by com-
pressing the spaces between the atoms you re-
duce his size all right but you dont reduce his
mass-since all the atoms originally in him re-
main unchanged in mass or number in short
the microscopic hero weighs his full quota of g
pounds though no bigger than the dot of an i
on this page in such a condition his density
approaches pretty near neutronium and normal
human beings and normal matter the earth it-
self even are to him only a rather thick vac-
uum when coughed out onto the carpet for
instance he would sink to the very center of the
earth because nothing on earth can hold up 
pounds compressed into a microscopic granule

  of course a small army of men all weighing
 pounds plus a military tank as well all in-
side one poor suffering human is just too ridicu-
lous

  this is not to say that i did not enjoy the
yarn i did but sometimes i do wish that au-
thors when shrinking or expanding their char-
acters either remember that mass remains un-
changed or choose gome method other than
changing the amount of space between atoma

startlingly different

by ray e gower

  you are certainly to be congratulated on the
type of sdentifiction stories that are finding their
way into startling stories every issue seems
to get away from the usual run of stories into
something startllngly different

   i believe you will better appreciate my opinion
of your magazine if i tell you that i have fol-
lowed nearly all the sdentifiction magazines

  i started reading startling stories with the
may issue and i want to say its swell i
have not enjoyed a long novel so much since the
old days as a matter of fact good long novels
have been pretty scarce lately and im glad to
see them back

  i too ain in favor of your printing mannings
seeds from space in your hall of fame this
story originally appeared in the june  issue
of wonder stories and i am certain those who
have not already read it will consider the yarn
excellent another story i would like to see
again is the mole-men of mercury

and everything seemed plausible but one thing

lovecraft

by donald wandrei and august w derleth

  after two years of careful editing the works
of h p lovecraft are beginning to take shape
in readiness for the eyes of a printer at this
writing-june -the first volume the out-
sider and others is ready to go to press provid-
ed that enough subscriptions to it are forthcom-
ing to justify our personally guaranteeing the
cost of printing because the outsider and
others is an omnibus volume containing with
but a few minor exceptions all the stories of
lovecraft together with his complete and re-
cently revised supernatural rotror in litera-
ture and an introductory biographical sketch of
lovecraft printing costs make it necessary for
us to ask  per copy for the outsider and
others if ordered before publication  if
ordered after

  we plan to publish so that the book will be
ready for distribution in december of this year
but frankly we must have subscriptions first
if we have a sufficient quantity of books on order
by september or october first we will instruct
the printer to go forward and when we write
subscriptions we mean cash in hand in other
words we are asking those who want copies of
this book to send their checks to august derleth
sauk city wisconsin as soon as possible these
checks will be deposited against the expense of
publication  any net profit of course will go to
mrs gamwell-but there is little chance of net
profit

  we need not take space to sell this book to
you who have known the work of hpl but we
do ask for your utmost co-operation in this im-
portant publishing event we do want you to talk
this book up among fellow fans who may not be
so familiar with lovecrafts work and we do
want you to send in your own checks just as
soon as possible so that we can go ahead with
the printing of this book if after two or three

months insufficient funds have been pledged or
sent and we find it impossible to go on with
plans at this time all money will be refunded
but such a situation will certainly not arise if
we have the co-operation we have every reason
to expect

  let us hear from you just as soon as possible
we are planning an edition of only  copies
but in case of orders in advance of this number
our print order will be raised

masterful novel

by art r sehnert

  i have just finished reading your july issue of
startling stories i have yet to see a better
story than the one giants from eternity
wellman wrote the novel masterfully never
was a story told more interestingly hi char-
acterization of pasteur et al is beyond doubt a
literary masterpiece i would like to compli-
ment him on one point especially when nor-
fleet returned the five immortal scientists to life
wellman didnt state whether or not their souls
returned to their bodies well wellman must
be an excellent diplomat only a well informed
psychologist would have known that any men-
tion of the word sour would have offended some
people and that denying its return would have
offended some others-so he did the only sensible
thing and didnt mention that angle here is
my nomination of manly wade wellman for
ranking with scientifictlons leading ten writers

  i think your feature hall of fame an excel-
lent contribution to scientifiction i know i
would not have had the pleasure of reading
world without name ouierwise

  could you possibly add a department to ss
one where we readers who like to uieorize
could expound our theories and receive criti-

  if you did it must have been in your
dreams growled harrison

  youre right said jarvis soberly in
a way youre right the dream-beast
thats the best name for it-and its the most
fiendish terrifying creation one could im-
agine more dangerous than a lion more
insidious than a snake i

  tell me begged leroy i must go see
not this devil he paused again well
he resumed tweel and i left the pyramid
creature and plowed along through xanthus
i was tired and a little disheartened by
schatzs failure to pick me up and tweels
trilling got on my nerves as did his flying
nosedives so i just strode along without
a word hour after hour across that monoto-
nous desert

  toward mid-afternoon wc came in sight
of a low dark line on the horizon it was
a canal

  wc approached the canal slowly i re-
membered that this one was bordered by a
wide fringe of vegetation and that mud-
heap city was on it

      was tired i kept thinking of a good
hot meal and from that i jumped to
reflections of how nice and homelike even
borneo would seem after this crazy planet
and from that to thoughts of little old new
york and then to thinking about a girl i
know there-fancy long know her
vision entertainer said harrison ive
tuned her in nice blonde-dances and sings
on the yerba mate hour

  thats her said jarvis ungrammatically
i know her pretty well-just friends get me
-though she came down to see us off in the
ares well i was thinking about her feel-
ing pretty lonesome and all of a sudden
there she was

  yes there she was-fancy long stand-
ing plain as day under one of those crack-
brained trees and smiling and waving just
the way i remembered her when we left
now youre nuts too observed the cap-
tain

  boy i almost agreed with you i stared
and pinched myself and closed my eyes and
then stared again-and every time there was
fancy long smiling and waving tweel
saw something too he was trilling and
clucking away but i scarcely heard him
i was bounding toward her over the sand
too amazed even to ask myself questions

  i wasnt twenty feet from her when
tweel caught me with one of his flying leaps
he grabbed my arm yelling no-no-no
in his squeaky voice i tried to shake him off
-he was as light as if he were built of bam-
boo-but he dug his claws in and yelled
and finally some sort of sanity returned to
me and i stopped less than ten feet from
her there she stood looking as solid as
schatzs head

why men go bald
a martian odyssey



  she smiled and waved and waved and
smiled and i stood there as dumb as leroy
while tweel squeaked and chattered i
knew it couldnt be real yet-there she was

  finally i said fancy fancy long
she just kept on smiling and waving but
looking as real as if i hadnt left her thirty-
seven million miles away

  tweel had his glass pistol out pointing
it at her i grabbed his arm but he tried
to push me away he pointed at her and
said no breet no breet and i understood
that he meant that the fancy long thing
wasnt alive man my head was whirling

  still it gave me the jitters to see him
pointing his weapon at her i dont know
why i stood there watching him take care-
ful aim but i did then he squeezed the
handle of his weapon there was a little puff
of steam and fancy long was gone and
in her place was one of those writhing black
rope-armed horrors like the one id saved
tweel from

  the dream-beast i stood there dizzy
watching it die while tweel trilled and
whistled finally he touched my arm pointed
at the twisting thing and said you one-one-
two he one-one-two after hed repeated it
eight or ten times i got it do any of you
ou shrilled leroy moi-je le com-
prends he mean you think of something
the beast he know and you see it un chien
-a hungry dog he would see a big bone with
meat or smell it-not

  right said jarvis the dream-beast
uses its victims longings and desires to trap
its prey the bird at nesting season would
see its mate the fox prowling for its own
prey would see a helpless rabbit

  how he do queried leroy

  how do i know how does a snake back
on earth charm a bird into its very jaws
and arent there deep-sea fish that lure their
victims in their mouths lord jarvis
shuddered do you see how insidious the
monster is were warned now-but hence-
forth we cant trust even our eyes you
might see me-i might see you-and back
of it be nothing but another of those black
horrors

  hawd your friend know asked the
captain abruptly

  tweel i wonder perhaps he was
thinking of something that couldnt possibly
have interested me and when i started to
run he realized that i saw something dif-
ferent and was warned or perhaps thte
dream-beast can only project a single vision
and tweel saw what i saw-or nothing i
couldnt ask him but its just another proof
that his intelligence is equal to ours or
greater

 es daffy i tell you said harrison

   whaf makes you think his intel-
lect ranks with the human

  plenty of things first the pyramid-
beast he hadnt seen one before he said
as much yet he recognized it as a dead-alive

he could have heard of it objected har-
rison he lives around here you know

  well how about the language i couldnt
pick up a single idea of his and he learned
six or seven words of mine and do you
realize what complex ideas he put over with
no more than those six or seven words
the pyramid-monster-the drcam-beast in
a single phrase he told me that one was a
harmless automaton and the other a deadly
hypnotist what about that

  huh said the captain

  huh if you wish the point im making
is that tweel and his race are worthy of our
friendship somewhere on mars-and youll
find im right-is a civilization and culture
equal to ours and maybe more than equal
and communication is possible between
them and us tweel proves that it may take
years of patient trial for their minds are
alien but less alien than the next minds we
encountered-if they are minds

  the next ones what next ones

  the people of the mud cities along the
canals jarvis frowned then resumed his
narrative i thought the dream-beast and
the silicon-monster were the strangest be-
ings conceivable but i was wrong the
mound city id noticed from the rocket was
a mile or so to the right and i was curious
enough to want to take a look at it

  it has seemed deserted from my previous
glimpse of it and if any creatures were lurk-
ing in it-well tweel and i were both armed
and by the way that crystal weapon of
tweels was an interesting device i took a
look at it after the dream-beast episode it
fired a little glass splinter poisoned i sup-
pose and i guess it held at least a hundred
of em to a load the propellant was steam
-just plain steam

  shteam echoed schatz from vot come
shteam

  from water of course you could see
the water through the transparent handle
and about a gill of another liquid thick and
yellowish when tweel squeezed the handle
-there was no trigger-a drop of water and
a drop of the yellow stuff squirted into the
firing chamber and the water vaporized-
pop-like that i think we could develop
the same principle concentrated sulphuric
acid will heat water almost to boiling and
so will quicklime and theres potassium and
sodium-

  anyway we trudged along toward the
mud-heap city and i began to wonder
whether the city builders dug the canals i
pointed to the city and then at the canal and
tweel said no-no-no and gestured
toward the south i took it to mean that
some other race had created the canal sys-
tem perhaps tweels people i dont know
maybe theres still another intelligent race
on the planet or a dozen others mars is
a queer little world

  a hundred yards from the city we crossed
a sort of road-just a hrd-packed mud trail
and then all of a sudden along came one of
the mound builders

  man talk about fantastic beings it
looked rather like a barrel trotting along on
four legs with four other arms or tentacles
it had no head just body and members and
a row of eyes completely around it the
top end of the barrel-body was a diaphragm
stretched as tight as a drum head and that
was all it was pushing a little coppery cart
and tore right past us like the proverbial
bat out of hell it didnt even notice us
although i thought the eyes on my side
shifted a little as it passed

  a moment later another came along
pushing another empty cart same thing-it
just scooted past us well i wasnt going
to be ignored by a bunch of barrels playing
train so when the third one approached i
planted myself in the way-ready to jump
of course if the thing didnt stop

  but it did it stopped and set up a sort
of drumming from the diaphragm on top
and i held out both hands and said mildly
we are friends and what do you sup-
pose the thing did

  said pleased to meet you ill bet
suggested harrison

  i couldnt have been more surprised if it
had it drummed on its diaphragm and
then suddenly boomed out we are v-r-
riends and gave its pushcart a vicious poke
at me i jumped aside and away it went
while i stared dumbly after it

 a minute later another one came
a hurrying along this one didnt
pause but simply drummed out we are
v-r-r-riends and scurried by how did it
learn the phrase were all of the creatures
in some sort of communication with each
other were they all parts of some central
organism i dont know though i think
tweel does

  anyway the creatures went sailing past
us every one greeting us with the same
statement it got to be funny i never
thought to find so many friends on this god-
forsaken ball finally i made a puzzled ges-
ture to tweel i guess he understood for he
said one-one-two - yes - two-two-four-
no get it

  sure said harrison its a martian
nursery rhyme

  yeah well i was getting used to
tweels symbolism and i figured it out this
way one-one-two-yes the creatures
were intelligent two-two-four-nol-their
intelligence was not of our order but some-
thing different and beyond the logic of two
and two is four maybe i missed his mean-
ing perhaps he meant that their minds
were of low degree able to figure out the
simple things-one-one-two-yes but not
more difficult things-two-two-four-no
but i think from what we saw later that he
meant the other

  after a few moments the creatures came
rushing back-first one then another their
pushcarts were full of stones sand chunks
of rubbery plants and such rubbish as that
they droned out their friendly greeting

 which didnt really sound so friendly and
 dashed on the third one i assume to be
 my first acquaintance and i decided to have
 another chat with him i stepped into his
 path again and waited

   up he came booming out his we are
 v-r-r-riends and stopped i looked at him
 four or five of his eyes looked at me he
 tried his password again and gave a shove
 on his cart but i stood firm and then the
 -the dashed creature reached out one of his
 arms and two finger-like nippers tweaked
 my nose

  haw roared harrison maybe the
 things have a sense of beauty

   laugh grumbled jarvis id already
 had a nasty bump and a mean frost-bite on
 that nose anyway i yelled ouch and

 umped aside and the creature dashed away
 tut from then on their greeting was we are
 v-r-r-riends ouch queer beasts

   tweel and i followed the road squarely
 up to the nearest mound the creatures
 were coming and going paying us not the
 slightest attention fetching their loads of
 rubbish the road simply dived into an
 opening and slanted down like an old mine
 and in and out darted the barrel-people
 greeting us with their eternal phrase

   i looked in there was a light somewhere
 below i was curious so in i went and
 tweel tagged along not without a few
 trills and twitters however

   the light was curious it sputtered and
 flared like an old arc light but came from a
 single black rod set in the wall of the corri-
 dor it was electric beyond doubt the
 creatures were fairly civilized apparently

  then i saw another light shining on
 something that glittered and i went on to
 look at that but it was only a heap of shiny
 sand i turned toward the entrance to leave
 and the devil take me if the entrance wasnt
 gone

   i suppose the corridor had curved or id
 stepped into a side passage anyway i
 walked back in the direction i thought wed
 come and all i saw was more dim-lit corri-
 dor the place was a labyrinth there was
 nothing but twisting passages running every
 way lit by occasional lights and now and
 then a creature running by sometimes with
 a pushcart sometimes without

   well i wasnt much worried at first
 tweel and i had only come a few steps from
 the entrance but every move we made af-
 ter that seemed to get us in deeper i
 dumped my water tank on the floor and sat
 down

   tweel was as lost as i i pointed up and
 he said no-no-no in a sort of helpless
 trill and we couldnt get any help from the
 natives they paid us no attention at all ex-
 cept to assure us they were friends-ouch

   lord i dont know how many hours or
 days we wandered around there i slept
 twice from sheer exhaustion tweel never
 seemed to need sleep

   we saw plenty of strange things there
 were machines running in some of the cor-
a martian odyssey



ridors but they didnt seem to be doing any- 
thing-just wheels turning and several
times i saw two barrel-beasts with a little
one growing between them joined to both

fparthenogenesisr exulted le-
a roy parthenogenesis by budding- i
like les talipes

  if you say so frenchy agreed jarvis i
the things never noticed us at all except j
as i say to greet as with we are v-r-r-
riends oocb they seemed to have no
home-life of any sort but jost scurried
around with their pushcarts bringing in rub-
bish- and finally i discovered what they
did with it

   wed had a little lack with a corridor one
that slanted upjrds for a great distance i
wa feeling that we ooght to be tlose to the
surface wher surjdeniy the passage de-
bouched into a domed camber the only one
wed seen and man i felt like dancing
when i saw wist looked like daylight
through a crevice ia the roof

  there was a sort of machine in the cham-
ber just an enonaoos wheel that turned
slowly an-i cth   re creatures was in the
act of dc---j h rubbish below it the
wheel ground - wrth a crunch-sand stones
plants all into ponder that sifted away
somewhere wide we watched others filed
in repeating the pronta and that seemed to
be all no rteytae or reason to the whole
thing-be thats characteristic of this crazy
planet and there waa another fact thats
almost too biant to beheve
one of the cretiartt having dumped his
load poshed tm cart aside with a crash and
calmly shoved biattm mdei the wheel 
watched him crashed too stupefied to make
a sound and a bmmm later another fol-
lowed him  the were perfectly methodical
about it too c-t of the cart less creatures
took the abandoned pashcart

  tweel dktet ma surprised i pointed
out the neat	to --i and he just gave

the most h-s-tta shrug imaginable as
much as to say what can  do about it
he must hae fcaewn more or less about
these creatures

  then i saw sonecteng else there was
somethin beyond the wheel something
shining on a sort of low pedestal i walked
over there was a little crystal about the size
of an egg fluorescing to beat tophet the
light from it stung my hands and face al-
most like a static discharge and then i no-
ticed another funny thing remember that
wart i had on my left thumb look

  jarvis extended his hand

  it dried up and fell off-just like that
and my abused nose-say the pain went out
of it like magic the thing had the property
of hard x-rays or gamma radiations only
more so it destroyed diseased tissue and left
healthy tissue unharmed i

i was thinking what a present thatd be to
take back to mother earth when a lot of
racket interrupted we dashed back to the
other side of the wheel in time to see one of

          continued from page 
the pushcarts ground up some suicide had
been careless it seems

  then suddenly the creatures were boom-
ing and drumming all around us and their
noise was decidedly menacing a crowd of
them advanced toward us we backed out of
what i thought was the passage wed entered
by and they came rumbling after us some
pushing carts and some not crazy brutes
there was a whole chorus of we are v-r-r-
riends ouch i didnt like the ouch it
was rather suggestive

  tweel had his glass gun out and i
dumped my water tank for greater freedom
and got mine we backed up the corridor
with the barrel-beasts following - about
twenty of them queer thing-the ones
coming in with loaded carts moved past us
inches away without a sign

  tweel must have noticed that suddenly
he snatched out that glowing coal cigar-
lighter of his and touched a cart-load of
plant limbs puff the whole load was
burning-and the crazy beast pushing it
went right along without a change of pace
it created some disturbance among our
v-r-r-riends however-and then i noticed
the smoke eddying and swirling past us and
sure enough there was the entrance

  i grabbed tweel and out we dashed and
after us our twenty pursuers the daylight
felt like heaven though i saw at first glance
that the sun was all but set and that was bad
since i couldnt live outside my thermo-skin
bag in a martian night-at least without a
fire

  and things got worse in a hurry they
cornered us in an angle between two
mounds and there we stood i hadnt fired
nor had tweel there wasnt any use in irri-
tating the brutes they stopped a little dis-
tance away and began their booming about
friendship and ouches

  then things got still worse a barrel-
brute came out with a pushcart and they all
grabbed into it and came out with handfuls
of foot-long copper darts-and suddenly
there was a thunderous booming of v-r-r-
riends and ouches and a whole army of em
came out of their hole

ilman we were through and i knew

  tm it then i realized that tweel
wasnt he could have leaped the mound be-
hind us as easily as not he was staying for
me

  say i could have cried if thered been
time id liked tweel from the first but
whether id have had gratitude to do what
he was doing-suppose i had saved him
from the first dream-beast-hed done as
much for me hadnt he i grabbed his arm
and said tweel and pointed up and he un-
derstood he said no-no-no tick and
popped away with his glass pistol

   what could i do id be a goner anyway
when the sun set but i couldnt explain that
to him i said thanks tweel youre a
man and felt that i wasnt paying him any
compliment at all a man there are

best fun fiction and fotos w
 mighty few men whod do that

   so i went bang with my gun and tweel
 went puff with his and the barrels were
 throwing darts and getting ready to rush us
 and booming about being friends i had
 given up hope then suddenly an angel
 dropped right down from heaven in the
 shape of schatz with his under-jets blasting
 the barrels into very small pieccs

   wow i let out a yell and dashed for the
 rocket schatz opened the door and in i
 went laughing and crying and shouting it
 was a moment or so before i remembered
 tweel i looked around in time to see him
 rising in one of his nosedives over the mound
 and away

   i had a devil of a job arguing schatz
 into following by the time we got the
 rocket aloft darkness was down you know
 how it comes here-like turning off a light
 we sailed out over the desert and put down
 once or twice i yelled tweel and yelled
 it a hundred times i guess we couldnt
 find him he could travel like the wind and
 all i got-or else i imagined it-was a faint
 trilling twittering drifting out of the south
 hed gone and damn it i wish-i wish he
 hadnt

  the four men of the ares were silent-
 even the sardonic harrison at last little
 leroy broke the stillness

   i should like to see he murmured

  yeah said harrison and the wart-
 cure too bad you missed that it might be
 the cancer cure theyve been hunting for a
 century and a half

  oh that muttered jarvis gloomily
 thats what started the fight he drew a
 glistening object from his pocket

have you ever tried have you ever at-
tempted ever the least bit of training un-
der competent guidance

  or have you been sitting back as it is so
easy to do waiting for the day to comc some
time when you will awaken all of a sudden to
the discovery i am a writer

   if tin latter course is till one of yonr choosing you
probably never will write lawyers must be law clerks
kiiglnt-ars must be draftsmen we all know that lu
our tliuee tlic egg does come before the chicken

   it is seldom that any one bccomes a writer until he
or she has been writing for some time that is why
so many authors anil wrlterts spring up out of the
newspaper business tlio day-to-day necessity of
writing-of gathering material about which to write
-develops their talent their background and their
confidence as nothing else could

   that is why the newspaper institute of america
bases its writing instruction on journalism-continu-
ous writing-the training that has produced so many
successful authors

learn to write by writing

ewspapkb institute training is based on the new

i york copy-dcsk method it starts and keeps yon
writing in your own home on your own time week by
week you receive actual assignments just as if you were
right at work on a great metropolitan daily your writing
is individually corrected and constructively criticized by
veteran editors you will find that instead of vainly trying

thrills in science

          concluded from page 
was functioning perfectly yet there was no
ether-lag and since theory demanded-as
the honored lorentz himself had calculated
-that there must be a lag michelson had
failed his apparatus was so much junk
he had raced with light and lost

  bitter moment he turned away from the
instruments with sagging shoulders he had
failed and he had taxed his inventive powers
to the utmost no use trying to make a
better apparatus the weary lines of his
face suddenly changed to crinkles of deter-
mination why must he be wrong why
not place the blame on theory

  morley he half shouted were going
to announce that there actually is no ether-
drag theory is wrong were right

  it was a daring statement for michelson
to make armed as he was with his unproved
apparatus the american was the laughing
stock of science but michelson had many
staunch admirers too and these men
agreed with him since the michelson-
morley experiment had shown no ether-
drag there simply was no ether-drag

  turmoil arose in the world of science
the whole structure of physical theory
threatened to collapse the cry went up that
the overconfident american had failed just
as everyone had expected he had deluded
himself in thinking he could match natures
speed records with mans clumsy engines

  for ten long heart-breaking years michel-
sons results were pigeon-holed as faulty
he stood by the sidelines waiting hopefully
for the theoreticians to change their sen-
tence on him he couldnt be wrong he
had checked his apparatus and principles a
hundred times was he never to know vin-
dication for his hard labors

  but eventually other experimenters tried
to measure the ether-drift in various ways
none succeeded were they all bad tech-
nicians or-the thought bit deeper like a
strong acid-was orthodox the-
ory wrong

  in desperation a new theory was whipped
into shape the profound lorentz himself
devised with a colleague the famous lo-
rentz-fitzgerald contraction theory stating
that objects contracted in the direction of
motion and michclson was told in the
manner of parents informing a little child
that all the while his very instruments had
physically shortened and changed imper-
ceptible trifling changes but sufficient to
make them worthless for the super-delicate
work required of them it was indirect re-
proof why hadnt the so-clever american
noticed that simple fact

  michelson tasted the bitterness of that ex-
planation it meant that his whole experi-
ment was useless from the start true he
had forced the lordly theorists to revise their
ideas but they still claimed there was an
ether-drift that the daring american could
never detect with all his ability michelson
couldnt swallow that by all the stars in
heaven there was no ether-drag

best fun fiction and fotos 


  eighteen years later 

  einstein-relativity a complete new vi-
sualization of the universe much more
plausible than any offered before einstein
too said there was no ether-drag light
had a uniform unchangeable speed regard-
less of motion because all motion was rela-
tive and einstein credited all inspiration
for his great new theory at the doorstep of
the michelson-morley experiment

  the american who had dared to run a
race with unbeatable light had at least come
out a tie and he had placed the cornerstone
of all modem theory of the entire universe

 science question box

concluded from page 

  theres yet one other important handicap
which puls our present insect pygmies behind
the scientific eight-ball animal activity in-
telligent or otherwise always depends upon
the working of nerve cells stereotyped ac-
tion  matter how marvelous it may seem
can be accomplished by a few nerve cells
properly hooked together but intelligence
reason ability to choose--the very essence of
brain power-require millions of nerve cells
and interconnecting paths the tiny insect
simply habnt got place for these

  insects outnumber mammals a hundred to
one as to kind they can outspeed them pro-
duce faster and develop perfectly organized
social societies survive wherevor mammals
can but they remain insects forever the
contcst botwoen the insects and the mammals
was decided millions of years ago when na-
ture decreed that insects should breathe only
through the medium of tubes-ed

synthetic pearls

editor science question box

  how can scientists tell the difference be-
tween natural and cultured pearls-l o b
kansas city kansas

  very simply-by the use of x-rays for
the past  years the x-ray lias been used to
differentiate natural from cultured pearls
if the gem is natural a uniform scattering
of the x-rays takes place when they impinge
on the specimen producing a six- or twelve-
fold spot pattern a cultured pearl simi-
larly tested on the other hand will usually
produce a maltese-cross pattern-bd
