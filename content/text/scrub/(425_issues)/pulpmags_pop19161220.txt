a fourfold game

by j frank davis

       author of   garland raiger service  ino excitement  etc

       mexico as seen through the eyes of secret agents-men who ply their
    calling in foreign lands finding adventurous hazard in their vocation and
    little reward beyond the consciousness of work well done and yet are more
    important than the accredited diplomatists who are seldom more than pawns
    in the hands of the master chessmen at home

a complete novel

chapter i

the man and the task

four men in widely distant cities
sit planning and plotting hear-
ing reports and giving com-
mands weeding analyzing col-
lating sifting in their hands are the
ends of threads that run to and fro
across all the kingdoms and republics
and principalities of the earth

  one of them is a towering man with
shoulders broad enough to bear the
weight of great burdens progressing in
years with florid face closely cropped
hair fierce upturned white mustaches
a card-index mind and a passion for
efficiency from his desk in berlin is
a far cry to tokyo where sits another
of the four-a little lean black-haired
bundle of fanatic patriotism whose
dreamy almond eyes hold no reflection
of the impetuous ambition for his coun-
trys future that burns within his soul
ib p

  a third-chieftain in this respect
within his country because he is chief-
tain in all matters being the one strong-
est man amid a swarm of weaker ones
-is younger handsome of face and
figure stern and commanding wearing
an empty sleeve where once was an
arm strong in battle he sits within the
national palace in the city of the monte-
zumas and stares with brooding bitter
gaze across the mountains to the north
beyond those mountains three thou-
sand miles away the fourth man sits
in washington and this fourth has
neither the mien nor manner of states-
man or warrior but looks and acts
and moves-albeit inconspicuously-as
might look and act and move any pros-
perous serious purposeful middle-aged
american man of business

  diplomatists all these may be and
are but not commissioned as such
nor does the army of men and women
that each commands enjoy public credit


the tpopvljltr magazine

or great honor even within their own
countries

  accredited diplomatists who serve
their nations well receive their meed of
thanks and reward and yet in these
days of fast mails and faster telegraphs
are seldom more than pawns in the
hands of the master chessmen at home
in contrast the secret agents who ply
their trade in foreign lands find ad-
venturous hazard in their vocation but
little reward beyond the consciousness
of work well done success does not
mean for them the cheers of the multi-
tude because the multitude never
knows failure may mean disgrace
it may mean death most bitterly it
may at any moment carry with it com-
plete disavowal by the nation that is
served even this they are prepared to
suffer and in the very nature of their
occupation the higher class of secret-
service men and women whatever flag
they serve are seldom pawns they
must initiate and play their own
moves

  sometimes cautiously sometimes
boldly sometimes slowly sometimes
with lightning action sometimes fear-
lessly sometimes fearfully sometimes
blithely but always secretly they go up
and down the earth and into its
farthest and most dangerous corners
playing the game of nations

  waite braxton finished his late and
solitary luncheon at a table near the
front window of roths restaurant
his check which the waiter presented
with the impressive courtesy due an ob-
viously prosperous patron totaled sev-
enty pesos and waite slipped from a
bulky wallet a fifty a twenty and a
ten-the ten constituting the waiters
tip

  lest it be thought the young amer-
ican was a gargantuan trencherman or
an extravagant fool be it said at once
that the bank notes were carranza cur-
rency valued at that moment at a small

fraction over two cents gold to the
peso translated into terms of united
states money the luncheon cost one
dollar and fifty cents the pourboire
totaled a trifle less than a quarter of a
dollar

  as the waiter bowing faded into the
middle distance braxton lighted a ciga-
rette sat back idly and through the
window let his eyes rest upon the pass-
ing throng

  it was quite surprising that the
avenida san francisco could look so
peaceful and unscarred after more
than three years of revolution piled on
revolution

  madero huerta carranza villa
zapata had come and gone and car-
ranza had come again during the swift-
speeding months since don porfirio
diaz awoke to the desperate fact that
his aging hands had lost their strength
to curb a turbulent people

  musketry had rattled and shells had
screamed through the beautiful ave-
nues and plazas of the city dictators
had risen struggled to keep their place
and fallen tattered armies had en-
tered looting and looting had de-
parted ambition had made little men
great and great men little and sent
many of them little and great together
to take their stolid turns before the
firing squads- cannon had roared and
swords had flashed and fire had burned
and there had been famine and
pestilence

  yet for all this up and down the
avenida san francisco still flowed the
afternoon procession that for years has
made it one of the fascinating thor-
oughfares of the world to a casual
observer the same procession to the
careful student a subtly different one

  waite braxton watched the chang-
ing shifting crowds and compared
them with the crowds of other days

  he knew mexico city he had been
there many times-when diazs hand
was iron when maderos dreams were
a poucrfolv game



straw he hid been there in febru-
ary  when the younger diaz and
reyes sprang their revolt to be fol-
lowed so speedily by the treacherous
coup of blanquet and huerta which
sent don panchito the weak and don
gustavo the strong to pay the price of
power taxed against the house of
madero

  the last time he had sat here in the
window of roths and watched the
passing swarm he recalled there had
been a sudden fanfare of bugles scat-
tering of vehicles and pedestrians a
galloping whirl of cavalrymen cheers
and a rolling automobile in the tonneau
of which sat a short squat uniformed
stone-faced indian with a wide thin
cruel mouth-victoriano huerta then
more automobiles more soldiers more
cheers and the dictator was gone

  and only a few months later huerta
was gone indeed-as diaz had gone as
villa was to go and zapata as car-
ranza also wrould sooner or later go
and who could tell what procession of
others before the coming of a ruler
strong enough to rule

  that scene in the late spring of 
came back to braxton and it was dif-
ficult to realize that three other chief-
tains in the intervening time had been
cheered along the avenue it might be
the same scene this afternoon-almost
only one very familiar with the city in
the old days he thought could see a
difference now

  up and down the street rolled auto-
mobiles and carriages bearing beautiful
women in paris-made frocks along
the sidewalks strolled frock-coated
high-hatted men gloved swinging
sticks in the gutters moving at the
queer untiring dogtrot of the mexican
indian swung along noiselessly the
never-ending procession of barefooted
or sandaled pelados their shocks of
coarse hair hanging over dull lack-
luster eyes bands about their fore-
heads packs of incredible heaviness

upon their backs-bearers of burdens
in a country where man is the cheapest
of all beasts

  back and forth flowed the river of
deep contrasts that ever has fascinated
the looker-on in mexico city a stream
of the very rich in the middle and on
the banks and of the very poor like
some muddy copper-colored back-
water slipping along between the two

  the clear high-altitude sun shone
down on the picture throwing all the
color of it into sharp relief it touched
the immaculate street-perhaps the
only main thoroughfare in the world
that is literally washed and scrubbed
by hand-and the magnificent facades
of ornate buildings it threw its light
alike upon the glittering contents of
the plate-glass windows upon the
fashionable raiment in carriage and on
sidewalk and upon the filth and sordid
poverty and hopelessness of the indi-
ans who swung past their eyes upon
the ground

  this describes the avenida san
francisco on that afternoon in late
february  when waite braxton
sat idly smoking in roths restaurant
thus far it could as well pass for a de-
scription of the avenida san francisco
on any pleasant week-day afternoon
five years or more ago but braxtons
eyes comprehended the change

  the shop windows glistened but
with contents less expensive than be-
fore  offering as small a temptation to
loot as was consistent with necessary
display and decoration the automo-
biles and carriages were fewer and less
well kept the horses were thin and
shaggy the prosperous pedestrians
and carriage folk taken as a whole did
not look quite so prosperous as afore-
time and there were not so many of
them the efficient little policemen
swaggered as bravely as ever but in
frayed and ragged uniforms

  when one came to analyze it only
the backwater stream of poverty-


the popular magazine

stricken pelados had not changed
they had become no richer they could
become no poorer there is some com-
pensation perhaps for being of the
very bottom dreg of society he who
sleeps on the floor says an old adage
cannot fall out of bed

  braxton saw the passing throng and
considered it but even while he looked
at the moving procession he was look-
ing through it his mind busy with the
task that had brought him again to
mexico city

  barely three weeks since the chief
had summoned him from new york to
washington this of itself was a rare
occurrence in all the six years he
had been connected with the secret
service he had visited headquarters not
more than a dozen times he could
count on his fingers and toes the num-
ber of people in the united states
including secret-service officials who
knew him to be a servant of the gov-
ernment the success with which this
incognito had been maintained had not
a little to do with his value to the
service

  the chief had given him succinct
comprehensive orders the talk lasted
nearly an hour but its substance could
be summed up in sixteen words

  learn the contents of the note car-
ranza is about to send by special mes-
senger to japan

  a task certainly involving both dif-
ficulty and risk a task the chief
thought braxton stood the best chance
of accomplishing not only because he
had often succeeded where others had
failed but because his generally ac-
cepted position as a scion of wealth
more or less interested in the handling
of certain corporate inheritances fur-
nished him the logical excuse to do
certain things that done by other
agents of the department would arouse
prompt suspicion

  there is a limit to what bribery will
accomplish even in mexico said the

chief not more than a half dozen
people i suppose know what is going
into this note or what has gone into it
if it is already prepared carranza and
obregon of course-it might be more
proper to say obregon and carranza-
and the foreign minister and two or
three subordinates in his department
probably although not necessarily
some of the other members of the cab-
inet payne says- you know

payne quite well dont you

  intimately we were in the same
class at harvard

  payne reports that in his opinion
the men closest to carranza and likely
to be aware of the contents of this
japanese note would prove incor-
ruptible if approached by any one who
they thought might represent this gov-
ernment mexican officials may not be
very strong patriots as we understand
the word but they certainly all agree
in their hatred of the american gov-
ernment so while there may be men
on the inside-probably are-who for
a sufficient consideration would let slip
the secret in some quarters they would
want to feel sure that those quarters
did not represent washington

  you would suggest

  the same tactics as when you were
there in 

  universal oil

  exactly you are already identified
in the minds of some mexicans as a
representative of universal oil and
universal oil has had its finger in some
of the internal affairs of mexico dur-
ing the past four years there are
mexican patriots who would hesitate a
long time before selling a secret to the
american government who wouldnt
pause a moment if they thought they
were giving their information merely to
that corporation they take it for
granted that universal oil does not run
to the president with what news it
gets

  braxton allowed himself a moments
a foucrpqud game



digression from the immediate business
in hand

  it is odd he said how firmly the
public is convinced of my connection
with the universal considering that i
dont own a share of that stock and
never did

  an illustration the chief replied
of what a newspaper reputation can
do your father is a director of the
equity trust the equity trust has
a community of interest with universal
oil you travel to and fro seemingly
an idler yet sufficiently alert and active
so that it appears hardly probable you
have no business interests also it
would hardly be expected that your fa-
thers son should wastehis time the
newspapers which cannot overlook any
of the activities of the rich guess that
perhaps you are concerned with the in-
side affairs of the universal the uni-
versal does not deny it because it never
denies anything so the myth grows
and grows until to-day you are brax-
ton the universal oil man and i
must say it has proven a very valuable
asset to the service that reputation of
yours

  the queer thing is that on more
than one occasion in this work i have
run up against secret agents of the
universal and they have never seemed
to know for certain that i was not also
one of them

  the companys policy of never let-
ting its right hand know how many
fingers on its left hand are closed it
is the same policy that we in the serv-
ice follow sometimes-in your own
case for instance how surprised some
of our men who know you quite well
without suspecting your real business
would be if they should learn that you
are also an agent of the department
of all those now at work south of the
rio grande for instance only one i
think-payne-is aware of your real
position

  none other that i recall-or at

least that i know is now working in
mexico

  no none of our people now south
of the border except payne ever heard
of you in connection with this office
let us hope we may be able to keep our
relations as close a secret for the next
five or six years as we have been able
to during the past five or six of
course the time might come on any
case when you would have to give the
big distress sign in a place where other
agents were present that happened
once as i recall it

  yes in manila the number who
know my connection with the depart-
ment was increased that night by
three

  and all of them were promptly
warned to forget-and promptly for-
got

  braxtons mind reviewed the near-
tragedy with himself as the principal
participant to which the chief had re-
ferred after a moment he came back
to the subject in hand

  as to cost-on this japanese-note

  whatever is necessary we must
know what carranza is saying to japan
if it is humanly possible provide
plenty of money universal oil is ex-
pected to be shrewd but not niggardly

  and you think it possible that car-
ranza is proposing to japan that in the
event of trouble on this continent she

  lets not think about it at all we
might be right and we might be wrong
and in either event thinking would do
us no good if we didnt know if it
means the same as the special trip to
japan gustavo madero was planning
wrhen huerta gave him ley fuega-you
know what was in the wind then-we
want to know it if it means something
else innocent or not we want to know
that we must have a copy of that
note if it can be secured you can sail
for vera cruz to-morrow

  a few odds and ends of detail a dis-


the cpocpular magazine

cussion of finances and the chief rose
and shook hands

  dont trust the telegraph were his
last words of warning we cannot
tell what cipher codes of ours may be
in their hands you know for that
matter there are mighty few codes of
any government that are not in the pos-
session of most or all the others it
may be by the way that you will get
this mex-japanese message in code of
some sort if so bring it along as it is
and dont worry unless it is perfectly
easy to get a translation as well we
can probably decode it here or at the
state department if there is any cipher
in use by the mexicans that payne
hasnt sent along during the past three
years he doesnt know of its existence
good luck

  he threw open the door to the outer
office thank you for calling mr
braxton he said in a formal cour-
teous voice that carried to the nearest
clerks i shall have the matter looked
into at the very earliest possible mo-
ment

  a fortnight in mexico city and now
it seemed the task was almost com-
pleted unless some detail in the plans
he and leroy payne had so carefully
put into execution should fail the se-
cret note would be in his hands within
twenty-four or at the latest forty-
eight hours

chapter ii

muerta los gringos

  he looked at his watch an hour yet
before his appointment to meet payne
at the american club he rose took
his hat and stick from the waiter and
went out upon the avenue

  as he strolled toward the zocolo
newsboys came running down the
street they were shouting raucously
pedestrians stopped to buy their pa-
pers carriage folk also pulled up to
the walk to purchase an extra brax-

ton noted of the most rabid and sensa-
tional anti-american daily in the city

  he bought a copy and spread it open
across the top of the first page in type
whose size and blackness would have
done credit to any yellow newspaper in
the world new york not excepted was
a line

americanos preparando para
invadir mexico

  the dispatch that furnished the ex-
cuse for the black headline he saw at
a glance did not warrant the caption
it was to the effect that texas gringos
were preparing to cross the rio grande
at juarez piedras negras and nueva
laredo and it was dated from saltillo
which not only would be unlikely to
hear of any contemplated invasion be-
fore other points but throughout all
the revolutions has been a prime source
of -fictitious war rumors

  mexico city he at once observed
was hysterical and easily excited the
extra sold quickly those who read it
passed on the news by word of
mouth there were mutterings and
gesticulations a condition might easily
arise that could become very unpleas-
ant for americans

  he did not think of this as having
much bearing on himself of medium
height with black hair and eyes and a
tongue that rattled spanish idioms as
rapidly and correctly as though they
were english there was little chance
of his attracting attention on the street
as a gringo on more than one occa-
sion he had been in swirling yankee-
hating latin crowds without feeling in
danger or being in danger he could
easily pass for a spaniard had done so
a dozen times he felt therefore
safely detached from the current of ex-
citement that was pulsating through the
throng

  idly walking he paused a moment
before a jewelers window and amused
himself by noting the seemingly ex-
a foutrfqud game



orbitant prices made necessary by the
depreciation of carranza currency a
sudden shout of warning somewhere
close behind him made him turn
quickly just in time to witness a street
accident of a kind not rare in any great
city

  a mexican of the peon class had
started to cross the street in the mid-
dle of the block dodging among the
fast-moving vehicles

  a cabriolet of the characteristic mex-
ican style-wide enough to seat three
passengers with a pair of horses not
educated to trot-was speeding past
the whip-swinging driver probably
spurred by financial inducements to
reach his destination in a hurry mex-
ican speed regulations for drivers are
admirably simple being in effect
drive at any speed you please and
on either side of the street you please
and around corners in any direction
you please-but always bearing in mind
that whenever an accident occurs all
the parties to it will be arrested im-
mediately and punished including the
victim

  the peons attention had been dis-
tracted in another direction or he failed
to gauge correctly the fast approach of
the racing horses as the warning
went up from a dozen spectators the
pair was upon him the driver threw
his weight on the reins but the feet
of the horses slid

  what the peon did was lithe and
quick as an indian might be expected
to act realizing he could not get out
of the way he turned placed both
hands on the nearer horses breast and
let the momentum of the animals ad-
vance throw him to one side this
presence of mind would have saved him
injury had not a big touring car at that
moment started to pass the cabriolet

  the indian saw the oncoming auto-
mobile but could not regain his bal-
ance he tried to whirl himself out
of the way as the driver of the car

threw on his emergency brakes and
failed the car struck him knocked
him down and dragged him several
feet

  police efficiency one governmental
thing that is usually wrorthy of com-
mendation in mexico city came rapidly
into play

  one policeman had been in sight at
the street crossing a hundred feet away 
three more materialized from nowhere
in particular within the next minute

  of this quartet one arrested the
driver of the cabriolet ordered its pas-
sengers to alight pay their fares to that
moment and depart about their busi-
ness and settled himself in the cab with
a curt command that he be driven to
the nearest police station another
made memoranda of the number of the
automobile and the names of its oc-
cupants and ordered them all to ap-
pear before officialdom a third swag-
gered in the middle of the street driv-
ing the accumulating crowd back to the
sidewalks and straightened out the
jamming traffic in a jiffy the fourth
pursued the scratched and bruised in-
dian who had rolled and crawled to the
sidewalk and was making shift to hob-
ble away placed him under arrest and
started him limping toward a cell

  with these four things accomplished
-and not three minutes was needed to
complete them all-the crowd brought
its collective eye back to the spot where
stood the two erstwhile occupants of
the cab their luggage at their ifeet peer-
ing out to discover a vacant carriage
and fuming at the delay

  they were an elderly man with white
hair and a younger one with reddish
hair and the crowd took them for
americans

  thus rich yanquis trample on the
poor called a voice far enough back
in the press that its owner was reason-
ably certain to escape the remaining po-
licemans eye

  rich americanos gringos they


the vovulfltr magazine

trample on the poor the sentence
spread from mouth to mouth a more
daring mexican shouted half-heartedly
as though willing to take it back if un-
supported 

  mnerta los gringos death to the
gringos

  the cry was taken up by others less
half-heartedly

  mnerta los americanos ajuerta
los gringos

  the policeman was at the side of the
two men who saw the threatening peril
the elder addressed him in passable
spanish

  we are british subjects my son and
i we are leaving the city we wish a
carriage

  thie shouts of the crowd were gather-
ing volume the crowd itself was being
steadily augmented braxton was jos-
tled from his position before the jewel-
ers window by two men probably the
proprietor and a clerk who had come
running out of the store and now set to
work quickly to pull down and lock the
heavy metal shutters provided to pro-
tect the show windows in just such an
emergency other shutters in the
neighborhood he noticed were already
closing with an alacrity that testified to
recent practice with street mobs and
appreciation of how speedily they can
go into action

  only the little policeman seemed
oblivious to the gathering danger
often in less turbulent days braxton
had admired the fine efficiency of the
undersized underpaid mexico city po-
lice  again he felt appreciation of their
calm assurance in time of trouble

  the officer spoke a sharp reassuring
sentence to the englishmen he turned
and faced the crowd quietly almost
jauntily

  back he commanded sharply to
those crowding in the gutter they fell
over themselves and milled muttering
and threatening to either side

  he raised his left hand in signal to an

approaching cab containing one male
passenger his right hand rested lightly
on the butt of his revolver which hangs
in plain sight outside the uniform
blouse

  the cab stopped there is room
for two more passengers the police-
man ordered take them quickly to
their hotel or station you do not ob-
ject he half queried the well-dressed
mexican in the carriage

  certainly not let us hasten in the
name of the saints 

  the englishmen threw their bags
into the cab and fellover them to places
on the wide seat beside the mexican
the driver whipped up his horses the
little policeman a sneering smile curl-
ing his lips his hand still resting lightly
on his pistol waved contemptuously
with his left hand to the crowd to dis-
perse

  at exactly this moment two doors
down the avenue a girl came out of a
little store the window of which was
filled with embroidery and laces she
must have been ignorant of the disturb-
ance else surely she would not have
faced it she came out saw the swirl-
ing disappointed mob and turned
quickly to reenter the store but the
proprietor who had accompanied her
to the entrance becoming suddenly
aware of the danger most ungallantly
slammed the door locked it and pulled
down an interior iron screen

  braxton saw that she was obviously
an american well dressed and good to
look at and that her hair was reddish
gold more than this he had no time
to note for the angry crowd cheated a
moment before and having had time to
think that after all there was only one
policeman present surged toward her
again sounded the bay of the hounds

  mnerta los gringos

  they had swung in twenty deep be-
tween the policeman and the girl and
the little officer was pushing and shov-
ing snarling and threatening bravely
a fourfoud game



enough to get to her side but making
small headway in the crush he got out
his whistle and blew it shrilly al-
ready however braxton had leaped in
front of the girl who had her back
against a building facing the hooting
crowd with white face but a stout
bravery in her bearing that won a flash
of admiration from braxtons subcon-
scious mind his conscious mind was
busy with the problem of how best to
help the girl without getting himself
into a police tangle he reasoned in
the second or two it took him to reach
the girls side that she was probably in
danger of no greater harm than in-
sulting words help would come in
time to prevent actual violence a
street crowd in mexico is necessarily
unarmed except for the matter of
small knives and police reinforce-
ments would be on hand shortly he
need not really mix into the situation

  thus he reasoned then he acted in
direct opposition to his reasoning

  he swung a hard fist into a dirty face
that was grimacing too close to the
shrinking girl and as the owner of the
face went toppling held himself ready
to repeat the dose as indicated by the
necessities of the case

  keep away hombres he shouted
authoritatively in his perfect spanish
you are mistaken this lady is no
gringo but english i myself know
her she is my friend and my familys
friend

  what does he say they asked on
the outskirts of the crowd

  who is it that shouted demanded
one shorter man who was running
about the outskirts vainly trying to see

  the gentleman he has the man-
ner of a general

  what is it asked others what
is it

  dont you hear the general says
she is not a gringo 

  viva general shouted somebody

many in the crowd caught up the cry
it is unsafe not to viva a general
one who failed to cheer might find him-
self under suspicion of having taken
part in the riot against the generals
friend

  they had begun to cheer and to fall
back as the little policeman more
ragged of uniform than before tore
through the last restraining wall of hu-
manity that separated him from brax-
ton and the girl he had caught the
cry of general the crowd seem-
ingly had recognized a celebrity with
whose face he was not yet familiar
after all there are many generals

  braxton smiled down upon the of-
ficer and spoke a word of commenda-
tion such as a military man under such
circumstances might have given a po-
liceman he did something even more
to the point when he slipped into the
officers hand two bank notes each
bearing the denomination of one hun-
dred pesos even in united states
money they were worth four dollars
and the policemans lot in mexico city
is neither a happy nor a prosperous one

  a sharp bark of command at the back
of the crowd and it opened widened
and let through a trotting half hundred
soldiers at their head was a young
captain pale-faced clean-shaven neatly
uniformed with shining teeth and
manicured hands the uniforms of the
fifty who followed him were tattered
and most of the men were barefoot but
they were seasoned fighters-mexico
city gets the veterans of the armies of
mexico-and their guns were held in
a manner that denoted they would
willingly use them

  the pale-faced young captain looked
quickly from the policeman to braxton
and the girl

  it is over these people were ex-
cited and thought the lady was a gringo
she is of the english the policeman
made the explanation rapidly she is
a friend of the general


the popular magazine

  before the-captain could reply brax-
ton spoke smilingly yet with authority
your name captain

  francisco garcia

  thank you i shall see your prompt
arrival is reported where it may help
you and now-he turned to the girl
-we will proceed

  the captain who also realized that
no one could be expected to know all
the dignitaries of a shifting government
even by sight saluted returning the
salute and smiling courteously at cap-
tain and policeman braxton took the
girls arm and walked briskly along the
sidewalk the crowd beginning to dis-
perse paid little attention to him or his
charge already the captain was giv-
ing sharp commands and the soldiers
were falling in to patter back to what
place of vantage near the center was
being used as their barracks

  throughout all the scene the girl had
not spoken now as they drew out
of earshot of the policeman braxton
asked

  where shall i take you we had
better go there quickly before anything
else gets started

  the girl flashed a look of surprise
at him it had not occurred to her
any more than to the other participants
in the incident that he was not a mex-
ican she had not heard him speak ex-
cept in spanish

  i am stopping with relatives at the
hotel presidente

  we will leave the avenue at the next
street i dont always introduce my-
self as informally as this my name is
braxton-waite braxton

  an american 

  guilty

  but your spanish accent they
were perfectly sure you were a mex-
ican i speak the language  was cer-
tain

  complexion tan and a boyhood
partly spent in spain the combination
makes it easy to deceive really no

credit to me at all we might go
through here to the avenida dieziseis
de septiembre

  as they briskly crossed the avenue
and turned in the side street braxton
without seeming to stare gained his
first comprehensive look at his com-
panion his first impression that she
was rather good to look upon was
heightened by this survey she was he
thought extremely restful to the eye

  she was fairly tall of trim and
rounded figure and with a swing to
her carriage that led him shrewdly to
guess she could play tennis and per-
haps ride and swim well about
twenty-four he judged her to be which
would make her five years his junior
her thick hair as he had already noted
approvingly was a dark gold full of
glints of red and the cheek that was
within range of his vision was of that
peculiar creamy whiteness that some-
times goes with hair of that tinge

  he had not seen her eyes what
color were they he wondered blue
probably or gray he decided upon
gray they ought to be gray any-
how

  i havent thanked you she was
saying  dont think i do not appre-
ciate it

  he laughed lightly as a matter of
fact he said i dont think you were
in any real danger the little captain
and his soldiers were there almost as
soon as i was

  it was dangerous enough she re-
plied perhaps they wouldnt have
hurt me much but having ones clothes
torn or being pushed about by dirty
handed pelados would not be especially
pleasant

  it was a singularly cool attitude to-
ward her recent predicament most
girls-even self-reliant american girls
-would be on the verge of hysteria
after so harrowing an experience he
eyed her admiringly
a fourfoud game

ii

 you have nerve miss- he

hadnt intended this as a hint that he
did not know her name and hesitated
a bit embarrassed

  lynde she supplied it shows my
self-possession isnt as good as you
think that i havent told you before
esther lynde my home is in wash-
ington are you a virginia braxton
we are a branch of the virginia
family my people have lived in new
york several generations however

  the girl suddenly turned her eyes to
him he rather thought they were
grayish blue i think i have read of
you in the newspapers she said you
travel a great deal dont you you are
connected with-is it universal oil 
a man cannot hide his identity these
days he laughed even under black
hair a tanned skin and a spanish
vocabulary

  they approached the open entrance
of the hotel presidente i should like
to have my cousins meet you-mr and
mrs carson they also will want to
thank you for what you did she said
but they are out this afternoon

  if i might call he murmured
  really theres nothing else to do

 nothing-er-

  doesnt the rescuer of a maiden in
distress always call afterward you
couldnt stay away it would be con-
trary to all tradition

  i knew it was that way in books
but there are so many things in books
that arent so so the custom obtains
in real life

  the best authorities agree it does
you can bear it in mind the next time
you go knight-erranting she added

  my excuse for ignorance is that i
have been lacking in opportunities he
said earnestly i shall never overlook
them again

  they were in the lobby and she gave
him her hand and spoke seriously

  at about half after eight then she

said and i am truly deeply grate-
ful

  he decided her eyes were bluish
gray

chapter iii

under four flags

  leroy payne sat before the roll-top
desk in his inner office on the third
floor of a centrally located business
block in the outer room a -stenog-
rapher of mixed blood able to take dic-
tation very competently in spanish and
very shockingly in english read a
novel and from time to time patted her
hair complacently stenographers being
stenographers wherever their habitat

  the outer door bore the announce-
ment in spanish that leroy payne
was the mexican representative of the
new york-mexico development com-
pany making a specialty of selling
mexican lands and of managing them
in the interests of united states own-
ers such an occupation gave him the
opportunity to do many things along
lines of investigation without attract-
ing attention or arousing suspicion he
could always decline clients on the
ground that their work would conflict
with other interests by which he al-
ready had been retained

  investigation in new york if any
one ever desired to make it would
demonstrate that mr payne was a
graduate of harvard law school a
lawyer authorized to practice in the
courts of new york and the vice presi-
dent of a real corporation with offices
in lower broadway the investigation
would not have brought out however
the additional fact that major sim-
mons the corporations president was
also a valued agent of the secret service

  there had been enough bona-fide
business conducted by the office in past
days to cloak its real operations and
while it was true that since the pro-
cession of mexican revolutions mr
payne had bought no new lands for his


the pocpular magazine

american clients he nevertheless had
ample excuse for remaining on the job
in mexico in that things had happened
on lands whose owners he already rep-
resented calling for negotiations with
the various governments as they held
power

  mr payne on this spring afternoon
seemed no busier in his inner office than
was his stenographer in her outer one

  he was a short thickset good-na-
tured-looking young man with thinning
light hair faint beginnings of what in
middle age undoubtedly would be a
double chin and spectacles with tor-
toise-shell rims not at all a man who
would be picked in a crowd as the se-
cret agent of anybody

  he sat tipped back in his desk chair
his eyes fixed thoughtfully on a spot in
the sky some miles beyond the glisten-
ing dome of the national opera house
he was not thinking of the graft that
has left the massive marble structure
half finished although something like
twice the necessary amount for its com-
pletion has been appropriated and
spent nor of the great crack in its pol-
ished walls that an unusually heavy
earthquake caused nor of the national
opera house at all he was not even
thinking of that distant spot in the sky
beyond at which he stared his mind
was over in the national palace on the
zocolo and he was wondering what a
certain stout dark-skinned black-
bearded assistant in the department of
foreign affairs was doing at this exact
moment the gentleman in mind one
florencio calderon by name and colo-
nel by rank had promised if all went
well to call him by telephone at four
oclock and it was now well past that
hour

  the telephone bell tinkled in the
outer office and a second later there
was a tap on his door and the stenog-
rapher opened it the telephone
senor she said

  bueno he called into the receiver
the voice of colonel calderon replied

  there would be no secrets told over
the line for paynes stenographer prob-
ably was listening in his outer room
and the switchboard operator in the na-
tional palace might be plugged in with
nobody knew how many others all
this however had been provided for

  i am colonel calderon came over
the wire in spanish

  yes colonel how is your health
very good thank you i have on
my desk a letter from you senor
payne asking information regarding
the unpaid back taxes assessed by the
government against certain lands in
tamaulipas whose owners you repre-
sent

  yes

  i have compiled the figures if we
could have a brigf talk i feel sure i
could make the justice of the clainl
clear to you

  at your convenience colonel

  you are anxious for the informa-
tion quickly your letter says

  as soon as you can find it possible
senor

  yes well i have it for you i am
to be detained here at the palace for
some time but if you could find it con-
venient to meet me this evening-

  the pleasure will be mine

  as my family is out of the city i
am stopping temporarily at the hotel
presidente could you call--and at
what hour

  any hour you suggest

  suppose we say quarter of nine
or a little after you might come right
up if you vwill room no  it is
on the third floor

  thank you between quarter of
nine and nine

  adios senor
  adios mi coronel 

  payne permitted himself a sigh of
relief and a smile he looked at his
watch took his hat and stick told the
a fourfoud game



stenographer he was going for the day
and set forth in the direction of the
american club

  waite braxton was already seated in
a corner of the lounge when he entered
no other members or guests were
within earshot

  the two men shook hands as though
meeting by accident for the benefit of
eyes that might be watching and payne
accepted braxtons invitation to be
seated with him and drink something
cooling not until the waiter had
brought the drinks and departed did
they refer to the purpose of their
meeting

  calderon phoned o k said
payne

  he has it

  evidently he said he had the in-
formation i requested i am to meet
him at the presidente to-night room
no  for some reason he does not
want me to come to either the palace
or his house afraid of spies i sup-
pose well heres to broadway
youll be seeing the old street again
within a fortnight i wish i could

  braxton set down his glass and
smoked for a moment thoughtfully

  it will be in code he said cal-
deron has no way of getting access to
the key without letting others in on it
which he thought would be too danger-
ous also he would have had to split

  how did you happen to arrange that
he should give the message to me in-
stead of to you yourself i didnt think
to ask you sunday when you were tell-
ing me of the conference

  it was his suggestion-partially
he said obregon trusted nobody fully
--that no attache of the government
knew when he was being spied upon
he had already met me once and he
feared if he did so again he might fall
under suspicion of course he is per-
fectly sure i am representing the uni-
versal oil company in the matter al-
though neither he nor i mentioned the

company by name you see there
doesnt happen to be any official matter
in his department that he could use as
an excuse if he were asked to explain
what business he and i had

  so he asked me if there wasnt any
one in the city that i could trust to act
as a messenger-some one writh whom
the department had had correspondence
or negotiations i thought it over care-
fully and suggested you saying wre
were personal acquaintances and i
knew you to be a trustworthy man and
that i thought you would be willing to
act for me the interests that you rep-
resent not being in any sense counter to
those with which i am connected he
fell for this immediately saying you
would be just the man because some-
body or other had engaged you to file a
kick about the new carranza tax levies
on lands and that a meeting with you
would therefore be easy to explain

  its exasperating that i couldnt put
this thing through myself said payne
but i told the chief in the report wil-
liams carried out a month ago that the
japanese note was coming and i didnt
believe i could get hold of it calderon
was about the only man we stood a
chance of getting to and while i feel
sure neither he nor any other official
suspects my connection with the gov-
ernment the companies i represent are
not big enough or sufficiently con-
cerned with international affairs to be
buying important secrets for their own
use universal oil is something dif-
ferent it is expected to take a hand
in all mexican developments and
right or not most mexicans would not
expect the universal to be especially
patriotic

  universal oil has come to be a big
machine said braxton gravely a
corporation has no soul and yet i be-
lieve most big business men are at heart
just as patriotic as anybody else my
father is a holder of securities in a
great many corporations but if such a


the popular magazine

note as we presume this japanese mes-
sage to be were to come into his hands
i know he would take the first train to
washington with it absolutely without
regard to- what the effect might be on
his personal fortune

  i have often wondered if it isnt
too personal how much your father
knows about your occupation waite
and what he thinks about it

  he knows all about it that is to
say he knows i am in the service
what i do he never asks and of
course i never tell him as to what he
thinks about it he objected seriously
enough when i first went into the work
it seemed to him-well perhaps the
word is undignified and thankless
he said and ofifering no future but i
argued that i did not need a future
in the money-making sense and that
the work was certainly no more undig-
nified than picking up information in
devious ways about rival banks and cor-
porations and that a young man in my
position with a love of travel and a
taste for a little adventure might do
worse than serve his country

  so he ceased to oppose you

  i was of age he said and he would
not stand in my way do you know i
have always fancied the old man is
rather-well proud of me hes a
pretty hard man in business and they
call him bull braxton because of the
way he roars down opposition-but
they dont know him as i do and you
may remember that a braxton signed
the declaration of independence

  i notice you didnt include in his
reasons for objecting the fact that our
trade is sometimes a little dangerous
i imagine from what i have heard of
your father he wouldnt consider that
his war record was a fairly good
one replied braxton with a note of
pride in his voice

  speaking of danger do you expect
to go back to the states alone

  yes

  that would be a pretty hazardous
trip if some of our little slant-eyed
brethren were to get wise to what you
were carrying

  youre certainly right theyre a
thorough little people are there many
of their secret-service men here just
now 

  payne shrugged his shoulders who
can spot a jap in government service
tell me if you can the total japanese
population of mexico city and ill
guarantee the total of japanese spies
isnt any greater than that further
than that deponent saith not

  let us trust they get no line on us
nevertheless i promise to keep my
eyes open all the way home for urbane
little yellow men i may ask you to
ride down to vera cruz with me so
there can be a pair of us in case of
trouble once out of mexico i think
i can look out for myself what time
is your appointment with calderon
quarter of nine or thereabouts i
suppose hell have the copy ready to
hand over in a hurry do i pay him 
what arrangement did you make
on the spot thank goodness he
doesnt insist upon gold and i have the
necessary cashiers check i brought
several to fit various prices and con-
tingencies the colonel must be salt-
ing money in the states he made no
objection whatever to getting it that
way ill hand you the check in my
room when we go to dinner

  and id like to see you as soon as
possible after the meeting and turn the
papers over i hate to have the - re-
sponsibility for them a minute longer
than it will take to pass the buck to
you

 shall we say here at eleven
oclock

  all right where are you going to
be earlier in the evening if i should
need to get you

  by a peculiar coincidence at eight-
thirty i am to be at the hotel presi-
a fourfoud game



dente i have a call to make there-
purely social

  payne may have looked curious i
met a young lady who is stopping there
this afternoon braxton explained
miss esther lynde know her
paynes face registered interest
why yes he said if you dont
mind braxton who is miss lynde 

  i dont get you is there anything
-peculiar-about her

  not peculiar mysterious perhaps
i thought you said you knew her
no i met her for the first time
this afternoon very sketchily and
without taking as much credit upon
himself as payne felt sure he was en-
tiled to he recounted the circum-
stances

  then you cannot relieve my curi-
osity said payne i rather hoped
you could tell me who the young lady
is and why she should visit mexico
city at a moment when most americans
with sense-especially young good-
looking unattached ones-are making
tracks to get out

  then she hasnt been here long
two or three weeks i should say
perhaps a month i have met her at
various places dinners and such
very attractive well traveled fluent
linguist guarded by mr carson and
mrs carson who are-just mr car-
son and mrs carson guard of honor
for miss lynde but i dont know
anybody who knows any more about
her than i do he hesitated unless
it might be von arnoldt he added

 von arnoldt captain von ar-
noldt  the-

  uh-huh you know him i see
we had a bit of a run-in two or
three years ago in buenos aires but
he never knew my participation in it
what is he doing here 

  keeping his eyes open as usual i
have my personal ideas that he has been
doing some underground work in con-

nection with this japanese note but
just what you can figure as well as i
it depends on germanys position and
we dont know what that is

  for six weeks it has been common
gossip on the inside that carranza-or
obregon-was getting ready to dispatch
a special ambassador to tokyo with an
important note general valdez is the
ambassador and he and hfs brass-
bound staff left last saturday for new
york en route to japan that rumor
proved true there has been another
rumor that important negotiations are
in progress with germany and that
some sort of a note is to be sent there
also this may be true and it may
not no ambassador has been ap-
pointed of that we are sure so we
do not know positively that there is to
be a note to germany and if there is
we certainly do not know whether it is
to be along similar lines to that sent
japan

  now figuring that von arnoldt
has something to do with this particular
situation we have three guesses-one
about as likely to be correct as an-
other

  if germany is to get a similar note
to the japanese message perhaps von
arnoldt came here to receive it obre-
gon might not want to send a special
messenger to germany openly with the
submarine issue still hanging fire be-
tween berlin and washington sec-
ond  if germany is behind the japanese
notes as is entirely possible perhaps
he came here to steer the working of it
third guess if the notes are not on
the same subject or if they are sup-
posed to be similar but germany is
afraid of the well-known and justly
celebrated mexican double cross maybe
von arnoldt is on the same errand that
you are-trying to get a copy of the
tokyo letter so there you are

  nominally he arrived in mexico
city five or six weeks ago to represent
some german mining interests that have


the mvulatr magazine

a concession in southern coahuila he
is just plain herr arnoldt-isnt using
either the von or the captain by-
george i dont envy him one way it
must be embarrassing these days for
a german who is serving his country
under cover like that not to be able to
explain why he is staying away from
home with so much fighting going on

  but what makes you think von ar-
noldt might know more than other
people about miss lynde

  nothing really except that they are
together considerably he pays her a
good deal of attention and she seems
to like to be in his company nothing
in the slightest degree unconventional
you understand even by continental
standards perhaps it is merely that
they are congenial she speaks ger-
man like a native lived in berlin some
time i believe and von arnoldt is
a very able person i fancy he at-
tracts most women when he sets out
to

  braxton inspected an accidental
smoke ring that was ascending from
his cigar

  she mentioned that her home is in
washington

  yes that also led me to won-
der- payne laughed shortly

lord braxton what suspicious
minds this game of ours develops
here is a pretty american girl who
hasnt seen fit to take us into her con-
fidence-having met you for ten min-
utes and me for perhaps an hour and
a half in the aggregate she associates
in an entirely proper wray with a ger-
man secret-service man we have no
reason to think she is aware he is in
the service in fact for all i know you
and i may be the only living souls in
mexico outside the german diplomats
who do know it she lives in wash-
ington which contains a few hundred
spies and three hundred and thirty
thousand other people so we begin to
wonder if perhaps she isnt connected

in some manner with our own interest-
ing profession

  suspecting everybody has served us
all well more than once maintained
braxton but you are right it can
be carried too far miss lynde did not
impress me as being at all that sort if
you know what i mean no i should
hardly believe it

  nor i replied payne i certainly
have nothing on which to base any such
belief i was only-wondering

 braxton blew a cloud of smoke to-
ward the ceiling

  i never liked that fellow von ar-
noldt  he said

chapter iv

on the third floor

  at eight-thirty to the minute waite
braxton sauntered from the street
into the hotel presidente and re-
quested a clerk to send his card up to
miss lynde he took a seat near the
desk not far from the bulletin board
upon which is posted for all who run
to read the names of all occupants of
rooms in the hotel

  he noticed as he passed the board
that the name of colonel calderon ap-
peared there assigned to room no 
presumably the colonel could have ex-
ercised his governmental pull to avoid
the operation of this police regulation
if he had wished he was protecting
himself by apparent frankness

  casually glancing at the other names
braxton observed that f arnoldt of
mannheim was also registered as a
guest the german was assigned to
room no  on the fourth floor

  like most mexican buildings public
or otherwise the hotel presidente was
built around a patio or central court
which in its case was covered with
glass and formed the main lobby of
the hotel standing in the center of the
lobby one could look up at the huge
skylights five stories above and on all
a foufolv game



sides the court was surrounded by bal-
conies off three of which opened
rooms the fourth side was occupied
in the middle by the elevator and on
either side by a staircase that circled
about it

  on each floor on the side opposite
the elevator and stairs-that is to say
toward the front of the building-the
balcony was very deep and was pro-
vided with a library table and easy-
chairs while about the walls filling the
spaces between doors opening into
guests rooms were cushioned seats
these balcony spaces served as the
public parlors of the house

  the ground floor of the presidente
had but one entrance-the front not
only the guests and the employees and
the servants but the groceries the pro-
visions and the coal came in through
that main entrance which possessed a
door of oak and steel that could be shut
and barred at a moments notice mak-
ing of the hotel with its thick walls
and high barred ground-floor win-
dows something very like a fortress
such construction is not unusual in
latin countries where street riots are
always to be reckoned with in mexico
city it is the rule rather than the ex-
ception

  braxton who hadnever been in the
presidente more than three or four
times noted these things as he waited
for the page to return

  the boy came back promptly and re-
ported to the desk at the clerks sig-
nal braxton rose

  miss lynde said the clerk will
be down to the second floor in a few
minutes will you be good enough to
wait there the boy will show you
he added apologetically  i regret you
will have to walk up the stairs our
elevator had a slight accident and
stopped running a fewt minutes ago
the engineer reports it will be all right
in a half hour or less in the mean-
time-

  b p

  braxton nodded understanding to
the clerk and followed the page up the
stairs the balcony on the second floor
was unoccupied the boy gestured a
smiling invitation to choose whichever
seat looked the most comfortable pock-
eted his tip and returned to the office

  as waite passed around the side bal-
cony to the wider front one he raised
his eyes and observed that the elevator
was stalled near the top of the shaft
the elevator door at the fifth floor was
open and the cage hung so that its top
was at the entrance level on the cage
a man was working-engineer or ele-
vator attendant evidently he crawled
out picked up a tool of some sort and
a handful of waste as braxton looked
and returned to his tinkering brax-
tons impression as he caught this
glimpse of the workman was that he
was a japanese when he reached the
broad balcony at the front and se-
lected a chair iti a group of several the-
elevator was outside his range of
vision

  across the shaft where he could see
the head of the first stairway and the
foot of the second there came into
view a moment later a dark bearded
face set above a round heavy body
colonel fiorencio calderon puffing
from the unwonted exertion was
climbing to his third-floor room to
keep his appointment he rested for
breath a second at the head of the first
flight and continued out of sight up
the second without looking toward
braxton

  perhaps five more moments passed
and down the stairs from the floor
above came a woman dressed in white
before she had descended far enough
for him to see her face braxton knew
it was miss lynde there was an un-
usual swing and freedom to her car-
riage he rose as she completed the
flight looked across the shaft to where
he awaited her and came to him around
the side balcony


the popular magazine

  she was hurrying and as she ex-
tended her hand she was somewhat
breathless

  i am afraid i have made you wait
she exclaimed not being on time is
a fault i try to avoid my cousins will
be right down

  he murmured the usual bromides in
such cases made- and provided miss
lynde in a simple evening gown was
even better to look upon than she had
been in street clothes that afternoon
the reddish glints in her hair were em-
phasized by the electric light there
were spots of color in her creamy
cheeks braxton noticed that the pu-
pils of her eyes were dilated hehadnt
observed that in the afternoon but then
he had had little opportunity to study
her eyes with pupils enlarged as they
were now he thought and in the eve-
ing their color was neither gray nor
blue but of a deep pansy shade

  she was talking vivaciously i
came by cousin marys room and told
her she was late she said and she
replied they would be right down
wasnt it a beautiful sunset we drove
out to chapultepec you have been
there at sunset of course  ixtlacihuitl
and popocatapetl were in plain sight
to-day who could believe those old
sleeping volcanoes were eighty miles
away have you ever been to ori-
zaba 

  waite made monosyllabic replies as
required but there seemed little need
for him to talk she rattled on touch-
ing subject after subject he had not
thought that afternoon that she was
a young woman likely to be nervous in
manner or speech he would have to
revise that opinion she did not pos-
sess quite as much poise as he had ex-
pected

  she sat facing the stairway and fre-
quently turned her eyes toward it
they are coming she exclaimed
finally and he rose with her and went
forward a few steps to meet the car-

sons-a quiet prim colorless little man
of forty to forty-five and a quiet prim
colorless little wife of about the same
age

 mrs carson who was cousin
mary took braxtons hand and said
in a perfectly correct manner with just
the right amount of courteous em-
phasis that she wanted to thank him
for his service to esther mr carson
shook hands with equal cordiality and
added his thanks

  then with an air that was almost as
though their duty for the occasion had
been completed the carsons subsided
into chairs and miss lynde resumed
her vivacious conversation braxton
himself was a good talker and he found
his wits busied in keeping up with her
shifts of subject so nervous a bril-
liancy was a quality that surpassed him

  he was enjoying himself only occa-
sionally does one meet a young woman
who combines beauty of face figure
and mind miss lynde had them all to
a marked degree a most attractive
girl

  the stairways were within the range
of his eye into view descending from
the third floor came dress shoes highly
correct dress trousers a white waist-
coat and expanse of shirt front-and
the face of fritz von arnoldt the ger-
man was clean-shaven-the upturned
mustaches that braxton remembered as
emphasizing his military caste when
they had met in buenos aires were
gone-but in other respects he had not
changed erect pink-cheeked blue-
eyed of distinguished manner he was
a man to look at twice also braxton
knew by experience a man to consider
very seriously as a factor in any inter-
national matters with which he was con-
cerned

  as he crossed from the foot of the
second flight to the head of the first
von arnoldt looked across and saw
them he raised his hat with pleasant
cordiality and miss lynde and the car-
a fourfoud game



sons bowed if von arnoldt recognized
braxton if he even noticed him he
gave no sign but continued leisurely
down to the ground floor

  the talk ran on-of the sensational
rumors of the intervention that were
making possible such experiences as
miss lynde had undergone that after-
noon of people and things in new
york and washington of changes in
mexico city since the madero revolu-
tion braxton lost track of the train
of conversation for a few seconds as
leroy payne ascended the stairs and
disappeared toward the third floor
payne did not seem to glance in brax-
tons direction

  barely two minutes had elapsed and
miss lynde was saying something
about the absurdity of paying twelve
pesos for a bunch of violets in the
flower market that has a reputation for
being one of the cheapest in the world
when payne came down the stairs he
was leaping-two steps at a time-and
his face was startled and pale he
went on down to the ground floor
why was he leaving so soon  why
was he in such a violent hurry 

  a moment more and payne re-
appeared returning upstairs a clerk
was hurrying beside him and the man-
ager of the hotel a stout elderly man
toiled behind then after a very short
time there came two policemen guided
by an obviously excited page

  there seems to be something un-
usual ventured mr carson mildly
it looks as though the police were
going to make an arrest

  if we were in new york we would
be crowding to take a look-see said
braxton trying to speak lightly al-
though he could not but feel that what-
ever had happened was likely to have a
bearing on his own fortunes here it
is usually better to allow the police to
do their work without undue curiosity

  miss lynde was staring at the stairs
her eyes were widened for a mo-

ment she pressed a hand to the corsage
of her dress seeing braxtons eyes
upon her she dropped it

  isnt it exciting she said and
laughed-a little unnaturally he
thought such things always set me
fairly atremble

  he could not make it out she her-
self had passed through a very har-
rowing experience that very aftarnoon
and he was willing to swear that when
he had taken her arm to conduct her
away from police soldiers pale-faced
mexican captain and dark-faced mex-
ican mob she had trembled not at all

  a buzz of confusion came from the
floor below involuntarily they all rose
and stepped to look over the balcony
rail

  a squadron of police-not less than
twenty men-was filing in through the
single entrance of the hotel the of-
ficer in charge was giving sharp quick
orders no person was to be allowed
to leave the hotel no one should pass
from one floor to another

  policemen came running up the
stairs one stopped at the head of the
first flight the others continued on
higher

  whatever it is it looks as if it
might be serious said braxton

  dear me remarked mrs carson
almost placidly

  mr carson was leaning over the
balcony he called over his shoulder

  esther here comes colonel-

what is his name esther he was at
the alburns dinner

  colonel mitze she answered iden-
tifying an alert white-mustached man
in full uniform who had elbowed his
way in through the door and seemed to
be making quick-pointed inquiries he
is with the- foreign-affairs department
the new arrival exchanged a few
words with the police officer in charge
and together they came up the stairs
at that moment the hotel manager the
clerk leroy payne and the two police-


the cpopulacr magazine

men who had been the first to go up
came down the second flight they met
colonel mitze and his companion on
the second floor

  good evening colonel said payne
i am tremendously glad to see you

  good evening senor step this way
please

  mitze payne policemen manager
and clerk came around the side bal-
cony to the place where braxton and
his acquaintances were standing the
colonel recognized miss lynde and the
carsons and bowed abstractedly he
turned brusquely to payne

  now senor he said tell me as
quickly as possible please just how
did it happen 

  the american replied promptly and
steadily

  i had an appointment with colonel
calderon at a quarter of nine oclock or
thereabouts in his room he had told
me to come up i did so the door to
the room was ajar he was on the
floor dead the knife was still in his
heart

chapter v

a vanished note

  esther lynde at braxtons elbow
gasped audibly her face was white
her left hand was pressed to her side
her eyes horrified were fixed on
paynes face she swayed

  hadnt you better sit down brax-
ton advised her solicitously i am
afraid we cannot leave here for some
minutes

  i am all right said the girl get-
ting control of herself with an effort
it startled me-a murder so near us-
i am all right

  payne was going on with his brief
story

  i stepped into the room-just long
enough to see that i could be of no help
-and ran downstairs to notify the
hotel people they sent for the police
and went back to the room with me

  was any one on the third floor when
you went up 

  no one

  did you meet any one coming down
the stairs i am informed colonel
calderon had not been in his room more
than ten or fifteen minutes

  payne seemed to hesitate to try to
recollect but only for a breath no
one he said

  colonel mitze turned to braxton
who are you senor he asked

  my name is braxton-waite brax-
ton-of new york

a flash of recognition lit the colonels
eyes i have heard of you he said
how long have you been in the hotel 
i came in at just eight-thirty the
clerk had me brought here

  you have been on this floor all the
time do you-did you know colonel
calderon

  yes

  were you here when he went up-
stairs 

  yes

  was any one with him-or did any
one follow him 

  he was alone i didnt notice any
one else going upstairsafterward until
i saw mr payne

  i have been facing the staircase
most of the time-it was miss lynde
who spoke-and i do not recall any
one

  colonel mitze turned to her you
knew colonel calderon

  by sight yes

  and you also were here when he
went up

  she paused almost inappreciably
yes

  who has descended the stairs since
then

mr and mrs carson came down
mitze addressed them did you
meet any one on the stairs or on the
third floor or did you hear or see any-
thing unusual there

  mr carson replied in halting span-
a fourfold game



ish ft dont think we saw a soul from
the time we came out of our room un-
til we got here in english he added
did we maryand then translated
to her what he had said

  dear me exclaimed mrs carson
its hard to think esther came to the
door and said she was coming down
and we followed as soon as we could
i dont remember meeting anybody or
seeing anybody

  we are searching all the rooms on
the third fourth and fifth floors said
the police official in charge and
rounding up the servants it isnt
likely the murderer has escaped he
turned to payne what was your
business with colonel calderon  he
asked and how did you happen to
go up without being announced

  i am the mexican representative of
the new york-mexico development
company replied payne we have
charge of the business-of a corporation
-the hacienda les esperanza-which
has lands in tamaulipas there have
been certain taxes against these lands
to which the owners protested i filed
the protest with the state department
and asked for a speedy reply colonel
calderon telephoned me this afternoon
and kindly offered to discuss the mat-
ter with me if i would call at his room
here he told me i should come right

up  v

  the police officer looked inquiringly
at colonel mitze that officer spoke
i happen to know that all this is true
he said i have seen the correspond-
ence i know that only to-day cal-
deron was preparing the figures to give
senor payne furthermore i was in
calderons room when he telephoned
senor payne and made the appoint-
ment

  braxton sighed with relief when
colonel calderon so carefully built up
this chain of circumstantial protection
for himself how little he realized he
was proving the necessary defense for

a man who might fall under suspicion
of being his murderer

  the policeman took a few sheets of
paper from his blouse and handed them
to mitze would these be the figures
colonel calderon was to show senor
payne he asked

  the same replied mitze after a
glance where did you get them
our first act was to search the body
these were in the breast pocket of his
coat

  braxton with an effort repressed his
desire to put the question that logically
followed but mitze asked it

  were there any other papers
none that seem to be important 
an old letter or two a small notebook
with memoranda of appointments-in-
cluding this one with senor payne by
the way nothing else

  had the body been robbed

  in his pockets were his watch some-
thing over a thousand pesos in cur-
rency and eighty dollars in united
states gold his studs and rings were
untouched

  the police official as colonel mitze
seemed for a moment lost in thought
turned again to payne

  how long were you upstairs he
asked

  payne smiled and shook his head
its hard to say just long enough to
walk up slowly go into the room turn
around and come down very fast
that is true put in the hotel man-
ager senor payne and i stood a mo-
ment conversing beside the desk be-
fore he went up he left me ascended
the stairs and-pronto-he was com-
ing down again

  you can safely eliminate senor
payne from your theories said colo-
nel mitze with some impatience i
tell you i knew all about this appoint-
ment of his with calderon

the police official bowed it is my
duty to exhaust all inquiries he said
a policeman came down the stairs


the potpuljjr magazine

and approached his superior we have
gathered all the servants in the house
he reported most of them were in
their rooms in the rear of the fifth
floor they are being taken to the
ground floor in the elevator

  when did the elevator start run-
ning the hotel manager asked his
clerk

  kaju must have just got it fixed
was the reply i seem to remember he
was still hammering above the cage
when we ran upstairs with senor
payne

 this elevator man where was
he  asked the police official what
was he doing

  at the top of the shaft he had
been working there an hour or more
it got out of order about eight oclock

  the official turned to a policeman
bring the elevator man here  he com-
manded

  at this moment the elevator passed
the second floor descending filled with
weeping gesticulating protesting serv-
ants of both sexes herded by police-
men it ascended and made another
downward trip with a similar load
then it came up to the second floor
and the policeman who had received
the order came forward with a short
wide-shouldered japanese

  the man who looked to be young-
in his late twenties perhaps-was in
overalls and very dirty there was
grease on his hands and grease on his
face braxton shrewdly eying him
and having some ability to size up peo-
ple of that race noted that his com-
plexion was comparatively light and his
head well shaped he faced the police
officer and colonel mitze stupidly

  your name demanded the officer

  kaju kimohoto excuse i do not
speak spanish so good

 where have you been the last
hour 

  elevator is stopped i make re-
pairs there he pointed up and

across the covered patio to where brax-
ton had seen him at work

  see or hear anything unusual see
anybody down below-on the third
floor

  no i am at fifth floor on ele-
vator i am making adjustment of
shoes it is small repairs i do not
need to call machinist i am elevator
man make good small repairs when

elevator shoes need to be-

  enough you heard no sound-no
unusual sound you saw no one run-
ning did not some one come up the
stairs from the third floor a little while
ago to the fifth floor

  the orientals face was blank he
shook his head vaguely

  i did not see i did not hear i am
on top of elevator i cannot see un-
less men pass me close i am some-
times perhaps making noise with ham-
mer there are nuts that are to be
loosened elevator needs to have shoes
adjusted it is small matter so i can
fix

  thats all said the officer go
wash your hands and face and get
back to the car maybe we shall want
to see you again in the morning

  he turned to colonel mitze will
you come down with me while we ques-
tion the servants he asked the colo-
nel nodded

  are we free to go asked brax-
ton or is there any assistance we can
give 

  the police official answered courte-
ously  thank you no we will not
inconvenience you further if anything
should arise that we need you-you
to the carsons and miss lynde are
guests here i understand to payne
i know where to reach you he
turned to braxton and you

  at the american club

  bueno i wish you goodnight
he and the colonel followed by the
manager the clerk and the other po-
licemen hurried downstairs
a foufoud game



  i think if you will excuse me i
will go to my room said miss lynde
she had recovered much of her self-
possession but was still paler than was
natural it has been a strain that
poor man he went upstairs alive and

well and a few minutes later-

  these are war times braxton re-
assured her and this is the capital
of a country in revolution we will
leave you then he addressed payne
walking toward the club

  i am walking toward the nearest
place where i can get a strong satisfy-
ing drink of american liquor declared
payne it shook me up a whole lot
as braxton took miss lyndes hand
to say good night and murmur that he
hoped he would soon see her again
under pleasanter circumstances only a
long-practiced habit of self-control en-
abled him to remain cool smiling and
suave three or four times during the
evening she had inadvertently pressed
her left hand to her side now as she
rose there protruded ever so slightly
from her corsage the corner of a thick
white envelope this of itself would
have seemed strange but to this was
added something more startling if not
sinister the paper was stained red-
dishly not brown as is the stain of
old blood but bright red like new

  and she had told colonel mitze that
she came down the stairs before cal-
deron went up

  braxton and payne walked briskly
to the club they did not discuss the
evenings tragedy on the way one
could not tell what spy might catch a
word

  the moment they found seats in a
corner of the lounge payne made good
his threat to fortify his nerves with
stimulant the waiter served the

drinks and went his way then-

  you didnt get it said braxton
no i shut the door and went
through his clothes like lightning-i
appreciated the importance of getting

out quick and giving the alarm before
time enough should have elapsed for
me to be suspected of it and i found
-exactly the papers the police found
afterward	

 then whoever did it- 

  took the papers and he wasnt
robbed of anything else

  it was quick work the murderer
must have been waiting for him either
in the room or just outside ready to
follow him in and a beautiful get-
away

  braxton said payne the police
dont know why he was killed the
state department doesnt know but
you and i know now who did it
weve got two guesses

  you mean japan and germany
  waite nodded

  and that means the elevator man or
von arnoldt i didnt mention to the
police waite that i met von arnoldt
at the foot of the first flight of stairs
he came down from the third floor
after the murder was committed
yes said braxton i saw him
did miss lynde see him too
braxton hesitated i think so
but she said nobody came down
from the third floor except the carsons
after calderon went up see here
braxton this is a twisted tangle i
never would expect von arnoldt to go
quite as far as that but you never can
tell ought i to have mentioned meet-
ing him do you think

  if i did id have mentioned it my-
self no -if von arnoldt got those
papers we dont want them turned over
to the police or the mexican state de-
partment then the fat would be in
the fire we want him to keep them-
until we can get them away from him
you mean

  if von arnoldt killed calderon or
if somebody else went to get those pa-
pers for him had to use his knife to
make a get-away and turned the pa-
pers over to von arnoldt then von


the popular magazine

arnoldt will be heading for germany-
just as soon as he can wont he if
he leaves mexico im going with him
they sat in silence for several min-
utes payne finally spoke

  calderon whitewashed himself with
mitze all right and fixed himself a
perfect defense in case he ever got ac-
cused of doing business with us but
somebody in the department knew he
had copied that japanese note

  that might apply to either ger-
many or japan theyre both mighty
efficient

  another period of silence if von
arnoldt leaves for new york youre
going with him payne finally said
all right what had i better do
now i mean to-morrow to-
night

 get one of your underground
friends to check up the captains plans
find out when he is going and how
and get me word quick

  ill get busy right away say old
man im terribly disappointed i
thought we had it all fixed

  braxton smiled grimly- im some
disappointed myself he said but
the game isnt played out yet he
rose i want to et off by myself and
think it over hast a manand

  hours passed before sleep came and
when it did it was a restless sleep peo-
pled wtith the same problems that had
kept him tossing wakefully sudden
tragedy policemen an erect distin-
guished smiling prussian stalled ele-
vators  an oriental face peering over
a balcony a vanished secret note on
which might hang the destinies of na-
tions  and a beautiful girl with golden
hair and pansy eyes pressing a hand
to her side against a thick envelope its
corner stained-not brown as with old
blood but red as with new

  while waite braxton was vainly
seeking sleep and leroy payne was
setting in motion the underground ma-

chinery of which he was the engineer
a little wide-shouldered man with- the
resignation of the fatalistic east in his
slanting eyes sat in his room at the
top of the hotel presidente composing
a brief letter it was in the japanese
language but in roman characters-
not chinese ideographs-as becomes
the correspondence of a modern son of
nippon when it was finished he
blotted it carefully addressed it to an
amiable japanese who for years had
conducted a curio store in the avenida
san francisco and mailed it it read

  honorable excellency with deepest
expressions of regret i have to report that
i have failed in the humble mission so hon-
orably intrusted to me i therefore beg
your permission to make such reparation
and amends as are becoming to a descend-
ant of samurai which i shall do if i have
not received your commands to the contrary
before to-morrow night most deferentially
i salute you

chapter vi

von arnoldt gets a smoke

 on the ground floor of the hotel
presidente was convened an informal
court of inquisition the officer of po-
lice presided assisted by colone mitze
before them came servants clerks
guests visitors at the hotel each was
examined as to what he had seen or
heard that might have a bearing on the
tragedy in room no 

  after an hour of diligent investiga-
tion the sum of the information was
this  colonel calderon had ascended
to his room shortly after eight-thirty
shortly before nine leroy payne had
called there and found him dead the
knife with which he was killed was a
plain ordinary knife such as one mex-
ican out of any ten might be expected
to carry it had no identifying marks
there were no finger prints in the
room no bloodstains outside the room
so far as had been discovered cal-
deron had not been robbed
a foljcrfoud game



  that was all in other words after
an hour of questioning the police stood
exactly where they had stood sixty
minutes before

  room no  on one side of cal-
derons was assigned to a man and his
wife visitors from guadalajara they
had left the hotel at seven oclock to
dine with friends room no  on
the other side was unoccupied and
locked room no  was miss
lyndes and no  was occupied by
the carsons other guests whose
rooms were on the front of the third
floor were without exception absent
from their rooms when the tragedy oc-
curred

  there were among the servants two
or three whose characters and records
had become a matter of police knowl-
edge  and although there was nothing
to connect these in any manner with this
crime they were bundled off protest-
ing to the police station

  soon after ten oclock the guard of
police was relaxed and the presidente
again came into possession of its nor-
mal management colonel mitze shook
hands with the police official in charge
as that individual prepared to follow
his subordinates back to headquarters
and said that on account of the late-
ness of the hour he believed he would
telephone his family not to expect him
home and secure a room for the night
there in the hotel

  he did this soon after somewhere
above the third floor if you please he
smilingly requested i am not super-
stitious but-

  on the fourth suggested the clerk
i can give you no  on the fourth
floor front

  excellent

  colonel mitze soon after retired an
hour later there came a cautious rap
upon his door he opened it quickly
to find captain von arnoldt upon the
threshold

  good evening said the german i

wonder if you could accommodate me
with a cigarette i find my case empty
the stand downstairs must be closed
long ago and i am an unfortunate
slave to tobacco

  with pleasure declared the colonel
cordially come in senor i should
be honored if you would visit a few
moments and smoke with me i have
been sitting in thought the recent
stirring events make me wakeful
von arnoldt bowed entered and the
door closed

  colonel mitze however made no
move to offer his late guest cigarettes
he crossed the room to an open win-
dow leaned out and surveyed the fire
escape below above and to each side
it was empty he noted that a win-
dow was open in an adjacent room
whereupon he closed his own window
and the wooden blinds von arnoldt
meantime had stood silently in the mid-
dle of the room

  satisfied that they could neither be
seen nor overheard by eavesdroppers
the colonel drew a chair to the center
and motioned the german to another
near at hand he spoke cautiously

  a strange coincidence senor ar-
noldt that i should have arrived here
on my errand to meet you just after
the death of my poor friend calderon
i noticed you were within hearing when
i engaged this room on the same floor
as yours if you had not come to me
very soon i should have come to you
but i was waiting i thought meeting
here was better

  von arnoldt bowed i feared the
incident had upset our plans

  only temporarily we could not go
on with them naturally while the in-
vestigation was in progress besides i
hoped to be able to help get at the bot-
tom of the mystery of his death he
was my friend he has been my as-
sistant sincej entered the department
the germans face expressed sym-


the wpular magazine

pathy but he remained silent colonel
mitze sighed

  well his sudden end poor fellow
cannot be allowed to interfere with
matters of state that have to be done
he unbuttoned his waistcoat and took
from an inner pocket an envelope
here is the communication you pro-
pose i understand to place it person-
ally in the hands of the highest possible
authority

  the foreign secretary at least per-
haps the emperor replied von arnoldt
simply

  good  it is in spanish there was
no way we could reduce it to any code
that would leave it still in force as a
communication between nations there
is a certain risk to handing it to you in
such a form

  no one shall see it until it reaches
berlin-unless i am dead said von
arnoldt gravely and even if acci-
dent befalls me i think no one will find
it i do not boast colonel but this is
not the first secret message that has
been intrusted to me-and the others
did not fall into hostile hands

  i know we are familiar with your
record and the trust that is reposed in
you in wilhelmstrasse

  he handed the german the packet
which von arnoldt placed carefully in
an inside pocket von arnoldt broke
the silence that followed

  is it permissible he asked to tell
me for my personal information
whether this message is identical in con-
tents with that which general valdez is
carrying to japan 

  that question senor is answered by
the note itself the form differs some-
what they bear similarly on the same
subject you understand there must
naturally be some divergence-japan
and germany being at this moment on
opposite sides in the present unfor-
tunate hostilities

  von arnoldt rose to his feet i
shall try to leave for vera cruz day

after to-morrow morning he looked
at his watch no he corrected to-
morrow morning-it is already past
midnight and another day should i
have any trouble getting my passports
vised or otherwise in making plans i
trust your office will facilitate me be
assured i shall not call upon you un-
less it is necessary

  i think it will not be foreigners
with clear papers are not having trou-
ble leaving the country just now-not
even americans however you have

only to get me word-

  i thank you colonel and now as i
shall not see you again-at least on this
visit-let me thank you for your cour-
tesy and kindness and will you ex-
press my sentiments of deepest consid-
eration to your most distinguished
chief

  it will be a pleasure he would
have done himself the honor to place
these papers in your hands in person
but it was better that i a subordinate-

and not at the palace-

  i appreciate the position perfectly
and so my dear colonel i bid you
good-by and hope the negotiations we
have been honored in furthering will
advance to the mutual advantage of our
beloved countries they shook hands
and bowed deeply in the continental
fashion then from his own case he
took a cigarette lighted it and stepped
to the door

  you have given sleep to one who
otherwise might have remained wakeful
for who knows how many hours he
laughed as he threw open the door
what was it the american humorist
wrote a woman is only a woman
but a cigarette is a smoke 

  the pleasure senor has been mine
replied colonel mitze i wish you
calm nerves and pleasant dreams
wrhether or not this wish came true
there was nothing in captain von ar-
noldts appearance as he appeared
downstairs before eight oclock the fol-
a fourfold game



lowing morning to indicate that he had
not passed a comfortable night he en-
tered the dining room with his accus-
tomed erect jauntiness breakfasted
heartily and leisurely and then at the
hotel desk announced to the manager
that he would be giving up his room on
the following morning after which he
engaged a cab and called at the rail-
road ticket office and upon the proper
officials for the viseing of his pass-
ports

  he completed these errands at a lit-
tle before ten oclock at ten-fifteen
braxton who had not fallen asleep
until nearly daylight and was busily
making up for it was awakened by
payne

  up thou sluggard commanded his
visitor while you saw wood rome
burns 

  braxton rubbed his eyes and sought
to rouse himself completely lord
look what time it is he exclaimed
he threw water on himself and his
thoughts became coherent whats
that about rome burning whats hap-
pened 

  nothing yet but my underground
has just reported that our teutonic
friend takes the train for vera cruz
to-morrowt morning there is a sailing
the following day for havana and new
york something tells me you are
about to take a long journey

  braxton began to dress hurriedly
it almost seems like leaving the job
to go away with von arnoldt on the
chance that he has that note he said
after a few moments after all what
we are supposed to do is to get a copy
of it-not stop germany from doing so
i wonder if i am making a mistake i
wonder if i oughtnt to stay here and
try to get another copy from some other
mexican than calderon

  i dont know from whom con-
fessed payne and if i find there is
somebody else that can be touched for

it-well it wont take you but ten days
to get back here and its as easy to get
into mexico as it is to get out-some-
times easier

  in the meantime leroy its a cinch
you are safe in adding mr kimohoto
of the presidente to your list of for-
eign attaches he may have had noth-
ing to do with that affair last night but
that complexion and forehead do not
fit his apparent stupidity

  correct said payne and there
are a lot more of them make a list
of japanese residents in a foreign coun-
try and you have a fairly correct list
of japanese spies and the duke would
become a dishwasher if the elder
statesman said so you cant beat that
and speaking of hard things to beat
how are you going to get that message
if he has it away from von arnoldt
hes some able citizen that hombre
i dont know sufficient unto the
day if he leaves the boat at havana
thats one thing if he goes on to new
york thats something else again i
think id rather he went on to new
york and ive got ajiunch he will it
is easier to get into germany through
sweden than any other way and there
are boats from new york to stock-
holm and now im going to have two
cups of coffee not mexican style and
hustle out to see about my tickets and
passports

  ill see you here at the club about
noon perhaps my underground will de-
velop some more information by the
way waite do you often play a hunch
like youre playing this one

  as a matter of fact i dont very
often play them at all replied brax-
ton seriously ignoring his companions
jocularity but the hunch ive got
that that document calderon had is
going north on the boat with von ar
noldt is very very clearly defined
early the following morning brax-
ton accompanied by payne to see him
off entered the railroad station and


the mvuljicr magazine

prepared to board the train that climbs
the mountains about mexico city and
then in a few hours drops eight thou-
sand feet down to the sea

  the details of preparing for the jour-
ney had taken nearly all his time the
preceding day he had called at the
presidente late in the afternoon and
asked for miss lynde or the carsons
only to be informed they were all out
he left his card with a brief pencil-
ing that he was leaving the city and re-
gretted not seeing them again it was a
disappointment he felt singularly at-
tracted to the girl notwithstanding their
divergent paths of duty and the evi-
dence of his own eyes and reason

  now as he stood in the station he
could not help thinking of her and
wondering if fate would ever bring
them together again he hoped it
would grimly he thought that people
in their business usually meet again
sooner or later if the reaper spares
them long enough witness as illustra-
tion his present journey just to be in
the company of fritz von arnoldt
whom last he saw in south america

  from a carriage preceded by a
portero loaded with luggage came von
arnoldt at this moment he saw
braxton and payne and approached
them smiling

 good morning mr payne he
cried in excellent english am i to
have the pleasure of your company
down to the coast-perhaps out onto
the bounding main 

  payne shook his head i am sorry
to say i am still condemned to exile
from my home my native land he
laughed my friend braxton is going
let me make you gentlemen ac-
quainted mr braxton mr arnoldt

  if i am not mistaken we have met
-some time ago smiled the german
shaking hands cordially it was-in
buenos aires if i remember correctly
yes in buenos aires about three
years ago mr braxton you were on

a business trip as i recall it i saw you
several times

  i remember you very well indeed
agreed waite with a proper degree of
warmth very well he knit his
brows i do not recall your business
you had interests in one of the ger-
man banks did you not

  i transacted considerable business
with several of them although i was
not exactly interested waite hoped
he had succeeded in impressing von
arnoldt with the fact that he had for-
gotten his connections on the south
american occasion which would also
imply that he did not remember either
his title of captain or prefix of von
you as i recall it were at that time
with the universal oil company
thats what it is to be connected
with an octopus waite exclaimed
payne merrily you cant escape
being identified with it the only thing
that has saved braxton from being
muckraked he explained confi-
dentially to von arnoldt his eyes
twinkling is his youth and otherwise
good character

  the german laughed i had feared
i should be lonely on my journey
this is a great pleasure

  braxton opened his mouth to con-
tinue the pleasant badinage but closed
it again through the portal came mr
carson mrs carson and esther
lynde miss lynde looked from brax-
ton to payne from payne to von ar-
noldt and back to braxton again

  are you going to vera cruz too
she cried

  yes are you

 then they both looked at each
others pile of luggage and laughed and
payne and von arnoldt joined in
braxton thought she looked surprised
but not regretful it looks as though
we might have on a trip that i ex-
pected would be lonely a most pleas-
ant and congenial party said the ger-
man i was delighted to learn mr
a foucrfoud game



braxton was to be a fellow passenger
your presence makes the company
ideal

  an official announced that the train
was ready the exploration en-
gine which would precede the train to
make sure that bandits loosened rails
or dynamite should not interfere with
its orderly progress to vera cruz was
at that moment leaving a second
train which would follow the pas-
senger carrying a company of soldiers
in case of emergency was ready to
start the five entered a car together
bade merry farewells to payne and the
train moved

  at just that moment the manage-
ment of the hotel presidente was re-
porting to the police that kaju kimo-
hoto elevator attendant had failed to
appear for duty at the usual hour that
morning his room had been forced
and his body found there the man-
ner of his death was clear-that grue-
some ceremonial form of suicide
known in his native land as hara-kiri

chapter vii

at sea

  quite without excitement the train
ride to vera cruz proved to be ban-
dits if any lurked in the mountain
pass through which they journeyed re-
served their dynamite for some more
convenient season when exploration
engines and following troop trains
should not be so interferingly in evi-
dence

  the time schedule was considerably
slower and the train moved more cau-
tiously than it was wont to do when
don porfirios rurales kept peace be-
tween the pacifie and the gulf and
there were relics of war along the right
of way-charred ties twisted rails here
and there the metal of a destroyed
freight car from time to time
through the windows they could see
patches of the new vegetation that has

been planted in tens of thousands of
spots in mexico during the past five
years and is the only flourishing crop
in all the country in these latter days-
the clumsy rough-made crosses stick-
ing in the ground which bear not the
simplest inscription but declare each
one of them here a man died 

  these things were there to remind
the passer-by that war had been and
was but nothing untoward happened to
bring it home to them the days jour-
ney was pleasantly uneventful

  von arnoldt proved a delightful
traveling companion and miss lynde
was as bright as sparkling as vivacious
and as charming as braxton would have
expected her to be what shock of
nerves she had undergone two nights
before had not left any noticeable ef-
fect appraising her at moments when
she could not know she was under ob-
servation waite was unable to see that
she showed the slightest sign of any
burden on either mind or conscience

  rather he would have said her atti-
tude was one of relief-an attitude that
she frankly confessed before they had
fairly left the railroad yards of mex-
ico city behind although she credited
her feelings to a different cause than he
surmised was responsible

  thank goodness we are leaving
she exclaimed i thought it would be
fine and adventurous to visit mexico
and when cousin marys interests made
it advisable that she and cousin
thomas should come in person to
straighten them out i bullied them into
bringing me but-- ugh she
shuddered the united states never
appealed to me so much in my life as it
does this minute

  we are not out of mexico yet sug-
gested mrs carson i wish you
wouldnt exult so soon it seems almost
like flying in the face of providence
for my part if i had really believed
sudden death was hanging around cor-


the popular magazine

ners the way it is in mexico i wouldnt
have come and it might have cost me
quite a bit of proppity too she added
from which last word but one brax-
ton identified her as certainly of new
england upbringing a queer charac-
ter he thought to be wandering
through a country at war trusting for
protection to a husband apparently as
unsophisticated as herself and a girl

  then his mind came up sharp with
a shock against the proposition that
the carsons and miss lynde were not
alone but under the protection of as
competent an adventurer as traveled
the seven seas he had almost for-
gotten their association with von ar-
noldt

 the german more than once ex-
pressed his delight at so unexpectedly
finding miss lynde his traveling com-
panion both he and the girl braxton
had to confess acted this part with
consummate skill each had seemed
properly surprised at the presence of
the other at the station without in the
least overdoing it and there was noth-
ing in their manner now to indicate that
they had any common interest other
than pleasant friendship

  there were no difficulties in the way
of the partys embarkation at vera
cruz and the following afternoon saw
them outside the harbor and heading
across the waters of the gulf

 arrangements were made with the
purser for seats at the captains table
and the first dinner found miss lynde
braxton and von arnoldt there to eat 
it a merry laughing party neither
of the carsons were  hand a sailor
would not have called the gulf swell
rough that night but a landsman might
have the carsons were not good
sailors

  braxton whose sea legs were always
easily attained and held experienced a
feeling of pleasure when he learned
that miss lynde was also immune to
seasickness that von arnoldt too

was able to take his three to five meals
a day whatever the condition of the
sea or the shifting angle of the deck
was a fly in the ointment but not a
very big one

  in fact braxton felt rather gratified
at realizing the german would probably
be on deck most of the trip it might
furnish opportunity to learn where he
had concealed the cipher which waite
did not doubt had long since passed
from miss lyndes possession into his
that it might prevent uninterrupted
walks and talks with the girl braxton
also realized and regretted yet it
could not be said he suffered very seri-
ous disappointment admiration he felt
for miss lynde and a certain pleasure
in her company but if any deeper at-r
traction had begun to exist he was
quite unconscious of it he would
have laughed incredulously had some
one with a gift for reading the future
told him what spell was about to be
worked by those two accomplished
slaves of cupid-sea voyage and
propinquity  perhaps after he had
laughed he would have set his mind
and heart to resist the spell this how-
ever as he was not warned is some-
thing hidden away forever from all
prying eyes in that filing cabinet of the
fates which bears the label what
might have been

  by the passenger list beside his plate
at dinner braxton observed von ar-
noldt had again suffered loss to his
name the last letter was missing-by
the germans own act without doubt
-and he was no longer recorded as
from mannheim f arnold new
york city was the name as it ap-
peared on the ships register he had
been speaking english exclusively-
except when spanish was necessary-
since they left mexico city now on
shipboard he continued this and in
various other ingenious ways sought
to convey the impression to strangers
that he was entirely an american-of
a fourfoud game



german descent clearly but never-
theless an american

  one cannot tell the prejudices even
of the best-intentioned neutrals in
these days he laughed there is no
reason why a german should delib-
erately emphasize his nationality-espe-
cially on the high seas from which
chance remark was born in braxtons
mind an idea that incubated until it
helped some days later to solve a most
difficult problem

  in the test of wits that must be ap-
plied before the lampasas should
sweep past sandy hook he felt he
had one distinct advantage he knew
the personality and vocation of his op-
ponents while to them he was merely
braxton of universal oil an agent
for big business

  but did he know this he asked
himself the question very seriously
sitting alone late that night in a shel-
tered corner of the boat deck after
most of the other passengers had gone
to bed

  as to von arnoldts trade there was
no guesswork but esther lynde  he
arrayed what facts regarding her he
possessed they were comparatively
few but they bore out uncompromis-
ingly the suspicion that payne had
voiced when her name was first men-
tioned in his presence

  in brief they summed up thus she
was a young woman of unusual self-
reliance unquestioned good breeding
and cosmopolitan training she had en-
tered mexico at a moment when few
women would have done so her re-
mark that she had done this because she
thought it would be fine and adventur-
ous could not be taken at its face value
--it implied a lesser grade of intel-
ligence than she obviously possessed
her arrival in mexico city had been
coincident with the arrival of one of
germanys most able and experienced
secret agents they had speedily become

intimate acquaintances and she was de-
parting from the country with him

  last-and strongest evidence-was
the incontrovertible fact that she and
von arnoldt had been the only people
with the exception of the clearly in-
nocent carsons to come down the third-
floor stairs after colonel calderon wrent
up them to his death her unnatural
confusion and emotion during the hour
that followed and the red-stained en-
velope carried in such untimely fashion
in the bodice of her dress this plus
the equally incontestable fact that as
regards her time of coming down the
stairs she had made a deliberate mis-
statement

  braxton did not for the briefest sec-
ond credit miss lynde with actual par-
ticipation in the murder of calderon
he would have staked his reputation on
that for that matter he was inclined
to doubt that von arnoldt had done
the actual killing-the man was un-
scrupulous enough in the service in
which he was engaged but hardly an
assassin yet who knew that the
crime was the work of a deliberate as-
sassin was it not equally probable
that some plan to gain possession of
the papers without violence had gone
awry and necessitated as the only price
of immunity from exposure the sud-
den knife thrust he believed who-
ever had gained the cipher from cal-
derons pocket had very soon afterward
intrusted it to miss lynde further
than this he did not believe her to be
implicated and yet he had to admit
that in this feeling of confidence he was
letting his heart rule his head

  he could find but one flaw in the in-
dictment

  why should a young american girl
enter the service of germany at a mo-
ment when she might have to choose in
allegiance between that country and
her own or if she had entered that
service when doing its work implied no
lack of loyalty to her own flag why


the vopular magazine

should she remain in it after its duties
involved a choice between two nations
one of them a foreign one these two
questions were to be answered in most
natural fashion on the following day
but at this moment braxton could find
no reasonable explanation unless in-
deed miss lynde was only masquerad-
ing as an american and he believed no
actress in the world could portray the
part so well unless she were to the
manner born besides there were the
cousins-colorless mr carson with his
retiring inofifensiveness and colorless
cousin mary with her yankee talk of
proppity

  but who and what were the carsons 
two days of close association with the
party had clearly convinced waite that
miss lynde did not look to them for
advice and consent as to what she pro-
posed to undertake on the contrary
she made the decisions and issued the
orders-in the form of requests and
suggestions diplomatically put-and
they did her bidding therefore it was
a justifiable conclusion that they were
mere companions of the girl-a neces-
sary chaperon and the chaperons
necessary husband

  and must he count them as active
opponents wrere they also in the serv-
ice of the power by which the girl was
employed he doubted it he ques-
tioned soinewhat their actual blood
relationship to miss lynde while re-
proaching himself for letting his sus-
picions carry him that far but he did
not credit them with sufficient strength
of character or intelligence to be play-
ing the great game except as passive
and perhaps unconscious participants

  the missing cipher he felt reason-
ably certain was now in the possession
of von arnoldt two problems pre-
sented themselves-to learn where it
was and to gain possession of it not
any more difficult he thought grimly
than to ascertain the chemical composi-
tion of the rocks on the moons surface

and present samples of them before a
committee of scientists

  well he had eight days and more
unless the german should spring some
change in his program-and braxton
could not see wherein that was prob-
able-he was going through to new
york eight days to plan and execute
and if everything else failed he could
in a pinch wireless the chief and have
the papers seized by the customs of-
ficials although for many reasons not
the least of them the international com-
plications he would not do this unless
every other scheme had been ex-
hausted

  it was during the following fore-
noon that the one flaw in his indict-
ment against miss lynde was proven
not to be a flaw at all and he received
from her own lips the answer to his
wonder as to how at this time she
could consistently be in the same serv-
ice as captain fritz

  the sea had fallen during the night
and at breakfast time the boat was al-
most on an even keel not even spray
was flying across the bows as they sat
-von arnoldt braxton and the girl
-in steamer chairs on the shady side
of the deck breathing the balmy air
of the subtropics and watching the
little twinkling waves break and spill
their miniature crests as the steamship
plowed on its course

  a procession of porpoises a whole
family of them came plunging and
diving in follow-the-leader procession
toward the ship and disappeared from
view ahead of it

  they will be playing in front of the
bow the german said did you ever
watch them from there miss lynde
smiled a negative

  it is very interesting he assured
her suppose we go take a look-
see

  the trio climbed down the com-
panion ladders and made their way
around the usual forward-deck obstruc-
a fourfold game



tions to the very prow of the ship
where they could look down into the
green water that the bow was sweeping
aside

  there sometimes not a yard ahead
of the rushing bow sometimes fairly
touching it were the porpoises they
leaped and turned and dived and
squirmed keeping just ahead of the
ship usually a foot or two under water
but often leaping out of it in curves of
wondrous grace

  this is always a pretty sight and a
fascinating one what passenger in
tropical waters has not watched for
hours the play of porpoises about a
steamers bow miss lynde was de-
lighted her companions although the
sight was not new to either of them
shared her pleasure

  it is the very poetry of motion
declared von arnoldt perhaps be-
cause they were out of earshot of any
other passengers or perhaps by sheer
inadvertence because it was the tongue
in which the thought had formed he
spoke in german

  one could imagine mermaids play-
ing like that miss lynde replied
using the same language with what
seemed to be equal unconsciousness

  braxtons eyes were on the leaping
creatures below you speak german
very fluently he remarked

  indeed yes said von arnoldt
almost perfectly

  there is no reason why i should not
and every reason why i should smiled
the girl my mother was german
and i was born in berlin

chapter viii

a wireless stratagem

  six days and nothing done noth-
ing that is to say toward securing pos-
session of the stolen cipher

  this was not because braxton had
not assiduously tried the cash ex-
penditure necessary to get von ar-

  b p

noldts stateroom and baggage thor-
oughly searched had been no small
matter and bringing about this highly
illegal performance had called for his
best skill and diplomacy but it had
failed neither in the germans bags
nor hidden in his room was any sign
of the paper and he had not placed
anything whatever in the ships safe
or checked any package with the
purser this did not surprise the
american he had not really expected
to find the document judging by what
he himself would do under similar cir-
cumstances he had not believed von
arnoldt would have it anywhere but
on his person

  so now his problem had become sim-
plified if simplified can be used to
describe a problem that still seemed to
have no solution short of assault bat-
tery and robbery by violence for
three days now since the searched state-
room braxton had been wrestling with
it considering scheme after scheme
and discarding each as fast as it formed
because it seemed more wildly imprac-
ticable than the last

  during this time however he had
not been moping about the decks wear-
ing on his face a reflection of the wor-
ries that were in his mind he had
participated in the life on shipboard
like any other passenger and enjoyed
it perhaps it is not too much to say
that there had been hours on end when
his errand had been hardly more than
a shadow lurking in the background of
his subconsciousness in fact the last
thought but one before he dropped of
to sleep nights was often that he was
neglecting his task that if he were to
apply himself more to studying it
maybe he would better find a way to
accomplish it the last thought but
one you notice somehow or other
night after night the last thought was
invariably of some incident or other
that had for its central figure a grace-
ful firm-muscled girl with creamy


the popular magazine

skin golden hair that flickered reddish
tints and eyes that seemed sometimes
blue sometimes gray and sometimes
pansy and violet

  do not understand that waite brax-
ton was consciously in love with esther
lynde he was attracted by her ad-
mired her tried to please her and win
the reward of friendly smile or com-
radely nod he had no idea of loving
her or trying to win her affection the
mere fact of their opposite allegiances
was enough to keep his consciousness
from this

  nor was he any callow boy to go
following whithersoever a pretty face
might lead and the very rudiments of
the service impress upon its young men
the dangers of too close association
with all fair damosels most especially
if they be under suspicion of serving
some other government

  no he was not in love with esther
lynde he was merely by way of sow-
ing the seed that might later burst forth
into such a harvest

  they ate at the same table read in
adjacent deck chairs through long
drowsy afternoons took part together
in the various simple games and diver-
sions that break the tedium of ocean
travel did their mile constitutional
about the deck-usually with von
arnoldt as a fellow pedestrian-each
pleasant evening after dinner stood out
under the stars together talking of
many things or falling into those un-
derstanding silences that mark the
progress of friendship

  von arnoldt shared this friendship
but did not endeavor to monopolize it
it occurred to braxton more than once
to wonder if the german were in love
with the girl but he hardly thought so
although it was difficult ever to guess
what emotions might lie behind the
polished continental manner nor did
he think esther was desirous of being
more than friend of von arnoldt he
saw nothing to indicate it at any rate

in fact if he had been jealously ana-
lytical of her conduct he could not have
decided in fairness that she showed any
preference for the society of either him
or his professional rival

  so the lampasas plowed on toward
east and north past progreso to
havana out by morro castle again into
the sea and at last toward the stars in
the big dipper on the last leg of the
homeward cruise

 they lost some passengers at
havana mexicans who were seeking
the nearest refuge in a latin land but
they gained more than they lost and
the current language spoken became
less spanish and more english many
of the newcomers were tourists return-
ing from brief visits to cuba these
included nobody who was known to
braxton or who especially interested
him or his companions he miss
lynde von arnoldt and the carsons
remained a coterie sufficient to them-
selves

  it was at luncheon the day after the
inevitable ships concert that braxton
received the suggestion which he was to
act upon a day later to force the ger-
mans hand it was odd that he got it
indirectly from the biggest bore at the
captains table it was not in this case
that wisdom proceeded from the lips of
a fool what the bore said was not at
all wise but a twist the conversation
took because of his maunderings gave
waite his idea

  the weather was clear and calm and
captain steele was performing the
duties that fall to the passenger mas-
ters lot when subordinates may be
safely left to guide and control the ship
that is to say he had ceased for the
time to be a navigator and had become
proprietor manager and major-domo
of a floating hotel he strolled about
the decks making small talk with the
passengers he presided with grace
and jollity at his table making a few
good jokes telling a few good stories
a foutfold game



harmonizing incipient arguments with
tact and diplomacy and laughing geni-
ally at everybody elses witticisms re-
gardless of their excellence or vintage

  pity the poor passenger captain at
whose table sits the ass the wind-
jammer and the bore he must wish
he could smite the fool where he sits
or be called to the bridge to wrestle
even with calamity a west indian
hurricane in the straits with the ba-
hama mud banks on the one hand and
the coral keys of florida on the other
would be a relief to the master mariner
who for three days has had to approve
the drivelings of the bore who thinks
the lord endowed him with wisdom

  this particular nuisance was a nega-
tive individual with a yachting cap on
his first trip outside the united states
one gathered also without his saying
it that his idea of the great west was
cleveland ohio and that if fate
should ever take him so far south as
baltimore maryland he would
straightway become a professional
southerner and yell louder than any
real southron at dixie for all the
remainder of his life

  a harmless person he was who
would have been inoffensive enough if
he hadnt felt it necessary to interject
his opinions into every conversation
the gift of senseless gab mrs car-
son called it-a most expressive new
englandism

  when he gave braxton the idea he
really said very little because he was
tactfully but determinedly shut off
the conversation had taken some turn
that brought up the subject of flying
fish

  i saw this morning said the bore
raising his voice and then pausing to
observe whether all the table was giv-
ing proper attention a flying fish that
propelled itself through the air a
distance of at least twenty yards or
perhaps twenty-two or three i have
often observed them do ten yards or

 thereabouts but on this occasion i was
 able to get a line that measured it i
 stood just forward of the smokestack

   do you think flying fish have any
 control of their direction when they are
 - out of the water miss lynde asked
 the captain as the bore paused to catch
 his breath or do they just sail on the
 wind in the direction in which they
 happen to start

   i dont think they give a lot of
 thought to where they are going cap-
 tain steele replied

   the bore must have been going on
 despite the interruption for his voice
 rose and unquestionably a flying
 fish is the most beautiful fish in the

 world i have observed-

    i think a grout is the most beauti-
 ful fish said a young new york girl

   the fish have wonderful colorings
 at kingston somebody else put in

    the true test of a fishs beauty is
 its taste declared a well-to-do manu-
 facturer with twinkling eyes who
 often said something when he spoke
 that being the case i am divided be-
 tween swordfish and dinners-those
 big cunners that you get on the maine
 coast they make my mouth water
 just to think of them

   i cannot see remarked the bore
 - frowning how anybody can think a
 swordfish is a handsome fish although
 i must confess i have never seen them
 except in markets now the flying
 fish-

   what do you think is the hand-
 somest fish captain asked the girl
 from new york

   captain steele dropped his napkin
 and prepared to leave both the table
 and the discussion his reply was
 diplomacy itself not for seamanship
 alone had he been appointed to man-
 age an ocean ferry

    in the little town on the north eng-
 lish coast where i was born he said


the populacr magazine

they had a song that might apply to
that it began

      of all the fishes in the sea

      the erring is the fish for me

  perhaps the bore kept on talking
braxton did not notice two sentences
combined in his mind to give him in-
spiration one was in the little town
on the north english coast where i was
born the other there is no rea-
son why a german should deliberately
emphasize his nationality-especially
upon the high seas

  that night after dinner he sent a
note to the captain asking to see him
privately on a matter of importance
the messenger brought back word that
he could come to the captains room
back of the bridge and chart house

  captain braxton began you are
an american citizen of course or you
would not be commanding a ship flying
the american flag but you were born
in england

  the captain bowed in silence eying
waite speculatively

  your sympathies so far as you can
have any are with the allies then in
the present war 

  i am an american i have no sym-
pathies what are you driving at
if you were convinced you could
by one slightly irregular act truly serve
america-even though that act injured
germany-you would do so wouldnt
you 

  see here mr braxton i dont
especially like that slightly irregular
and i dont know what youre talking
about ill listen to what youve got to
say-if youll stop beating about the
bush but ill remark this if youre
thinking of saying something that is
in any way against the interests of the
united states or proposing anything
that a steamship master under the
american flag might not honorably do
why youd better save your breath
braxton sized his man he liked his

looks and his talk in any event he
asked will you regard what i say as
confidential 

  i will if it is proper for me to do
so and if it isnt youd better not tell
me

  all right captain listen brax-
ton leaned forward and talked rapidly
at first steele maintained his appear-
ance of aloof reserve then slowly he
thawed his eyes showed interest
he too leaned forward he listened
ten minutes interrupting occasionally
to ask a question at the end of which
time he was in possession of as much
of the story as waite thought it neces-
sary to tell to gain the desired co-
operation braxton had not inciden-
tally even mentioned the name of
esther lynde

  then the government agent outlined
his plan several times captain steele
shook his head negatively braxton
modified his suggestions to meet the ob-
jections after a time he said  

  really captain all i ask you to do
is to allow your man to send the mes-
sage anonymously and that you and he
keep silent about it both during and
after this voyage you can do that
cant you

  the captain considered yes he
said and i will always subject-if
you will excuse a sailors bluntness-
always subject to my finding out that
you have deceived me in which case
i shall make it so damned hot for you
that youll wish you hadnt done it

  braxton wrote a few lines on a sheet
of blank paper handed it to the cap-
tain who read it slowly and nodded
descended the stairs to the main deck
and spent the remainder of the evening
in normal fashion long afterward in
the hours when all clear-conscienced
passengers might be presumed to be
asleep the captain sent for the night
operator from the wireless room to
that young man he gave definite in-
structions coupled with threats
a foufoud game



  thereupon blue sparks quivered and
zigzagged and ripped and crackled in
the wireless room of the lampasas a
young man in uniform sitting with re-
ceivers over his ears aboard his bri-
tannic majestys ship middlesex on
patrol ten miles southeast of sandy
hook lightship adjusted his instru-
ment to get the wave length rattled a
brief message and then set out to write
what came crinkling through the ether
the officer in charge of the middlesex
a few moments later was handed the
following

chapter ix

an international incident

  captain the honorable james wil-
liam aubrey came hastily into the wire-
less room in person

  why isnt there any signature to
this he demanded who sent it

  i dont know sir replied the
operator some one kept calling
british patrol british patrol-in
words not by number and not this ship
by name so it wasnt any of our peo-
ple sir-and finally i asked him what
he wanted without giving our posi-
tion or number of course sir and he
sent this message i tried to get him
to sign it--asked him if he was the
lampasas-but he wouldnt reply sir

  devilish funny grumbled captain
aubrey see if you can get the lam-
pasas now by her regular code num-
ber

  the operator consulted a book by
his elbow as he looked up from it
and reached for his key he said

  the lampasas equipment gives the
same wave length as the message i got
sir and it sounded just about strong
enough to be about ten hours beyond

diamond shoals a few moments
later he exclaimed ive got him
sir

  ask him if he sent us any message
a while ago

  a short wait he says no sir
ask him if he minds telling us
whether he has a man on the passenger
list named f arnold and if he has
where arnold hails from

  another interval he says there is
such a passenger aboard sir registered
as from new york

  all right thank him and tell him
good night

  the british captain stood some min-
utes in the lee of the bridge his brows
wrinkled thinking deeply after a time
he went below and into the senior of-
ficers mess where a thin eager man
with young face and gray hair sat eat-
ing his lunch before going on watch

  randolph said the captain when
you were naval attache at berlin did
you ever run into an officer named von
arnoldt-a captain

  von arnoldt randolph frowned
it seems to me as though i did sir
i seem to recall two of them-one in
the artillery as i remember and the
other on some sort of detached duty it
seems to me i never saw that one ex-
cept in mufti sir

 that would be the man would
you know him by sight 

  i think so sir youngish chap as i
remember-perhaps thirty-five by now
he was in berlin a little while and then
off to some place or other some trop-
ical place perhaps africa sir

  captain aubrey tossed the warning
that had come anonymously out of the
air on the table read that he said
then ill tell you about it

  what shall you do sir  asked ran-
dolph when he had absorbed the mes-
sage and heard what meager facts the
captain possessed regarding it

  im going to ask permission to stop
the lampasas and send you aboard to


the popular magazine

look mr f arnold of new york
over if he is the man you remember
in berlin and the chief is willing to
take a chance on the international com-
plications well take him off and find
out what secret documents hes got
lets see were about twenty hours
north of diamond shoals at easy sail-
ing the lampasas is about ten hours
south of there if we start down the
coast within the next hour or two well
meet her easily some time to-morrow
afternoon daylight and both of us
well outside the three-mile limit ill
go and work out the message to the
chief at once

  lets hope he says yes sir said
randolph pouring another cup of tea
its been beastly dull on the station the
last fortnight sir

  what little ground swell rolled that
next noon was not enough to lift the
lampasas which forged northward as
steadily and smoothly as though riding
the surface of a pnd to the balmi-
ness of southern seas had succeeded the
tang of the north atlantic in spring-
time passengers were all out on deck
enjoying the sunshine and bracing air
but tropical white had given way to
heavy wraps and steamer rugs were
wound about the occupants of deck
chairs

  several groups with field glasses
were standing forward gazing toward
a little snub-ended ship with stubby
frame-topped masts which being not a
quarter the size of the passenger liner
felt the swell and rolled slowly at her
anchor chains they had come near
enough so  the spectators with the
strongest glasses could make out the
legend diamond shoals painted in
white man-high letters across her
sides

  no land was in sight or would be
for some hours it is more than four-
teen miles seaward from cape hatteras
to where at the edge of the shoals the

lightship swings to give its perpetual
warning of danger and serve as guide-
post for craft that fare along the coast

  the lampasas came up to the light-
ship and drew abeam not more than a
half mile separated the moving ship
and the stationary one the passengers
on the liner could imagine the expres-
sion of wistfulness upon the faces of
the light keepers who leaned upon the
nearer bulwark and waved their hands
both ships saluted as the lampasas
came opposite

  the second officer in charge on the
bridge spoke to the helmsman 

  make her notheast by noth half
east

  notheast by noth half east sir
replied the sailor at the wheel his eyes
not leaving the compass

 the lampasas swung on her new
course passengers chattered of home
and landing and the customs in less
than twenty-four hours they would be
docking in new york captain steele
spyglass in hand remained on the
bridge from time to time he stared
through the glass at distant ships and
smudges of smoke it was approaching
three in the afternoon when he low-
ered the telescope shut its eyepiece with
a snap and set his lips in a tight line

  the time was at hand when he would
learn whether he had served his coun-
try or committed a great blunder
rising above the horizon dead ahead
under military masts that showed above
trailing smoke were the gray bows of
a british cruiser

  the  war vessel came about and
headed northward as the lampasas ap-
proached then drew in closer to the
american ship and broke out a string
of signal flags

  they want us to stop and let them
come aboard sir translated the ex-
ecutive officer who had been decipher-
ing the message from the international
code book

  all right said captain steele he
a fourfoud game



stepped personally to the engine-room
telegraph and swung it to stop
lower the port gangway he ordered

  as both vessels riding side by side at
a distance of barely five hundred yards
lost their momentum and came to a
standstill a launch dropped into the
water from the middlesex and came
toward the lampasas

  the passengers on the liner had been
interested and curious spectators
word that a warship was in sight had
quickly passed from deck to saloons
and staterooms and every one had come
out to see one of the vessels that they
all vaguely knew were maintaining a
patrol off the american coast when
the middlesex came about and ran up
her string of flags interest increased
and with the stopping of the lampasas
and the lowering of the cruisers boat
a feeling of mild excitement pervaded
the company

  braxton since noon had been keep-
ing his eyes open for the approaching
war vessel he had felt reasonably
sure the commander in chief of the
patrol could not resist the opportunity
opened up to him by the anonymous
radiogram nevertheless a great feel-
ing of relief passed over him when the
middlesex finally appeared from that
moment he tried not to let von arnoldt
out of his sight

  the strategy of his call for the brit-
ish ship was somewhat involved he
was not at all sure the britishers would
go so far as to make von arnoldt a
prisoner with the possibility of thereby
developing another trent affair
but if they should do so he was
gambling von arnoldt would not
take the secret papers with him this
would naturally mean that he would
intrust them again to esther lynde
and the prime ingenuity of the
stratagem lay in this that von arnoldt
would not know when the cruisers boat
approached whether or not he was to be
apprehended he would therefore dis-

pose of the cipher before the boarding
party arrived hence if he observed
closely enough and had a moderate
average of luck braxton believed he
would know before the closing of the
afternoons incident exactly where to
put his hands upon the package and its
present appearance

  the chance had to be taken of
course that the german would risk
keeping the cipher on his person in the
face of possible capture if this should
come about and if von arnoldt should
be taken aboard the british ship there
still remained a possibility that eng-
land gaining possession of the cipher
might be willing to show her friendli-
ness for america by allowing agents
of the service to have a copy this in
view of the anglo-japanese entente
was a dubious possibility and waite
did riot seriously consider it he was
banking really on his judgment of
men and his knowledge of von
arnoldt the german was too good a
craftsman to take so desperate a chance
of the documents falling into his ene-
mies hands when he could avoid it
merely by handing them to the girl

  the middlesex was in plain sight
coming to meet the lampasas when
miss lynde came out on deck brax-
ton who had been watching for her
appearance joined her a few minutes
later von arnoldt appeared he
looked quickly in the direction toward
which all the passengers eyes were
turned he saw braxton and the girl
at about the same moment and came to
them

  a coast policeman i see he re-
marked pleasantly i wonder what
they are doing so far south my im-
pression was that the patrol ships kept
pretty close to sandy hook

  they discussed the approaching gray
vessel idly wondering whither it was
bound making guesses as to its name
speculating on its speed the german
naturally showed the same casual in-


the popular magazine

terest as the other passengers and no
more not until the lampasas stopped
and the launch from the cruiser darted
toward them did he have any reason to
feel uneasiness then although he
could not possibly know that h m s
middlesex was personally interested in
him ordinary common sense told him
that any german aboard the liner might
be in danger

  neither his courtly bearing nor his
pleasant smile disappeared braxton
scrutinizing him closely without seem-
ing to do so sensed a hardening of his
eyes a tensing of the muscles of his
jaw a little white line of determination
that appeared at the corners of his
nose he stood smilingly thoughtful
until the approaching launch was within
less than a hundred yards and the file
of armed men as well as the trim erect
gray-haired officer in the stern could be
plainly distinguished

  suddenly he raised his field glasses
and studied the features of the british
officer a shadow that had in it some-
thing of fatalism flitted for a second
only across his face he shrugged his
shoulders ever so slightly then mur-
muring a word or two of apology he
turned quietly away

  braxton thought he was about to go
below and was making ready to fol-
low him when von arnoldt with his
back to the group stepped into a cor-
ner and began unbuttoning his coat
from the appearance of his back and
the motion of his shoulders and elbows
braxton judged he was going deep into
the clothing over his breast-certainly
inside his waistcoat and probably in-
side his shirt

  when he turned to face them again
he was putting something in the outer
right-hand pocket of his overcoat it
was dark in color and for a moment
waite thought it might be a pistol
then he saw the upper corner of an
oblong leather case such as many gov-
ernment attaches use for carrying dis-

patches such cases braxton knew
are often heavily loaded along one edge
with lead he gathered this one to be
so as it sagged the pocket weightily

  still smiling his attractive courteous
smile von arnoldt came back ot their
little group quickly yet without no-
ticeable haste he lost no time but
touched miss lyndes arm obeying
his touch and gesture she drew a step
aside with him braxton could hear a
word or two of what he said-spoken
in german

     in danger perhaps one
cannot tell i have      
and keep it safe until   

  he saw miss lynde smile up at the
german and nod speaking a word or
two that did not reach him von
arnoldts hand came out of his pocket
bearing the case he slipped it quickly
into the girls hand she concealed it
inside the front of her loose storni coat

  von arnoldt and the girl stepped
back to where waite stood looking
down at the launch which was now
passing around to the other side of the
ship the conversation and transfer
had not taken a minute

  captain steele met the officer from
the middlesex and they went up the
steps to the captains room the file of
sailors remaining near the gangwtay

  five minutes passed while the decks
buzzed with guesses probable possible
and wild then captain steele and the
officer returned down the stairs and
stood for a moment on the starboard
side facing aft several groups were
along the rail between them and von
arnoldt the gray-haired english of-
ficer whose face was young and eager
turned to captain steele

  you need not introduce me to mr
arnold thank you he said pleasantly
i know him very wrell indeed

  still smiling he approached the spot
where the german leaned against the
bulwark braxton just behind him the
girl on his left
a fourfold game



  captain von arnoldt he said
clearly i have to ask you to return
with me to my ship

  how do you do randolph said
von arnoldt as pleasantly as the other
i havent seen you for a long time
and i dont think you can do it

  why not

  i am under the american flag sail-
ing from one neutral port to another-
therefore on american soil i call on
captain steele for protection

  i have already protested mr-er-
von arnoldt said the captain but
this officer says he insists upon taking
you off of course i shall enter the
circumstance in the log together with
the fact of my protest and inform the
authorities as soon as i dock

  there was a murmur of protest from
the passengers he cant do it was
the tenor of their complaint

  the british officer blew a shrill
whistle two sailors came promptly
around to his side

  i am sorry to put you to this trou-
ble captain he said bowing to cap-
tain steele i am carrying out my
orders however our respective gov-
ernments can settle the matter at their
leisure i ask you to allow me to enter
captain von arnoldts stateroom-re-
serving whatever protest you choose of
course-and take his luggage with us
and now sir to the german we are
holding our good friends off their
schedule

 von arnoldt spoke to captain
steele i shall expect you to bring
this outrage to the attention of the ger-
man embassy at once

  a little white-faced rat of a room
steward english if dialect spoke for
anything had been standing in one of
the doorways between deck and saloon
since before the middlesex broke out
her signals at this moment his un-
neutrality manifested itself

  edging around the knots of pas-

sengers to a point not far from the brit-
ish officer he squeaked

  i sy sir just before you come
abahd e give a big wallet looked as if
it might be important pipers to er e
did

  the stewards shaking finger was
pointed at esther lynde what hap-
pened then took not ten seconds

  quick give it back snapped von
arnoldt under his breath and as miss
lynde seemed to hesitate or not to un-
derstand he snatched the case from
her hand which was holding it in the
loose front of her coat with what
amounted to the same motion so rapid
that no one had a chance to stop him
the german flipped his wrist and the
lead-weighted black packet went over
the side into the sea

  pig dog he gritted in his native
tongue at the steward then recover-
ing himself instantly he bowed suavely
to miss lynde

  dear lady he murmured may
we soon meet again

  he stood erect threw back his shoul-
ders and smiled without a tremor into
the face of the english officer to whom
he spoke in that gentlemans own
tongue

  i am at your service randolph
and under his breath he uttered a curse

chapter x

shattered sympathy

  it was late-nearly midnight for
hours since the interruption of their
voyage by the middlesex the screws
had been throbbing steadily the sky
had become overcast at sunset and a
storm was brewing rapidly out of the
northeast with promise of rough
weather before morning the lam-
pasas heading into the wind was rising
and falling to the oncoming swell with
spray now and then breaking over her
bows


the popular magazine

  sailors had long since gone about the
decks making everything fast in an-
ticipation of a blow they had taken in
all the deck chairs save one situated
quite well forward on the lee side of the
ship which was occupied by a silent
muffled figure

  braxton had been there ever since
the rising sea had sent most of the
passengers to bed and the whistling
wind had driven into the cabins the few
that gave no heed to bad weather an
hour two hours had passed and he had
not moved he was going over what
had passed that day over and over and
blaming himself he had foreseen
every contingency and provided against
it-except one why couldnt he have
thought that the german might consign
his secret to the sea  why hadnt he
done something to prevent it

  when von arnoldt gave the dis-
patch case to miss lynde waite had
counted his stratagem successful for
a few moments he had praised himself
-patted himself on the back he re-
membered with shame-esteemed him-
self to be a rather clever fellow while
he was watching the admirable nerve
with which von arnoldt met the
emergency he was at the same time be-
ginning to plan his next move by which
he should secure the papers from the
girl after the german had gone his
next move and that one so poorly
planned and executed that von arnoldt
ruined it with one flip of his muscular
wrist

  except when the ship smashed down
into an unusually heavy sea the deck
on the lee side where braxton sat was
quiet somewhere aft of him a door
opened letting a shaft of light out
across a procession of toppling white-
caps it was a late player leaving the
smoking room and he heard the mans
half-serious half-jocular explanation
of his departure to those who remained

  no sir the voice was saying im
going to quit and go to bed i know

when ive got enough me im a rot-
ten poker player

  some unintelligible repartee and
laughter in which the first speaker
joined followed then the door shut
and again there was silence

  that goes for me too declared
braxton to himself im a rotten
player ive gummed this game from
start to finish and now that cipher is
at the bottom of the sea and ive got
to start back for mexico city-if the
chief will let me-and try it all over
again and all this time lost

  he writhed in spirit as he saw him-
self making his report to the chief not
that he anticipated reproaches for in
advance he knew there probably would
be none hard luck the chief would
say and plan with him to recoup the
chief would realize he had tried his
best but what good is a best that
fails  im a well-meaning young
man he sneered thus calling himself
one of the worst of names in a world
where deeds are measured by success

  he knew he could not sleep and the
rising wind and sea jibed with his
mood he was filled with humiliation
and self-reproach a tyro at the great
game he told himself could have done
no worse

  a figure came forward along the
deck it stood almost over him before
he was aware of it

  mr braxton

  the voice was esther lyndes in a
moment he was on his feet she de-
clined to take his chair he stood be-
side her against the rail still sheltered
from the wind

  she had been unable to sleep the
impending storm the exciting events of
the day some bit of unexplainable nerv-
ousness added to these she said made
her wakeful she had come out to
walk about in the air he gathered she
had known somehow that he was still
outside
a fourfold game



  they braced themselves against the
rail swinging with the ship and stood
for a long time for a while they
talked but little braxton felt drawn
to the girl by a new bond-that of sym-
pathy she too he realized had borne
a loss and a shock in the days happen-
ings she too was suffering that
night the pangs of failure

  by and by she began to speak of von
arnoldt she wondered what would
become of him whether washington
would set in motion the machinery of
protest that would free him or he was
doomed to spend the remainder of the
war in some british prison camp she
spoke of the package he had given her
and wondered-as was the natural atti-
tude for her to take-what it contained
that he guarded so closely adding that
in intrusting it to her charge he had
merely said its contents were important
to him and such that he did not want
them to fall into the hands of the brit-
ish government

  braxtqn talked these things over with
her sympathetically he felt she was
in a mood not dissimilar from his own
she wanted to forget the disappoint-
ments the day had wrought to get away
from her thoughts of what might have
been done

  he bore in mind in talking with her
that she did not know he had been
aware von arnoldt was an officer and
expressed a moderate degree of sur-
prise that the german was now in
active service while saying he had pre-
sumed from the mans carriage and
manner that in earlier years he had
done his bit with the military establish-
ment he made sundry vague hazards
as to what might have been in the
weighted leather case because he felt
she wanted comforting-and because
although the necessities of the game
had made him do the thing that had
brought about von arnoldts capture
he nevertheless admired the german
for a good player-he spoke most sym-

pathetically of von arnoldts plight
and did not mean it hypocritically

  they were singularly drawn together
that night in the gathering storm
often afterward the recollection came
back to him with bitterness of how
softened he had felt how comradely
how attracted by the softness and fem-
ininity of her-a woman a good deal
alone and in trouble he wanted to
soothe her to lessen her unhappiness
he did not forget the gulf of duty that
separated them he did not let his sym-
pathy rob him of discretion or loosen
his tongue but he turned his back on
the chasm so far as he could and
thought of her as her

  if only they served the same cul-
ture and ideals how different he
thought the future of both of them
might be and but for the gulf that
he turned away from but could not-
must not-forget he would have come
near to telling her then that she ap-
pealed to him as women had not
appealed to him before for in his hu-
miliation and chagrin his need for sym-
pathy and love it had come to him on
the wings of the wind that this was a
woman of a thousand but so long as
he and she served such different mas-
ters not only his tongue was tied but
even his heart

  thus softened he felt a fierce satis-
faction in the rising wind and ever-
increasing sea they were together a
strong man and a strong woman breast-
ing it unafraid he delighted in the
plunges of the ship which was begin-
ning to buck the higher-rolling billows
he gave no heed to passing time so
long as they stood here together things
would go on just as they were at this
minute when once they left the deck
to go below life would never be the
same he did not deceive himself he
could not continue to be pleasantly
friendly with esther lynde and noth-
ing more hence because more was
out of the question they would part on


the tpopulltr magazine

the morrow and he would make up his
mind to forget

  a long curling wave higher and big-
ger than any that had come before
rushed down on the ship which rose to
top it staggered upon its brink and
plunged headlong into the trough be-
yond there was a jar and shiver as
the bows impacted with the following
wave drove beneath it and lifted shud-
dering to shed tons of green water

  swinging to keep their balance the
girl and braxton held tight to the rail
before them she reeled a little at the
shock of the breaking sea and he
though she had lost her hold and put
out a hand to steady her it touched
her fingers the contact was magnetic
for a second their hands clasped then
almost rudely he snatched his away
if he did not he knew he should for-
get the gulf throw down the barriers
and take her in his arms

  it was some moments after this that
she broke the silence her voice was
low as though she too had felt the
emotion that thrilled him at the acci-
dental touch her tone was warmer
closer than it ever had been before

 somehow-right now-- she
hesitated for expression if you had
an opportunity to do me a kindness
would you do it  before he could
answer she burst out impulsively i
need a friend could you be one
could i depend upon you

  the appeal thrilled him whatever

i could do- he said there was no

need for him to finish the sentence the
emotion in his voice spoke for the sin-
cerity of his assurance

  she went on hurriedly as though her
words were forcing themselves to be
spoken

  i have something to do-it is very
simple-and i am afraid i dont know
why but i am nervous i want you
to help me it is a little thing but
i-

  he could not see her eyes but he felt
them fixed on him

  when they came so suddenly this
afternoon and seized mr arnoldt and
he had to give up whatever it was he
had it frightened me i guess i
havent got over it i am-somehow-
timid and i am not used to feeling

timid if you-

  she hesitated then went on with a
plunge

  i have a little package of papers
that are very important very important
indeed if i were to lose them it
would be very serious i cannot- tell
you how serious i hadnt thought it
possible i would be afraid to carry
them but there are the customs offi-
cials-and others some one might open
the envelope and great harm might
come of it to-to the people i repre-
sent that experience this afternoon
made me realize what could happen if
by some accident things of that sort
should fall into the wrong hands

  you have said you will do what you
can to help me listen mr braxton
will you take this envelope that i have
and keep it for me until after we are
safely in new york will you it is
really a little thing-and yet i assure
you it is an important thing

  braxtons mind whirled but he had
to reply he used language to conceal
thoughts saying the first thing that
seemed a plausible remark you-you
are not asking me to help smuggle
something

  no i give you my word it is noth-
ing dutiable

  do you want to tell me anything
more-as to the character of these im-
portant documents i mean

  she hesitated the length of time it
took the ships rail to swing through an
arc of forty degrees

  it is a-business matter she said
in a voice that rang less true yes a
business matter but a very serious
one
a fourfold game



  waites words were all she could
have wished but his tones also had
taken a different timbre

  you honor me by trusting me and i
shall be glad to do it

  i will give you the envelope to-night
when there will be nobody to see us-
it is strange how nervous this has made
me-and to-morrow if you will after
the boat has docked i want you to meet
me just as soon as possible and return
it say in two hours after we have
landed i will go my way and you can
go yours after we have docked i-i
might be followed if you were to re-
turn them on the pier or on the street
some one might see it and something
might happen then in two hours i

will be- she thought quickly

can you meet me at the van
wouter

  he answered affirmatively with a
wrord he must not let her guess a
single one of his thoughts

  in that little reception room near
the main dining room she went on i
will be there two hours after we dock
whatever time that may be we can-
not set the hour any nearer than that
this head wind will probably delay us
and oh i thank you so much it is
foolish i know for me to be so nerv-
ous but you are taking a great load
from my mind

  he spoke with what naturalness he
could assume although he felt as one
might who has been suddenly immersed
in an ice-cold bath

  this envelope you have it with
you now i mean

  yes when we go in out of the
wind i will get it

  it is getting too rough for comfort
and it is very late suppose we go in
now

  for a second in the darkness she
tried to scan his face as some under-
lying change in his manner impressed
her consciousness but there was no
outward difference in his bearing she

turned and they made their way to
the nearest door holding firmly to the
rail and each other against the increas-
ing violence of the ships rolling

  she paused with her back to him a
moment after they had come into the
narrow passageway and when she
faced him there was in her hand a long
white envelope as thick as might be
necessary to hold a-dozen or so pages
of moderately heavy letter sheets

  she passed it to him at once yet he
felt as though notwithstanding the cir-
cumstances her fingers were reluctant
to let the package go	

 please put it in your pocket
quickly she said where no one can
see it it is absurd i suppose-but all
this evening i have had the feeling
that some one was watching me plan-
ning to steal this from me important
papers one can never tell what ends
a rival in business will go to to secure
them but of course you know this
better than i do being with a big busi-
ness concern yourself

  waite bowed his acquiescence he
did not want to speak to trust his voice
he hardly dared trust his eyes the
muscles of his face it was with dif-
ficulty that he said the natural thing
and said it naturally

  you may depend upon it i shall
guard it as carefully as though it were
my own and-if we have no oppor-
tunity to speak about it in the morning
-two hours after we dock i shall be
on hand to restore it to you at the van
wouter

  his hand steadying her she walked
to the door of her stateroom there in
the gloom of a single low-candle-
powered globe that lit the corridor she
looked into his eyes again for a mo-
ment he thought she was going to say
something of importance impulsively
then she changed her mind perhaps
and gave him her hand

  good night she said simply i
thank you very very much


the pocpular magazine

  coming to his own stateroom he en-
tered closed the door and drew from
his pocket the package

  it was a plain envelope of stout
linen-backed paper of an unusual size
a trifle larger than such envelopes usu-
ally are its face was blank but on
the back across the flap was written
in bluish ink the girls autograph
fastened with glfte to withstand the
wear of long journeys such an envelope
is not easily opened in fact he noted
at once this one could not be steamed
open at all without the process leaving
its trace upon the signature

  turning it over in his hand he al-
most expected to see upon its corner a
bright-red stain now growing brown
this was nonsense of course the
merest amateur could have been de-
pended upon to destroy that telltale en-
velope and substitute another but he
knew without the blood smear to
identify it what was inside this pack-
age he was as sure in his heart as
though the contents lay spread before
him that the sheets bore rows and rows
of roman numerals probably ten to the
line for in such form are practically all
national codes at last gained in the
most incredible manner he had in his
hands the cipher message that had sent
colonel calderon to his death

  he buttoned the envelope inside his
breast and went out on deck again
he wanted to think and with the tu-
multuous riot of thoughts that were
piling one upon the other in his brain
it was fitting he should thresh out his
bitterness of spirit in the teeth of the
driving northeaster

chapter xi

the bitterness of success

  braxton was not one of those fickle
souls who having gained a thing no
longer desire it and yet-

  for weeks he had concentrated his
every faculty upon the securing of this

message its acquisition meant vital
things to the country he served he
had planned and schemed and devoted
every power of mind he possessed
solely to the end of getting this docu-
ment into his possession less than
two hours ago because he thought he
had failed he had wallowed in the
deepest depths of self-condemnation
now he had succeeded-and success
tasted more bitter in his mouth than
failure

  his emotions during the hour they
stood by the rail together came back to
him his sympathy his feeling of com-
radeship the effort he had been forced
to make to keep from declaring his love
and all that hour he now told himself
unmercifully she had been shrewdly
playing to make him a cats-paw

  of how it had come about that the
cipher remained in her hands he could
only guess and his mind worked dully
as to that there might have been two
copies but it would not have been be-
yond von arnoldts cleverness to pre-
pare an empty case to throw over the
side in such an emergency as had arisen
braxton remembered that esther had
concealed the black leather package be-
neath her coat from the time the ger-
man passed it to her until he snatched
it back again to toss it into the sea
who knew when it came to that that
the case he had seized from her hand
was the same one he had given her a
few minutes before

  why on the eve of their entrance
into port she had now given the papers
into braxtons keeping was only too
clear to him as he reviewed the events
of the day and built up the logical trend
of her reasoning

  neither she nor von arnoldt when
they left mexico had supposed any
one knew they were german secret
agents von arnoldts capture meant
to her mind that some one had identi-
fied him and warned the british patrol
-somebody she would probably pre-
a foijcrfoud game



sume back in mexico and if him
why not her was it not reasonable
for her to think that warning had been
sent out regarding both a british
patrol ship might take from a neutral
vessel an officer of the german army
it would hardly dare interfere with a
woman passenger would it not be
the natural thing then that warning
in her case should be given the united
states authorities  and would they
not seek to seize her papers when she
entered the country through a search
by customs officials

  this waite figured must have been
her reasoning ingeniously she had se-
lected him a well-mannered american
presumably chivalric to bear her
burden through the gates to accom-
plish this she had deliberately estab-
lished between them the feeling of un-
derstanding that had well-nigh swept
him off his feet and i fell for it
he muttered like a boy

  he stood with set jaw full in the
lashing wind he felt terribly cynical
sophisticated disillusioned-older by
far and more experienced than he had
ever felt before

  the ships bell struck two oclock 
according to landsmens time from
somewhere on deck there came torn
and twisted in the storm the call of a
lookout

  four bells and al-l-ls well and al--
lights lit and burnin

  as though the ringing of the hour
were a signal a torrent of rain burst
from the low-hanging clouds while the
wind increased and the ship seemed to
settle herself to the nights work of
shouldering her headlong way through
the piling seas waite set his shoul-
ders shook himself and turned to go
below he had made up his mind to
put the matter from him it was as
though he shook himself mentally as he
did physically his pride came to his
rescue he would do his duty and let

the world go hang the game he tried
to believe was bigger than any woman

  he made up his mind to forget-
and he knew in his heart that he never
never would

  if he had slept lightly there were
few marks of it in his face and bear-
ing when he came on deck after break-
fast even had he looked a wreck from
sleeplessness he would have attracted
little attention it was on the whole
a weary and depressed-looking ships
company that straggled into view after
the lampasas passed the narrows
comparatively few had shown up in
the dining room that morning many
did not appear until the ship was glid-
ing up the river to her dock

  braxton had no opportunity for a
word alone with miss lynde before
they went ashore she had been caring
for the seasick mrs carson it ap-
peared  both the carsons looking much
the worse for wear were with her as
the boat approached the pier he was
glad of this it took his best self-con-
trol as it was to meet her with his
usual manner but he felt when the
ordeal was past that he had succeeded

  it was two oclock in the afternoon
when he passed from the pier to the
street this left him until four to do
the things he had to do before meeting
esther at the van wouter to return her
the envelope in accordance with his
promise

  a taxicab the driver doing every-
thing he could to make time short of
getting arrested and losing it bumped
him across to the van wouter he
hastily engaged a room and the mo-
ment he was alone in it called by tele-
phone a number that is not to be found
in the telephone directory

  mr cameron please he said when
a voice at the other end had repeated
the number without otherwise identify-
ing the location then after a mo-
ment mr cameron    all
right i recognize your voice now this


the vopular magazine

is braxton i am coming to see you
at your office right away

and say can you have some clerks at
liberty    oh a whole flock of
them eight or ten if youve got them

   all right good-by

   he stopped at the hotel office to leave
word that if miss lynde called for him
in the reception room she was to be in-
formed he had gone out on an im-
portant business matter and expected
to return very soon after four this
wras in case he should be unable to get
back by that hour

  he went dowmtown in the subway
and got a taxicab from the exit to the
office of the service when he entered
that building it was with leisurely man-
ner  it had to be remembered that but
one attache of the new york branch
beside cameron its head knew his of-
ficial identity word had been left in
the outer office he was taken to the
inner one without delay

  take a seat mr braxton glad to
see you said the chief then as they
were alone whats broken i gather
youre in a tremendous hurry

  youve said something ill explain

later first- he threw on the

table the sealed envelope can you
exactly match that envelope-in an
hour 

  im pretty sure we can it is an
american-made envelope and a stand-
ard size although an unusual one
wvve got a lot of linen envelopes in
the office-we might be able to match it
right here wait a minute

  he stepped from the room bearing
the sealed envelope and returned
quickly with it and a plain empty en-
velope in his hand he passed them
to braxton they were as alike as
tweedledum and tweedledee

  great now before we do anything
else have you got a forger handy that
can duplicate exactly this signature
across the flap

  i can have one here in half an hour

-one of our women agents shes a
wonder with a pen

  braxton took his penknife from his
pocket then well see whats in this
-and if its what i think it is your
clerks are going to get a chance to be
mighty busy

   he slit the package carefully

   inside were fourteen sheets of paper
there was not a word of decipherable
writing each sheet bore rows and
rows of roman numerals ten to the
line

  here you are he said i want a
couple of copies of this made-youd
better give one or two sheets to each
clerk to save time-and have it care-
fully read by copy to see there are no
errors you see what it is and if you
havent happened to hear where ive
been ill tell you-mexico city for
the love of goodness dont let a drop
of ink get spilled on these sheets or a
wrinkle get put in them that isnt there
now i want to get the copies ready to
take over to washington to-night and
ive got to get this original back into
the envelope your pretty little forgery
performed across the flap and have the
whole business uptown in-he con-
sulted his watch--one hour and five
minutes wthat are the chances -

  cameron wras already out of his
-chair heading toward the next room
if the subway doesnt cave in or the
trains break down youll have five min-
utes to spare he said

  and now said waiter when cam-
eron came back with word that the
work of copying was already under
way and the expert pen woman had
been sent for and would arrive in time
will you get the chief on the private
wire after youve put in the call ill
give you an idea what its all about

  in the explanation that he made to
cameron braxton did not tell how he
had secured the cipher message that
was now being so laboriously and care-
fully duplicated this was a detail an
a foucrfolcd game



agent would be unlikely to discuss with
any one save the chief and cameron
asked no questions accepting such part
of the story as braxton saw fit to tell
him he had outlined his quest for
the japanese note and explained that
he had nothing more than suspicion as
to what the message contained and no
way of reading it-that being a detail
washington could be depended upon
to perform-when an electric buzzer
sounded and cameron picked up the
telephone receiver

  heres washington he said to
braxton the chief will be on the
wire in a minute    hello
hello chif cameron talking heres
eccles chief eccles    yes
he wants to talk to you

  he pushed the instrument across to
waite

  hello called braxton

  how do you do mr eccles came
in the chiefs unruffled tones glad to
hear your voice

  same to you sir i have some pa-
pers that should interest you i ought
to be able to leave this evening with
them

  plain or in code 

 code im having copies made
now i dont know the translation of
course

  have you got to see me or is your
work cleaned up for the moment
why-er-i guess its cleaned up
these papers ought to speak for them-
selves

  good im going to ask you if you
dont mind to put off your detailed re-
port for the present and keep on the
run is there any reason why you cant
leave new york right away-to be gone
three or four weeks

  no none whatever

  its mighty lucky-your getting in
to-day ive got some documents that
must go to stevenson in france-you
know where to find him you and he
know each other and i havent got an-
b p

other man handy of which that is true
will you run over-theres a boat to-
morrow-and put these into his hands
personally you know what hes doing
so you can appreciate the importance of
the errand

  why of course but what about
this other business what shall i do
with these copies

  ill send williams over to new
york on the next train with the pack-
age for stevenson shall you be at
rour home or the club the van wou-
ter all right williams will be there
to hand them to you in person you
give him whatever papers you have
for me and he will bring them over
here on the first train to-morrow

  all right sir

  that all

  all i can think of

  all right good luck im sorry i
cant give you a minutes rest between
trips this time good-by

  waite replaced the receiver on the
hook and looked at cameron whim-
sically a mere matter of a three or
four weeks trip to europe starting to-
morrow he said and no chance for
me to find out before i go whats in this
cipher oh well its all in the days
work and i may never be told ex-
actly whats in it anyway-there are
some things the state department has
to keep entirely to itself and i
shouldnt be surprised if this were one
of them i wonder how those handy
helpers of yours are coming on

  at three minutes of four oclock
braxton entered the little reception
room near the main dining room at the
hotel van wouter two minutes later
esther lynde came in

  as he rose to meet her he took from
his inner pocket an envelope of linen-
backed paper about as thick as might
be necessary to hold a dozen or so
pages of moderately heavy letter sheets
and passed it to her with the air of one


the tpotpullcr magazine

who has been glad to do a courteous
but not very important errand

 as she thanked him with what
seemed to be deep and real appreciation
of the service she turned it over in her
hands and glanced casually at the back
across the flap was written in bluish
ink her own autograph

  he murmured regrets that he must
be hurrying away to keep an engage-
ment as she gave him her hand she
said

  i hope we shall meet again-some
time

  fate will be unkind if we do not
he answered with formal gallantry he
smiled his most pleasant smile it has
been a delightful acquaintanceship

  he watched her as she swung com-
petently down the street her eyes
were no longer upon him and he was
no longer smiling

chapter xii

enter universal oil

  twenty-two days later the indian-
apolis westbound from liverpool was
reported as passing nantucket light-
ship to waite braxton reading in a
deck chair came an hour or two after
ward a steward bringing a wireless
message it was dated from washing-
ton and signed simply by three letters
none of which was an initial of the
chiefs name it read

  immediately upon arrival arrange meeting
between eccles and cameron at latters
office

  immediately when the chief said
it meant exactly what it said braxton
therefore telephoned cameron from the
pier and followed his telephone mes-
sage instantly in person

  welcome to our city said cam-
eron the moment the door was closed
then laughingly why the old cap
collier disguise

  he referred to a professional-ap-
pearing beard clipped on the cheeks

  and growing to what would ultimately
be a point that was nearly three weeks
old and already looked twice that age

  oh this  grinned wtaite passing
his hand over his chin i started it the
day i left here you see going to find
stevenson i traveled from london on
doctors papers and i thought while i
was about it id look the part then i
let it stay on coming across thought id
keep it a while and see how id look i
fancy my friends will kid the life out
of me for the next week and ill prob-
ably take it off again rather foolish
idea anyway raising a beard when
they arent in style and with summer
coming on

  i think when i get through talking
to you youll leave it on said cam-
eron seriously it just fits the pro-
gram

   what program 

  well in the first place the chief
left yesterday to make a trip with the
president who is going to make some
speeches in the middle west and hes
going to be so worried for the next
week over the presidents safety that
he wont have time to think of anything
else at least as regards details these
are dangerous days for a presidential
trip

  he wanted to see you but couldnt
wait of course hes got a job lie
wants you to do right away so he
sent for me to come over to washing-
ton and asked me to meet you on your
arrival express his regrets and set you
right at it

  not any more traveling i hope i
havent done anything else for the past
two months

  not much traveling about three
days but plenty of work on the other
end of the journey as i figure it
break it to me 

  san antonio

well one gets bathrooms good
food and human society in san an-
a foucrfolcd game



tonio it could have been port au
prince whats up in santone

  thats it the chief hasnt been
able to find out but something some-
thing new

  some new revolutionary bee do you
mean 

  i dont know its a new junta of
some sort but its run by a different
crowd not cientificos not huertistas
not carranzixtas we are sure of that
the boss of the crowd is named pablo
sauceda but the only line payne has
been able to get on him thus far is that
he used to be a villa general and villa
now-youve heard about what hap-
pened at columbus new mexico while
you were gone i suppose

  yes and that at last weve gone
across but payne is he in san an-
tonio now

  hes been there a little better than
a fortnight the chief ordered him up
and he came from mexico city to san
antonio via eagle pass had a sur-
prisingly safe trip incidentally but he
hasnt been able to get at the bottom
of the thing says there isnt a man
concerned in it who isnt a mexican
payne speaks spanish perfectly you
know but he doesnt look like anything
but a yankee this job calls for a man
who can pass himself off for a don
hence my remark that the new crop
of alfalfa behind which you are en-
deavoring to hide might come in
handy

  bradon passed his hand meditatively
over the stubble on his face gee
he exclaimed that sounds like some
job i suppose there are five or ten
thousand mexican refugees in san an-
tonio theres a proud chance there
isnt  somebody in that crowd who
knows me well by sight at least and
it is the fellow who knows me by sight
and whom i dont know by sight that
is dangerous

  yes its likely to be a hard job
but the chief said you are the one man

  to tackle it i fancy those refugees
hang around certain hotels and clubs
youll have to keep away from those
places as much as you can i suppose
however im not trying to tell you
what to do after you get there thats
your business besides im no ex-
pert in spanish diplomacy you know
it takes all my time to try to keep
posted on wthat is going on in little old
new york the chief said telegraph
payne when youre coming and hell
run up the line a few hundred miles and
talk over the situation then youll be
better able to judge how to go into the
town and what to do after you get
there

  all right sighed waite ill go to
it right away to-morrow if you think
that is all right i dont imagine the
chief thinks it necessary for me to get
out to-night

  no he said he would like to have
you leave to-morrow unless there was
some important personal matter you
wanted to get out of the way here in
which case the next dayr would do and
theres one more thing it may be im-
portant and it may not take it for
what it is worth

  five days ago payne telegraphed
that a mexican named andres azcona a
member of this new junta or whatever
it is had left san antonio for new
york and asked us to get a line on
him azcona came here according to
schedule and we kept track of him
from the minute he arrived until he
left-this morning he was here two
days he saw one man three times and
nobody else and he spent all the re-
mainder of his visit in his room in the
beekman house except for going to
the theater one evening all by his lone-
some and wandering for an hour or
two afterward up and down the great
white way-also all by himself

  who was the man he saw three
times 

  jerry stedman


the cpovulatr magazine

  braxton whistled

  old jerry where 

  twice at the universal oil and once
at azconas hotel

  stedman went to see him at his
hotel 

  yes it takes a pretty important
visitor to make the old man do that
um waite thought deeply i
guess it is just as well i dont have to
leave for the southwest before to-mor-
row night theres a loose end or two
i may be able to pick up here you
have telegraphed payne i suppose
sure

  ill see what i can dig and talk it
over with him when we meet you
might send a code telegram to payne
if you dont mind asking him to meet
me in dallas to-day is friday ill
meet him there--at the hotel adelphi
-monday night dallas is a good town
for us to get together in mighty few
mexican refugees get as far north in
texas as that ill be much obliged if
youll translate his reply when it comes
and send it over you can reach me
this evening or to-morrow up to noon
at my house and give me the exact
dope on what this azcona did all the
time he was in town

  all right

  braxton got up to leave paused and
stared unseeingly out of the window

  jerry stedman he mused half to
himself maybe i wont have to lie
doggo cultivate whiskers and dodge
the bright lights after all working in
san antonio and trying to keep off the
main streets and away from the big
hotels would be about as cheerful as a
summer vacation spent in vera cruz
well ill get along let me know when
you hear from payne please

  he telephoned his father and found
the old gentleman would be at home to
dinner at eight the usual hour at
eight-forty-five when the servants had
brought cigars and left the dining room
they ceased talking of casual things

  well boy rumbled mr braxton
inquiringly hows it going first i
get a line from you from mexico then
i hear that you landed into town one
day when i was in chicago and
couldnt wait then you write a non-
committal note from london and now
you tell me youre here to-day and gone
to-morrow if you worked as hard at
my business as you do at yours youd
make a hundred thousand a year
whats the use so long as ive got
more than ill ever need i might just
be blowing mohey you know there are
those who do

  all right said the old man
weve threshed all that out before
im not bringing up the old argument
-the most unprofitable thing in the
world is continuing to fight after the
fight is over as a matter of fact im
not sorry these days that youre doing
your share to try to keep things
straight although i wish you were in a
business where when you do a good
job-and i fancy you -do one once in a
while-i could hear about it and brag
some to the other old fellows how-
ever- where are you going this

time if you are allowed to tell

  san antonio

  border work eh

  well san antonio isnt exactly the
border but its handy to it i may get
down on the rio grande before i come
back you never can tell where one of
these trips of mine will wind up

  mr braxton watched a smoke ring
break itself against an incandescent in
the light dome over the table

   i hope before this present trouble is
over down there well pick up that
cursed border and walk about a thou-
sand miles south with it he said
what is it somebody or other recently
called mexico an international
nuisance 

  waite knocked the ashes from his
cigar before he spoke

  i want to ask you a question fa
a fourfold game



ther he said slowly and i dontwant
you to answer it unless you are willing
to let me make use of the reply-for
the service as the english constable
would say it is my duty to warn you
that whatever you say may be used
against you 

  lets hear it

  is jerry stedman sending money
down to texas to be used for some
angle of this mexican trouble and if
so what for

  it was the fathers turn to hesitate

  i wonder how you heard about
that he finally said i didnt believe
anybody knew it outside the syndicate
then you are in the syndicate
yep and i thought it was iron-
clad brass-bound and secret proof
yet my son lands in here from europe
at noon and tells me about it at din-
ner that is some organization youre
tied up with boy

  im going to be perfectly honest with
you dad it wouldnt be fair to be oth-
erwise i didnt knowr stedman had
sent money down to texas i only
knew a mexican named azcona jias
been here to see him and has started
back to figure that hed come after
money was a matter of adding two and
two to make four mexicans dont
come two thousand miles to see old
jerry to ask him what he thinks will
be the price of oil next october and
before i ask you any more questions i
ought to say-in the strictest confi
dence of course-that i may have to
mix in during the next week or so
with the gang this azcona is tied up
with having heard that if you can
give me any information ill appreciate
it if not-why thats all right too
of course

  this is a fine government the old
man declared with the explosiveness
that had gained him his nickname
bull braxton it wont protect
american capital in mexico and it
butts in wrhen american capital at-

tempts to protect itself in mexico
what were doing is legitimate we
want to help straighten things out so
american investments in that country
will be safe again including our own
so youre helping along one set of
saviors of the distracted republic as
the president calls it 

   distracted is right were trying
to get the mess over with we want to
see the mines opened and the railroads
running and the oil coming out we
want to see mexico safe for an amer-
ican as it was in the days when diaz
ran it

  im not going to ask you how much
money the syndicate has contributed
nor how much of the pot has been ad-
vanced to this azcona nor any other
impertinent details and i can appre-
ciate just how you feel about conditions
in mexico perhaps i agree with you
more or less inside although im not
supposed to have any sentiments one
way or the other but there is one
thing i wish you would tell me and
very seriously i want to say im not
sure it isnt as much to your interest
as it is to mine for you to give me the
straight of it perhaps more isnt it
your idea that the only solution of the
mexican problem lies either in inter-
vention or the old conservative crowd
-the cientificos 

 of course anybody who has
watched things in mexico for the past
five years ought to know that-if he is
a business man

  if there were a chance that this
money the syndicate is putting up-
these sinews of war jerry stedman
gave azcona-were not going to the

cientificos-

  what do you mean it is

  thats just the point i have a
pretty good reason for believing it
isnt

  isnt then who the devil--
that i dont know dad but i have
a tip that azconas crowd is not cien-


the popular magazine

tifico if it claims to be somebody is
getting double-crossed i might add
something-if youll lock it up in your
brain when you hear it and never let it
loose

  sure

  the leader of this new crowd is-
or was-a villista i may be wrong but
i dont believe the cientificos would
pick him for such a job

  do you mean you think jerry sted-
man is getting double-crossed 

  not necessarily it might be--

  me eh  well it might such
things have been done

  listen father said waite ear-
nestly im going down to san an-
tonio and i may have to do something
-ive no idea avhat yet because theres
a whole lot about my errand i have to
learn after i get there-that will hurt
your pocket if the syndicate is back-
ing some scheme of villas- he

paused reorganized his ideas and con-
tinued 

  whatever some of our big people
may have thought of villa a few
months ago just now he is a bandit
with a price on his head and an amer-
ican army chasing him and if he is
still living and on the job-you know
there is a rumor he has been killed but
i dont believe it the carranzistas
probably started the story and are
spreading it as an argument to try to
get pershing pullevl back north of the
border-i tell you there isnt anything
he would do that wouldnt be to the
injury of the united states and if
your associates are backing him why
ill probably be in the position of hav-
ing to try to do something that will cost
you money

  the old man rose from the table and
came around it he showed an angle
of his character that would have sur-
prised his business associates

  waite he said if you find out
when you get down there that our
money is being used in any way that

means one ounce of real injury to this
country i dont care whether some-
body is double-crossing stedman or
whether he is double-crossing me-go
to it and put a crimp in the whole gang
you know me son you know i think
weve handled this mexican situation
wrong from soda to hock and that i
dont care a hoot whether what i do
pleases the political administration or
not-in fact if the administration was
pleased id think i had overlooked a
bet and was probably making a mis-
take but hurting the country is an-
other matter

  ive got a good  many hundred
thousand dollars invested in mexico
and ive just chipped ten thousand
more into that little syndicate to chase
after it if ive been led to contribute
any money with which to do my
country harm i hope i lose it and
if youre the one to make me lose it
under those circumstances ill be proud
of you hrrumph lets you and me
go to one of those tired-business-men
shows

chapter xiii

news of old friends

  therefore leroy payne said in
braxtons room at the adelphi i
made up my mind we must have some-
body here that could try to get in with
the crowd as a mexican he had been
reviewing the same facts that braxton
had received from cameron you
seemed to me to be the one best bet

  i could do that-perhaps-if there
were nobody in the refugee colony that
knew me but i couldnt travel with
the crowd two days before somebody
would spot me as braxton and brax-
ton isnt a spanish name

  you could be a half-caste you
could claim your mother was mex-
ican

  no that wouldnt do either some-
body would take the trouble to look me
up even if they didnt already know
a foufoud game



  payne scowled gloomily at a picture
on the hotel wall-a print of homer
reciting one of his justly celebrated
pieces well i thought of all that of
course but i cant see anything else
to do that promises to get us the dope
from the inside and get it quickly
enough if im not mistaken theyre
getting ready to spring something
pretty sudden

 what

  thats it if we could find out we
could head them off its a big crowd
apparently pablo sauceda at the head
eight or ten or a dozen lieutenants and
a whole raft of subordinates they
keep coming and going these sub-
ordinates from all over south texas
and every last one of them is a mex-
ican ive tried to work some scheme
to get some of these mexicans to talk
but bribery wont land the lieutenants
and the men farther down are just
hombres for the most part theyre
mostly ignorant about just what theyre
up to or else theyve got a better rea-
son than usual for not talking

  cameron wired you about jerry
stedman 

  yes

  didnt that give you an idea as to a
way i might go to work 

  why no perhaps id my mind so
filled with the idea that you would
claim to be a mexican and do a
straight-sleuth act that i couldnt think
of anything else say waite it would
be a shame not to pretend to be a mex-
ican with that complexion and hair of
yours and those bee-yewtiful jet-black
whiskers

  luxuriant foliage isnt it
grinned braxton then seriously
suppose i were to go to this sauceda
tell him my name and that i hail from
new york and ask him to look me up
and find out who i represent i dont
tell him mind i just ask him to look
me up trust a mexican hot to go at
it directly trust him not to ask any-

body in new york-at least any
american then where would he go
to other mexicans wouldnt he and
when he found a mexican that knew
me what would the mex say

  i can guess that one the first time
hed say you were waite braxton of
the universal oil company

  then suppose when sauceda had
got that kind of a report on me i told
him i was here to represent the uni-
versal-secretly wouldnt he believe
it and suppose then i told him i
was in disguise and wanted to work
under an assumed spanish name
wouldnt he help me get away with
it

  but why the assumed name and the
mexican nationality stuff if sauceda
already knows who you are

  to get me in on a friendly basis
with the rest of the junta i have a
suspicion-sorry i cant tell you what
it is based on but theres a matter
of personal confidence involved-that
while old man stedman is in on this
play jerry doesnt know all that is
going on ive got it in my head that
this sauceda may not open his heart to
me even if he is convinced i am a rep-
resentative of the universal but he
wont dare to hurt me because the uni-
versal at present is his meal ticket
and if he takes me more or less un-
der his wing he wont warn the crowd
against me-outside of his closest fol-
lowers-and ill get a chance to do
some digging around in the gang then
if somebody who knows me puts the
subordinates wise to the fact that im
not a mexican and they run to sau-
ceda hell tell them to leave me alone
-that he knew it all the time

  that sounds like convincing dope
declared payne after a moments
thought yes sir blamed if i dont
think it has a mighty good chance to
work

  they talked over the details braxton
gathering such facts as he needed as to


the cpcpulcr magazine

the location of the new junta the
names of many of the men who seemed
to be saucedas chief lieutenants and
descriptions of them and the hotels and
clubs which were their social meeting
places sauceda himself had a smalt
house on san sebastian avenue he
learned which appeared to be the busi-
ness headquarters of the organization
two or three of his assistants lived at
the hotel bonham the remainder came
and went but mostly seemed to reside
when in san antonio in the mexican
quarter

  then they planned where braxton
should stop and a simple but effective
code for getting word to one another
that a meeting was imperative and
when and where they should meet in
such an event it was determined they
should not appear together publicly
payne was supposed to have left mex-
ico city like many other americans
until after the outcome of the pershing
pursuit of villa should be determined
and to have taken refuge in the nearest
large town to the border and there was
no reason to believe that any mexican
had ever suspected his connection with
the service nevertheless it was in line
with ordinary caution that they should
not be seen in company

  payne it was agreed should leave
dallas the next morning by one rail-
road line braxton by another they
thus would arrive in san antonio the
following evening on different trains
and at different stations

  with all these details settled the two
friends relaxed and conversation
drifted into more personal channels

  where have you been since i saw
you  asked payne at the first op-
portunity and ive been eaten up
with curiosity to know whether von
arnoldt really had that copy of the
note to japan whether you got it away
from him and what was in it

  ftve been to france running an er-
rand between the chief and stevenson

and i did get the papers but the lord
knows what was in them-i dont
briefly he sketched what had hap-
pened on the lampasas up to the time
von arnoldt threw his packet over-
board he touched as lightly as pos-
sible on the part played by miss lynde
when he had finished the story of the
germans capture he hesitated a sec-
ond then went on either his part-
ner had a copy or she had the original
and it was a copy he chucked into the
sea at any rate i had a bit of luck
her package got into my hands for a
couple of hours and williams took a
copy of it to the chief the night we
landed then i went to europe and
when i got back the chief was away-
and there you are id like pretty well
to know what was in that note myself
by the way are there many jap secret
men in san antonio

  rather less than there used to be a
few years ago the town was swarming
with them you remember every
town was that had an army post in it
they are more under cover now

  and the other nations anybody
there i know  it would be a good idea
to have it in mind who to look out
for

  theres one fine able representa-
tive of germany there-and doing well
i gather i was saving the news for a
bit of a surprise after you finished tell-
ing me your lampasas experience
guess

  braxton frowned germany you

dont mean that von arnoldt has-

  no not von arnoldt i fancy he
is safely lodged at the expense of the
british government sort of too bad
hes a fine upstanding nervy chap
no but thats a warm guess he
paused to make his information im-
pressive his beautiful blue-eyed
lady assistant

  esther lynde

  uh-huh the same as lovely as
ever and still busily engaged in making
a fourfold game



profitable friends i wonder if you
ever happened to run into henry cook
when your work has taken you to san
antonio

  cook cook i dont seem to place
him whats his business

  thats the point it says mexican
lands on the door of his office hes
a nice young chap good looking well
dressed owns a fast automobile trots
around with lots of girls-some that are
in- society and some that arent-always
has a smile for everybody always has
plenty of money in his pocket and dont
mind spending it well liked and pop-
ular with one and all makes his
money as i said before in mexican
lands only it happens i cant find
anybody-and ive looked into the mat-
ter quite carefully-who ever heard of
his selling any mexican lands or knows
exactly where they are located

  braxton waited inquiringly for the
conclusion

  something set me to looking him
up i guess it was the speediness with
which your little friend miss lynde
made his acquaintance after she arrived
a fortnight ago i made the department
quite a bit of trouble before i got
through but the result it seems to me
is fairly interesting mr henry cook
when he was born-in stuttgart-was
herr heinrich koch if it is allowable
to call an infant herr he has a gift
for languages his father is in the
german consular service young mr
cook i omitted to say claims when-
ever the matter of race and descent
comes up to have been born in new
york of swedish ancestors

  braxton pondered this a minute
and miss lynde he said you
say she is working with this cook
evidently theyre together a great
deal with the carsons in the back-
ground of course

  oh so theyre there too

  i fancy theyre always where miss
lynde is she strikes me as being a

person willing to risk almost anything
short of breaking the conventions and
im darned if i dont wish some of our
equally nice yankee girls would be as
careful as she is the continent has
it on us in some things

  what are they up to-miss lynde
and this cook have you any idea
not the slightest so far as ive
been able to find out they havent any-
thing to do with this sauceda game-
and thats the job im assigned to ger-
man activities is somebody elses hunt
whose

  havent the slightest idea i do
know theres somebody on it-at least
i suppose so from the chiefs letter of
instructions he said i need not bother
about germans or japs or any of the
other people just to stick to mexican
affairs in general and this sauceda job
in particular i havent run into any
of our people that i know except the
two or three fellows wdio are working
under me but of course that doesnt
prove anything ive been immolated
in mexico so long i hardly know any-
body in the service anyway unless
theyve happened to be sent there and
there are always chaps like yourself
that very few men even in the depart-
ment know

  where is miss lynde stopping
at the st francis this cook per-
son lives at the st francis too
happy coincidence-like the one when
she happened to get rooms at the presi-
dente on the next floor to von arnoldt
eh speaking of the presidente we
are sure now which of our interna-
tional friends got those papers-but
just who killed calderon

  i wish i knewt said waite

chapter xiv

buried dynamite

  pablo sauceda was unusually tall for
a mexican very deep of chest and
darker than the average mulatto with


the tpovuljlcr magazine

sharp glistening suspicious eyes and
a hard cruel mouth a man probably
of almost pure indian blood a fighter
of the villa type a much better edu-
cated man than villa however-it was
noticeable at first hearing that at some
time or other he had come under the
influence of mexicans who spoke cor-
rectly  very seldom indeed did he blur
his bs and vs

  he received braxton in the parlor
of the little cottage on san sebastian
avenue that served as his headquar-
ters there were two mexicans sitting
on the front gallery-doing nothing
there was a mexican sitting in a rock-
ing-chair under the fig tree that shaded
the side window of the room in which
sauceda sat-doing nothing voices
from a room in the rear indicated there
were also other mexicans within easy
call sauceda was well guarded also
the chance of eavesdroppers learning
what was discussed in that little parlor
was practically nil

  the house stood midway of the
block in a spot well shaded by trees
one who turned to enter it was quite
out of the glare of the arc lights that
hung at the street intersections it
stood in the middle of a good-sized lot
which gave it satisfactory isolation
while at the same time it was within
seven minutes street-car ride of the
very center of the city

  he greeted braxton in the center of
the room with a warm handclasp and a
smile that showed firm large very
white teeth and offered him a chair
he wasted no time in nonessentials

  in accordance with the request you
made of me when you called last eve-
ning senor i have made certain in-
quiries he said my friends inform
me that senor waite braxton is a rep-
resentative of the universal oil com-
pany they also described you ac-
curately enough to satisfy me you are
the man-although they do not mention

the beard which i presume is of re-
cent growth

  grown purely for the purpose of
this visit to the southwest put in
braxton

 yes so i have done what you
asked me to do i have found out who
you are yes that being the

case- he paused inquiringly

why why why he reiterated
impatiently as braxton did not speak
let us not be mysterious what does
senor braxton of the universal oil
company wish with me 

  ive come to sit into the game
said waite

 to what what game i do not
understand explain yourself

  you get me perfectly general im
here to watch the wheels go round
the mexican shrugged his shoulders
i do not understand what you mean
at all 

  pardon me general but if you will
consider a little i think it will come
to you it was hardly reasonable was
it that our good friend senor sted-
man would not want to keep track of
his shall we say-investment

  sauceda sat perfectly still for fully
a minute his black eyes on braxtons
face while waite withstood the
scrutiny smilingly then he shouted
andres to me a moment if you
please

  from the back room came the sound
of moving chairs and a cessation of
voices the door opened and a short
light-complexioned middle-aged man of
neat almost dandified appearance stood
on the threshold he was stylishly
dressed his graying mustache was care-
fully trimmed and his hair was parted
in a line that went over the top of his
head and down the back of it to his
neck being brushed on the back to both
sides he looked inquiringly from the
general to braxton and back

  andres said sauceda have you
ever met this gentleman before
a fourfoud game



  the new arrival entering and closing
the door smiled deprecatingly i fear
i have not had that honor he said

  i introduce you then to senor
waite braxton a representative of the
universal oil company you are quite
sure you have never happened to meet
him-in your travels

  the elderly man appraised waite
very sharply from head to foot he
spoke positively i think not i have
no recollection of it

  it is true i think you have never
seen me said braxton but i think
senor azcona-both sauceda and the
other looked more searchingly at him as
he pronounced the name-i think i
can convince you that i have seen you
quite recently to be exact a week
ago yesterday

  indeed said azcona it is pos-
sible  i was hereabouts at that time
no you were in new york i
arrived from there yesterday would
you like me to tell you where you were
in new york-and why the mex-
ican bowed

  you called twice wednesday at the
office of the universal oil company--
at noon and again at four on the fol-
lowing day-one week ago yesterday-
you were at the beekman house i
was not present at your interview with
senor stedman-it was without wit-
nesses as was entirely proper and nec-
essary-but you will believe i was not
far away when i mention that you left
your room after the interview-room
no -and came to the elevator with
him the hour you will recall was
five-thirty in the afternoon

  azcona flashed an inquiring glance
at his chief is that right andres
asked sauceda

  exactly

  thank you you may leave us
alone if you will-and thank you we
shall see considerable of senor brax-
ton i think he has come to-how

does he say it in the texas draw-poker
language-to sit into the game

  when azcona had shaken hands cere-
moniously with braxton and with-
drawn the general turned to the amer-
ican

  i see you are familiar with various
matters he remarked i suppose you
do not object to my writing senor sted-
man regarding you 

  not in the least braxton replied
grinning but if you have had any
experience with universal oil and the
methods of senor jeremiah stedman
you know perfectly will he will not
answer your letter senor stedman is
moderately careful to whom he writes
and what he says on paper however
write by all means if you wish he
will be angry that you put anything
about the matter in writing of course
but he is angry much of the time any-
way not the pleasantest man in the
world to get along with as you un-
doubtedly know yes he prefers con-
versations to letters and sends mes-
sengers instead of  messages-that is
why i am here but i cannot see why
you should not write him if you wish
you are not afraid of senor stedmans
bark you are not in his employ

  i am not afraid of any one i shall
write him declared sauceda judicially
and braxton felt sure - from his voice
that he would not

  you said suggested sauceda after
a moment that you had grown a beard
for the purpose of this visit it is your
hope then not to be identified

  i should prefer not to be it is not
to any ones interest that my new york
associates should be known in this
matter

  very true and your plan

  with your approval general i shall
be known hereabouts-except to your-
self and your principal friends-as one
of latin blood as you observe my
coloring is spanish and i have the lan-
guage


the popular magazine

  perfectly you must have lived
many years in-was it mexico

  spain it occurred to me while
remaining here on this visit that i
might be known by an assumed name
in fact i have already registered at the
hotel edgewood under the name of
correon-salvador correon i would
thus attract less attention among those
who assist you has the idea your ap-
proval 

  it is a very good one a brief
pause ensued what do you especially
plan to do  how do you desire to-to
sit into the game

  in any way that is helpful it is a
week since senor azcona left new
york perhaps you will be good
enough to tell me what progress has
been made in that time-

  the mexican replied readily enough
the work of recruiting goes on we
have gained more than two hundred
men in the week this makes the total
something over a thousand it will be
two thousand in a week five thousand
perhaps in a fortnight we can move
more rapidly now with more funds for
expenses

  recruiting for what waite wondered
he must continue blindly and what
number must be had before- he
left the question significantly open

  we hope for at least ten thousand
less than that would hardly suffice
besides we might as well continue to
recruit until the rifles and ammunition
are ready we have the money now
with which to buy them of course but
since this little incident at columbus
the american government has again put
an embargo on arms and cartridges
crossing the border it may be neces-
sary at the last to smuggle them across
and there is no sense in gathering ones
army and sending it over the river un-
til the tools with which to work are
there awaiting it

  so sauceda was talking about rais-
ing an army an army of texas mex-

icans to go across the rio grande and
fight for somebody for the cienti-
ficos it would naturally be presumed
bearing in mind the bias of the syndi-
cate as his father had expressed it
he felt quite certain sauceda was talk-
ing to him along the same lines that
azcona had pursued in talking with
jerry stedman

  you are scattering the enlistments
i suppose he said in various
towns

  oh yes not too many in any one
city or town-that would be to call
attention of the federal authorities
throughout south texas-here in san
antonio in barnes san pedro salado
counties in the counties along the rio
grande-all the way from brownsville
to del rio and up from the border a
hundred and fifty miles

  and they are all mexicans there
will be no american soldiers of for-
tune

  all mexicans every one of them
and we are raising them with the
promise of only small pay for the re-
lief of distressed mexico these
texas mexicans are intelligent com-
pared to the pelados below the border
they realize it is a terrible thing that
has come upon their kinsfolk at home
because of all these revolutions-this
condition of confusion and anarchy
we are appealing to their real patri-
otism

  and now beyond a doubt braxton
knew that sauceda was lying an army
he might be raising and very likely
was but he was flatly falsifying as to
the details hence presumably he was
also lying as to the purpose that how-
ever waite had suspected all the
while

  as regards the rifles and ammuni-
tion- braxton began with the idea

of leading the mexican to say more
none of which he was prepared to be-
lieve when there came an interruption

  a street car stopped at the near-by
a fdurfold game



corner and from it descended a mex-
ican who hurried at a walk that was
almost a run toward the middle of the
block where stood saucedas house as
he turned into the yard braxton heard
his -mpetuous footsteps followed then
his voice the voice of a mexican of the
pelado class he was calling from
some yards away to the twto men who
sat on guard on the front gallery

  ho friends he hailed i seek
the general quick i am jose lopez-
from mendon the dynamite that was
buried-

  a quick step on the gallery was fol-
lowed by a muffling of the words as
though some one had clapped an extin-
guishing hand over the speakers mouth
peace fool growled an ugly voice
cease shouting from the hills sit
and wait wait

  sauceda had lifted his head at the
interruption but braxton gave no sign
of having heard he had gone on with
his question asking where it was
planned to have the war supplies de-
livered and sauceda was on the point
of answering when there came a knock
on the front door to the generals in-
vitation to enter it opened and a very
wide-shouldered man with a broad nose
and a disfiguring scar across his dark-
hued forehead-a typical border bandit
-stood in the opening smiling a smile
that was more sinister than a scowl

  pardon my general he said but
you were to be reminded at nine oclock
that you had a long-distance telephone
call it is past nine his voice was
very soft but it was the same ugly
voice that had silenced the blunderer

  it is true i had forgotten thank
yon tomas sauceda rose and ex-
tended his hand i must ask you to
excuse me my friend he said to brax-
ton we shall see much of one an-
other i hope come at any time al-
ways you are welcome

  as waite passed through the door
and down the steps to the walk that led

straight to the street he noted that al-
though the murderous-looking tomas
had now stepped inside the house there
were still two men on the gallery-as
many as when he came one was sit-
ting as before in a chair the other
his back against a veranda post was
squatting on his heels this would be
jose lopez of mendon accustomed
to squatting before a jacal slow-
brained but excitable messenger he
made up his mind to cultivate jose at
a convenient moment

 mendon county seat of salado
county is less than fifty miles south
of san antonio one who is prepar-
ing to raise an army that shall cross
into mexico and be armed on that side
of the border has no cause to burv dv-

chapter xv

captains of ten

  braxton gained additional informa-
tion as to the errand of lopez when he
opened his newspaper the next morn-
ing carried inconspicuously on an in-
side page was this item under a men-
don date line

  manuel ruiz a mexican farm hand was
blown to bits by a mysterious explosion on
the farm of tom b ezell on the outskirts
of town yesterday afternoon ruiz was
plowing with a pair of mules and it is sup-
posed the plow struck a package of dynamite
or other similar explosive that happened to
be in the ground a short distance below the
surface other mexicans working not far
away heard the roar of the explosion and
found remains of the plow and the mules
the body of ruiz was annihilated

  mr ezell said last night he was at a loss
to explain the explosion as he had no dyna-
mite on his farm and had never known of
any being buried there the accident hap-
pened in a fenced lot not far from his house
where he decided to plow only yesterday
morning all the windows in his house were
broken and the shock of the explosion also
shattered several windows in town nearly a
mile away sheriff brown is conducting an
investigation - 


the popular magazine

  this supplied the details that lopez
undoubtedly had given sauceda after
braxton had gone but it shed no light
on the subject of why explosives in
large quantities had been buried in the
near outskirts of mendon braxton
considered as he ate his breakfast with
the newspaper propped up before him
the various possibilities of the incident
he determined to make a visit to men-
don as soon as should prove convenient

  he was eating lunch alone in the ho-
tel bonham that noon when two mex-
icans were ushered to the next table
this of itself was not a matter to at-
tract notice the bonham is a favorite
hotel with mexican refugees of the
better class braxton would not have
noticed them particularly had not a
scrap of their conversation come to him
one of them mentioned that somebody
-he did not catch the beginning of the
sentence-had brought it from new
york

  he noted then without appearing to
pay attention to the men that they were
both dark and of middle age one of
them was quite well dressed he looked
to be a city man the other while
clean enough and neat enough wore
obviously ready-made clothes of a cut
that had passed out of style some
months before his table manners
also indicated he was unused to the
ways of large hotels

  their voices were subdued only
fragments of the talk came to waites
ears he heard    moving fast
now   very soon perhaps next
week if    then how many
in your county and almost the entire
reply to that question twenty-eight
which means when each has summoned
his chain that three hundred and eight
will   

  they appeared soon after to have
changed the subject at any rate
nothing reached waites ears that
seemed to fit with what had gone be-
fore when he left the dining room

they were talking very little on any
subject having just been served and
the mexican with the ready-made
clothes being an extremely earnest
eater

  at nine that evening braxton called
again on sauceda at the san sebastian
avenue house the darkly smiling
tomas greeted him from the front gal-
lery and ushered him into the same
room in which he had met the former
villa general the night before this
time sauceda was not alone across
the oblong table in the center of the
room sat senor azcona-and the mex-
ican of the noontime conversation who
had said that his county possessed
twenty-eight which would be multi-
plied by eleven with the operation of a
chain sauceda presented this man
as senor escalera of somersworth

  the three talked with apparent free-
dom from which braxton felt sure he
had been the subject of careful dis-
cussion among the sauceda lieutenants
and that a definite policy of handling
him had been determined upon this
policy might be expected to work so
long as the only lieutenants he met were
the intelligent and resourceful ones and
waite felt an effort would probably
be made to prevent his coming in con-
tact with the others

  i am glad you happened to come at
just this minute said sauceda when
the introduction was out of the way
and waite and escaicra had murmured
their polite phrases of pleasure senor
escalera who came in to report his
progress down in san pedro county
had just asked me as to the number of
enlistments throughout south texas i
have no doubt you will be interested in
the answer

  he crossed the room to a small safe
and took from a locked compartment
a packet of papers as he spread them
before him on the table braxton saw
at a glance they were lists of names
grouped by counties and towns a
a fourfold game



county name being at the top of each
page

  sauceda began to run them over
putting down the total number of
names in each list bexar county
which contains san antonio led with
something over two hundred counties
near the river had from fifty to over
one hundred names each more north-
ern counties averaged twenty or twen-
ty-five except salado county which
had eighty-seven recruiting for the
cientifico cause would seem to be pop-
ular in and around mendon

  braxton did not doubt from their
appcarance that these wtere bona-fide
lists of recruits although he did doubt
very emphatically that the said recruits
had any intention of going across the
border to fight for the old order of
things that obtained before the down-
fall of diaz as sauceda went over
the sheets one by one and pushed them
to one side braxton had opportunity to
pick them up and glance casually
through them none of the lists con-
tained any name so far as he could
sec at a hurried glance with which he
was familiar except that page which
grouped the mendon recruits in the
salado county division on this he
saw the name of jose lopez that was
to be expected he looked quickly for
manuel ruiz the name of the an-
nihilated one was not there this also
was in accordance with his expecta-
tions  any mexican who had known
about the burying of the dynamite
would not have plowed into it

  when sauceda came to the san
pedro county list he looked up in-
quiringly nineteen he said and
you say you have-

  nine new names responded es-
calera producing a paper and handing
it across the table that makes twen-
ty-eight

  sauceda pinned the new list to the
old and went on with his count when

he had finished he added the figures
that he had put down by counties

  the total of all the lists was nearly
eleven hundred nearly eleven hun-
dred mexicans resident in texas
pledged to some undertaking to which
each stood to bring ten more-some un-
dertaking that might call for supplies
of dynamite and whose chaiacter must
be kept secret even from those who
were supplying the financial sinews at
least if those contributors happened to
be a certain new york syndicate it
was not far-fetched braxton thought
to presume the true purpose of the or-
ganization might be one that should be
kept a secret from all good americans

  eleven hundred-times eleven 
more than twelve thousand men a
fair-sized army and some reason for
keeping entirely dark the fact that these
listed recruits comprised less than a
tenth of the force that was being or-
ganized

  the count of the lists had taken more
than a half hour for some time after
that they conversed in a desultory man-
ner senor azcona finally looked at his
watch

  ten oclock he said i was
rather thinking of going down to the
madison club and getting a refreshing
drink-and perhaps after a little a
sandwich can any of you join me

  sauceda and escalera hastened to
say they had some personal matters to
discuss together that would prevent
their leaving braxton seeing in this
invitation a tactful way of getting him
out from under foot hastened to ac-
cept he and azcona bade the others
good night and boarded a street car
bound in town

  a members dance was in progress in
the ballroom of the madison club and
the seventh-floor dining room contained
many people braxton and his com-
panion found a small table at the side
of the room and ordered a light lunch
and innocuous drinks their conversa-


the popular magazine

tion was casual and general with no
reference to the greater matters in
which they were concerned azcona
was a smooth person polished and well
traveled he talked entertainingly but
there was an oiliness to his courtesy
that belied its sincerity

  a party of three or four young men
rose from a table near the front of the
dining room after a little and started
toward the elevators they were in
evening clothes obviously a part of the
dancing company three floors below
one of them caught sight of azcona
left his friends with a word of excuse
andcame toward their table he was a
man of thirty or thereabouts of excep-
tionally attractive appearance a man of
breeding apparently who had an air
of sophistication braxton as he ap-
proached noticed these things as well
as the up-to-the-minute cut of his
clothes and the tiny toothbrush mus-
tache above a mouth that smiled easily

  as he approached azcona said a
friend i will present you he rose
to shake hands with the pleasant-faced
newcomer and turned to waite who
also stood

  let me make you acquainted with
senor salvador correon he said in
spanish senor henry cook senor
cook is american he continued but
he speaks our tongue so much better
than i speak his that we usually con-
verse in it

  senor cook whom braxton at once
identified from paynes description as
that dilettante trader in mexican
lands whose birthplace-as heinrich
koch-was not new york and who
had a gift for languages greeted waite
with engaging cordiality

  senor azcona speaks flattery he
said in spanish almost as pure as brax-
tons own as a matter of fact his
own english is almost without accent
do you speak both languages senor

  oh yes assented waite

  i merely came over to pay my re-
spects cook added to azcona there
is a large crowd dancing to-night it
is a very pleasant party he ad-
dressed waite again you are a
stranger in san antonio senor 
waite said he had been in the city once
before and do you stay long

 who knows braxton smiled
shrugging with the quien sabe as a
mexican refugee might shrug at the
same question these are days of un-
certainty

 that is true well i am glad to
meet you and i trust we shall become
better acquainted good night the
young man again shook hands with
both in accordance with the demands
of mexican etiquette and strode
blithely away bowing to no less than a
half dozen acquaintances before he
reached the elevators

  a very pleasant gentleman sur-
mised braxton following cook with
his eyes is he connected in any way
with-mexican affairs

  only that he has business interests
in mexico-in coahuila i believe he
has many friends among the spanish-
speaking people among all people i
should say yes it would be fair to de-
scribe senor cook as an unusually pop-
ular young man

  he looks as if he might dance well
is he as attractive to the ladies as he is
to men

  senor azcona smiled and shook his
head slowly as the middle-aged may
do in discussing the attractiveness of
youth each day one sees him with
two or three on the street he said
and each night with one at some dance
or supper or in his car he is catholic
in his tastes-all beautiful women look
alike to him i fancy there have been
broken hearts he is a sad flirt but no
don tuan no one allows ones
daughters to be escorted by henry
cook and is it not pleasant to see
such courtesy on the part of an amer-
a foutrfolz game

lean  pardon me but you also have
it so my phrase was not unfortunate
too many americans are lacking in re-
spect toward other men yes senor
cook is a pleasant yroung gentleman
t take it since his business inter-
ests are in mexico-and business in-
terests in mexico are not paying many
dividends just now-that he is a man
of some means

  undoubtedly although as to that i
have no knowledge

  after a little azcona glanced at his
watch i had no idea it was getting
so late he exclaimed it is past my
usual bedtime

  chatting they went down in the ele-
vator at the ballroom floor the car
filled it was midnight and the dance
was breaking up down on the ground
floor a dozen or twenty men and
women were standing in the reception
hall and the wide ladies parlor wait-
ing for friends or for motors to arrive
over the heads of a group of chatter-
ing girls as he moved from the ele-
vator toward the outer door he saw
esther lynde standing apart from any
group she was looking directly at
him and he thought he saw a flash of
recognition pass over her face he
turned his head away quickly and
passed through the outer door talking
steadily and without much under-
standing of what he was saynng to az-
cona he did not look again in her di-
rection  therefore he did not see the
smiling mr cook step to her side a
second after he had turned his head
bringing her cloak

  it annoyed him exceedingly that he
should feel so confused and school-
boyish at the meeting what did he
care for one who had regarded him as
merely a convenient tool to be used in
the game she played he said good
night at the foot of the steps to senor
azcona and set out to walk to his ho-
tel a tool yet she was very beau-
tiful and very sweet why couldnt
b p

she have kept away from san an-
tonio 

  as her eyes fell upon his face-she
could not believe he had seen her else
why should he have looked away-she
exclaimed why there is wtaite
braxton

  i beg pardon said mr cook ar-
riving at that second braxton  who
is braxton  i dont believe i know
him

  that very dark distinguished-iook-
ing man just passing through the door
-with senor azcona he is waite
braxton of new york-i imagine you
have heard of him braxton of the
universal oil

 mr cook smiled he may be
waite braxton of the universal oil
he said but a half hour ago when i
was in the dining room and was in-
troduced to him he was salvador cor-
reon of somewhere in mexico per-
haps there is a striking resemblance
correon she said she adjusted
her wrap and made ready to move to-
ward the door yes she said a
very striking resemblance indeed
they could quite easily pass for twin
brothers it quite deceived me for a
moment

chapter xvi

a mad program

  waite was up betimes the next
morning and into the edge wood dining
room not long after it opened seated
at a table some distance away his back
toward braxton was a figure that
looked somehow familiar waite
studied it furtively after a few mo-
ments the man turned his head to make
some request of the waiter and dis-
played a regular stern profile of wind-
bitten weather-tanned skin and sin-
gularly steady cold eyes recognition
came quickly enough to braxton and
he shifted his position so as to turn his
back to the other when last he had
seen that leathery face and those steady


the popular magazine

eyes the man had worn khaki riding
clothes and a high peaked hat and
there had been pistols in the holsters on
both hips in ordinary street clothes
as he was now he looked somehow
smaller and less competent but there
was no mistaking him he was cap-
tain robert dalton of the texas
rangers

  something over three years before
dalton and braxton had met on the
mexican border and been thrown to-
gether more or less for a fortnight
waite had been of some small service
to the ranger and dalton had also
helped him in the task on which he was
engaged and they had forgathered so-
cially a bit-had smoked and talked eve-
nings gone shooting quail one day and
once visited together the masonic lodge
in the little town in which they had
their business

  the first impulse on braxtons part
had been to cross the dining room and
renew the acquaintance but dalton did
not know him as a government agent
and how could he explain his registra-
tion at the hotel under an assumed
name  he hurried his grapefruit
drank a cup of coffee and left the
dining room while the ranger was still
at the table

  at a lunch bar downtown he ate a
real breakfast and before nine oclock
was on a side street entering a large
garage whose sign proclaimed that it
was conducted by blossom  reed
auto livery he had once seen mr
blossom and heard that gentleman
talk unless he had erred in sizing up
the man he felt he was just the person
for the undertaking at hand he
wanted a good trustworthy chauffeur
and he wanted to be positive the man
could not understand spanish

  mr blossom as waite had noted
through the window before entering
was already on duty in the office of the
garage he was a medium-sized
gangling fellow with a roving adams

apple and china-blue eyes whose age
might be anywhere from twenty-five to
forty no well-traveled person could
have possibly mistaken his dialect
which was down-east yankee as a
matter of fact amos p blossom was
born in kittery maine where his fa-
ther worked in the navy yard and
learned the machinist trade at saco a
trip to texas as chauffeur for a con-
sumptive millionaire and a shrewd ap-
preciation of the possibilities of the
tourist trade had anchored him in san
antonio with a partner from back home
and a flourishing business

  braxton addressed him  in rapid
spanish i want to hire a good car
and a driver for the day to make a trip
out into the country

  mr blossom smiled - deprecatingly
sorry he said in english but i
dont speak spanish-not any at all
waite shrugged his shoulders as
though he also were handicapped by
ignorance- and again spoke in spanish
this time very very slowly

  i wish to hire a car and a driver
he said and i think you would like the
job because it will be worth quite a
little money to you

  this if blossom could understand
spanish at all ought to produce an
acknowledgment of the fact unless
braxton had made an error in judg-
ment the liveryman probably still had
the first dollar he had ever earned hid-
den in the darkest closet in his house
with a railroad spike on it to keep it
from flying away a job that would
mean quite a little money would be
open to discussion at any rate but
blossom shook his head and raised his
voice as though his prospective patron
were deaf

 me-no-spik spanish  he de-
clared i get that word dinero but
not another darned thing you said
all right replied braxton in his
native tongue well speak english
then what would you charge for a
a fourfolcd game



car to be gone all day-to-day-to
start right now you to drive it your-
self

  gosh mister you surprise me
honest you do declared blossom i
thought you couldnt speak english al
all say if it aint too much to ask
why didnt you talk english when i
first said i couldnt talk spanish

i dont know it didnt occur to me
i guess i think in spanish you see
uh-huh well i dont drive my
cars much myself but i got a lot of
good chauffeurs i can let you have

  i want you personally

  blossoms china eyes searched brax-
tons black ones where was you
thinkin of goin

  mendon down in salado county
perhaps four or five miles beyond
there

 how many passengers them
roads dowrn mendon way are certainly
awful hard on the springs and tires
just myself

  forty dollars

  forty dollars oh i say thirty
is about the usual--

  yeah but this aint no usual trip
if you want one of my good cars mis-
ter and youre especially fussy about
gettin a chauffeur that aint goin to
understand what you say if you stop
and talk to somebody in spanish why
the way i figure it its wuth a little
more sometimes once in a while ive
noticed theres a leetle risk goes with
these trips on mexican business you
see i talk frankly man fashion be-
tween you and i i aint specially stuck
on these jobs ive had one or two ex-
periences as you might say

  what makes you think i dont want
a spanish-speaking chauffeur

 mebbe its just my mind you
think in spanish i think in yankee
get me

  i do laughed braxton amused
and at forty i expect to hire a good

car a competent chauffeur-yourself
and a close mouth

  mister said blossom earnestly i
aint never one of that talkin kind
you can believe me or not but the last
time i took out a mexican part one
of the gentlemen tried to rob me-with
a pistol too-and i never even told the
police

  did he succeed in doing it

  well no to tell you the honest
truth he didnt but golly it was
mighty unpleasant i try to keep out of
unpleasant jobs-unless they pay fairly
well i aint no rough character and
up where i come from they dont be-
lieve in shootin and all that

  mr blossom youre hired de-
clared braxton blamed if i dont be-
lieve you would keep your mouth shut
even if you did speak spanish and
i have  feeling your company to-day
is going to be worth the extra money
well be ready to start in fifteen
minutes said blossom jest as soon
as i look over the gas and the tires
he turned away with a sigh hon-
est he said the way the roads are
down in that mendon country and the
price of tires and gasoline the way it
is now i ought to charge you more
i wont make hardly a cent

  they had to pass through a part of
the citys center before striking into the
road that led southward toward salado
county two or three blocks from
the garage they met a handsome low
black car with two occupants and
braxton was glad he had already
donned the dust coat and goggles he
had borrowed from blossom the two
occupants were general sauceda late
of the forces of pancho villa and
henry cook san antonio agent for
mexican lands

  once clear of the city blossom set-
tled down to a gait that combined mod-
erate speed wtith comfort plus a proper
solicitude for springs and tires it was
a beautiful spring day-one of those

south texas april days when the mer-
cury reaches eighty degrees in the
shade but an ample breeze prevents
the heat from being noticeable so long
as one remains in the shade with the
top up motoring was very comfortable
the car rolled steadily on over fair
roads through wide areas of mesquite
and pear cactus then across prairies
where the texas bluebonnet as far in
every direction as the eye could see
tinted the ground a brighter cerulean
than the sky

  they passed without stopping through
little villages that all looked alike-a
principal street with three or four
stores a few dozen one-story frame
houses with perhaps an adobe building
or two a couple of corrals-and then on
into the open country again darting
lizards scuttled for shelter in the sand
beside the road ground squirrels and
horned toads hurried ahead of them as
though bound somewhere on sudden
and important business jack rabbits
and cottontails scampered away at their
approach and once on a rise not a
hundred yards away a pair of coyotes
stood and eyed them curiously

  they did not talk much once after
a longer silence than usual blossom
said

  say mister of course it aint none
of my business and i aint tryin to butt
in or nothin but you aint happened to
mention to me what your name was 

  havent i said waite absent-
mindedly there was a pause

  i getcher remarked blossom
quite without rancor

  early in the afternoon they reached
mendon a pretentious town of six or
seven thousand inhabitants possessing
an ornamental railroad station several
brick blocks a cotton gin two well-
advertised real-estate additions and a
prosperous-looking little bank along
the main street saddle horses stood
drowsily anchored in their places by
psychology-the reins being dropped

over their heads to drag on the ground
at their feet a procedure which usually
convinces a south texas horse that he
is irrevocably hitched 	

  braxton and blossom ate substan-
tially at a short-order restaurant
across the street from the bank after
which waite by a few tactful inquiries
at the post office located jose lopez
as being a sort of head man among the
mexicans employed on the farm of one
martin on the southern outskirts of the
town the martin farm he heard ad-
joined the property of ezell where the
explosion had taken place he also
learned to his satisfaction that if he
was desirous of finding bill martin he
had come on a bad day bill having but
that morning taken the train for san-
tone

  they came upon lopez working
with six or seven other mexicans in a
field bordered by the road and brax-
ton summoned him to come to the car
he removed his hat as he approached
a dark-brown soft-eyed pock-marked
man of fifty of the peon type a scar
across one cheek and two fingers
missing from his left hand bore mute
witness that in his day he had been
concerned in knife fights this was a
man who would probably be faithful to
his associates in any conspiracy but
not one of much intelligence and with
no especial ability to think quickly in
any emergency save a purely physical
one the course to pursue with him
was to overwhelm him with authority
trusting to his natural awe of caste to
overcome his caution

  put cm your hat jose the sun is
hot commanded braxton in rapid
spanish with the air of one who kindly
condescends the driver of the car
has no spanish at all therefore you
can talk freely has sheriff brown
learned anything yet about the dyna-
mite 

 the dynamite sheriff brown
what should i- jose stammered
a fourfoud game



swung off his feet by the suddenness of
the question

  it is all right perhaps you have
forgotten me-perhaps you never no-
ticed me-at san sebastian avenue i
have seen you you are one of us
the general i may say speaks quite
highly of you-although tomas
thought you shouted too loud when you
came in night before last with the
news

  a look of relief passed over lopezs
face this stranger knew of that visit
and must therefore be trustworthy

  pardon my hesitation one must be
careful he murmured what did you
ask about the sheriff no he rat-
tles around like corn in the tortilla
stone before it is ground there is none
of the band who will tell perhaps
some might wish to do so for money

but if they did- he showed his

teeth in a smile that was entirely pleas-
ant and made a motion with his right
forefinger as though cutting his own
throat no he said they will
not tell

  and you have your ten

 yes five of these are among
them he waved his hand to indicate
the other laborers in the field who
were making only a pretense of work
and staring at joses aristocratic visitor
here are six but one has a negro
wife and negroes will often tell the
gringos what is afoot so he has not
been included

  and you know your share of the
work-when the time comes  brax-
ton was groping blindly but hopefully

  oh yes senor i and my ten are
to attend to the dynamite the new
supply has partly come in and there
will be more to-morrow have no
fear he said it proudly we shall
have it at the bank just on time one
hour after the telegraph message
comes

 and who takes it then

  who but mendoza  there has been
no change in that has there

  no i only ask to make sure you
have not forgotten and what shall
you and yours do then

  when the bank blows up we loot
his tongue licked his lips we loot
the money and leave the papers and a
one-hundredth of what we get shall be
divided among the twenty-two-me and
my ten and mendoza and his ten and
the rest we shall take to the south when
we go away after the town isburning
braxton did not dare to sk who was
to set the fires how could they hope
to accomplish so desperate a scheme in
a town as large as mendon  he fished
sharply for more information

  and the sheriff and his deputies 
can there be any mistake about them
there must be no hitch there

  no senor trustworthy men have
that in charge when the bank goes up
-boom -they and the city marshal
will come running from their houses
and our men will kill them very care-
fully at once of course he said
naively some of us must expect to be
killed also these gringos are good
shots but most of them will be too
busy they will start to come in town
when the bank goes up and then they
will turn back again as their own houses
begin to burn between these times
our people will have much time to loot
and the horses for the escape will all
be stolen of course during the hour
before as has been planned

  waite feared to go into the matter
too far and feared as greatly that he
might miss some important admission
you are sure they cannot telephone
ahead to have you arrested in the towns
to the south he asked

  but how asked the mexican
when all the wires have been cut as
is provided  and will not every other
town to the south be having its own
matters to attend to  he paused a
second and a look that might be either


the popular magazine

suspicion or fear came into his eye i
do not understand senor you are one
of them-at san sebastian avenue
how comes it that you must ask these
questions 

  to make sure you know the an-
swers was the quick and stem reply
we take no chance of blunders being
made by thick-skulled hombres and
so one more question  what provision
is made as regards the soldiers

  are they not far down on the bor-
der-and few  and will not pancho
villa or the brave luis de la rosa come
across the rio grande and attend to
them but the gringo soldiers will run
anyway and the government will not
let them fight it is afraid of mexico
now as to the texas rangers that is
different may the saints protect me
from meeting texas rangers 

  you did not get exactly what i
meant said braxton i meant not
the soldiers along the border but those
back in san antonio at fort sam
houston let me hear what you are
to do if they pursue you so i may know
you have the lesson well learned

  souls of the saints senor are you
making fun of me how will the sol-
diers at san antonio hear of what is
happening in south texas with all the
wires cut and if they did what of
it will they not be busy enough in
san antonio itself with the banks
blowing up the city afire in so many
places and all the bridges dynamited
good lord ejaculated braxton
under his breath it is well jose i
shall report that you for one are
surely to be depended upon so now
i shall go on i have other captains
of ten to see and other towns to visit
good day jose

  to blossom he said in english
well be moving on and when
they had passed beyond the hearing of
lopez go through the town easy
so as not to attract attention and when
you get out in the country hit her up

for san antonio as fast as you can
burn up the road damn the price of
tires and gasoline the job will be
worth fifty dollars for the day if you
make it in three hours

  theyre mad absolutely mad he
muttered to himself as blossom with-
out comment gave indications that he
purposed to earn the extra money
but before the fools find outthat they
are fools how many men they can kill
and how many women- say blos-
som  he said aloud if you get there
in two hours and a half ill make it
sixty

chapter xvii

an invaluable aily

  twilight had fallen but it was not
yet entirely dark when they rocketed
over the brow of a hill and swept down
its farther slope toward the citys lights
waite espied ahead under the nearest
arc lamp an isolated building brightly
illuminated which from noting it in
the morning he remembered as bear-
ing the sign steves last chance
saloon

  stop at the barroom he said to
blossom i want to use the tele-
phone

  all right agreed the chauffeur be-
ginning to slow down but i got ten
minutes yet to make the center of town
in two hours and a half and i can do
it if you go to stoppin to telephone
seems as if you ought to take out the
time it takes or make some such al-
lowance dont it

 youve earned the sixty and
maybe when i get through talking ill
want you to stick on the job some time
longer-hours perhaps you can do
it i suppose

  sure thing i aint one of those
fellers that dont appreciate getting a
good customer take your time

  the telephone in steves last chance
was a wall instrument with no provi-

sion for privacy but the plans braxton
had laid with payne for calling him in
time for emergency provided for such
a contingency therefore it was a per-
fectly innocent message that would
have been overheard if any one curi-
ously listened when he and payne
who fortunately happened to be in his
hotel room had finished a brief ex-
change of commonplace remarks they
had in reality made an appointment for
a meeting an hour later at a definite
place

  you can take it easy from now into
town said braxton as he climbed
back into the seat beside blossom
weve got to be out near hot wells
an hour from now in the meantime
if you know some short-order place be-
tween here and there well stop off and
get a bite to eat theres a chance ill
want to use you pretty late

  an hour later a hot wells trolley
car stopped at a dark corner two miles
from town and leroy payne alighted
as the car went on he waited to let
his eyes get used to the darkness and
then walked confidently toward an auto-
mobile that stood beside the road a
hundred feet away

  here we are called braxton in
spanish as he approached get in
well ride slowly and talk as we go
speak spanish entirely the chauffeur
doesnt understand it

  he instructed blossom to drive
leisurely-anywhere-and the livery-
man picked out the direction that would
be least hard on the tires and kicked in
his clutch sitting with payne in the
tonneau braxton went over as rapidly
as was consistent with clarity the star-
tling results of his days fishing expedi-
tion

  and there it is ab-so-lutely
crazy and yet undoubtedly true and
as near as i can make out they plan
to pull the thing off within a few days
wsve got to stop it

  it sounds too insane to be possible

exclaimed payne if i didnt know
you id be tempted to turn back to
the large and ornate group of buildings
on the left which we passed about five
minutes ago and which is the south-
western asylum and have you exam-
ined as it is- whew its some

contract to head off a scheme in two or
three days that has eleven thousand
men in it and includes the wrecking
of all the towns in south texas

  ive been turning it over in my mind
ever since we left mendon weve got
to get the men at the top-the men that
are going to send out the telegraph sig-
nal if the signal doesnt go out the
uprising falls flat

  that means we must gather in sau-
ceda and all his first lieutenants and
weve got to get that list of recruits you
saw at saucedas house-those captains
of ten we wont be safe until the
sheriff of every south texas county is
rounding them up and putting them
where they cant set off their powder
mines

  but first we have to learn exactly
what the plot is what for instance
are they planning to start here in san
antonio when the banks begin to
blow up and the city is afire in so many
places and the bridges are dynamited
lopez said an uprising like that in a
city of a hundred and twenty-five thou-
sand people with efficient police and
sheriffs department would last about
two hours i figure but think what
harm could be done in one hour-or a
half hour for that matter

  weve got to get hold of one of the
ringleaders and third-degree a con-
fession out of him can we do it

  i dont believe theres a man in the
crowd but would face it out we could
threaten him but he wouldnt believe
it these mexicans dont believe any
yankee means what he promises any-
way

  its a pity we arent working with
some texas rangers a greaser is


the tpopular magazine

more afraid of those sixty or seventy
rangers down on the border than he
is of the whole united states army

  by jove ive got it cried brax-
ton and in english he spoke to the
chauffeur turn around and drive
like blazes for the edgewood hotel

  now what form has your mania
taken demanded payne

  what a chump i was not to think of
it captain bob dalton of the rangers
-do you know him 

  ive never seen him but of course
ive heard of him some man they
say

  hes at the edgewood or at least he
was there at breakfast time this morn-
ing if we can get him-and ive
thought of the other end of the com-
bination too the man that is  to be
made to squeal azcona 

  i dont know but youre right

  i feel sure of it hes not so young 
as he used to be and hes a fop i dont
believe but what hes a physical coward
and hes away inside on this thing
knows every detail of it yes sir
hes the man

  its worth trying at any rate but
first find your captain bob

  they drew up before the edgewood
a quiet hotel with a family patronage
some little distance from the center of
town wait for us braxton com-
manded the chauffeur come on le-
roy if hes in the hotel lets not lose
a minute

  captain dalton to their great relief
was in the hotel and had gone to his
room a rangers life outside the cities
having a tendency to give him the early-
to-bed-and-early-to-rise habit waite
wrote two or three lines on a card
signed his real name and his alias to it
and sent it up word came promptly
back that captain dalton would like to
see mr correon and his friend in his
room

  dalton had not gone to bed and was
waiting to greet them in the door

dressed except for his coat when the
boy who showed them up had vanished
around the corner of the hall he closed
the door shook hands with them and
motioned them to seats

  im certainly right glad to see you
again he said to braxton let me
see it must be moren three years
since we went to see the third that
night down in mawnin star lodge
payne happens to be one too said
waite but we havent got any time to
talk about lodges much as i like to most
always see here captain ive al-
ways been told a texas ranger can be
absolutely depended upon not to tell
anything he runs onto in the course of
his work-anything that is nobody
elses business i mean

  he gets so into the habit some-
times drawled dalton that he dont
talk about even the things it wouldnt
do any harm to spill if you mean can
i keep a secret-i can

  there arent a dozen men in the
united states know this one said
braxton earnestly i am an agent of
the united states secret service so is
mr payne  he has been located in mex-
ico city a number of years it is as
important his identity should not be
known as my own

  daltons eyes went from face to face
of course that explains now why
you-all beat it out of the diriin room
without sayin howdy this mawnin
he remarked

  i didnt think you saw me

  i lowed you didnt want me to
when you hitched your chair around
but im right glad to get the explana-
tion when i asked the girl and found
out you was travelin under a greaser
name i didnt know what to think
about it i gather this call is on some
matter of business what can i do for
you 

  one of the most important things a
ranger captain ever had a chance to do
for the people of texas
y fourfol game



  thats quite a statement all right
im goin to try to do it shoot

  braxton put the captain in possession
of the story dalton listened intently
without interrupting his face hard-
ened perceptibly when the tale reached
the point where lopez outlined the
mendon program

  another fplan of san diego  he
commented as waite paused

  i heard something about that but
there wasnt much about it in the
northern papers said braxton it
was nearly a year ago wasnt it
started in july last year the
scheme was to organize an uprising
among the texas mexicans seize
ranches and little towns along the bor-
der and a hundred miles north of it
bring across an army of bandits under
a yellow-toothed hound named perez
and annex the south half of texas ari-
zona new mexico and california to
mexico thats all a villa scheme
this sounds like another since that
bad hombregot petted andtold he was
a human bein by a few trusting white
men hes thought he was another na-
poleon

  were you on the border during the
plan of san diego

  i was and a nasty mess they made
for us for a while one of my men
got perez in a fight one night that
put a stop to it in my section-that and
various other things that happened to
the mexicans that were mixed up in it
braxton resumed and repeated what
lopez had said about the plan to ter-
rorize even san antonio itself dalton
smiled grimly

  what a proud chance theyd have
to get away with that he exclaimed
weve been lookin for em to think up
something of the sort for a year-and
fixin to take care of it theres
enough guns and ammunition over in
the courthouse right this minute-and
men sleepin handy-to put down a riot
within half an hour after it got started

only after that it would be a hell of a
bad time in santone for five or ten
thousand mexicans

  his face set harshly if it wasnt
for the twenty or thirty or fifty folks
the greasers would kill before they be-
gan to pay the reckonin id almost feel
like lettin em start it it would be a
lesson that would do every hombre in
south texas good i dont know but
id feel like lettin em start it even
though they did kill a few good men-
if it wasnt for the women how-
ever- of course we aint going to

and weve got to bust this scheme so
far as the little towns to the south of
us go some of those towns have ten
mexicans to one white man all right
what do you want me to do

  braxton and payne outlined to him
their idea as to the possible vulnerabil-
ity of azcona if the right kind of
pressure were applied captain dalton
agreed their idea was a good one

  you fellows want to be present
-when i dig down into his soul he
asked

  i do said waite it would prob-
ably be just as well if payne werent
they dont know him at all and i
dont want to appear as anybody but
braxton of universal oil azcona
knows me that way i was thinking
perhaps you could arrest me too
that aint such a bad idea see
here you go find azcona start some-
where with him-anywhere away from
the refugee bunch ill hunt up one of
my boys-there are two of em around
town somewhere and i ought to be able
to find one in less than an hour-and
take you both in where will you be
with him

  hes usually out to saucedas house
at this hour suppose i find him there
and get him to walle across toward the
madison club ill ask him to have
lunch with me you could be on ryder
street along there by the bridge
good business and you the


the popular magazine

captain all energy and resourcefulness
turned to payne what was you plan-
nin to do

  i thought id be gathering my men
-ive got three in the city-and put
them to watching the san sebastian
joint and getting ready to make the
pinch of the crowd when we get to it
i cant personally make the raid you
know it would give me away and
make me useless in the future

 you can count me and my boys in
on that too of course i suppose it
will be too late when we get through
with azcona to start anything out there
to-night 

  wed better wait until to-morrow
put in braxton it is my idea to catch
all the lieutenants together and all
those that are in town usually show up
at saucedas between eight and ten

  captain dalton stood up and began
strapping on a belt that lay on his
bureau a belt containing many vicious-
looking -caliber cartridges and two
holsters one hanging low on the right
anti the other high on the left two
long revolvers lay on the bureau be-
side it he thrust them into the holsters
and reached for his coat

  get your greaser and come down by
the back of the madison chib he said
sharply and put up your hands quick
when i mention it along by the river
we wont hurt you of course but when
i make a bluff i like to make a good
one temporarily youll be a prisoner
and ill treat you as such maybe the
play will lay so you can help me prod
this azconas memory better in that
capacity than in any other

  he looked around the room adjusted
the hang of his belt and hitched the
right-hand holster a little farther for-
ward

  well he pronounced i reckon
were all set lets go

  esther lynde and henry cook had
dined at the madison club that night

and taken a cool ride afterward in
cooks fast car accompanied by mrs
carson mr carson was awaiting them
on their arrival at the st francis a
little before ten and the four sat for a
few minutes on the long outdoor log-
gia of the hotel then the carsons
went to their room and esther and the
popular land agent remained on the
veranda

  they talked a long time in voices
that did not carry to other ears finally
they sat alone the girl looking at her
watch and exclaiming at the lateness
of the hour rose to enter the hotel

  so she said-she was speaking in
german-it will be quite soon

  within less than a week and then
-our good washington friends will
have something else to do with their
ammunition besides sending it to eu-
rope

  i wonder if they really will inter-
vene she said half to herself

  can even washington do anything
else

  in her room miss lynde opened a
trunk and took out all the trays she
pressed a spring and a section of the
bottom of the trunk opened disclosing
a small volume printed on sheet of the
thinnest india paper

  for an hour thenshe sat at the writ-
ing desk laboriously transcribing a
message by the aid of the book when
it was finished it contained a seemingly
meaningless jumble of words

  she wrote at the top a name and ad-
dress in washington on a street oc-
cupied entirely by private residences
then she looked in her purse to be cer-
tain she had enough money with which
to prepay the message shook her head
as she consulted her watch and realized
mr carson was long since in the land
of dreams-and telephoned for a taxi-
cab when it came she ordered the
driver to take her to a telegraph office
it was but four blocks distant but the
hour was after one

azcona shows his teeth

  the chauffeur threw on the self-
starter as braxton and his two com-
panions came out of the edgewood
waite climbed in beside him and the
others entered the tonneau

  mr blossom said braxton this
is captain dalton of the rangers

  the automobile man turned to shake
hands cordially by golly im sure
glad to make your acquaintance capn
he said ive ben hearin of you off
and on ever since i come to texas
you can drive up to san sebastian
avenue said braxton and let me off
somewhere along the  block ill
walk from there he added to the
others then i want you to take cap-
tain dalton wherever he wants to go
youre under his orders until further
notice by and by perhaps there will
be a little excitement of one sort or
another perhaps youll see me getting

arrested that will-

  say mister i aint going to get in
any trouble-any fightin or anything
of that sort am i  im a pretty peace-
able feller you know and i-

  no it will be captain dalton that
will be arresting me i dont expect to
put up any fight

  cap dalton oh i see i swear
but this is gettin to be an excitin town
to live in when i first come down
here i thought it was goin to be wild
and woolly and it want and now ive
got used to its bein quiet and peaceable
and-

  sure thats the way life is-one
surprising thing after another and
youre getting paid among other things
to forget what happens you remember
youre under captain daltons orders
after you leave me do just what he
says dont ask me for any instruc-
tions or even act as if you had ever
seen me

  i getcher i guess its all right or

there wouldnt be a ranger in it would

there ive heard that-

  and now well start for san se-
bastian avenue-pronto

  the task at the sauceda house was
absurdly easy azcona was there with
one or two others and braxton said he
had nothing in particular on his mind
except to ask what progress was being
made in the recruiting sauceda gave
him the information and they sat and
smoked talking of various unimportant
things until the hour was nearly up
then waite proposed to azcona that
they walk to the madison club a dis-
tance of not mcrfe than a half mile and
azcona accepted cheerfully so they
came sauntering through ryder street
two blocks back of the madison club
toward where an automobile stood in
the shadow

  as they came under the illumination
of a street light a block away two men
who had been standing near the auto-
mobile started walking to meet them
the pair separated as they neared
braxton and the mexican so that it
was necessary to go between them or
step out into the middle of the street

  then as the two pairs came close to
each other azcona found himself sud-
denly seized in an iron grip a pistol
waved menacingly from him to brax-
ton and a curt voice not loud but em-
phatic commanded

  put up your hands both of you
quick  and nof a sound youre un-
der arrest

  braxton threw his hands above his
head instantly the man whoheld the
revolver and who was on his side
looked in the darkness to be steady and
competent and as the long barrel of
the colt waved from him to azcona
waite recalled that a texas gunman
always has his finger pressed on the
trigger as he draws his pistol and holds
it from being discharged only by the
pressure of his thumb on the hammer


the popular magazine

he hoped this young ranger had a
strong thumb	x

  captain dalton had seized azconas
right wrist at the moment he gave the
order and a fraction of a second later
he had twisted the man around
searched him and taken an automatic
pistol from under his arm and a nasty-
rlooking knife from the back of his neck
the struggle prevented the mexican
from calling out but as he realized he
was disarmed he found his voice

  who are you  he demanded this
is some mistake i have done nothing
ranger service replied dalton
briefly and no mistke you are
andres azcona and this other hombre
is salvador correon alias braxton
get in

  he pushed azcona toward the auto
you first carl he ordered the young
ranger well let mr azcona sit be-
tween us you-to braxton-get
into the front seat beside the driver
and remember theres a pistol pointing
at you from in back and if you start
to make any get-away itll go off and
i usually hit what i aim at

   a second later blossom evidently in
pursuance of instructions previously re-
ceived started the car and went spin-
ning northward

  look here ranger exclaimed az-
cona after a moment youre not
heading toward the police station

   i reckon youre right replied the
captain

  where are we going

   taking a little ride

   but-ive got rights under the law
i demand to be taken at once to the
police station and allowed to offer bail
i demand to see your warrant those
are my legal rights

  maybe said the captain maybe
but we aint going to the police station
quite yet we aint going to give any
mexicans hanging around city hall a
chance to run and tell your pals youre

pinched and as regards the warrant
--all in due time

  but i demand- his voice rose

oh

  ill twist it harder the next time you
start telling me what you demand and
if you dont lower your voice ill gag
you

  the car its occupants now all silent
spun out through the suburbs and into
the north loop road two or three
miles along that highway they rolled
and then on the top of a rise came to
a prosperous farm of two or three hun-
dred acres with well-kept grounds in
front of a handsome rambling house
the car turned in through ornamental
gateways

  the ridge hill farm said captain
dalton to nobody in particular for
braxtons benefit belongs to my
brother his wife happens to be away
so he didnt mind if we made his garage
our headquarters for the evening nice
little farm hes got nearest house is
more than half a mile away

  azcona straining his brain for the
best method of handling the situation
essayed a weak jest fine place for
a murder he remarked cuttingly

  youve said something replied
dalton in so cold a voice that the mex-
ican shuddered

  a lamp was lighted in the house and
a man a few years older than the cap-
tain-somewhere in the late forties-
came out on the gallery

  that you bob  he called got
em 

  yep is the garage all ready
theyre a pair of bad hombres

  their host led the way to a good-
sized frame building and lighted a
large hanging lamp he stood back
then and surveyed the prisoners who
were being led in he was coatless and
had provided against contingencies by
strapping on his own holstered 

the garage had been built to accom-
modate three automobiles and but one
a fourfold game



car was in it so there was plenty of
room dalton placed two chairs several
feet apart you sit there he ordered
braxton roughly you there to az-
cona now ill talk to you first

  ranger carl took up a position be-
hind azconas chair dalton removed
his coat and stood before the mexi-
can

  we wont waste any time in pre-
liminaries the captain said youre
going to tell me about this scheme you
hombres are trying to put over come
on

  azcona was silent

 come on growled the ranger
more insistently

  i demand to see your warrant and
to be taken to the police station and
to have an attorney and i demand

  smack dalton slapped azconas
face not a very hard slap not a blow
that could possibly injure him a slap
that swung from the elbow only and
contained none of the strength that
the captains rippling shoulder muscles
could have given it

 come on and come clean ly-
ing wont do

  azcona at the blow tried to leap to
his feet but ranger carl behind him
pushed him down by the shoulders
the mexican looked from left to right
at braxton and at the hostile faces of
the two daltons he wet his lips
this is cowardly he cried three
to two and all of you armed i have

always heard the rangers-

  dalton threw his right hand out from
his side im going to hit you again
he warned

  i give you my word it is an inno-
cent thing azcona hastened to say
merely some refugees forming a club
to-

 smack the blow was no harder
than before this aint no torture
chamber like you greasers would be
using if conditions were reversed said

the captain but youre going to tell
me the truth when you dont im
going to slap your face it dont hurt
much now just makes you mad but
itll hurt like the devil along about an
hour from now-unless you get sense
and tell things straight now  whats
your game

  i-ive got to tell exclaimed the
mexican to braxton well-i sup-
pose it comes under the head of con-
spiring against a friendly power al-
though my lawyers will argue that the
fact is we are making plans to help the

cientifico-

  smack

  curse you im telling the truth
  smack

  my hand will last as long as your
tongue will said the captain listen
here hombre theres just one way
to stop me standing here and slapping
your face and thats to come through
well-we are gathering together
men in a few of the southern counties
to-he looked from side to side like
one who is hunted and seeks a way of
escape-to-to get ammunition-and
dynamite-to send across the border

  again daltons hand struck the
mexicans eyes glistened venomously
you see i know when youre lying
remarked the captain but i think
youre going to lose the habit shortly

  id rather be killed fighting
snarled azcona in spanish and made a
leap forward in a mad attempt to reach
one of daltons guns but the strong
hands of ranger carl caught him from
behind and forced him back into his
chair and as he writhed and struggled
there the captain slowly methodically
and without the slightest passion
slapped his face four times

  you see you aint going to get any
chance to die-either fightin or other-
wise dalton said youre just go-
ing to sit right there and get your face
slapped-over and over and over and


the populacr magazine

over-until you come clean with the
whole scheme

  it was rather sickening like abusing
a child waite had never seen anything
just like it he hoped he would not
again yet he realized the mexican
was not being seriously hurt-would
not be and before his mind came a
picture of the men and women and
children that would suffer when the sig-
nal flashed over the wires across south
texas and he no longer hated the pro-
cedure the end justified the means

  for perhaps ten minutes this went
on azcona snarled and fought then
he wept and begged and finally his
spirit broke and he told the story from
beginning to end not all at once
many times before he had finished the
rangers hand swung against his cheek
but after a while even a threat of it
sufficed

  it was indeed a mad plot that he
disclosed mad that is to say as re-
gards what it proposed to accomplish
which was the seizure of south texas
but not entirely mad from the stand-
point of the men behind the scheme
who did not expect it to actually suc-
ceed in that respect but did believe the
uprising would force intervention and
thus serve their personal fortunes

  it was a villa plan at least azcona
believed it was on the authority of
sauceda villa had everything to gain
by it and nothing to lose if indeed
it succeeded-if the insurgent mexi-
cans could seize and hold even for a
few days some fairly important texas
towns-then villa would be a national
hero in his own country if it failed
utterly yet towns were burned banks
looted and men and women killed on
such a wholesale scale as had been
planned presumably the united states
would enter mexico-and again villa
believed he would be the gainer as the
one about whom his fellow countrymen
would rally	

  the plot involved no less than twenty

cities and towns and in each the pro-
gram was similar to that which lopez
had outlined at mendon at a signal
there were to be fires killings and loot-
ing along the border an attempt
would be made to hold the towns per-
manently  farther north the plan was
to escape to the south with the stolen
property

  but it was in the south texas me-
tropolis itself that the scheme had been
most carefully worked out in no other
way could the villistas so well gain
their ends as to have it go forth to the
world that they had struck terror if
only for an hour into the hearts of
the city gringos in san antonio

  and this was the scheme at two
oclock in the morning three or four
serious fires would be set in widely sep-
arated parts of the city the firemen
and certain of the police would thus be
occupied ten minutes later at least
one bank-perhaps two-would be par-
tially wrecked by dynamite although in
san antonio the plotters had little ex-
pectation of actually getting at the con-
tents of the vaults coincident with
this the electric-light station would be
put out of business telephone wires in-
side the city and all telegraph wires
leading out would be cut and an at-
tempt would be made to seize the fed-
eral arsenal there are nearly thirty
bridges across the winding san antonio
river these were all to be destroyed
by dynamite simultaneously to hamper
police firemen and troops from the
army post

  before jnorning the raiders would all
escape and set out for the south at
least so the subordinates were being
told azcona confessed that he and
saucedas other lieutenants did not ex-
pect many san antonio raiders would
escape alive from the city but the fact
that those who took part would be
killed before morning would not alter
the incalculable damage they would
have done and the prestige they would
a fourfold game



have gained for pancho villa before
the americans got the upper hand he
admitted also that neither sauceda nor
any of the higher men at the junta ex-
pected to participate in the uprising
they were all planning to leave the city
just before it started

  they had gathered their funds in
various places a very little had come
from mexican sources much had been
contributed by the new york syndicate
a smaller amount had been given by
certain business interests-azcona
sobbingly insisted he didnt know their
identity until dalton finally believed him
-who were represented in san antonio
by mr henry cook

  and the signal for the uprising un-
less something should happen in the
meantime to make postponement ad-
visable was to be given three nights
later the form of the telegrams that
were to be sent varied copies of
the innocent-appearing messages that
should mean fire and explosion and
death were in saucedas safe

  the story was at last told and az-
cona sat shrunken in his chair a dishev-
eled trembling whimpering wreck

  now sir captain dalton turned
to braxton well hear from you
youre with the gang of financiers
thats putting up for this pretty little
orgy of murder as i understand it

  captain said waite earnestly i
give you my word of honor i didnt
know it i ask you to believe that i
am a good american i couldnt be a
party to a plot like this they told me
it was a plan to back the cientificos
in mexico i have every reason to feel
sure they told my principals that too
it was this man who came to new york
he saw the financial interests

  yes said azcona i saw them
old jeremiah stedman with his smug
face and his talk about the vested rights
of capital of course i told him the
cientifico story nobody would expect

me to tell the truth about it and of
course he knew i was lying if he
didnt he was a fool he knew i was
lying and i knew he knew i was lying
he wants his rotten money to be pro-
tected in mexico and hes willing to
shut his eyes to how its done if this
thing had gone through and brought
about intervention hed have been sat-
isfied enough never mind how many
men got killed in texas hed have
lifted his eyes in pious horror when
he heard about it but hed have been
satisfied just the same-until he found
out intervention in mexico didnt mean
conquering mexico

  braxton ignored azcona playing his
own part captain he said i may
have violated the federal law in get-
ting mixed into this but i ask you to
believe me as man to man when i
say i had no part in this plot im
no associate of murderers

  you azcona fairly screamed his
veneer of courtesy was worn down to
the truth beneath his eyes were bright
with concentrated bitterness his lips
were- drawn back so that his teeth
showed even at the corners of his
mouth cowed beaten overwhelmed
facing a prison term and after it a
knife thrust in the dark should his con-
federates learn who had betrayed them
he flamed with the hatred of race for
race you are no associate of mur-
derers no and you are not fit to
associate w ith men either

  his words fell over one another
mingled with sobs the mans nerve
was broken and he let himself go
wildly saying with his lips exactly what
he felt in his heart

  we have called you yankees chil-
dren of dogs-we mexicans-and
pushed you off our sidewalks and spit
in your faces and you would not fight
we have flooded your mines and
wrecked  your machinery and confis-
cated your lands and you would not
fight we have tortured your men and


i the popular magazine

stolen your women and killed your chil-
dren and you would not fight we
have crossed your borders and raided
your towns and burned yohr houses
and shot your people in your own
streets-and you would not fight if
we were to blow up half texas you
would watch and wait to see if we really
meant it youre a pack of white-liv-
ered cowards and every man in the
world with red blood despises you-
and ought to by all the saints i hope
when they get time after the great
war some nation of real men-i dont
care which-comes and wipes your hyp-
ocritical money-grubbing race off the
face of the earth you to act con-
temptuous of me pah he spat on
the floor at his feet

  thatll be about all for now re-
marked captain dalton decisively i
cant exactly say your sentiments are
news to me but at the same time i
dont admire to hear em-so i wont
any more

  he turned to his brother willing
to take your automobile out and do a
little piece of wgrk for the state thatll
keep you up all night he asked

  shore thing

  take ranger carl and this frothin
hombre up to austin have him locked
up he said to carl and kept incom-
unicado until i send word to the con-
trary and then come right back ill
take care of this other prisoner myself

chapter xix

face to face

  into town ordered braxton as
blossom looked to him and the captain
for instructions after azcona had de-
parted handcuffed in carls charge
its nearly one oclock he said to
dalton as they got under way is
there anything more we can do to-
night or had we better get to bed and
start early to-morrow

  we could get at the sheriff and chief

of police but i dont see that it wont
keep just as well until mawnin theyll
be busy enough the next two or three
days no need of breakin their rest
youre in charge of course just how
are you fixin to bring about the
round-up 

  we want to get all the gang we
can when we make the raid but it is
even more important it seems to me
that wre get that list of names and those
telegraph forms im afraid even after
we make the arrests somebody that
we miss might send some of those mes-
sages if sauceda had planned to use
the same form for all the towns it
would be a simple matter to warn the
telegraph companies and stop them but
with a different form for each local
leader all reading innocently enough
it would be impossible the telegraph
companies cant hold up every message
filed with them that happens to be ad-
dressed to a mexican name in nearly
thirty cities

  your idea then is-

  some plan whereby sauceda will
get no chance to destroy those papers
after the raid begins it wouldnt take
a minute you know and i dont see
any better way than for me to be in
the house there-with him-when the
arrests are made if necessary i can
prevent him from burning them or tear-
ing them up i hope i wont have to
do anything that will identify me but
if i have to why i have to i dont
think it is advisable for me to see the
sheriff or the police either paynes
man-the one that will be in charge of
the raid-will take care of that and
id be mighty well pleased if you would
o with him if i can get through the
row without being known paynes man
will arrest me with the others just as
you did to-night

 that reminds me when payne
left me this evening after you had
gone to get azcona he asked me to tell
you he would file a telegram to your
a fourfold game



chief right away telling him what was
going on

  good now as to to-morrow we
shall want your help of course and
the help of the sheriff and the police
too it will have to be a quick raid-a
good-sized crowd of officers swarming
in from every direction and jumping
the gang not enough to fall over each
other of course but enough to make a
fight useless the more men we have
within reason the less chance of some-
body getting hurt

  i wouldnt hesitate if it was neces-
sary to take in that whole crowd with
two other rangers

  and you could do it undoubtedly
but you might have to kill somebody
i should expect to replied the cap-
tain darkly thats why mexicans
have got respect for the rangers
were watchful but we dont do much
waitin however youre the boss
payne will have three men you
and your men make six my idea is to
ask the sheriff and chief of police for
four each that will give us more than
a dozen men to arrest probably not more
than seven or eight-ten say if were
in big luck

  plenty and if you dont mind i
think ill order two or three of my men
that are near enough to get there into
some of these towns where theyve got
the most hombres on their lists-men-
don for instance and a couple of
others ill send one man to each place
and hell be there in time to help the
sheriff make the round-up when you
telegraph em the names therell need
to be a little pressure applied in each
town too to these captains of ten to
find out who the ten are lawdy
theres goin to be so many greasers
in some of these here little jails within
the next three or four days that their
arms and laigs will be stickin out of
the windows

  friend said waite to the chauf-
feur who had been driving with eyes
b p

dead ahead but his ears fairly wriggling
with what he was overhearing both
captain dalton and i like that pretty
little badge you wear in your coat
where did you get it

  master hiram no  state o
maine replied blossom promptly

  we like the way you listen and
dont talk can we depend on you to
help us out a little to-morrow night-
that is to say to-night its morning
now

  yes sir you can declared blos-
som surest thing you know of
course you understand i aint no fightin
character i dont want to get into
no trouble be in any shootin scrapes
or anything i always ben a man of
peace as you might say but anything
i can do to help you gentlemen out-
and i gather from what you say im
helpin the government out too-im
with you and i wont overcharge you
none for the automobile either

  fine well i want you and the car
about half past eight oclock at the
edgewood youll take me fut near
a place on san sebastian avenue and
wait on a side street just around the
corner until the captain or i tells you
to do something else to dalton he
added well use the car for pris-
oners perhaps and we may seize a let
of stuff well want to take in a hurry
to the federal building

  the chauffeur nodded ill be there

mr- oh excuse me 

  braxton said waite of new
york and im also known more or
less around here as correon

  i getcher i aint exactly sure just
what kind of a deteckative you are
but youre a yankee and youre after
a bunch of mexicans say gentlemen
ive ben around quite a lot and i
figure on tryin to be liberal and broad-
minded but i dont like em i hate
to say it but rich or poor whtte or
black i cant ge used to thinkin of
em as folks well im mum silent


the cpcpulr magazine

as the grave as the feller says you
can bank on me mr braxton and
its ben a pleasure to meet you

  they were running now into the
business section of the city on the far-
ther side of which lay the edgewood
i suppose we might as well go to the
hotel then and get to bed there doesnt
seem to be anything else to plan to-
night said waite

  id like to stop first at the tele-
graph office to send those wires to my
men telling em to hustle for those
towns where theyll be handy when we
need em

  commerce street was directly on
their way and blossom turned into it
the wide thoroughfare lay practically
deserted before them under the elec-
tric lights its stores and office build-
ings were dark save where two tele-
graph offices side by side sent out bril-
liant splotches of light across the
sidewalk in the distance a policeman
stood chatting with a night watchman
who had come out of a high building
and was sitting on the curb near at
hand in front of the telegraph office
which dalton sought stood a taxicab
blossom drew up behind it and cap-
tain dalton alighted and went ahead
and in through the doorway

  nervous from the events of the night
waite said something to blossom about
getting out to stretch his muscles and
climbed to the sidewalk to walk back
and forth as he came abreast of the
taxi he saw through the telegraph-
office wrindow the ranger captain busy
with pen and blanks he stood idly
looking in his face full in the glare
of the light that streamed from the
interior

  then he was conscious that a woman
had turned from the desk and was com-
ing out through the door and that it
was esther lynde in a twinkling they
were face to face not six feet apart 

  if he had wanted to turn and run
away he could not have done so he

realized he stood almost literally in the
limelight it would be absurd that she
had not recognized himhe must make
the best of it and act as naturally as
he could in the fraction of a second
given him in which to make up his
mind he had no time to wonder what
the girl was doing at that hour of the
morning in a telegraph office

  he forced a look of pleased grati-
fication to come over his face and took
a step toward her raising his hat and
extending his hand

  why miss lynde he exclaimed
this is indeed a surprise and a pleas-
ure 

  the girl at sight of him had paused
almost imperceptibly then come on
there was no responsive smile on her
face

  how do you do she said her
face he thought was a little white and
her eyes-they looked very dark in this
light-were strained she looked into
his eyes then down at his still extended
hand then back into his eyes again
and she did not take his hand nor did
she speak further

  he realized suddenly that he was
blocking her way and he stepped back
lamely fumbling in his mind for the
right thing to do and feeling very young
and somehow in the wrong then as
something seemed necessary to be said
and she remained silent

 this is- i dont understand

excuse me if i have offended in any
way but i-

  he hesitated feeling he was not say-
ing the right thing but entirely at a
loss as to what the right thing might be

  you have done nothing to offend
me personally she said with slow pre-
cise coldness it merely happens that
since i saw you last  have learned
what you really are so i do not care
to shake hands with you that is all

  he stepped back still farther help-
less for words he could think of
nothing to say so he bowed with as
a foucrfoud game



much dignity as her own she moved
on to the waiting taxicab entered it
and it whirred away when captain
dalton emerged from the telegraph
office five minutes later braxton was
walking up and down the sidewalk with
his hands behind his back and his head
bowed and not until the ranger spoke
to himra second time did he come out
of his abstraction

  it was clear enough somehow she
had learned of his connection with the
service andshe hated him for it well
it was a price he must pay for serving
a different power than she their brief
congenial acquaintanceship was over
and for all time ships they had been
that passed in the night and spoke each
other in passing he had told himself
ever since that bitter hour when he
faced the gale on the lampasas that
he and she could never be anything to
one another not even friends and
yet down in his heart of hearts he
had hoped-but hope was now dead
and buried

  then it came to him that if esther
lynde knew who he was so also in
all probability did henry cook and
only the day before he had seen cook
and sauceda together

chapter xx

the raid at saucedas

  immediately after breakfast braxton
dalton and payne got together to plan
their day payne had already set his
three men to work and had secured
the cooperation of ellery marsh a fed-
eral agent permanently located in texas
and known to the san antonio officials
to take active charge of the raid marsh
and captain dalton went to call on
the chief of police and sheriff and re-
ported an hour or two later that those
officials as was to be expected had
joined enthusiastically in their plans
it was decided to make the raid at ex-
actly nine-thirty oclock if lieutenants

of sauceda visited the house and left
it before that hour each would be sep-
arately followed and quietly arrested
when he had reached some place where
no rumor of the incident could get back
to the junta in time to warn the others

  braxton through sleepless hours had
wrestled with the problem of whether
or not he ought to change his plans
because of the sudden knowledge that
esther lynde had discovered his iden-
tity he could not think however of
any way to do so and still make certain
the lists of names and the telegraph
messages would not be destroyed if
sauceda knew who and what he was
and he were putting himself in danger
by going to the house that was a chance
he must take as part of the days work

  at two in the afternoon sauceda
called him on the telephone to ask him
if he had any knowledge as to the
whereabouts of azcona he had an-
ticipated some such inquiry and pre-
pared for it so he replied

  senor azcona no general i have
not seen him to-day i havent hap-
pened to drop into the bonham

  he is not at the bonham where
did you leave him last evening

  at the corner by the madison club
you had taken supper there  that
they had not taken supper there could
be quite easily ascertained

  no when we reached the corner
by the club senor azcona said he was
feeling a bit tired and thought he would
go on to his hotel if i would excuse
him so ave said good night

  he did not sleep in his room at the
bonham the clerks do not remember
his coming in

  that is odd he especially men-
tioned to me that he was going to his
hotel perhaps he had some matter-
some matter of business-that he did
not wish to mention

  i am quite sure he did not i am
in his confidence we had an appoint-
ment for this morning and when he


the cpovulatr magazine

did not appear i called the hotel he
certainly did not go there

  braxtons tone was solicitous he
may have been taken ill or met with an
accident have you called the hos-
pitals 

  no but i shall-at once thank
you senor

 when you find him i wish you
would let me know there are so many
automobile accidents these days and
he might be unconscious i shall be
quite anxious until i hear

  he heard nothing more from sau-
ceda during the afternoon at eight-
thirty blossom clearly excited with an-
ticipation was at the edgewood and
waite drove away with him captain
dalton had already gone to meet the
sheriff and chief of police who were
going to lead their men in person

  he stopped the car on the nearest
side street to the house of the junta
where blossom was to await further
orders then he strolled leisurely
around the corner passed the inevitable
guard of two on saucedas front gal-
lery and entered saucedas front room
at nine oclock he observed as he
went up the walk the usual mexican
rocking in the chair by the side of the
house under the fig tree

  a young lieutenant named ramos
whom he had seen once or twice was
with the general braxton introduced
the subject of the missing azcona him-
self asking if he had yet appeared

  no said sauceda and it is very
strange i have telephoned all the hos-
pitals no one of his description is un-
conscious or delirious in any of them
the police waites tone was in-
quiring

  sauceda shrugged his shoulders
hardly he said inquiries in that
direction might not be profitable nev-
ertheless we have investigated through
friends who are at times able to get
information at headquarters and they

cannot learn that he has been the sub-
ject of any police report

  i feel solicitous said waite he
seemed in good health and spirits when
he left me

  we are sparing no pains to get track
of him sauceda assured braxton
the matter dropped there

  waite had thought out a very plausi-
ble suggestion as to getting rifles smug-
gled across the border in various places
if a continued embargo on arms should
make it impossible for them to be
shipped across openly and after a little
he launched into an explanation of his
idea sauceda and ramos listened with
more than respect in fact they both
agreed his scheme sounded very reason-
able and were disposed to adopt it he
had foreseen this so long as their
cientifico army plot was purely imagi-
nary and they had no intention of run-
ning guns across the river one plan
to do it was as well worth agreeing to
as another

  and this brought the discussion to
a point where it would be well to know
how many men could be depended upon
in each of the border counties to assist
in such a smuggling plan as waite was
proposing he asked in an entirely
natural manner to see the lists

  sauceda took the papers from the
safe the door of which was open it
was twenty minutes after nine waite
noticed when he got the sheets in his
hand he now had possession of the
lists of captains of ten and he had no
doubt the telegraph forms were in the
safe there could hardly be any reason
for them to be anywhere else until the
night of the uprising his remaining
task was to talk against time for ten
minutes

  he did not attempt to note any of
the names on the lists or otherwise
to do anything that might arouse sus-
picion but merely proceeded to tabulate
a total of the members of the band in
each of the border counties in dis-
a fchjtrfoud game



cussing this he listed as a border county
one that is a hundred miles north of
the river and had to be set right with
the help of a map and he lost track of
his totals at one point and had to go
back and eliminate a county whose
members he had counted twice

  while this was going on ramos ex-
cused himself and went into the back
room where his voice could be heard
in conversation with others five or
six minutes had elapsed when some one
came up the walk onto the gallery and
after a subdued conversation tomas
knocked at the door

  a friend-lopez of mendon he
announced on immediate and impor-
tant business

  after a little frowned sauceda
just now i am engaged he glanced
significantly at braxton who had not
looked up

  even so my general i think you
would see him-and even now replied
tomas and turning brought lopez
into the room and stood beside him
closing the door and standing with his
back to it

- a thousand pardons apologized
lopez while braxton kept his face
averted as much as he might without
losing sight of the position of tomas
and the newcomer i am disturbed in
my mind i think and think and fear
perhaps i should report so i come on

the train-

  cease this wind of words com-
manded sauceda can you not wait
a little  there is no train back to men-
don to-night wait outside

  but i have told this good friend
insisted lopez indicating tomas and
he says i should not wait was it
right that i reported so fully to the
man you sent--about the dynamite and
the plans for our great nights work
saucedas face set in so vicious a
glare that the man shrank back fright-
ened what man he demanded
too terror-stricken to speak lopez

twirling his hat in his hands and wetting
his lips looked from sauceda around
to tomas by the door and from tomas
to braxton waite moved his feet back
slowly to enable him to rise with one
leap and measured the distance to get
his back against the wall for a sec-
ond only lopez stared into waites

face then-

  this man he cried a look of re-
lief passed over his face i see he
is indeed all right as he said he
breathed i feared as i thought and
thought and put together what i had
reported to him yesterday--

  sauceda was staring through nar-
rowed eyes at waite

  what is this senor he asked and
there was suspicion fear and above
all menace in his low voice

  shall not those who are spending
the money know that it is being well
spent demanded braxton he had
only one minute more to gain if the
raiders were exactly on time i am
merely sitting into the game as i an-
nounced

  sauceda considered this and him and
there was an ominous pause it was
broken by a sharp tap at the window
back of saucedas chair-the window
that looked out on the rocking-chair
under the fig tree the lists were all
under braxtons hand where they could
be gathered with one clutch

  the general opened the window in-
stantly

  there are men said the guard out-
side the window eight or ten or
maybe twelve all gringos they look
as if they were all coming here

  before sauceda could begin to form
his answer the door into the back room
opened and ramos stood upon the
threshold

  there are men on the other side
of the fence back of the garden he
said two or three of them

  the front door came open without
the customary knock and the com-


the popular magazine

panion of tomas came in men com-
ing he exclaimed neither of the
other guards had raised his voice in
giving the warning neither did this
one their voices were hurried but
soft gringos he added many
of them

  the man just outside the window
under the fig tree gave an exclamation
and disappeared in the direction of the
back of the house stop cried a
strange voice in that direction there
was a pistol shot a yelp of pain a suc-
cession of cries voices raised in con-
fusion came from the back room into
which ramos had vanished at the shot
slamming the door behind him as he
went

  as quickly as he had entered the
house the second guard from in front
dashed out and jose lopez of mendon
followed him their feet sounded on
the gallery as they ran toward its end
and leaped for the shadow that lay
between saucedas house and the next
one sounds of a struggle followed

  all these things took perhaps ten sec-
onds during which braxton sprang to
his feet the papers containing the list
of names in his hand

  sauceda kept his head fie leaned
across the table quick those pa-
pers  to me he commanded

  waite stared dazedly at the general
without comprehension as though over-
come with panic he backed away a
step or two and looked from door to
door his hands clutching the lists
shook he seemed paralyzed by fear

  the papers  in your hand give
them here sauceda demanded again
he measured the distance he would
have to cover to get around the table
to take them by force and the time it
would take to do it the steps out-
side were coming very close to the gal-
lery

  tomas smiling his smile that was
more sinister than a frown his eyes on
the general for orders locked the front

door took out the key and dropped it
in his pocket

  take them tomas cried sauceda
destroy them

  waite could not fight them both and
retain the lists just beside him the
door of the safe stood open with al-
most one motion-for tomas was cov-
ering the distance between them
crouched like a football tackle-he
threw all the papers into the safe
slammed the door and spun the com-
bination as he stooped to do this
tomas was upon him

  it is done they cannot get them
now he cried hoping to deceive both
mexicans into thinking he had misun-
derstood the generals meaning but
tomas did not seem to hear and as
he straightened to meet the rush he
saw the mexican had drawn a knife
and was swinging it as he leaped

  waite got the mans wrist with his
left hand and tried to draw his auto-
matic from his hip pocket but tomas
was equally quick and also seized his
right wrist

  kill him he was with azcona
he went to mendon cursed gringo
spy sauceda was snarling out of
the corner of his eye waite saw the
bandit general dragging open the table
drawer

  his grip on tomas wrist was slip-
ping and the mexican was using all
the leverage of his powerful shoulders
to force the knife downward and in-
ward kick in the door quick
somebody shouted outside

  at a distance but almost as though
it were an echo of that command a
voice cried in spanish they are
rangers then several things hap-
pened so close together that afterward
waite could hardly array them in their
proper order

  tomas by a sudden violent effort
threw braxton back across the safe and
tore himself loose surprisingly then
as waite expected the drive of the
a foucrfolcd game



knife the mexican turned and dashed
for the open window behind sauceda
his fear of the rangers had weighed
the scale in the americans favor

  the door jarred gave and at the
second attack came crashing in

  sauceda got the table drawer open
and his hand came into view above it
holding an automatic pistol he fired
at braxton point-blank

  as he pulled the trigger tomas leap-
ing toward the window collided with
his arm the bullet went wild sau-
ceda cursed and swung the gun back
to fire again

  captain dalton from the doorway
flipped his pistol from his holster and
fired from the hip twice so rapidly
that the two reports sounded almost
like one sauceda bent forward at the
waist as though he were hinged and
the automatic went clattering to the
floor as he sprawled forward across the
table he lay as he fell motionless
his face grotesquely twisted to one side

  coincident with the rangers shots
came the leap of tomts out through
the window he cleared the sash and
landed on the ground beneath he ran
there was a shot outside-two more
damn  i missed him cried a voice

  as the last of this succession of
incidents took place braxton was
straightening up from the top of th
safe across which he had been hurled
two seconds before by tomas

  the raid was over as quickly as it
had begun waite looked mechanically
at his watch it was twenty-eight min-
utes of ten

  for the benefit of the mexicans 
braxton was taken out a prisoner by
dalton he joined in the yard a sad
company seven it numbered-only
tomas had escaped

  while still inside waite had found
opportunity to apprise marsh the fed-
eral agent in charge of the location
of the lists and presumably of  the tele-
graph forms officials searched the

house taking all papers presently an
express wagon drove up and men be-
gan to load the safe to be taken to
the federal building and there opened
while they were at it the coroner came
to view the body of sauceda

  then a patrol wagon drove up and
the officers began to herd the prisoners
toward it

  this man declared captain dal-
ton harshly indicating braxton was
standing over the safe when we went
in he may know the combination ill
take him along with me to the federal
building and see if i can make him
remember it

  the others were taken away and the
captain went with waite back into the
house where ranger carl and a police-
man remained in charge to give the
curious crowd that had collected a
chance to partially disperse after a
time they went out of the house by
a back door and over a fence toward
the side street where the automobile
waited

  as they came up to it they were sur-
prised to see two men there where
they had expected to find only one
one of the pair was half sitting half
lying on the floor of the car in front
of the drivers seat groaning cursing
and threatening the other was stand-
ing over him from time to time bran-
dishing an enormous monkey wrench

  tomas exclaimed braxton

  i think hes a bad mexicanr sput-
tered blossom still waving the monkey
wrench in dangerous proximity to the
mans head he come runnin out
through this alley back here wavin a
knife an jabbered something at me in
his lingo and then he said i had to drive
him somewhere or he would kill me
he was goin to steal my automobile
what do you think of that

  why didnt you shoot him  asked
dalton

  shoot him goodness mr dalton
i dont know nothin about a pistol i


the wpular magazine

got one at home but i dont never
carry it in the automobile i used to
but i got so worried havin it around
loaded that it bothered my drivin no
sir i just smashed him a few with
this monkey wrench the first swipe
made him drop the knife i guess
mebbe i broke his arm

  to a hospital in the name of the
saints  protested tomas this incar-
nate devil has murdered me

  t dont know what hes sayin said
blossom earnestly but im awful glad
youve come gosh i ben scared i
aint no rough character you know i
never fight i dont even know how

chapter xxi

two surprises

  at ten oclock the following morning
braxton shouted come to the knock
at his door and payne entered waite
had not left the room since he entered
it after midnight it had been agreed
before he went to bed that he had best
remain in seclusion it would not do
for him to be seen at large by mexicans
who might be aware of his supposed
arrest the evening before he had
eaten breakfast in his room had cele-
brated the day by removing his beard
and saluting as an old friend his clean-
shaven face in the mirror and was im-
patiently awaiting some report from the
activities of his associates

  everything is going great declared
payne at once ramos has come
through with a confession that backs up
azconas and therell be more before
night there isnt a thing to keep you
here you can get out on an evening
train

  it would be bad if i had to come
back for the trials said braxton

  no fear of that neither you nor
i will be needed until then the mex-
icans who know you will suppose you
are awaiting trial in some other prison
or perhaps out on bail when the trials

come off i will have marsh start a ru-
mor that certain new york financial
interests put enough pressure on wash-
ington to get you released

  i suppose after i left you last night
marsh gave copies of all those tele-
grams in the safe to the different tele-
graph companies 

  sure not one of those messages
could be sent now even if it were filed
and even if one of them happened to
get by i imagine the bad hombres to
the south of us are having their hands
too full to-day to pay much attention
to it i heard from dalton a little while
ago he is going to meet us here as
soon as he gets time i gathered from
his laconic remarks that his boys and
the sheriffs down below are gathering
in one magnificent harvest

  payne took from his pocket a plain
unaddressed envelope

  here is a letter for you he said
came in my mail from the chief this
morning

  waite opened it the note was in
the chiefs handwriting but bore neither
address nor date and the three initials
that were signed to it were the same
three-none of them an initial of the
chiefs name-that had appeared at the
bottom of the radiogram waite had re-
ceived at sea instructing him to for-
gather immediately with cameron in
new york excuse me he said to
payne and read

  my dear friend i have just returned
from a little trip with a quite well-known
gentleman who has asked me to write you
expressing his personal appreciation of
services rendered in connection with a cer-
tain note of which he has seen a copy he
wants me to say to you that as soon as you
have returned from your present visit to
the southwest he would like me to bring
you to his home in order that he may thank
you in person

  it will interest you to know that the note
to which i refer was along lines similar to a
former one that was to have been carried to
the same parties several years ago but the
delivery of which was prevented by a seri-
a fourfolfd game



ous accident to the messenger the plan
which it proposed was a very interesting
one but became useless once we were
known to be aware of it and i can inform
you that word already has been unofficially
communicated to certain energetic little peo-
ple that we know the contents of the mes-
sage and the plan that was afoot has been
thereby ruined

  i hope to see you as soon as your present
business is completed

  he handed the letter to payne
 along lines similar to a former note
that was to have been carried to the
same parties several years ago 
quoted payne when he had read it
twice similar that is to say to the
message don gustavo was about to take
as special ambassador to tokyo when
huerta put an end to that by killing
him and weve put japan wise un-
officially to the fact that we are onto
the game well i can readily see how
that would ruin the whole scheme as
the chief says japan had to make the
first move and it had to look innocent
she cannot make it now that she under-
stands the united states will know ex-
actly what it means and the part that
germany was invited to take cannot be
done unless japan has first started
things so it looks thanks be as
though the whole business were pretty
well blown up

  the chief seems sure of it and he
naturally is in touch with the state de-
partment said waite

  captain bob dalton knocked and en-
tered there was a satisfied smile on
his tanned face and his eyes glinted
with cold jubilation

  remember what i said a couple o
nights ago about laigs and arms stickin
out of the windows of country jails
he inquired as he shut the door i
reckon from what reports im gettin
theyve done got to that stage already
i guess before night theyll be figurin
on buildin additions its shore some
round-up

  it seems too bad we had to leave

you and marsh to do all this work
said braxton thats the penalty of
hiving to keep our identity secret we
start lots of things but we cant be
present at the finish

  as far as im concerned you neednt
worry about its bein too bad ex-
claimed the ranger i certainly do
appreciate you fellers invitin me to sit
into the game with you that-a-way
nothin could have given me greater
pleasure

  waite took a train that night for the
north in order to avoid possible iden-
tification at the railroad station he had
himself driven by automobile to new
braunfels-the next good-sized station
north of san antonio-and boarded it
there payne by the chiefs orders
was to remain in san antonio to
secretly oversee the continuing round-
up

  he had plenty of time before he
reached washington to review in his
mind that last meeting with esther
lynde which the excitement of swift-
moving events had temporarily pushed
into the background the wound he
found was very fresh and sore why
when he had met the woman that he
knew to be the only woman had fate
played him so scurvy a trick  he tried
to be philosophical but philosophy does
not come easy at twenty-nine this
bitterness of spirit dampened the ela-
tion he otherwise would have felt over
the successful completion of his two
latest tasks and it was in no especially
cheerful frame of mind that he arrived
in washington and found word await-
ing him at his hotel that the chief had
made an appointment for them to call
at the white house that noon

  the president was gravely cordial
and expressed a sincere appreciation of
his services congratulating both him
and the nation that he had done his
share to prevent a situation that in time
might have developed a desperate crisis
when braxton and the chief came out


the popular magazine

upon the avenue waite was glowing
with satisfaction and justifiable pride

  as they passed through the corridors
of the building in which are the offices
of the service there was a woman in
the hallway ahead of them she turned
a corner and passed out of sight with-
out looking back almost at the moment
waite saw her but there was no mis-
taking that figure and carriage brax-
ton grasped the chiefs arm

  did you notice that young woman 
he asked the one who went to the
right 

  i saw there was one i cant say
i observed her very closely

  chief said waite earnestly have
her watched immediately this prob-
ably means some leak right here in the
office her name is lynde and she
is a mighty competent german secret
agent i wonder how she got here so
soon i thohght i left her in san an-
tonio she must have started for here
about the same time i did by a different
road

  the chief unlocked a door and they
passed into his private office without
going through the outer room as the
chief closed the door he asked what
is her name did you say

  lynde esther lynde

  the chief had his finger on a push
button an attendant opened the door
from the outer office

  fairbanks said the chief there is
a lady in the building named lynde-t
miss esther lynde i think she went
into mr harrisons room bring her
here at once please

  really-i-i dont want to inter-
fere but-really-shes too clever-al-
together too clever-for you to learn
her business by putting it up to her
sharp like this waite protested and
chief-as a personal favor-i-ive met
miss lynde dont be too hard on
her

  well see replied the chief shortly
he waved his hand toward a chair and

began to study an accumulation of mem-
oranda on his desk braxton sat down
not more than three minutes elapsed
and the door opened miss lynde
sir announced fairbanks and esther
stepped into the room as she caught
sight of waite who had risen her face
was a study in conflicting emotions sur-
prise predominating why-i didnt
know they brought you here she ex-
claimed i thought you were in-

  the chief sitting at his desk inter-
rupted her do you know this man 
he asked sharply

  yes sir

  who is he

  she hesitated and when she replied
it was in a low voice as though she
were reluctant he is waite braxton
a representative of the universal oil
company her voice fell still lower
and-a member of the conspiracy to
bring about the uprising in south
texas

  willing to get americans killed to
help along a financial game eh said
the chief most surprisingly almost
as bad as being a traitor

  the girl looked helplessly at waite
and back to the chief that is true
she almost whispered but-he must
have been terribly tempted i feel sure
if you could take that into consideration
-could be as merciful as possible un-
der the circumstances-

  brattons jaw had dropped at the
chiefs words and for a moment he was
speechless now he stammered why

-how-you dont- but the chief

motioned him to silence and there was
an odd expression on his face as he
said -

  thats very kind of you miss
lynde you will be glad to know that
mr braxton just before you came in
asked me not to be any harder on you
than i had to be

  it was the girls turn to look blank
hard on me she repeated

  exactly it seems you are a very
a foucrfoud game



dangerous german spy the chief
sprang to his feet briskly and addressed
them both and he was smiling i
guess it is time one set of incognitos
in this office got stretched a little he
said miss lynde valued member of
the department let me present mr
braxton equally valued member

 you a- both of them said it

in chorus and stopped but-

again they spoke the same word to-
gether then they stared at one an-
other like a pair of newly met dromios
and then suddenly they laughed

  sit down both of you said the
chief resuming his chair there are
quite a number of things you ought to
enjoy talking over together and as i
havent seen either of you for two
months you can save my time by telling
me certain things in each others pres-
ence for instance how did it happen
that you both got copies of the cipher
message to japan you to braxton
sent me one copy by williams the
night before you left for france and
you to miss lynde sent me exactly
the same cipher by carson on exactly
the same train

  braxton was the first to answer

well ill be blessed i- he

grinned at the thought i stole it
from miss lynde to her look of
mystification he added i had the en-
velope opened and its contents copied
between the time we arrived in new
york and the time i had to meet you
at the van wouter then his mind
flew back to the first time he had seen
the cipher in her possession and the
smile left his face but you how
did you get those papers from calderon
-and when 

  i didnt get them from calderon
she replied i didnt even know cal-
deron had them-until afterward mv
work in mexico city was to keep track
of german activities ive been on that
sort of duty ever since i entered the
service two years ago my education

in germany especially fits me for it i
suppose

  but you had those papers when you
came down frorrw the third floor of the
presidente that night just after cal-
deron was killed i saw them the
corner showed in your bodice

  goodness that was careless ex-
claimed the girl but the whole thing
was terribly upsetting i never was
more shaken in all my life

  lets hear about it suggested the
chief

  when you learned that captain von
arnoldt was on his way to mexico city
and sent me to keep track of him she
said we got rooms in the same hotel
as he it wasnt possible to get them
on the same floor at that time captain
von arnoldt was on the fourth floor
and the carsons and i were on the
third

  excuse me interrupted braxton
but are the carsons also-

  yes that is to say they are at-
tached to me when i am at work they
are really my cousins-quite distant
ones they dont have much wrk to
do except make my presence on a case
plausible and keep their own counsel
and they do both perfectly well

  that night in the presidente i was
nearly through dressing when the page
brought up mr braxtons card she
continued addressing the chief we
had become acquainted that afternoon
he rescued me from a nasty little street
riot i sent word i would be down in
a few minutes and finished dressing
then i turned off the electric light in
my room and stepped to the door evi-
dently i had neglected to close it when
the page brought up the card it stood
open the tiniest crack-perhaps an inch

  outside the door was a balcony that
encircles the patio there are seats
around the sides between the doors of
the rooms-seats with movable leather
cushions the lights were on over the


the povulaii magazine

balcony of course i could see what
was going on there while a person out-
side my room being dark would not
even notice my door was ajar

  i had reached the door and was
just on the point of opening it when
a door in the wall at right angles to
mine opened and a man came out
quickly and shut it behind him he was
crouched and hurrying as though there
were something back in the room from
which he wanted to escape i saw then
that it was the japanese elevator man
there was no reason why he should
be coming out of a guests room and
where at first i had seen him by acci-
dent from that moment i had my eye
to that crack in the door watching him

  he made two soft-footed leaps to-
ward the railing about the patio and
looked cautiously over then tiptoe-
ing very carefully he set out to walk
around toward the stairs he had some-
thing in his hand-something white at
this moment cousin mary came to her
door took hold of the knob and it
sounded as though she were coming out
she told me afterward that she had
started to do so and had gone back to
wait because cousin thomas wasnt
quite ready at any rate she didnt
open the door

  at the sound the jap turned and
ran directly toward me i suppose he
thought he was going to be discovered
and made up his mind not to have the
cipher in his possession if he should
be arrested he came to the wall seat
not two yards from where i stood
tucked the white package under a
cushion turned like lightning and ran
to the stairs and up them two steps at
a time the moment he had disap-
peared i stepped out and got the en-
velope-on general principles mysteri-
ous papers in japanese hands might
prove worth having then i saw there
were fresh stains on it-bloodstains i
realized something serious had hap-
pened behind the door of room no 

all the more reason to expect the en-
velope might be important

  with the possibility of some crime
so near me it was advisable that i
get off that floor just as quickly as i
could i didnt dare take the time to
go back to my room to hide the en-
velope and i feared a search of all the
rooms anyway so i called to cousin
mary that i had gone on without them
and hurried down the stairs that ex-
plains how nervous i was when mr
payne announced that colonel calderon
had been murdered i saw the japa-
nese again when the police were ques-
tioning him he had plunged his hands
into grease to hide the stains that must
have been on them i imagine he went
back to recover his hidden papers later
and found them gone

  after you and mr payne had left
that night i opened the envelope and
found it contained what was apparently
some sort of national cipher i burned
the envelope of course the next
morning captain von arnoldt told me
he had decided to sail for new york
so i came with him-until the british
took him off the ship-and brought the
papers with me

  but why did you intrust them to
me braxton asked

  because i was nervous that night
von arnoldt had lost his papers and i
felt as though some one were watching
me you were strong and competent
and would not be suspected of having
them and i felt i could trust you
didnt i explain all that to you when
i asked you to take them well i
found a message in new york from the
chief sending me on an errand to mon-
treal so i sent them over by cousin
thomas then i went from montreal
direct to san antonio and ive never
heard yet what they were was it an
important cipher she asked the chief

  so important that braxton went
from here to mexico city especially to
get it at any cost and the japanese
a fourfold game



secret service learning somehow that
calderon had been bribed to make a
copy killed him to keep the message
from reaching us i told the president
two people were responsible for our
securing the note he thanked braxton
this noon i have an appointment for
him to thank you to-morrow at eleven

 was your mother german-and
were you born in berlin asked brax-
ton

  my mothers grandfather fought in
the revolution she smiled but the
rest of it was almost true berlin-
massachusetts-is only about fifteen
miles from worcester and i was born
in worcester

  you went to san antonio then

  get acquainted with german secret-
service men-or rather one very popu-
lar young german secret-service man
i thought i never would get him to tell
me much as he likes the flattering at-
tention of young women it took a
terrible lot of anti-allies talk i can
assure you he wasnt really back of
the uprising of course just encour-
aged it as a matter of general policy
i telegraphed the chief what they were
planning-but i forget you were on
that of course

  you both seem to have got the facts
regarding it at just about the same
time remarked the chief the tele-
gram saying braxton had uncovered
the scheme reached here a little before
midnight one- night and yours miss
lynde about four hours later

  he rose and his face was severe
although one who knew him unusually
well might have discovered the trace of
a twinkle in his eyes there is one
thing neither of you has explained he
said and im afraid it is going to
prove pretty hard to do so

  what is it they both asked to-
gether

  how- he spoke impressively

how does it happen that in all your
reports to this office neither of you
found it necessary to mention the per-
nicious activities of the other i do
not recall that either of you has even
written the others name

  waite felt the color rising to his
cheeks he glanced sidewise at the
girl her face too was flushing

  the whir of an electric buzzer proved
a welcome diversion excuse me a
minute said the chief ill be back
shortly

  they had risen to their feet she
was slowly polishing a corner of the
chiefs desk with the end of one middle
finger as though a little spot there
needed to be dusted her eyes were
following the motion of her hand

  if i had only known he breathed

  i almost told you-that night on the
boat when i gave you the papers-at
the door of my stateroom she said
i dont know what came over me that
night it was all i could do to keep my
secret

  look up a minute what color are
they asked waite

  she raised her eyes and what she
saw in his male her drop them again
what color are-what she asked
faintly

  sometimes they seem blue and some-
times gray and sometimes they are like
pansies which is their real color 
now that we can be-friends again i
have to now i have to esther

  her reply seemed quite irrelevant
i like you a lot better without those
horrid whiskers she said

  a moment or two later the chief
opened the door and stood on the
threshold for just one second he
scanned them through his spectacles
then smiling to himself he turned
went out again and closed the door
softly they neither saw nor heard
him

   a tale of overland red in the lusty days of free range and unfenced
activities romance transports him from middle age to the anticipation of
youth and as he sleeps in the saddle and dreams there comes to him on
the swift and silent wings of memory the unforgetable adventure of bonitas
christmas

in his younger days overland red
was a bit quicker on the trigger
and a bit slower to condemn ques-
tionable exploits than in later
years when experience had mellowed
him and time had broadened him both
in body and vision tingeing his curly
red hair with a few silvery reminders
of erstwhile toil and stress in the out-
lands

  even after he had ceased to pack
two guns and ride the high trails many
said he was still a fighter but his close
friends knew him for a man of peace
and illimitable pleasantry his once
keen almost acrid wit had softened to
a broad and benevolent humor and
as often as hot when riding to town
from the moonstone rancho he chose
the shady side of the trail and rode
slowly living over again the vivid ro-
mance of his youth dreaming reincar-
nated daydreams his physical being
subconsciously alert but his mental vi-
sion lost in far reaches of hill and
valley canon and mesa

  the chance coyote limned sharply
on the hilltop sky line no longer evoked
that lightning turn of the wrist and
the peremptory whang of his  jack
rabbits leaped away at the clatter of
his ponys feet frequently turning to

sit up and gaze at the placid figure rid-
ing the faint horizon trails and the
misty hills of his earlier meanderings

  overland red had become a well-
to-do and law-abiding citizen free-
handed hearty and a stickler for the
proprieties-as observed on a cattle
ranch he still carried a service-worn
revolver in a shoulder holster and still
wore chaps when riding-habits he
could not overcome despite the times
and the manners the casual observer
would have taken him for a wealthy
cattleman of most ordinary proclivi-
ties never dreaming that the big jo-
vial rider was the once-renowned red
jack summers of the lusty days of free
range and unfenced activities

  romance occasionally tugged at his
heartstrings at such times his keen
blue eyes would twinkle as he reached
for tobacco and papers to roll a ciga-
rette leisurely with one hand and
dream perchance of a southern mesa
sprinkled with an unexpected powder-
ing of snow and of a christmas day
cherished as a vivid spot in the rather
bleak monotony of an arizona winter

  the december breeze was cool and
welcome his pony moved at an easy
running walk that wore down the long
boniti



winding miles to the far-seen valley
red rode with one hand on the fork
of the saddle as comfortably as
though he had been seated in a slowly
moving rocking-chair a rabbit shot
from a clump of grease wood the
horse usually dependable snorted and
reared red swayed to the leap and
grinned then he brushed his hand
across his eyes felt for tobacco and
papers and rolled a cigarette they
entered a notch in the hills the high
avails of moonstone canon shadowed
pony and rider the air grew chill
the wind dying away in the silent
rock-strewn canon no longer stirred
little whiffs of dust at each step of
the horse overland red glanced at
the sky and nodded at its peculiar dun-
gray coloring snow he muttered
yet there had been no snow on the
moonstone for many years

  the pony slowed to a careful walk
the canon cleft narrowed to a strip
of hazy blue overland closed his eyes
that the memory of a past incident
might take clearer outline

  that his horse should turn and plod
up a barren sandy trail to a mesa never
mapped within the confines of califor-
nia did not surprise him it was an
arizona mesa strewn with ragged
tufa and dotted with bunch grass
buttes of extravagant shapes and sizes
reared their wind-worn citadels against
the far horizon the air was no longer
the balmy breath of california but the
keen thin air of the high mesas glanc-
ing down he was not astonished to ob-
serve that he now wore white angora
chaps that his horse was not the big
bay of the moonstone rancho but an
active quick-stepping pinto that tossed
its head as the foam flecks danced in
the sunlit air overlands right hand
went to his hip and touched a quick-
draw holster he smiled ought to
be another he said in his dream and
most casually he glanced at his left
hip from which hung another gun

romance had transported him from
middle age to the anticipation of youth
he was curious to learn whether or
not the adventure which he knew must
follow would keep accurate pace with
his dream memory of it and even as
he slept in the saddle and dreamed-
in the brief few minutes in which his
pony worked cautiously down the rag-
ged canon trail-there came to him on
the swift and silent wings of memory
the unforgetable adventure of bonitas
christmas

  six feet of sinewy endurance a face
lean keen and strong tanned to saddle
color curly red hair clipped close-
vivid against the wide rolling brim of
a new stetson a flaunting dark-blue
neckerchief and dominating all the
glance of clear blue eyes alert and
mirroring a rich vitality-red jack
summers at twenty-two was nothing
if not colorful his poise was the
poise of one never anticipating action
but always ready for it he rode
loosely and easily the pinto cayuse
flashed from side to side as he loped
through the low chaparral of the mesa
silver gleamed on bit and bridle rein
starred conchas twinkled on saddle
and tapaderos tied to the saddle was
a gay-colored serape that swept the
ponys flanks

  the little cow horse swung tirelessly
toward the distant rim of the western
hills sixty miles away lost in the
far horizon the town of perral lay
somewhere in that blue monotony of
haze-blurred ranges sixty miles of
sunlit silence plenty of time for a
man to think uninterruptedly

  overland hung the reins on the sad-
dle horn and reaching back untied
the serape from its fold he drew a
handful of color a vivid silken shawl
of black barred with crimson and gold
he crushed the fabric in his gloved
hand and released it allowing it to
float and flicker bravely in the breeze


the populrr magazine

an end of the floating color brushed
his lips and he smiled a flame of red
ran to his temples even in the empty
expanse he felt ashamed of what he
considered a display of sentiment for
as the shawl had touched his face he
kissed it slowly he rolled the waver-
ing silk in the serape and retired it

  meanwhile the pinto loped steadily
he knew his destination and concen-
trated upon it mile after mile strung
out behind him yet in the unmarked
emptiness the horse seemed to be lop-
ing upon a giant treadmill that turned
slowly beneath his hoofs the hills
were less hazy but appeared to be no
nearer red jack summers drifted
into a speculative soliloquy and talked
-presumably to the pony

  now a fella cant get away from
hisself nohow or mebby from the
other fella whats watchin him day and
night some folks call the other fella
god mebby theyre right for sure
enough the other fella keeps the books
and dont miss nothin he gathered
up the reins and stood in the stirrups
gazing at the far hills and lone-
some land is the last place to ride-
if youre aimin to get away from com-
pny its like a hoss travelin sin-
gle he thinks too much and sometimes
reckons hes gettin tired put him
along with another hoss or two and
hell go lively to the finish theres
sure more inside of a man than he
reckons on and that other fella that
whispers do so or dont do such
sure has a big job on his hands-spe-
cially with me now i had to jump
three different towns for killin-in
straight gun fight-clean  why 
cause the other fella inside of me kep
a-tellin me thered be more killin if
i stayed was i scared of that nope
i reckon not but i sure was scared
of what the other fella could tell me
nights-when i got to thinkin of kill-
in i could a got along without they
sure is somethin runnin things-and

folks only folks is mostly ornery and
not willin to be run now a fella
whats sometimes got to kill to live is
in bad with hisself and here i be
fannin it lively right into perral know-
in i aint got no business there less i
go heeled and keep my gloves off both
hands the folks has took to callin
me red and it aint all cause i got
that kind of hair either but i reckon
ill let them worry-not me

  he sat back against the cantle and
easedhis pony down a sandy slope
the bar-o trail runs in here some-
wheres were makin right good time
sarko

  the pony mechanically lengthened
out to a lope again occupied with his
soliloquy overland failed to notice a
rider who loped along a trail converg-
ing toward his own at the angle
where the trails met he pulled up and
turned the man riding the big black
gelding spurred up and drew along-
side overlands eyes hardened he
was angry with himself for having al-
lowed any rider to approach so close
without having seen him moreover
he knew this rider and the rider knew
him and bonita the velvet-eyed mex-
ican girl of perral knewr them both
overland nodded mornin-stran-
ger

  the others eyes closed to aggressive
slits wrhy mornin buckaroo rid-
in my way

  nope think too much of my hoss
to ride your way but i aim to ride
the same trail

  uh-uh i hear perrals got a new
sheriff

  and you -ridin that way well
now

  sun aint botherin yore eyes any

  nope but sometimes i get care-
less about lettin strangers get close up
but the bar-o trail never worried me
none

  the other grinned yore a good
talker red sos most preachers
bonita



  overland ignored the taunt veiled
by the seemingly innocent remark was
the inference that he said more than
he was willing to back up with action
yet he felt that he had given the bar-o
rider a fair excuse to declare himself
an old hatred for the other burned
up in overlands eyes but the word
preacher had given a twist to his
thoughts he smiled broadly you
said it simms reckon you aint for-
gettin that to-morrows christmas
eh

  same as you thought id fan it
over to town and see some friends i
got friends in perral

  so well you need em-every-
where

  simms jerked his pony back red
jack summers also pulled up the
men faced each other red smiled
go get it ill allow to give you time
to get your gun loose and then ill get
you-and you know it

  simms blinked as red pulled tobacco
and papers from his pocket and rolled
a cigarette-with his right hand this
was an open challenge and an insult
but simms knew his man he reined
round and spurred his horse

  hey simmy to-morrows christ-
mas whats your hurry

  reds voice was jovial his face se-
rene and thats the answer he said
as the bar-o rider swung his quirt
he allows to get me some day-and
he gets a lovely chance right here but
he goes and gets mad-which is plumb
wrong for a gunman and now hes
takin it out on that hoss of his funny
how some folks got to get mad afore
they can kill

  the bar-o rider glanced back over-
land made no attempt to overtake him
but rode at an easy lope until simms
pony was a dancing dot on the horizon

that simms would be first to greet
bonita troubled red not a bit like
takin a chaser afore the drink he
told his pony simmy is the chaser
rp

this trip-and the real thing which is
me comes later

  as the hills grew bolder red no-
ticed that the northern sky was over-
cast-yellowish-gray where it had been
clear blue he nodded to himself and
urged his pony

  noon found him munching cold meat
and bread the horse unsaddled and
dragging a rope nibbled at the bunch
grass red determined to give his
horse every chance there was a new
sheriff in perral and red had yet to
learn just what kind of man the new
sheriff was

  the sun burned down to the west-
ern hills the pony quickened its
stride as the town loomed through the
afterglow of sunset a turn in the
road and red saw simms horse tied
to the hitching rail of the shell-out
saloon he rode past glancing at the
swing doors at the livery stable he
dismounted and fed and watered his
pony himself then he left him sad-
dled and bridled clinked across the
street and entered the sheriffs office
breezily to-morrow would be christ-
mas day red earnestly desired to
keep the peace that he might fully enjoy
the society of the velvet-eyed bonita
there would be feasting and dancing
then he wished to ask a momentous
question of the girl and despite his
fondness for excitement he did not
wish to celebrate his proposal with un-
necessary vehemence christmas aint
the fourth of july nohow he told
himself

  the sheriff greeted him stepped to
a back room and brought out a bottle
and glasses overland grinned evi-
dently this new sheriff was a man of
sense and sympathy

  well just one-for luck said
overland tipping his glass and say
sheriff whats the prospects of my
strollin around this here sky town
without havin trouble reckon you
know how things set here with me


the popular magazine

  glad you spoke of it summers

  i reckon simms has been talkin
yes he rode in a few hours back
tells me i could expect you hes talk-
in now over to the shell out hes
mentionin your name frequent
uh-uh well im right sorry
so am i to-morrows christmas
what do you say to leavin your guns
with me

 overland pondered finally he
spoke nope sheriff it cant be did
cause why well folks would say i
was dodgin chances but ill hang em
up with you if youll get simmy to do
likewise

  simms is drunk if you say the
word ill jug him

  nope i dont say her i come
peaceful and not wantin trouble but
i aint hidin out

  the sheriff a much older man than
red smiled knowingly he appre-
ciated the others attitude knew him
for a man of absolute courage and
moreover the name of bonita min-
gled with the town gossip of both
simms and red summers influenced
the sheriff to use all the tact he pos-
sessed in keeping the men separated
he knew that red had enemies in town
and few friends he surmised that in
the event of a quarrel simms would
have many partisans eager for an ex-
cuse to kill the two-gun man he knew
also that red summers would exact a
heavy toll before he was finally sub-
dued or killed the dance tunes up
at eight he said suddenly

  all right sheriff ill sure turn
these here over to you afore i hit the
floor and he touched his holsters
ill be ramblin down to the shell out
nope thanks but i aint drinkin--
this journey

  sheriff scott watched the young man
swing down the road and enter the sa-
loon then scott rose and stepping
out locked the door of his office he
hesitated glancing up and down the

street then  he trudged toward the
western end of the town where the
mexican adobes lay dotted against the
hillside

  he entered bonitas home and asked
to see her she came radiant smil-
ing but her smile faded as she recog-
nized the sheriff scott toying with
his sombrero spoke to her in mexican
it required all the resources of his lim-
ited vocabulary to explain the situa-
tion to her-and especially his respon-
sibility bonita naturally flattered by
his appeal was at first inclined to make
light of the matter but the sturdy sin-
cerity of the sheriff finally won her to
consider his plan watching her eyes
he launched his final argument if
they mix senorita theyll sure be two
funerals-puttin it mild and you
can save em both-and he laughed
-and take your choice later i reckon
a live husband is better than a dead
lover any time or place mebby theyll
be a dance over to the encinetas to-
morrow

  bonita laughed si my cousin
he make the grand baile i go

  scott wiped his forehead the ses-
sion had been warm from his side of
it he sighed heavily as he rose with
bonita absent at the encinetas rancho
christmas in perral might still be a
day of unruffled gayety and bonitas
most natural coquetry led her to hasten
that she might arrive at her cousins
rancho in time for the christmas jol-
lity

 red jack summers had sense
enough to know that he acted rashly
in entering the shell-out saloon but
that peculiar pride of the man who
packs two guns would not let him do
otherwise in arizona in those days
one gun was as much a part of a
mans habiliments as his hat two
guns however were a silent and open
challenge they advertised the gun-
man even as the battered ears adver-
tise the pugilist
bonita



 simms was at the bar when red
entered it is an almost invariable rule
that a contemplated challenge between
men of the outlands is preceded by an
invitation to drink red being the
later arrival was invited by simms to
have something he declined the bot-
tle pushed toward him but accepted a
cigar the crowd in the room were
most naturally surprised the accept-
ance of a cigaf under the circumstances
was significant the gunman was not
taking any chances simms argued
that red was afraid to drink this
idea grew as he consumed more liquor
overland chatted with the townsmen
and ranchers and ignored simms who
stuck close to the bar presently the
bar-o man stepped up to red whose
back was turned and touched his
shoulder red turned slowly smiling
simms stiffened want to sell that
cayuse of yourn he queried

  nope i got use for him

  oh all right i was lookin for a
plumb gentle hoss to give to a lady-
one what is old and safe

  uh-uh well thats the kind of
a lady to give a hoss to simmy hed
sure git used right

  the bartender from his vantage
ground of safety laughed several
spectators wanted to laugh but re-
frained simms scowled you kin
talk better with your mouth than you
kin with yore hands hombre

  overland ignored the animus of this
arid impeachment he turned and
asked the assembled company to name
their individual tastes their tastes
were peculiarly similar again red
took a cigar then with deliberate
movement he unbuckled his guns and
passed them over the bar i come
peaceful he said and turning strode
from the saloon

  hes shore tied simmys hands
said a lounger to a companion

  which is luck for simms was the
retort

  red strolled down the street entered
the stable and secured his gift for
bonita he passed on down to the
end of the town and stopped at an
adobe the door was opened by a
plump mexican woman who greeted
him cordially he entered and glanced
round evidently bonita was attiring
herself for the dance she was not
there to welcome him the mexican
woman made coffee and tortillas red
maintained a questioning silence as he
ate then he rolled a cigarette and
gave his parcel to the senora for
bonita he said

  si senor bonita she mak pasear
le tiempo to zat-what you say-enci-
netas rancho beeg dance senor she
ees com back poco tiempo-manana
si

  so muchas gracias senora i
reckon ill fan it over that way simms
and me was expectin to go-but i
dont see him around here

  he ess come-and he go

  oh so he sized up the layout
well adios senora see you later
red departed his genial smile was
gone his stride quickened as he
neared the shell out pushing through
the swing doors he asked for his guns
simms half drunk laughed gettin
his nerve back he remarked

  red heard and the bronze of his
cheeks deepened he buckled on his
guns and -walked up to simms those
leaning along the bar moved away
gently im givin you one more
chanct simmy he said and turning
his back square on the other marched
out

  the trail to the encinetas rancho
lay north of the town along the foot-
hills red rode at a lope occasionally
disciplining the active pinto who
seemed disposed to swing toward the
home trail a star pricked the velvet
wall of the night-then another and
another a faint breeze out of the
north fluttered the scarf at reds


the popular magazine

throat he knew that bonitas cousin
lived at the encinetas and the thought
did not please him the cousin was a
lithe handsome mexican known as a
good rider and a man of courage the
encinetas rancho was a well-to-do
homestead aside from the horse he
rode and the guns he packed red pos-
sessed nothing save a reputation his
reputatien varied as an earning power
according to the peace or stress of the
times and his habitat he had often
pictured bonita as the angel of a peace-
ful existence wherein figured a home-
stead and cattle of his own he be-
lieved that with her as his woman his
days of wandering would cease yet
when free from her presence her vi-
vacity and dusky beauty he had mis-
givings he was yet too young to
thoroughly know himself-a veritable
ulysses of the outlands seeking ad-
venture and excitement as a subcon-
scious outlet for his vigorous vitality
and his love for the romance which he
lived yet knew it not

  such thoughts as these occupied him
as he rode the breeze increased to a
low-voiced wind that spun stray clumps
of tumbleweed across his trail the
air grew chill-indeed too chill for the
season slowly the light of the stars
dimmed as a yellowish haze blanketed
the north a cold keen flake settled
on his cheek he brushed it away
gazing at the sky again he felt the
sting of a snowflake and another and
another a mile farther and he shook
a tiny rift of snow from a crease in
his gauntlet around and about him
the earth grew gray and then blank
white

  suddenly he reined up and glanced
back he could see nothing but his
horse sniffed the thin air and rolled a
startled eye from behind him came
the muffled pound of a running horse
he drew his pony across the trail and
waited gazing back into the night
he fumbled with his gloves when the

dim outline of a raider appeared red
was barehanded even as the running
horse swerved and passed him he
knew that it was simms although the
other bent low in the saddle heading
into the storm like a running moose
looking neither to the right nor left

  but he sure seen me said red
and hes sure aimin to kill that good
hoss of hisn

  that simms had passed him did not
bother red in the least but the fact
that he had ignored him in passing
wrought upon his slow-burning hatred
for the other he drew on his gaunt-
lets and spoke to his horse looks
like i got to do it he murmured
and to-morrow is christmas

  the idea of turning back never oc-
curred to him he felt so absolutely
sure that bonita was his for the ask-
ing that simms seemed rather more of
a joke than otherwise he was filled
with that perilous optimism of men of
his type masterful courageous to a
fault and buoyed up by the natural
egoism of abundant health

  through the glimmer of snow came
the slow sun he knew that he must
be close to the encinetas

  against the hills in an arroyo stood
the ranch buildings strange in their
blanket of white even as red shook
off the numbness of the nights ride
he beheld two figures coming toward
him he reined up it was simms
and the girl reds face went white
and then flamed huddled on her
pony bonita rode close to simms as
they neared the solitary horseman she
put her hand on simms arm he
turned to her and laughed jerking his
thumb toward red

  like a statue red sat his horse gaz-
ing at them they passed him neither
glancing his way he reined his horse
toward the rancho rode up and dis-
mounted despite the bitterness in his
heart he had a thought for the pony
which he fed and watered then he

knocked at the door and was admitted
by bonitas cousin

  the dance was over wickcr-cov-
ered wine jugs littered the room here
lay a sombrero and here a quirt or
gun the cousin greeted him unstead-
ily gestured toward the table and
throwing out his hands as though to
explain his inability to entertain sham-
bled to a bedroom red surveyed the
premises thoughtfully nodded and
helped himself to wine

  simms was asleep in the adobe in
perrai when red returned to that town
it was the day after christmas the
streets were deserted puddles of
melted snow lay in the hollows of the
road the air was keen with the tang
of the northern hills tying his horse
at the shell out red marched up the
street as he passed the sheriffs of-
fice the sheriff nodded from the win-
dow rose and came out goin back
home he asked pleasantly

  yep but i got some business here
first

  theyre married said the sheriff

  red nodded the sheriff scratched
his head as the other passed on down
the street i reckon he dont kill a
married man he muttered

  bonita saw red coming and she
awakened simms who sat up and ran
his fingers through his rumpled hair
she gestured toward a back room but
simms shook his head its got to
come-and i got to see it through he
said reaching for his gun and jerking
it from the holster lemme do the
talkin

  the girl clung to him he shook
her off and strode to the door as red
knocked

  mornin folks said red genially
i heard the glad news and i comes
to congratulate the lady

  simms gazed with blurred eyes at
the rugged form before him got a
present said red and thrusting

simms aside he entered the room the
senora standing in the bedroom door-
way began to chatter in mexican red
waved her a greeting and asked for
his parcel she brought it timidly
for you said red and he untied the
package and presented the gay silken
shawl to bonita and heres hopin
youll have all the good luck to spare
then he turned to simms h om-
bre i could a killed you twict and 
got away with it easy folks here
knows you give me plenty excuse but

somethin-

  bonita to the surprise of those pres-
ent suddenly buried her face in her
hands and sobbed

  cheer up lady it might be worse

i was mistook-thats all

  and he turned and passed through
the low doorway the girl ran to the
door jack jackshe called but
he strode on head up and eyes fixed
on the east

  she turned on simms you say to
me he was drunk-in thees perral-dat

he don come-

  thats all right bonita i got you

  as overland red reached for the
reins of his pony a mist blurred his
eyes slowly the pony faded and he
was facing the little country post office
of moonstone av thin film of snow
lay on the ground the postmaster
glancing up came to the door
howdy mr summers got a skid
of mail for you what do you know
about snow in this country

  overland grinned thought i felt
a change in the canon first snow i
ever seen this far down the hills

 the postmaster nodded as red
shook the snow from his gloves and
swung off his horse a squat figure
wrapped in a faded serape passed him
and entered the post office the post-
master followed her in overland sat
gazing at the doorway when the
woman came out he noticed that artrnnd


the cpopular magazine

her thick neck was twisted the faded
strands of a once brilliant scarlet-and-
black shawl he stiffened and brushed
his hand across his eyes then he dis-
mounted and swung into the post office
a bulk of letters and parcels occupied
his attention as he sorted and arranged
them presently he glanced up who
was the chola woman what just left
her oh thats the wife of the

freest-handed gents a-going i guess

that ole chola dame aint starving
shes as big as a box car just rolling
in fat-and that homely

  that what

 er-homely didnt you see-

  never mind that and lemme tell
you somethin dont get to judgin
folks by what you see outside what
folks is is sometimes a long ride from
what they was and just to make it
interestin and christmaslike put up
pound for pound another order of
stuff like i said-and charge it to your-
self

  for them

  for them itll do you good it
done me good already and lemme tell

ole days but if you want to do busi-
ness with the moonstone rancho right
regular dont go to speakin careless
about anything wearin skirts sabe

to think that the old marster takes any
notice of us humans a little bit id say

its bad luck

by h c witwer
author of pretty soft   once too often  etc

any time you dump over the salt you want to make that a perfect day you
want to get to the office in time have both ears wide open when the boss calls
pass op the pinochle tourney at the corner ale parlor and stay in with the wife

say did you ever see a guy in
a restaurant stop packin in the
eats for a minute look around
like he was figurin on runnin
out on the waiter and then flip some-
thin over his left shoulder

  know what he was doin he was
hurlin a little salt over his south arm
because hed just spilled some of it on
the tablecloth

  what dye mean hes nutty  hes
caref ul thats all

  listen any time you dump over
the salt you want to make that a per-
fect day you want to get to the office
on time have both ears wide open when
the boss calls pass up the pinochle
tourney at the corner ale parlor and
stay in with the wife you know ever
since cain and abel got in that melee
over a dame or the box score or what-
ever it was-spillin salt has been bad
luck it means before the day is over
somebody is goin to speak harshly to
you

  ill lay seven to ten right now thats
what started the fracas in europe one
of them king guys probably knocked
over the salt shaker while he was tryin
to reach across the table in front of
his wife for the mustard-and zowie
theyre off

  i aint exactly what you could call
superstitious of course i know that
findin a pin is good luck and laughin
in a graveyard is bad cornin back for

 somethin you forgot is disappointment
 and an itchin hands a sign of money
 i believe in them things like everybody
 else does because i never seen none of
 them signs fail know what i mean 
 theyre right in there hittin one thou-
 sand in the old sure-thing league all
 day long and then theres a few more
 like openin an umbrella in the house
 gettin out of bed on the left side
 laughin before breakfast and puttin
 on the left shoe first you can always
 figure that them things means bad luck
 is cornin to spend the week-end with
 you

   but as i say i aint superstitious

know what i mean i dont believe
in dreams or nothin like that-unless
i dream of fire and of course that
means hasty news or if i dream of
bein bit by a snake its a cinch some
friend is goin to stick one over on me
-and theres a few others but you
know theyre the real thing-none of
that superstition stuff get me 

   i been lookin after box fighters for
 a long time-theres only one guy i
 know thats been in the game any
 longer and hes the bird im goin to
 tell you about i think he was in
 davids corner when the boy knocked
 out that big bruiser goliath if you
 get this guy when hes right and ask
 him hell admit it when i knew him
 though he was a fighter and a good
 one at that if he hadnt been i wouldnt


the tpopulacr magazine

have known him i handled him for
about a year and durin that time i
got the full course on this superstition
thing

  he was old steve h superstition
himself that guy was every little
thing that happened had a special
meanin to him yes and if nothin hap-
pened that meant somethin too you
couldnt stop this guy when it come to
believin in signs he knew em all and
he lived by em of course he was just
a poor ignorant simp because every-
body knows theres nothin to that stuff
unless like now laughin in a graveyard
and whistlin in a theater which of
course is bad luck but i never fell
for this superstition thing myself

  im goin to call this fellow kid
worth because hes still around the
corners here and whats the use of
knockin  anyhow a name dont mean
nothin unless it happens to have thir-
teen letters in it and thats bad-

but to get back to this superstition
thing i ran across the kid out in
denver i wont tell you what year
it was because as long as i can hide
my age whats the use of me makin
you think i was on hand at the battle
of gettysburg now the kid is dif-
ferent he likes to seemold hesthe
funniest guy i ever met hed sooner
be called pop than handsome and when
people ask him is it true washington
carried a cane and does he remember
in which hand he throws out his chest
like a department-store carriage caller

  the day i met him we fought a one-
round quarrel in our citizens clothes
and on the main promenade of denver
it was stopped by the police after i
had outpointed him a mile on the
level when the traffic cop run up i
had the kid holdin on and lookin
around for a referee so he could claim
a foul and have the thing ended

  the brawl started like this im
walkin down the street in one of them
rainstorms - that make you think the

angels is stagin a swimmin tourney
and somebody has ripped the plumbin
out of the sky for a joke the water
is cornin down in seventy-gallon lots
and theres a wind blowin that makes
it some trick to keep on your feet im
there with an umbrella and im try in
to stop it from becomin a cane as the
breeze is twistin the cloth away from
the framework im gettin the breaks
and holdin it together for about three
blocks when i see a guy come through
the doors of a restaurant like hes goin
for a doctor he was a good speedy
guy but the waiter probably thought
he was holdin back because he sprinted
up behind him and drop-kicked him
into the gutter

  i walk over to the victim and help
pull him to his feet gettin practically
no help from him he was short and
chunky and looked more like a
drowned rat than anything else

  what was that guy tryin for-a
field goal i asks him noddin back
to the restaurant

  he looks at me and says down in
his shoes somewheres speakin confi-
dential to himself

  i never seen it fail

  never seen wrhat fail i inquires
instead of answerin me he takes a
flash at the sky and remarks

  i knew it would happen

  that makes you win your bet then
dont it i says thinkin ill fall right
in with him and be as nutty as he is

  then he seems to realize he aint
alone he looks me over very careful
like he was goin to buy me or some-
thin and then he edges in under the
umbrella

  i guess you think im crazy he
begins winnin his guess but you
look like a regular guy so ill give you
the works dye know why i got eased
out of that joint just now i spilled
some salt

  did you spill it all i says

  wait a minute he interrupts
its	luck



there aint no laughs in this you
know what spillin salt means dont
you

  i never been in that beanery my-
self i says but-

  i see he butts in again you
dont know nothin that is nothin
about the different signs its probably
a good thing you met me at that when-
ever you accidentally spill salt it means
youre goin to have a fight

  what kind of a joint is that i
says lookin back at the restaurant

who-

  will you let me tell this he breaks

in

  shoot i tells him let me have
it but lets get away from the wet
get under no more than half of this
umbrella and ill take you to my hotel
i got some old scenery up there that
might fit you in places or would you
like to go back and finish that lovers
quarrel you and that waiter had 
no he says cornin in out of the
rain and shakin the water off his coat
no-i dont want no part of that
waiter he aint to blame anyhow
he couldnt help doin what he did i
started it by spillin that salt

  what do they do to you in there
i asks him if you tip over the sugar
-shoot you

  nope he jcome back as serious as
a life-insurance doctor sugar dont
mean nothin but salt does any time
you spill salt youre goin to have a
fight unless-he stops right in the rain
and points his finger at me-unless you
throw some over your left shoulder
right away

  suppose i asks him suppose in-
stead of spillin salt you drop a little
beef stew on the floor by mistake dye
let some of that go over your left shoul-
der too

  you better let me tell you this he
says itll do you a lot of good im
in that joint eatin a steak see well
a swell-lookin dame breezes in and

  draws a position right across from me
honest she was a knock-out and nat-
urally im gettin an eyeful im puttin
some salt on the meat just as i turn
around and instead of hittin the plate
i let a few grains go on the floor you
can figure how i felt when i seen that
i knew right away im goin to get into
some kind of a jam before the meal is
over of course the only thing to do
then was to throw some salt over my
left shoulder to stop the cornin mix-up
so i pick up the little trick bottle they
got this stuff in and shake it over my
left shoulder just as thewaiter is passin
the table he was a tramp at duckin
and some f it hit him in the eye
dye mean to tell me i says that
guy thro wed you out on ypur ear just
because a littlesalt hit him

  well you see he explains when
the salt hit him it was in the shaker i
had got a little butter on my thumb and
the thing slipped this bottle was
heavy and when it took him in the eye
he went down and for a minute he was
as cold as a winter mornin when he
comes to life he makes a rally and-
well you saw where i finished

  im still laughin at this when we turn
a corner and come to a store with a
big awnin in front of it and theres a
lot of citizens standin there out of the
rain the kid grabs my arm and stops
me just as were goin past

  put that umbrella down he says
dont you know you cant go under
an awnin with an umbrella up

  why not i asks him

  ill bet your first name is stupid
he says and i know why they called
you that too dont you know that
raisin an umbrella under an awnin is
a certain sign of disappointment
oh lay off that stuff i comes
back gettin sore your salt story was
all right but the umbrella thing is more
than i can take come on 

  with that i grab him by the collar
and shove him along under the awnin


the popular magazine

he makes a wild grab for the catch oil
the umbrella sos he can lower the
thing and misses it but he dont miss
me i got it on the nose and went
back on my heels that was enough
for me-to think that this guy would
slam me after i rescued him so with-
out waitin for him to figure out any-
thing else that was bad luck i crossed
my right on his chin

  i guess the waiter and him must have
belonged to the same lodge at that be-
cause he let the biscuit shooter bounce
him without a come-back but writh me
its different he puts his head down
and comes in with both hands i drop
the umbrella and in a minute we were
slammin each other to a fare-you-well
the bunch that was standin under the
awnin out of the rain lost interest in
the weather and crowded around to
watch the battle the kids defense
was about like belgiums and in a
couple of minutes i was hittin him
every place that showed and it looked
like i would make him quit in a round
i uppercut him and he goes down on
his knees and then somebody that prob-
ably was bettin he would stay the limit
runs for a cop when the gendarme
comes up the kid is takin a long count
and a guy in back of him is callin him
a yellow dog in one breath and pleadin
with him to get up and mix it in the
next i heard afterward he lost a buck
on the kid

  the cop looks us over and decides to
take us both to the cooler for stagin
a mill without a license and in another
few minutes were in one of them little
trick jitney patrols on our merry way
to what looks like six months hard
indoor trainin

  the kid is siftin away up in front
on the wagon im next to him and
theres the cop on the end we aint
got even a prospect of gettin away
while im thinkin up some new jokes
to tell the sergeant sos i can get to a
telephone and try for some bail when

  this joy ride winds up the kid jumps
up all of a sudden dives past me and
over the cops legs this here constable
knew more than what was the capital
of the united states because without
even leavin his seat he winds up and
lets his club go at the kid he put a
lot of stuff on that slice of wood and
i never seen no better control in my
life-he was certainly in mid-season
form the club takes the kid on the
back as he straightens up and down
he goes again it was the third time
he had taken a dive that mornin he
reminded me of a seal

  the cop reaches over and picks the
kid up

  i telephoned in to the sergeant he
remarks slammin him into the seat
that im bringin down two guys
thats how many im goin to have
when i get there do you make me 
if you or this other tramp try any more
get-aways ill bend a gun over your
bean

  i eased back farther in my seat

  old pal i says to the cop i aint
a quitter no matter what this guy
does you can count on me to stick to
the party to the last bell

  the kid looks up and snarls at the
cop

  take your hands off me will you
i aint tryin to leave iseen a pin on
the floor of the wagon and i picked it
up thats the first good luck i had
in a week and i aint goin to let it get
away from me

  what dye mean good luck says
the cop

  the kid looks at me as much as to
say get this poor ignorant boob

  why you poor simp  he sneers at
the cop listen see a pin and pick
it up and all that day youll have good
luck 

  that was too much for me

  ha ha i hollers heres the
next verse if you spill salt dont stop
to cry but pop the waiter in the eye
its	luck



  what are you guys  the cop wants
to know nutty

  you may think its funny says the
kid siftin back in his seat and turnin
to me but if you hadnt put that um-
brella up under the awnin we wouldnt
be in this jam

  well were in it all right i an-
swers as the wagon draws up outside
the local bastile and i hope that pin
you found is goin good to-day because
if thats good luck were goin to need
it

  when weget inside the copper leads
us through four halls six rooms and
down a couple of stairways

  where are we goin now captain
i asks the cop as he keeps on weavin
through this mystic maze and draggin
us after him

  to see the sergeant he says

  has he got much of a start on us
pipes the kid puffin up another stair-
way

  you better save that comedy for
the warden says the cop i dont
think youll be so noisy after a few
weeks in the coop

  i dont see no cells here the kid
whispers to me

  they dont need none i says be-
cause once you get inside here you
might as well have drawed life from
the judge if a pitcher had the twists
and curves this place has the club
owners would be fightin for him in the
streets ill bet the painters that fixed
this joint up when it was built is still
wanderin around here lookin for an
out

  further discussion as we say at the
hotel was cut off by us bein finally
dragged in before friend sergeant this
guy was sittin at a desk that looked
more like an altar than anything else
there was a candle at each end with
a green globe over it and a plate of
flowers in the middle the sergeant
was there with a foot or so of hair on
his chin instead of his head and ill

bet he was breakin up kids crap games
at the inauguration of washington he
looks at us while the cop leans over
the trick desk and ruins our reputations
and from the sergeants face that cop-
per must have claimed we burned the
orphan asylum finally he motions for
me to step to the rail

  slip me that pin i whispers to the
kid it may get us off with ten years
it wont do you no good he whis-
pers back shakin his head because
i found it you got to find your own
pin

  but i cant go lookin for one now
i shot in his ear while the sergeant is
rappin for me to come hither as they

say hurry up and-

  you dont never want to look for
one he comes back you got to find
it accidental or its no good

  i would have slammed him then and
there but thats what they had pinched
us for so i laid off and stepped up
before the sergeant before he could
get set i had cut loose with the first
page of a plea that would have took
the boys out of the trenches as henry
ford says i guess it was because we
had the pin in the party because after
he had bawled us both out the sergeant
turns us loose the cop looked like
his flat had just burned up i never
seen anybody so sore on another guy
for bein a success as that copper was
on me

  the pin is still workin good and we
luck our way back through them rooms
and halls and pretty soon were outside
in the rain again then i find out i
have left the umbrella leanin up against
the sergeants throne

  wait a minute i tells the kid
i be right back

  he grabs me by the shoulders
  where are you goin  he says

  i left the umbrella in there i an-
swers and im goin back to get it
ill bet the sergeant and his trained cop
are matchin pennies for it now


the cpocpular magazine

  youre goin back yells the kid
glarin at me whats the matter with
you dont you know that to go back
after you started from a place is sure
disappointment 

  say look here friend i says i
dont want to go to the mat with you
no more to-day but if you dont stop

spoilin my afternoon i-

  i dont know how you been gettin
by since they dropped you from school
he butts in like hes disgusted with
me for you are about the most stupid
guy i ever saw you seen what took
place when i spilled that salt you no-
ticed what happened when you put that
umbrella up under the awnin and you
watched that pin i found keep us from
bein railroaded to jail yet you want
to go back after that umbrella when
you know it means well have more
bad luck

  well whats the matter with your
pin now i says tryin to humor him
whats the matter with that has

it laid down on you or-

never mind about the pin he shuts
me off thats got to lastus all day
fine i comes back gimme it
and ill hold it in my hand while im
askin for the umbrella

  he dont say nothin for a minute
but stands there frownin in the rain
then he says kinda slow and doubtful
like hes givin himself the worst of it
it might work at that go ahead take
a chance but be careful and dont pass
between two people on the way in or
youll jinx us for fair

  say he passed over that pin like
it was set with four-carat diamonds

  i got the umbrella all right and when
i come out again the kid is standin
with his eyes shut mumblin to him-
self and people are bumpin into him
and apologizing thinkin him blind

  whats the matter now i asks
him when he dont pay no attention to
me have you got somethin in your
eye

  he shakes his head quick for me to

keep quiet seein his lips movin i
lean over and hear ninety-six nine-
ty-seven ninety-eight ninety-nine a
hundred

  then he opens his eyes

  i just seen a load of hay pass while
you was in there he explains so of
course i had to count a hundred and
make a wish

  what did you wish i says that
you wasnt crazy 

  i wished i could get a fight in this
town thats what i wished he says
although i shouldnt have told you
im liable not to get it now

  you wished you could get a fight
i yells what dye mean you wished
you aint got no kick cornin so far
to-day have you  as far as ive seen
thats all about all youve done youre
what they call a glutton for punishment
aint you

  as usual he says you dont get
me at all i might as well tell you
now that im the lightweight champion
of redville north dakota some day
im gonna be lightweight champion of
the world and points north i come
on here to get a fight and my manager
run out on me he got sore because i
wouldnt fight a guy that was the sev-
enth son of a seventh son you know
what a chance you got of beatin them
guys dont you

  i dont blame your manager for
leavin you flat i tells him hes
probably gone to look for some pins
and hes afraid to come back after
he started because its disappointment
now listen to me i i guess that pin
you found is in there tryin at that be-
cause i happen to be a manager there
is just an outside chance that we can
both have some good luck if i get
you a fight will you be ready to box
whoever i sign you with

  if you dont do it on a friday
yes he says i never start nothin
on friday because its bad-
its	luck



  all right i shuts him off come
on up to the hotel and well fix up a
contract

  we dont pass no more awnins on
the way to the hotel and we get there
without meetin any more signs of good
or bad luck i start up to the desk to
register this bird when all of a sudden
he stops dead

  lets get out of here right away
he whispers quick

  heh i says starin at him hes
tremblin like a guy under a cold
shower

  come on will you he goes on
pullin at my sleeve do you want us
to be jinxed for the rest of the week
look at that guy standin back of the
desk

  whats the matter with him i
asks thats the clerk he looks hu-
man to me an-

   hes cross-eyed you boob hisses
the kid if he looks at us were
through

  say this bird was beginnin to get
on my nerves know what i mean 
i grabs him threw him into the ele-
vator and jumps in after him

  sixth floor i yells to the chauffeur
lets go

  and we went

  wthen i get the kid safe in my room
i make him sign a contract callin for
a forty-per-cent cut of his income for
the next twelve months all i got to
do is see that he makes it then i
lock him in and stand outside the door

  ill call for you in a couple of
hours i tells him through the keyhole
im afraid if you go walkin around
pawnee bill will cop you away from
me im goin out and get you a fight
and if i find any pins ill bring em back
and well split em between us

  be sure the point is turned away
from you before you pick them pins
up he yells after me as i get in the
elevator because if they aint it means
a broken friendship

  he was poor eh 

  i had a few dollars in my left shoe
and i took them out sos theyd be ready
to work for me then i got busy i
went out to herman doyles place first
herman had a road house away out on
the edge of the town where about a
dozen fighters were trainin and after
half an hours elocution i get permis-
sion to bring my find out there to work
then i go to the newspapers and give
the kid a record that if he had made
it there would be crowds followin him
in the streets i got one more call to
make and thats on jake mccoy whos
got a stable of hams that start nearly
every night and run second every time
they fight the champion of the lot
had once gone four rounds shadow
boxin with himself and then he saw
one of his own swings in the mirror
forgot himself and took a dive you
know how hard it is to get rid of a
habit the colors of the outfit should
have been yellow

  i picked out the worst one of the
troupe and match him with the kid
we get on in a preliminary bout the
next week and the kid stops this tramp
with a punch the next week we fight
another one and win in three rounds
then we get a star bout with a guy
called the california cyclone

  i found out how he come by that
name in the first round when he jumps
from his chair tears across the ring
and floors the kid with a left hook to
the jaw the kid stayed down so long
i thought he had got stuck to the can-
vas but he got up before the referee
who stuttered reached ten the cy-
clone bounced him twice more before
the bell rang and stopped the massacre
and the crowd was in hysterics with
joy wthen the kid comes to his cor-
ner he motions for me to lean over

  im goin to have trouble with this
guy he says hes lucky hes got
a mole on his right shoulder

  yes i comes back swingin the
iio

the popular magazine

towel over him and hell probably hit
you with it in a minute hes slammed
you with everything now but the bucket
what do you care what hes got 
well stake him to the mole i got a
wart on my nose and you got a hay-
maker in your right hand go on get
mad now and start somethin

  the kid takes a long drink from
the water bottle and shakes his head

  i wish i had seen that mole or
known somethin about it before this
fight he says id have had more
sense than to meet this guy you know
yourself what a mole on your right
 shoulder means and-

   bang goes the bell

   the kid stalls around the ring and
the cyclone starts right in to end the
thing i guess his mole was tryin all
right because in a minute hes got the
kid in a bad way again and rockin
like a ship in distress he took three
wallops at the cyclone and missed him
from here to peoria and after that he
just kept close and hung on until the
crowd run out of things to call him
he just did last out that round and
when he gets in the corner he looked
ready to call it a day while were
workin over him he turns to me and
says

  if you only looked that guy over
before you signed me up but no you
go right ahead and- aha

   he stops all of a sudden elbows me
away and looks at the floor

   gimme that hair he yells

   i look down and sure enough theres
a hair lay in in a crack of the floor
i bend down and pick it up

   is it red hollers the kid

   it was black but i got a quick flash

   it is i says

   he leans back and laughs out of his
battered face

   that settles it he grins this
guy will be soft for me novo i got
him faded and jinxed his mole if you
find a red hair it always means-

  the bell cuts him off and hes in
the middle of the ring waitin for the
cyclone he dont have to wait long
because the cyclone took a runnin
start and just simply threw a right
swing at the kids jaw but the kid
laughs out loud and stabs out with his
left like a bullet takin the other guy
on the chin and sendin him back on
his heels the surprised look on the
cyclones face was funnier than any-
thing you ever seen in the movies he
didnt get no time to figure it out
though because the kid is on top of
him like a tiger shootin out lefts and
rights like they was cornin from a
machine gun the cjdone reels
around the ring tryin to clinch but
you try to throw your arms around a
buzz saw and youll get an idea of what
he was up against the crowd has the
tip-off and theyre on each others feet
screamin for a knock-out they got
their wish when the kid jabs the cy-
clones arms away from his face and
hooks him with his right

  this here cyclone was just cornin
to life when we left the clubhouse

  well we win a half a dozen more
quarrels and then we get an offer to
fight the lightweight champion ten
rounds in new york it was to be our
first start in the big league and it meant
about ten weeks of hard trainin so we
just move up to herman doyles road
house and i hire three or four good
boys to help ready the kid

  the first day he shows up at the
camp hes got a black cat under his
arm which he claims followed him out
from the hotel and which he swears
is a sure sign of good luck the next
day he blows in with a hop-toad two
beetles and a rabbits hind foot cou-
ple of days more he fails to appear at
all and i go all over denver lookin
for him i finally bring up at one
of them high-class junk shops where
they sell you anything from napoleons
nail file to a piece of noahs ark i
its bd luck

ill

hear the kids voice through the door
just as i was goin past

  gimme a dollars worth of them
brazilian lucky beans hes sayin and
i guess you better wrap up that leop-
ards eye too then ill take that thing

you hang around your neck and-

  i hurries inside the store and theres
the kid with about a dozen clerks
around him pushin and shovin each
other aside while he is lookin over all
this what-not as they say when he
sees me he yells

  hey come on out in the back
yard they got a lucky wishin well

here and-

  have you quit the fight game  i
asks him shovin my way through the
clerks

  heh he says why-whats the
matter 

  i was just wonderin i tells him
whether you was figurin on havin that
cat and the beetles and the hop-toad
fight the champion instead of you
what dye mean by runnin out on me
like this i got a lot of guys up at the
camp waitin for you to start trainin
and payin them five bucks a day while

luck  how can this guy beat me when
i got all this stuff try in for me you
take one of these brazilian lucky beans
for instance and put it in your left
ear while youre fightin and nobody

  i seen the clerks hidin their faces
behind their hands like they just
thought of somethin funny but is too
polite to laugh out loud

  well i finally drag him away and
get him out to the camp where the
first thing he does is to fix up a room
with this junk the whole gang out
there is wise to him and one of the
handlers buys a paper of pins and
sprinkles them all over the floor sos

the kid can find them another one
leaves a horseshoe outside his dressin-
room door and a panhandler offers to
show him a nest of four-leaf clovers
for five bucks with all that i keep
him workin hard though and finally
we start for new york

  the first night were on the train the
kid wakes me up about twelve and
when i look over the edge of the berth
there he is all dressed and with his suit
case in his hand

  hurry up and get your clothes on
he whispers we got to get right off
this train

  dont it stop at new york i asks
him sittin up and rubbin my eyes

  dont gimme an argument he
says it may never reach new york

  what dye mean doomed i asks
him reachin for my shirt

ear ill tell you what i mean the
number of the engine is  the con-
ductor is cross-eyed they throwed my
black cat off the baggage car because
they claim he bit somebody a guy is
shavin in the next stateroom and he
breaks a mirror and the left side of my
nose has been itcliin for a half hour
aint that enough 

  plenty i says its a wonder they
let them take this train out still they
got couplin pins on all the cars and
maybe you coirid slip out over the
tender and give the engineer a handful
of brazilian beans and one of them
beetles

  all right he pipes droppin the
curtain of the berth you can take
a chance but not me im goin to get
away from here myself

  i grab my overcoat and put it on over
my pajamas then i swing down from
the berth and run up the aisle after
the kid

and there hes gone to the dinin
car and spilled some salt i tells my-
self and rather than take a chance on

  gimme the two bits boss says the
waiter and if your fren will keep his
hands where they wont do me no harm

  i take the kid out and keep him
where i can see him without a field
glass until we get to new york

  the night of the battle we start
the popular magazine

downtown in an auto and in the back
we got the kids entire layout of
charms theres the leopards eye the
two beetles the hop-toad the muskrats
tooth the rabbits foot the brazilian
lucky beans and another black cat the
kid had picked up on the street he
met a hunchback bootblack at the rail-
road station and hes got him along
too every now and then he turns back
and looks at the menagerie in the back
of the car and says i dont see how
i can lose 

  from the mob outside the clubhouse
it looks like everybody in the state will
be at the ringside and as were fightin
on a percentage it seemed like were
goin to get bean money for a year
im feelin pretty good myself but the
kid looks about as happy as a guy with
a jumpin toothache in front of a closed
drug store i catch him shakin his head
and mutterin to himself as we start
upstairs for the dressin room

  whats the matter now  i asks
him you look like a hired pallbearer
you can stall this guy off for ten rounds
and you got a good chance of bouncin
him you know what that means
did you notice it too he says
what  i asks

  the cops around the outside of the
club he answers you seen them
bulls keepin the crowd back didnt
you they was six on one side and
seven on the other i counted em
well what of it i says thats
enough aint it

  what of it he hollers stoppin
dead on the stairs seven and six is
thirteen aint it  thats fine stuff to
run into right off the reel aint it ill
bet itll be my luck to draw a cross-eyed
referee

  well you got all your charms and
stuff with you what dye care  i
comes back if you got them good-
luck things all ribbed up and readied
and they dont lay down on you you
aint got nothin to worry about have

you let them pull a cross-eyed ref-
eree as long as he can count he can
have chicken pox and it wont bother
me

  why should it bother you  he says
youre goin to be outside the ring
aint you ill bet if he does do any
countin hell be standin over me when
he starts i wouldnt be surprised at
nothin the way theyre breakin for me
now

  i finally force him upstairs to the
dressin room and get him inside
theres another room right next to it
and in a few minutes we hear somebody
movin around in there whoever it
was was feelin pretty good because
he starts to whistle a lively tune

  the kid is gettin into his ring togs
and at the very first note he stops short
and drops the bandages on the floor

  dye hear that he says to me

  sure i tells him go ahead and
get ready thats only one of the pre-
liminary boys whos goin to fight a
set-up probably and-

  thats got to be stopped right
away snarls the kid the idea of
a guy whistlin in a dressin room he
must be nutty theyll probably be a
fire here to-night after that hey
lay off that mockin-bird thing in
there will you  he yells over the
transom

  the guy on the other side stops for
a minute and then goes on whistlin
a little louder than before we hear
his friends in there laughin

  can you beat that the kid wants
to know slammin his fist down on the
table that tramp in there probably
dont know that whistlin in a dressin
room is the worst thing anybody can
do thatll bring bad luck quicker than
anything stop that whistlin he
breaks off and yells over the transom
again

  the guy in the next room misses a
note long enough to laugh and then he
goes right on where he left off
its bad luck



  are you goin to stand for that
bellows the kid turnin on me that
guy will just about jinx me out of this
fight go in there and choke him will
you 

  aw come on kid i says let
the boy alone get ready-and let him
whistle if he wants to he may have
just got married or turned down by his
girl or somethin we got a date out-
side in a couple-

  the guy next door starts some fancy
notes and opens up with a little more
stuff in his whistle

  hey cut that out shrieks the kid
dancin around and poundin on the
wall

  pull in your ears stupid yells back
the guy on the other side and you
wont hear it

  it was about the first time i ever seen
the kid ravin mad he flings his shoes
on the floor and before anybody can
grab him hes out the door and in the
next room

  go get him quick yells spider
riley one of the handlers hell go
in there and beat that boob up and
well all get in dutch

  i was thinkin the same thing myself
so i jump for the door and dashes for
the next room just as a guy i recog-
nize as one of the club managers comes
runnin up from the noise that come
over the transom youd think it was a
battle royal between wild cats

  are you ready says the manager
the referees been in- the ring for ten
minutes and the crowd is yellin mur-
der what are- hey whats

away wheres the champion 

  heh  he says cornin up why

hes in that room there and-

  good night i yells and shoves in
the door with my shoulders

  the first thing i seen is what looks
like a race riot two guys are standin

head to head in the middle of the room
sluggin each other and six others are
tryin to pull them apart and gettin
the worst of it one of the gladiators
suddenly jumps away and swings his
left from the floor it takes the other
battler over the heart and he went
down so hard i figured hed wind up
in the basement

   i didnt need but one flash to see that
he was two things-out cold and kid
worth

   all right im ready sings out the
champion blowin his nose and startin
for the club manager who looks like

gnat cough

synopsis op opening chapters

     sea rover adventurer marine engineer it was a gift of good fortune when the sea fox was
sighted by thomas harding he had been shipwrecked with jack masters and some of the crew of
the ill-fated marion and they were in a bad plight when the sea fox was discovered it was a
huge submarine cast upon the shore of iceland-a submersible of advanced type and splendid equip-
ment her crew of germans had through some chemical accident been asphyxiated harding and
masters together with their rough and motley companions of the marion bury the german victims
and btgin to experiment on the undersea boat both masters and harding are clever at machinery
and know a lot about navigation between them they get the u-boat in working shape their fellow
castaways enter the plan eagerly and they man the submarine the object is to salvage the sea foxt
offering it to the german government with this purpose in mind they set out for the neutral port
of bergen norway where they hope to open profitable negotiations with the imperial government

la four parts-part two

chapter v

i doubt very much if the original
crew of the sea fox was any bet-
ter than the one that drove her
eastward by night and day without
cessation i strengthened my hold on it
by degrees hammered it into shape with
words-not blows-and drilled it to a
state of automatic perfection i gave
the men individually and collectively
my reason for this telling them that
nothing but accuracy of discipline could
bring our venture to anything like suc-
cess and impressed each man with his
individual responsibility there was but
one case of anything bordering on in-
subordination and that after all was
nothing more than a case of disrespect
for jack we were as usual running
completely light at the time when i

heard a sudden shout and a man ran
from below to the deck through the
grease on his face i could see marks of
conflict as i looked down at him from
the superstructure bridge hot after
-him poured a half dozen men who
swarmed upon him and struck and
pommeled before i could interfere i
jumped down to the deck and thrust
them aside but not quickly enough to
save him from two or three heavy kicks
after he had fallen

  stop what does this mean i
demanded angrily and the mans assail-
ants fell back and respectfully saluted

   beggin your pardon sir replied
one of the men stepping in front of
the others this swab shot his mouth
off when he came off watch about mr
masters were the police committee

this story began in the december th popular
the phantom u-boat



andv were punishin him good and
plenty

  police committee what do you
mean by that i asked somewhat puz-
zled

  well sir the man said when you
and mr masters let us in on this job
and acted so fair with all of us we
elected both you and him officers
then we got together and agreed that
wed crucify any sea lawyer or lubber
that shirked or shot his mouth this
man here-

  that will do i interrupted and
for a moment was thoughtful a blind
man could have seen that the men of
the crew themselves were the most ef-
fective instrument i could have for dis-
cipline and yet to have the crew actu-
ally taking into its own hands all right
of trial and punishment might lead to
rather serious results i helped the
fallen man to his feet while thinking
what i had best say

  men i said im much obliged to
all of you for a loyalty and support
that i hadnt quite expected but i do
think that it would be a lot better if
the police committee was to report its
findings to me before acting on them
how docs that strike you 

  by this time the deck was pretty well
filled with nearly the entire crew i
caught sight of jacks head sticking
up through the hatch and he grinned
and winked cheerfully as if appreciat-
ing my dilemma

  but suppose you decided sir that
whoever we sit on ought to get it
queried the leader

  then i should have the right to say
how he should be punished and your
committee could carry it out

  thats all right sir but mybe
youd not give it to the swab hard
enough objected the spokesman

  hard enough  we cant afford to
have a man thumped and kicked till
he cant work can we  i demanded
were short-handed as it is and if a

man goes to the sick bay it means more
work for the others doesnt it

  the committee scratched its head
and cogitated and there were sundry
nods of approval from other heads of
the crew who clustered in the back-
ground

  then how in the devil are you go-
ing to punish a guy that cuts up nasty
asked another member of the commit-
tee

  thats easy enough i declared
with inspiration well log him after
the committee has reported what he
did and how seriously he has offended
and none but a good-conduct man gets
his full share of what we get out of
it in the end the fines imposed shall
be taken out of the offenders cut and
divided up with the others

  i waited for them to talk it over
and encouraged them to do so it was
almost amusing to see how seriously
they mumbled and whispered and
wagged heads and then they agreed

  how much do you fine bill de-
manded the leader pointing at the first
culprit aboard ship

  nothing he has been punished
enough by your way if mr masters
is satisfied i said

  jacks voice came from the hatch-
way and he climbed out

   oh its all right as far as im con-
cerned he declared bills not a bad
fellow we all get hot sometimes
if id known about this police-com-
mittee business id have fought for
bill 

  i never saw such open-mouthed as-
tonishment as was indicated by the
faces of that crew and particularly by
the man bill who for a moment
gasped fidgeted and then advanced
straight across the intervening space
and stuck a grimy fist with an open
palm toward jack

   mr masters sir he blurted out
i got just what was coming to me-
part of it id like to have jou either
the ppuljr magazine

take my hand or slug me and i dont
care much which it is so long as you
take my hand afterward ive been

a- and i can scarcely repeat all

the choice epithets he applied to him-
self

  jack cut them short by taking his
hand and giving it a good firm clasp

  thats all right bill he said
rather short of words himself its
off the log with me youre all right
youre a good man and im for you
if ever you get a kick coming over
anything i say hereafter you come
straight to me and talk it out were 
both men arent we im no better
than you but ive got to have things
done my way if theyre to be done right
you see that dont you

  bill ruffian that he was almost
blubbered as he took the proffered hand
and turned away he took refuge by
turning to the police committee and
saying you chaps did just right it
was coming to me and ill say this
that if any of you fellows think im
not talking on the dead level let him
watch me from now on mr masters
is white-clean through and through
that goes for mine after this

  my crew forgot discipline and com-
mittees and cheered loudly i had to
permit it and take refuge by a curt
order as i climbed back to the tiny
bridge and jack disappeared like a jack-
in-the-box down the hatch and thus
ended the first and last work the police
committee were ever called upon to do
as far as my knowledge goes although
it was whispered to me that on two or
three other occasions they tried men
so strict became their sense of disci-
pline and their anxiety to support
authority

  the days  passed easily enough in a
rather uneventful round i made it a
rule to dive at least once a day and run
submerged for an hour to thoroughly
accustom the crew to that phase of
our work but as far as heavy weather

was concerned there were days when
there was not sea enough to make the
tiny bridge on the superstructure vary
or roll to a half degree and when the
diesels could work straight through
a fifty-hour stretch piling up power
in the accumulators or secondary bat-
teries we had so thoroughly over-
come all difficulties with the storage
system that it proved flawless and yet
we were in no haste and did not force
the swimmer to speed we passed the
distant coast of iceland in all its bleak
dreariness and were well down toward
the faroe islands before we sighted a
craft of any description and here we
sustained a warning of certain dangers
of carelessness in this wise

  both jack and i and a young fellow
called williams but speedily known as
wires had utilized all our spare
time learning telegraphy williams had
been an amateur telegrapher on land
and had shown such quickness of per-
ception that we had resolved to make
a first-class wireless operator of him
and had relieved him from all other
duty now the submarine wireless in-
stallment on the swimmer was con-
nected with antennae under water but
wires became so fascinated with his
study that being a rather ingenuous
sort of youngster he asked and gained
permission to rig a wireless above the
bridge also for experimental work
from this we proved that we had a
mean range of fully three hundred
miles by checking up against the wire-
less station at iceland and also that
our system was an improvement on
any that we knew inasmuch as we could
receive and probably send with equal
facility while submerged or awash we
could prove the former but evidently
wires was eager to test the latter ques-
tion and did so without asking permis-
sion

  the result was that after we had
passed the faroes he intercepted a mes-
sage one day and promptly cut in with
the phantom u-boflt



who are you  the reply was who
are you  w hereupon wires in a
spirit of hilarity promptly answered
submarine u  and after a time
was asked where are you now

  jubilating over the fact that he had
been able to send a real wireless mes-
sage and take a reply wires proceeded
to say that we were off the coast of
cuba and gave a random longitude and
latitude that was intended to be pal-
pably fictitious but here enters the
freaks of the subconscious mind in-
asmuch as wires in making that ran-
dom guess had no idea that he was
giving what had been our approximate
position  the day previous the figures
of which had clung to his subconscious
memory

  at three oclock in the afternoon the
time i deemed most convenient for my
daily study of wireless i went below
and found wires with the receivers at
his ears and relieved him intending to
throw in the practice short circuit and
work with myself to accustom my ears
to deciphering the sound before i
could effect this my ears apprised me
of the fact that some one was within
reach and i caught slowly and pains-
takingly hammered out as if address-
ing an amateur stop kidding you
say you are off cuba but position given
shows you off faroes how about it

  i jerked the receivers from my ears
and stared at wires who caught in his
mistake promptly turned red and stam-
mered i went after him and he con-
fessed

  i am afraid that for a few minutes
i was so angry that i said several
things to him that were not entirely
necessary winding up with and so
you see williams you put the whole
british fleet  the alert and if we get
overhauled and sunk you are to blame
also you make it about ten times as
hard for us to run into bergen without
attracting attention all through your
confounded stupidity

  he looked so contrite and hurt that
as i replaced the receivers and listened
i had time to think it over the ship
whoever she was continued to repeat
her message with persistency proving
that she hoped to get us to betray our-
selves by further communication i did
not answer and to tell the plain truth
was rather complimenting myself 
the fact that i had progressed this far
with my own studies it struck me
that if i a mature man approaching
young middle age should be so grati-
fied by that knowledge wires being
scarcely more than a boy and aged
about twenty could not be expected to
exercise the caution and judgment of
an older head

  i gave him a kindly talk explaining
the dangers brought about by his care-
lessness and ordered him to stick to
his post for fifteen hours as a penance
and considerably perturbed went on
deck and gave orders for a stricter
watch on the ground that we knew
that we were within wireless touch of
some ship i new that the boy would
not answer any other call and it was
well that he did not because for more
than six straight hours his communi-
cant kept trying to evoke a reply from
him even by going to the point of ridi-
cule and abuse on his reporting this
i that night doubled the watch on the
bridge and jack worked the diesels
overtime to charge our storage to its
full capacity that we might be prepared
for all emergencies we slowed down
to make certain of this barely preserv-
ing headway and it proved well that we
did for just at dawn i was called and
notified that a ship had been sighted
off to the west-southwest

  i had gone to sleep fully dressed and
ran to the bridge there was no doubt
that she was a cruiser and a few min-
utes later we made out that she was
accompanied by at least two destroyers
you may believe me that i knew the
efficiency and alertness of the british

navy too well to take any chances all
that most of those commanders need is
a smell in the morning air to set them
off like hounds on the scent and quite
frequently they bring their game to bag

  i sprang the emergency call and in-
side of very few minutes the bridge
deck was cleared ventilators all closed
and the conning hatch whirling down
into its socket we made a pretty good
record of submerging on that nice morn-
ing and also made our longest run
thus far in full submergence and at
full speed i did not come up until
dusk and then did so very cautiously
while standing with my eyes glued to
the periscope in the control cabin it
is a very uncomfortable thrill until one
gets hardened to it that waiting for the
first peep through a periscope when
danger is around in that respect a
submarine or submersible is helpless
inasmuch as she may come up within
a comparatively short distance of an
enemy that may have by luck or chance
already located her by the telltale swirl
of the waters and be waiting to pounce
upon and override her the swimmer
as is now quite widely known was ar-
mored heavily enough to withstand
even the fire of a  gun but sup-
pose that a heavier gun was in waiting
or that a destroyer with its reenforced
ram should be on watch  i know
some authorities claim that there are
submarines that can submerge to a
depth of sixty feet in sixty seconds
but-im from missouri and know
that we couldnt and i consider that i
have commanded as fine a submarine
as ever went to sea also i knew an-
other thing that with our displace-
ment despite our huge bulk and armor
we could be run down though in that
running both a destroyer and ourselves
might be sent to the bottom for a longer
stay than i cared to make

  on this occasion however the sea
was untenanted when we emerged but
wires had completely robbed us of our

sense of security and from then on
all of us were keyed up to the pitch
perhaps the lad did us a good turn
after all

  it was on a night of brilliant moon
when the lazy swell had been broken
by a nor-norwest wind into whitecaps
which raced yellow-crested across the
seas that tinker had me called for our
first sight of a norwegian beacon we
decided to lay to until morning and
floated quietly on the waves although
off in the distance we could make out
dimly the shapes of warships and the
lights of neutral ships at dawn i sent
for olaf and he took my glasses and
stared long and steadily before giving
an opinion

  bergen he said wasting no words

  then said i if you are still con-
fident that you can take us in and that
this is as good a time as any we shall
dive

  he considered for a minute and
then suggested i think it safest for
us to dive and run in to a point about
five miles up the fiord then lay there
on the bottom until night what time
do we have the moon sir 

  by ten oclock

  i can bring her in to the place where
i think we should go better by moon-
light

  then here goes i said signaling
for all hands to stand by

  we drove and ran by compass slowly
and at such a depth that we could be
certain of safety until long after we
had passed beneath the watching ships
at the harbor ran so quietly that our
screws could scarcely betray us though
some of the lurking watchmen might
have submarine microphones adjusted
to their ears and at last when olaf
gave the signal settled down to rest
and put out our automatic anchors
save for a diminished watch all hands
slept as we lay there on the bottom of
the sea surrounded by cold blue waters
and warmed by electric radiators the
the phantom uoat



ships that twenty fathoms above swept
over us were of no more concern than
the fish that doubtless nosed our steel
hull curiously and swam away when
there was nothing more to learn

chapter vi

  when we emerged at a few minutes
past ten oclock nothing inimical could
be observed through the periscope nor
through the ports of the conning tower
which we left closed inasmuch as we
proposed to make this last and most
dangerous lap of our long journey
awash far away on the edge of the
steep eastern cliffs the yellow rim of
the moon was heralded by a spot of
increasing light bringing all that
towering range into silhouette there
was something very subduing in the
still beauty of the night through which
we must venture

  i called olaf into the conning tower
that like the tower of all submarines
is scarcely commodious for one man
and myself took charge of the innumer-
able recording instruments telegraphs
telltales and emergency levers with
which in case of crisis i could open
the ballast tanks and submerge

  we must come across and under
that high point there sir olaf said
pointing and there was nothing in his
voice to indicate the strain of nervous
tensity that i myself sustained we
must go up that side close to the
shadow of the shore if we dont the
moon will show us up at the next turn-
ing

  i gave the signals and we crept at a
snails pace across the fiord but even
then it appeared to me from the aft
ports that we were kicking up a terrible
fuss and a wake that should betray us
to any chance watcher for an instant
i feared my pilot had lost his head for
he seemed intent on ramming the base
of the cliff before he called a change
of course when he was a stones throw

from their black bases i had no fear
of the water on that side inasmuch
as the charts had proved to me that
the greatest battleship ever built could
safely have sailed at the very base line
but i was fearful that olaf might have
forgotten some of his youthful-knowl-
edge of locality or that we might meet
some boat downward bound i ex-
pressed some of this latter fear to my
pilot who turned toward me and
grinned in the half light

  if we do he said they will be
just as anxious as we are to keep from
being seen unless its a coast-guarder
and they are most likely to be met
higher up

  his confidence was so sure that i
began to enjoy this voyage in the
shadows which when the moon came
higher was of marvelous beauty i did
not know it then but we were traveling
up an estuary that in peace times had
been the delight of those who toured to
the out-of-the-way places on that coast
sometimes we ran straight and true for
miles then came to abrupt bends and
turns where up to the last instant no
way seemed open we would drive at
what appeared to be an impenetrable
wall the very end of the fiord to find
another way opened as if by magic
and a moonlit stretch of serenity
broidered with light and shadow

  times have changed none my pilot
said as if to himself had we come
along here at say two oclock in the
morning the patrol boat might be out
if it happened to be her night of the
week as it is we are alone

  after a considerable journey he sud-
denly turned and said i think we had
best stop sir

  i rang down and waited for his fur-
ther instructions

  it is safe for us to come clear up
now and i will handle her from the
roof bridge

  i doubted the wisdom of this but
i

the popular magazine

could perforce do nothing but trust
to his sagacity i emptied the tanks
and when the long back of the sea
fox with its stripped deck shining and
moist was clear we opened the ports
the conning-tower hatch and rigged the
extra steering wheel and signals on the
roof navigating bridge olaf took the
wheel in his own hands and again we
moved forward but at a higher rate of
speed until we had crossed the fiord
skirted the moonlit bank for a time and
then he signaled for slow speed and
we began to crawl we entered a nar-
row branch of the fiord where the
walls were so close that they seemed
sliding past the sides of the sea fox
while she stood still we twisted
turnedand wriggled our way to come
at last to a tiny bay and there in the
moonlight could be seen a small wharf
and a score of houses-barely more
than stone huts---perched on a narrow
beach at the very foot of high cliffs

  we must have a boat sir said my
pilot relinquishing the wheel

  i did not question but ordered one
of the collapsibles out and waited for
his next wish

  and if you could come along sir
we could pull her in ourselves and-
see what we can find out if there are
any of the old ones left-

  for the first time he was betraying
doubt i slipped my pistol into my
pocket before i entered the boat with
him and privately told jack and tinker
to be prepared for any emergency and
to keep a close lookout for shore sig-
nals

  to all outward appearance the vil-
lage was asleep or deserted when we
landed on the creaking wharf that i
noticed was without lights of any kind
we crossed this ancient structure to
the shale of the beach our feet crash-
ing and clumping and the echoes com-
ing back like musketry from the cliffs
behind olaf advanced unhesitatingly
toward one of the largest houses vis-

ible and thumped vigorously on the
door

  my cousin he explained to me be-
tween thumps and then getting no re-
sponse called a name and a sentence
in his own tongue instantly a voice
answered from inside asked a ques-
tion and i heard olaf pronounce his
own name and some other explanation

  the door came open a crack a man
bearded like a viking held a candle
toward olaf who grinned and sub-
mitted to the scrutiny and then the
door was widely opened the viking
dropped the candle on the table and
he and olaf kissed cheeks in true norse
family fashion from another room
two other men came who greeted
him and these were followed by two
women who shrank back and hesitated
when they saw that olaf was accom-
panied by a stranger they all shook
hands with me in a rather bashful way
one of the women brought out a jug
and some thick glasses and we sat
down being unable to take any part
in the conversation i could but watch
their faces and listen to their exclama-
tions of astonishment and curiosity as
olaf evidently recited his tale fre-
quently they looked at me with glances
of respect so i presume that olaf did
me a little more than justice once
they put out the light lest a stray gleam
shine outward and all went outside
where olaf pointed out the shape of
the sea fox lying dimly visible in the
inlet i observed with satisfaction from
her outline that apparently the entire
crew were on deck and watching the
shore there was further talk and i
was beginning to be a trifle bored by
my position when olaf suddenly turned
to me apd said in english as i
understand it sir you want to get to
bergen 

  yes and without attracting any at-
tention if i can avoid it

  he translated and there was much
more talk
the phantom u-boat



  when asked olaf

  the sooner the better

  all right to-night then he said
but that was sooner than i had ex-
pected i debated mentally whether i
could make all necessary arrangements
before asking at what hour olaf pro-
posed to start there was another long
conversation and then he turned and
outlined a plan

  we can do it in two ways so that
you will not attract attention one
would be to go now and slip down with
the early tide as we did landing at a
place we know from where we could
walk into the town by a country road
the other would be to go boldly in the
daylight on my cousins fish boat but
if you did that it would be better for
you to go dressed as a fisherman

  i had no objections to that and
said so

  my cousins boat has auxiliary
power olaf went on she has a
heavy oil-burning engine very heavy
in fact for a fishing boat he grinned
and gave a solemn wink that i did not
fail to catch my cousin is a very
thrifty man when the fish are not
running he trades up and down the
fiord and gathers pickled fish and coun-
try produce in exchange for the little
stock he buys from bergen merchants
and also-and again he winked that
mirthless wink-some certain other
things that our countrymen like to trade
for

  he stopped and scowled thoughtfully
at the candle and added as far as
our own people go they ask no ques-
tions and when we get to bergen
you might be a deaf-and-dumb man and
i can do the talking my cousin says
that bergen has become so important
since the war broke out that the ger-
man government has a sort of special
consul here with a lot more authority

than they usually have because-

he abruptly stopped and i think asked
permission from his cousin to tell the

reason why and also reassured him
that i would prove worthy of confi-
dence

  because he said again turning to
me as if he had not hesitated there
are many things happening here of
which the norwegian government is
not aware such as supplying certain
german submarines with supplies

  i was inclined to believe that this
was highly in our favor it indicated
that whoever the german consul might
be he was a man of more than ordinary
authority and was kept pretty well in-
formed of the movements of sub-
marines on thkt coast at least he
would therefore be the ideal man with
whom to deal the more i thought
over it the more elated i became i
gave a prompt decision

  that being the case olaf i said
we will go down in the daylight to-
morrow morning as far as i can see
the only authorities we have to fear
are the norwegian ones we would
undoubtedly be classed as a german
war vessel and seized and interned
until the conclusion of the war which
will not satisfy our purpose at all

  quite true sir he assented and
translated what i had said to his
cousin who nodded a vigorous con-
firmation

  a half hour later after some further
planning olaf and i pulled off to the
sea fox in his cousins boat and with
our own in tow i informed jack of
the plans made and the collapsible was
pulled on board that there might be
no chance of our being caught napping
by government patrols it was decided
that the sea fox must submerge and
rest on the bottom until the next mid-
night when if she saw a light displayed
in the house i had visited he was to
know that we had not returned and
should then submerge again until the
midnight following olaf and i then
rowed back to the wharf in his cousins
skiff and stood in the shadows of a


the popular magazine

pile of nested boats until we saw the
sea fox disappear from sight i was
given the spare room in the house and
was now so certain that our adventure
was going well that i slept until aroused
for a homely toilet and a hearty meal
clad in a rather smelly fishermans out-
fit furnished by my host i went with
him down to a heavy but businesslike
boat where i went aboard i found
olaf there whispering mysteriously to
two other men who made up the crew
and who gave me a wide-eyed stare of
inspection and touched their caps

  i had thought the distance much
longer than it was until we dropped
noisily down the fiord propelled by
our engines i did not until then ap-
preciate how difficult had been olafs
task of piloting in the night and how
many curves he had taken to keep in
shadow and avoid chance of detection
nor had i appreciated the natural
beauties of that wonderful mountain-
embraced strip of steel-blue water the
time passed very quickly and long be-
fore i had expected it we churned
round a sweeping curve and came to
the busy docks where at least a score
of boats similar to ours were discharg-
ing fish and produce our arrival at-
tracted no attention whatever beyond
the friendly shouts of those who knew
our skipper and his crew ostensibly
he had come to bergen to lay in some
trading supplies for an upward trip
so we speedily left the boat in charge
of her two men and sauntered up
through the quaint old streets of the
city i could readily believe from what
i saw of the water front and the gen-
eral air of industry that it was the most
important commercial seaport on the
west coast of norway and i under-
stood too from the number of men in
uniform i saw on the streets that the
garrison maintained at the cape forti-
fications had been augmented now that
this country had prepared to defend its
neutrality

  our skipper stopped in a hallway and
held a mumbling talk with olaf who
said my cousin thinks it best that he
does not go with us to the german con-
sulate men who go there are some-
times watched-particularly if the nor-
wegian coast guards are not fond of
them

  good i replied we can find it
you know where to meet him when we
are through with our business

  that point arranged we separated
and olaf and i made inquiries to find
the consulate we found it in the resi-
dential district where a very fine house
surrounded  by exquisite gardens be-
tokened the presence of some german
official of far more importance than one
might have expected in such a post al-
though bergen has between seventy-five
and a hundred thousand inhabitants
from the fiagstaff in front fluttered
the prussian eagles and on entering
we saw that a- portion of the spacious
lower floor had been turned into a
series of offices

  there were at least a dozen attend-
ants clerks and secretaries as well as
two door tenders whose civilian clothes
could not conceal the patent fact that
they were well-drilled and well-set-up
soldiers of the kaisers army they
barred our way and asked if we had
an appointment the fact that i an-
swered them in german however
caused them to show us a little more
consideration i did not ask to see the
consul knowing that to do so would
probably delay us all i wished was
to get past the door we were finally
sent into a waiting room where for
a long time we watched others come
and go before a clerk came out and
asked us our business

  for a few minutes it seemed to me
that this haughty youngster might pre-
vent us from seeing any one but him-
self

  his excellency has no time to waste
on fishermen he declared petulantly
thb phantom u-boat



and this time i adopted the right atti-
tude with him i laid my hand on his
shoulder until the fingers sunk in and
commanded him

  you go in at once i said with
my face less than a foot from his and
tell his excellency and no one else that
there are two men here who wish to
see him on business of the highest and
most confidential nature and that they
decline to give their names now go

  i gave him a shove that threw him
halfway toward the door and by my
very lack of respect for him i presume
convinced him that we were certainly
something more than fishermen despite
our garb i have observed this trucu-
lence toward inferiors and cringing
toward superiors to be a characteristic
of not only a certain type of americans
but also prevalent among germans in
any case a bold front is the one to
assume as was proven by the rather
prompt return of my young man who
in a very subdued manner informed us
that we could see the consul within a
very few minutes eventually we were
conducted through one large office
where two men wrote rapidly through
a little antechamber and then into the
august presence of the consul himself
he sat with military stiffness in his
chair and though surrounded with a
warmth of luxury was himself as cold
as a piece of trondhjem ice he bored
us through with that unblinking blank
stare that is carefully drilled into a
prussian officer and expresses neither
fearlessness of soul nor complacent
self-confidence to some it is embar-
rassing but i was not in the least dis-
concerted and i fancy gave him a
little better than he sent inasmuch as
his pale eyes finally flickered and
veiled themselves

  what is it you wish he demanded
without show of courtesy and some-
what to olafs perturbation i think i
calmly indeed almost ostentatiously
got a chair for myself and dropped my

rough cap on the floor before reply-
ing

  we came here to ask what salvage
your government would pay for the
submarine boat called the sea fox i
said bluntly

  the effect was peculiar mask it as
he tried to i saw the consul betray a
most puzzling and intense interest his
hands suddenly tightened over the
arms of his chair and his head jerked
forward a trifle while his eyes opened
wider and this time were not blank

  i have never heard of such a boat
he declared after apparently thinking
over the nature of his reply before
speaking and i knew then and there
that he lied the boats of his im-
perial majesty are invariably known by
class letters and numbers he con-
cluded

  not when they are experimental
boats of such formidable and unknown
qualities as to necessitate the utmost
secrecy on their initial trips i as-
serted

  for a full minute he shifted his eyes
to the window and stared out over
the garden a minute is a long time
in which to sit and think i did some
of it myself and concluded that i had
best be on guard that i had stumbled
into something whose importance was
so highly esteemed and carefully
guarded by the german government
that it might prove a dangerous secret
that this was no case involving a mere
negotiation for salvage a dickering for
the highest price and a surrender of
the vessel that we shipwrecked men
had recovered improved and brought
to this neutral port

  what do you know about the sea
fox demanded the consul so quickly
as he abruptly swung his eyes on me
again that i was convinced he had
hoped to take me off guard

  but you have assured me there is
no such german boat i parried and


the cpocpular magazine

lie flushed knowing that i had called
his attempt

  his eyes dropped and he put a none
too steady hand out and toyed with a
tiny paper cutter in the shape of a
prussion sword that lay on his polished
desk

  that is scarcely an answer to my
question he said

  nor have you answered the first
one i formulated i retorted i
asked you what your government
would pay for the salvage of its sub-
marine experimental boat called the
sea fox i laid emphasis on my
words and paused to let them sink in
and then added the boat to be deliv-
ered into your hands at-at a stipu-
lated place within reason

  it was his turn to smile at me a
mere flicker of his eyes he had
caught my one stammering hesitancy

  well suppose we will say for argu-
ments sake you have her here-

  i have not said so i interjected
i asked what salvage would be paid
for her at a stipulated place

  which indicates that you have her
 seaworthy condition he said and
now i knew more than ever that i was
dealing with a cool dangerous man
whose brain was not of the lagging
order

  you cannot expect me to guarantee
her seaworthiness i said all that
your government can reasonably ask
or do is to state what price it will pay
for the sea fox landed at a point
within reason which predicates the
possibility that she is seaworthy

  i think perhaps the consul concluded
that his task might not prove so easy
for again he gazed abstractedly out of
the window for a long time and then
as if to render me more nervous by the
wait got up and walked to it and im-
politely turned his back on us he
walked deliberately back leaned across
his desk and almost glaring at me

snapped out you are an english-
man 

  i am not i retorted with equal
vehemence i am an american
instantly he came back at me in flaw-
less english have you anything to
prove that assertion 

  in english i replied but he had me
at a disadvantage inasmuch as i had
no proof whatever of my nationality
one does not have to prove his na-
tionality when he submits a proposition
to salvage

  you are no fisherman regardless of
your clothes he added still speaking
english it was weak

  of course i am not i retorted
the exigencies of my situation make
it necessary for me to observe secrecy
in any negotiation i may undertake
would you prefer that i come here
with a silk hat and a trumpeter shout-
ing aloud through the streets that i was
on my way to return to germany the
submarine on which she had experi-
mented and that might prove to pos-
sess unprecedented powers 

  and if you are a sailor he de-
clared after he had recovered from
that jolt you are not a common one
but a man of an educated and trained
mind

  i did not reply preferring to leave
him questioning with a rare change
that proved him to have been schooled
in the german style of diplomacy he
suddenly altered all his tactics and
leaned back and laughed with a great
assumption of heartiness i might
have been deceived had he assumed this
role in the first instance but he was
too late

  of course i know something about
a boat called the sea fox he said
but it is not always wise to say too
much until one is certain to whom one
talks is it eh but you speak a
very fine german friend for a time
you almost fooled me
the phantom u-boat	

  i won an honor in my class i
stated which was but the truth

  a very good german indeed
come let us get down to brass tacks
as some of your countrymen used to
say when i was-attached to washing-
ton where is the sea fox where did
you find her where is her crew and
exactly in what condition is she

  i am glad to hear you admit there
is such a boat i answered readily
enough i found her off the coast of
iceland with her dead crew aboard
what do you think she would be able
to do if perfected i concluded with
a burst of vanity that i now regret but
it was not for myself that it was voiced
but more that credit should be given
jack masters and the scientist-engineer
wirtz who had solved the problem of
modern storage batteries

  what can you make her do  he
countered so quickly that i was again
on guard

  what salvage rs she worth to you
in gold if she can do all she was be-
lieved capable of doing i asked
avoiding the giving of information as
readily as he

  he swung his massive head toward
olaf who was still standing helplessly
and listening with open mouth

  wouldnt you like to sit down the
consul asked in friendly manner as if
for the first time aware that olaf was
still standing instantly olaf touched
his forelock with a man-o-wars mans
salute and said thank you sir

  i suppose you are a partner in this
enterprise are you not asked the
consul eying olaf steadily

  whatever the captain says is good
enough for me sir i cant interfere
sir and he spoke it all with that devil-
ish cockney accent of the east end of
london where he had learned the
tongue

  what part of america do you come
from asked the consul with a great
pretense of politeness and poor olaf

who dared not admit that he was still
a norwegian subject stammered pit-
fully mumbled something about new
york and twisted his cap

  i began to see the trend of the con-
suls question and was annoyed with
myself for letting olaf come with me
but it had seemed necessary i stopped
this line of question by interrupting

  it seems to me i said that the
question of nationality or who or what
we are does not at all enter into this
i insist that we are here to make a
fair-and-square offer of salvaging the
submarine sea fox and should like to
know what the german government is
prepared to offer

  my dear captain suavely replied
the consul-and i took note of the way
he emphasized the title-it is very
essential to my government to know
where you have the sea fox and in
what condition you propose to turn her
over to my governments representa-
tives if she is seaworthy and in good
condition it would be far better for
you to turn her over to a german crew
that i might possibly provide and ac-
company her to swinemiinde on the
baltic where you could make the best
of terms

  no i said flatly i decline to con-
sider that proposition we deal here
why not make us an offer

  he considered that for a long time
and as if the problem were one requir-
ing careful action fell to walking al-
most absent-mindedly backward and
forward in his room that he did con-
sider the question important was estab-
lished by the fact that when a secretary
tapped on the door and opened it
thrusting in a cropped blond head the
consul brusquely swept him away with
his hand and a curt order that he was
not to be disturbed i watched his
peregrinations hoping from some word
or movement to gather together the
causes of his reluctance to know what
he was striving for to see how strong


the vow lav magazine

a hand he played i saw him lift his
head and move a little faster as if he
had come to a determination and then
he stopped and faced me and held out
his hand with that same pretense of
frank friendliness

  this is a matter that i shall have
to take up with berlin he said for
i am after all but a consul-a mere
consul-in this place i have not much
authority of my own it is a naval
matter of course and-where did you
say the sea fox is now 

  i did not say i responded accept-
ing his hand and ignoring the fact that
it was about as warm and friendly as
a sharks tail i asked what price

would-

  yes yes ill ask and find out
about that he said as if i had not
just again declined to answer his ques-
tion ill communicate at once could
you call here-say-to-morrow at this
same hour

  he consulted his watch slowly and
steadfastly as if it required a mental
calculation to compute the time of day
and when i said yes promptly
made a memorandum on a tablet that
lay on his desk

  very well he said smiling and
straightening his shoulders as if more
accustomed to uniformed collars than
loose civilian garb i shall see that

you are admitted at once captain-

  roberts said i preserving my
identity

 he made another memorandum of
the fictitious name i had given him
and with a very strained graciousness
and air of friendliness bowed us to the
door

chapter vii

  we found olafs cousin in the rear
end of a water-front inn and i was
impressed by the manner of his finding
olaf came in and mumbled something
to the proprietor who clad in an apron
that had some time been white was

serving drinks to numerous men of the
sailor type and i saw the proprietor
cast a scrutinizing glance at me before
he disappeared in the rear a little
later he appearedin the dark passage-
way and still out of sight of the men
at the tables nodded to olaf and made
a gesture

  we are to wait here mumbled
olaf and proceeded to buy some
drinks we sat at a table to drink
them and watched the patrons of the
place most of whom appeared to be
mere idlers until olafs cousin ap-
peared and led the way into the street

  his boat the norskman had been
burdened with several bales and boxes
during our absence

  trading goods explained olaf
with that same surreptitious wink that
was so eloquent

  i thought it best not to appear too
curious so said nothing during the
homeward journey the fiord in day-
light appeared almost populous there
was a constant stream of small craft
ascending and descending up to the
point where we turned off for our own
inlet but when we entered it we were
at once in a lonely little water of our
own it was a veritable retreat i
wondered as we passed over the spot
where the sea fox lay at rest on the
bottom if jack and the crew were
asleep or if they listened to the sound
of our screw above them

  we were waiting on the end of the
wharf at midnight when we saw the
first disturbance of the water begin
then the swirl and curl as first the
periscope and then the top of the con-
ning tower lifted out of the water like
some sea monster come from the depths
to stare about we were aboard within
a few minutes and telling jack and the
crew of what had taken place

 there was vast disappointment
aboard the boat that our deal had not
come to a speedier conclusion and it
was voiced although respectfully
the phantom u-boat



enough to avoid offense i sympathized
with all of them for if any one be-
lieves that a submarine no matter how
luxurious and commodious can be
other than a steel prison when men are
confined to it for weeks he has never
been aboard one and here our fel-
lows were not only debarred from
going on land to move freely but
compelled to remain submerged about
twenty-two hours out of twenty-four
and therefore cut off from the open
air worst of all the negotiations
might last a full week longer

  the crew fell to talking among
themselves as they lounged about the
deck and looked longingly at the moon-
lit shores and jack olaf scruggs
tinker and i were going over the situ-
ation when the norwegian gave a start
and pointed down toward the entrance
to the little harbor a boat was com-
ing in much to our alarm i was about
to call the crew to quarters when olaf
laid a hand on my arm

  its all right he said thats my
cousins boat but something has gone
wrong with him

  gone wrong

  yes sir the fact is-i dont know
as i should tell it but you may as well
know-he started out a while ago to
supply a german boat with fuel and
supplies

  then that means- i started to

say but saw olaf shake his head du-
biously the boat came steadily up
until she was almost abreast of us and
then olaf hailed in a voice that was
softened to a mere call his cousin
answered and the engines stopped
the way of the boat brought her to
within a few yards of our own where
she lay on the still water they talked
for a minute and olaf turned to us

  my cousin has had a narrow es-
cape government patrol boats are out
down toward the mouth of the fiord
had he not been warned by a boatman
he keeps down there for such emer-
b p

gency he would have blundered into
them its hard luck all right if the
patrol happened to come here at any
time and catch his boat loaded to the
gunnels with that kind of stuff it would

be- he snapped his fingers and

shook his head to indicate calamity

  hang it all i exclaimed to jack
hes been mighty decent to us heres
a way where we can play even we
can take his cargo and pay for it out
of the ships money the consul can
have no kick coming merely because
we bought supplies in fact if we come
to terms he might be thankful to us
for turning her over in full form and
pay more salvage for that very reason
eh

  sure as youre a foot high my
partner answered lets take em

  it would be a big help to him if you
did asserted olaf who had been lis-
tening with some eagerness

  then tell him we will take all he
has at the prices he would have been
paid by the german commander i
said and olaf translated the message
across the water

  the estuary was so still that we
actually moored the boats together for
the transfer and the smuggler was the
first to come aboard and shake our
hands he babbled in his own tongue

  my cousin says he is grateful-that
he is already suspected and therefore
likely to be watched-that for you to
take his cargo makes it certain he will
not be caught-that he thinks it best to
work fast olaf translated in jerky
sentences and i lost no time in giving
the necessary orders all of us fell to
and worked with a rush and it was a
pretty sight most of the men were
stripped to the waists as they warmed
up and the moonlight shone on their
sweating backs and quickly moving
muscles as they brought barrels aboard
attached them to the intakes pulled
empties away and stove in their heads
that they might be weighted and sunk

or carried boxes of provisions below
through the forward hatchway there
was not a supply in the lot that had
not been specially packed to fit the re-
quirements of a submarine whose hatch
space is necessarily limited

  i will admit that the prices i had to
pay were pretty steep but i have not
the least doubt that they were exactly
the ones that olafs cousin would have
received had he delivered his goods to
their intended purchaser moreover i
did not particularly care if he did make
a big profit because the german gov-
ernment should and must pay

  we stood on the deck in the moon-
light and olafs cousin was preparing
to cast off my men who had re-
clothed themselves stood watching him
enviously when i recalled how hard
they had worked and how obedient and
willing they had proved themselves

  impulsively i called to olafs skip-
per cousin to hold a moment and then
spoke to jack

  say it looks pretty tough to keep
all the men here this way why cant
we give some of them shore leave
what do you think

  i think its a good idea he said
promptly theres no use in all of us
being cooped up there on the bottom
day after day for perhaps a week or
ten days tinker and i can submerge
her and bring her to the surface again
just as well as fifty men could but do
you think we dare let em loose 
not here in a little place like this
i said but maybe we could arrange
it with the skipper

  i called olaf and told him what we
proposed to do and he held a long
conversation with his cousin

  my cousin says that if they can be
depended on he will take them ashore
stow them away below early in the
morning run down to a place we know
where they can be landed and they can
walk to bergen then he can pick

them up in the evening and bring them
back

  good tell him i will pay what is
right i said and olaf patiently trans-
lated

  i called the crew up abaft the super-
structure and laid it down to them

  if you men could give your abso-
lute word of honor that youll stay
dead-cold sober and keep your mouths
shut i will arrange for a day on shore
i began and they threatened to forget
the necessities for silence and break
into a cheer but i checked them

  for heavens sake dont yell i
commanded we cant afford to take
any chances whatsoever until were in
the clear again thats why i insist
that if you do go ashore to-morrow no
man is to take a drink he might
talk too much

  thats quite right captain as-
serted scruggs and the police com-
mittee will see to it that no man does
if you give us shore leave how about
it boys

  their protestations lacked nothing of
fervency

  then get below and clean up i
said look as decent as you can
youre supposed to be merchant sailors
off some yankee smoke boat

  olaf talked with his cousin again
and the latter said he would return in
two hours when he thought it would
be best to start but he was puzzled
how the boat could submerge with but
two men aboard when told that this
was the number to remain olaf ex-
plained but the skipper shook his head
stolidly

  how much does she draw he
asked and i told olaf her depth when
on the surface

  more talk followed and olaf said
he says why not take her to a place
he knows-a grotto-and let her stay
there she will be safe and he trusts
that the two men left will not touch
anything they find there
the phantom u-boat



  full of sympathy forjack and tin-
ker i assured him that the boat was
better on the surface than resting on
the bottom of the sea and also that it
gave the sea fox s chance to remain
open during the day another long
conversation ensued that was partici-
pated in by the members of the skip-
pers crew and a watch was frequently
consulted i began to wonder what the
hitch was before olaf explained

  the place they go to is deep enough
at any time but only a small boat can
come out at low tide i can take you in
at any time and you can come up in-
side but he wants the men to agree
that they will forget all about it after
they leave here you see its not
known by anybody but a very few men
of this village they dont tell their
wives even my cousin and his crew
say you have proved to be white men
and they trust you but they dont want
any one to know about this place

  i took my usual recourse and talked
to the crew i think i had a blunt elo-
quence that night when i gave them a
mans talk on being loyal and square to
any one who was loyal and square to
them and it worked they gave a
few more words in attestation than i
can tell you the skipper of the smug-
gler stood behind olaf at the wheel
and his vessel slowly followed astern
when we turned on the power and ran
farther up the inlet until it narrowed
to a point where the rays of the moon
barely penetrated the skipper said
something to olaf at a moment when
it appeared to me we were about to
butt our nose into the cliff and olaf
signaled to stop the engines we
drifted slowly toward the glistening
face of the cliff before we came to a
full stop and the sea fox lost way

  we shall have to submerge to about
eight fathoms sir olaf said and i
gave the order taking a chance on
his proven skill

  then for a minute we went slowly

ahead once i heard her rub and i
think from the vehement remarks they
interchanged in their native tongue
that olaf and the skipper were both
annoyed and frightened and then
slowly we emerged and lay quietly on
the surface i looked about it was
darker than black velvet the moons
rays no longer cleared the blackness
olaf picked up an electric torch from
a convenient shelf and we opened the
conning-tower hatch- and climbed on
deck he waved it aloft and i saw
that we were in an immense cavern
whose roof gave back stray reflections
where surface moisture had crept
through fissures

  over there said olaf pointing
with his torch we pass out

  he extinguished the torch and even
as i looked i saw a boat silhouetted
against a bright spot in the background
its rowers stooping low to avoid the
rocky roof the torch flared again
and the rowers came alongside the
crew came tumbling up from below
and took turns in being transported to
the smugglers boat outside where out
on a lark they stowed themselves away
like sardines in a tin i left on the
last trip and felt sorry for jack and
tinker who were doomed to spend the
day in idleness

  most of us napped on the way down
to the place where we were to be
landed and there again we came to a
trial for we had to scale a cleft in the
rock to a little wooded plateau after
which we were assured there would
be some more climbing that would
bring us out on top barely three miles
from the outskirts of bergen

  with the seamans habit of catching
naps when possible we all tumbled to
the patch of grass in the copse and
slept the sun was high when the first
man aroused and with olaf in the
lead we resumed our march we made
our way in groups but keeping sight
of one another to the smugglers inn


the tpovulatr magazine

where we took up nearly all the land-
lords dining room and had a very late
breakfast i felt liberal now that we
were so near to real money and in-
vited all hands to be there at three
oclock in the afternoon for a dinner
at my expense so confident was i of
forthcoming success i felt as if we
were about to separate and scatter out
to the seven seas after our common
vicissitudes that the end of our adven-
ture was in sight that my command of
the sea fox with its attendant respon-
sibilities was almost terminated i
was actually saddened by the thought
when olaf and i bade the crew good-by
and hastened away to the consulate

  this time there was no difficulty in
reaching his excellency we were im-
mediately ushered in to receive a
cordial greeting he shook hands with
each of us as if we had become friends
he was urbane and smiling

  i am sorry he said after his greet-
ing that i have had no reply to my
queries save an acknowledgment of re-
ceipt and the assurance that we shall
be able to quote figures late this eve-
ning he threw his heavy white
hands upward in a gesture of annoy-
ance war time renders it difficult
for all of us it takes hours to get a
reply that in ordinary moments would
be answered by a prompt yes or
no i am sure you appreciate the
difficulties captain

  he swept away any lingering distrust
i had by his sheer loquacity and friend-
liness he pulled open a cabinet at the
side of the room and tendered a drink
asking us to name our choice

  whats yours-or whatll you
have he asked with a laugh and
added gayly you see i did not neg-
lect my study of your colloquialisms
while resident in your magnificent
country sometimes i sigh for those
old days when i was so much younger
and regarded washington as my home
ah you americans are a wonderful

people your great men are so frank
so outspoken so sincere european
diplomacy strikes one as foolishly ob-
scure and needless after one becomes
acquainted with your blunt straight-
forward methods you do not drink
very well you can do me the favor of
smoking i am rather proud of my
cigars they are the best i have ever
smoked fine as you say in america 

 he offered us an open box of
havana cigars and somehow i had a
flash of real intelligence that made me
pause to digest it

  why was it that his excellency the
consul of his imperial majesty of
greater germany smoked cigarettes
handed us an unbroken box of havana
cigars lighted one himself and then
carelessly threw it aside and lighted a
cigarette somehow it seemed like the
action of a man who was dissembling
and why this outburst of camaraderie
without cause  a salvage operation
does not imply a mushroom friendship
and i judged by his cold attitude on
our first audience that he was hardly
the man to become cordial in one meet-
ing he smiled with his lips and not
with his pale eyes that were always
hard and bright the smile did not ex-
tend above the corners of his lips and
nostrils moreover there was about
him a nervousness of enterprise that
had not been apparent on our previous
visit he consulted a desk pad on
which were scribbled appointments
excused himself as if perplexed by one
of them and passed into another room
i wondered why he had not summoned
one of his numerous secretaries if he
wished information and looked at
olaf who was staring absently at the
window the wait was extended and
i got to my feet and looked idly out of
the consulate window on the garden be-
low trying to resolve into something
cohesive the little discrepancies that
had perhaps oversuspiciously regis-
tered in my mind
the phantom u-boat



  when i looked around olaf was
standing beside the desk calmly
going through some papers in a desk
basket on the consuls desk i had not
time to reprimand him for we heard
voices outside and were seated when
the consul returned

  i find he said that i have ap-
pointments until my dinner hour cap-
tain and guests to dinner it is awk-
ward very awkward for i suppose
i shall have to act as entertainer for at
least an hour or so after the conclusion
of our meal doubtless you are eager
to get the matter of the sea fox set-
tled immediately i know how you
americans hustle you see of course
you are stopping here in the city
the flash of his eyes told me that he
had resorted to his old shallow attempt
at surprise

  of course i answered where
else pray the interior of norway
has few hotels

  then would it be asking too much
of you to return here at-say-ten
oclock this evening that makes it
certain that i shall have received a
reply to my very urgent inquiries
ten oclock it is i said arising
and again he conducted us to the door

  we trudged a long way down the
street and came to the business section
before either of us spoke olaf broke
my chain of thought by suddenly stop-
ping and looking at me with his lazy
blue eyes that somehow no longer
looked so stupid to me as they had
prior to our last few days association
i was learning that under this mask of
stolidity was a keen mind

  well what do you think of him
he asked

 i scarcely know he has done
nothing that was unreasonable and yet
-little things trifles why

  ive thought the same he said
quietly that mans up to some game
why ten oclock to-night thats a
late hour for a big german official

when he might as well have said come
to-morrow because i may not have an
answer until late 

 that is true i admitted and
yet this is no ordinary transaction in
the first place he knows our demand
is going to be large next he wants
to know exactly what we have to de-
liver and in what condition and where
next ive an idea that he wishes to get
credit from his kaiser for an exceed-
ingly adroit piece of work because
william hohenzollern is liberal in re-
warding those who serve him well
and last of all neither the consul nor
the german government desire any-
thing so much as secrecy regarding
their possession of such a boat as they
think the sea fox might prove to be
in keeping that secret is their strength
inasmuch as they propose to make sub-
marines their chief naval aim and can-
not hope to conquer at sea unless their
submarines prove capable of handling
the british navy they know that they
havent a dogs chance at sea unless the
submarine does make good because
argue as any one will its a dead open-
and-shut fact that britain does rule the
seas has the best navy in the-world
andmore trained and competent sailors
than any other nation can possibly
have in less than twenty years hard
work

  i had been arguing to myself try-
ing to bring my own conjectures to a
head through the sound of my own
voice mumbling my words there at a
street corner while busy men passed
to and fro

  theyve got to have that sub-
marine i said when my companion
did not immediately respond and
theyve got to pay our price

  but suppose they wont pay until
they get possession of the boat olaf
insisted in his slow cockney drawl

  then they shant have her until they
put the money up in the hands of some
third party i said


the popular magazine

  olaf shook his head and stared ab-
sently at the pavement i saw that he
was opposed to any condition but cash
in hand

 you dont trust the consul i
asked

  no i dont hes too smooth hes
up to something

  i laughed derisively

  he doesnt dare attempt anything
irregular i declared we are big
enough to hold our own weve got
the whip hand of it he will probably
try to get something for nothing but
we can beat him at his own game i
dont trust him either but he has got
to come to our terms

  olaf still shook his head then con-
sulted a battered old silver watch and
said he thought it was time for us to
have that dinner with our crew i
was neither depressed nor in high fettle
when we resumed our walk to the
smugglers inn in fact i was absorbed
in thinking over what sum i could rea-
sonably declare my minimum

  we found the crew waiting for us
and they were duly sober i was rather
proud of those chaps and the way they
kept their pledges i bought the din-
ner from the ships funds and it wasnt
a bad one either save that the light
german claret was our strongest liba-
tion i told them that i would meet
them at the inn that evening at some
time between eleven oclock and mid-
night and that they were to wait for
me and then asked olaf to go with me
to purchase a list of articles that jack
had asked me to get out in the street
he turned back saying that he had for-
gotten to tell the men that if any of
them needed an interpreter he would
get them a safe man from the inn

 go ahead i said  that is
thoughtful of you all right they
should have somebody they can trust to
pilot them round ill pay for it

  and he hastened back into the low-
ceilinged dingy oak-beamed room

where he had dined i began to be
restless before he appeared but he was
filled with apologies he said he had
arranged for a man to go with them
and show them the sights and diverted
my thought by calling attention to some
of the strange sights that can be seen
in that far northern city he borrowed
money from me to buy a magazine gun
saying that he had long wished to make
a present to his cousin i offered him
one i had in my pocket that i had
found in the sea foxs cabin but he
scorned it because it was slightly rusty

  no when i make a present to my
cousin he said it must be no second-
hand thing

  and smiling at his stubbornness i
watched him buy an expensive pistol
and some cartridges wondering in the
meantime how much the skipper-smug-
gler would appreciate such a weapon
and whether he might ever have occa-
sion to use it he bought a small elec-
tric torch for his own use and thrust it
into his hip pocket he bought sweets
that he munched in the streets and a

concertina that he tested with much

 j i

skill and carried around with him un-
der his arm evidently he was enjoy-
ing himself but despite our dallying
we rang the consuls bell at exactly ten
oclock and were immediately received

chapter viii

 the room was very brilliantly
lighted one caught such strong re-
flections from the glass chandelier
above the consuls desk that each
article upon the latter lay as upon a
mirror of black the heavy curtains
had been carefully drawn over the two
windows in the apartment and over
the french doors leading to the gar-
den the place impressed one with
somber elegance and-conspiracies

  the consul beckoned us to chairs
but olaf blundering and awkward
did not take the one pointed out to
the phantom u-boat



him but crossed to another in front
of one of the windows sat heavily
down on it first hung his cap on the
back then as if ashamed of this dis-
courtesy removed it carefully rubbed
off the chair standard as if to free it
from contamination and put his cap
on the floor the consul smiled a trifle
beneath his upturned mustache and
addressed himself to me after he had
dropped into the big ornate chair be-
hind the desk

  well what price have you decided
would be fair for the sea fox delivered
to us here or at a place we may name
conveniently near here

  we americans have the reputation
abroad of being rather keen when it
comes to bargaining but i dont think
that ordinarily i am if the submarine
had been mine individually i should
have probably named a ridiculously
moderate price but the fact that jack
masters and all that crew had so
blindly trusted me and left affairs in
my personal care made me a bit of
a booster also i knew that we had
perfected her which was worth con-
siderable and furthermore she was
more valuable to germany in her fight
than any naval implement in her pos-
session the combination made me
bold

  we regard her as worth just five
hundred thousand dollars in american
gold i said quietly

  the consuls eyes grew round he
elevated his eyebrows pursed his lips
as if to whistle and then leaned his
head back from his stiff rigid shoul-
ders and laughed

  did you say five hundred thousand
or five thousand  he inquired with
mock politeness

  very calmly i repeated the figures

  and i suppose he said dryly
that you wouldnt take a cent less 

  his manner was as annoying to me
as any manner could have been he
was not only patronizing but jeering

he was not only jeering but he was
totally insincere

  not a cent less

  and i suppose also that you can
deliver her here if i ask it in perfect
running order 

  it was on the very tip of my tongue
to say yes but he spoiled it by add-
ing  with her original crew intact
eh and any experimental defects of
construction she might have had com-
pletely remedied also with a guaran-
tee that she is the original sea fox

  i did not answer i was amazed
by his attitude i could not in the least
conjecture what he was aiming at

  you choose to make a joke of
this i said coldly but you are mak-
ing a grave mistake i assure you you
are not dealing with intellectual crip-
ples we care for neither your jokes
nor your patronage personally i have
no wish to prolong this affair why
dont you say what you are prepared
to offer you doubtless know by this
time where the sea fox was built
what it was hoped she could do and
what she originally cost dont you 
do you he asked stiffening in
his chair and dropping his air of good
nature

  some of it-yes

  and you would like captain rob-
erts to know the rest of it wouldnt
you  that part that you dont know 
i should be interested certainly
his eyes suddenly narrowed and
flashed his hair close-cropped and
gray appeared to bristle his body
tensed in the chair and he brought a
fist banging down on the top of the
mahogany desk with such force that
the bronze inkstand and ornaments
thereon rattled

  you english are fools he roared
you never can understand that the
german is so superior to you in in-
tellect that he laughs at you-derides
you-and is only amused by your silly
blunders you thought you could


the popular magazine

come here and get information bah
look at this

  he jerked a consular telegraphic
form from his desk transmitted in
code and with a copy of the meaning
attached he handed it to me and i
read

  sea fox proved failure undoubtedly
sunk in north sea maiden trip collapsible
bearing her name and sailors belongings
found together with one body of crew how
did spies learn of her importance  get in-
formation at all cost

  if i could prove to you-

  you can prove nothing he thun-
dered you can ask no questions
you must and shall answer my ques-
tions and if you dont i shall not hesi-
tate to use force-you -- english

swine 

  now i have never been accustomed
to submit to abuse id rather fight
and lose than submit to it also al-
though i can ordinarily control my tem-
per there are times when i cannot
to sit tamely and have this big
egotistical bluffer jump on me that way
and attempt to shut me up like an im-
pertinent schoolboy dressed down by
his teacher was a little too much

  im neither english nor a fool
i retorted hotly im not a spy nor
a pretender of any sort you will al-
low me to say whether you wish it or
not that you yourself are one of the
biggest asses i have ever had the mis-
fortune to meet ive known many in-
telligent germans highly intelligent
and im amazed that your government
should have selected so stupid a fel-
low as yourself to represent them
youll make me do something rats
you cant make me do anything i
dont wish to try it on and then
after you get as much sense thumped
into your thick skull as an american
schoolboy has well resume our talk
about salvage

i had said more than i intended to
being rather intoxicated and elated by

the play of his features i never saw
a man so astonished so shocked so
paralyzed by the unexpected he went
white red and purple he gurgled
stammered puffed and spouted but
some slight touch of sanity returned
to him some hesitancy of caution and
cunning

  can you prove that you are an
american  he demanded

  i dont have to to you i replied
and then he laid his hand on the table

  youll have to before you go he
announced you are on german soil
when you are in this consulate i ac-
cuse you and your confederate of
being english spies and shall hold you
until i am convinced to the contrary

  if you try that on you will prove
yourself a bigger fool than i took you
to be which will be going consider-
ably i said

  he accepted my challenge with sur-
prising agility considering his age and
size he appeared to leap from his
chair without using his legs and be-
fore either olaf or i could intervene
had reached and jerked a bell cord by
the side of the mantelpiece instantly
the two doors of the apartment opened
and four men with sabers rushed in

  i knew at once that we were in for
a fight and furthermore that his ex-
cellency proposed that it should be a
noiseless one because otherwise his
underlings would have been armed
with better weapons

  but his men were not afraid i give
them credit for that nor was he
without the same sort of courage that
makes a bull try to butt a locomotive
off the track for before they were
well in the room i had my gun pointed
at his abdomen and threatened if
you undertake to stir this mess up its
a cinch there will be one dead man in
this room and that will be you on
the first move they make ill let you
have it as sure as youre a pig-headed
slob  that goes 
the phantom u-oat



  i said he was brave he shouted
in german dont mind me men
seize him

  his men shut the doors behind them
and started forward my finger
quite willing and determined was al-
ready pressing the trigger that would
have certainly meant his death when
the big french doors came open with
a smash thrusting the curtains aside
and pell-mell itching for a fight and
recklessly intent on rescuing olaf and
me the crew of the sea fox charged
into the room it was over in a mo-
ment olaf seemed to be in command
and shouted hoarse orders a chair
came crashing down on the consuls
head felling him to the floor his
soldiers went down and would have
been kicked and beaten to death i am
sure had i not with difficulty dragged
my crew away

  sorry - captain said olaf in his
cockney-chopped sentences but we
talked it over and thought it best to
keep an eye on this bloke you trusted
him sir but i didnt take it for mine
the torch through the window was the
signal that we needed help

  i knew then why he had bought both
gun and torch but it was a sorry mess
all chance of a deal with the govern-
ment represented so stupidly by his ex-
cellency was gone for a moment i
thought that he also was for he lay
where he had fallen with a rather
nasty scalp wound and very still his
arms outflung and his dress-shirt front
liberally stained an ugly color i
feared each instant to hear servants
battering at the door and the fact that
none did leads me to believe that his
excellency had cleared them off for the
evening lest his work assume too ugly
a character however we took no
chances

  boost up on one anothers shoul-
ders and cut these bell cords carefully
i ordered look sharp there some of
you and gag these gentlemen

  in a jiffy the bell cords were down
all five of the defeated well bound and
we were ready to clear i took a last
look at the consul his eyes fluttered
open and if the baron could have car-
ried out what he threatened by their
expression my shrift would have been
extremely short

  clear out men i said sharply and
then as an afterthought i scooped all
the papers from the barons confiden-
tial tray thrust them in my pocket
switched off the lights and ran out
into the shrubbery i had no further
idea at the time than that of furnish-
ing the consul further ground for be-
lieving that i was in truth a british
spy the theft of the papers might
help to throw him off the real scent
a vital hope with me now that it was
certain we had a powerful enemy
against us

  we must get back aboard the sea
fox and clear out of this at once
i said to my men when we were out-
side the consulate grounds lead the
way olaf and all of you scatter out
until we get clear of the town so we
shant attract attention well join up
outside the place but keep moving

  olaf scruggs and i took the ad-
vance and it was very fortunate for
us that olaf knew the district so
thoroughly for he led us over a route
so direct though obscure that within
a few minutes we were clear of the
last house and waiting for the others
to close vp i took cotmt and found
that all were there before we moved on

  well boys i said crestfallen and
disappointed by my failure ive
balled the whole thing up  the deal is
off as far as salvage is concerned

  and it wasnt his fault either i
know i was there we were dealing
with a swine who started to play
crooked from the minute we first met
him im still for the captain olaf
exploded and gestured as if to de-
fend me


the pocpuljlcr magazine

  good for you lad but you dont
have to tell us anything about the skip-
per  his word still goes for us
scruggs exclaimed

  and if it had not been for olaf i
added wed have been trapped like a
pair of weasels

  thats just what he was afraid of
sir when he came back to the restau-
rant and told us after you left he
told us how to get there and that we
was to be there at ten sharp and to
keep quiet unless we saw a flasljfrom
a window we didnt want you to
come to no harm sir because there
aint one of us that dont say that
youve treated us white clean through
exclaimed another

  there was a rumble of approval
mixed with some rather profane em-
phasis from which sounded scruggs
voice saying and if the captain
didnt pull it off nobody could

  somehow the unqualified and un-
hesitating support of these chaps did
more to buck me up as i stood there
in the gloom a very disappointed and
discouraged man than anything else
could have done i couldnt put it in
words but what i did try to say and
couldnt they seemed to understand i
got away from a very awtkward and
embarrassing situation by emphasizing
the necessity for haste bergen had
me terrified it had been a port of
hope that failed there was no tell-
ing how much the consul knew how
soon the hue and cry would start after
us nor what charges he would bring
against olaf and me to get us help-
lessly in his power aside from mo-
tives of revenge he could scarcely let
us get away and keep face with his
home office he would leave no effort
undone to apprehend us i was con-
vinced

  we hastened forward silently and
in single file over a hill path sounds
wrere magnified and sight was magni-
fied away below us i heard the clear-

ing blasts of a steamer hoarse and
heavy-some ship sailing away from
this spot that to me was unlucky i
envied her commander and looking
back over my shoulder saw the lights
of bergen laid out in long lines the
riding lights in the harbor and far far
away the beacon leading to the cape

 i trudged along with my angry
thoughts and discouragement i
thought how disappointed jack would
be when i came trailing back with a
story of defeat like a whipped hound
with his tail between his legs here
was an end to all his dreams that he
had confided to me-dreams that re-
quired money for their realization

  he had more dreams than i and
better ones for there was a woman in
them friends in them whom he wished
to assist his own inventions to be
worked to fruitfulness mine were-
well-of no similar consequence be-
cause there was no time limit fixed for
their realization why there was
scarcely a man of the crew that had
not indulged in air castles and told
with seamans candor of what he pro-
posed to make his future oddly
enough those born in cities craved
farms and those born on farms craved
all sorts of ridiculous city enterprises
i heard a lot from that little navigating
bridge in the calm nights when we were
running on the surface and headed for
bergen that had become a bagdad
where dwelt a caliph wise and generous
who would freely bestow fortune i
was pretty bitter i can tell you

  we scrambled down the steep paths
of the cliff to the copse where we had
slept that morning through it and
down the cleft and found olafs
cousin waiting he was excited and
distressed he poured forth a mum-
bled rapidly told tale to olaf who
turned to me

  captain he said the consul has
had us followed probably yesterday
when we were there i dont know
he phantom u-ftoat



what charge he laid but to-day there
was a government patrol boat in the
inlet and its men came to my cousins
house and asked many questions they
asked if two men were stopping with
him and described us he told them
no but they were not satisfied until
they had gone down and found his
boat moored to the wharf and they
went over her from stem to stem
then they searched his house and the
outbuildings my cousin asked what
the two men were wanted for and was
told there was a charge made against
them made by the german consul
they asked my cousin if he had not
brought them up the fiord in his boat
last night and fortunately he said
yes and that he had taken us as pas-
sengers and landed us at bjornsens
point that he knew nothing more
that we had paid him for the passage
and that he had asked no questions
they went away as if they were not
quite satisfied

  humph his excellency was play-
ing a stronger and more skillful hand
than i thought him capable of was
taking no chances at either end is it
safe for your cousin to take us back
olaf grinned and glanced at his kins-
man who was stolidly watching us

  you can bet he plays safe wait
till i ask him

  they exchanged a few sentences
and olaf transmitted he came down
here in broad daylight and saw the
patrol boat at bjornsens point to
show that he had nothing to be afraid
of he pulled up alongside and pointed
out the path he saw us take-or said
he saw us take then he sat and
smoked a while and talked with the
men aboard and came on down here
but thats not all before he left the
inlet he made arrangements of the sort
that those smugglers up there can
make which is that if its unsafe for
us to run in there to-night we will have
to land somewhere else

  old chap seems to be a bit of a fixer
himself grunted scruggs who had
been listening

  and he says we had best get aboard
at once added olaf

  we tumbled into the boat and stowed
ourselves into the bottom she swung
out into the fiord and began thrashing
upward at what i took to be a pretty
stiff turn of speed for such a craft we
were still in the main fiord and at
least two miles from the inlet i should
say when the skipper who had the
wheel suddenly let rip what sounded
to me like a good norwegian oath and
motioned the engines down at the
same time he swung her hard over and
i heard olaf say as to himself twin
lights  something urgent up

  we came to a stop within two or
three yards of the shore and a mans
voice hailed cautiously i think  he
must have asked for a line because
the man forard promptly threw one
and we were slowly pulled to shore
olaf the skipper and two men on the
beach talked rapidly for a moment
then olaf called me in a quiet voice
as if fearing to be overheard at a dis-
tance and said all out captain
please and-hurry 

  we scrambled ashore and the last
man had to leap because olafs cousin
had already started his engines and was
swinging away toward the middle of
the fiord and the broadest moonlight
as if courting inquiry

  a government patrol boat one of
the big ones with a dozen men aboard
is laid squarely across the entrance to
the arm olaf said they have been
there since dusk they are-whats
that he interrupted himself at a
sound coming up the fiord

  wte heard the barking explosions of
a high-power craft striking rever-
berating and echoing from the cliffs
as if not one but a flotilla of boats
was tearing up the fiord from bergen
at- full speed


the popular magazine

 take cover men quickly i
shouted out of sight with you

  in a moment it would have been al-
most impossible for any one to sus-
pect that a human being was anywhere
near the echoes from the walls in-
creased to machine-gun volume and
suddenly around a bend a long ray of
white light shot shoreward to the oppo-
site side then swept back and flashed
coldly over our hiding place flickered
against the clump of firs then shifted
direct ahead and pinned itself on the
craft we had so lately abandoned it
was for all the world like a moving
picture and we could distinctly see
olafs cousin calmly lounging over his
wheel and smoking then we made
the outline of a long high-powered
craft and could see the huge wave cur-
ling forward to be spread in other
waves in her wake in the moonlight
the crests behind appeared to be chas-
ing her angrily and intent on capture
we heard a loud command and saw
olafs cousin phlegmatically stop his
engines and as suddenly the pur-
suer reversed stopped her racing head-
way came alongside and her engines
were also stopped the stillness fol-
lowing the last of the echoes was thick
enough to cut the water carried her
commanders voice as only water can
carry sound olaf mumbled a steady
translation

 you are the norskman arent
you 

  yes what do you want

  this is coast-service boat c-n on
his majestys service you must an-
swer my questions who have you on
board there 

  no one but myself and the regu-
lar crew olafs cousin promptly re-
plied

you are the man who took two men
to bjornsens point yesterday arent
you or that is-you said you did
well if i said so lieutenant i did
olafs cousin somewhat hotly replied

  then where are they now  de-
manded the officer

  how should i know  i said i
landed them yesterday at the point
wthy what about them are they
wanted 

  yes for being dangerous british
spies who to-night broke into the ger-
man consulate tried to murder the con-
sul stole all his papers and got away
there was a gang of men with them

and- weve got to come aboard

and search you

  youre welcome replied the skip-
per and then jocosely put out some
fenders so you wont scar my paint
remembering the dingy black sides
of the norskman i could appreciate
the joke the boats drew closer to-
gether and we saw men scramble
aboardthe smuggler we could no
longer hear their conversation

  they are searching her muttered
olaf and they certainly think it
pretty important to nab us they
wouldnt have sent what i know is one
of the fastest boats in the harbor if

  weve played in luck anyhow i
interrupted it might be that some
of the consuls servants returned very
soon after we left then of course
all he had to do was to telephone an
alarm to set them on us if they are
there to-morrow--

  to-morrow olaf rolled over on
his side and faced me

  we cant wait till to-morrow cap-
tain they have been anxious to catch
my cousin napping for a long time
now the guard wont be taken off
that arm until every house every
cranny every foot of that cove has
been searched and if they find the
entrance to the grotto at low tide-
well its prison for my cousin and if
the sea fox isnt out its ten to one
she gets caught theres a pretty pow-
erful gun aboard that last patrol-and
the phantom uoat



- he turned back to get a view

of it and called my attention

  the patrol boat and the smuggler
side by side has started their engines
and were going away together-up the
fiord

  detained him i exclaimed

  just that olaf said quietly

  i got on my knees and watched the
two boats out of sight and was much
distressed

  we must hurry now olaf said
resignedly i doubt if we can make
it over the top and down to the mouth
of the grotto before the tide turns as
it is

  in a sudden burst of annoyance i
called the men to listen and put it up
to them straight boys i said in
conclusion i dont know how you
feel about it but as for me im in
favor of getting back there at once and
while weve got time to work cleaning
out all the smuggling evidence there is
in the grotto we cant afford to let a
fellow that has got himself in danger
by helping us go to jail because we
didnt help him

  there was no disagreement in their
assent and we almost ran up the steep
hillside at times we had to climb and
any lot of men in less fit physical con-
dition would have found the pace im-
possible we had no breath for words
we scrambled and climbed upward and
slipped and slid downward until we
came to a rocky jut some seven or eight
feet above the waters edge and were
told by olaf that this was the arm of
the fiord

  right down there at that little black
spot he said pointing is all that is
left of the opening to the grotto it
will be closed in a half hour or less
any one who wants to get in will have
to swim the tide is with him

  good i declared all of you
that can swim or dive say so

  there was but one man scruggs

who could do neither and yet he
wished to take his chances with the
rest

  i can take him on my back sir
olaf said

  then you two go first i ordered 
and they slid into the water

  the crew followed them i went
last and when i struck the entrance
bumped my head before i had gone
five feet then turned on my back to
get my lips up to the air and finally
had to dive blindly thrusting forward
to feel my way and wondering if my
lungs would crack from pressure be-
fore i could find an opening i am
more than an average swimmer but i
knew what it was that night to fear
drowning i came bang up against
something harder and smoother than
rock walls and my heart gave a leap
for i knew it was the hull of the sea
fox i rose to the surface and for
several seconds fought for breath i
must have turned out of my course and
swam many yards farther than neces-
sary to reach this point for already i
could see by the light of a lantern the
crew on the beach of the cave some
distance away olaf was talking to
them as i struck bottom and dripping
like a water spaniel joined them we
took count all were there

  just as i was about to swim off to
the submarine to climb aboard and
arouse jack and tinker a light was
switched on in her conning tower and
a head appeared

  thought i recognized your voice
tom jack called out been listen-
ing here for ten minutes to try to find
what was up

  ask him please sir to turn on the
searchlights and throw them this way
olaf suggested and in a few minutes
the cavern was filled with light

  i stared around me but could see
nothing beyond a small nest of dories
just above the waters edge the two
smugglers who had led us over the
the pular magazine



hills and had been talking to olaf
quickly got some lanterns from places
where t-hey were concealed and led the
way to a second grotto it had casks
of spirits and of perfumes bales of
silk ana merchandise and all sorts of
odd parcels none of which bore a rev-
enue stamp i was doubtful about
some of the casks passing through the
sea foxs hatches but fortunately
she had decks and hatches more or less
on the lake plan of construction and
in but one or two cases was it neces-
sary to broach a package to stow its
contents we worked with a will and
it was to say the least a picturesque
scene like an old painting of buccaneer
days the smugglers planned to trans-
port the entire lot of contraband to an-
other hiding place some few miles up
the main fiord provided we could
effect this worthy task

  all hands were aboard and we sub-
merged then came the trying
strained time when with olaf at the
wheel and the smugglers to assist him
we backed slowly out of the grotto
at a fair depth for a distance took a
greater depth swung cautiously
round and moved forward we had
not even scraped a side so thorough
was the knowledge of the norse
sailors as to depths and directions in
hat arm of the fiord we must have
been thirty fathoms down at the point
where we passed under the patrol boats
that had been sent to apprehend us
and the norskman

  we halted at a place indicated by
olafs friends and cautiously came to
the surface until the periscope exposed
our situation we were fortunate to
find no craft in sight and now ran for
a while awash and standing by to sub-
merge in case of danger the signals
to slow down then to come fully to
the surface then to stop the motors
were gratefully received and i felt the
air through the open ports and hatches
and climbed up to see where we were

  we were actually alongside a wharf
and several fishing boats were fore and
aft of us their masts rocking in the
swell caused by our arrival for all the
world like agitated fowls

 one of olafs countrymen ran
heavily up the beach to a house and
before we could get half the contra-
band out of the sea fox to the wharf
there were a dozen men to assist us
a cask or bale could scarcely touch the
stringers before it was being hurried
away from our sight two rowboats
had pulled out immediately and were
on watch above and below the place
where we were to give the alarm in
case any craft appeared it was like
clockwork and our part was accom-
plished in a surprisingly short time
we bade hurried good-bys sent many
messages to olafs cousin and were
again submerged and headed down-
stream before olaf spoke

  well sir you have saved my cousin
they can get no proof against him
now thank you sir 

  you mean he saved us i retorted
that is so far

  he seemed to consider my reply for
a moment before he replied we shall
get clear the fiord at any rate i
can take her out to sea all right and
after that-its up to you sir

  his phlegm and imperturbability were
admirable there was neither dis-
couragement nor regret in his tone
although he knew as well as i did how
badly our first venture had failed and
how badly we were beaten he may
have conjectured my predicament for
i knew not which way to turn once
we were in the open sea it seemed
a grotesque situation for a ships mas-
ter to be in here we were practically
owners of the most marvelous craft
the world had ever known manned by
a crew that was as competent for its
work as any crew that ever went to
sea fully supplied with everything we
required thanks to olafs cousin and
the phantom u-boat



yet burdened with something that we
must sell if we were to ever profit in
sheer desperation and inability to de-
cide i gave the course when we were
clear of the cape with its fortifications
and the course was to be off into the
unfrequented wtaters of the north sea
routine was on again and the watches

set we were heading to the waters
of nowhere for a breathing space in
which to consider and lay new plans
we were not as well advanced as on
the day we turned our bow toward ber-
gen for now we had made an im-
placable enem out of our natural
market

one christmas

by bertrand w sinclair
author of  landlubbers luck the fiddling kidetc

    by no means a typical sinclair story something quite different its
about a man who worked surrounded by money continually under its in-
fluence money in a sense was the keynote of his existence because he
pondered too long on the possibilities that lay in the dollars he almost
missed a merry christmas

charlie broadstone spent
six hours each working day of
the week within an inclosure of
bronze latticework with money
in bills and gold and silver all about
him it was there in bulky packets and
slender in rolls and piles in drawers
and racks and pigeonholes he was no
i paying teller in the citizens national
bank in a western illinois town-which
for reference purposes may be known
as cornville an alias does not come
amiss now and then to even the most
respectable of towns

  broadstone had practically grown up
in that neighborhood he was thirty
and the citizens national had absorbed
him at the impressionable age of nine-
teen in analytical moments he some-
times reflected that the bank had a
mortgage on his future

  but that thought did not disturb him
in fact a good many thoughts which
have caused other men much uneasi-
ness had never troubled him-up to a
certain point he worked surrounded
by money all his calculations bore
upon money he was continually un-
der the influence of money its power
its visible tokens were forever pass-
ing through his nimble fingers in gold

and in printed certificates money in
a sense was the keynote of his exist-
ence money in its various forms of in-
terest and principal of discount and
loan and overdraft and advance

  yet it had always failed to impress
him as being of such tremendous sig-
nificance  such vital significance as it
seemed to hold for many of those who
daily passed and repassed his wicket
broadstones attitude toward money in
so far as he was consciously aware of
an attitude was of its being so much
material to work with material of a
certain intrinsic value a necessary part
of the machinery of commerce and ex-
change he had ambitions too he
would not have been paying teller in
the citizens national at thirty if he
had lacked the spur of ambition but
he had never looked upon money upon
the folds and packets and piles of cur-
rency that he handled every day in his
bronze cage with the hungry eye and
itching finger of acquisitiveness-not
until he met ada storr

  ada was a home product like himself
only of different strata that is she
had been prior to their acquaintance
but economic pressure in one of its
various manifestations had played hob
one christmas



with adas prospects otherwise
charlie broadstone would scarcely
have had the pleasure of gradually
passing with her from acquaintance to
a state of feeling that commonly afflicts
young people when they reach a certain
degree of intimacy

  they had reached the point of plan-
ning tobe married when his salary jus-
tified such a move one would natu-
rally suppose that the salary of a bank
teller-even the teller in an institution
of no greater scope than the citizens
national of cornville-would be suffi-
cient for matrimonial purposes yet
charlie broadstone could never quite
see miss storr properly fitted in the set-
ting his hundred dollars a month could
provide

  adas father had come a financial
cropper some two years earlier so com-
plete and final a crash that he could
not bear contemplation of the ruins-
and so blew out his brains where-
upon miss storr was swiftly deprived
of comparative affluence found herself
compelled to forego a lot of things
which she had always taken as a mat-
ter of course this unpleasant circum-
stance put her all out of joint with the
social circle in which she had carelessly
gyrated when her father was a prosper-
ous merchant

  being a young woman of some spirit
she did not dissolve in tears and de-
spair pride spurred her to action
through the kindly offices of a friend
she eventually secured a position which
kept her fed and clothed after a
fashion

  but she never ceased to chafe over
things she could not help she con-
tinued to crave all sorts of things which
were now beyond her reach she en-
vied the women who could dress well
she hungered for luxury as a cat hun-
gers for milk it made her discon-
tented spoiled the taste of the simple
pleasures that did come her way the
manner of her upbringing had spoiled

  b p

her for the sort of life she had to lead
a certain standard of living once ac-
quired is hard to let go she wanted
a great many things she could see no
way of getting by her own unaided
efforts marriage she was quite
worldly-wise enough to know offered
the only possible solution but none
of the young men numbered among her
acquaintance were overburdened with
either cash or prospects

  charlie broadstone was the likeliest
of the lot to do ada justice she had
a genuine affection for broadstone a
feeling entirely apart from any consid-
eration of expediency if he had been
a grocery clerk at fifteen dollars per
she might have cared just as much for
him-but she would never have thought
of marrying him even after they
were definitely engaged their marriage
was a distant possibility contingent
upon a substantial increase in his salary
that very uncertainty had a profound
psychological effect upon broadstone
himself

  it never struck him that his pretty
intelligent fiancee laid more stress on
financial ways and means than anything
else so far as his future was con-
cerned he could gauge it accurately
enough it had taken him a year of
apprenticeship and ten years of con-
stant application to work up to a hun-
dred dollars a month it would take
him another ten years to double that
by the time he was forty-five-barring
accidents sickness and so on-he
would be in line for more rapid pro-
motion bigger money he was fairly
certain of that he knew his business
knew how to make himself valuable

  but the prospect of a decent salary
and position by middle age did not
solve his present problem and it was
a problem he wanted solved the
mating instinct had overwhelmed him
when that emotional state sweeps a
man he finds small solace in what is
slated to happen ten or fifteen years

ahead he is wrapped in the now his
soul on fire with it

  so that charlie broadstone while he
was gloriously happy in his love so long
as he could shut everything else out of
his mind was beating his head against
a wall of adamantine facts a good deal
of the time they couldnt marry and
maintain a home on what he got now
ada said so and when broadstone re-
duced it to cold figures he regretfully
agreed they covered sheets of paper
with lists of rent and fuel groceries
and light incidentals they had to
dress they could never quite get a
margin on the right side it simply
couldnt be done on a hundred dollars
a month it could be done in one way
only-they could marry and keep on
working and board but that outraged
broadstones ideal he wanted a home
he wanted his wife to be mistress in
her own house but he did not see how
it could be done

  he knew other fellows who had mar-
ried on a salary equivalent to his
some of them seemed to be contented
enough but there were some whose
menage affected him like a nightmare
worry and bills and children were
chronic even those who appeared
contented enough werent getting on
his own case he always said to him-
self was different ada was different
she had been used to better things
she was entitled to better things that
was how she affected him he even
felt a queer chesty glow that a girl like
her should love him broadstone didnt
rate himself highly he didnt know
what a steady clean-cut likable sort
of a fellow other people generally took
him to be the monthly and yearly
routine of bank work doesnt tend to
give a man an inflated opinion of him-
self--he has to struggle too hard and
too long for every inch of ground he
gains

  and so from a calm indifference to
the currency he handled every day-a

tithe of which would have made every
one of his little air castles take substan-
tial form-broadstone began to hate
the sight of it of the money in bank
notes and coin that surrounded him-
to hate it and resent its insolent flaunt-
ing to want it himself yet he did not
dream of appropriating it to his own
uses it was still a part of the financial
machinery with which he worked the
tools of his craft so to speak only
he saw now more clearly what there
was about it that brought a gleam to
the eyes of those who sometimes gazed
through his wicket it was eminently
desirable indispensable even a mighty
lever in a mans hand

  ada storr furnished him with a new
angle of vision in this particular they
were sitting one evening on the
veranda of the house where she
boarded the arc lights that flashed
along the main streets radiated in all
directions from the upstanding bulk of
the citizens national the bank
loomed over the town just as it loomed
over broadstones career

  its a shame that you handle thou-
sands of dollars every day and cant
have a few hundred when we need it
so badly she murmured cant you
loot the safe charlie

  he laughed a trifle nervously it
jolted him that remark

  i suppose i could he observed
dryly only looting it and getting
away with the loot are two different
matters

  i would if i had a chance she said
snappishly i think a man who robs
a bank should be highly commended
banks are inhuman anyway look
what they did to dad they picked his
bones like a lot of hungry dogs 

  there was a measure of truth in this
as broadstone knew storr senior had
got into deep water and the banks the
citizens national included took ad-
vantage of his situation that sort of
thing however had always appeared

to charlie broadstone as the logical
outcome of poor business judgment-
on the other fellows part it was a
sort of business ethic that was current
the bank a sort of soulless disem-
bodied business force could con-
sistently do things that in an individual
would seem terribly harsh even vin-
dictive that his own bank had
profited largely by storrs ruin had
been a mere incident it did not seem
so purely incidental now why it was
the same as taking her money

  he thought about that the next day
a good many times as he paid out
sheafs of currency his fingers went
about their ordinary duties with me-
chanical precision but his mind ran on
money-the banks money-which he
was handling as a grocer handles beans
and coffee here were thousands upon
thousands in gold and silver and notes
working away silently creating daify
yes hourly new wealth for men who
already had more than they needed
he  recollected that mr murdock-
smythe the chief stockholder had that
very week bought a new limousine
that beardsley the president had
a hundred-thousand-dollar house in
course of construction he could name
a lengthy list of stockholders taking
big dividends as a matter of course
yet he a ten-year slave of this wealth-
creating machine could not command
sufficient pay to give decent surround-
ings to the daughter of a man this very
machine had helped despoil

  a swift surge of vindictive feeling
swept him he hated the citizens na-
tional hated it the more because it
loomed over him arrogant and power-
ful rich impervious to any assault he
could make upon it a veritable colos-
sus embodied in granite and marble
stuffed and garnished with gold

  would it be a crime to rob that
smooth-working inexorable money
mill no he said bitterly only it
couldnt be done

  he took it for granted that no ap-
propriation of bank funds was ever
successfully accomplished-save by the
board of directors still he began to
speculate idly on how it might be done
that money spread yearning arms to
him touched him deeply with its po-
tential power to solve all sorts of diffi-
culties he nursed a vision of ada
storr beautifully gowned a warm
human jewel in the kind of setting
gold would provide when he thought
of her he could almost discount com-
plete defiance of equity of the law as
well as his personal code of honor
there were other phases of even suc-
cessful embezzlement which he could
not discount because his imagination
could not visualize to him clearly the
state and condition of being a fugitive

  this train of thought once set in mo-
tion would not be derailed it kept
running in his mind during his off
hours tantalized him sometimes in his
dreams troubling him most of all when
he stood within his bronze lattice cage
and tens and twenties and hundred-dol-
lar bills passed into their respective as-
sortments through his deft trained fin-
gers

  he went out for a walk with ada
storr one sunday afternoon late in
october he was rather silent pre-
occupied they traversed several
blocks of street and entered a small
park lying a few squares from the
business heart of the town the grass
there was dry withered the leaves
were drifting here and there a yellow
litter on the turf the trees were grow-
ing gaunt of limb standing about like
denuded skeletons since the autumn
winds stripped them of their foliage

  what a dismal place this is getting
to be the girl complained if we
could just be transported to a florida
beach-or somewhere

  broadstone mumbled some monosyl-
labic response she glanced up at his
face


the popular magazine

  what are you thinking about so
hard charlie  she asked

  money he said briefly

  the one thing we need and havent
got she said pensively and cant
get

  i could have got a fair-sized bundle
yesterday he drawled trying to make
his tone seem jocular i could have
walked out of the bank with forty
thousand dollars i had it in my keep-
ing for some little time none of it
would have been missed before mon-
day i could have been two thousand
miles away by then

 forty thousand dollars she
seemed to let the words slip caressingly
off her tongue we could do a lot
with forty thousand dollars but then
of course theyd catch you they al-
ways do dont they 

  nearly always he admitted

  they walked on a little way silently
why dont you devise some way of
doing it so that you couldnt be de-
tected she said at last its no
crime to rob a bank-if you can get
away with it

  would you take a chance with a
man who appropriated funds like that
ada  he asked very soberly

  she looked at him sidelong her fin-
gers tightening on his arm thrilling him
with the quick intensity of the pres-
sure

  fd take a chance on you she whis-
pered could you do it

  yes he answered bluntly ive
figured out how it could be done-suc-
cessfully a man in my position-you
know-has opportunities suppose i
did id have to be very sure of you
you might develop a conscience

  i  about an institution that helped
ruin my father she declared scorn-
fully no im not afraid of tainted
money if we had it enough to live as
we want to live i dont think id worry
about how we came by it i notice
other people dont no i havent any

conscience about money the lack of
it hurts me more directly it drives me
wild if i want to spend one miserable
dollar because i have to scrimp and
save for a week to make up but it
would be terribly risky for you
wouldnt it charlie where would
you go and how would you manage-
afterward 

  i have a plan-ive thought it all
out he said under his breath but
id have to be sure of you ada-very
sure

  you can be charlie she said
eagerly ill go anywhere any time 
do anything you ask anything that
promises the least chance of bettering
ourselves oh you dont know how
sick im getting of this every one i
used to know has drawn into their
shells without money were less than
nothing i work-ive worked steadily
nearly two years how long have you
given all your time and thought for just
about the barest sort of living and
theres nothing else ahead of us we
just exist if we married on your
salary it would be the same scrimp-
ing along eternally managing trying
to make something out of nothing
counting nickels till were gray being
respectable and dull and sordid life
like that isnt worth living

  she looked up at him with a gleam
of admiration in her dark-blue eyes

  i didnt think you were bold enough
to even consider a stroke like that
charlie she went on i didnt do
i surprise you by my readiness to-to
grasp the idea itll be risky

  rather he said very risky one
cant make omelets without breaking
eggs it can be done in fact those
things are easy enough to do the risk
is afterward-getting caught the
bankers association never lets up on
a defaulter still-i dont mean to be
caught ive been thinking im tired
of the treadmill the lack of oppor-
tunity you dont know how tired
one christmas



ive asked for a raise and they just
put me off and i want you ada
im sick of waiting and waiting i
want you to have a chance to live de-
cently to be something more than a
mere penny-counting housekeeper for
me i want to be something more than
a mere minor money-reckoning ma-
chine for other people nothing but
money will get us anywhere theres
only one way for me to get money
and the only difference between my
method and the business method is that
my way will be abrupt and illegal
where theirs is devious and within laws
that have been made to fit their ends
will you do exactly what i tell you
act absolutely as i may find it neces-
sary for you to act ada

  they had reached a comparatively
secluded portion of the park made so
by a thick semi-wild growth of low
thicket they were hidden from all the
surrounding rows of houses the girl
put her arms around his neck kissed
him passionately

 absolutely she whispered try
me and see you know i love you
charlie ill play the game with you
i dont care whether it would stand
ethical consideration or not

  all right he muttered recklessly
ill do it i can

  she kissed him again

  when  she asked breathlessly
and how

  there be a considerable wait he
said grimly im not going to make
any false motions i know the ropes
you see the best time will be at
christmas-less than three months as
to how i dont think ill tell even you
that not now at any rate when im
ready ill make a clean-up -thats
all i have a plan in mind that will put
any pursuit all up in the air when
the time comes ill coach you wrhere
you must go and what you must do
we will of course have to get clean
out of this country other bank de-

faulters have made errors i dont intend
to make

   they moved along debouching
 from the park adas fingers released
 that clinging grip on his arm

   wont it be fine charlie she
 mused a new country you and i
 together money in our pockets

   broadstone nodded his expression
 did not perceptibly change and he
 scarcely spoke a dozen sentences as
 they walked to ada storrs boarding
 place she had promised to play the
 piano for some aspiring vocalist at
 four-thirty

   broadstone left her at the door
 when he set off down the street he
 walked slowly for half a dozen blocks
 an absently thoughtful look upon his
 face

    then all at once he squared his shoul-
 ders defiantly and drew a long breath
 like a man who has definitely accepted
 some sort of challenge

ii

   after all it was remarkably simple

   the moment for which charlie
 broadstone had patiently waited and
 planned wtith an eye to every contin-
 gency came on a friday afternoon at
 closing time saturday was christmas
 the citizens national would stand
 hushed and inactive behind its locked
 doors until monday morning he
 would not be there on- monday but
 his absence was properly provided for
 he had deliberately foregone his an-
 nual vacation in september so that he
 could ask for the christmas wreek off
 it had been easr to secure that privi-
 lege

    he felt reasonably sure that the real
 reason of his absence would not be
 discovered until his return was due at
 the worst he could positively count on
 three days start enough-with his
 course as laid out he did not delude
 - himself with the idea that he could get


the vovulficr magazine

easily and quietly out of reach he did
not nurse any false sense of security
he knew that every step he took would
ultimately be traced-but only to a cer-
tain point he proposed to leave a
tolerably plain trail just so far then
vanish completely into thin air he
meant to give the inevitable pursuit a
genuine start in the wrong direction
not so much with the purpose of elud-
ing it as of baffling it altogether he
had worked out every detail of this
to a nicety he felt very sanguine

  and so two hours after the bank
closed its doors for the day charlie
broadstone walked down the broad
granite steps between the polished
marble pillars of the facade with thirty
thousand dollars of the citizens na-
tional funds concealed about his per-
son

  a ledger keeper and one of the other
tellers came out with him the other
teller boarded in the same house
roomed across the hall from broad-
stone they walked home together
broadstone had his grip packed he
was ready as soon as he changed his
clothes an hour later shortly before
the dinner bell rang he rapped at his
fellow tellers door wished him the joys
of the season gave him a cigar and
suit case in hand went off downstairs
whistling

  as he strode down the street which
led to the station he found himself all
at once coping with a peculiar sense of
unreality he could not rid himself of
the feeling that he was after all simply
on a weeks vacation that the new
year would find him traversing the
same street nodding to people he knew
as he was doing now on every block
that he would be returning to the in-
terminable round in his bronze cage
only the cold finger of his reason
pointed out that if he ever walked that
street again it would be as a prisoner
a fugitive returning in the toils of the
law he shuddered involuntarily when

he remembered that the county jail and
courthouse lay at otie end of that long
avenue the railway station at the other

  he quickened his steps a little the
packages of bills stowed in various
pockets became swiftly a well-nigh in-
tolerable burden the people he met
seemed to look at him with more than
ordinary keenness that he said to
himself testily were nerves imagina-
tion running amuck but it disturbed
him

  another unreckoned factor disturbed
him also now that the thing was done
now that it was too late to reconsider
to draw back he looked about him at
this place where he had spent all his
years since boyhood with a sort of
numbed regret at leaving it in such a
fashion there had been a fresh fall
of snow that afternoon night had
come with a clearing sky the stars
gleamed in a sky brilliant with frost
vieing with the long rows of arcs that
marked every street bisecting the main
thoroughfare all the shops blazed
with light festooned with evergreens
from distant woods gay with bunting
and colored lanterns thronged with
purchasing laughing folk

  to-morrow there would be sundry
small packages containing simple gifts
arriving at his rooms people would
be dropping in or calling him over the
phone to wish him a merry christmas
at the christmas dinner which had be-
come an annual function with the un-
married members of the bank staff the
fellows would be saying well charlie
broadstones sure missing something
to-night just as they always said
about an absent member yes there
were many things it cost him a pang
to leave he knew that now won-
dered why he had never felt that way
about it before why the place and the
people thereof should suddenly have
become such an important factor why
he should recall friendships that he
valued good opinions he esteemed
one christmas



when he turned on the coach step for
a backward glance at the streets it
seemed incredible that he should never
come back again that in a week or less
he would be the scandalized talk of
the town an embezzler a thief

  he shivered again when he found
a seat in the coach and sat down there
was a thin film of sweat gathering on
his temples

  he had a ticket to a town which in-
deed lacked little of being a city some
seventy miles distant ada storr was
waiting for him there it was part of
his plan that they should divide the
loot and while she took refuge upon
the pacific coast he should put his
pursuit-misleading scheme into effect
ultimately he would make his way to
a distant point in northwestern canada
and when he was settled there she
would join him it had all been
weighed and worked out in his mind
with every care for details

  that was broadstones trouble a
mind for details and the imagination
which would not permit one to escape
him once his mind began to concentrate
upon any given problem now that
the last irrevocable step was taken a
new angle of vision seemed to have
been bestowed upon him in which a
variety of distressing details all related
to the environment from which he was
lawlessly departing nagged at him in-
sistently

  but the thing was now an accom-
plished fact by an effort he shook
off the retrospective mood tried to
dwell on what lay ahead in sheer self-
defense against those too vivid back-
ward glimpses which assailed him in a
manner he had failed to anticipate he
had expected to leave that all behind
gladly-in a glow of reckless self-satis-
faction-to go away with the feeling
that thirty thousand dollars and ada
storr was a dual prize worth going any
length to secure

  he reached his destination in about

three hours he walked a certain dis-
tance uptown mingling with a festive
crowd bent on cnristmas shopping
turning into a cross street two blocks
westward along this brought him to a
hotel he registered under an assumed
name was assigned a room

  a casual glance over the previous
days arrivals on the register told
broadstone all he desired to know ada
storr was there likewise under an as-
sumed name according to-their mutual
plan a bell boy showed him to his
room ten minutes later noting that
the hallways were clear he mounted
to the next floor and tapped at the
door of no  it opened at his sig-
nal and he slipped in

  the thought struck him disagreeably
that already his every movement was
becoming furtive for a criminal
broadstone was handicapped with too
ready a spirit of self-consciousness
he had never been aware of it until
now he had not expected to be har-
assed by a sense of guilt to come
under the shadow of constant appre-
hension of a dumb useless regret

  some similar psychological change
seemed to have overtaken ada storr
broadstone saw that almost as soon as
he entered the room she closed the
door quickly behind him the win-
dow shades were drawn her nor-
mally exuberant expression had
changed to strained soberness but
there was something else behind that
tenseness a subtle something that
broadstone could not name-not at
first she kissed him clung to him as
if he were some sort of refuge there
was nothing lacking in the warm eager-
ness with which she flew to his arms
they stood holding each other close
for a minute then with a sigh the
girls arms relaxed she sank into a
chair brushing back a vagrant lock of
her thick blond hair with a weary mo-
tion broadstone seated himself facing
her her eyes purple-black in the


the popular magazine

glow of the chandelier never left his
face

  did you she asked in a strained
whisper did you-

  yes he answered in the same
hushed furtive tone i got thirty
thousand dollars

  she hid her face in her hands
broadstone scarcely seemed to notice
her action he plunged his hand into
an inner pocket and took out a thick
sheaf of united states gold certificates
drew a like packet from another place
about his person they were all in bills
of large denomination

  heres some of it he said money
to burn more money than i could get
hold of in thirty years of salary earn-
ing

  there was no life in his tone no
note of achievement he made the
statement as if it were a rather com-
monplace and uninteresting fact

  he looked up from the packages of
bank notes and saw that ada storr was
crying he stared with troubled eyes
at the quiver of her shoulders the
silent heave of her breast the clenched
hands pressed tight to her mouth

  he moved his chair over and put his
arms about her

  why ada he said i thought
youd be glad whats the matter
are you afraid theres nothing to
be afraid of not yet at least

  she struggled with herself for a min-
ute or so when she regained a meas-
ure of composure she drew his face
down and kissed it tenderly then she
began to speak

  im not afraid she said not in
the way you mean im-im simply-
oh i dont know how to put it since
i came here yesterday and sat here
waiting for you ive done nothing but
think think till my head is spinning
out of it all two or three things seem
to stand very clear ive been a fool
-worse than a fool-and my folly has
got you in a position that gets more

terrifying the more i look at it
charlie charlie i wish you hadnt
taken that money i wish we didnt
have to run away i wish-oh my

dear i wish-

  something choked her and she laid
her tear-wet face against his coat and
her fingers shut down on his arms with
a convulsive grip

  broadstone gulped

  funny he said hoarsely ive been
wishing that myself yes i might as
well admit that when i looked back at
that old burg to-night and thought of
what theyd be saying in a week or two
why money no amount of money
seemed such a vitally important thing
it isnt she whispered plaintively
it isnt i never knew it before you
know i love you charlie id go any-
where do anything to prove that but
i couldnt foresee this ive resented
being poor rebelled against lack of
money ive never tried to make the
best of anything ive been whining
for things that require money ive
been so selfishly envious and ive
harped on it so much that its poisoned
your mind as wtell as my own this
thing which seems so terrible now is
all my fault and youll be punished
for it youve uprooted your whole
life after a while-even if the law
never touches you-youll hate me for
that weve made a ghastly mistake
if we realize it now what will it be like
after a while

  broadstone stroked her hair for a
minute staring soberly at the opposite
wall

  whatll we do ada  he said pres-
ently weve got to make our choice
in an hour i can make a go of what
ive started out to do i feel sure of
that i dont think ill ever be caught

on the other hand-

   yes she filled in the pause

  on the other hand if i could get
back to where i was as little as five
hours ago he said wistfully id feel
one christmas



like a man who has rolled a mountain
off his back i dont know why ex-
actly its just a feeling i planned
this thing deliberately enough but now
ive done it it doesnt sit well on my
stomach i wasnt cut out to be a
thief

  the girl shuddered

  lets go back charlie she whis-
pered couldnt you get that money
back into the bank before its missed
broadstone thought a minute

  i might he said gravely

  do then she urged you dont
want it i dont want it why id
rather face anything than the price
wed have to pay for that money
weve been a pair of fools lets stop
before our folly ruins us completely
and suppose i fail he continued
quietly it wont be so easy to return
that money as it was to take it id
be kicked out of the bank at the very
least if they find out what ive tried
to do id be an empty-handed failure
with a black mark against me

  not to me you wont she said and
her arms tightened about him ive
had my little lesson and its burned in
deep if you are lucky you can put
back that money and well draw a fresh
breath and go on with our eyes open
to a few realities that i at least have
not been able to see before if not-
well well have each other we can
manage somehow

  all right he said with a sudden
almost incredible sense of relief
lets go back lets take the next
train back

iii

  it lacked a little of midnight when
their train flashed out of a belt of low
timber and gave them a glimpse of the
town lights with the outstanding bulk
of the citizens national limned sharp
against the sky with rows of incan-
descent lamps a riot of illumination re-
served for special occasions five min-

utes later they were hurrying from the
depot to catch a street car encounter-
ing on the way a few belated shop-
pers who knew them both these flung
a cheery greeting as they passed

  the girls hand stole into broad-
stones when they sank into a seat

  if we could only have seen it so
clearly before she whispered after
all this place is home theres a lot
here that we didnt realize charlie
ive been so selfish and blind and every-
thing-a thoroughly discontented pen-
dulum and i infected you with my
madness i dont see how you can for-
give me charlie

  i was just as much to blame as
you he muttered i didnt have to
do this crazy thing i should have
known i couldnt do a thing like that
and be able to look myself in the face
again still a man can kid himself
into almost anything if he broods over
it long enough i lost sight of every-
thing but that insane craving for a
bunch of money until i actually had
it in my possession i didnt seem to
have any clear idea of what taking it
in that way really meant i suppose
thats what they mean by a mans moral
vision getting out of focus

  if you can just put it back she
whispered uneasily and remember it
as a bad dream

  i think i can he replied

  they did not speak again until they
were on the steps of adas boarding
house they lingered a minute in the
frosty winter night looking at each
other with the tenderness of mutual
understanding

  youll let me know as soon-as
soon---

  he nodded

  if things go wrong at least ill
know i tried to make it right he said
huskily

  if they go wrong she returned
softly well manage somehow-the
two of us-together
	the popular magazine

  youre a brick ada he said

  then he kissed her and walked rap-
idly up the street the hard-packed snow
creaking under his feet

  he gained his room without encoun-
tering any one and went to bed with
the packets of bills tucked safely under
his mattress but he did not sleep his
mind was too preternaturally active his
nerves too terribly taut the more he
thought about it the more sickening
the reaction grew that money burned
him with its nearness the sense of
wrongful possession made him cringe
over and over he repeated to himself
that he must have been completely mad
and from that his mind would fly
to the means of restoring the stolen
money to the vault of the citizens na-
tional without betraying himself that
done he could breathe freely again-
and not till then

  he fell into a period of troubled doz-
ing at last and waked from one o
these short stretches of slumber to find
the dawn of christmas day at hand

  peace on earth good will to men--
oh lord he groaned everybody
else will be celebrating and ill be
sweating blood till monday morning

  that thirty thousand dollars rode
him like some horrid nightmare he
sensed disastrous possibilities of losing
it or a part of it he dared not leave
that pile of currency in his room he
was equally reluctant to stir abroad
with it on his person so he did not
get up even when the bell rang for a
late breakfast

  but he could not spend all of the
next twenty-four hours within the four
walls of his room he would gladly
have done so if in his hypersensitive
state of mind he had not feared that
might cause comment suspicion so
he mastered the blue funk that was
overcoming him dressed and spent the
time between that and dinner listening
to some of his fellow boarders enthuse

over a christmas eve dance they had
attended broadstone casually ac-
counted for his speedy return by say-
ing he had been disappointed in his
arrangements not without a keen sense
of the subtle irony of this statement
he had to make some sort of explana-
tion because in that house where he
had sojourned nearly four years they
were like a family with a brotherly
and sisterly interest not to say in-
quisitiveness in each others affairs

  he was thankful that he did not have
to take his christmas dinner with the
members of the bank staff the board-
ing-house dinner was an ample old-
fashioned affair that would have been
wholly enjoyable if broadstones mind
had been at ease he could not help
a lot of dumb regrets nor stave off
recurring inward tremors his will
was never quite powerful enough to
shut off sight of the precipice along
which he strode

  but the day somehow came to an
end

  after his coffee and rolls next morn-
ing he set out for the bank every
nerve in his body seemed under a pain-
ful tension when he passed up those
polished granite steps outwardly he
wore a purely casual air his habitual
pleasant smile he did not allow the
hunted harassed feeling to show in his
demeanor a psychologist observing
him critically might have guessed
something amiss but the staff of the
citizens national was not given to
psychological study-save in the case
of applicants for advances upon doubt-
ful paper or undue extension of credit
broadstone was like caesars wife
wholly above suspicion his fellow
workers had too many pressing tasks
ahead of them for more than a belated
christmas greeting

  to the cashier he made the same ex-
planation he gave at his boarding place

  thank the lord that gentleman
exclaimed i wont have to make any
one christmas



shifts we could use more help this
week at that

  so now for broadstone the su-
preme moment was at hand the vault
was opened his usual routine pres-
ently took him there he emerged
from the vault returned to his bronze
lattice cage with his days cash he
could feel upon his body a clammy
sweat slowly gathering the reaction
made him dizzy the packets of gold
certificate rested now in approximately
the position from which they had
originally been abstracted broad-
stones accounts had in nowise been
tampered with from every angle he
was now absolutely secure

  fortune had favored him in the be-
ginning her smile seemed still to rest
upon him benignantly in the conclu-
sion of this extraordinary undertak-
ing

  he found his hands tremulous and
uncertain as he set about arranging for
the work that would fall upon him with
the opening of the banks doors but
to offset that minor physical disturb-
ance he felt something of that same
profound soul-satisfying relief which
must attend a man who receives an un-
conditional pardon when his feet are
already on the scaffold

  broadstone went home to lunch
going to his room after the meal he

found upon his dresser where a maid
had laid them after the postmans
morning round three or four letters
one envelope bore the imprint of the
citizens national bank he turned it
over uneasily wondering what it might
contain and noticed that the postmark
bore the date of saturday christmas
eve he tore it open at last with
an odd flutter of his pulse he read

  dear mr broadstone  in appreciation of
ten years faithful and efficient service we
take great pleasure in announcing that after
january ist your salary will be at the rate
of eighteen hundred dollars  per
annum

  wishing you a merry xmas and a happy
new year we remain cordially yours

  broadstone sat on the edge of his
bed gazing at the typewritten lines
reading them over and over he could
scarcely credit it but there the thing
stood in black and white before him

 thats a nundred and fifty a
month he muttered a fifty-per-cent
raise and i-oh i guess pm about
the luckiest guy in this town to-day

 then he clapped on his cap and
rushed downstairs and went striding
hurriedly along the street to use up
the remaining fifteen minutes of his
noon hour in carrying the double tid-
ings of gladness to ada storr

the noon rush for the downtown hasty-
stoking restaurants his shoulders
wide competent aggressive clove a
way for him with little respect for
the comfort of others making for the
wide battery of doors at the broadway
exit there was about him that self-
centered concentration of purpose and
air of genteel bullying which fatuous
manhattan accepts as sure index of
power and success the veiled glare
of latent hostility in his eyes outshoot
of close-barbered chin-even the pursy
upholstery of his pink cheeks-all these
incidentals of the purely physical cried
way for the progress of the mas-
terful one

  he came to one of the dors which
swung inward on massive hinges and
for the fraction of a second he hesi-
tated then one gloveless hand
dropped into a pocket of his overcoat
and produced a handkerchief the
square of fine linen was spread be-
tween pudgy fingers as a veil and thus
with the handkerchief protecting bare
flesh from contamination by the metal
of the door handle the square-shoul-
dered one made his exit into the hurly-
burly of north americas most petted
thoroughfare as his hand fell away

from the door handle the handkerchief
was allowed to flutter away unheeded
on the stiff february wind a new-
sie caught the fluttering white bit and
came galloping after the one who had
dropped it the fascinating picture of
a dime or a quarter filling his mental
retina

  your hank mister he ran along-
side and held it up before the eyes of
the man in the mink-lined coat

  the man cursed take it away
came the growl and the boy faded
abashed into the crowd

  of the scores who followed the big
man through the doors but one aside
from the newsboy noted the incident
of the protective handkerchief-that
one a man in whom perception of un-
considered things was developed to a
passion and to professional acuteness
passing the ordinary the fine dark
eyes of gaspard detournelles-hard
drawn they were under downward-
pointing brows a little like a foxs-
viewed all the world of men as a covert
wherein fat game might be flushed at
the least expected moment therefore
they were preternaturally acquisitive
and they read significance in the most
commonplace incident overlooked by
the herd so in this instance of the
quick requisition of the handkerchief
to protect a fat hand from effluvium
of the masses corroding the handle of

the door the eyes of detournelles read
a hint sufficiently diverting so divert-
ing in fact as to swing him away from
a quondam business engagement and
set him to following a wide brown
strip of mink fur through the press
on the sidewalk

  trailing was absurdly simple he had
but to follow the wake of outraged cit-
izens left behind that blocky dread-
naught of a man who elbowed and
chivvied his course like an all-big-gun
fighting machine on trial triangle a
traffic policeman riding herd on the
stampede of automobiles up and down
the high-walled canon held up a thun-
dering motor truck to permit the gen-
tlemans passing a street sweeper
raised a blunt hand to the vizor of his
helmet for both public servants re-
ward was a gruff how-yuh  suffi-
ciently compensating to judge from
their beaming smiles the object of
these attentions turned down a side
street and into the ornate entrance of
a pay-all-you-have restaurant-one of
those establishments with painted pea-
cocks on the walls wherein the price
of viands is set by the number of golden
eyes in the peacocks tails detour-
nelles following at a discreet distance
came up to the piratical haunt of the
hat boy just as the object of his inter-
est was divested of his hat and over-
coat and had turned into the blue-tiled
washroom as casually as he could
detournelles followed he was just
in time to see an obsequious greek tip
over the edge of one of the basins a
bottle of disinfectant widely adver-
tised in the subway placards a little
spurt of the cleansing fluid into the
contents of the bowl satisfied the blocky
gentleman he laved his hands and
cleansed them on a towel which the
greek whipped out of an oiled paper
jacket

  a dollar bill in the hand of the head
waiter secured for detournelles the
dining place he desired it was just in-

side an alcove and at a point of van-
tage whence the fastidious one he had
followed could be observed from an
angle wholly unobtrusive the acquis-
itive eyes of the trailer were all alight
now with interest and nimble specula-
tion his relish was up to the present
moment purely - a detached one-the
enthusiasm of a connoisseur in human
foibles for a new find but behind the
surface interest that predatory instinct
which made gaspard detournelles the
most valued member of raoul flacks
interesting company of international
crooks-known to the paris surete as
the incomparables--had already begun
to function his imagination could
leap a long way ahead of simple cir-
cumstance and frame eventualities and
possibilities for profit along the oblique
lines of the incomparables professional
activities

  so detournelles studied the broad
shoulders and half profile of the mas-
terful citizen a few tables removed
with a double interest

  that the object of his scrutiny was
petted of the whole mazarin manage-
ment was sufficiently patent also that
the cafe mazarin was more than will-
ing to bend its discipline and culinary
custom to the curious whims of its
wealthy patron it was the first dep-
uty head waiter himself who bent a
slavish ear to take the great mans or-
der  another menial whose touring car
could not have been less than a twin
six brought the silver splendor of cas-
seroled meat and mushrooms sous
cloche the rolls so detournelles
noted were each incased in oiled-paper
pajamas though no such delicacy was
practiced at other tables the waiter
did not menace the cleanliness of the
cutlery by removing it from the tray
with his own hands but held the server
so that the diner himself could lift
knife fork and spoon collection to the
damask all this regimen was done
so as a matter of course as to carry to
the popular magazine

the observer conviction of its having
become custom

  one preliminary to the meal rang a
deep note in detournelles penetration
before he had touched a mouthful of
the food ranged before him the ex-
quisite cleansed knife fork and spoons
by fire one by one he held the sev-
eral accessories in the flame of the al-
cohol lamp beneath the chafing dish
turning them over and over and finally
dipping the heated service implements
in a glass of ice water then followed
discussion of the viands with gusto born
of confidence lie ate largely and with
the same imperious air that marked his
breasting of the crowd detournelles
had to extend his meal with a liqueur
and cigar in order to remain until the
other had finished with almost no
finesse he followed his quarry back
through broadway and up the vaulting
elevator to a high level of the assur-
ance building the door behind which
the trailed one disappeared was one of
an extensive suite and bore on its
ground-glass panel this legend t
stacey crump industrials within
fifteen minutes bradstreets the city
directory and social register had
yielded detournelles much information
concerning t stacey crump what
bradstreets asserted the directory of
directors affirmed with emphasis-he
was one of the biggest fish in all the
wall street pool the social regis-
ter added its discriminating voice as to
mr crumps connections with the shal-
lowbrook hunt his town house and
adirondack lodge each of the mute
character witnesses brought a deeper
gleam to the eyes of detournelles

  at exactly noon next day the french-
man was at the broadway corner of
the cafe mazarin eagerly scanning the
street in the direction of the assurance
building when he saw a mink-lined
overcoat breasting the tide he hurried
into the domain of the peacocks and
by virtue of a tip secured a table a

little to one side and in front of the
one reserved for crump he was giv-
ing his order when the magnate ap-
peared from the washroom and took
his seat detournelles was so placed
that he could not see the object of his
manueverings but knew that he could
be seen of him

  the waiter brought rolls to place be-
side the silver service detournelles
gave them one scornful glance then
turned and fixed the menial with a cold
eye

  that vou should think i would eat
these  he sharply exclaimed bah 
little nests of disease at once bring
me rolls with protective jackets or i
shall seek the management

  overcome with the surprise of the
attack the waiter stumbled away to
return in a few minutes with pajama-
clad rolls such as the fastidious crump
enjoyed detournelles removed one
from its envelope and examined it crit-
ically before proceeding to break off an
end to butter when his meat order
came and with it knives and forks he
gravely inaugurated a most surprising
campaign of preparation

  first from a pocket of his jacket
he produced a miniature atomizer
spraying alcohol he set fire to the tip
of the jet and in the thin fan of blue
flame thus kindled passed back and
forth the blades of the knives and tines
of the forks he heard the clatter of
a fork dropped on a plate at crumps
table followed by a startled grunt of
surprise other eyes than the waiters
were on him detournelles knew by this
token when the table service had all
been sterilized in the alcohol flame he
brought from the breast pocket of his
coat a small vial of colorless fluid-
high-proof cognac it was-poured a
film of this over the heaped-up viands
on his plate and applied a match a
veil of blue flame skipped like marsh
gas over joint and vegetables then
passed to nothingness
virus x



  with a conscious air of satisfaction
detournelles ate his meal topping off
with liqueur and cigar but before he
would put the tip of the perfecto be-
tween his lips he wet it with the liquid
from the vial he smoked at his ease
never turning his head by so much as
an inch though he could feel the gim-
leting of crumps eyes between his
shoulders

  before the first ash was sped a heavy
figure appeared by his side and a throaty
voice hailed him

  excuse me but may i sit down and
talk with you for a while you and i
have a good deal in common de-
tournelles looked lazily up to crumps
face and somewhat distantly indi-
cated with a wave of his hand the op-
posite empty chair the financier
dropped heavily to his seat fumbled
with a cardcase and finally managed
to snare one of his cards between pudgy
fingers this he passed to detournelles
with a formal bow the latter eyed
the engraved script then with a slight
accentuation of his french mode of
speech  and for what msieu crump
this honor

  crump put temporarily at a disad-
vantage by the coolness of his recep-
tion cleared his throat noisily

  well fact is mr-ah-mr-

detournelles made no move to supply
his name fact is i couldnt help
noticing your-hum-precautions you
took about your eating thats a sort
of hobby of mine-germ protection
you know more than a hobby i guess
i might as well admit fm a nut about
it detournelles lifted his eyebrows
ever so slightly at the slang phrase and
the pink deepened in the others super-
latively healthy cheeks he forged on
doggedly

  i said i couldnt help noticing your
little precautions-and they interested
me a whole lot you seem to have it
all over me for science-in the way
you go about sterilizing maybe you

wouldnt mind telling me what that
preparation is you put on your food to
burn off surface germs from the air
a mighty necessary thing that but i
never knew how to do it

  detournelles had allowed his frigid-
ity to thaw materially during the others
halting speech now he beamed upon
crump as one enthusiast upon another
he brought out his cardcase and passed
across the table a cardboard neatly en-
graved 

chev gaspard detournelles

directeur	paris

  we are then fellow soldiers in the
army of preservation msieu crump
detournelles hailed with a gesture of
the hands essentially gallic how
well met in this so-strange country
where men know not the first principles
of bacteriological defense--and die so
miserably by the tens of thousands

you are the first- he left the

sentence pregnant because unfinished

  crump was delighted his native
pugnacity and denial of convention car-
ried him at a bound over all the reserve
of this courteous stranger who made
the battle against the unseen myriads
of the air one of scientific management
instead of the hit-or-miss provision
crump had seized upon the nameless
fear which rode at the financiers elbow
day and night-which in his chimera
of dread made even his pink cheeks
and superlative vitality mockeries in the
face of insidious decay-this found sol-
ace in a lucky meeting such as the
present one he unburdened himself
without reserve

 why chevalier- crumps en-
vious democracy hit upon that handle
with avidity why chevalier i even
leave my shoes in a pan of b o dis-
infectant overnight and when im in
a strange hotel i wont step out of my
bed without night slippers-burn em


the cpopuljr magazine

too rather than put em in my trunk
when im leaving i wont have a
servant whos got the least trace of
dandruff and i use up about a gross
of handkerchiefs a month opening
doors in public places with them-
cheaper than throwing away gloves
never wear gloves anyway since i read
how a man got rabies through a pair
of dogskin gloves of course my lady
wife says im crazy-not crazy enough
to kiss her you bet and ive had to
fire every stenographer ive had when
she gets a cold and sneezes into her
notebooks and theres considerable ex-
pense in having my whole suite of
offices washed with b o once a week
but-i keep my health and thats the
main thing

  the director of the institut bac-
teriologique listened with warm cour-
tesy to the financiers recital of his
many precautions but he was evasive
under direct questioning concerning his
own system of defense against the ever-
present germ particularly as to the
mission of the parisian institute ever
which he had charge some day he
vouched tantalizingly as they rose to
go some day perhaps we can inter-
est you in our system of permanent
self-sterilization which covers every
point of defense except against the
zymogenic bacteria no no msieu
not a word this is a happy meeting
and we will not intrude business at

another time perhaps-

  detournelles was adamant against the
big mans importunities for an imme-
diate continuance of the chance ac-
quaintance very skillfully he left im-
planted in crumps mind overweening
curiosity and the desire to pursue far-
ther the mastering passion of protec-
tion under the tutelage of the scientist
from the institut

  right soon msieu crump when i
find the time in my so-pressing duties
i will meet you here for luncheon
was detournelles parting promise

let us hope nothing-no triumph of
the enemy-will prevent

  it was ten days after the encounter
in the mazarin that detournelles kept
a dinner engagement with t stacey
crump which he had reluctantly per-
mitted to be forced upon him at a sec-
ond meeting over the table in the down-
town restaurant the meal was served
with all the quiet niceties that make
the salamis club a place of comforts
for crump the softly shaded candles
on the table but lit the way to a larger
and more wonderful prospect for the
director of the institut bacteriologique
had promised that this night he would
take his host for a visit of inspection
to the branch of the paris laboratory
which he recently had opened in new
york-a small and modest beginning
of our work in america but an out-
post my dear msieu crump of our
army of preservation over there

  for gaspard detournelles as for his
precious associates in raoul flacks
little company of expert criminals
these ten days between meetings with
the financier had been crammed with
high-tension activity not the least
portion of this period of preparation
had been spent by detournelles among
the dry-as-dust accumulation of tomes
in that obscure room of the great li-
brary on fifth avenue which has
pathology inscribed over its door
the nimble wits of the man had leaped
to the exigencies of the occasion and
from the many scientific works he
skimmed he had culled an engaging line
of patter this he doled out to his din-
ner companion in homeopathic doses-
a word here a phrase there before
the cigars were finished and crumps
limousine trundled up to the club door
detournelles had more than ever es-
tablished himself in character

it was on the frenchmans sugges-
vius x



tion artfully put that the auto depos-
ited them at a corner of the broad ave-
nue flanking central park on the west
they would have a brief walk in the
park dear msieu crump and himself
would so as to fill their lungs with
the fresh night air after the confine-
ment of the limousine detournelles
had no wish that the location of the
institut should be known to any other
than the big man his companion
crump did not even notice the illumi-
nated sign at the corner of the street
down which they turned after five min-
utes brisk walk under the gaunt limbs
of the parks winter wilderness

  one of a long row of brownstone
fronts all similar in design was their
destination a girl in nurses starched
cap and apron-a girl with a sweet de-
mure beauty of level eyes and broad
brow-opened the door at detournelles
ring ah mamselle nan the
frenchman murmured the reception
room for this gentleman please and
request doctor flacks attendance there
if he is not engaged saying which
he bowed his apology and disappeared
down the dim hall

  without aword nan madden-the
nan madden of the studio and the
phonograph plot that came so near ruin-
ing the great tenor engwald-led the
short way to a room on the right of
the hall and at the door bowed the
visitor in with a curt little nod wholly
impersonal the door closed behind
crump he was alone in the strangest
room he had ever seen bare it was
to the limit of monkishness and more
than monastic the severity of the few
pieces of furniture therein walls were
shining white reflecting dazzlingly the
cold light from the incandescent cluster
depending from the ceiling instead of
the property sofa center table and
leather-backed chairs of the usual
physicians consultation room here
were only a settee and two chairs all
of steel even to the thin mesh webbed

  nb p

  across seat and back-steel painted an
uncompromising and ultra-sterilized
white white too was the floor cover-
ing of some rubberoid substance

  but compelling focus of attention
was the glistening steel boiler head of
some strangely fashioned engine which
stood on spindling steel legs in a cor-
ner somewhere within its mysterious
vitals hidden fires whether of electric-
ity or alcohol were burning a sighing
murmur and whispering of imprisoned
steam came intermittently from secret
vents and out of a thin tube rising
above the boiler was disseminated a
grayish vapor it must have been the
vapor that filled the room with that
pungent medicinally clean odor

  crump had come to detournelles
outpost of preservation with imagina-
tion fired and every faculty of his
chronic aberration on the qui vive but
this startling engineer of germ destruc-
tion-this white and steel room with
the lisping whisper of medicated steam
making its dead walls vocal-he was
hardly prepared for such extremity of
precaution alone as he was all the
delicious dread that assails the neophyte
in the anteroom of the lodge was his
a great sense of peace also settled over
him here was one place in all new
york where the ever-present germ
could not get at him

  the big man of wall street had only
the vapor generator for companion dur-
ing ten pregnant minutes-so nicely did
raoul flack time the necessities of
psychological reaction then the door
opened and two spectral figures en-
tered both wore the gaberdine of the
operating room dropping below their
knees and hooding their heads their
faces were partially masked by stiff
gauze respirators it was detournelles
who raised a rubber-gloved hand and
unmasked himself his companion-a
diminutive figure somehow conveying
the aspect of age even through the
gaberdine-following suit


the popular magazine

  pardon the delay msieu crump
detournelles purred a little visit to
our patients in company with doctor
flack here doctor flack my good
friend msieu t stacey crump of
whose great name in the field of finance
you will hear when you have been
longer in this country

  crump rose and extended his hand
the face he saw under the sagging edge
of the cowl was one to remember long
just two deep-set and age-old eyes in
the hollows of shadowed sockets
scraggy cheek bones and a mouth that
was a blue-white line that was the face
the eyes dominated every other fea-
ture they were so cold and absolute
knowledge seemed to be stored in the
depths of their irises like treasure in
steel-ribbed vaults doctor flack ac-
knowledged the introduction with pro-
fessional curtness

  msieu crump is one who in his
own way-maybe a somewhat imper-
fect way but nevertheless praiseworthy
-has been trying to avoid the perils
of the unseen enemy detournelles was
saying i have consented to bring him
to our little isle of safety here my dear
doctor that he may see how far science
has progressed along the lines of his
endeavor will you be good enough to
explain our method

  they seated themselves on the steel-
woven mesh the phantom pushed back
the cowl from his surprising head of
dead-white hair and began in mark-
edly imperfect english an exposition
of the detournelles system of immuni-
zation against all virulent bacteria save
the zymogenic-naive exception  he
told of the inoculation with virus x
-that remarkable blanket policy against
the risks of voracious animalcuke from
anthrax to yellow jack of the period
of inculbation spent necessarily in com-
plete quiet the rise in temperature ac-
companied by occasional delusional
symptoms and the final rapid convales-
cence out of which the patient emerged

a veritable samson in the germ world
during flacks disclosures detournelles
with an air of translating the profundi-
ties for laymans comprehension threw
in a word here and there in the end
crump persuaded himself that he un-
derstood thoroughly

  and now msieu crump for the
visual demonstration-so far as circum-
stances permit detournelles mur-
mured and he led the way out of the
room and up a flight of stairs crump
followed trembling with eagerness for
the final revelation they passed down
a dark hall toward a distant square of
light shining out against an opposite
wall in this block of radiance they
stopped crump saw that it came
through a square panel of plate glass
set in a closed door he dared look
through

  what he saw was sufficiently impres-
sive  a bare white-walled room such
as the one they had just quitted and
made dazzling by the cold light of in-
candescents on an iron cot against
the far wall opposite the panel lay the
passive form of a man head bandaged
in white a hooded figure in white
gaberdine was just turning away from
the cot as crump looked through the
glass she saw the faces at the panel
and nodded brightly it was mam-
selle nan the pretty nurse who had
admitted the visitor at the front door

  ah breathed detournelles as the
girl inside made some quick gesture
with her hand she says temperature is
down doctor which is as should be
we do not take you into this room my
dear msieu crump for a simple rea-
son it is our desire to protect our
patients as greatly as possible against
outside contamination during the period
of incubation we ourselves and the
nurse go in only when absolutely nec-
essary and then only after complete
sterilization the sterilizer you will
see in the corner msieu crump-he
pointed to a vapor engine similar to
virus x



the one in the reception room below--
that makes of this room a veritable
germ desert no spirilla live in its at-
mosphere

  is it painful this period of incu-
bation after inoculation with virus
x crump whispered

  pah snorted doctor flack a
fever for a few days the-the-what
you call it-night horse-nightmare
perhaps one or a few and then-the
resistant man

  crump made his decision on the way
downstairs to the reception room it
was made quickly as were all his de-
cisions

  i want to come here and take your
treatment he announced when can
i come and how long will it take
doctor flack humped his shoulders
doubtfully and looked to detournelles
as if passing judgment on the accept-
ance of crumps offer up to higher
authority the latter smiled dryly

  we are not at all sure we desire
you for a patient msieu crump de-
tournelles said you are a man-how
shall i call it-masterful you would
not be amenable to necessary discipline
moreover because of professional rea-
sons we desire to work ever so quietly
in this our beginning in america you
would have to come to us secretly not
even your closest associate could know
of your coming not even your wife
so jealous are we of the robber physi-
cians who will pattern after our proc-
esses so soon as they learn them so
you see our position

  detournelles played his card
shrewdly knowing that the least sign
of opposition would but whet the de-
termination of this two-handed juggler
of the financial balls to have his way
slowly the director of the institut bac-
teriologique yielded under pressure
giving a point reluctantly and combat-
ing another with vim at last crump
triumphed

   ill be here at nine to-morrow night

without baggage as you say he af-
firmed as he rose to go and ill
bring a certified check in blank at your
suggestion we can decide on the figure
to fill in any time-and itll be a big
one ill promise you that

  my children said raoul flack the
phantom when they were all gathered
about a bottle of excellent vintage-
even the patient who was henri the
diamond setter there with his swathed
head and nightgown-my children i
am inclined to agree with msieu
crumps statement that the figure on
that certified check will be a large one

  boylan-roger boylan the detective
without frills-was called into the case
of the disappearance of t stacey
crump through the intervention of his
good friend edgerton miles stock-
broker for whom he had once solved
the mystery of the substituted sapphire
collarr this was three days after
crump had left his home on upper mad-
ison avenue on a night after dinner
telling his wife he was going to the
salamis club to keep a business ap-
pointment with a customer crump had
stepped out of his front door and out
of the world as completely as if by
some magic the force of gravity had
been cut from under his feet and he
had soared into stellar space to become
a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound comet

  it was in miles office boylan met
mrs crump for a preliminary consulta-
tion to miles as a close friend and
business associate of her husband the
distracted lady of the missing financier
had gone in her extremity the calling
in of the detective had followed boy-
lan came to the meeting in his rosy-
cheeked and square-toed simplicity
from the flat top of his brown derby to
the sleasy strings of his bulldogs every
inch a master plumber or ward captain
--anything but the confidential solver


the popular magazine

of societys delicate problems the
slightly overdressed and delicately florid
widow in posse made no effort to con-
ceal the disappointment of her anticipa-
tions she bored boylan through and
through with the stabbing of her gold-
mounted monocle injuring the victim
not a whit

  miles took upon himself the task of
outlining the facts of crumps disap-
pearance  the jovial giant took occasion
more than once during the recital to
slip in a ponderous wink unobserved by
mrs crump as if to say that he the
wise one could reveal privately a great
deal appertaining to the mystery boy-
lan listened with his round head cocked
on one side in his characteristic bird-
like posture of alert receptivity

  you say your husband took no bag-
gage with him mrs crump-sent none
away from the house in advance of his
disappearance the detective asked
when he had all of miles facts

  not even his bedroom slippers the
lady answered definitively and that
shows he wasnt planning to be away
from home for without his bedroom
slippers hes helpless as a turtle on its
back

  helpless boylan echoed

  positively t stacey wont get out
of a strange bed without slipping his
feet into bedroom slippers so as not to
pick up germs off an unknown carpet
again the illuminating wink from
miles semaphored from behind mrs
crumps shoulder

  i suppose-um-mr crump left his
business affairs in proper shape boy-
lan hazarded

  so far as they affect me yes said
the lady with a significant tightening
of the lips i know nothing about his
business except the regular payment of
my income

  boylan seemed lost in thought for a
minute or more then put a question
with a shading of deference in his
voice

  mr crump-has he any hobbies
any peculiarities of thought or conduct
that might bear on this case mrs
crump bridled at the instant

  peculiarities  i should say as
much for one he hasnt kissed me in
twelve years and id call that a peculi-
arity hes afraid id poison him with
some germ he wont sit down in a
chair a caller has used until its dusted
and fumigated he makes the second
maid wash titbits-thats my per-
sian-once a day in b o and every
servant in the house must wear rubber
gloves except in their sleep

  when she had taken her leave miles
rejoined boylan his face all broken
into humorous wrinkles

  germs in the germea he boomed
thats whats the matter with friend
crump and it seems to have sort o
struck in on his ladys wifely affection
as it were but seriously crump is
the shrewdest trader south of maiden
lane and balanced like a top except on
this one subject of the little wigglers
in the air and water and food you
dont suppose little wigglers have any-
thing to do with his disappearance

  not unless- by the way does

this crump talk to anybody about his
dread of germs would he be likely
to fall in the way of some faker whod
scare him to death for money

  tries his best to conceal his bug
from his associates miles assured
eats alone at the cafe mazarin sos
nobodyll see him toast his table tools
in the chafing-dish flame wont drink
at a bar because he refuses to swallow
anything thats had ice in it or near it
thats how he dodges publicity on the
nut stuff

  looks to me as if wed find t
stacey crump dangling somewhere on
the tail feathers of a large he-bacillus
just the same boylan mused youll
hear from me-when theres something
to hear

  he went from miles office to

crumps in the assurance building
patience was with roger boylan no
more a virtue than breathing it was
obvious late that night he came upon
the first clew to the disappearance of
t stacey crump that was after he
had sat for five hours going over a
bale of waste paper the collections of

  t stacey crump eased his two hun-
dred and fifty pounds of superlatively
vital bone and sinew between sheets
and offered his plump pink arm to the
ministrations of doctor flack the lat-
ter was swathed in his cowled gaber-
dine from the shadow about his face
his inscrutable eyes appeared to glow
with a light all their own behind him
hovered detournelles and nan mad-
den the pretty nurse both similarly
garbed in grave cerements the
woman held a metal tray from which
came the limpid glow of lights on some
liquid in a glass receiver and the sharp
sheen of metal instruments flack
turned to the tray dipped gauze in
the liquid and thoroughly sponged a
surface of several square inches on
crumps arm then he straightened-
up lifted a silver-and-glass hypodermic
needle from the tray and holding it
up to the cluster of incandescents in

the ceiling observed it with a critical
professional air

  msieu is quite sure he wishes to
proceed with the inoculation these
were the first words spoken in almost
ten minutes of quiet they were given
with the gravity of a death sentence

  sure but dont make such a funeral
of it doc crump answered with
forced levity nevertheless one cor-
ner of his mouth sagged under a sharp
tug of fear and his eyes roved from
shrouded face to shrouded face

  flack lifted from the tray a test tube
stoppled with a dab of cotton removed
the woolly plug and inserted the hypo-
dermic needle in the thick yellow fluid
which half filled the glass tube as
he drew back the plunger crumps eyes
followed the flow of the viscid stuff up
into the glass barrel of the instrument
almost before he was prepared for it
flack had pinched a roll of flesh in
crumps arm and he felt the stab of
a sharp point he grunted

  you now have in your veins some-
thing over three millions of active ba-
cilli the phantom was saying in a
voice dry as the rustling of dead leaves
in an hour-perhaps two-the phe-
nomenon of symptoms makes itself to
appear a temperature rising headache
perhaps unpleasant visions but be un-
disturbed that is as nothing above
all things msieu crump quiet-quiet
do not rise from your bed the touch
of your bare feet on the floor-ah that
would be unfortunate

  but dont i get a pair of bedroom
slippers crump whined

  decidedly not was the phantoms
answer and without another word the
three sheeted figures passed out of the
glass-paneled door crump was alone

  he lay for a long time his eyes on
the three cold bulbs of light against the
shining white ceiling every mental
faculty was concentrated on a little
burning spot on his left arm-the place
where the needle had pricked

  his mind came back to the glazed
walls of the room roved over them in-
curiously now he was conscious of
the presence of that engine-a lisp-
ing sigh and whisper bubbling bub-
bling interminably by turning his
head sharply he could see the thing over
in a corner-the polished steel belly of
its boiler and the prim tube rising over
all to spout gray vapor the smell of
its disgorgings was abominable even
though germ fatal crttmp wondered
if there was a chance of suffocation
where ventilation of the room was pro-
vided-he saw no openings in the walls
and sealed windows

  by and by another sound slowly
forced its way through the bubbling
of the vapor engine with quiet insist-
ence he was several minutes identi-
fying it finally recognized it as a
clocks ticking

  how long since the injection of the
virus x was it an hour no it
couldnt be all of that but-

  thereafter hardly five minutes
passed without a painful sighting of
the clock face by the patient he
counted the ticks-sixty to the minute
three hundred every five minutes that
would be three thousand six hundred
in an hour the doc had said that in
an hour or maybe two something
would begin to happen-fever head-
ache-

  crump counted his pulse finger on
wrist he wished he remembered what
was the normal pulse knew once but
had forgotten seventy something
wasnt it  well his wtas going strong
at eighty-two and wasnt his fore-
head growing hot  it sure was-and
clammy like the walls with the drops
of moisture on them huh those
three million germs were getting in
their work

  then came the headache just a dull
sort of uncomfortable feeling at first
but growing into a pound-pound-
pound like steam riveters at work--

  downstairs in the basement dining
room of the house raoul flack the
phantom was compounding a salad for
the midnight meal about the table
were detournelles henri the diamond
setter and nan madden the girl
alone seemed to lack the zest of gayety
that held the others to quip and laugh-
ter perhaps she was too recently come
as a recruit for the incomparables from
the world of dubious probity that had
been hers the phantom balanced a
cruet of olive oil over a spoon and let
the thick yellow liquor flow out

  behold my children he chuckled
the all-powerful virus x which we
are about to take rashly into our stom-
achs and the effects of which our guest
upstairs is now doubtless enjoying ah
my children the psychology of sugges-
tion is a most fascinating study had
i used plain water instead of olive
oil in the hypodermic the effect would
have been the same rise in tempera-
ture after one hour headache-and
visions yes yes when we have fin-
ished our little dejeuner we will have
to arrange for the visions they are
most important

v

 some time-crump did not know
when nor care for his headache was
raging-the three bulbs of light on the
ceiling flicked out the room was sooty
black not a ray of light anywhere in
the dark the whisper of the sterilizing
engine grew slowly to the roar of a
freight train that clock overhead was
a pile driver smashing on metal-capped
timbers but time ceased with the dy-
ing of the light no longer could he
screw his head around and trace the
jump of the minute hand from station
to station the throbbing in his brain
came to be synchronized with the ham-
mering of the clock-bang-bang-
bang sixty times to the minute three
hundred in five minutes

  maybe his brain had become a clock

  if he could only shut off that infernal
engine and save himself from stran-
gling in its fumes supposing some-
thing should go wrong with it and it
should race then the breath would
be shut out of him slowly-slowly
why didnt they have a bell rigged up
by the bed so he could summon that
little cockroach of a doctor in the
name of all reason why hadnt they left
him a pair of bedroom slippers so he
could step to the door-if he could find
it in the dark-and yell for somebody
to come by george hed go bare-
footed wasnt the floor sufficiently
sterilized

  crump had the covers off and one
foot halfway to the floor when he noted
a slow change in the sooty composition
of the dark it grew imperceptibly
lighter there in the middle of the floor
between the cot and where he thought
the door was-grew lighter but whence
came the dissolving of the dark the
man in bed could not tell he could
only say that there was a growing patch
of light on the floor and a correspond-
ing one equally strong on the ceiling
above now it was light as a star now
had almost the strength of the moon
the patient noted that this was a
cloudy smoky sort of light as if it
were alive within itself he sat up
in bed the better to see this curious
thing

  a cry like a tortured animals leaped
from his lips it bespoke the very
abasement of fear pie fell back but
was dragged up elbow to pillow again
by the hypnotism of horror

  the light was alive-alive with writh-
ing spinning bacilli

  that floor to which he had nearly
set his bared feet was become a ver-
itable serpents nest of loathsome
yeasty things and the ceiling above
crawled with them all vague and dim
of outline they were but endowed with
prodigious life

  blind blobs of jelly squirmed and
twisted through the pale medium of
light single sausage-shaped things
darted hither and thither by the pro-
pulsion of two finlike hairs streaming
from their balloon bodies circular
disks with horrid darker cores for eyes
revolved about one another in a mad
senseless convulsion bodies severed
themselves and became two sentient
things each following a different
course in the winking of an eye

  years of ghastly existence passed
broken to be sure by the most casual
sanity figures in white came and
stood by his bed ministered to him
gave him food they laughed off his
stuttered tales of the dance of the ba-
cilli-said it was the fever that brought
these horrors in one lucid moment
he was propped up in bed and a pen
put in his hand dazedly he signed his
name where directed he signed t
stacey crump to a certified check for
fifty thousand dollars then he was
left alone-utterly alone in an echoing
house

  methodical as the rounds of clock
hands and as sure was roger boylans
pursuit of the trail opened by the dis-
covery of that bit of pasteboard in the
waste bins of the assurance building
first he visited a physician and from
him gleaned information concerning
that particular phobia-rare enough in
medical jurisprudence-which drives its
victims to the elaborate precautions that
were crumps the doctor gave the
detective a list of the supply houses in
the greater city which furnish labora-
tory equipment and the paraphernalia
of scientific study in the field of bac-
teriology a round of these establish-
ments was fruitless none had sold

of the dealers sent boylan to phila-
delphia

  there on the third day of his chase
he found a firm that had sold to de-
tournelles a bill of hospital equipment
-sterilizing engines rubberoid floor-
ing steel chairs et cetera the goods
had been billed direct to an address
on west ninety-third street new
york also the purchaser had taken
away with him a most extraordinary
cinema film showing various animal-
culae microscopically enlarged

  edgerton miles following a tele-
gram received from boylan late that
afternoon was waiting the detectives
arrival at the pennsylvania station at
eight oclock that night with him was
a doctor throop the crump family
physician this provision was also on
boylans orders

  a taxi was boylans command
when they had met outside the train
gate it may be a question of minutes
to save a mans reason no more
could miles draw from the chubby lit-
tle man in the dark beside him during
all the mad ride up to the residence
section off the park when they
alighted before a dark house and en-
countered a locked front door boylan
stood not on the order of his progress
but pried open the door with a short-
handled jimmy

  then the groping through deserted
hallways up a black stairway and in
the direction of a strange moaning
chatter boylans pocket flash showed
the round button of an electric connec-
tion by the side of a door half paneled
in glass he switched the button
lights flashed in the room beyond the
glass

  you go in alone doctor boylan
whispered with a catch in his breath
he had seen the figure stretched on the
cot there its starting eyes well be

in the room below this if you need any
help

  then he led the stupefied miles
downstairs and into a bare room di-
rectly underneath the one from which
smothered animal cries were sounding
the incandescents switched into bril-
liancy revealed the devilish enginery of
the chamber

  in the middle of the room a cinema
projector stood straddling on its tripod
a strip of black film still in place before
the dead lamp and its lens tilted
sharply upward both men followed
with their eyes the direction of the
pointing barrel they saw flush with
the plaster of the ceiling a plate of
glass three feet wide and running half
the full length of the floor above
through its vitreous under surface the
observers could see the dull frosting of
the plate exposed in the room above-
a surface which would catch and hold
as a screen the figures thrown upward
through the lens

  this is a deadly weapon boylan
gritted his round face suddenly flushed
with passion with it our friend the
phantom and his pack of devils at-
tempted murder-the murder of a
mans reason i suppose theyve got
away with his money all weve done
is to save his life-and i hope his
mind

  later when an ambulance came from
st lukes and almost at the same
time mrs crump in her limousine
doctor throop hurried to boylans side
in the hallway below

  take that woman away he com-
manded in a whisper she must not
see

  whatll i tell her boylan urged

  tell her whats true praise god
say hell live and possess his reason
but that the way back will be long-
long

brotherhood

wisdom and wealth ignorance and poverty met at the manger cradle
the first christmas to adore the child whose divine mission was to be
the merging of these opposites into brotherhood it is worthy of note
that the messiah chose ignorance and poverty for his sphere of
spiritual leavening and among lowly laborers toiled at his superhuman task
surely out of labor is born universal brotherhood and the workers of the world
possess that sympathy steadfastness and unity engendered by common experi-
ence and fate which knits the souls of men now also out of labor is prom-
ised a renaissance of simple christianity that shall have nothing to do with creeds
and doctrines and magnificent cathedrals nor with any hierarchy of saints and
prelates but shall follow the humble example of jesus of nazareth who was
content with the wayside the seashore or the house of a neighbor as a place
to preach the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man

    orthodox christianity has become complex and exceeding rich in the past
nineteen hundred christmases and while its influence for good upon humanity
remains peerless yet in this one vital principle has it been discovered wanting
it has failed to make real brothers of men nowhere are the classes of rich and
poor more sharply defined and divided than in the church dedicated to the
worship of the creator and the equality of the human soul wealth sits in its
pew hearkens perfunctorily to holy writ donates generously to church charities
and feels its duty done poverty either does not go to church at all or at best
goes to obtain material help in the spirit of mock humility or secret resentment
labor as represented by the men of factories foundries mines railroads and
kindred industries has practically severed itself from the outward forms of re-
ligion until the complaint of a multitude of preachers echoes with one accord
we have not a single workingman in our congregations and one of the most
apposite-explanations of the situation was in the foolish boast of a congress of
churchmen not many years ago that they had in their respective folds ningty-
five per cent of our richest citizens one would suppose it were ideal that the
church and wealth affiliate but labor regards the combination as one of
mutual benefit rather than one of sacrifice and unselfish devotion

    america is not alone by any means in this marked division of wealth and

labor in the church charles booth in his exhaustive analysis of religious
london came to the discouraging conclusion that the great masses of the people
remain apart from all forms of religious communion france has exhibited the
same phenomenon the workmen in general frankly allied against the clergy and
the established church and the overthrow of clerical power in that country is a
matter of comparatively recent history germany according to authoritative
report is not any better off with less than two per cent of the working classes
attending churches a similar condition is witnessed in other european countries

    with such premises we need not inquire what is wrong it does not call
for a ifeniel to read the handwriting on the wall the laborer and the poor
man object to the rich arid mighty taking possession of the church and controlling
its offices they have found no brotherhood in organized religion in the chris-
tianity whose chief tenet is brotherly love and in their revolt against the church
as an institution of the rich and powerful they have organized bodies of their
own usually of the fraternal class hence the rise of socialism trade unionism
-for individualism in the church bred individualism in economics-the salva-
tion army and hundreds of cooperative and friendly societies some of these
organizations opposed religion and deliberately scorned any recognition of the
spiritual side of humanity for instance socialism was altogether atheistic at
first karl marx its founder declaring the idea of god must be destroyed
but latterly it has been observed that christianity as exemplified by christ and
not by the church has been affecting the ranks of socialism especially in eng-
land and continental leaders of the type of the late jean jaures and emile van-
dervelde went so far as to openly acknowledge the power behind nature and
beyond death

    it is in england however that there has developed what promises to be the
greatest application of christianity in modern days outside the church in the
form of a brotherhood movement which is embracing the laborer and the lowly-
of every condition and kind founded ten years ago by an earnest group of eng-
lishmen headed by the reverend doctor f b meyer and william ward this
brotherhood movement has grown to more than half a million members in
great britain alone while in canada and the united states the number of
adherents increases every year in france and belgium the movement has taken
a strong hold at one meeting in the former country an english apostle being
wildly cheered when he quoted the sermon on the mount australia south
africa new zealand and even germany have been proselytized by the brother-
hood with astonishing success workers everywhere have opened their arms to
the propaganda the principles and aims of the brotherhood movement are con-
tained in this summary

    	to lead men and women into the kingdom of god

    	to win the people for jesus christ

    	to unite men in brotherhoods of mutual help

    	to encourage social study and enforce the duties of christian citizenship

    many philosophers and sociologists have expressed amazement at the rise

and extraordinary impetus of this movement born of labor professor atn-
mundsen of the copenhagen university said socialism has far outrun in its
spirit of enthusiasm the materialism that was once its professed creed here we
have labor leaders mostly socialists preaching christianity another learned
observer exclaimed the labor movement has raised up active forces which
caught in the net



seem destined to save the working classes of europe from materialism and
atheism j keir hardie often called the father of the labor party in
great britain expressed himself in the following words the rich and com-
fortable classes have annexed jesus and perverted his gospel and yet- he
belongs to us in a special degree and the brotherhood movement is tending to
restore jesus to his rightful place as the friend and savior of the poor

    war may have temporarily checked this great surge of religious feeling
among the workers but there is every evidence of its vitality still in the ranks
of citizens and soldiers and those of the brotherhood have been heard to pity
their german confreres and to plan comfort and succor for them when the
present holocaust is over verily a new and glorious chapter of spiritual history
is to be entered and lived after the juggernaut of mars has passed over humanity
this time forever

the governments unused treasures

if the owner of some rare pictures invited us to visit his gallery but offered
us no means of entrance save down the chimney it is not likely we should
risk our necks to see his property we should doubtless find some more
accommodating gallery in which to appease our art hunger and we should
consider it rather silly of him to scold us for not seeing his pictures first

    however this has been our attitude toward our national park picture
galleries travelers who have literally been down the chimney in their efforts
to penetrate the fortresses wherein is hidden americas most splendid scenery
tell us that europe has nothing to surpass our own scenic glories and cannot
equal them in variety this information always raises the cry see america
first we should see america first and without doubt we would see america
first if it were possible for the ordinary tourist-seventy-five per cent of whom
are impeded with petticoats-to journey to it but the alps with a splendidly
built motor road or footpath leading to every gorge and grotto are much more
accessible to americans than our own rocky mountain wonderland undeveloped
as it is by roads and trails

    of all our national parks the yellowstone is most accessible one-fourth
of its area having been developed by wagon roads and trails but according to
enos a mills our greatest authority on mountain parks not over five per cent
of any others can be visited by tourists this is very poor business for uncle
sam considering the fact that before the outbreak of the european war seven
hundred million dollars was being spent annually by american travelers abroad
were our own scenery more get-at-able a round number of these travel millions
would be spent at home

    congress took a step in this direction when during the last session it passed
the national park service bill this bill provides that our sixteen parks and
twenty-two national monuments shall be developed by scenic roads-a scenic
road is not built to cover the least distance but the most scenery between two
points-and hotels these hotels are to be of three classes the high-priced lux-
urious the popular priced and the simple shelter it being uncle sams courageous
hope to suit all the people all the time in order that his visitors may observe
intelligently uncle sam is writing not only guide books but bulletins on the
trees and flowers and rocks of these regions for entertaining qualities the


the popular magazine

information in these pamphlets equal the intrigues of a best seller considering
the fact that the rocky mountain national park established in  and with
its area only one-fifth developed by roads had eighty thousand visitors the
past summer the indications are that when the government gets its picture
gallery opened up america wil rival switzerland in the tourist business

rheims

as you turn the corner and come on it your first feeling is but it is still
standing you say to yourself people have exaggerated the struc-
tural parts are all there the walls are firm the stone roof punctured
but still strong the arches meet the buttresses are stanch to receive
th thrust people can go on worshiping there for six centuries to come the
shrine of france is undefiled

     but when you pass a space of time with it and the eye picks up details you
come away knowing that a quite final indignity has been done to one of the love-
liest buildings in the world for a cathedral is not a barracks which meets every
test if it holds together and keeps out rain water the cathedral was the dwell-
ing place of beauty and that final touch which made rheims has been burned
away the beauty that lay across its west front and glowed in its rose window
is gone the glory of rheims was in the perfection of an infinite number of
details-a perfect portal the untarnished lacework of the stone tracery it is as
if vitriol had been thrown in the face of a beautiful woman she still lives on
her face is still a face able to function but the final grace of expression has
been marred and she no longer answers to something which we went through
the world seeking it is so at rheims the incomparable has been reduced to
the level of a relic half the rose window was shattered and the fragments
fell to the stone floor the other half is punctured hangs loosely and falls each
day in little pieces

     the sacristan picks up the glass from the floor the officer with the writer
stooped and picked up a rectangular fragment and gave it to the sacristan who
later sold it to us he carries a pocket full of bits-blue and red only a few
visitors come through now for the cathedral is only a kilometer from the nearest
trench about one visitor a fortnight from the outside wrorld said the officer
but some day they will come by the thousand then glass from the rose window
of rheims will be sold at a high price the sacristan will do a mayflower busi-
ness and one trusts that his integrity will hold and that no factory will spring
up in a side street to manufacture the peerless red and blue glass of rheims

     you should have seen it at sunset in the old days said the officer as he
pointed to the ragged window

     outside the marred cathedral rides the equestrian statue of joan of arc
fair and free untouched by any of the shells that fell through all that area

santa catalina island clips be-
tween its two horns a little sea-
side town unique of its kind
billy harman had described it to cap-
tain blood as a place where you saw
girls bathing in paris hats however
that may be you see stranger things
than this at avalon

  it is the head center of the big-game
fisheries of the california coast men
come here from all parts of america
and europe to kill tarpon and yellow-
tail and black sea bass to say nothing
of shark which is reckoned now as a
game fish trippers come from los
angeles to go round in glass-bottomed
boats and inspect the sea gardens and
bank presidents steel trust men and
millionaires of every brand come for
their health

  you will see monstrous shark gal-
lowsed on the beach and three-hundred-
pound bass being photographed side by
side with their captors and you will
have the fact borne in on you that the
biggest fish that haunt the sea can be
caught and held and brought to gaff
with a rod weighing only a few ounces
and a twenty-strand line that a child
could snap

  every one talks fish at avalon from
the boatmen who run the gasoline
launches to the latest-arrived man with
a nerve breakdown who has come from
the wheat pit or wall street to rest
himself by killing sharks or fighting

tuna every one here you are esti-
mated not by the size of your bank
balance but by the size of your catch
not by your social position but by
your position in sport and here the
magic blue or red button of the tuna

any foreign order done in diamonds

  colonel culpepper and his daughter
rose were staying at avalon just at
the time the yan shan business oc-
curred on san juan  the colonel
hailed from the middle west and had
a wide reputation on account of his
luck and his millions rose had a
reputation of her own she was reck-
oned the prettiest girl wherever she
went and just now she was the pretti-
est girl in avalon

  this morning just after dawn miss
culpepper was standing in the veranda
of the metropole hotel where the
darkies were dusting mats and putting
the cane chairs in order avalon was
still half in shadow but a gorgeous
morning hinted of itself in the blue sky
overhead and the touch of dusk-blue
sea visible from the veranda the girl
had come down undecided as to
whether she would go on the water or
for a ramble inland but the peep of
blue sea decided her it was irresisti-
ble and leaving the hotel she came
toward the beach

  no one was out yet in half an
hour or less the place would be alive
with boatmen but in this moment of

this series began in the november th popular


the votpuljlv magazine

enchantment not a soul was to be seen
either on the premises of the tuna
club or on the little plage or on the
shingle where the small waves were
breaking crystal clear in the first rays
of the sun

  she came to a balk of timber lying
close to the waters edge stood by it
for a moment and then sat down nurs-
ing her knees and contemplating the
scene before her-the sun-smitten sea
looking fresh as though this were the
first morning that had ever shone on
the world the white gulls flying against
the blue of the sky the gasoline
launches and sailing boats anchored
out from the shore and only waiting
the boatmen the gaffers the men with
rods and the resumption of the eternal
business-fish

  the sight of them raised no desire
in the mind of the gazer she was tired
of fish a lover of the sea a fearless
sailor and able to handle a boat as well
as man she was still weary of the
eternal subject of weights and meas-
ures  she had lived in an atmosphere
of fish for a month and not being
much of a fisherwoman she was be-
ginning to want a change or at all
events some new excitement she was
to get it

  a crunching of the shingle behind her
made her turn it was aransas joe
the first boatman out that morning
moving like a seal to the sea and laden
with a huge can of bait a spare spar
two sculls and a gaff

  anything more unlovely than aran-
sas joe in contrast with the fair morn-
ing and the fresh figure of the girl
it would be hard to imagine wall-
eyed weather-stained fish-scaled and
moving like a plantigrade he was a
living epitome of longshore life and
an object lesson in what it can do for
a man

  joe never went fishing the beach
was his home and sculling fishermen

to their yawls his business the cul-
peppers were well known to him

  joe said the girl youre just the
person i want come and row me out
to our yawl

  wheres your gaffer an your en-
gine man asked joe

  i dont want them i can look after
the engine myself im not going fish-
ing

  not goin fishin said joe putting
down his can of bait and shifting the
spar to his left shoulder not goin
fishin then what dyou want doin
with the yawl 

  i want to go for a sail-i mean a
spin go on hurry up and get the
dinghy down

  joe relieved himself of the spar
dropped the gaff by the bait tin and
scratched his head it was his method
of thinking

  unable to scratch up any formulable
objection to the idea of a person taking
afishing yawl out for pleasure and not
for fish yet realizing the absurdity of
it he was dumb then with the sculls
under his arm he made for a dinghy
beached near the water edge threw the
sculls in and dragged the little boat
down till she was half afloat the girl
got in and he pushed off

  the sun fish vas the name of the
culpeppers yawl a handy little craft
rigged with a buffalo engine so fixed
that one could attend to it and steer
at the same time

  mind you and keep clear of the
kelp said joe as the girl stepped from
the dinghy to the larger craft if you
dont want your propeller tangled up
he helped her to haul the anchor in
got into the dinghy and shoved off

  ill be back about eight or nine she
called after him

  ill be on the lookout for you re-
plied he

  then miss culpepper found herself
in the delightful position of being ab-
solutely alone and her own mistress
sea plunder



captain and crew of a craft that moved
at the turning of a lever and able to
go where she pleased she had often
been out with her father but never
alone like this and the responsible-irre-
sponsible sensation was a new delight
in life which until now she had never
even imagined

  she started the engine and the sun-
fish began tt glide ahead clearing the
fleet of little boats anchored out and
rocking them with her wash then in
a grand curve she came round the
south horn of the bay opening the coast
of the island and the southern sea blue
as lazulite and speckless to the far
horizon

  this is good said miss culpepper
to herself almost as good as being a
sea gull

  sea gulls raced her jeered at her
showed themselves to her now honey
yellow against the sun now snowflake
white with the sun against them and
then left her quarreling away down
the wind in search of something more
profitable

  she passed little bays where the sea
sang on beaches f pebble and deep-
cut canons rose-tinted and showing the
green of fern and the ash green of
snake cactus and prickly pear sea
lions sunning themselves on a rock held
her eye for a moment and then round-
ing the south end of the island a puff
of westerly wind all the way from
china blew in her face and the vision
of the great pacific opened before her
with the peaks of san clemente show-
ing on the horizon twenty-four miles
away to the southwest

  not a ship was to be seen with the
exception of a little schooner to south-
ward she showed bare sticks and
miss culpepper not knowing the depth
of the water just there judged her to
be at anchor

  here clear of the island barrier the
vast and endless swell of the pacific
made itself felt lifting the sunfish with

a buoyant and balloonlike motion
steering the swift-running boat across
these gentle vales and meadows of
ocean was yet another delight and the
flying fish bright like frosted silver
with black sightless eyes chased her
now flittering into the water ahead of
the boat like shaftless arrowheads shot
after her by some invisible marksman

  the great kelp beds oiled the sea to
the northward and remembering joes
advice but not wishing to return yet
a while the girl shifted the helm
slightly heading more for the south-
ward and making a beam sea of the
swell this brought the schooner in
sight

  it was now a little after seven and
the appetite that waits upon good diges-
tion youth and perfect health began to
remind miss culpepper of the break-
fast room at the metropole the snow-
white tables the attentive waiters she
glanced at her gold wrist watch glanced
round at santa catalina that seemed
a tremendous distance away and put
the helm hard astarboard

  she had not noticed during the last
half minute or so that the engine
seemed tired and irritable the sud-
den shift of helm seemed to upset its
temper still more and then all of a
sudden its noise stopped and the pro-
peller ceased to revolve

  miss culpepper perhaps for the first
time in her life knew the meaning of
the word silence the silence that
spreads from the horn to the yukon
from mexico to hongkong held off up
to this by the beat of the propeller and
the pur of the engine closed in on her
broken only by the faint ripple of the
bow wash as the way fell off the boat

  she guessed at once what was the
matter and confirmed her suspicions
by examining the gasoline gauge the
tank was empty aransas joe whose
duty it was had forgotten to fill it up
the night before

  of all breakdowns this was the worst


the popular magazine

but she did not grumble the spirit that
had raised million dollar culpepper
from nothing to affluence was not want-
ing in his daughter

  she said bother glanced at santa
catalina glanced at the schooner and
then stepping the mast of the yawl
shook out her sail to the wind she
was steering for the schooner it was
near the island was far and she reck-
oned on getting something to eat to
stay her on the long sail back also
somehow the sudden longing for the
sight of a human face and the sound
of a human voice in that awful lone-
liness on whose fringe she had intruded
had fallen upon her there were sure
to be sailormen of some sort upon the
schooner and where there were sailor-
men there was sure to be food of some
sort

  but there was no one to be seen upon
the deck and as she drew closer the
atmosphere of forsakenness around the
little craft became ever apparent as
she drew closer still she let go the sheet
and furled the sail so cleverly had
she judgedthe distance that the boat
had just way enough on to bring it
rubbing against the schooners star-
board side she had cast out the port
fenders and standing at the bow with
the boat hook she clutched onto the
after channels tied up and then stand-
ing on the yawls gunwale and with
an agility none the less marked be-
cause nobody was looking scrambled
on board she had not time to more
than glance at the empty and desolate
deck for scarcely had her foot touched
the planking when noises came from
below there were people evidently
in the cabin and they were shouting

  then she saw that the cabin hatch
was closed and not pausing to con-
sider what she might be letting out
the girl mastered the working of the
hatch fastening undid it and stepped
aside

  the fore end of a sailorman emerged

a broad-faced blue-eyed individual
blinking against the sunlight he
scrambled on deck and was followed
by another dark better looking and
younger

  not a word did these people utter
as they stood taking in everything
round them from the horizon to the
girl

  then the first describedbrought his
eyes to rest on the girl

  well im darned said he

ii

  let me interpolate now mr har-
mans part of the story in his own
words

  when cap ginnell bottled me and
blood in the cabin of the heart of
irelandsaid he we did a bit of
shoutin and then fell quiet there
aint no use in shoutin against a two-
inch thick cabin hatch overlaid with
iron platin hed made that hatch on
purpose for the bottling of parties
must have by the way it worked and
by the armamints on it

  you may say we were mugs to let
ourselves be bottled like that we
were y see we hadnt thought it
over we hadnt thought it would pay
ginnell to abandon the heart for a
derelick schooner better found and up
to her hatches with a cargo of cham-
pagne or we wouldnt have let him
fool us down into the cabin like we
did and then clap the hatch on us
leavin alone the better exchange we
hadnt thought it would be nuts to him
to do us in the eye mugs we were
and mugs we found ourselves sittin
on the cabin table and listenin to the
blighter clearin the crew off there
werent no chance of any help from
them chows they were earin for
nothin slong as their chests an opium
pipes was safe

  the skylight overhead was no use
for moren a cat to crawl through if
sej cplundecr	

itd been open which it wasnt moren
an inch and fastened from the deck
side portholes god bless you them
scuttles wasnt big enough for a cats
face to fit in

  i says to blood listen to the
blighters  oh say cant we do nuthin
sittin here on our beam ends aint
you got nuthin in your head  aint
you got a match in your pocket to fire
the tub and be done with it 

   itll be lucky for us says blood
if cap ginnell doesnt fire her before
he leaves her with that i didnt think
anythin more about matches no sir
for haf an hour after the last boat-
load of chows and their dunnage was
off the ship and away i was sniffin like
a dog at the hatch cover for the smell
of smoke and prayin to the amighty
between sniffs

  after that we rousted round to see
how we were fixed up for provisions
and water we found grub enough for
a month and in one of the bunks a
breaker haf filled with water now
that breaker must have been put there
for us by ginnell before we left the
heart to xamine the derelick schooner
he must have fixed in his mind to do
us in and change ship right from the
first i remarks on this to blood and
then we starts a hunt for tools to cut
our way out of there findin nuthin
serviceable but cutlery ware an a cork-
screw two prong forks and knives
wore thin with usin werent what we
were searchin for a burglars jimmy
blastin powder and a drill was more
in our line but there werent any so
we just set to with the knives cuttin
and scrubbin at the tender parts of the
hatch more like tryin to tickle a girl
with iron stays on her than any useful
work for the plates on that hatch
would a given sniff to the plates on
a battleship till i give over and just
sat down on the floor cursin schwab
and the steel trusts and carnegie and
ginnell and the chap that had forged
b p

them plates from the tip of his ham-
mer to the toe of his boots oh why
the blazes says i werent we born
rats  theres some sense in rats rats
would be out and on deck while heres
two chaps with five fingers on each fist
and mens brains in their heads bottled
and done for scratchin like blind kit-
tens shet up in a box and all along
of puttin their trust in a swab they
ought to have scragged when they had
the chanst

   oh shet your head says blood

   shet yours says i im speakin
for both of us its joining in with that
skrimshankers done us bad compny
neither more nor neither less and im
blowed if i dont quit such and their
likes and turn baptis minister if i ever
lay leg ashore again yes thats what
i says to cap blood i was that het up
i laid for everythin in sight then i
goes on at him for the little wed done
forgettin it was the tools were at fault
whats the use says i tinkerin away
at that hatch you might as well be
puttin a blister on a bald head hopin
to raise hair here we are and here
we stick i says till providence lets
us out

  the words were scarce out of my
head when he whips out ginnells gun
which he was carryin in his pocket and
hadnt remembered till then i thought
he was goin to lay for me till he points
the mouth of it at the hatch and lets
blaze there were three catridges in
the thing and he fires the three and
when id got back my hearing and the
smoke had cleared a bit there was the
hatch starin at us unrattled with three
spelters of lead markin it like beauty
spots over the three dimples left by the
bullets

  all the same the firin done us good
-sort of cleared the air like a thunder-
storm-and i began to remember id
got a mouth on me and a pipe in my
pocket we lit up and sat dowm him
on the last step of the companionway


the popular magazine

and me on the table side and then we
began to figure on what hand provi-
dence was like to take in the business

  i says to him theres nothin but
providence left barrin them old knives
and that corkscrew and theyre out of
count were driftin on the kuro
shiwo current aimin right for the
horn you may say but theres the kelp
beds and theyre pretty sure to hold
us a bit theyre south of us and
santa catlinas east of them with lots
of fishin boats sure to be out and its
on the cards that some of them jays
will spot us derelick is writ all over
us-bare sticks and nothin on deck
and sluin about to the current like
a drunk goin home in the mornin

  the cap he cocks his eye up at the
telltale compass fixed on the beam over-
head of him it cheered him up a bit
with its deviations and he allowed
there might be somethin in the provi-
dence business if the kelp beds only
held good

   failin them he says its the
horn and a clear sea all the way to it
with the chance of bein passed be day
or rammed at night by some rotten
freighter i dont know much about
providence he says but if you give
me the choice between the two ill take
the kelp beds

  blood hadnt no more feelins for
religion in him than a turkey he was
a book-read man and ive took notice
that nothin shakes a sailorman in his
foundations s much as messin with
books

  i dont say my own religious feelins
run equal but they gets me by the
scruff after a jag and rubs me nose in
it and they lays for me when im lonely
times with no money or the chanst of
it in sight times theyve near caught
me and made good on the clutch sos
that if im not bangin a drum in the
savation army at this present minit
its only be the mercy of providence

ive had close shaves bein a man of
natural feelins of all the traps laid
for such but blood he held his own
course and not bein able to see that
the kelp beds might have been put there
by providence to hold us a bit-which
they were-and give us a chanst of
bein overhauled before makin a long
board for the horn and sure damna-
tion i didnt set out to lighten him

  well folks that day passed some-
how or nuther us talcin spells at the
hatch to put in the time blood he
found a spare catridge of ginnells and
the thought came to him to scrape a
hole at the foot of the hatch cover and
use the catridge for a blastin charge
the corkscrew came in handy for this
and toward night hed got the thing
fixed now says he youll see some-
thin and he up with the revolver
and hit the catridge a belt with the
butt end and the durned thing back-
fires and near blew his head off

  after that we lit the cabin lamp
and had supper and went asleep and
early next mornin i was woke by the
noise of a boat cornin alongside i sat
up and shook blood and we listened

  then we began to shout and bang
on the hatch and all at once the fasten-
ing went and all at once the sun blazed
on us and next minit i was on deck
with blood after me now what dyou
think had let us out  ill give you
twenty shots and lay you a dollar you
dont hit the bulls-eye a girl thats
what had let us but dressed in white
she wyere with a panama on her head
and a gold  watch on her wrist and
white shoes on her feet and a smile
on her face like the sun dazzle on
water and pretty well i guess im
no beauty-show judge and my eyes
had lit on nothin prettier than ginnell
since leavin frisco so i may have been
out of my reckonin on points of beauty
but she were pretty lord love me
i never want to see nothin prettier
i let out an oath i was that shook
sea plunder



up at the sight of her and blood he
hit me a drive in the back that nigh
sent me into her arms and then we
settled down and explained matters

  she was out from avalon in a mo-
tor boat and shed run short of spirit
and sailed up to us thinkin we were
at anchor providence i should
think so providence and the kelp beds
for only for them wed have been
twenty miles to the suthard driftin
to hades like hutched badgers on a
mill stream we told her how ginnell
had fixed us and she told us how the
gasoline had fixed her  and now
says she will you give me a biskit for
im hungry and i wants to get back
to avalon where my poppa is waitin
for me and hell be gettin narvous
she says

   lord love you says i and how
do you propose to get back

  for the wtind had fallen a dead
cam and right to catalina and ever
to san clemente the sea lay like plate
glass with the kuro shiwo flowin un-
der like a blue satin snake

  she bit on her lip but she was all
sand that girl-culpepper wrere her
name-and not a word did she say for
a minit then she says aimin to be
cheerful well i suppose says she
well just have to stay at anchor here
till they fetch me or the wind comes
 anchor said i why lord bless
you theres a mile-deep water under
us were driftin

   driftin she cries and where
are we driftin to

  that fetched me and i was hangin
in irons when blood chipped in and
cheered her up withlies and told me
to stay with her whiles he went down
below and got some breakfast ready
and then i was left alone with her
trustin in providence she wouldnt ask
no more questions as to where we were
driftin to

she sat on the cargo hatch whiles

i filled a pipe lookin round about her
like a cat in a new house and then
she got mighty chummy i dont know
how she worked it but in ten minits
shed got all about myself out of me
and all about ginnell and blood and
the yan shan and the dollars wed
missed shed learned that i never was
married and who was me father and
why i went to sea at first start right
down to the color of me first pair of
pants she had it all out of me she
was a sure-enough lady but i reckon
she missed her vocation in not bein a
bilge pump then she heaves a sigh
at the sound of ham frying down be-
low and hoped that breakfast was near
ready and right on her words blood
hailed us from below

  hed opened the skylight wide and
knocked the stuffiness out of the cabin
and down we sat at the table with fried
ham and ships bread and coffee before
us

  id never set at table with the likes
of her before but if every real ladys
cut on her bias i wouldnt mind settin
at table with one every day in me life
there was only two knives left whole
after our practice on the hatch with
them blood and she had the whole
ones and i made out with a stump
but she didnt mind nor take notice
she was talkin away all the time she
was stuffin herself pitchin into cap
ginnell just like one of us oh i
guess if shed been a man shed have
swore worth listenin to she had the
turn of the tongue for the work and
what she said about ginnell might have
been said in chapel without makin par-
ties raise a hair but i reckon itd have
raised blisters on the soul of pat gin-
nell if hed been by to hear and if hed
a soul to blister which he hasnt

  mr harman relit his pipe and
seemed for a moment absorbed in con-
templation of miss culpepper and her
possibilities as a plain speaker then
he resumed


the popular magazine

  she made us tell her all over again
about the yan shan business and the
dollars and she allowed we were down
on our luck and she put her finger on
the spot said she you fell through
by not goin on treatin ginnell as you
begun treatin him if he was bad
enough to be used that way he wasnt
even good enough for you to make
friends with them wasnt her words
but it was her meanin

  then we left her to make her tilet
with bloods comb and brush tellin
her she could have the cabin to herself
as long as she was aboard and ten
minutes after she was on deck again
bright as a new pin and scarce had
she stuck her head into the sun than
blood who was aft dealin with some
old truck shouts heres the wind

  it was coming up from suthard
like a field of blue barley and i took
the wheel and blood and her ran to
the halyards she hauled like a good
un and the old heart sniffed and shook
at the breeze and i tell you it livened
me up again to feel the kick of the
wheel wed got the motor boat
streamed astern on a line and then i
gave the old heart the helm and round
she came so that in a minit we were
headin for santa catalina hull down
on the horizon and only her spars
showin so to speak i thought that
girl would a gone mad not at the
chanst of gettin back but just from
the pleasure of feelin herself on a live
ship and helpin to handle her i let
her have the wheel and she steered
good and all the time santa catalina
was liftin and now we could see with
the glass that the water all round the
south end was thick with boats

   theyre huntin for me said she
i guess poppa is in one of them boats
she says and wont he be surprised
when he finds i aint drowned your
fortunes is made says she for pop
owns the haf of minneapolis and i
guess hell give you haf of what he

owns you wait till you hear the yarn
ill sling him- here they come

  they sighted us and haf a hun-
dred gasoline launches were nose end
on for us fanning out like a regatta
and in the leadin launch sat an old
chap with white whiskers and a fifty-
dollar panama on his head

   thats pop she said

  he were and we hove to whiles
he came climbin on board like a turkle
one leg over the bulwarks and one arm
round her neck and then up went a
halalujah chorus from that crowd of
craft round us women wavin handker-
chiefs and blowin their noses and blub-
bing nuff to make a camel sick

  then he and she went down to the
cabin to make explanashions and the
parties in the boats tried to board us
till i threatened them with a boat hook
and made them fend off while we got
way on the heart

  when we were near into avalon
bay the culps came on deck and old
man culpepper took off his hat to me
and blood and made us a speech sayin
wed lifted weights off his heart and
all such

  never mind says blood we
havent done nothin put it all down
to providence says he for if we saved
her she saved us and i aint used to
bein thanked for nothin

  but lord bless you you might as
well have tried to stop the mississippi
in flood as that old party when hed
got his thank gates up he said we
were an honor to merchant seamen
which we werent and the great amer-
ican nation-and blood black irish and
me welsh with an uncle that was a
dutchman-and then im blest if he
didnt burst into potry about the flag
that waves over us all

  it began to look like ten thousand
dollars in gold coin for each of us and
more than like it when wed dropped
anchor in the bay and he told us to
come ashore with him
sb a cplundeh



  now i dont know how longshore
folk have such sharp noses but i do
know them longshore boatmen on ava-
lon beach seemed to know by the cut
of the heart and us we werent no
simple seamen with flags wavin over

instinct or other more special a wall-

synopsis op preceding chapters

    small wonder that rimrock jones was disillusioned with humanity for the very town of gansight
itself owed him its existence yet the element that considered itself exclusive frowned upon him and
his wild ways they did not stop to consider that rimrock put the town on the map and had been
duped and robbed legally by old mcbain and l w lockhart now undismayed at his hard luck
rimrock was again prospecting out in the tecolote hills and felt sure he had struck it rich people
laughed at him and his claims when he tried to borrow money to work his mine he found his friends
scoffing as usual however the little typist for mcbain miss mary fortune a stranger in gunsight
told him she would give him her savings some four hundred dollars provided rimrock would give her
shares in his mine so delighted was he that he swore hed give her half then for a long time
mary heard nothing from him even when he came to town he neglected to look her up she was
nettled but kept her own counsel meanwhile rimrock had done his best with the loaned money but it
was insufficient one day through a trick he manages to get two thousand dollars from the banker
lockhart rimrock thereupon vanishes east he goes to new york and interests capital in his
tecolote property and returns flamboyant and apparently rich gunsight sits up and takes notice
rimrock remembers all his friends generously he visits miss fortune and offers her thousands of
dollars for her share in his tecolote copper but she is firm in her demand to remain a stockholder
and take her regular profits rimrock is annoyed and angry at her stubborn stand though he admires
her spirit at length he agrees to her course and signs an agreement troubles pursue rimrock
he cannot understand mary she is elusive his proposal of marriage she turns down mcbain
tries to jump rimrocks new property after fresh warning from the owner and rimrock kills him
put in jail rimrock refuses to retain a lawyer and is vindicated by the jury on his own showing
mary and other of his friends urge him to relocate the dubious claim to his mine but rimrock
scoffs at their advice though mary wont promise her cooperation in management of the property
against her principles rimrock insists on making her a director in the company whitney stoddard
the new york capitalist behind the tecolote development begins his ciever maneuvering one of his
minions a mrs hardesty comes to gunsight she is beautiful and fascinating and soon has rimrock in
her toils mary disgusted at the affair leaves town without word keeping up her game mrs hardesty

chapter xix

where all men meet

when rimrock had caught the
first train for new york he
had thought it was to seek
out mary fortune-to kneel
at her feet and tell her humbly that
he knew he had done her wrong-
but as the months went by and his de-
tectives reported no progress he forgot
his early resolve the rush and excite-

 ment of that great gambling game that
 goes on in the stock exchange the
 plunges on copper and the rushes for
 cover all the give and take of the great
 chase it picked him up as a great
 flowing stream floats a leaf and hurries
 it along and gunsight and tecolote
 and the girl he had known there seemed
 far away like a dream

  he was learning the game from the
gamblers about him all the ins and
outs of the street the names and

    this story began in the november th popular

methods of all the great leaders and
how they had won their success and
also bold gambler that he was he was
starting on a career of his own in
days gone by at roulette or faro or in
frontier poker games he had learned
to play with big chances against him
and compared to them wall street
was safe the money that he staked
was less than six months earnings of
his share of the tecolote mine and
from the brief notes of l w who was
acting as his agent there was more of
it piling up so he played it care-
lessly like the plunger he was and for-
tune-and mrs hardesty-smiled

  he won on the street and though
the stakes were not specified he seemed
to be winning with her it was a ques-
tion with him whether a woman of her
kind ever thought of such a thing as
marriage she had money of her own
and all that money could buy and her
freedom whatever that was in this
new world about him all the terms of
life seemed changed and transposed
and vague and he never quite knew
what she meant every word that she
said when they discussed life and love
seemed capable of a double intent and
whether by freedom she meant to yield
or to escape was something he had
never made out all he knew was that
at times she seemed to beckon him on
and at others to fend him away she
was fickle as fortune which as he
plunged and covered sometimes smiled
and again wore a frown

  but it was sparkling and stimulating
as the champagne he now drank this
new life with its win and lose and he
played his stakes with the stoical re-
pose of a savage the delighted abandon
of a boy his broker was always buck-
bee that gay laughing beau brummel
who had given him his first start in the
world it was buckbee who had met
him when he first came to the wal-
dorf with his assays and his samples
of ore and after much telephoning and

importuning and haggling had arranged
for his interview with stoddard that
interview had resulted in rimrocks
first clash with stoddard and he had
hated him ever since for a man who
would demand a controlling interest in
a mine for simply lending his name was
certainly one who was fully capable of
grabbing the rest if he could so rim-
rock had fought him but for buck-
bee the broker he had nothing but the
best of good will

  to be sure buckbee worked for
stoddard-that was plainly made evi-
dent at the time they had made the first
deal-but he was open-hearted and
honest and generous with his tips and
rimrock found they were good buck-
bee even went farther he arranged
credit for rimrock at one of the big-
gest banks and when in his plunges he
was caught short of funds the bank
made him loans on his note they took
no chances for he was rated at mil-
lions as half owner of the tecolote
mine but it helped out mightily as he
extended his operations and found his
margins threatened but all this buy-
ing and selling of stocks the establish-
ment of his credit and the trying out
of his strength it was all preliminary to
that great contest to come when he
would come out into the open against
stoddard

  whitney stoddard was a man rated
high up in the millions but he was
fallible like the rest his wealth com-
pared to rimrocks was as a hundred
dollars to one but it was spread out a
hundred times as far and with his
next dividend which was due in de-
cember rimrock would have nearly a
million in cash to stoddard at the
same time there would come nearly
the same amount of money but it
would be gone within a few days
there were obligations to be met as
rimrock well knew that would absorb
his great profits and more the tec-
olote mine before it began to pay had


the popular magazine

cost several million dollars in dead
work that money had been borrowed
and while rimrock took in velvet
stoddard was obligated to pay his
debts

  several months went by and patient
indian that he was rimrock still fol-
lowed on stoddards trail he looked
up his connections with the transcon-
tinental railroad and there he made
his first strike although he molded
the policies of that great corporation
and seemed endowed with unlimited
power his actual holdings in the stock
of the company were almost ridicu-
lously small yet he took advantage of
his dominating position and the influ-
ence it gave him with the directors to
make such coups as he had made with
the tecolote building the branch line
which had given value to his mine as
a business proposition it was a good
investment for the company but who
was it that reaped the big profits by
the investment of less than three mil-
lion dollars-which he had borrowed
as he went along-whitney stoddard
had acquired practically a half interest
in a property which he valued at a
hundred millions and now he was
bucking the hackmeisters

  the thought of this man who had
come up from nothing and was even
yet barely on his feet deliberately at-
tempting to break the great copper
combine was hardly credible to rim-
rock he marveled now at the pre-
sumption of stoddard in offering him
fifty millions for his half and the con-
trol of the mine from what he could
gather stoddard had never possessed
fifty million nor did he possess it then
he was trading on his name and trav-
eling on a shoe string quite the com-
mon thing in new york but rimrock
knew as well as he knew anything that
a man like stoddard was dangerous
as sure as the time came by some hook
or crook he would beat him out of his
mine the thing to do was to beat him

to it-to raid his newly acquired nav-
ajoa stocks and then pinch him until
he let go of tecolote but it must be
done secretly not a word to anybody
not even to buckbee or mrs hardesty
they were friends of stoddards as
well as his-it was safest to work alone

  so while outwardly the same good-
hearted plunger rimrock began his
campaign of revenge it opened with a
series of secret orders to outside
brokers that he knew and soon by
selling navajoa short he had ham-
mered the asking price down then
he bought it in a little at a time until
the market began to rise and then vin-
dictively he slaughtered it again and
gathered in more at the bottom not
for nothing had he listened to mrs
hardesty and buckbee and learned
how the market riggers wrorked but
neither to her nor to buckbee did he
so much as hint of his purpose his
day would come when the tecolote div-
idend was voted when he got his mil-
lion-dollar check and the only thing
that could keep him from a notable re-
venge wras some slip-up in connection
with the dividend

  in the continued absence of mary
fortune with her third and decisive
vote it would be necessary for rim-
rock to agree with stoddard to the ex-
tent of dividing their profits not a
great ways to go even for men who
were sworn enemies and stoddard cer-
tainly needed the money he needed it
badly much worse than rimrock and
would need it from time to time yet
until rimrock actually got his hands on
the money it was essential to conceal
his plans for a shrewd man like stod-
dard if he got an inkling of his pur-
pose was perfectly capable of tying up
their profits and of stopping his credit
at the bank it was dangerous ground
and rimrock trod it warily buying
navajoa in the most roundabout ways
yet month after month increased his
holdings until his credit at the bank
rimrock jones



was stretched if they asked for col-
lateral he could turn over his navajoa
although that would tip off his hand
but his note was still good and he went
in deeper as the date of the annual
meeting drew near

  there came a time when buckbee
asked shrewd questions and mrs
hardesty took him playfully to task
but he carried it off by wise nods and
smiles and the statement that he knew
something good he was learning the
game and to cover up his tracks he
joined the mad whirl of social life in
place of his black sombrero and the
high-heeled boots that had given him
his entree in new york he appeared
one evening in a top hat and dress suit
with diamonds glittering down the
front of his shirt it was a new plunge
for him but buckbee supplied the tailor
and mrs hardesty launched his debut

  she had almost adopted him this
baffling free woman and yet she
still had her reserves she went with
him everywhere but the recherche sup-
pers were almost a thing of the past
it was the opera now and the gayest
restaurants and dinners where they
met distinguished guests but at the en-
trance of the st cyngia when the
graven-faced doorman opened the door
to let her pass she had acquired a way
of giving rimrock her hand without
asking if he wouldnt come in she
played him warily for his nature was
impetuous and might easily lead him
too far but the time came at last when
she found him recalcitrant and in-
surgent against her will

  it was at the opera where amid jew-
eled women and men in immaculate at-
tire they had sat through a long and
rather tedious evening during which
mrs hardesty had swept the boxes
with her lorgnette something that she
saw there had made her nervous and
once in the cloakroom she delayed
rimrock waited impatiently and when
at last she joined him he forced his

way aggressively into the slow-moving
crowd and they were swept  down
the broad marble stairs once a part
of that throng there was no escaping
its surge and yet as they drifted with
the rest two great columns of human--
ity flowing together like twin brooks
that join in a river below she clutched
his arm and started back but the crowd
swept her inexorably on then rim-
rock caught her glance-it was flash-
ing across the foyer to the stream on
the other side he followed it in-
stinctively and there tripping grace-
fully down the stairway as he had seen
her once before at gunsight was mary
fortune his girl

  yes his girl rimrock knew it in-
stantly the girl h had always loved
the one woman he could love forever
if fate would but give him the chance
he started forward but a hand re-
strained him it was mrs hardesty at
his side

  where are you going she asked
and the slim jeweled fingers closed
down on his hand like a vise

  let me go muttered rimrock as
he struggled against her but she jerked
him back to her side

  dont you dare to humiliate me i
she hissed into his ear dont you
dare to leave me-for her

 its mary mumbled rimrock
without taking his eyes from her and
mrs hardesty tightened her grasp

  if you do ill kill you she added
dangerously but rimrock gave no
heed he had forgotten all about her
forgotten she was there the dead
weight that was holding him back all
he saw was mary more radiant than
ever moving toward him down the
stairs she was dressed in soft white
and her glorious brown hair that had
before been brushed down beneath its
clasp was fluffed out now in all its
beauty and she talked and laughed as
she came at her side was an elderly


the vovulfitr magazine

distinguished gentleman who listened
with an indulgent smile-and then they
wrere engulfed in the crowd the mass
of humanity that had swept them down
the stairway closed in and swallowed
them up

  she was gone-but she was there-
right there through the crowd-and
rimrock started toward her mrs
hardesty followed dragged on by main
strength and then resolutely she set
her feet the outraged escorts of
jostled ladies formed a solid phalanx
against him and rimrock wheeled im-
patiently

  let go of my arm he commanded
savagely and then he met her eyes if
he had doubted before the nature of the
tiger woman he could read it now at
a glance she was choking with anger
and her thin even teeth were bared as
she hissed out her breath and then she
spoke very quietly

  if you are a gentleman she said
in his ear you will not fail to escort
me home otherwise-

  she stopped but the roll of her eyes
conveyed a threat that went beyond
words she was a tigress after all a
woman of dark passions and uncon-
trolled anger a woman who beneath
her languid grace had the strength and
the courage to strike and now as she
faced him the mill race of people
surged against them and carried them
on they moved with the crowd there
was no escape and she lashed him with
bitter words he listened unchastened
his head held high his eyes still seeking
for mary and as they plunged into the
opposing currents of the street he met
her face to face

  the distinguished man was talking
now and mary was listening to what
he said yet her eyes that were accus-
tomed to read from the lips were now
free to look about  a swift unbidden
gladness leaped up into them at first
as she recognized rimrock in the

crowd and then quick as lightning she
saw the other woman and the glad look
went out of her eyes they flared up
suddenly with the old anger and re-
sentment and as quickly took on a
distant stare then they turned to her
escort and as rimrock was shoved
past them he heard her answer him
pleasantly it was just a word only
a fraction of a word and then mrs
hardesty broke in what she said fell
again upon unheeding ears but rim-
rock knew it was harsh harsh and
threatening and yet with an undertone
of passion that thrilled him against his
will

  he found himself in a gliding auto
with the street lights twinkling past
and there he came out of his dream

  whats the matter with you he
asked at last as he discovered her still
talking on and she burst into hysterical
tears

  whats the matter she echoed
why cant you see  im in love with
you-thats whats the matter oh i
hate that woman shes a cruel thing
-didnt you see the way she looked at
me but ill pay her back ill get even
with her yet ah how i hate the sight
of her

  she fell to weeping and rimrock
silenced drew away and left her alone
then the automobile stopped and
through the glass they could see the im-
posing entrance of the st cyngia the
chauffeur reached back and threw open
the door and rimrock leaped quickly
out but mrs hardesty did not follow
she sat in the half darkness compos-
ing her hair and working swiftly to
cover the traces of tears and when she
stepped out she was calm

  excuse me she whispered as he
led her toward the door i didnt mean
what i said but i do love you rim-
rock in spite of myself and-wont
you come in for a moment

  they stood by the entrance and the
rimrock jones



sphinxlike doorman opened the door to
let them pass outside it was cold and
from the portals there came forth a
breath of warm air but for the first
time rimrock held back

  no thank you very much he said-
bowing formally and turned quickly
back toward the car she watched him
a moment then drew her cloak about
her and hurried in swiftly through the
door

chapter xx

  a letter from the secretary

  as mrs i-iardesty guessed rimrock
was hurrying away in order to follow
mary fortune and as rimrock
guessed she had invited him in to keep
him from doing just that she failed
for once and it hurt her pride but
rimrock failed as well after a swift
spin through the streets he returned
to his hotel and called up his detective
in a rage

  say what kind of an agency are
you running anyhow  he demanded
when he got his man aint you been
working ten months to find mary for-
tune well i met her to-night on the
street whats that you say theres
three million people well i dont
care if theres six-i want you to find
that girl no stop her nothing you
lay a hand on her and ill come down
to your office and kill you just tell
me where she is and keep an eye 
her and i dont care what you charge
and paste this in your hat-if you
dont find that girl youll have to sue
for your pay

  the agency had to sue-for ten days
later rimrock received a letter from
her hand it was mailed from gun-
sight arizona and was strictly busi-
ness throughout it was in fact the
legal thirty days notice of the annual
meeting of the company

in the town of gunsight county of geroni-
mo territory of arizona on tuesday the

twenty-second day of december to transact
the following business viz

  -to	elect a board of directors

  -to	transact any other business that may
properly come before the meeting

  rimrock read it over and his cour-
age failed him-after all he was afraid
to face her he did not flatter him-
self that she hated him she despised
him and on account of mrs hardesty
how then could he hasten back to
gunsight and beg for a chance to ex-
plain she had fled from his presence
ten months before on the day after
mrs hardesty came and ten months
later when she met him by accident
he was with mrs hardesty again as
far as he knew mrs hardesty was a
perfect lady she went out everywhere
and was received even by millionaires
on terms of perfect equality-and
yet mary fortune scorned her and
would not even argue the matter
rimrock decided to use the inclosed
proxy

 he made it out in the name ol w
lockhart and returned it by the fol-
lowing mail and then he called up the
detective agency and told them to go
ahead and sue he told them further
that he was willing to bet that stod-
dard knew where she was all the time
and if they were still working for him
as he strongly suspected they could tell
him she was back in gunsight rim-
rock hung up there and fell to pacing
the floor and for the first time the busy
city looked gray it looked drab and
dirty and he thought longingly of the
desert with its miles and miles of clean
sand he thought of his mine and how
he had fought for it and of all his
friends in the straggling town of old
juan and l w and hearty old has-
sayamp with his laugh and his texas
yupe and of mary fortune the typ-
ist as he had known her at first-but
now she was sending letters like this

  dear sir  you are hereby notified that
the regular annual meeting of the stock-


the popular magazine

holders of the tecolote mining company
will be held at the offices of the company
in the tecolote hotel et cetera et cetera

  rimrock threw down the letter and
cursed himself heartily for a fool a
chump and a blackguard with a girl
like that and standing all she had from
him to lose her over mrs hardesty
who was mrs hardesty and why
had she gone to gunsight and fetched
him back to new york was it be-
cause he was crazy that he had the
idea that she was an agent somehow
of stoddard that two thousand
shares of tecolote stock that she had
assured him stoddard had sold her
wasnt it part of their scheme to lure
him away and break up his friendship
math mary because if mrs hardesty
had it she had never produced it and
there was no record of the transfer
on the books rimrock brought down
his fist and swore a great oath never
to see the woman again from the
day he met her his troubles had begun
-and now she claimed she loved him

  rimrock curled his lip at the very
thought of any new york woman in
love there was only one woman who
knew what the word meant and she was
in gunsight arizona he picked up
her letter and scanned it again but his
eyes had not learned to look for love
even the dryest formula sent from one
to another may spell out that magic
word may spell it unconsciously and
against the will if the heart but rules
the hand mary fortune had told him
in that briefest of messages that she
was back in gunsight again and fur-
thermore if he wished to see her he
could do so in thirty days it told
him in fact that while their personal
relations had been terminated by his
own unconsidered acts as fellow stock-
holders perhaps even as partners they
might meet and work together again
but rimrock was dense his keen eyes
could not see it nor his torn heart find
the peace that he sought like a

wounded animal he turned on his en-
emy and fought stoddard to keep down
the pain and back at gunsight try-
ing to forget her hate mary fortune
fought her battle alone

 there was great excitement-it
amounted almost to a panic-when
mary fortune stepped in on jepson
during her unexplained absence he had
naturally taken charge of things with
l w of course to advise and to
facilitate business he had moved into
the main oflice wiiere he could work
with the records at hand then as
months went by and neither she nor
rimrock came back to assert their
authority he had rearranged the offices
and moved her records away behind
the main office with its plate-glass
windows and imposing furniture and
front there were two smaller rooms-
the directors meeting place and an-
other now filled with marys records
a clerk who did not even know who
she was sat at his ease behind her fine
desk and back in the directors room
with its convenient table l w and
jepson were in conference she could
see them plainly through the half-
opened door leaning back and smok-
ing their cigars and in that first brief
interval before they caught sight of
her she sensed that something was
wrong

  of course there were apologies and
jepson insisted upon moving out or
giving her any room she chose but
mary assured him she had not come
back permanently and the smaller room
would do just as well then she set
about writing the notices of the annual
meeting which had to be sent out by
her hand and jepson recovered from
his fright perhaps he recovered too
much for mary fortune had intuitions
and she remembered that first glimpse
of l w as the agent of rimrock
and his legal representative it was de-
sirable of course to be friends but
jepson it was well known was the
rimrock jones



agent of stoddard and stoddard was
after their mine therefore it ill be-
came lockhart with one treachery
against him to be found smoking so
comfortably with jepson

  so astonished and stunned had she
been by the changes and the sudden
suspicions that arose that mary at first
had stood startled and silent and jep-
son had raised his voice at this he
remembered that she had gone east
for an operation to help restore her
hearing and seeing her now so unre-
sponsive he immediately assumed the
worst so he shouted his explanations
and mary flushing informed him that
she could hear very well

  oh i beg your pardon he apolo-
gized abjectly but she noticed that he
kept on shouting and then in a flash
of sudden resentment she bit her lips
and let him shout if he still wished
to think that she was deaf as a post
she would not correct him again per-
haps if her suspicions should prove
to be justified it would help her to dis-
cover his plans

  in her room that evening mary
brought from her trunk the ear phone
she had cast aside she had packed it
away with a sigh of relief and yet a
lingering fear for the future and al-
ready she was -putting it on at the
back of the transmitter there was a
mechanical device which regulated the
intensity of the sound when she set-
tled the clasp across her head and hung
the phone over her ear she set it at nor-
mal and then advanced the dial until
she could hear the faintest noise the
roar of the lobby drifting in through
the transom became separated into its
various sounds she could hear men
talking and outbursts of laughter and
the scrape of moving chairs the mur-
mur of conversation in the adjoining
room became a spat between husband
and wife and ashamed of her eaves-
dropping she put down the instrument
and looked about half afraid

  as the doctor through his stetho-
scope can hear the inrush of air as it
is drawn into his patients lungs or
the surge of blood as it is pumped
through the heart- with every telltale
gurgle of the valves so with that pow-
erful instrument she could hear through
walls and know what was being said
it was a wonderful advantage to have
over these men if she discovered that
there was treachery afoot and the fol-
lowing morning to test it out she wore
her phone to the office

  mr jepson she said as he rose
nervously to meet her id like to bring
my books down to date of course it is
mostly a matter of form or i couldnt
have been gone for so long but i want
to look over the records of the office
and make out my annual report

  why certainly responded jepson
still speaking very clearly and assum-
ing his most placating smile id be
glad to have you check up with mr
jones away ive been so pressed by
work i hardly know where we are
just make yourself at home and any-
thing i can do for you please feel free
to let me know

  she thanked him politely and then
as she ran through the files she ab-
sently removed her ear phone

  just hold out that report of the
mining experts she heard jepson re-
mark to his clerk and in an instant her
suspicions were confirmed he had
had experts at work making a report
on their property but he wished to
withhold it from her that report
was doubtless for whitney h stod-
dard the only man that jepson really
served the man who actually controlled
their mine but she worked on un-
heeding and presently from across the
room she heard him speak again his
voice was low but the painful opera-
tions the tedious treatments she had
endured had sharpened her hearing un-
til she caught every word except the
mumbled assent of the clerk


the vopular magazine

  and tell mr lockhart ill arrange
about that rebate the check will go
directly to him

  he went on then with some hurried
directions about the different accounts
to be changed and then without
troubling to shout at her again he
turned and slipped away she had
found him out then the very first day
-mr jepson had an understanding
with l w she retired to her room
to think it over and then went sys-
tematically to work on the books but
these seemed scrupulously correct the
influence of stoddard that apostle of
thoroughness was apparent throughout
the office for jepson well knew that the
day was coming when he must render
an accounting to his master the books
were correct yet she could hardly be-
lieve the marvelous production they re-
corded her share alone-a poor one
per cent of all that enormous profit-
would keep her in comfort for the rest
of her life she need never work again

  but as the days went by and the
yearly profit was reduced to dollars and
cents as she looked over the statement
from l ws bank and saw the mcney
piling up to their credit the first thrill
of joy gave way to fear-of stoddard
and what he might do with interests
so vast lying unprotected what could
restrain his ruthless hand  and yet
there was rimrock wrecking his life
in new york and letting her watch
their mine alone a wave of resent-
ment rose up at the thought-it was
the old hatred that she tried to fight
down-and she clasped her hands and
gazed straight ahead as she beheld in
a vision the woman a lank rag of a
woman a kiplings vampire who lived
by the blood of strong men and to
think that she should have fastened on
rimrock who was once so faithful and
true

  for the thousandth time there rose
up in her mind the old rimrock as she

had seen him first-a lean sunburned
man on a buckskin horse with a pistol
slung at his hip a desert miner clean
laughing eager following on after his
dream of riches but now soft and
fat in top hat and diamonds swagger-
ing past with that woman on his arm
it would be a blessing for them both
if stoddard would jump the mine and
put them back where they were before
-he a hardy prospector and she a poor
typist with a dream but the dream
was gone destroyed forever and all
she could do was to fight on

  as she waited for his letter from
day to day mary fortune thought in-
cessantly of rimrock she went out to
the mine and gazed at the great work-
ings where men appeared no larger than
ants she watched the ore being
scooped up with steam shovels and
dropped load by load into cars she
saw it crushed and pulverized and
washed and the concentrates dumped
into more cars and then the endless
chain of copper going out and the train-
loads of supplies coming in it was
his if he would come to it every man
would obey him his orders could tear
down a mountain and yet he chose to
grow fat and sordid he preferred that
woman to her

  she fought against it but the anger
still raged that had driven her fleeing
from new york how could she en-
dure it to meet him again and yet
she hoped he would come she hated
him but still she waited and at last his
letter came she tore it open and drew
out his proxy and then in the quiet of
her office she sat silent while the let-
ter lay trembling in her hands this
was his answer to her who had en-
dured so much for him his answer to
her invitation to come he inclosed his
proxy for l w

  she began on a letter full of pas-
sionate reproaches and tore it up in a
rage then she wrote another and tore
it up and burst into a storm of tears
rimrock jones



she rose lip at last and dry-eyed and
quiet typed a note and sent it away
it was a formal receipt for his proxy
for lockhart and was signed mary

chapter xxi

the second annual meeting

  the second annual meeting of the
tecolote stockholders found whitney
h stoddard in the chair henry rim-
rock jones was too busy on the stock
market to permit of his getting away
he was perfecting a plan where by
throwing in all his money and all he
could borrow at the bank he hoped to
wrest from stoddard his control of
navajoa besides dealing a blow to his
pride but whitney h stoddard be-
sides running a railroad and a few sub-
sidiary companies as well was not so
busy he had plenty of time to come
to gunsight and to lay out a carefully
planned program as his suppositious
friend the mysterious mrs hardesty
had remarked once upon a time he
was a very thorough man and very suc-
cessful

  he greeted mary warmly and in a
brief personal chat flattered her im-
mensely by forgetting that she was deaf
he also found time to express his grat-
ification that she had approved his idea
of a temperance camp in the election
that followed the inciflmbent directors
were unanimously reelected where-
upon having performed their sole func-
tion as stockholders they adjourned
and immediately reconvened as direc-
tors in marked contrast to the last
this meeting of the directors was char-
acterized by the utmost harmony only
l w seemed ill at ease he had
avoided mary since the day she came
back and even yet seemed to evade
her eye but the reason for that ap-
peared in time

  after the usual reports of the sec-
retary and treasurer showing a con-

dition of prosperity that made even
stoddards eyes gleam mr jepson pre-
sented his report it was a bulky af-
fair full of technical statistics and elab-
orate estimates of cost but there was
a recommendation at the end

  the report of our treasurer said
jepson in closing shows a net profit
of several million dollars but i wish
to point out our losses chief of these
is the enormous wastage which comes
from shipping our concentrates there
is no doubt in my mind that the tec-
olote properties contain an inexhaustible
supply of ore nor that that ore if
economically handled will pay an in-
creasing profit the principal charges
outside the operating expenses have
been freight and the smelting of our
concentrates as you doubtless know
the long haul to el paso and the smel-
ter charges at that end have materially
reduced our net profits the greater
part of this loss is preventable and
i therefore recommend that the com-
pany construct its own smelter

  he went on with estimates of costs
and the estimated saving per ton but
mary allowed her attention to stray
she was thinking of rimrock jones
and she was watching rimrocks proxy
like a criminal on trial l w sat
glowering his dead cigar still in his
teeth and before the end of the report
was reached the sweat was beading his
face

  well i for one began stoddard
diplomatically most heartily approve
of this plan it will necessitate of
course a postponement of profits but
i think we can all stand that i there-
fore suggest that we apply this years
profits to the immediate construction of
a smelter and if i hear a motion we
will consider the question of passing
the annual dividend

  he paused and as mary went on
with her writing a dead silence fell
upon the room l w glanced at jep-


the cpocpular magazine

son and then at stoddard and at last
he cleared his throat

  well mr president he said half-
heartedly this is a new proposition to
me i regret very much that mr jones
isnt here but-well i make a mo-
tion that we build the smelter and pass
the annual dividend

  he spoke with an effort his eyes on
the table and at the end he sank back
in his chair

  did you get that miss fortune
asked stoddard solicitously and mary
nodded her head

  yes i second the motion she an-
swered sweetly and an electric thrill
passed round the room it had not
been expected by the most optimistic
that the vote would be unanimous

  all in favor say aye  spoke up
stoddard sharply but l w had sprung
to his feet

  mr president he began suddenly
panting with excitement and stoddard
fixed him with his steely eyes

  very well mr lockhart he re-
sponded curtly what is it you wish
to say

  why i-i didnt know began l
w haltingly that she was going to
vote-that way

  well you know it now answered
stoddard- freezingly does that con-
clude your remarks 

  oh no burst out l w his drawn
face twitching i-in that case i
change my vote i dont think mr

jones-

  you havent voted yet corrected
stoddard shortly all in favor please
say aye 

  aye  said mary and as stoddard
echoed it he cast a sneering glance at
l w

  do i understand mr lockhart he
inquired pointedly that you wish to go
on record as voting no 

  yes put it down no directed
l w feverishly i dont approve of
this at all rimrock needs the money

he wrote me particularly i wouldnt
put him out for the world he
straightened the stoop from his long
bent back and his eyes opened up ap-
pealingly put me down for a no 
he repeated wildly hell kill me for
this i wouldnt cross that boy for
anything in the world hes the best
friend a man ever had but put me
down no--you will wont you miss

i dont want rimrock to know

  mr lockhart votes no  broke in
stoddard peremptorily the ayes
have it and the motion is carried is
there any other business 

	his cold incisive words seemed al-
most to stab but l w still swayed on
his feet

  id like to explain he went on
brokenly i never go back on a
friend but rimrock hes wasting his
money back there-i thought it would
be a kindness

  yes yes mr lockhart interrupted
stoddard impatiently we all know the
goodness of your heart do i hear a
motion to adjourn

  he shifted his keen commanding
eyes to mary who nodded her head in
return she was watching l w as
he stood there sweating with the an-
guish of that judaslike thought he
had betrayed his friend he had sold
him for gold and already he was sorry

  second the motion said stoddard
all in favor say aye the meeting
stands adjourned

  he rose up quickly and gathering
up his papers abruptly left the room
jepson followed as quickly and l w
still talking found himself alone with
the girl she was gazing at him
strangely and as he paused inquiringly
she went over and held out her hand

  i understand mr lockhart she
said smiling comfortingly i under-
stand just how you feel it was a kind-
ness-i felt so myself-and thats why
i voted as i did
crmrck jones



  the staring eyes of l w suddenly
focused and then he seized her hand

  god bless you he cried crushing
her fingers in his grip youll make
it right on the books god bless you
then i wouldnt sell out that boy for
all the money in the world

  he broke off suddenly and dashed
from the room while mary gazed pen-
sively after him she too in a way
had betrayed her friend but she had
not done it for gold

  as secretary of the company - and
the board of directors it devolved upon
mary fortune to notify rimrock of
the passed dividend she knew as well
as l w knew that it would be a bitter
blow to him but she felt no pity or
regret the money that would other-
wise be wasted in new york would be
diverted to the construction of the
smelter and if he found the loss a hard-
ship he had only himself to thank she
went into her office and shut the door
but simple as the letter seemed she wtas
unable to put it on paper three times
she tried but at each attempt her
pent-up anger burst forth and the cold-
est and most businesslike words she
could summon seemed packed with hate
and resentment she gave up at last
and was sitting listlessly when she
heard voices in the outer room it
was jepson and stoddard and as she
listened closer she could make out what
they said

  ive got a report here said the
voice of jepson that id like to show
you-alone

  there was an impatient slamming of
desk drawers and then the clerk spoke
up-the young man who had taken
marys place

  that report of the experts i put
it in here you remember on account
of miss fortune

  oh yes answered jepson and
by the way where is she

  and then suddenly his voice was
dropped mary reached for her ear
b p 

  phone and slipped it on and listened to
  catch every word if jepson saw fit
  to practice deceit she had no compunc-
  tion in listening in

    well thats all right he was say-
  ing she cant hear what we say
  you go on out for your lunch

    there was a scuffling of feet and
 then still talking jepson led the way
 to the directors room

   yes she reads your lips shes
 really quite clever at it thats her
 running the typewriter now

   he shut the door and for several
 minutes mary played a tattoo on her
 machine then she keyed down
 quietly and setting her transmitter at
 its maxirrium she turned it toward the
 wall

    this is that report the voice of
   jepson was saying that you spoke to
  me about in the spring it gives the
  geology of the whole tecolote proper-
  ties by the very best experts in the
  field-three independent reports made
  in advance of litigation and each comes
  to the same conclusion if we accept
  the ore body as a single low-grade de-
  posit instead of a series of high-grade
  parallel veins-and each of these ex-
  perts does-the crest of that dome the
  old juan claim is the apex of the
  whole in other words according to
  the apex law the possession of the old
  juan claim will give us indisputable
  right to the whole property you can
  look over that yourself

    there was a period of silence broken
  only by the rattling of mary fortunes
  machine and then they began again

   very well said stoddard this
 seems satisfactory now what about
 this l w lockhart in our meeting
 this morning he showed such a con-
 temptible weakness that- now

  jepson that was very careless of you
  why didnt you find out before that
  fiasco how miss fortune intended to
  vote it must have been perfectly evi-
  dent to her from the way mr lock-


the popular magazine

hart talked that he had been-well
overpersuaded to say the least it was
very awkward and if i hadnt rushed
it she might have reconsidered her vote
but never mind that-i suppose you
did your best now who is to relocate
this claim

  well thats the question began
jepson theres a man here named

bray that used to keep a saloon-

  no no broke in stoddard no
disreputable characters now jepson
this is up to you youre the only man

we can trust in an extremity-

  positively-no exclaimed jepson
firmly i absolutely refuse to touch
it ill arrange the preliminaries but
after its started you must look to your
attorneys for the rest

  oh nonsense cried stoddard
isnt it perfectly legal wont the
claim be open to location well then
why this sudden resort to evasion and
hairsplitting and all over a mere de-
tail 

  i have told you before answered
jepson impatiently that its against
the ethics of my profession i am a
mining engineer and if you want this

claim jumped-

  oh yes yes we wont argue the
matter who is this mr bray

  hes a man with nerve-about the
only one in the country that will stand
up to rimrock jones it seems that
jones won his saloon away from him
and gave it to one of his friends some
gambling feud theyve had on for years
but now mr bray is broke i havent
sounded him but for a thousand dol-
lars-

  five hundred

  now mr stoddard burst out jep-
son complainingly you dont under-
stand the gravity of this case do you
realize that already one man has been
killed in trying to jump that claim
and rimrock jones has made the threat
openly that he will kill any man that
does it

  hes a blusterer-a braggart-a
criminal through and through well
make it a thousand dollars now one
thing more-is there any chance that
mr lockhart may still break up all
our plans as i understand it jones
gave him his orders to see that the
assessment work was done there are
still nine days before the first of jan-
uary and it struck me that he was re-
penting of his bargain you must
watch him carefully-he doesnt seem
trustworthy-and positively we must
have no slip-up now does he actually
know that this work has been neglected
--and that if not performed it will in-
validate the claim

  yes he knows it answered jepson
wearily ive been stuffing money into
his bank until he has over a million in
deposits and still the old screw isnt
satisfied hes crazy over money-aiid
yet hes just as crazy over standing
ai with jones you dont realize mr
stoddard what a strain ive been under
in trying to make that man run true
well give him anything we must
win at all hazards before this thing
gets back to jones wre have cut off
his money by the construction of this
smelter but that cant be done again
and once he begins to accumulate his
profits well find him a dangerous man
but we have passed this dividend and
before i get through with him hell be
stripped of every dollar he has won
im going to break that man jepson
if only as an example to these upstarts
who are hounding navajoa ive got
him by the heels and-but never mind
that lets see if our plans are air-
tight now this man lockhart

  hes drunk answered jepson
ill arrange it to keep him soaked
very well now bray 

  hes drinking too ill wait till the
last day and probably send him out
with a guard

  yes make sure of that better send
two guards they can sign their names
rimrock jones



as witnesses in case bray should leave
the territory and now this girl
went on stoddard lowering his voice
instinctively is she really as deaf
as she seems  remember you can
never depend on a woman

  yes shes deaf replied jepson
and you dont need to worry-she
hates rimrock jones like poison did
you notice the way she passed that div-
idend to cut off his supply of slush 
just as sweet and smiling when they
take it like that-well we can forget
about her

  he paused and in the silence a type-
writer began to clack with a fierce stac-
cato note it was mary fortune
writing her letter to rimrock jones

chapter xxii

a fool

 the big day came for which rim-
rock had waited-the day when he
could strike his first blow in his room
at the waldorf he had installed special
telephone connections with a clerk to
answer his calls and close by the table
where he could follow his campaign
a stock ticker stamped away at its tape
it was the morning of the twenty-chird
of december and he had wired l w
for his money all was ready now for
the first raid on navajoa and he went
down to see buckbee the broker

 mr buckbee he said when he
had him by himself i just want to find
where youre at you introduced me
to stoddard and as it turned out we
all of us made on the deal but heres
the question if it came to a show-
down would you be for stoddard or
me 

 why my dear friend rimrock
answered buckbee jovially im afraid
you dont get me right that little deal
with stoddard was strictly on the side 
my business is to buy and sell stock
an order from you will look just as
good to me as one from whitney h

stoddard and it will be executed just
as carefully but if its navajoa you
have on your mind my advice is pos-
itively to lay off ill buy or sell as
much navajoa as you want for the reg-
ular brokerage fee but get this straight
-when you go up against stoddard
you stand to lose your whole roll now
shoot and i give you my word of honor
to execute your-orders to the letter

  all right said rimrock sell ten
thousand shares short dump em over
-i want navajoa to go down

  itll go down answered buckbee
as he scribbled out the order at what
point do you want me to buy 

  dont want to buy replied rim-
rock grimly and buckbee shook his
head

  all right my boy he said debo-
nairly therell be wild doings this
day in navajoa but its people like
you that make the likes of me rich
so divvel another word will i say

  rimrock returned to his roofn and
sat watching the tape as the ticker
champed it out and soon he saw nav-
ajoa it had been quoted at thirty-
two and a half but this sale was made
at thirty he watched it decline to
twenty-eight and twenty-five and soon
it was down to twenty he called up
buckbee

  sell ten thousand more he or-
dered and buckbee went on with the
slaughter

  navajoa went down to eighteen and
sixteen and then it jumped back to
twenty big buying developed but still
rimrock sold short and again navajoa
slumped at the end of the day it stood
at twenty and he prepared for the next
step in his campaign he had beaten
navajoa down to nearly half its former
price and without parting with a single
share he had at that moment in stock
bought and paid for enough to cover
all his short selling-this raid was to
call out more when stock is going
up the people cling to it but when it


the popular magazine

drops they rush to sell already he
could see the small sales of the pikers
as they were shaken down for their
shares the next thing to do as he
had learned the game was to buy in
and then hammer it again

  on the twenty-fourth the day before
christmas he bought till he could buy
no more and still the price stayed down
it was the holidays slump so the
brokers said but it suited him to a
nicety the next day was christmas
and he wired once more for his money
for l w had not answered his first
telegram and then he went out with
the boys since his break with mrs
hardesty he had taken to dodging into
the bar where he would be safe from
her subtle advances but on christmas
eve he went too far they all went
too far in the matter of drinking but
rimrock went too far with buckbee
he told him just exactly what he in-
tended to do to stoddard which was
indiscreet to say the least but buck-
bee who was likewise in an expansive
mood told in turn everything he knew
and the following day as rimrock
thought it over he wondered if he had
not been wrong

  buckbee had assured him that the
stock on the market represented less
than half of the navajoa capitalization
and if that was the case it wras hope-
less of course to try to break stod-
dards control but strictly as a friend
and for old times sake buckbee had
offered to sell rimrocks stock at a
profit he had even gone further and
promised to pass it on to stoddard who
was in the market to protect his hold-
ings at twenty-four which was where
it was selling rimrock would clean up
a tidy sum and every cent of that ab-
solute velvet would come out of stod-
dards pocket it was a great tempta-
tion but as rimrock sobered he remem-
bered that it was a fight to a finish
he had set out to break whitney stod-
dard

  the next morning at ten he sat at
his desk waiting expectantly for the
stock exchange to open it was to
have been his big day when with over
a million dollars from his dividends
he had intended to buy in navajoa but
there was one thing that left him un-
easy his money had not come if it
had been sent by registered mail the
christmas glut would easily account for
the delay but three telegrams had re-
mained also unanswered he pondered
for a minute whether to wire to mary
or not and then the telephone rang

  hello said a voice this is buck-
bee speaking what do you think about
the proposition i made

  wtiat proposition demanded rim-
rock and then he grunted intolerantly
as buckbee renewed his offer for the
stocks you must be drunk he said
at the end and a merry laugh came
back over the phone

  no all joking aside-im sober now
what do you say to twenty-four
too little bluffed rimrock i
want at least thirty

  will you take that 

  no replied rimrock nor thirty-
five im in the market to buy

  well how much do you want
then began buckbee eagerly its all
the same to me as long as it moves
and i get my commission i dont care
who buys the stock but ill tell you
one thing-youll have to put up more
margin if you start to bidding it up
twenty per cent at the least and if
it goes above thirty ill demand a full
fifty per cent you want to remember
old scout that every time you buy on
a margin the bank puts up the rest
and if that stock goes down theyll
call your loan and youre legally liable
for the loss youll have to step lively
if you buck whitney h stoddard hes
liable to smash the price down to noth-
ing

  ill show him gritted rimrock
but ill call up that bank first and
rimroci jones



find out just how far i can go a man
like me worth fifty millions at least

        j

  ye-es jeered buckbee and as the
broker hung up rimrock called the
president of the bank it took time to
get him but when rimrock stated his
case he promised an immediate report
the answer came within half an hour
-he could borrow up to five hundred
thousand

  all right said rimrock and call-
ing up buckbee he told him to go ahead
and buy

  how much inquired buckbee

buy all you can get answered rim-
rock briefly and hurried off to the bank

  now about this loan said the pres-
ident pleasantly i find wre have al-
ready given you money on your note
up to nearly the entire five hundred
thousand of course theres no ques-
tion of your ability to pay but wouldnt
it be more businesslike if you could put
up a little collateral 

  for instance said rimrock and
at the note of antagonism the president
was quick to explain

  of course you understand he went
on cordially you are good as far as
im concerned but wre have such
troublesome things as bank examiners
and the lawr is very strict in fact a
loan of half a million dollars on the
unindorsed note of one man--

 how much do you want asked
rimrock and fetched out a great sheaf
of navajoa

 well-not navajoa said the
banker uneasily we have quite a lot
of that already on brokers loans mr
buckbee you know but if you would
just put up say two thousand shares
of tecolote-

  no

  we could loan you up to two mil-
lion

  the president paused and glanced at
him mildly but rimrock had thrown
down his stock

  no he said you can take this
navajoa or ill quit and go somewhere
else i wouldnt put up a single share
of tecolote if youd give me your whole
danged bank

  very well said the president with
a fleeting smile well accept your nav-
ajoa my secretary will arrange it-
but mind this is on a call loan give
him credit for five hundred more he
added and the clerk showed rimrock
out

  there are certain formalities that the
richest must observe before they can
borrow half a million and it was nearly
noon before rimrock was free and on
his way to the hotel he was just leap-
ing out of his taxicab when he saw mrs
hardesty reeling toward him

  oh rimrock she gasped ive
had such a blow wont you take me
back to my rooms  oh i cant explain
it but whitney h stoddard is trying
to force me to give up my stock that

tecolote stock-

  here get into this taxi said rim-
rock on the instant now where do
you want to go

  to the st cyngia on ninety-fifth
street-and hurry  she -commanded
and the chauffeur slammed the door

  now whats the matter demanded
rimrock hurriedly i havent got a
minute to spare did you notice nav-
ajoa  well ive got a buy order in

  oh no ive seen nothing-not
since he sent me that message it
seems hes back in town

 who whitney stoddard well
let me get out then ive got to get
back to that tape

  oh no she murmured sinking
against him with a shudder dont
go and leave me alone i need your
help rimrock my whole fortune is
involved its either that or give back
the stock

 what stock asked rimrock
that twto thousand tecolote well


the ppuljr magazine

you just give that to me have you
really got it or are you just stalling
let me look at it and ill see you
through hell

  its in my apartment she answered
weakly ill show it to you when we
are there ah rimrock something
told me you would come to save me
but-oh im ready to fall

  she dropped against him and the
startled rimrock took her quickly
within his arm they rode on swiftly
and as she lay panting on his breast she
told him the story of her misfortune

  i dont deserve it she said to
have you help me because i started to
do you a wrong i didnt know you
then nor your generous heart-and so
i made the agreement with stoddard
i was to go to gunsight and get ac-
quainted with you and get you to come
back to new york-and for that i was
to receive two thousand shares of tec-
olote stock oh not as a present-id
never think of that-but far below what
they are worth it would take all the
money i had in the world just to make
a part payment on the stock but i
knew how wonderfully valuable they
were and so i took the chance

  she sighed and leaned against him
closer while rimrock listened eagerly
for the rest

  can you understand now why ive
seemed worried and anxious and why
ive concealed my affairs i went there
and met you but when i refused to
betray you i found i was caught in a
trap whitney stoddard is hounding
you in every possible way to make you
give up your mine and after i refused
to give back my stock he set out de-
liberately to ruin me

  she shuddered and lay silent and
rimrock moved uneasily

  what was it he wanted you to do
he asked at last and she tore herself
swiftly away

  i cant tell you-here but come up

to my rooms i defied him but i did
it for you

  she fell quickly to rearranging her
hair and hat in preparation for the
short dash past the doorman and at the
end she looked at him and smiled

  i knew you would come she said
and as he helped her out he thrilled
to the touch of her hand at odd times
before she had seemed old and blase
but now she was young and all alive
he dismissed the taxi without a thought
of his business and they hurried up
to her apartments she let herself in
and as she locked the door behind them
she reached up and took his big hat

  you must stay a while she said
the servants are gone and i have no
one to protect me if they come to serve
the papers just start the fire-and if
any one knocks dont let them break
down the door

  she smiled again and a sudden gid-
diness seemed to blind rimrock and
make him doubt where he was he
looked about at the silken rugs and the
luxurious hangings on the walls and
wondered if it was the same place as
before even when he lit the laid fire
and sank down on a divan he still felt
the sweet confusion of a dream and
then she came back suddenly trans-
formed by a soft house gown and
looked him questioningly in the face

  can you guess she asked as she
sat down beside him what it was that
he wanted me to do no not to be-
tray you or get possession of your
stock all he asked was that i should
marry you

  marry me exclaimed rimrock
and his keen staring eyes suddenly nar-
rowed as she bowed her head

  yes marry you she said that
was what made it so hard did you
notice when i stopped inviting you
here i was afraid my rimrock i
was afraid i might forget and-marry
you that was the one spot where
stoddards plan failed he forgot that
rimcrock jones



i might fall in love i loved you rim-
rock loved you too much to marry you
and so i broke up all his plans if
i had married you dont you see how
easy it would have been fdr me to get
hold of your stock and that girl tut
there-the one i dont like-she would
have thrown her vote to stoddard
that alone would give him control
they would have fifty per cent of the
stock

  no they wouldnt corrected rim-
rock not if youve got that two thou-
sand that would give us fifty-one
per cent

  a shadow of annoyance passed over
her face as if some part of her plan
had gone wrong and then her eyes took
on a fire

   us  she said would you have
married me rimrock  but surely not
for the stock oh i wish sometimes

- she stopped abruptly and

looked at him strangely and then she
hurried on ah no she sighed that
can never be-you are in love with that
other woman-out there when you
met her at the opera you forgot all
about me you went off and left me
alone if whitney h stoddard had
called me up then her eyes flashed
dangerously and she looked away at
which rimrock glanced quickly at his
watch

  by-grab he exclaimed half ris-
ing to his feet do you know its half
past twelve say wheres your tele-
phone ive got a deal on in navajoa
and ive just got to find out where i
am

  she rose up suddenly and turned to
face him with a look of queenly scorn

  i have no telephone she answered
evenly and if i did have i would
not lend it to you youre just like
the rest of these men i see you think
in terms of stocks i should have done
as stoddard said and paid you back
for your rudeness do you know mr
jones that you think more of money

than of anything else in the world are
you aware of the fact that all the love
and devotion that any poor woman
might bestow would be wholly wasted
and worse than wasted on a miserable
stock gambler like you ah i was a
fool she burst out stamping her foot
in a passion and then she sank back
on the divan and wept

  rimrock stood and gazed at her then
glanced absently at his watch and
looked about shamefaced for a phone
but in that elegant apartment with its
rich furnishings and tapestries there
wras no place for a crude commercial
telephone and the door to the inner
room was closed he turned toward
the outer door for his business was
urgent but she had carried off the key
he stirred uneasily and a shrewd doubt
assailed him for her weeping seemed
all at once sophisticated and forced and
at the movement she raised her head
one look and she had cast herself upon
him and twined her arms about his neck

  i cant help it i cant help it she
sobbed convulsively and drew down his
head and kissed him i cant help it
she whispered i love you rimrock
i cant bear to let you go

  she clung to him passionately and
with tremulous laughter tugged to draw
him back to the divan but rimrock
stood upright and stubborn he put
away the hands that still clung and
petted and gazed fiercely into her eyes
and the woman faced him-without a
tear on her cheek for all the false weep-
ing she had done

  hows this he said and as she
sensed his suspicion she jerked back in
sudden defiance

  a stock jobber she mocked all
you think of is money the love of
a woman is nothing to you

  aw cut out that talk commanded
rimrock brutally some women are
stock jobbers too and speaking of
stock just give me a look at those two
thousand shares of tecolote


the popular magazine

  a sullen sulky pout distorted her
mouth and she made a face like a will-
ful girl

  youd snatch them she said and
run away and leave me and then what
would i say to stoddard

  are you working for him he asked
directly and she threw out her arms
in a pet

  no i wish i were but its too late
now i might have made money but
as it is i stand to lose everything
oh you stand to lose everything
do you well say that reminds me
i guess i stand about the same

  he picked up his hat and started for
the door but she caught him by the
arm

  youre going to that woman she
said vindictively perhaps i can tell
you something about her well i can
she declared and i can prove it too
i can prove it by my tecolote stock
you havent got any stock an-
swered rimrock roughly but he
stopped and she drew back and smiled

  oh she said as she noted his in-
terest youre beginning to believe
me now well i can show you by the
indorsement where she sold out to stod-
dard over a month before i came she
sold him two thousand shares of tec-
olote for exactly two million dollars-
and thats why she left when i came
she was afraid you would find her out
but you you poor fool you thought
she was perfect and had left because
her feelings were hurt but she
couldnt fool me i could read her like
a book and ill tell you what she had
done

  youll do nothing of the kind
broke in rimrock savagely youll go
and get me that stock i wont believe

a word you say-

  what will you give me if i do
she demanded coquettishly at the same
time backing away

  ill give you a nice sweet kiss an-
swered rimrock twisting his mouth to
a sinister smile and if you dont

  ah will you she cried as she
started toward him and then she
danced mockingly away

  you can keep it for her she flung
back bitterly and passed out through
the inner door

  like a lion held in leash rimrock
paced up and down and then he lis-
tened through the door all was silent
and with a sudden premonition he laid
a quick- hand on the knob the door
was locked against him he listened
again then spoke through the keyhole
then raised his voice to a roar the
next moment he set his great shoulder
to the panel then drew back and lis-
tened again a distant sound like a
door softly closing caught his ear and
all was still he hurled himself with
desperate vehemence against the door
so treacherously locked and with a
crash it leaped from its hinges and he
stumbled into the room from where
he stood rimrock looked about in a
daze for the room was stripped and
bare the table the furnishings all
that had made it so intimate when he
had dined with the tiger lady before
all were gone and with the bareness
there came a chill and the certainty that
he had been betrayed he turned and
rushed to the outer entrance but as
he laid violent hands on that door it
opened of itself and with such unex-
pected suddenness that he fell backward
on the floor he rose up cursing for
something told him whose hand had un-
locked that door but she was gone and
all that remained was a scribbled card
in the hall

  kiss your money good-by was
written on its face and on the back

   one man brings another four hundred miles to answer the question
thomas bailey aldrich once asked about a certain situation for a story
what would happen if you knew you were the last human being alive in
the world and you were sitting alone in your study and suddenly your
doorbell rang

do you happen to know just why
youre here  asked ryckman
as i stepped into the waiting
motor car

  because you sent for me was my
deliberate retort i stared about the
lonely little station half buried in snow

  ryckman cranked the car shook the
snow from the lap robe that had been
covering his radiator and crowded in
beside me we backed about swung
into the frozen road and crawled south-
ward across a country blue gray with
wintry twilight

  youve been wondering why i did
send for you of course said ryckman
as he pushed the lap robe over across
my knees and now youre here ill
explain it you see you could never
make it clear in a telegram

  why not i asked

  buchner ryckman said after a
silence do you remember what
thomas bailey aldrich once asked
about a certain situation for a story 
what would happen if you knew you
were the last human being alive in the
world and you were sitting alone in
your study and suddenly your doorbell
rang

  i turned and stared at ryckman as
he bent over his wheel

  did you bring me all the way up
here to answer that question i de-
manded

  yes was his answer

  ryckman had always been odd but
i had never thought of him as insane
that he was not without temperament
had been made plain to me seven long
years before when i first became his
attorney we had then stopped by in-
junction one of his own plays because
a broadway manager had grabbed a
third-act ending and since then we
had been through most of the small
legal skirmishes which every successful
author i suppose has to face

  yet success had not greatly added
to ryckmans eccentricities he had al-
ways loved solitude i knew when
struggling with a new drama and this
was largely based on the fact that he
composed viva voce striding up and
down his study and shouting his big-
scene speeches to a waiting stenogra-
pher so i had not been surprised when
he wrote me that winter saying he had
snatched up a huge old country house
on lake erie and was leaving the city
to give three months of hard work to
the new frohman comedy

  but i was not willing to swallow four
hundred miles in an overheated sleeper


the cpocpulflcr magazine

 and accept a spoiled christmas holiday
 as the negligible whim of a tempera-
 mental playmonger

  so i looked at the capped and muf-
flered ryckman for some time trying
to sweep back the wave of anger which
was inundating my weary body

  so ive been brought here on the
matter of a doorbell i inquired with
ironic placidity

  precisely said ryckman

  on the matter of your doorbell
which somebody has been making so
bold as to ring i went on

  exactly said the man at my side

  but my dear ryckman i retorted
 exasperated by the theatricality of his
 attitude the situation seems rather
 without point in this case because you
 do not happen to be the last human be-
 ing alive in the world

  thats where youre wrong he
quickly amended  i am the only hu-
man being alive in the world

  oh are you  i echoed steeling my-
 self for some confession of incipient
 paranoia it was clear i told myself
 that the man had been overworking

  i mean im the only human being
left in this world of mine up here
explained ryckman

  how about burke i asked

  burke was ryckmans stenographer
who had been with the playwright i
knew for the last three years at least

  burke left three days after my
housekeeper went he couldnt stand
it any more than the others could

  stand what i demanded

  the bell was ryckmans answer

  i tried to be as calm as possible

  what did the bell do i finally in-
 quired

  it rang

  ryckman had uttered this foolish an-
 swer in a quite matter-of-fact tone but
 for some absurd reason i experienced
 a faint horripilation of the nerves

  bells have a habit of doing that

  no they havent solemnly and de-

 cisively declared ryckman not with-
 out some human being first making
 them ring not without some earthly
 reason or cause

  i could afford to laugh at his solem-
nity

  and this is some super-rational bell
that rings of its own sweet will and
givs you goose flesh along your idiotic
young legs just because a couple of
wires have got crossed

  he turned to me with a quick and
reproving side glance i could see his
face thin and blue with tfoe cold in
the shadowy half light of the snow-
muffled dusk

  there are no wires to get crossed
he declared it is just a plain bell that
has to be pulled pulled by some ones
hand the only wires that are getting
crossed are the wires in my brain i
tell you i cant stand this thing much
longer ive got to straighten it out
in some way

  i sat silent momentarily disturbed
by the rising note of protest in his voice
it was clear that the man was not him-
self

  been working hard i finally in-
quired

  i cant work he cried this thing
has got on my nerves and knocked
everything out of my head

  then why are you staying here

  i want to get to the bottom of it
was his answer ive got to under-
stand it

  i thought things over then i went
back to the question of the bell

  youre sure it actually rings i
asked

  as sure of it as i know were sitting
in this car

  and without reason

  he nodded an affirmative

i even lampblacked the pull knob
hoping to get finger prints something
to work on but there was no sign
that a human hand had touched it
again i felt that small chill along
the bell



the nerve ends but i forced a laugh
at the solemnity of his face

  and the servants-burke and others
-what stampeded them

  they knew the bell- rang

  when would it ring

  at night

  and how did they explain it 
they couldnt explain it thats
what stampeded them

  but they must have talked about it
burke told me they had passed a
story on from one to the other about
a woman being killed in the place and
buried under the bricks in the cellar
being lowbrows they accepted the
story-even burke did at last and with
the usual results

  and you yourself  i inquired
ryckman threw me another quick
side glance

  im not altogether foolish he re-
plied then he added without looking
at me and the cellar floor isnt of
bricks its solid cement

  any details about that woman  i
asked feeling that the more ryckman
could externalize the thing as the
psychopathologists phrase it the better
it would be for him

	nothing authentic naturally those
yarns never are authentic but as far
as i can gather the house was built
about thirty years ago by a retired lake
captain he was in middle life then
and married a young wife they had
two children the first a boy was del-
icate and afraid of the water this
used to anger the old captain who took
the boy out in a boat and threw him
overboard to make him a swimmer
the shock or the strain on the boys
throat when he screamed ruptured the
vocal chords at any rate according
to the story it left him a mute and
the boys mother never forgave his
father they lived under the same
roof side by side for two years with-
out speaking then the captain disap-

peared they said he went back to
the lakes took up sailing again then
he came back one winter and tried to
make up with his wife she still re-
fused to speak to him he was drunk
and turned her out in zero weather
three times she came back and rang
the bell the third time they say he
dragged her in and killed her as a
matter of fact i suppose she died of
exposure or probably was never even
turned out of the house

  and the boy with the ruptured vocal
chords

  he went to baltimore and had an
operation on his throat and got his
voice back he and his younger sister
turned the place-they called it pine
brae-into a fruit farm butold cap-
tain hudsons family disputed the title
and threw it on the market thats
how it came into my hands

  we had turned off the main road
and were winding down through a
stretch of heavily wooded hills we
chugged and stuttered in past two huge
stone gateposts crawling on second
speed through a spectral-looking or-
chard then we took a turn to the left
and skirted a thick tangle of pine trees
half hidden in the gloom of these pines
i could make out the still gloomier pile
of the house without a light or a sign
of life showing from any of its win-
dows as i sat in the car while ryck-
man got out to unlock his garage door
i could hear the sound of the lake
booming desolately on the ice ridge
along the shore

  this is surely a sweet and home-
like corner of the world youve bought
yourself i told him with a candor
bom of much weariness of body and
depression of mind

  i dont believe ill buy the place
he said as he stood staring into the
gloom of the pines

  but you have bought it

  not altogether he afnended


the popullr magazine

theres a disputed title somewhere or
other that is one of the things youve
got to look into for me at the county
seat ive been too busy and im not
much good at that work

  again i detected a flaw in my young
clients line of talk but i did not draw
his attention to it

  well thats saner work than wait-
ing for bells to ring i told him as i
followed in his steps and circled the
gloomy pile that huddled back among
its gloomy pines i stood beside him
as he took out a key to unlock the for-
bidding oak door i could see the faint
glimmer of a polished brass knob i
reached out and touched it feeling sure
it was the hand knob of a pull bell
then i let my gloved fingers close about
it the next moment i pulled promptly
and deliberately on the knob

  from beyond that still unlocked door
from somewhere deep within the silent
and tomblike house i could hear the
sudden brazen clamor of the bell i
dont know whether it was the uttter
desolation of the place or my own de-
pressed spjrits or the ghostly nonsense
which ryckman had been dishing up
to me but as i heard those muffled
sounds reverberating through the gloom
which i could not decipher i felt a
shiver speed up and down my backbone

  ryckman swung about as though he
had been shot

  was that you  he gasped catching
at my arm

  of course it was me i retorted
but i could see that it had given him
a bad turn

  again i forced a laugh as i struck
a match for him he stood there until
it burned out before he turned again
to unlock the door then i struck a
second match this time i held it close
to the bell knob and looked it over
then i stepped in through the opened
door at ryckmans heels following him
into the silence of the unlighted house

ii

  i found the interior of ryckmans
house much more comfortable than i
had anticipated and i made the fur-
ther discovery that ryckman himself
was a much more practical-minded man
than i had thought him he soon had
a wood fire roaring in the huge fire-
place of the great high-ceilinged hall
which ran the full length of the house
then came a hot supper of his own
cooking and coffee and cigars and
although the wind increased as the night
advanced and the sound of it in the
pine tops was no blither than the boom-
ing of the surf on the ice ridge below
the lake cliffs i found myself what
with the hot meal and the lighted lamps
and the open fire and the easy-chairs
in a much more comfortable frame of
mind

  the situation as we smoked and
talked became a more matter-of-fact
one and when ryckman carried a lamp
to the rear end of the wide reception
hall and pointed out the bell which was
given to ringing without earthly reason
or cause i could even view that bell
with half-amused disdain

  it was an old-fashioned and very or-
dinary-looking bell swinging on the end
of a curling steel band wire when
once set in motion because of this wire
it would naturally oscillate for some
length of time i noticed that it stood
high above the door tops and could
not be easily interfered with by any
one crossing the back of the hall which
heaven knows had doors enough stand-
ing on either ide of it i made par-
ticular note of this for the back end
of the hall was in shadow far beyond
the radiance of our open fire and the
large reading lamp which stood behind
us and the deeper the shadows i knew
the better the chances for that trickery
of the senses which is all too readily
accepted as the supernatural

  so fortified in fact did i become
the bell



in my skepticism that i determined to
cut off all other chances of trickery i
first insisted on making sure we were
alone in the house and this we did
by a most thorough and painstaking
search of the place from attic to cellar
during that search which was a dismal
and bone-chilling experience i stitm-
bled on nothing that could be made to
serve as an elucidation of ryckmans
tuppeny little mystery i discovered
though that the house was even larger
and drearier than i had first thought it
i also discovered that the cellar in
which ryckman had made preparations
for installing a hot-water furnace was
a solid-walled well-floored place in no
way suggestive of the abnormal the
only feature of that cellar which could
be called in any way irregular was a
door which opened into a passageway
running under the terrace to the east
of the house but this passage ryck-
man explained had originally connected
with a frame building holding two huge
cider presses for when the orchards of
pine brae were in their prime the
earlier owner had thought to make a
business of champagnizing and aging
native cider for the city market

  i made it a point to see however that
the door of this passage was securely
locked just as i made it a point to see
that every door and window on the
ground floor could not be tampered with
by a possible intruder and as for in-
truders i knew that no one could ap-
proach the house without leaving in the
freshly fallen snow unmistakable marks
of that approach yet before we set-
tled ourselves before the open fire again
i obtained a hammer and wood chisel
from the quietly condoning ryckman
with these after some difficulty i re-
moved an inner board from his front-
door casement and then a couple of
the floor boards to make sure as i had
expected that the bell wire ran along
to the back of the house under our feet
and not overhead mv first impulse was

quietly to cut this wire but on second
thoughts i surreptitiously loosened the
set screw which held the brass bell pull
in place then stepping outside for a
moment on the pretext of making sure
there were no footprints in the freshly
driven snow i drew the brass knob
from its socket and slipped it into my
pocket

  when i lighted a fresh cigar in front
of ryckmans open fire i was fortified
with the knowledge that no one outside
the house could ever interfere with my
neurasthenic friends bell i nursed the
even more comforting conviction that
for one night at least this sleep-disturb-
ing bell would remain quite normal
i had to struggle against a tendency
in fact to doze off in the very face of
ryckmans spasmodic and thin-voiced
talk i even laughed a little from the
depths of my chair when he showed
me the ross rifle he had brought into
the hall and left leaning there in its
corner protesting that he always felt
safer with the firearm at his elbow
then i stretched myself and told him
that i was tired and thought id turn
in

  he stopped short at these words from
me and a look of trouble deepened on
his thin and none-too-happy face

  id rather youd wait he said

  wait for what i demanded

  he moved his head toward the hall
end where i knew the bell swung on
its spring

  but nothings going to happen i
protested as i sat watching him stare
into the shadows at the back of the
house nothing can happen 

  i want you to wait he said with
a new and more wistful note in his
voice he was still watching the shad-
owy hall end but i could see that his
stare was not directed toward the bell
itself

  ryckman i suddenly asked him
is there anything in this besides the
mere ringing of that bell up there


the popular magazine

  yes he replied after a pause but
still he did not look at me i became
more conscious of a sense of reserva-
tion about the man and everything he
had said to me

  whats the other thing i inquired

  his right hand groped behind him
feeling for the chair arm having found
it he sank slowly down into its depths

  its a woman he said and i
caught his vague look of abashment
his eye flash of mute protest against
possible ridicule as the strong side light
picked out the shadows on his lean and
tragic face

 you mean you see a woman i
asked struggling to make my tone a
casual one

  i tell you buchner ive seen her
as plain as i see that reading lamp god
only knows where she comes from or
where she goes but every line of her
face stands out as distinctly as though
it had a stage spotlight on it

  and you want me to sit up for a
thing like that i demanded with a
pretense at disgust

  yes he replied quite simply

iii

  i had been reading on and off for
about an hour when ryckman got up
from his chair and crossed to the fire-
place he put on a fresh log lighted
a cigarette and stood looking down at
me

  i guess its no use he said with
a sigh of weariness

  of course its no use i told him
the combination you see is broken
according to the recipe you have to
be the last man left in the world-at
least in your world as you put it you
have to be alone before you can get
those things to happen-alone and all
ready to let your sense be imposed
upon

  he raised a hand and took the ciga-
rette from between his lips then he

lifted his head a little as though to
answer me but he did not speak for
a moment or two instead he stood
staring off into space

  oh my god he said in a quick
gasp - and before i had quite realized
that lie had spoken the quietness of
the house was shattered by a sudden
tumult of sound

  it was the bell

  there on the wall before us the bell
had most unmistakably rung it clam-
ored out through the quietness with a
suddenness that struck on the sense like
a mallet blow and with it it seemed-
to carry a note of desolation of vague
misery attempting to articulate itself
which sent a tingle arrowing up and
down my startled body

  in a moment i was out of my chair
running toward the door instead of
opening the door as ryckman expected
me to do i dropped on my knees before
the torn-up floor boards there i thrust
my hand through the opening and
firmly grasped the pull wire i held it
tight so that it could not be moved
but even as i held it motionless the
silence was again shattered by that un-
earthly brazen clamor

  it will ring again ryckman was
saying in a voice that sounded as thin
as though it had come to me over a
long-distance wire

  neither of us spoke as the third sig-
nal sounded and died away then i
ran to where ryckman stood with a
scattering of high lights on his mois-
tened forehead i put my hand on his
arm i think i must have shaken him

  can you get me another lamp i
asked him

  he did not answer me but in the
face staring over my shoulder i could
see sudden terror i could see the lips
become flaccid and the eyes alter and
widen and i knew that behind me
was a something which had entered his
line of vision a something which it was
my duty to face
the bell



  i turned slowly about forlornly
struggling to fortify myself for any-
thing with which i might be confronted
then i leaned forward with one hand
on the chair back giving vent as i did
so to a little challenging call that was
as foolish and futile as the squeak of
a frightened mouse

  for there before our eyes was a fig-
ure in white moving across the shad-
owy end of the hall the figure was
that of a woman still young

  i stood staring at her face which
seemed rapt and luminous i could see
the delicately chiseled nose and the line
of the white cheek that merged into
the slender chin i could see the mouth
with the lips slightly parted and then
i saw something else it was a trivial
thing but it drove the cold chill out
of my legs that apparition which i
had tried to tell myself had been con-
jured up by overtense nerves and too
active imagination had moistened its
lips

  even as i stepped forward i heard
ryckman call out the next moment
the place was filled with the reverbera-
tions of a quick report i saw the
vague figure in white wheel halfway
round throw out an arm and go down
on the floor it was only then that i
realized that ryckman had made use of
his rifle and it was only then that i
had the intelligence to clear the space
between my chair and the far end of
the hall

  bring the lamp i called for i
rather think youve killed a woman 

  i was down on my knees before a
tangle of white cotton drapery pad-
ding foolishly about a warm body which
seemed hopelessly enmeshed in its
swathings i was exploring and feel-
ing frantically about trying to find the
bullet wound

  its there in her shoulder said
ryckman with a choke in his voice
i could hear the lamp shade rattle
against its holder in his shaking hand

  i was clumsily but determinedly cut-
ting away the wet sleeve with my pock-
etknife when the bluest eyes i have
ever looked into opened and stared up
at me and then suddenly closed again

  its here in the arm i cried out
as i got the wet sleeve away fetch
me something for a tourniquet quick

  he was back with enough linen and
lint to outfit a red cross camp

  im better at this than you are
he said as he dropped on his knees
and elbowed me aside i want you
to get a doctor

  how i demanded

  can you run a car he was busy
tightening the tourniquet

  no

  then youll have to telephone from
the tishburn farm theres a rural
line there that connects with egerton
corners take my fur motor coat
and follow the trail until you come to
the main road where we turned in

  and then what i asked as i
struggled into the coat

  the tishburns will tell you the rest
he said without looking up for he was
busy making a pillow for the tumble-
haired headso close beside him

  but do you know who this woman
is i demanded

  yes i do he retorted

  who is she

  shes the daughter of the man who
built this house

iv

  it was two hours later that the prac-
ticing physician of egerton corners
drove up to the tishburn farmhouse
he came in a cutter that looked about
as big as a conch shell and drove a
team of spanking bays he wore a
coonskin hat and a greatcoat of the
same outlandish fur looking like a
cross between a submarine monster and
an eskimo in spectacles

  so i duly said good-by to the tish-


the cpopullcr magazine

burns-who had all promptly arisen and
dressed and joined me about their sit-
ting-room base-burner waiting avid-
eyed for some inkling as to why a doc-
tor should  be called up at such un-
seemly hours-and climbed in beside
that fur-smothered practitioner who
further barricaded me beneath a pon-
derous buffalo robe

  he waved his whip to the cluster of
faces peering from the lighted window
touched his bays on their steaming
flanks and chuckled audibly as we
swung down into the lake road

  now i understand why you gave
me the message in latin he said from
the depths of his furs nodding back
toward the crowded casement

  its the sort of thing one has  to
keep quiet i explained

  naturally he agreed but id
like a few of the particulars neverthe-
less

  i told him as briefly as i could what
had happened that night he took it
all as a matter of course-that is with
the one exception of ryckman

  this man ryckman is a bit eccen-
tric isnt he

  i remembered how i had been el-
bowed aside and dumped out into the
night to say nothing of being brought
four hundred miles to hear a bell ring

 most eccentric i admitted for
one so young

  ive always thought as much said
the man at my side

  it was my turn to surrender to un-
due curiosity and put a question to
him

  who in the world icasually in-
quired could that young woman be

  the fur-clad figure tooled his team
in through the broken-down stone gate-
posts of pine brae

  oh thats old captain hudsons
daughter she and her brother live
in the cottage just beyond the old or-
chard there

  but he would say nothing more
ryckman himself once we were back
in the house was equally reticent of
speech he already seemed to look on
me as an outsider an interloper when
i told him a little wearily that i
thought id be going back with the doc-
tor in the morning he did not even
demur he merely said it was a nasty
flesh wound but that the patient was
doing nicely and they would have a
trained nurse there by noon

  but how about that bell i in-
quired

  he was carrying towels and hot water
upstairs to the doctor he stopped only
long enough to regard me with a cold
and unsympathetic eye

  how dyou expect me to talk about
bells when ive got a sick woman to
look after was his quite ungenerous
and altogether unsatisfactory answer

  it was not until the end of january
that i heard from ryckman he had
been busy he said installing his hot-
water heating system and finishing up
his frohman comedy

  you will be glad to know he con-
tinued that catherines arm is quite
healed she asked me to explain to
you about the bell

  they had told her that if the family
could retain possession of pine brae
until over the new year their legal
claim in the matter of that disputed
title i told you about would be un-
assailable the bell kept ringing be-
cause she had a key to the passageway
and could step into the cellar and pull
the wire overhead when she felt it
would do the most good shes a won-
derful girl buchner even though she
did try to frighten me out of a per-
fectly good home and into a psycho-
pathic ward and it seems only fair
to confide to you remembering the
generous part you played in it all that
catherine and i are to be married the
second week in february


hatever we have worth keep-
ing needs care if we are to en-
joy its possession books are defaced
and torn pictures are hidden with
dust furniture loses its beauty silver
grows tarnished through neglect we
have possessions of an immaterial sort
much more valuable than anything we
can handle or touch aspiration hope
ideals are all much more necessary to
a sound and happy life than anything
bought with money they direct the
current of our thought and feeling give
light and color to an existence that
would be dull and meaningless with-
out them they may awaken and set
free at rare moments that better genius
that sleeps in every man and that has
been responsible for all great heroism
and achievement

	

        ideals our conceptions of what
was beautiful or noble or true
came to us new-wrought and gleam-
ing like the picture covered with
dust they may come to lose their mean-
ing they need attention if they are
to remain valuable to us religion-
every one whether he knows it or not
has some sort of religion-may come to
be a meaningless formula the celebra-
tion of christmas which in spite of
war and suffering is in the air in all
parts of the world to-day may de-
velop into a hypocritical and ceremonial
nuisance

jt is well to remember now the first
impression that christmas gave us
surely there was a time for almost
every one when the words merry
christmas meant something more
than a salutation something really
bright and generous and glowing
surely the christmas trees and presents
of long ago are not quite forgotten
surely there was a time when a christ-
mas dinner was really a great and mem-
orable feast if we have any such mem-
ories we know that they are ours partly
by virtue of one of the oldest and
certainly the most beautiful of human
traditions and partly through the devo-
tion and unselfishness of those who in
other days were simple and wise enough
to honor the tradition and obey it

a a

it is true that those who give us the
most happiness are often beyond the
reach of our gratitude we owe them
something-but it cannot be paid back
the most we can do is to do as they
did and hand the light and blessing
to others who have come later and
whom we benefit without hope of re-
ward after all is not this a higher
and better form of gratitude is it
not the fruit of the seed of christianity
itself a natural and spontaneous mani-
festation of that spirit which continu-
ally strives to break down the barriers
of family or race or prejudice and to
build a greater commonwealth of all
  a chat with you-continued

mankind  is it not a tribute to the
truth and vitality of that spirit that
in spite of war or disaster in spite of
shifting philosophies and failing creeds
christmas is the one universal holiday
still observed over all the world

a a

jp he principles of christianity are
something quite beyond professed
religion or formal creed to deny their
force and truth to-day in the presence
of the terrible struggle of a world war
is easy so is it easy to deny the fact
that honesty is the best policy in the
face of a successful bank burglary
christianity may fail in appearance now
as it has in the past like all great
truths it needs time and breadth of
application to prove its veracity if
there were only one believer in the doc-
trines of unselfishness forgiveness and
consideration in the world he would
scarce live a day the wider spread
the application of the idea the truer it
becomes for centuries the charm the
artistic and spiritual beauty of the
spirit kept it alive the time is com-
ing when it will shine forth as a living
practical truth even in the literal sense
thousands died for it protesting to the
last the greatness and truth of the con-
ception now it becomes evident that
it is more than a help to a noble death 
it is the finest and happiest way to live

a a

we like christmas best because it
is the most significant of chris-
tian holidays a celebration of the
awakening of nature from the death-
like sleep of winter long antedated our
easter and is as old as thor and odin
themselves they had temples and re-

ligious services long before abraham
founded his race ra and osiris zeus
and apollo sun gods and earth divini-
ties have been prayed to and sung to
from time immemorial and some of
our meaningless customs date back to
such misty days the little tassels on
the umbrella that always get in the way
were originally acorns acorns come
from the oak and the oak was sacred
to zeus who threw the thunderbolts
so they were a great protection in a
thunderstorm christmas however is
a newer idea the thought of good
will to all mankind is so new that we
are still struggling with the conception
we cant of course live up to it or feel
it all year just yet but for one day
we ought to do it and have a good time
doing it too

if a

js it practical to interrupt our daily
business to decorate house and hall
with evergreens to give to those from
whom we expect nothing if we go
through it as an empty form it is mean-
ingless and worse than impractical
for the  word without the spirit is a
mockery if we can remember our own
happiness if we can still feel the glow
of gratitude we do well to try to con-
vey it to others we are helping to
keep bright and inviolate one of the
good gifts that once received none but
ourselves can ever deprive us of
