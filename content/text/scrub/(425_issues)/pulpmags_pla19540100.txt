 dear editor

 pardon my grammar and realize the point which i would make
 clear in a recent issue alfreda runyon had a meritorious icttec
the vizigraph

run she put into words what should be in civiliza-
tions modes and morals i shall epitomize her views
sex is not ugly except to the neurotic mind the
fact that generations of ignorance and superstition
has debased mans attitude toward sex into some-
thing far less than god intended it is no where
more evident than in the science of psychology 
consider the latter a science even though learned men
do not evidence has been put forth that sexual
mania propensities are mostly artificially induced

  in that forgotten era when sex became thought of
as evil to be kept clandestine man made his greatest
egregious blunder in his blind stupid haste for its
condemnation he even forgot to label it clearly as
any semanticist will confirm the word sex is im-
possible to define universally another interesting
fact about the symbolic representation of sex is that
the words describing sex are almost all of a derog-
atory nature

  sex is mortality perhaps man has built up all
the taboos on sex because he wishes to conceal the
fact of his mortality if that be the reason then man
should realize by now that the noxious effects from
such a childish notion are too great for its continua-
tion

  when  see various magazines displaying the
human form in different stages of nudity  both
condemn and condone them while they are putting
into practice what i advocate their motives are too
selfish to eulogize

  i understand the difficulty in making a good cover
circulation demands that cheesecake be displayed
enticingly now personally i do not have anydiing
against seeing the cover girl stripped naked in an
intelligently planned painting but when a beautiful
body is thrown into a space merely for mercenary
reasons that seems nothing short of sacrilegious
anderson is an inveterate doer of just that of
course i realize that pulp covers are not meant to
be artistic masterpieces but that does not mean
they should be meaningless things of form color
and line

  why not have wood do a cover though he is
known chiefly as a cartoonist i think he could rank
with finlay if given an opportunity all i can see
wrong with his art is that he gives unnecessary
details and chronically draws his figures too short
and stocky

  sometimes i think god made the critic so the
artist could suffer enough to be creative

  if anyone wishes to question my viewpoints on
sex just take off your shoes and wade in but
remember the water is deep

  why is everybody so set against bryan berry as
he said himself he does not rate such a deluge of
comment his works are not that good or bad and
to say that his style is similar to ray bradbury is
as ridiculous as inferring that zane grey wrote
like victor hugo

  in both the july and september issues james
mckinney jr had a short story i was not shocked
by where the gods decide but i was nau-
seated by the banality of it it was so full of cliches
that i cannot conceive why it should ever be printed
junior however proved that he could write some-
thing worth absorbing in death star not men-
tioning close seconds i considered his piece the
best one in the edition

  bertha sundet chose to specify that she believed
in a god of creation a being so omnipotent that he
can control the cosmos so omniscient as to know
what is best for mankind and so omnipresent as to
be near man and at the same time at the borders of
infinity perhaps such visions are merely thought-

formed by a piece of gray matter that is old and

senile or young and iconoclastic

  the sept ps appeared and on the cover the
magic name of leigh brackett    ah brac-
kett    brackett of ebony towers rising from the
crimson sward    brackett of spiraling castle-like
fortresses  of silent aeons old martian cities
of deep valleys between ivory mountains  of
crystal lakes cobwebbed catacombs flashing swords
huge hairy-chested men leathery-skinned martians
ships sailing unknown seas alien temples with
bloodstained altars dark windtossed forests forgot-
ten gods golden haired warrior maidens surging
white tipped waves crashing against gray walled
cliffs  of caravans bright with colors moving
across the red ash deserts of a dying world  of
quiet stealthy footsteps sudden soft murmurs of
pain and jeweled daggers reflecting for a moment
a spark of silver light from the twin moons   
of poised lances which hurl themselves up from die
surface of the planet on scarlet columns of fire   
of the sound of trumpets echoing through mist
enshrouded valleys  of eric john stark with the
cold gray eyes of an angry eagle  a giant of a
man with sand scarred sweating blood stained
body who stands unafraid among a host of enemies
   eric john stark   a wanderer an adventurer
a restless man who is doomed to search always for
something he will never find with stark i have
fought in dark alleyways sailed strange seas crossed
endless sand dunes under a blazing sun stood in
shadowy corridors in great palace halls in strange
flowered gardens and in white crevices between ice
covered mountains  i have felt the chill of cold
on far planets and the heat of alien suns  i have
hung suspended between two poles and felt the
lashing bite of a whip crashing against my body
until small streams of blood like mountain streams
in the spring flowed down the length of it    and
have known the moment when the pain was for-
gotten when the thongs holding me before my
laughing captors held    when i faced them no
longer a wounded beaten man    but a blood-mad
beast  i have known the feel of silk-soft golden
hair and the touch of red lips    sea kings of

have taken a talent like that possessed by lin carter

a sound of thunder

by ray bradbury
back sixty million years hurtled the time machine suns fled and
ten million moons fled after them    and eckels-the avid
hunter-learned his paradise was the land hed just departed

 the sign on the wall seemed to quaver
 under a film of sliding warm water
 eckels felt his eyelids blink over his
 stare and the sign burned in this momentary
 darkness

 time safari inc

 safaris to any year in the past

you name the animal

we take you there

 you shoot it

 a warm phlegm gathered in eckels
 throat he swallowed and pushed it down

the muscles around his mouth formed a
smile as he put his hand slowly out upon
the air and in that hand waved a check for
ten thousand dollars to the man behind
the desk

  does this safari guarantee i come back

alive

  we guarantee nothing said the official
except the dinosaurs he turned this is
mr travis your safari guide in the past
hell tell you what and where to shoot if
he says no shooting no shooting if you

 disobey instructions theres a stiff penalty
 of another ten thousand dollars plus pos-
 sible government action on your return

   eckels glanced across the vast office at a
 mass and tangle a snaking and humming of
 wires and steel boxes at an aurora that
 flickered now orange now silver now blue
 there was a sound like a gigantic bonfire
 burning all of time all the years and all
 the parchment calendars all the hours piled
 high and set aflame

   a touch of the hand and this burning
 would on the instant beautifully reverse
 itself eckels remembered the wording in
 the advertisements to the letter out of chars
 and ashes out of dust and coals like golden
 salamanders the old years the green years
 might leap roses sweeten the air white hair
 turn irish-black wrinkles vanish all every-
 thing fly back to seed flee death rush down
 to their beginnings suns rise in western
 skies and set in glorious easts moons eat
 themselves opposite to the custom all and
 everything cupping one in another like
 chinese boxes rabbits into hats all and
 every tiling returning to the fresh death
 the seed death the green death to the
 time before the beginning a touch of
 a hand might do it the merest touch of

 	hand

   hell and damn eckels breathed the
 light of the machine on his thin face a
 real time machine he shook his head
 makes you think if the election had gone
 badly yesterday i might be here now run-
 ning away from the results thank god
 keith won hell make a fine president of
 the united states

   yes said the man behind the desk
 were lucky if deutscher had gotten in
 wed have the worst kind of dictatorship
 theres an anti-everything man for you a
 militarist anti-christ anti-human anti-
 intellectual people called us up you know
 joking but not joking said if deutscher
 became president they wanted to go live in
  of course its not our business to
 conduct escapes but to form safaris any-
 v iy keiths president now all you got to
 worry about is-

   shooting my dinosaur eckels finished
 a for him

   a tyramiosatirus rex the thunder
 lizard the damnedest monster in history

 sign this release anything happens to you
 were not responsible those dinosaurs are
 hungry

   eckels flushed angrily trying to scare
 me

   frankly yes we dont want anyone
 going wholl panic at the first shot six
 safari leaders were killed last year and a
 dozen hunters were here to give you the
 damnedest thrill a real hunter ever asked
 for traveling you back sixty million years
 to bag the biggest damned game in all time
 your personal checks still there tear it
 up

   mr eckels looked at the check for a long
 time his fingers twitched

   good luck said the man behind the
 desk mr travis hes all yours

   they moved silently across the room
 taking their guns with them toward the
 machine toward the silver metal and the
 roaring light

 thirst a day and then a night and then
 - a day and then a night then it was day-
 night-day-night-day a week a month a
 year a decade ad  ad  
  gone the machine roared

   they put on their oxygen helmets and
 tested the intercoms

   eckels swayed on the padded seat his
 face pale his jaw stiff he felt the trembling
 in his arms and he looked down and found
 his hands tight on the new rifle there were
 four other men in the machine travis the
 safari leader his assistant lesperance and
 two other hunters billings and kramer
 they sat looking at each other and the
 years blazed around them

   can these guns get a dinosaur cold
 eckels felt his mouth saying

   if you hit them right said travis on
 the helmet radio some dinosaurs have
 two brains one in the head another far
 down the spinal column we stay away
 from those thats stretching luck put your
 first two shots into the eyes if you can
 blind them and go back into the brain

the machine howled time was a film
run backward suns fled and ten million
moons fled after them good god said
eckels every hunter that ever lived would
envy us today this makes africa seem like
illinois
a sound of thunder



  the machine slowed its scream fell to a
murmur the machine stopped

  the sun stopped in the sky

  the fog that had enveloped the machine
blew away and they were in an old time a
very old time indeed three hunters and two
safari heads with their blue metal guns
across their knees

  christ isnt born yet said travis
moses has not gone to the mountain to
talk with god the pyramids are still in the
earth waiting to be cut out and put up
remember that alexander caesar napo-
leon hitler-none of them exists

  the men nodded

  that-mr travis pointed-is the
jungle of sixty million two thousand and
fifty-five years before president keith

  he indicated a metal path that struck off
into green wilderness over steaming
swamp among giant ferns and palms

  and that he said is the path laid
by time safari for your use it floats six
inches above the earth doesnt touch so
much as one grass blade flower or tree
its an anti-gravity metal its purpose is to
keep you from touching this world of the
past in any way stay on the path dont
go off it i repeat dont go off for any
reason if you fall off theres a penalty
and dont shoot any animal we dont okay
why asked eckels 

  they sat in the ancient wilderness far
birds cries blew on a wind and the smell
of tar and an old salt sea moist grasses
and flowers the color of blood

  we dont want to change the future
we dont belong here in the past the gov-
ernment doesnt like us here we have to
pay big graft to keep our franchise a time
machine is damn finicky business not
knowing it we might kill an important
animal a small bird a roach a flower even
thus destroying an important link in a
growing species

  thats not clear said eckels

  all right travis continued say we
accidentally kill one mouse here that means
all the future families of this one particular
mouse are destroyed right

  right

  and all the families of the families of
tiie families of that one mouse with ft
stamp of your foot you annihilate first one

then a dozen then a thousand a million
a billion possible mice

  so theyre dead said eckels so
what

  so what travis snorted quietly
well what about the foxes thatll need
those mice to survive for want of ten mice
a fox dies for want of ten foxes a lion
starves for want of a lion all manner of
insects vultures infinite billions of life
forms are thrown into chaos and destruc-
tion eventually it all boils down to this
fifty-nine million years later a cave man
one of a dozen on the entire world goes
hunting wild boar or saber-tooth tiger for
food

  but you friend have stepped on all
the tigers in that region by stepping on one
single mouse so the cave man starves and
the cave man please note is not just any
expendable man no he is an entire future
nation from his loins would have sprung
ten sons from their loins one hundred sons
and thus onward to a civilization destroy
this one man and you destroy a race a
people an entire history of life it is com-
parable to slaying some of adams grand-
children the stomp of your foot on one
mouse could start an earthquake the effects
of which could shake our earth and destinies
down through time to their very founda-
tions

  with the death of that one cave man
a billion others yet unborn are throttled in
the womb perhaps rome never rises on its
seven hills perhaps europe is forever a
dark forest and only asia waxes healthy
and teeming step on a mouse and you crush
the pyramids step on a mouse and you
leave your print like a grand canyon
across eternity queen elizabeth might
never be born washington might not cross
the delaware there might never be a
united states at all so be careful stay on
the path never step off

  i see said eckels then it wouldnt
pay for us even to touch the grass

correct crushing certain plants

  vj could add up infinitesimally a little
error here would multiply in sixty million
years all out of proportion of course
maybe our theory is wrong maybe time
cant be changed by us or maybe it can be


planet stories

changed only in little subtle ways a dead
mouse here makes an insect imbalance there
a population disproportion later a bad
harvest further on a depression mass
starvation and finally a change in social
temperament in far-flung countries some-
thing much more subtle like that perhaps
only a soft breath a whisper a hair pollen
on the air such a slight slight change that
unless you looked close you wouldnt see it
who knows who really can say he knows
we dont know were guessing but until
we do know for certain whether our mess-
ing around in time can make a big roar or
a little rustle in history were being damned
careful

  this machine this path your cloth-
ing and bodies were sterilized as you know
before the journey we wear these oxygen
helmets so we cant introduce our bacteria
into an ancient atmosphere

  how do we know which animals to
shoot

  theyre marked with red paint said
travis today before our journey we sent
lesperanee here back with the machine
he came to this particular era and followed
certain animals

  studying them

  right said lesperanee i track them
through their entire existence noting which
of them lives longest very few how many
times they mate not often lifes short
when i find one thats going to die when
a tree falls on him or one that drowns in a
tar pit i note the exact hour minute and
second i shoot a paint bomb it leaves a
red patch on his nide we cant miss it
then i correlate our arrival in the past so
that we meet the monster not more than
two minutes before he would have died
anyway this way we kill only animals with
no future that are never going to mate
again you see how careful we are

  but if you came back this morning in
time said eckels eagerly you mustve
bumped into us our safari how did it turn
out was it successful did all of us get
through-alive

  travis and lesperanee gave each other a
look

  thatd be a paradox said the latter
time doesnt permit that sort of mess-a
roan meeting himself when such occasions

threaten time steps aside like an airplane
hitting an air pocket you felt the machine
jump just before we stopped that was us
passing ourselves on the way back to the
future we saw nothing theres no way of
telling if this expedition was a success if
we got our monster or whether all of us-
meaning you mr eckels-got out alive

  eckels smiled palely

  cut that said travis sharply every-
one on his feet

  they were ready to leave the machine

  the jungle was high and the jungle was
broad and the jungle was the entire world
forever and forever sounds like music and
sounds like flying tents filled the sky and
those were pterodactyls soaring with caver-
nous gray wings gigantic bats out of a
delirium and a night fever eckels balanced
on the narrow path aimed his rifle play-
fully

  stop that said travis dont even aim
for fun damn it if your gun should go
off-

  eckels flushed wheres our tyranno-
saurus

  lesperanee checked his wrist watch up
ahead well bisect his trail in sixty seconds
look for the red paint for christs sake
dont shoot till we give the word stay on
the path stay on the path

  they moved forward in the wind of
morning

  strange murmured eckels up ahead
sixty million years election day over keith
made president everyone celebrating and
here we are a million years lost and they
dont exist the things we worried about
for months a lifetime not even born or
thought about yet

  safety catches off everyone ordered
travis

 you first shot eckels second billings
third kramer

  ive hunted tiger wild boar buffalo
elephant but man this is it said eckels
im shaking like a kid

  ah said travis

  everyone stopped

  travis raised his hand ahead he
whispered in the mist there he is theres
his royal majesty now

  the jungle was wide and full of twitter-
ings rustlings murmurs and sighs
a sound of thunder



  suddenly it all ceased as if someone had
shut a door

   silence

  a sound of thunder

  out of the mist one hundred yards away
came tyrannosaurus rex

  good heavens whispered eckels

  sh

   it came on great oiled resilient striding
legs it towered thirty feet above half of
the trees a great evil god folding its deli-
cate watchmakers claws close to its oily
reptilian chest each lower leg was a piston
a thousand pounds of white bone sunk in
thick ropes of muscle sheathed over in a
gleam of pebbled skin like the mail of a
terrible warrior each thigh was a ton of
meat ivory and sleel mesh and from the
great breathing cage of the upper body
those two delicate arms dangled out front
arms with hands which might pick up and
examine men like toys while the snake
neck coiled and the head itself a ton of
sculptured stone lifted easily upon the sky
its mouth gaped exposing a fence of teeth
like daggers its eyes rolled ostrich eggs
empty of all expression save hunger it
closed its mouth in a death grin it ran its
pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes
its taloned feet clawing damp earth leaving
prints six inches deep wherever it settled
its weight it ran with a gliding ballet step
far too poised and balanced for its ten tons
it moved into a sunlit arena warily its
beautifully reptile hands feeling the air

  my god eckels twitched his mouth
it could reach up and grab the moon
sh travis jerked angrily he hasnt
seen us yet

  it cant be killed eckels pronounced
this verdict quietly as if there could be no
argument he had weighed the evidence
and this was his considered opinion the
rifle in his hands seemed a cap gun we
were fools to come this is impossible
shut up hissed travis

  nightmare

  turn around commanded travis
walk quietly to the machine well remit
one half your fee

  i didnt realize it would be this big
said eckels i miscalculated thats all and
now i want out

   it ssej us

  theres the red paint on its chest

  the thunder lizard raised itself its
armored flesh glittered like a thousand
green coins the coins crusted with slime
steamed in the slime tiny insects wriggled
so that the entire body seemed to twitch and
undulate even while the monster itself did
not move it exhaled the stink of raw flesh
blew down the wilderness

  get me out of here said eckels it
was never like this before  was always sure
id come through alive i had good guides
good safaris and safety this time i figured
wrong ive met my match and admit it
this is too much for me to get hold of

  dont run said lesperance turn
around hide in the machine

  yes eckels seemed to be numb he
looked at his feet as if trying to make them
move he gave a grunt of helplessness

  eckels

  he took a few steps blinking shuffling

  not that way

  the monster at the first motion lunged
forward with a terrible scream it covered
one hundred yards in four seconds the
rifles jerked up and blazed fire a wind-
storm from the beasts mouth engulfed them
in the stench of slime and old blood the
monster roared teeth glittering with sun

  eckels not looking back walked blindly
to the edge of the path his gun limp in his
arms stepped off the path and walked not
knowing it in the jungle his feet sank into
green moss his legs moved him and he
felt alone and remote from the events
behind

  the rifles cracked again their sound was
lost in shriek and lizard thunder the great
lever of the reptiles tail swung up lashed
sideways trees exploded in clouds of leaf
and branch the monster twitched its
jewelers hands down to fondle at the men
to twist them in half to crush them like
berries to cram them into its teeth and its
screaming throat its boulder-stone eyes
leveled with the men they saw themselves
mirrored they fired at the metallic eyelids
and the blazing black iris

  like a stone idol like a mountain aval-
anche tyrannosazris fell thundering it
clutched trees pulled them with it it
wrenched and tore the metal path the men
flung themselves back and away the body


planet stories

 hit ten tons of cold flesh and stone the
 guns fired the monster lashed its armored
 tail twitched its snake jaws and lay still
 a fount of blood spurted from its throat
 somewhere inside a sac of fluids burst
 sickening gushes drenched the hunters
 they stood red and glistening

   the thunder faded

   the jungle was silent after the aval-
 anche a green peace after the nightmare
 morning

   billings and kramer sat on the pathway
 and threw up travis and lesperanee stood
 with smoking rifles cursing steadily

   in the time machine on his face eckels
 lay shivering he had found his way back
 to the path climbed into the machine

 rpravis came walking glanced at eckels
 took cotton gauze from a metal box and
 returned to the others who were sitting on
 the path

   clean up

   they wiped the blood from their helmets
 they began to curse too the monster lay
 a hill of solid flesh within you could hear
 the sighs and murmurs as the furthest
 chambers of it died the organs malfunction-
 ing liquids running a final instant from
 pocket to sac to spleen everything shutting
 off closing up forever it was like standing
 by a wrecked locomotive or a steam shovel
 at quitting time all valves being released or
 levered tight bones cracked the tonnage
 of its own flesh off balance dead weight
 snapped the delicate forearms caught un-
 derneath the meat settled quivering

   another cracking sound overhead a
 gigantic tree branch broke from its heavy
 mooring fell it crashed upon the dead
 beast with finality

   there lesperanee checked his watch
 right on time thats the giant tree that
 was scheduled to fall and kill this animal
 originally he glanced at the two hunters
 you want the trophy picture

   what

   we cant take a trophy back to the
 future the body has to stay right here
 where it would have died originally so the
 insects birds and bacteria can get at it as
 they were intended to everything in bal-
 ance the body stays but we can take a
 picture of you standing near it

   the two men tried to think but gave up
 shaking their heads

   they let themselves be led along the
metal path they sank wearily into the
machine cushions they gazed back at the
ruined monster the stagnating mound
where already strange reptilian birds and
golden insects were busy at the steaming
armor

   a sound on the floor of the time
machine stiffened them eckels sat there
shivering

    im sorry he said at last

   get up cried travis

   eckels got up

     go out on that path alone said travis
 he had his rifle pointed youre not com-
 ing back in the machine we re leaving
 you here

   lesperanee seized travis arm wait-
 stay out of this travis shook his hand
 away  this son of a bitch nearly killed us
 but it isnt that so much hell no its his
 shoes look at them he ran off the path
 my god that ruins us who knows how
 much we ll forfeit tens of thousands of
 dollars of insurance we guarantee no one
 leaves the path he left it oh the damn
 fool ill have to report to the government
 they might revoke our license to travel
 god knows what hes done to time to
 history

   take it easy all he did was kick up
 some dirt

   how do we know cried travis we
dont know anything its all a damn mys-
stery get out there eckels

   eckels fumbled his shirt ill pay any-
 thing a hundred thousand dollars

   travis glared at eckels checkbook and
 spat go out there the monsters next to
 the path stick your arms up to your elbows
 in his mouth then you can come back
 with us

     thats unreasonable 

   the monsters dead you yellow bastard
 the bullets the bullets cant be left behind
 they dont belong in the past they might
 change something heres my knife dig
 them out

   he returned shuddering five minutes
later his arms soaked and red to the elbows
he held out his hands each held a number
of steel bullets then he fell
a sound of thunder



   he lay where he fell not moving

   you didnt have to make him do that
 said lesperance

    didnt i its too early to tell travis
 nudged the still body hell live next
 time he wont go hunting game like this
 okay he jerked his thumb wearily at
 lesperance switch on lets go home

     

    they cleaned their hands and faces they
 changed their caking shirts and pants eckels
 was up and around again not speaking
 travis glared at him for a full ten minutes

     

   the machine stopped

    get out said travis

the room was there as they had left it
but not the same as they had left it
the same man sat behind the same desk
but the same man did not quite sit behind
the same desk

   travis looked around swiftly every-
thing okay here he snapped

   fine welcome home

   travis did not relax he seemed to be
lookixig at the very atoms of the air itself
at the way the sun poured through the one
high window

    okay eckels get out dont ever come
 back

   eckels could not move

   you heard me said travis whatre
you staring at

    eckels stood smelling of the air and there
 was a thing to the air a chemical taint so
 subtle so slight that only a faint cry of his
 subliminal senses warned him it was there
 the colors white gray blue orange in the
 wall in the furniture in the sky beyond
 the window were    were    and there
 was a feel his flesh twitched his hands
 twitched he stood drinking the oddncss
 with the pores of his body somewhere
 someone must have been screaming one of
 those whistles that only a dog can hear his
 body screamed silence in return beyond
 this room beyond this wall beyond this
 man who was not quite the same man seated
 at this desk that was not quite the same
 desk  lay an entire world of streets and
 people what sort of world it was now

 there was no telling he could feel them
 moving there beyond the walls almost like
 so many chess pieces blown in a dry
 wind   

   but the immediate thing was the sign
 painted on the office wall the same sign he
 had read earlier today on first entering

   somehow the sign had changed

   tyme sefari inc

   sefaris tu any yeer en the past

   yu naim the animall

   wee taek yu thair

   yu shoot itt

    eckels felt himself fall into a chair he
 fumbled crazily at the thick slime on his
 boots he held un a clod of dirt trembling

    no it cant be not a little thing like
 that no

    embedded in the mud glistening green
 and gold and black was a butterfly very
 beautiful and very dead

    not a little thing like that not a but-
 terfly cried eckles

    it fell to the floor an exquisite thing a
 small thing that could upset balances and
 knock down a line of small dominoes and
 then big dominoes and then gigantic dom-
 inoes all down the years across time
 eckels mind whirled it couldnt change
 things killing one butterfly couldnt be
 that important could it

    his face was cold his mouth trembled
 asking who-who won the presidential
 election yesterday

    the man behind the desk laughed you
 joking you know damn well deutscher
 of course who else not that damn weak-
 ling keith we got an iron man now a
 man with guts by god the official
 stopped whats wrong

 eckels moaned he dropped to his knees
 he scrabbled at the golden butterfly with
 shaking fingers cant we he pleaded to
 the world to himself to the officials to the
 machine cant we take it back cant we
 make it alive again cant we start over
 cant we-

 he did not move eyes shut he waited
 shivering he heard travis breathe loud in
 the room he heard travis shift his rifle
 click the safety catch and raise the weapon

 there was a soun of thunder

 b-s moon glow

            by charles a stearns

        among the metal-persons of phobos robot - held a
        special niche he might not have been stronger larger
        faster than some but he could be devious and more im-
        portant he was that junkyard planetoids only moonshinerm

i am b- a metal person if you read
day and the other progressive journals
you will know that in some quarters of
the galaxy there is considerable prejudice di-
rected against us it is ever so with minority
races and i do not complain i merely make
this statement so that you will understand
about the alarm clock

  an alarm clock is a simple mechanism
used by the builders to shock themselves
into consciousness after the periodic comas
to which they are subject it is obsolescent

but still used in such out of the way places
as phobos

  my own contact with one of these de
vices came about in the following manner
i had come into argon city under cover
of darkness which is the only sensible thing
to do in my profession and i was stealing
through the back alleyways as silently as my
rusty joints would allow

  i was less than three blocks from bennys
place and still undetected when i passed
the window it was a large cheerful oblong




planet stories

of light so quite naturally i stopped to in-
vestigate being slightly phototropic by vir-
tue of the selenium grids in my rectifier
cells i went over and looked in unob-
trusively resting my grapples on the outer
ledge

  there was a builder inside such as i had
not seen since i came to phobos half a cen-
tury ago and yet i recognized the subspecies
at once for they are common on earth it
was a she

   it was in the process of removing certain
outer sheaths and i noted that while quite
symmetrical bilaterally it was otherwise
oddly formed being disproportionately
large and lumpy in the anterior ventral re-
gion

   i had watched for some two or three min-
utes entirely forgetting my own safety
when the she saw me its eyes widened and
it snatched up the alarm clock which was
as i have hinted near at hand

   get out of here you nosey old tin can
it screamed and threw the clock which
caromed off my headpiece damaging one
earphone i ran

   if you still do not see what i mean about
racial prejudice you will when you hear
what happened later

  i continued on until i came to bennys
place entering through the back door
benny met me there and quickly shushed
me into a side room his fluorescent eyes
were glowing with excitement

  bennys real name is bne- and when
on earth he had been only a servitor not
a general purpose like myself

  but perhaps i should explain

  we metal people are the children of the
builders of earth and later of mars and
venus we were not born of two parents
as they are that is a function far too com-
plex to explain here in fact i do not even
understand it myself no we were born of
the hands and intellects of the greatest of
their scientists and for this reason it might
be natural to suppose that we and not they
would be considered a superior race it is
not so

  many of us were fashioned in those days
a metal peison for every kind of task that
they could devise and some like myself
who could do almost anything we were
contented enough for the greater part but

the scientists kept creating always striving
to better their former efforts

  and one day the situation which the
builders had always regarded as inevitable
but we somehow had supposed would
never come was upon us the first genera-
tion of the metal people-more than fifty
thousand of us-were obsolete the things
that we had been designed to do the new
ones with their crystalline brains fresh
untarnished accomplished better

  we were banished to phobos dreary
lifeless moon of mars it had long been a
sort of interplanetary junkyard now it be-
came a graveyard

upon the barren face of this little world
there was no life except for the handful
of hardy martian and ter ran prospectors
who searched for minerals later on a few
rude mining communities sprang up under
plastic airdromes but never came to much
argon city was such a place

  i wonder if you can comprehend the lone-
liness the hollow futility of our plight
fifty thousand skilled workmen with noth-
ing to do some of the less adaptable gave
up prostrating themselves upon the bare
rocks until their joints froze from lackof
use and their works corroded others served
the miners and prospectors but their needs
were all too few

  the overwhelming majority of us were
still idle and somehow we learned the
secret of racial existence at last we learned
to serve each other

  this was not an easy lesson to learn in
the first place there must be motivation in-
volved in racial preservation yet we de-
rived no pleasure out of the things that
make the builders wish to continue to live
we did not sleep we did not eat and we
were not able to reproduce ourselves and
besides this latter as i have indicated
would have been pointless with us

  there was however one other pleasure
of the builders that intrigued us it can best
be described as a stimulation produced by
drenching their insides with alcoholic com-
pounds and is a universal pastime among
the males and many of die shes

  one of us-r- i think it was rest
him-tried it one day he pried open the
top of his helmet and poured an entire bot-
b- moon glow



tic of the fluid down his mechanism

  poor r- he caught fire and blazed up
in a glorious blue flame that we could not
extinguish in time he was beyond repair
and we were forced to scrap him

  but his was not a sacrifice in vain he had
established an idea in our ennui-bursting
minds an idea which led to the discovery
of moon glow my discovery i should say
for i was the first

  naturally i cannot divulge my secret
formula for moon glow there are many
kinds of moon glow these days but there
is still only one b- moon glow

  suffice it to say that it is a high octane
preparation only a drop of which-but you
know the effects of moon glow of course

  how the merest thimbleful when judi-
ciously poured into ones power pack gives
new life and the most deliriously happy
freedom of movement imaginable one
possesses soaring spirits and super-strength

  old rusted joints move freely once more
ones transitors glow brightly and the cur-
rents of the body race about with the mi-
nutest resistance moon glow is like being
born again

  the sale of it has been illegal for several
years for no reason that i can think of ex-
cept that the builders who make the laws
can not bear to see metal people have fun

  of course a part of the blame rests on
such individuals as x- who when lu-
bricated with moon glow insists upon
dancing around on large cast-iron feet to
the hazard of all toes in his vicinity he is
thin and long jointed and he goes creak
creak in a weird sing-song fashion as he
dances it is a shameful ludicrous sight

  then there was dc- who tore down the
 feet long equipment hangar of the
builders one night he had over-indulged

i do not feel responsible for these things
if i had not sold them the moon glow
someone else would have done so besides
i am only a wholesaler benny buys every-
thing that i am able to produce in my little
laboratory hidden out in the dumps

  just now by bennys attitude i knew that
something was very wrong what is the
matter i said is it the revenue agents

  i do not know said bne- in that
curious flat voice of his that is incapable of

inflection i do not know but there are
visitors of importance from earth it could
mean anything but i have a premonition of
disaster jon tipped me off

  he meant jon rogeson of course who
was the peace officer here in argon city and
the only one of the builders i had ever mot
who did not look down upon a metal per-
son when sober he was a clever person who
always looked out for our interests here

  what are they like i asked in some
fear for i had six vials of moon glow with
me at the moment

  i have not seen them but there is one
who is high in the government and his
wife there are half a dozen others of the
builder race and one of the new type metai
persons

  i had met the she who must have been
the wife they hate us i said we can
expect only evil from these persons

  you may be right if you have any mer-
chandise with you i will take it but do not
risk bringing more here until they have
gone

  i produced the vials of moon glow and
he paid me in phobos credits which are
good for a specified number of refueling
at the central fueling station

  benny put the vials away and he went
into the bar there was the usual jostling
crowd of hard-bitten earth miners and of
the metal people who come to lose their
loneliness i recognized many though i
spend very little time in these places pre-
ferring solitary pursuits such as the distilla-
tion of moon glow and improving my
mind by study and contemplation out in the
barrens

  jon rogeson and i saw each other at the
same time and i did not like the expression
in his eye as he crooked a finger at me f
went over to his table he was pleasant look-
ing as builders go with blue eyes less dull
than most and a brown unruly topknot of
hair such as is universally affected by them

  sit down he invited revealing his
white incisors in greeting

  i never sit but this time i did so to be
polite i was wary ready for anything i
knew that there was something unpleasant
in the air i wondered if he had seen me
passing the moon glow to benny somehow
perhaps he had barrier-penetrating vision


planet stories

like the z group of metal people    but i
had never heard of a builder like that i
knew that he had long suspected that i made
moon glow

  what do you want i asked cautiously
come on now he said loosen up
limber those stainless steel hinges of yours
and be friendly

  that made me feel good actually i am
somewhat pitted with rust but he never
seems to notice for he is like that i felt
young as if i had partaken of my own
product

   the fact is b- he said i want you
to do me a favor old pal

  and what is that

  perhaps you have heard that there is
some big brass from earth visiting phobos
this week

   i have heard nothing i said it is often
helpful to appear ignorant when questioned
by die builders for they believe us to be
incapable of misrepresenting the truth the
fact is though it is an acquired trait and
not built into us we general purposes can
lie as well as anyone

  well there is a federation senator
no less simon f langley its my job to
keep them entertained thats where you
come in

   i was mystified i had never heard of tlis
langley but i know what entertainment is
i had a mental image of myself singing or
dancing before the senators party but i
can not sing very well for three of my voice
reeds are broken and have never been re-
placed and lateral motion for me is almost
impossible these days i do not know what
you mean i said there is j- he was
once an entertainment-

  no no he interrupted you dont get
it what the senator wants is a guide
theyre making a survey of the dumps
though ill be damned if i can find out why
and you know the dumps better than any
metal person-or human-on phobos

  so that was it i felt a vague dread a
premonition of disaster i had such feelings
before and usually with reason this too
was an acquired sensibility i am sure for
many years i have studied the builders and
there is much to be learned of their mobile
faces and their eyes in jons eyes however
i read no trickery-nothing

  yet i say i had the sensation of evil it
was just for a moment no longer

  i said i would think it over

enator langley was distin-
guished jon said so and yet he was
cumbersomely round and he rattled inces-
santly of things into which i could interpret
no meaning the she who was his wife was
much younger and sullen and unpleasantly
i sensed great rapport between her and jon
rogeson from the very first

  there were several other humans in the
group-i will not call them builders for i
did not hold them to be in any way supe-
rior to my own people they all wore spec-
tacles and they gravitated about the round
body of the senator like minor moons and
i could tell that they were some kind of
servitors

  i will not describe them further

   ms- i will describe i felt an uncon-
scionable hatred for him at once i can not
say why except that he hung about his
master obsequiously power pack smoothly
purring and he was slim limbed nickel-
plated and wore i thought a smug ex-
pression on his viziplate he represented the
new order the ones who had displaced us
on earth he knew too much and showed
it at every opportunity

  we did not go far that first morning the
half-track was driven to the edge of the
dumps within the dumps one walks-or
does not go phobos is an airless world and
yet so small that rockets are impractical the
terrain is broken and littered with the
refuse of half a dozen worlds but the
dumps themselves-that is different

  imagine if you can an endless vista of
death a sea of rusting corpses of space
ships and worn-out mining machinery and
of those of my race whose power packs
burned out or who simply gave up retiring
into tliis endless corroding limbo of the
barrens a more sombre sight was never
seen

  but this fat ghoul langley sickened me
this shame of the builder race this atavism
-this beast-rubbed his fat impractical
hands together with an ungod-iike glee
excellent he said far far better in
fact than i had hoped he did not elu-
cidate
b-irs moon glow



  i looked at jon rogeson he shook his
head slowly

  you there-robot said langley look-
ing at me how far across this place
the word was like a blow i could not an-
swer

  ms- glistening in the dying light of
mars strode over to me clanking heavily
up on the black rocks he seized me with
his grapples and shook me until my wiring
was in danger of shorting out speak up
when you are spoken to archaic mech-
anism he grated

  i would have struck out at him but what
use except to warp my own aging limbs

  jon rogeson came to my rescue on
phobos he explained to langley we
dont use that word robot these folk
have been free a long time theyve quite
a culture of their own nowadays and they
like to be called metal people as a return
courtesy they refer to us humans as build-
ers just a custom senator but if you want
to et along with them-

   can they vote said langley grinning
at his own sour humor

  nonsense said ms- i am a robot
and proud of it this rusty piece has no call
to put on airs

  	release him langley said droll fel-
lows these discarded robots really nothing
but mechanical dolls you know but i think
the old scientists made a mistake giving
them such human appearance and such ob-
stinate traits

  oh it was true enough from his point
of view we had been mechanical dolls at
first i suppose but fifty years can change
one all i know is this we are people we
think and feel and are happy and sad and
uite often we are borea stiff with this
reary moon of phobos

  it seared me my selenium cells throbbed
white hot within the shell of my frame and
i made up my mind that i would learn more
about the mission of this langley and i
would get even with ms- even if they
had me dismantled for it

  of die rest of that week i recall few
pleasant moments we went out every day
and the quick-eyed servants of langley
measured the areas with their instruments
and exchanged significant looks from be-

-pianet-january

hind their spectacles smug in their thin air
helmets it was all very mysterious and
disturbing

  but i could discover nothing about their
mission and when i questioned ms- he
would look important and say nothing
somehow it seemed vital that i find out what
was going on before it was too late

  on the third day there was a strange oc-
currence my friend jon rogeson had been
taking pictures of the dumps langley and
his wife had withdrawn to one side and
were talking in low tones to one another
quite thoughtlessly jon turned the lens on
them and clicked the shutter

  langley became rust-red throughout the
vast expanse of his neck and face here
he said what are you doing

  nothing said jon

  you took a picture of me snarled
langley give me the plate at once

  jon rogerson got a bit red himself he
was not used to being ordered around ill
be damned if i will he said

  langley growled something i couldnt un-
derstand and turned his back on us the
she who was called his wife looked startled
and worried her eyes were beseeching as
she looked at jon a message there but i
could not read it jon looked away

  langley started walking back to the half-
track alone he turned once and there was
evil in his gaze as he looked at jon you
will lose your job for this impertinence he
said with quiet savagery and added enig-
matically not that there will be a job after
this week anyway

  builders may appear to act without rea-
son but there is always a motivation some-
where in their complex brains if one can
only find it either in the seat of reason or
in the labyrinthine inhibitions from their
childhood i knew this because i had studied
them and now there were certain notions
that came into my brain which even if i
could not prove them were no less inter-
esting for that

the time had come to act i could
scarcely wait for darkness to come
there were tilings in my brain that appalled
me but i was now certain that i had been
right something was about to happen to
phobos to all of us here-i knew not what
	plane 

  but i must prevent it somehow

     i kept in the shadows of the shabby build-
  ings of argon city and i found the win
  dow without effort the place where i had
  spied upon the wife of langley to my sor-
  row the other night there was no one there
  there was darkness within but that did not
  deter me

    within the airdrome which covers argon
  city the buildings are loosely constructed
  even as they are on earth i had no trouble
  therefore opening the window i swung a
  leg up and was presently within the dark-
  ened room i found the door i sought and
  entered cautiously in this adjacent compart-
  ment i made a thorough search but i did
  not find what i primarily sought-namely
  the elusive reason for langleys visit to
  phobos it was in a metallic overnight bag
  that i did find something else which made
  my power pack hum so loudly that i was
  afraid of being heard the thing which ex-
  plained the strangeness of the pompous sen-
  ators attitude today-which explained in
  short many things and caused my brain
  to race with new ideas

     i put the thing in my chest container and
  left as stealthily as i had come there had
  been progress but since i had not found
  what i hoped to find i must now try my
  alternate plan

     two hours later i found the one i sought
  and made sure that i was seen by him then
  i left argon city by the south lock fur-
  tively as a thief always glancing over my
  shoulder and when i made certain that i
  was being followed i went swiftly and it
  was not long before i was clambering over
  the first heaps of debris at the edge of the
  dumps

  once i thought i heard footsteps behind
me but when i looked back there was no
one in sight just the tiny disk of deimos
peering over the sharp peak of the nearest
ridge the black velvet sky outlining the
curvature of this airless moon

  presently i was in sight of home the
time-eaten hull of an ancient star freighter
resting near the top of a heap of junked
equipment from some old strip mining op-
eration it would never rise again but its
shell remained strong enough to shelter my
distillery and scant furnishings from any
chance meteorite that might fall

stories

    i greeted it with the usual warmth of
  feeling which one has for the safe and the
  familiar i stumbled over tin fuel cans
  wires and other tangled metal in my haste
  to get there

   it was just as i had left it the heating
  element under the network of coils and
  ressure chambers still glowed with white
  eat and the moon glow was dripping
  with musical sound into the retort

    i felt good no one ever bothered me
  here this was my fortress with all that i
  cafed for inside my tools my work my
  micro-library and yet i had deliberately-
  something-a heavy foot-clanked upon
  the first step of the manport through which
  i had entered

    i turned quickly the form shimmered
  in the pale deimoslight that silhouetted it
  ms-

    he had followed me here

    what do you want i said what are
  you doing here

    a simple question said ms- to-
  night you looked very suspicious when you
  left argon city i saw you and followed you
  here you may as well know that i have
  never trusted you ah the old ones were
  unreliable that is why you were replaced
  he came in boldly without being in-
  vited and looked around i detected a sneer
  is voice as he said so this is where you
  hide

     i do not hide i live here it is true

    a robot does not live a robot exists
  we newer models do not require shelter
  like an animal we are rust-proof and in-
  vulnerable he strode over to my micro-li-
  brary several racks of carefully arranged
  spools and fingered them irreverently
  what is this

  my library

  so our memories are built into us we
have no need to refresh them

  so is mine i said but i would learn
more than i know i was stalling for time
waiting until he made the right opening

    nonsense he said i know why you
stay out here in the dumps masterless i
have heard of the forbidden drug that ii
sold in the mining camps such as argon
city is this the mechanism he pointed
at the still

  now was the time i mustered all my
b- moon glow



cunning but i could not speak not yet

  never mind he said i can see that
it is i shall report you of course it will
give me great pleasure to see you dis-
mantled not that it really matters of
course-now

  there it was again the same frightening
allusion that langley had maae today i
must succeed

i knew that ms- for all his brilliance
and newness and vaunted superiority
was only a secretarial for the age of spe-
cialism was upon earth and general pur-
pose models were no longer made that was
why we were different here on phobos it
was why we had survived the old ones had
given us something special which the new
metal people did not have moreover ms-
 had his weakness he was larger strong-
er faster than me but i doubted that he
could be devious

  you are right i said pretending resig-
nation this is my distillery it is where i
make the fluid which is called moon glow
by the metal people of phobos doubtless
you are interested in learning how it works

  not even remotely interested he said
i am interested only in taking you back
and turning you over to the authorities

  it works much like the conventional dis-
tilling plants of earth i said except that
the basic ingredient a silicon compound
is irradiated as it passes through zirconium
tubes to the heating pile where it is acti-
vated and broken down into the droplets of
the elixir called moon glow you see the
golden drops falling there

   it has the excellent flavor of fine petro-
leum as i make it perhaps youd care to
taste it then you could understand that it
is not really bad at all perhaps you could
persuade yourself to be more lenient with
me

  certainly not said ms-

  perhaps you are right i said after a
moment of reflection i took a syringe drew
up several drops of the stuff and squirted
it into my carapace where it would do the
most good i felt much better

  yes i continued certainly you are
quite correct now that i think of it you
newer models would never bear it you
werent built to stand such things nor for

that matter could you comprehend the ex-
quisite joys that are derived from moon
glow not only would you derive no pleas-
ure from it but it would corrode your
parts i imagine until you could scarcely
crawl back to your master for repairs i
helped myself to another liberal portion

  	that is the silliest thing ive ever
heard he said

  what

  i said its silly we are constructed to
withstand a hundred times greater stress
and twice as many chemical actions as you
were nothing could hurt us besides it
looks harmless enough i doubt that it is
hardly anything at all

  for me it is not i admitted but
you-

  give me the syringe fool

  i dare not

  give it here

  i allowed him to wrest it from my grasp
in any case i could not have prevented him
he shoved me backwards against the rusty
bulkhead with a clang he pushed the noz-
zle of the syringe down into the retort and
withdrew it filled with moon glow he
opened an inspection plate in his ventral
region and squirted himself generously

  it was quite a dose he waited for a mo-
ment i feel nothing he said finally i
do not believe it is anything more than com-
mon lubricating oil he was silent for
another moment there is an ease of move-
ment he said

  no paralysis i asked

  paral- you stupid rusty old robot
he helped himself to another syringeful
of moon glow the stuff brought twenty
credits an ounce but i did not begrudge it
him

  he flexed his superbly articulated joints
in three directions and i could hear his
power unit building up within him to a
whining pitch he took a shuffling sidestep
and then another gazing down at his feet
with arms akimbo

  the light gravity here is superb superb
superb superb superb he said skipping a
bit

   isnt it i said

  almost negligible he said

  true

  you have been very kind to me ms-


planet stories

said extremely extraordinarily incompar-
ably incalculably kind he used up all the
adjectives in his memory pack i wonder
if you would mind awfully much if-

   not at all i said help yourself by
the way friend would you mind telling
me what your real mission of your party
is here on phobos the senator forgot to
say

   secret he said horribly top secret as
a dutiful subject-i mean servant-of
earth i could not of course divulge it to
anyone if i could- his neon eyes glis-
tened if i could you would of course be
the first to know the very first he threw
one nickel-plated arm about my shoulder

   i see i said and just what is it that
you are not allowed to tell me

   why that we are making a preliminary
survey here on phobos of course to de-
termine whether or not it is worthwhile to
send salvage for scrap earth is short of
metals and it depends upon what the old
ma-the master says in his report

   you mean theyll take all the derelict
spaceships such as this one and all the
abandoned equipment

   and the r-robots ms- said theyre
metal too you know

   theyre going to take the dismantled
robots

  ms- made a sweeping gesture
theyre going to take all the r-robots
dismantled or not theyre not good for
anything anyway the bill is up before the
federation congress right now and it will
pass if my master langley says so he pat-
ted my helmet consolingly his grapples
clanking if you were worth a damn you
know- he concluded sorrowfully

   thats murder i said and i meant it
mans inhumanity to metal people i
thought yes-to man even if we were
made of metal

   hows that said ms- foggily
have another drop of moon glow i
said ive got to get hack to argon city

i made it back to bennys place without
incident i had never moved so swiftly
i sent benny out to find jon rogeson and
presently he brought him back

  i told rogeson what ms- had said
watching his reaction carefully i could not

forget that though he had been our friend
he was still one of the builders a human
who thought as humans

  you comprehend i said grimly that
one word of this will bring an uprising of
fifty-thousand metal people which can be
put down only at much expense and with
great destruction we are free people the
builders exiled us here and therefore lost
their claim to us we have as much rightto
life as anyone and we do not wish to be
melted up and made into printing presses
and space ships and the like

   the damn fools jon said softly lis-
ten b- youve got to believe me i didnt
know a thine about this though ive sus-
pected something was up im on your side
but what are we going to do maybe theyll
listen to reason vera-

  that is the name of the she no they
will not listen to reason they hate us i
recalled with bitterness the episode of alarm
clock there is a chance however i have
not been idle this night if you will go get
langley and meet me in the back room here
at bennys we will talk

   but hell be asleep

  awaken him i said get him here
your own job is at stake as well remem-
ber

  ill get him jon said grimly wait
here

  i went over to the bar where benny was
serving the miners benny had always been
my friend jon was my friend too but he
was a builder i wanted one of my own
people to know what was going on just in
case something happened to me

  we were talking there in low tones
when i saw ms- he came in through the
front door and there was purposefulness
in his stride that had not been there when i
left him back at the old hulk the effects of
the moon glow had worn off much quicker
than i had expected he had come for venge-
ance he would tell about my distillery
and that would be the end of me there
was only one thing to do and i must do it
fast

  quick i ordered benny douse the
lights he complied the place was
plunged into darkness i knew that it was
darkness and yet you comprehend  still
sensed everything in the place for i had
b- moon glow



the special visual sensory system bequeathed
only to the general purposes of a bygone
age i could see but hardly anyone else
could i worked swiftly and i got what i
was after in a very short time i ducked out
of the front door with it and threw it in a
silvery arc as far as i could hurl it it was an
intricate little thing which could not i am
sure have been duplicated on the entire
moon of phobos

  when i returned someone had put the
lights back on but it didnt matter now
ms-  was sitting at one of the tables star-
ing fixedly at me he said nothing benny
was motioning for me to come into the back
room i went to him

  jon rogeson and langley were there
langley looked irritated he was mumbling
strangled curses and rubbing his eyes

  rogeson laughed you may be interested
in knowing b- that i had to arrest him
to get him here this had better be good
 it is all bad i said very bad-but nec-
essary i turned to langley it is said that
your present survey is being made with the
purpose of condemning all of phobos the
dead and the living alike to the blast fur
naces and the metal shops of earth is this
true

  why you impudent miserable piece of
tinl what if i am making a scrap survey
what are you going to do about it youre
nothing but a ro-

  so it is true but you will tell the sal-
vage ships not to come it is yours to decide
and you will decide that we are not worth
bothering with here on phobos you will
save us

  i blustered langley

  you will i took the thing out of my
breastplate container and showed it to him
he grew pale

  jon said well ill be damned

  it was a picture of langley and another
i gave it to jon his wife i said his
real wife i am sure of it for you will note
the inscription on the bottom

  then vera-

  is not his wife you wonder that he was
camera shy

  housebreaker roared langley its a
plot a dirty reactionary plot

  it is what is called blackmail i said

i	turned to jon i am correct about this

  you are jon said

  you are instructed to leave phobos i
said to langley and you will allow my
friend here to keep his job as peace officer
for without it he would be lost i have ob-
served that in these things the builders are
hardly more adaptable than their children
the metal people you will do all this and
in return we will not send the picture that
jon took today to your wife nor otherwise
inform her of your transgression for i am
told that this is a transgression

   it is indeed agreed jon gravely right
langley

  all right langley snarled you win
and the sooner i get out of this hole the
better he got up to go squeezing his fat
form through the door into the bar past
the gaping miners and the metal people
heedless of the metal jpeople we watched
him go with some satisfaction

  it is no business of mine i said to
jon but i have seen you look with longing
upon the she that was not langleys wife
since she does not belong to him there is
nothing to prevent you from having her
should not that make you happy

  are you kidding he snarled

  which proves that i have still much to
learn about his race

  out front langley spied his metal ser-
vant ms- just as he was going out the
door he turned to him what are you
doing here he asked suspiciously

  ms- made no answer he stared ma-
levolently at the bar ignoring langley

  come on here damn you langley said
ms- said nothing langley went over to
him and roared foul things into his ear-
phones that would corrode ones soul if
one had one i shall never forget that mo-
ment the screaming rcd-faced langley
the laughing miners

  but he got no reply from ms- not
then or ever and this was scarcely strange
for i had removed his fuse

of thrayx

            by fox b holden

and that is why you will take us to earth lieutenant
harked the ihelian warrior we do not want your arms
or your men what we must ask for is-
ten thousand women

 mason was nervous it was the nerv-
 ousness of cold apprehension not
 simply that which had become in-
 digenous to his high-strung make-up he
 was in his way afraid afraid that hed
 again come up with a wrong answer

   hed brought the tiny scout too close to
 the rim facing the facts squarely he knew
 even as he fingered the stud that would
 wrench them out of their r-curve that hed
 not just come too close hed overshot en-
 tirely pardonable perhaps from the view-
 point of the corps of scientists safely en-
 sconced in their ponderous mark vii ex-
 plorer some fifteen light-days behind but
 not according to the g-n manual according
 to it hed placed the scout and her small
 crew in a situation of avoidable risk and
 it would make a doubtful record look that
 much worse

   the next time hed out-argue cain with
 his rank if he had to cain was big enough
 to grab things with his brawny fists and
 twist them into whatever shape he wanted
 when the things were tangible solid resist-
 ing but r-space was something else again
 nobody knew what it did beyond the rim


planet stories

   he materialized the scout into e-space
listened for trouble from her computers
but they chuckled softly on keeping track
of where they were where theyd been and
how theyd get home

   it was as though nothing had happened
but lieutenant lansing mason was still
nervous his slender fingers steady enough
but as cold as the alien dark outside the
ship they controlled

   you look a little shot again skipper
cain said grinning like a martian desert cat
whats the matter space goblins got you
again

   a retort started at masons taut lips but
his third officer was already speaking

   heres a dope sheet from the comps if
anybodys interested in knowing iust where
outside the rim we are she said i make
it just a shade inside the outermost fringes
of the large magellanic cloud sergeant
judith kents voice had its almost habitually
preoccupied tone as though the words she
said were hardly more than incidental to a
host of more important thoughts running
iwiftly behind her wide-set deep gray eyes
they were serious eyes and in their way
matched the solemn set of her small features
and the crisp military cut of her black hair
and severe uniform

   our little boss-man knows where we are
ill right cain said

   mason gave cains six-feet-two a quick
glance wondering as he always wondered
why the big redheads shoulders always
seemed too broad for the warrant officers
stripes on them sergeant kents right
he said heres her comp-sheet you can
look for yourself fringe magellanic and
look at that while you can- he jabbed a
forefinger at the main scanner its screen
studded with unfamiliarly close constella-
tions-because were on our way back
set up a return on the comps will you
sergeant for all his tenseness his voice
was low and the words it formed were even
and swift

   hell lance this is the sort of stuff the
brain trust pays us bonuses for

   not out here they dont r-drive when
youre ready sergeant

   cain turned from the deep control bank
and gave his full attention to the scanner as
the -slender efficient girl started feeding a

tape of reversal co-ordinates into the com-
puters

   mason waited the few necessary seconds
pushed disarranged dark hair out of his eyes
and felt the clammy dampness on his fore-
head and wtished silently to himself that
opportunists like cain were kept where they
belonged-on the slam-bang run out of
caljisto thats where the money was
thats where a warrant like cain ought to
be

  ready sir he heard judith saying
quietly

  hey skipper there was a sudden
urgency in cains voice and the equally
sudden racket of an mpd alarm going off
cain was gesturing at the scanner stubby
finger tracing a slewing pip of light the
alarm stopped and judiths cool voice was
relaying information about a thousand
miles she was saying mass approxi-
mately three hundred tons speed-

but mason wasnt listening he was
watching the pip of light as cain got
the scanners directional going tracked it
suddenly there were others coming as
though to meet it and it swerved violently
obviously in flight and now there were
more yet this time from the starboard
quadrant of the screen

  radiation reading sergeant mason
clipped out

   while the two men watched judith read
back the cryptic information interpolated by
the ships mass-proximity detector

   thats not all engine junk cain ex-
claimed as she finished

   we dont know what drive theyve got
mason answered could be anything-

   nuts you wouldnt get that much from
an old-fashioned ion-blast skipper thats a
shooting war thats what it is there was
a glitter in cains narrowed brown eyes a
new edge on his heavy voice which side
do we take boss-man

  no side at all mason said hardly
moving his lips were getting the hell out
of here

   look lance weve got a crew of ten
-weve got a couple of m-guns aboard
because were a scout no telling how one
of those outfits may show their gratitude if
we pitch in help their side out thats what
the woman-stealers of thrayx



were out here for isnt it dig up new stuff
for the double-domes to sink their slide-
rules into think of the bonus skipper
hell this is made to order-

  mason turned a quick glance to the girl
but her face told him nothing it never did
when things like this came up between him-
self and cain and it was something he
knew he had no right to expect but he was
tired    too damn much space and there
was nothing else he knew how to do

  but this time cain had a point aliens-
extra-galactic even if almost neighbors-
and his help one way or the other could
mean an engraved invitation a key to the
city

  he turned back to the screen watched as
the careening pips massed mixed whirled
in an insensate jumble he didnt want anv
more mistakes theyd ground him for good
tell him hed had his limit of space and
park him on one of the rest-planets with a
pension for the rest of his life

  no he had to think and quickly

  earth had only too recently gotten an
entire history of wars out of her system
perhaps for good this time and that was
it that was his answer better keep his nose
clean-

  for gods sake skipper cain snapped
come out of it this is a natural well
clean up

  sergeant kent r-drive

  there was a moments sensation of noth-
ingness as the scout made the euclidean-
riemannian transition the scanner paled
and the segment of the universe it framed
twisted changed

-	cain didnt say anything he glowered
and mason could feel the big mans con-
tempt but he didnt have time for it

  this time there wouldnt be any error
this time hed be a step ahead of the situa-
tion and stay there scratch those reversal
co-ordinates sergeant set up to diverge
thirty degrees

  cains sarcasm was little disguised mind
if i ask a question

  just stay at ease mister cain until
were out of this

  mason watched the scanners distorted
image as die scout hurtled through a curved
pencil of four-point space she didnt have
a fraction of a powerful explorers speed

and her small powerframe physically limited
her to that of light yet it could be fast
enough for the aliens might know nothing
of transition technique or could be as wary
as earthmen of the rim his precautions
could be needless but he had seen them and
they were war-like and he had no inten-
tion of being followed either back to the
explorer or ultimately to earth itself hed
have to maintain the diverged course until
he was certain

  there was a black pip on the fog-colored
scanner judith saw it even as he did there
was a fleeting look of fright on her intent
young face that she hadnt been able to
mask

  cain saw it too

  you got a tail skipper he said and
the grin was back on his big freckled face

  cain was right the alien was capable of
transition and he obviously had little fear
of the rim his ship grew larger in the
scanner

  mason felt his fingers grow cold again

lance told the girl to eject the tape
of co-ordinates from the nav-compu-
ters and he took over manually hoping the
comps would keep up it would be up to
him where they went and up to the comps
to keep track of the scouts position rela-
tive to both the solar system and the ex-
plorer

  his fingers played across the control -
banks as though the were the keyboards of
a great organ and he felt his insides writhe
as he slipped the hurtling ship back into
e-space then back to r-level again he
played the tiny craft between levels as
though it were a stone skipping across
water and altered course with each transi-
tion with no attempt at plan or pattern
rivulets of ice water trickled down across
his ribs and the flesh of his thin face was
stiff

  wrong again he heard cain saying
at least we can tell the brain trust that
their precious r-factor is constant beyond
the rim    maybe thatll be worth a buck
or two at least those kids back there arc
playing around in this galaxy like it was
their own front yard go on skipper take
a look yourself

  mason didnt have to look he knrv that


planet stories

he hadnt lost the alien had known some-
how that he wouldnt be able to too
apparently their own galaxy near as it was
to the milky way was of the same space
its continuum forged in the same curvature
matrices

   shall i order our m-guns placed sir
it was judith and he knew she had grasped
the implications of the situation as quickly
as she always did sometimes he wondered
if she were a computer herself clad in the
graceful body of a young woman rather
than in a shell of permasteel and other
times   

   he didnt even think about his answer
the no was automatic

   ill give the order then myself cain
laid flatly

   as you were mister cain

   so its rank now is it and he was
grinning that damn grin again

   take it any way you want if you think
three meson cannon will stop a ship thats
obviously built for battle youre hardly
thinking well enough for the responsibili-
ties of your post

   well listen to whos sounding off so
were just going to let em overhaul us just
let em blast us out of space or coma
tramping aboard if they want to

  mason didnt reply he looked at the
scanner and now the alien craft was no
longer a dot but taking definite shape it
would be a couple of hours yet perhaps
and then it would have to be the way cain
had said

  the alien overhauled them hardly a
billion miles inside the rim and mason
offered no resistance when he felt their mag-
netics touch the scout and draw it gently to
the flank of their great ship it was necessary
to scale down the scanners field to see the
huge shape in its entirety beside it the
scout was like a sparrows egg

  he punched the stud that would swing
in the outer lock as the two craft touched
with but the slightest jar

   cains ham-like fists were knotted at his
sides and judith stood quietly as though
waiting for nothing more than the presence
of an inspecting officer but her delicate face
was white and mason wondered if the
brain under that crisp dark hair was still
functioning as a well disciplined piece of

machinery or if it felt the same fear that
was in his own he knew what was in
cains thoughts but at least when hed told
their small crew the score they had accepted
his decision-and his order to keep the
m-guns where they were so maybe this
time it was cain who was wrong

  the three of them stood in the compact
confines of the control bubble silent
waiting

   and when the alien stepped through their
inner airlock port and faced them mason
knew he was not succeeding in keeping his
surprise from his features

  the alien could have been human even
clad in his spacegear he was little taller
than cain and his hair and eyes could have
been those of an earthly viking of another
day humanoid so far as physical appear-
ances went but in thought-

  there was a smile on the viking face as
the alien removed the transparent globe of
his helmet he seemed to realize instinc-
tively that mason was the scouts com
mander

  i am kriijorl he said t extend the
greetings of ihelos and he proffered his
right hand earth fashion toward mason

   lance grasped it as he tried to organize
the sudden scramble of his thoughts it was
a strong hand he could feel the sinews of
it beneath its gauntlet like cains yet dif-
ferent somehow you are peacefully re-
ceived and welcome he said but there
was a hollow sound to his words that he
had not been able to help

   the smile still played on the aliens sun-
darkened face

  thank you i hope that i use your
language not too clumsily our teleprobes
may leave something to be desired in the
matter of semantics you will i hope for-
give us for taking the liberty of their use
but since you employed no protective
screens and because of the necessity of our
meeting-

   cain broke in without hesitation i dont
know what youve been up to while youve
been tagging us mister but i-

  at ease mister cain mason snapped
we must allow our guest to explain his
action and his mission

  the alien nodded slightly glanced at
judith
the woman-stealers of thrayx



tt was your woman officer aboard
-i- he began when we became aware
that you also represented a bi-sexual race as
do we we realized at once that you afforded
us an unexpected opportunity otherwise
we should nave remained at our business
and spared you this intrusion

   we of ihelos as you doubtless have
noted are at war it is perhaps not war as
your culture understands it it is perhaps
more accurately described by your word
feud i think and it has continued between
us and our only similar neighbor the planet
of thrayx for many thousands of your
years

   we have been quite self-sufficient cul-
tures for all that time and have taken great
care that our conflict not infect any other
area in either our galaxy or yours for
neither of us by inherent nature is war-like
in the sense of aggressiveness our conflict
is between us and us alone

   however we of ihelos recently received
a staggering setback from our traditional
enemy due to a certain unexpected innova-
tion in their battle techniques and we
realized that our cause could end only in
eventual defeat as it shall unless your
people will help us
tliere was a moment of silence and
mason found himself wondering how often
this had happened in earths own bitter
past it was wherever men lived an old
story

   what cain was asking is in this
for us

   could you tell us judith said before
the alien could answer cain just why you
chose us certainly you must have noticed
our techniques of warfare are quite inferior
to your own we have not employed them
for more than two hundred years-

   nor mason finished for her do we
intend to again you must seek help else-
where sir

   that for us would be quite impos-
sible the alien replied slowly the
chances of finding other life forms like our
own are billions to one the immensity of
both our galaxies notwithstanding had you
not ventured within range of our screens we
would in all probability never known you
existed and to organize a search  and
now the smile on his lips was almost a sad

thing a search of two galaxies-it would
take us aeons even at a thousand times the
speed of light simply to cover the vast dis-
tances involved to say nothing of finding a
similar life and thought form and we do
not have aeons lieutenant we have but
two-three at most-generations

   there is too little time to search for
allies we have no other choice as you can
see than to take what advantage we can of
those upon whom we may chance

   but as my sergeant has already pointed
out mason said our arms would be
worthless to you and more importantly
we wish no more part in warfare i am
afraid in that respect you must excuse ui
sir  it has been a pleasure to have you
aboard

   and suddenly the smile was gone from
the aliens face

   i must demand of you then-force you
if necessary-to take us to your planet
lieutenant for you can quite obviously
help us it is not your arms we want

    i fail to understand you sir mason felt
the icy sweat start again repressed a shiver
as it trickled the length of his spare body

   our planet as our enemys is encircled
by a wide ring of floating cosmic debris
the alien said in both instances the rings
are remnants of what once may have been
satellites in the ring which encircles us we
have successfully secreted refrigerated lead-
sheathed stores of male sperm quite impos-
sible for our enemy to locate that is ft
necessity of course for any race that if
constantly at war and is obliged to take all
possible safeguards to insure its continued
existence we assume that thrayx has done
the same

   however our cell stores are useless if
they lack ova to fertilize on their last
attack thrayxite ships succeeded in pene-
trating our innermost planetary defenses
and heavily damaged a number of our cities
many of our women and young were
victims

   we therefore evacuated our planets
entire female population to an uninhabited
world far distant it was a young world and
covered with thick forests much like the
labor planetoid which circles thrayx and
we believed our breeders would be quite
sufficiently camouflaged


planet stories

   breeders cain broke in

    our philosophy concerning women is
slightly different than your own the alien
said and then he resumed but in our
haste we underestimated our enemys clever-
ness thrayxite scouts located the planet
destroyed it our women and our seeds

  and that is why you will take us to
earth lieutenant we do not want your
arms or your men what we must ask for
is-ten thousand of your women

acepheid variable winked tauntingly
at the edge of the milky way the
large magellanic cloud strewn like dia-
monds in a vast cosmic spume behind it
it corruscated in glorious display as far off
a great silvery ship of space and a tiny jot
of man-made metal resumed their headlong
motion through the mighty legion of the
stars

   and then for an instant the cepheids
bright wink was dulled eclipsed a taper-
ing streamlined shape slipped silently across
it and then was gone in the blackness and
the white dwarf resumed its brilliant dis-
play

   ut the commander of the cepheids in-
terruptor had been giving little time to
appreciation of the myriad beauties in the
reat darkness that had swallowed her ship
he had trebled her screens and had taxed
her crafts colossal power installation to its
limit forcing it to absorb and reconvert
every erg of radiant energy possible as it
labored to maintain the awful output neces-
sary to cling to the very edge of r-space
barely clear of the e-continuum itself

  she might have been an amazon of
earth save for the great intelligence behind
the high plane of her forehead yet she was
not without beauty nor were those of her
ships complement on their close-fitting
uniforms were emblazoned the planet-and-
circle insignia of their homeland for they
were of the galactic hosts of thrayx

  they proceed toward a planet on the
near side of this galaxy called earth the
second officer said their mission is to re-
plenish their supply of breeders

   you are certain of that

   i admit it is peculiar for the breeders

they seek are women of that planet

  women

   yes however the earthmens minds in-
dicated a strong tendency to refuse cooper-
ation

  i see do you think our probe was

detected

   no i withdrew it immediately when the
earthmen were taken aboard the ihelian
destroyer

   there wras a long moment of silence
the commanders eyes stayed unwaveringly
on the control sphere mounted in gimbals
before her they remained concentrated on
it when she spoke again

   women you say hardly conceivable
daleb unless-unless it was not simply a
penal planetoid which we destroyed

   a startling thought lady

   yes and the earthmen you say did
not have cooperative thoughts

   that is correct they are not taking the
ihelian craft to their planet of their own
volition

   that is difficult to understand daleb
for the ihelians are like ourselves in at least
one respect they are not aggressors and if
they are refused their strange request they
will leave the planet earth peacefully but
if they are not refused it perhaps the earth-
mans superiors will cooperate daleb in
which case-

   whatever their mission it is our duty to
prevent its success lady but to do this
without violating the book without infect-
ing a foreign area of the galaxy with our
conflict

   i think there is a way the commander
said she twisted the sphere slightly and
again the two tiny pips it held were caught
squarely at the intersection of the curving
light traceries within it there is a way
she said give me a complete description
of the clothing these earthmen wore
daleb  

  a tapering streamlined shape slid
shadow-like across the face of an undulating
globular cluster and then was swallowed
quickly in the strange gray void of hyper-
space

mason and judith waited outside the
towering new united nations build-
ing in greater san francisco their chauf-
the woman-stealers of thrayx



feured government helio parked on a sky-
ramp adjacent to the three hundredth floor

  liiey waited for kriijorl they had been
assigned as earthmen best acquainted with
the alien as his official hosts during his stay
on their planet mason had protested but
judith had kept the protests from reaching
the wrong ears

  you wont make any mistakes youre
home now she had whispered after
all hes only human

  it had been the first time mason had
heard a hint of levity in her voice and he
had liked it and decided to take the assign-
ment gracefully and the orders said
sergeant judith kent went with the assign-
ment without cain

  he hardly felt nervous at all as they
waited for the ihelian to leave the general
council chamber

  wonder how he made out he said idly
offering the girl a self-lighting cigarette
been in there for hours

  well know soon enough she said
but i-i personally cant conceive of it
sir of course the new-un is very prac-
ticed in dealing with all kinds of cultures
remember the time they had with those
awful five-legged things from canis major
wanted to trade all the tritium wed need
to blow up a planet just for trees because
they worshipped trees any and all kinds
of trees

  mason smiled he was good looking
when he smiled and the space-tension was
gone from his slate colored eyes i remem-
ber but it looks as though theyre goin to
have the toughest time with somebody just
like us-two legs two arms oxygen-breath-
ing    women the man said tust what
the devil does he expect us to do draft
em have an international lot drawing

she smoked quietly and her gray eyes
were thoughtful a matter of view-
point sir she said finally as it always is
to them females are for breeding only to
keep their war machine well stocked rrom
what kriijorl said they do not understand
love as we do theres simply one pur-
pose 

  well thats why i think the whole
thing is-well as you say inconceivable
from our point of view our culture our

women just arent conditioned for such an
existence

  think back two centuries sir

  you dont have to keep calling me sir
like that mason said feeling a sudden
warmth at the back of his neck as he said it
and then two centuries back yes after
every war earths birth rate would go crazy
mother nature ruled the roost in those days
didnt she supply and demand cause and
etfect its a wonder man ever got any-
where

  more wonder some men do-

  mason looked up but judiths face was
as usual quite calm and detached you say
something

  i said id like to have you get kriijorl
to demonstrate that teleprooe thing of hi
for us if you can s- lance how did he
say it worked

   i still dont get it completely a peculiar
mixture of radio and the electroencephalo-
graph i think he said it replaced radio on
ihelos and thrayx centuries ago you can
communicate to a group or an individual
with it in language or in basic thought pic-
tures thats what they use it mostly for of
course and as such its termed a mentacom
but he told me that it can also be used as it
was on us as a teleprobe when the subject
isnt screened they use a specially tuned
carrier wave of some sort he said that im-
pinges on a diought wave pattern but in-
stead of registering the patterns electronic
impulse equivalents as does the electroen-
cephalograph it reflects them like a basic
radar system and the receiver its a tiny
thing breaks the reflected pattern down into
values equivalent to those in which the
listener thinks amplifies and that s it
mind reading made easy i guess

  judith squirmed a little uneasily im
glad theyre not natural telepaths anyway
she answered and even with a gimmick
like that-

  and then the conversation was lost as
kriijorl flanked by two new-un guides
strode from the building the stiff breeze
at three hundred stories of what had once
been called nob hill flicked his scarlet
short-cape behind him and rippled the broad
front ot his black and silver tunic

  he climbed into the helio with a smiled
greeting seated himself to judiths right as
ft

planet stories

he knew earth custom demanded and the
craft was lifting slowly over the central
area of the ancient city before mason spoke

  well how did they treat you in there

sir

  not as well as i had hoped kriijorl
answered your president-general spoke
with me privately after the world delegates
council met to question me and he held
out extremely little hope however the
issue is to be debated i think perhaps more
out of diplomatic courtesy than actual con-
sideration i am to be informed of the offi-
cial decision tomorrow 

  there were scientists present of
course

  yes you have brilliant men on earth
lieutenant they are good thinkers i am
certain they were interested in me for more
than the sole fact that i am an alien of a
race so precisely a replica of your own but
it is- again the old factor cultural difference
your entire world simply regards women
differently than we i imagine my request
to persons less learned than those with
whom i spoke would be quite shocking
anywhere on the planet

  perhaps judith murmured yet some-
how i wonder somehow i wonder how
much two hundred years has really changed
til our history in such things is not pleas-
ant kriijorl many of our women once gave
their bodies for money shock us im not
sure you really could for your breeders
simply give their bodies to produce the flesh
for war and there was a time when we did
that too

  there was silence between them for
a while and then lance began directing
the ihelians attention to points of interest
as the air phase of the diplomatic tour got
under way

  the blue-green beauty of the pacific
stretched lazily below them from the color-
ful california shore line to the west sur-
rounding air traffic was light and the tour
proceeded smoothly eastward over the
great divide and then swung north
kriijorl seemed impressed and grateful for
the momentary respite

it was near the end of the tours air
phase that mason remembered judith
request and kriijorl obliged with an

amused smile producing a personal men-
tacom for judith to examine

  and the receiver simply fits about the
head like earphones

  like this kriijorl said they were
nearing denver and air traffic at their level
had picked up and the helio was proceed-
ing more slowly so that kriijorls demon-
stration caused him to miss little of the
tour

  he fitted the compact headpiece to his
ears and flicked a small switch it was sud-
denly bathed in a warm orange glow this
way the device functions as a limited range
mentacom he began and then he flicked
the switch again and now as a teleprobe
you see i could tell you lady judith just
what-

  she flushed furiously but kriijorl had
suddenly stopped speaking his face had
blanched and a look of bewildered fury
was suddenly in his eyes

  lieutenant that air bus there he
pointed to a thick egg shaped vehicle speed-
ing to the north tell your chauffeur to

fursue it at once it carries a full passenger-
oad of earthwomen

  for a moment mason thought the
ihelian was attempting some strange joke
but a look at the mans face told him that
here was no joke that here was something
he was failing to understand

  earthwomen sure-

  plus two other beings lieutenant two
others using thrayxite probe screens

  on masons order the government chauf-
feur swiftly heeled the helio about those
buses can make nearly a full mach when
theyre wide open like that one he told
kriijorl we cant overtake them but
maybe we can keep up ill have the chauf-
feur try for radio contact-

  no no theyll be alert for any signs
of awareness of their presence wait-
the ihelian made a third adjustment on
the mentacom and it emitted a slight hum-
ming sound and the orange glow vanished
this will screen us for a short period at
least he said and if weve not been
already detected perhaps well be able to
follow if youll continue to help me
lieutenant-

  looks as though theyve got some of
ours doesnt it mason said evenly there
the woman-stealers of thrayx

si

was a strange heat in his veins now and
with the ihelian his nervousness was some-
how evaporated but how the devil-
they are clever lieutenant we were
somehow followed here even as we at first
followed you in your scout ship we may
have been probed before you were taken
aboard our screened destroyer

   but you said nothing about destroying
their breeders judith said above the
throbbing roar of the helios fast acceler-
ating jets why would they want- and
she let the sentence die as comprehension
snapped in her gray eyes her dark slender
eyebrows arched nearly together as she
pushed the thought further

   the borderlands of canada sped beneath
them and then there was pine forest but
the helio kept the fleeing bus in sight even
as the shadows of a dying day crept inex-
orably from the east to engulf them and
then abruptly the bus had started down

   theyre hanging a neat frame on you
sir mason said making certain you dont
get the women you ask by kidnaping some
they plan sure as hell to make it look as
though ihelian desperation is responsible
and bingo your sides in the dog house in
nothing flat no deal

   theyre damnably cunning kriijorl
said it will not be the first time they have
come near making utter fools of us i cant
understand that

   but how would they have gotten those
women judith asked the helio was slant-
ing downward and was now less than five
miles distant from the fast vanishing bus
it began to skim the tree tops of a great
tract of spruce its chauffeur awaiting
masons signal to drop quickly out of their
quarrys line of sight

   video ads of course mason answered
quickly straining his tensed eyes to estimate
distance in the fast gathering darkness
some big deal spaceliner hostess at twice
the going rate of payment anything like
that 

   the bus finally vanished less than a half-
mile ahead of masons helio and there was
a dark vertical shadow jutting just above
the tree tops he knew it was one of their
shuttle boats and from its apparent size
would easily hold all the bus would be able
to carry-perhaps a full three hundred he

gave orders quickly to the chauffeur and
then the helio was hovering inches above
the tree tops and he tossed a plastiweave
ladder over the side

   dont use the radio he snapped to
judith just get back to new-un head-
quarters inform them any way possible of
whats going on and then flash the air
patrol and tell em to come gunning

   he didnt give her a chance to argue he
simply swung over the helios side kriijorl
after him and within moments they were
on the ground and running with what
silence they could through the darkness
toward the towering thrayxite ship a
quarter-mile distant

   their action is incomprehensible to me
the ihelian grunted between gulps of air
it violates the most basic tenets of the
ancient book of the saints sacred to us
both-

   better save your breath for running
mason told him and they sprinted across
the soft pine needle forest floor shielding
their eyes from treacherous low hanging
boughs dodging the trees themselves as
best they could in the moonlit darkness

   and they burst upon the clearing in
which the thrayxite ship had landed almost
before realizing it

   mason caught a glimpse of earthwomen
being led as though drugged into the yawn-
ing flank of the silent vessel

  there was a sudden movement in the
darkness to his left and he heard the
start of an outcry on the ihelians lips but
it was all he heard or saw there was a
quick knifing pain in his skull and he
crumpled to the ground

ill

ou may wait in here sergeant the
new-un orderly said she was ush-
ered into a small comfortably appointed
chamber adjoining the main conference hall
and the perfectly controlled coolness of her
bearing was at its peak to the casual glance
of the orderly perhaps it flawlessly masked
the vital convictions which had long seethed
within her and made her the little known
woman she was the studied mask itself
had made her the efficient space officer she
was and at the moment she was glad for it


planet stories

because it also concealed the anxious uncer-
tainty that twisted coldly inside her

  she was to wait the council had in-
formed her wart while the information
she had given them was analyzed digested
as though perhaps what she had said was
part of some insidious plot as though it
were too fantastic to be the truth

  they had not even immediately author-
ized the dispatch of a patrol cruiser to the
spot where shed left lance and kriijorl
over two hours ago and bv now-

   she tried not to think of what the earth-
man and the ihelian might be facing alone
and in the darkness nor of the conclusions
to which the council called into emergency
session by the president general himself
when her information had been rapidly re-
layed through the correct channels to him
might arrive

   she could only wait

   and her waiting was terminated with an
abrupt suddenness that made the twisting
cold thing inside her a churning confusion
it had been only minutes hardly minutes

  only one of them came into the small
room where she sat she rose quickly to
attention it was an aide to the president
general himself a brevet-colonel wearing
the uniform of the world police

   sergeant kent he said it is the coun-
cils decision that you be placed under
temporary arrest your case will be heard
at the next sitting of the martial court to
which your unit is assigned if you will
accompany me please 

   may i ask sir what the charge against
me is her voice was steady by cultivated
habit

  you are to be held on suspicion of
acting as accessory before and after the fact
of conspiring to assist an alien power in the
achievement of its objective within the gov-
ernmental jurisdiction of earth without
official permission of the new united
nations 

   but the ihelians have not done that sir
she protested it is a plot of their enemy
as i explained to the council-

   you will be given full benefit of due
legal process sergeant the officer said
you will come with me please

  the womens detainment barrack was
not unpleasant yet judith thought it may

as well have been a medieval dungeon but
her own problem she knew was nothing
beside the cunning success of the thrayxites

  the call-buzzer at the side of her bunk
interrupted her thoughts it meant she was
wanted in the main guard room she
straightened her uniform quickly and
within moments presented herself before
the barrack warden

  roger cain stood beside the wardens
desk there was something white in his
hand and she knew what it was

  youre at liberty sergeant kent the
beefy-faced warden informed her in a tone
as casual as though shed asked her for a
cigarette warrant officer cain has posted
a release voucher youre ordered into his
custody until your trial thats all you
may go

  she left the barrack with cain word-
lessly none of it made sense unless-

  well dont i even get a thank you
the red-haired giant asked

  yes mister cain sorry but i dont
understand-

  why i did it he chuckled and she
didnt like the sound of it im only too
glad to have you in my custody young
woman and you know youre not sup-
posed to be out of my sight any-that is
any of the time

   she felt her face redden and spun about
to face him there was sudden anger at her
lips and her coolness had evaporated

  you contempti-

   easy there sergeant always knew there
was a little more to you than that ice cube
exterior of yours but tell me-dyou want
to sit back there in that dump or shall we
stick our noses into the lovely mixup your
precious lieutenant mason has set oft

  she stared up at him wordlessly the
blood hot in her cheeks and she tried to
think this was cain as she knew he was
this was roger cain angling for a deal

  im in your custody she bit out i
must stay within your sight that is your
responsibility

  he laughed at her then gripped her
elbow

  come on he said ive got a r-ix
waiting at the field i think we should go
on a little trip sergeant there are people
i want to see
the woman-stealers of thrayx



  they were streaming for open space with-
in less than thirty minutes from the time
cain had freed her she didnt ask him how
hed gotten permission for the fleet r-ixs
use or how hed obtained her voucher nor
did she ask him how he had learned of what
had happened to lance and kriijorl yet she
knew that somehow he was aware of the
tlirayxites and their plot cain had ways of
learning the things he wanted to learn
getting the things he wanted to get

  keep an eye on the scanner for me will
you beautiful

   yes sir

   and forget that sir stuff look judy-
for what do you want me to watch
sir

  cain grunted gave a shrug of his power-
ful shoulders and turned his attention back
to the pursuits compact control console

  two blips honey tearing hell-for-
leather out of old sols little family onell
be chasing the other if my guess is any
good we want the front one

  but-but that would be the-

  the thrayxite crowd right

  for a moment she was silent she knew
he could not mean to attack not with a tiny
pursuit swift as it was

  mister cain i can only guess at what
you intend doing but it will be my privilege
in court to testify concerning your conduct
of custodianship-

  you must be working on the assump-
tion that were going back there sweet-
heart

  -you-m

  a deal is where you find it watch for
that front blip sergeant with what we
know of kriijorl and his crowd this oughta
be a natural

r i the cubicle in which he awoke was softly
-l lit and the painful throb mason knew
should be splitting his head apart was
strangely absent kriijorl was bending over
him loosening the tightness of the military
collar at his throat

  they certainly were taking no chances
with you he said his long vikings hair
was matted with blood just above the
temple yet he seemed to be suffering little
pain himself  how do you fed

i-planet-january

  ok i guess dont feel anything
really  kriijorl unbuckled the wide
straps that held him solidly in an accelera-
tion-hammock and he sat up the steel-
walled room rocked for a moment then
steadied

  the thrayxites are not vicious any more
than we if they do not kill outright they
apparently take medical precaution to see
that their victims suffer as little pain as
possible were captives however together
with your earthwomen weve been in
flight for about an hour putting us well
out of your system if were hyperdriving-
moving in what you term r-space
then-

  apparently no help of any kind arrived
in time lieutenant

  mason remembered then judith   
somehow she hadnt made it or hadnt
made them believe her this trip he was
strictly on his own not just a space weaiy
scout lieutenant any more

  whatll they do with us

  pump us for information probably kill
me afterward you should be safe enough
in that respect youre an alien not a part
of our conflict their labor planetoid for
you i would imagine it is a jungle covered
sphere at the edge of their planetary ring
our scouts have sighted it on numerous
occasions a handful of men in each of its
camps mining probably for the ore used
in thrayxite engines but it will be better
than death

  what are our chances kriijorl mason
felt the familiar nervousness returning to
his wiry body yet this time it was in some
way different not the kind that ate your
insides out from too much space for too
long

  of escape you mean mason nodded
there is no reason for you to risk-

  sure as hell is friend first because i
believe youre my friend second there were
a couple of things you said awhile back
that got me thinking and third i got
myself shanghaied and i dont think ill
like where im going cain mason
thought to himself wasnt the only guy in
the universe with a muscle

  the ihelian grinned well watch for a
chance of some kind then but i will not
let you risk your life we of ihelos obey the


planet stories

book even if our enemy sees fit occasionally
to violate the spirit in which it was con-
ceived

     lell me something mason said this
feud of yours whats it all about you
mentioned that book business once before
and it seems a people with your apparent
piety and maturity and general advancement
would certainly find a way to arbitrate such
a dispute what are you fighting about

   kriijorls answering smile was thin and
there was a puzzled look in his craggy
features

  we fight because the book of the
saints says we must he answered at length
and further than that-

   yes

   further than that im afraid we do not
know

   mason felt his features twisting into an
incredulous expression despite his efforts to
realize and appreciate the wide gap of cul-
tural differences between them

   dont know but you cant fight a war
without knowing why you-

   it is in the book of the saints the
ihelian said and therefore it is our com-
mand and- he looked into the earth-
mans face with the slightest hint of a
smile from what ive learned of earths
history from your own lips lieutenant
what of your own past wars who among
your own soldiery has really known why he
fought

  well but- and then mason re-
turned the smile no it isnt so different
is it but tell me more about this book
is it based on law religion ethics

   and this time there was no smile on the
ihelians broad face

   legend says all three he replied

  legend and yet you blindly obey-

   we always have its writings such as we
understand them to be have governed us
for millenia lieutenant the book is our
way our life we are told we could not be
a civilization without it

   mason was silent for a long moment he
did not want to question too deeply the
beliefs sacred to another yet it was so
damnably peculiar they fought bitterly
and they did not know why

  could you-would you let me see a
copy of this book kriijorl

    if i could id be glad to lieutenant
for i have often wished i could see the
words it contains myself

   youve never read it

    never nor has any ihelian or thrayxite
for thousands of years there is you must
understand only one book of the saints

    just one copy

   yes it has long been deemed sacrilege
for mortal eyes to view the ancient writings
the single copy is kept in a great vault
built of indestructible metals and protec-
tively sheathed to last for all time the spot
above its burial place is marked by a tall
spire of stone it is jealously protected

   you said that its commands commit you
and thrayx to eternal battle but if you
could only read it you might learn the basic
cause of your conflict-and knowing cer-
tainly-

   the thought has often occurred to me
but there is even more prohibiting such an
impossible undertaking than the powerful
bondage of tradition and belief alone
lieutenant and that is the books very
location

   and that-

    the subterranean vault in which it rests
is guarded in the forest of saarl and the
forest of saarl my friend is on thrayx

iv

tt is something completely beyond my
i- understanding the ihelian was say-
ing the two men stood each flanked by two
guards at the threshold of a great ramp
which led from the main air lock of the
thrayxite ship to the reddish surface of the
spaceport upon which it had landed but min-
utes before mason felt a chill of awed
amazement not because of the unexpected
beauty of the verdant hills that rolled in a
delicate blend of kaleidoscopic pastels on
every side of the port and as far as the eye
could see nor was it even from the sight of
the exquisite towers that rose as though from
the heart of some fabled fairyland scant
miles to the south

  theyre all-all women mason
breathed not a single man and he
looked quickly to kriijorl you mean you
did not know this

   know by the teeth of jhavuul we
the woman-stealers of thrayx



never so much as suspected lieutenant we
have not looked upon a thrayxite face for
five thousand years

   the guards spoke to-them tersely in the
common tongue of ihelos and thrayx al-
though peculiarly accented to ihelian ears
and kriijorl gestured with a slight move-
ment of his head to mason at a quick
pace they started down the ramp

  were sunk kid mason said and he
saw the heaviness in the great vikings face
well never make it out of here in a mil-
lion years even if we made a break for it
even if we had our hands free where could

-	we hide couldnt make a move two men
among an entire female populace-

   he let the sentence trail off as he realized
that kriijorl wasnt hearing him and as
their brief view of thrayx was terminated
by their entrance into a smaller shuttle-ship
he saw the hint of a smile flicker at the
corners of the ihelians lips

  their captors strapped them into ham-
mocks and when they had gone to assist
others in herding a portion of the earth-
women aboard the same craft kriijorl final-
ly spoke

  i think for the moment their probes
may be off us he said quickly i was
relieved of my own during my unconscious-
ness so were no longer screened and the
fact that we speak in yoilr tongue does us
little good but hear me if we are being
taken where  hope we are then they are
playing into our hands almost as well as
we could have asked there will be a
limited freedom there and a chance if
we are clever enough to get to a mentacom
installation a planetary unit of unlimited
range

  but among women mason asked and
his throat was dry

  that is the pint kriijorl replied
tersely we shall be among males almost
exclusively save for the earthwomen and
those thrayxites who periodically will be
sent to breed

   you mean the planetoid that you calked
of before     but i-

   think a moment thrayxite is a matri-
archy something we of ihelos never sus-
pected and therefore we erred further-
what we believed to be a labor planetoid
is not of course

   breeders

  exactly and if we can make it to one
of their mentacoms perhaps our problem
will be solved except that-m his voice
hesitated and mason saw doubt in the sud-
den frown i-i have no right to sacrifice
your life nor those of your women if we
were to get to a mentacom it would be to
contact my people to inform them of the
planetoids true nature so that we may
even the score for what was done to our
own breeders and perhaps even form a
plan to take prisoners to replace them but
such a message would be intercepted of
course

  hell we could dodge em lone
enough-

  perhaps we could lieutenant but the
ships i summon will be fighting their way
through a trebled thrayxite guard-and
once within range of our enemys breeder
satellite they will have little time to seek
us out and effect our rescue destruction
will have to be immediate now do you
understand

  mason wet his lips he understood
death for the breeders for the earth-
women and for themselves

  nuts he clipped out that means
that as far as youre going to be concerned
im just another ihelian private first class
for awhile not a space-neurotic earthman
and our girls    well i think-i think
theyd prefer anything to the living death
in store for them-the rotting away of their
lives in some infested alien jungle anyway
somebodys got to be judge so lets get
this damned thing doped out

   the ihelian began a reply but the words
were stopped in his throat by die sudden
pressure of acceleration as powerful engines
rambled suddenly to throbbing life and
lifted the thrayxite craft quickly toward
the eye of a great white sun

for the second time in her life judith
kent watched the warp configurations
of the large magellanic cloud from the
far side of the rim somehow it frightened
her as though some awful deadliness must
lie within it

   helplessly she carried out cain s orders
and as hopelessly wondered of the fate of
lance and kriijorl captives with the
	planet stories

earthwomen in the thrayxite ship with
which cain was so rapidly closing or ly-
ing dead somewhere as she more than half
believed in the chill wilds of northern
canada the odds had been so great she
knew that to hope without reason was folly
and yet not to hope was no longer to care

  she twisted away quickly from cains
muscular arm

  whats eating you duchess your con-
science giving you trouble or are you just
plain scared when she didnt reply he
laughed shortly and gestured toward the
scanner in it the slender thrayxite craft
was growing steadily larger as cains swift
pursuit gradually folded the gap of curved
space between them in a couple of min-
utes well be ready to talk turkey sweetheart
they ought to be aware of us right this
minute i think theyll listen to what we
have to offer

  to what you have to offer

  he laughed again its more than mason
ever had you know sometimes i think
you were torching for that space-happy has-
been

  she felt the burn of rising color in her
cheeks and turned quickly away from him

  you dont get it yet do you duchess
his heavy voice was saying behind her its
never occurred to you that there are other
places to be beside with your own flock
that there are other men among whom to
seek your fortune if the ones you were born
among didnt offer the opportunities you
expected what are we among the stars
at all for if its not to find our destinies
anywhere we think they might lie whats
this big freedom for if not to use to some
kind of advantage and me im sick of
being a warrant under worn out space-
neurotics like mason and i dont want to
end up being one either

  judith held her lips tight against the
thing that surged hotly inside her there
would have to be a way to stop this man
and if there werent- how the pampered
friends whom jhed left so proudly to
choose tliis calling would laugh at her
would say that was what the hot headed
little rebel deserved    she bad it coming
if she couldnt act like a lady and they
were wrong

  but tlus man was hideously twisting all

the things she had thought were good and
right worth hoping and striving for all
the priceless tilings that had stood for
more than the soft idle and pointlessly
shallow existence to which shed been born

  but i guess you wouldnt get it cain
was saying born with a silver shovel in
your mouth you dont have to worry about
sweating out your pile quit any time and
there it all is after your little adventure
still waiting for you to come home to may-
be theyll even want you to write a book
but me-my father wasnt a lucky g-pros-
pector

  a proximity alarm clanged and cain
quickly turned his attention to the control
banks he jacked out the auto control and
took over manually and- within seconds
the pursuit was hovering over the great
whale-like back of the thrayxite craft and
then was drawn slowly to it as its powerful
magnetics reached out ensnared it then
cain cut the pursuits drive and they both
waited

  the airlock opened and the two wtomen
stepped through there were weapons in
their hands

  t w-ant to see your commander cain

barked

  i am the commander of this comple-
ment the taller of the two said in an
almost unaccented english you will con-
sider yourselves my captives daleb 

  what not all women there was a
curious look on cains face thoughts were
racing behind the thin blades of his eyes

  you are prisoners of the matriarchy of
thrayx the officer called daleb said if
you do not resist you shall be unharmed

   all right come off that alien-meets-alien
stuff cain said as though the two briefly-
uniformed women before him held toys
rather than weapons in their hands i
didnt just tag after you at a billion times
the speed of light to get thrown into one
of your dungeons ive got some informa-
tion i think you can use and- tnd the
curious look was again on his face -there
are some-shall we say-services i thick
 can profitably perform for you

  profitably earthman profitable bo
whom

  to both of us to me-thats wfay fm
beie-and to you
the woman-stealers of thrayx



  judiths face was white perhaps this was
some dever trick of cains she could have
been wrong

  tell me this information you have
karthman

  lets dicker about price first goldy-
locks he stood there confident defiant
great muscles bundled beneath the fabric of
his tunic

  you earthman are hardly in bargain-
ing position only the womans mouth
moved her eyes bored straight into cains
like fine diamond drills

  chuck me cain said with a grin and
you chuck the best chance youve ever had
to take your ihelian friends to the cleaners
what information i have concerning ihelian
plans is one thing judith caught her
breath she knew cain was lying now even
lance had learned little of the ihelian
strategy above kriijorls attempt to enlist
earthwomen for ihelian breeding colonies
it was all she realized suddenly a colossal
bluff from which cain planned to play his
cards as he went along and now he had
found a wedge of some sort some new bar-
gaining point there was still that curious
look on his face that careless grin at his
lips but what service i can render you
he was continuing is quite another
ladies how good are your teleprobe gadgets
against an ihelian screen a big blank
arent they but i still think youd give
those cute shirts of yours to find out whats
going on inside the thick skulls of our
ihelian friends

  a puzzled look flickered across die
thrayxite commanders face yet she re-
mained immobile and her weapon held
steady

  first of all bright eyes cain said
swiftly may you be the first to know that
theyre all men all men get it there
was a soft gasp from daleb and the com-
manders eyes flickered widened almost
imperceptibly and better yet im a pal
of kriijorl their commander who picked
us up just inside the rim that time you
followed us into earth so think it over it
ought to be worth a fancy little pile to you
ladies since women agents would be kind
of conspicuous in an all-male civilization

  you expect us to believe this fantasy
do you expect us to accept your proposal

on the basis of nothing more than words
and the technique you describe it has never
been used never even considered as a legiti-
mate method of battle

  cain laughed easily then maybe you
better consider it if you want to come out
on top and as to the rest of it if i was
part of some counter-plot against you do
you think idve gone to the trouble of
bringing along some security and judith
felt something freeze inside her as he threw
a careless glance in her direction there
she is-sergeant judith kent your hostage
for this little operation if i misbehave she
should make a pretty good bargaining point
with ihelos from all i gather theyve got
earth sore enough at them as it is

   there was an instants silence and then
the commander said you have not proven
your statement that our enemy is a male
enemy

  what do you think they wanted women
for on earth after you blasted that planetoid
of theirs a quilting party or something
add it up

   the quiet in the small control bubble was
electric judith watched the thrayxites
faces as they weighed the incredible thing
that cain had said

   i havent got all eternity cain snapped
you think you can afford not to believe
me

  very well our book has never men-
tioned this technique of spying and there-
fore there can be no rule against it as for
the rest-that could be immaterial you
could be of value to us outline your plan
thats better girls only take it just a
little slower we both know what we are
but lets baggie for awhile about the price
shall we

v

judith shivered partly from an uncon-
trollable terror and partly from the pre-
dawn dampness creeping from the thick
jungle surrounding the small dearing which
held one of the breeder planetoids many
secluded colonies the camp and the tangled
growth which bounded it was her prison
a place in which there was freedom yet
where none were free to walk or to run
or to hide-but where and so it was with


planet stories

the rest-the hard-muscled obviously drug-
clouded males who had never known any
other world than this who never questioned
from whence came the periodic groups of
thrayxite women for them to fertilize who
only glared dully at her dimly understand-
ing that she was to be although captive
here left to herself and unmolested yet
despite her status as hostage and earth-
woman she was afraid

   the brute of a camp leader bruhlla   
 not drugged like the rest there was more
 to his sidelong glances than curiosity and
 vague resentment too often she could
 sense his eyes upon her and she wondered
 at the increasing frequency of his visits to
 the camps well guarded mentacom installa-
 tion

   she had lost count of night and days
 under the white sun of thrayx and its
 ringed host there had been two perhaps
 or three three days in which roger cain
 had been doing what was he with kriijorl
 and lance posing as their friend their fel-
 low captive listening to their plans against
 their thrayxite captors    remembering
 or would they be freed if indeed they still
 lived in order that cain could with them
 learn even more of ihelian stratagems on a
 far greater scale

   and the earth girls-she had heard the
 cries of some the desperate curses of others

   bruhlla entitled to use of the mentacom
 for daily contact reports with thrayx as he
 was was the only other alien being on the
 planetoid who could converse with her
 he had lost little time in probing her to
 learn her tongue and he had already
 hinted at the fate of the women from her
 planet in other camps on the planetoid
 held in small isolated groups unmolested
 bruhlla had said but prisoners as was she

  somehow the ihelians would have to
 know

   for there was no earth to which to turn
 now

   the shiver again shook her slender body
 and her tattered uniform did little to shield
 her from the damp cold

still one apart from the rest of us are
you the growl of bruhllas voice behind
her startled her and she turned quickly to
facc the loose grimace of derision on his
thick lips

    i am to be left to myself she said with
  what assurance she could muster that is
  your order

   hi know my order little one no need
  to tell bruhlla his orders but perhaps
  you will grow colder perhaps you will
  grow hungry

   you couldnt-

    i have no order about feeding you little
 one

   somehow she found the strength to voice
 her defiance for she could still think and
 thought lance had once told her was the
 ultimate strength   

   you lie there was such an order but
 if you wish to bring the wrath of your
 masters down upon your ugly head she
 watched his unkempt face fanned the sud-
 den puzzlement she saw growing in his red
 sadistic eyes if his intelligence were blurred
 enough by the self-made drug of his lust
 i myself heard such an order and if you
 can prove me mistaken you may do with
 me what you will god would he stop to
 realize that she understood not a word of
 the thrayxite tongue

   quickly proven my little one quickly
 enough proven and then if what you say
 is untrue he left the sentence mercifully
 unfinished and turned toward the sturdily-
 built cubicle that housed the colonys men-
 tacom

    wait ill only believe your proof if i
 can hear it for myself

    come along then and you shall hear it
 the thick lips slackened into a lascivious
 grin that sickened her but she hastened to
 follow him and he did not see her as she
 scooped the jagged stone from the ground
 thrust it into a tattered tool-pocket of her
 uniform

    past the quiescent sweat reeking bodies
 of the bull-muscled guards into the dimly
 lit chamber beyond bruhlla half walking
 half shambling before her

   she watched him as he switched the
 device into life waited until its dull orange
 glow assured that it was ready for use so
 much like the communications room of an
 ordinary ship of earth she thought so
 like the familiar things of her life yet so
 alien

 he had barely slipped the mentacoms
 headpiece on his skull and adjusted a
the woman-stealers of thrayx



simply calibrated control dial when she
struck him at the base of his thick neck
with the stone all the force of her supple
young body behind it

  blood spurted as its ragged edges tore
through flesh bone and nerves and slowly
bruhlla crumpled from the rude chair that
held his dying bulk

  thought images as well as words kri-
ijorl had explained during their flight so
long ago in the helio language would be
no barrier over the head like this    and
this switch-

  she twirled the large dial from its setting
watched a slender thread of light within a
transparent sphere above it fluctuate in
breadth as the dial twisted and when it
was at its widest she gambled that it in-
dicated the broadest transmitting beam of
which the mentacom was capable

  and then she marshalled her thoughts
carefully chose the simplest words

  warning lbelos there is an earthman
among you at work as a spy for thrayx i
am a captive

  over and over the same words the same
thought images which they formed of cain
of this hell-planetoid itself

  the orange glow pulsated as though it-
self alive with the desperation of her signal
and she heard the guard barely in time

  a howl of rage bellowed from him as
she turned twisted frantically just outside
his grasp darted headlong through the
door

  and she was quicker than those outside
she was beyond them running the breath
sobbing in her throat

  away from the blood-soaked thing shed
ieft crumpled in death behind her and to-
ward the jungles edge toward some new
horror perhaps and toward a freedom that
would be short-lived at best for she had
killed bruhlla and she knew they would not
stop now until she had been run to earth

the three men watched as the six ships
landed in the jungle clearing emptied
of the selected thrayxite women who would
in little more than a days time re-enter
diem the breeders seed within their bodies
foe the journey bade to die mother planet

  it had been the same the day before and
the day before diat and in the distance they

had watched similar craft descend toward
other of the many colonies with which the
lush planetoid was dotted

  nuts cain said he turned to mason
what the hell else is there to do sit here
and rot they wont kill us theyll just let
nature take its course-

  theres more to be done than simply
make a run for it to one of dieir ships-
mason snapped the mentacoms on them
kriijorls said a dozen times havent the
necessary range

  so whats your plan or dont i get to
hear any of the details

  mason studied the big mans face cap-
tured in his attempt to rescue the earth-
women he had said his explanation had
been that simple new-un hadnt believed
judith but she had convinced him and
so hed tried on his own responsibility and
simply hadnt made it and then theyd
brought him here scarcely hours after
mason and kriijorl had themselves beea
delivered to the teaming colony

  logical enough yes cain was the kind
who would try such a crazy stunt alone
with such supreme overconfidence in his
own muscle power yet-

  we must not be impatient kriijorl
interrupted his thought he stood up his
blond head nearly touching the top of the
plastifabric tent we must be certain and
wait for the best time mister cain for if
we fail in our first attempt there will not
be a second and it has only been three
days as yet we have been left quite to our-
selves even my life has not been threat-
ened

  mason noticed the puzzled frown that
was across the ihelians forehead do you
think-

  i cannot even guess the reason for
that kriijorl murmured as though more
to himself than in answer to masons ques-
tion by all the rules of our conflict i
should be stretched naked for the jungle
beasts by now

  forget it cain broke in quickly
youre alive now and if we can have a
little action around here maybe youll stay
that way weve watched long enough they
dont guard those ships at all these breed-
ers they keep drugged to the eyes so why
should diey i say we just grab one and


planet stories

blast off unless somebodys got a better
plan and i still havent heard one-
awfully anxious arent you mister
cain mason asked

   im not afraid of em if thats what you
mean

  lance turned to kriijorl maybe hes
right weve watched for three days what
do you think

   the ihelian looked out across the colony
of low square-shaped enclosures and to its
far side where the twisted jungle began
to the spot where the mentacom was housed
in a squat guarded dome of crudely-shaped
steel then he turned back to die earthman
and mason saw the uncertainty in his eyes

  we have gained far less than i had
hoped by watching he said slowly we
have learned the number of their guards
and the period of their changc but perhaps
that is all we shall learn if you think that
as soon as there is darkness-

  about time cain said sourly and
itll be straight for the-

  to the mentacom first mason said
quietly and after that to the ships if we
can mister cain he felt strangely calm
as his eyes met cains squarely somewhere
within him there was something changing
take it from an ex-has-been big man
thats how its going to be

the camp was dark and silent as the
three men left the tent they walked as
if from boredom changing direction often
as though at random yet they moved with
a deceiving swiftness and each step brought
them closer to the crude dome the sound
of their movements was as a whisper that
lost itself with the quiet murmur of the
night wind through the web of the jungle
and when they were close enough they
halted to wait to watch

  there was the soft clink of metal on
meial and the mutter of dead-toned voices
as the guard changed four hulking shapes
walked at last in a tired shamble from the
structure housing the mentacom four others
prepared to take their posts

   and there was little to disturb the silence
after that

   a muffled grunt a choked off curse lost
in a brief rustle of undergrowth as though
a sudden breeze had momentarily ruffled its

languid calm and that was all

  four breeders lay dead outside the dome

  mason felt the warm stickiness of blood
on his face and the sting of a deep cut some-
where upon it he saw that cain was
straightening over a mangled form that
kriijorl had overcome odds of two to one
the breeder at his own feet had died swiftly
of a deftly broken neck a reddened dirk
still clutched in his stiffening fingers

  then they were inside the dome and
kriijorl was placing the head-unit of the
mentacom over his matted yellow hair

  mason watched in the half-light of the
pulsing orange glow listened to the heavi-
ness of cains breathing

  and he saw kriijorls face stiffen sud-
denly with a swift movement the ihelian
had handed him the head-unit and with
slipper fingers he fumbled the device into
place over his own head

  before he could think he had given cain
all the warning that he had needed

  my god its judith somehow shes-

  kriijorl lunged too late the man whom
judiths mentacom message had branded as
a spy was already through the domes door
running

  mason moved more quickly than the
ihelian then ahead in the jungle there was
a crashing sound and mason tripped sud-
denly himself as he ran fell kriijorl leapt
past him in the darkness as though he could
somehow see through it and then mason
had regained his feet and was following
blindly

  and suddenly he thought of the empty
ships behind them and cains abrupt use-
iessnc-ss to his thrayxite employers then-

  but the gamble was too great cain might
not double back but instead plunge head-
long further and further into the conceal-
ing morass before him no cain would not
double back not now for in kriijorl he
had met an even match and now he was
afraid

  fully an hour had passed when his tunic
torn and the exposed flesh bleeding mason
caught up with kriijorl

  he was nearly within my hands for a
moment- the giant whispered feoarsely
he breathed with difficulty and there were
long slashes gleaming redly in the darkness
across his great muscles
the woman-stealers of thrayx



  mason stood silently for moments toy-
ing with a thought that nagged insistently
at the edge of his brain he knew cain
he knew the man

  then suddenly his thoughts were inter-
rupted by the muffled sound of a rocket
blast and within moments there was a
vertical trail of fire above them as a thrayx-
ite ship hurtled skyward

  by jhavuul-

  no mason exclaimed the blast was
from in front of us he didnt double back
must be another colony near our own and
he stumbled out of this overgrown mess
and right into it there was simply an
empty ship-

  then the traitor has won kriijorls
face was tilted upward and in the faint
glow of the planetesimal belt that girdled
thrayx it seemed more than ever that of
an heroic viking king of ages gone

  theres a chance he hasnt mason
breathed he had the thought now pinned
down clear in his head if there has been
no alarm back at our own camp we may still
have the mentacom to ourselves well
signal ihelos as you planned and then-
then there is something else you will say
something else that i think will as the
saying goes on earth kill two birds with a
single blast

  mason had lost track of time perhaps
it was as many as two hours before they had
fought their way through the clutching
undergrowth back to the mentacom at the
fringe of their own camp several times
they had had to stop for there had been
sounds in the jungle other than those they
had made themselves animals kriijorl
had said who had got the scent of their
blood but the noises had not been fast and
crashing-more those of stealth as were
those of their own steps a single animal
perhaps with the scent of their blood or
that of the breeder guard they had slain
and stalking

   the dome was still silent and the stiff
corpses outside it lay undisturbed in the
thick undergrowth in the clearing the six
empty thrayxite ships towered in the sleep-
ing quiet star-shine glinting faintly from
their polished hulls

  wordlessly they entered the dome and
it was as they had left it

  kriijorl again adjusted the headset and
the orange glow pulsed and waned as
mason watched

   and then at length if they are to know
they know now kriijorl said and the
thrayxite host as well what was there you
wished to add lieutenant

  mason spoke quickly say that you have
discovered that the priceless-and you must
say priceless-book of the saints is in the
forest of saarl on thrayx say that we have
discovered it to be less well protected than
is generally believed then give the loca-
tion of the subterranean vault as precisely
as you can

  but my people are well aware-

  i realize that but our friend cain
doesnt

   the ihelians face was still puzzled but
he projected the thought-message mason
had dictated

  and then in seconds the ihelian had
hastily but thoroughly wrecked the mcn-
tacom and the two men left its silent dome
for the empty ships that beckoned so tan-
talizingly a scant quarter-mile distant

  they had run perhaps a dozen steps
when the undergrowth behind them ripped
and tore and mason spun

  there was a muffled cry and he had
barely time to catch judiths bleeding body
as she fell in exhaustion into his arms

vi

the muscles in his arms and legs trem-
bled with fatigue as he lifted the semi-
conscious girl up to kriijorl and then
with what seemed an impossible effort
hauled himself through the deserted ships
stern airlock

  the ihelian seemed to carry judith as
though she were a feather as he climbcd
the narrow ladder above mason infinitely
upward the earthman thought  an in-
finite distance to the ships forehull to its
control banks

  there was only the sound of his own
hoarse breathing in his ears as he climbed
rang after rung and the hollow echo of
kriijorls boots as they mounted resolutely
above him

  then they had made it and were strap-
ping judith into a hammock were taking
is

planet stories

  tiieir own shock-seats before the control
  banks of the thrayxite shuttle-craft

    the ihelian did not hesitate his fingers
  deliberated for only a moment above the
  firing studs in the blue-green glow of the
  banks and then they flicked home and
  engines muttered roared into terrifying life

    within moments saying nothing moving
  the swift silent movements of desperation
  they had freed themselves of the grasping
  snaxc qf the jungle beneath them were
  once more strong liberated things in the
  vast freedom of space

    and now ihejos kriijorl cried as they
  broke swiftly from the ecliptic of the great
  spangled ring of thrayx if we can but
  escape their fleet any moment they should
  be on the scanner forming to meet the
  onslaught of ihelian squadrons-

    no  mason said and his voice was like
  s solid tiling clogging his throat no not
  ihelos-not yet his eyes burned and the
  eed welts that covered his body had begun
   o sting to pain and it was hard to think
  he saw the frown forming on kriijorls
  face

    thrayx and the forest of saarl he
 bit from between teeth clenched against the
 creeping agony in him the book of the
 saints kriijorl it is the key dont you see
 key to all this your feud

    for an instant the ihelian said nothing
  bo groped in hidden pockets of his battered
  space harness his long fingers quickly pro-
  duced a tablet thrust it into masons hand
  the earthman swallowed it and almost at
  once energy coursed as though from some
  hidden well in his body through his flag-
  ging muscles and nerves

    then kriijorl spoke i do not under-
 stand lieutenant i know only that it would
 be almost certain death intrusion near the
 vault would bring a flight of guard ships
 within minutes

    i know that mason said but perhaps
  not down upon us and we must have that
  book ive been thinking about it compar-
  ing it with similar writings in earths own
  past such books are not new such motives
  such methods your book is priceless in a
  way that even you dont know kriijorl
  im certain of it for it must contain the
  reason that you fight

    and that reason

  a reason if im right that would end
your feud once and for all a nasty bit of
logic which the people of ihelos and thrayx
were quite deliberately kept from knowing
from the beginning id make book on it
that at one time both planets were very-
hungry places-

  but if you are wrong lieutenant
mason fastened his gaze straight before
him on the diamond-studded scanner and
saw that some of the smaller diamonds
were moving in a tiny echelon

  then i guess we die young he an-
swered the ihelian want to try

  the ihelians face loosened into a wry
smile sometimes you ask rather foolish
questions lieutenant ive been bred to such
business and not given my life so much
thought before this but-

  yes judith

  and then they heard a womans voice
speaking behind them thrayxite accelera-
tion hammocks could stand improvement
it said and when we leave the forest of
saarl i think ill just lie on the deck
instead

triijorls knowledge of the spots
x location in the great forest was far
more accurate than he had given mason rea-
son to hope and with a deftness that
matched that with which he had eluded the
screens of the thrayxite fleet hurtling to
protect its breeder planetoid he brought
the ship to rest at masons direction little
more than a quarter-mile from where the
book of the saints lay entombed

  it was marked by two spires one was of
hewn stone as kriijorl had said immobile
with ancient symbols carven from its base
to its pinnacle

  and the other was smooth and of metal
its gaping airlock testimony to the haste
with which it had been landed unhidden
by the natural camouflage of the soaring
trees with which the grass-carpeted clearing
was surrounded

 who-

  muscles mason answered her the
three were crouched at the clearings edge
waiting thought hed made it some way
mustve ducked in before their fleet got into
space gambling that our signal that he
picked up wouldnt bring out a special re
the woman ste

  ception committee ready and waiting to
  meet him	

    but he has preceded us by many min-
  utes kriijorl said i do not see-

    not so many he was in flight two full
  hours before you mentacommed ihelos
  and if i know him it was straight out of
  this galaxy at full blast so he had to
  back-track all that time and distance he
  had to risk a trap down here as well as
  the thrayxite fleet which he knew would
  be rushing to protect its breeders

   you had counted on those factors
 lieutenant

    two birds with one blast like i told
 youbefore mason said ask judith here
 shell tell you how well i know him the
 girl was silent but her eyes voiced her
 thoughts more eloquently than her tongue
 might have

   some will do anything to obtain the
 priceless- kriijorl said softly

    cain any time

 you have laid a clever trap lieutenant
 if it springs sure but where are those
 guard ships you were so worried about i
 was counting on them too they should be
 all over the place by now

   and he was interrupted by the high
 pitched scream of the flat finned shapes
 that hurtled suddenly over the tree tops
 circled slid quickly downward

   flat mason yelled and as they
 stretched prone they saw cain running
 toward the ship from a great open shaft
 in the ground a round shiny thing beneath
 one arm

   a probing needle of white hot flame
 stabbed out from one of the descending
 ships and there was a scream and then
 cain fell a charred skeleton to the ground
 the shiny thing he had carried rolled lazily
 along the grass teetered on edge plopped
 silently over

  mason was poised like a runner awaiting
 the starting gun for a split second he hesi-
 tated as the guard ships touched down
 their weapons momentarily screened by the
 lush foliage at the clearings edge

  and then mason was running judith
 and kriijorl only steps behind him

  there were perhaps seconds before the
 armed women of the thrayxite guard detail
 would break from the forests edge

ilers of thrayx	

    he stumbled fell and his outstretched
 hands touched the round shiny thins and
 he could smell the reek of cains smoulder-
 ing skeleton

    kriijorl and judith hesitated

       damn it run and he felt his scream
 tear at his dry throat and then clutched
 the metal disk to him and regained his
 feet in a single whip-like motion and
 bolted after them toward the gaping air
 lock of the ship that cain had never
 reached

   there was a hissing sound and a wave
 of heat crackled behind him seared his
 flesh beneath his tattered tunic and there
 was another inches before him scorching
 smoking scars in the soft green turf and
 shouted orders filled the air scant yards
 behind him

   then somehow he was at the air lock
 and strong hands were pulling him over
 its edge and it swung to glowed red as a
 bolt of raw energy spent itself harmlessly
 against it

   now ihelos mason said as he fought
 for new breath

 ti was white all white around him

       he tried to sit up but there was the
 touch of gentle hands that stayed him low-
 ered him back upon the bed

   there were two of them-tall like
 vikings and memory returned owly
 there was a smaller one too standing
 straight and erect beside him like a proud
 queen from-te pages of earths colorful
 history

   judith and kriijorl and another and
 in his hands there was the silver disk the

    he tried again to straighten and then
 heard the voice of the one whom he did
 not know

    i am yhevvak grand liege of ihelos
 the voice said and i hold in my hands
 earthman the book of the saints i have
 read it and i have broadcast to all of
 thrayx what i have read a truce delega-
 tion has already departed from that planet
 to meet us here in space

 but- the word stuck in his throat
 and it was hard to think


planet stories

  commander kriijorl said that you sus-
pected it was the key to our great trouble
you were right

  tor it tells of a conference among the
leaders of our two worlds many millenia
ago a conference held in secret because of
the nature of its subject-the very people
of our worlds themselves secret because
of the decision concerning them and their
staggering number too staggering for
either planet any longer to feed and the
record itself was then committed to this
single microtape and itself kept in secrecy
since the day it was recorded

  at first shrouded in deliberate mysti-
cism it was at length remembered only as
the last word of the saints in the sudden
wars which so quickly followed its creation
the true cause of which was skillfully falsi-
fied to the people of the time and truly
known only to those who made the micro-
tape i hold here

  they were our greatest leaders in them
was invested the responsibility for the wel-
fare and livelihood of our two planets both
materially and spiritually

  when they lived those records say
travel in space beyond the speed of light
had not been accomplished they believed
such a feat an impossibility imposed by a
condescending nature that could be chal-
lenged too far and they therefore knew
no way of reaching beyond the planets of
ihelos and thrayx for the food and re-
sources that became so sorely depleted as
both pianets became at length stripped
nearly bare as their populations swelled
beyond saturation point

  medical science had permitted the old
to grow older granted the new-born an al-
most certain purchase on life once first
breath had been drawn yet its greatest
offering was rejected by the people there
were indignant cries at the merest sugges-
tion that they intelligently regulate their
number so that their posterity might live
in greater plenty than had they

  there was but one solution for our
desperate leaders for although warfare had
long since vanished from our civilizatibn
as it had matured it took with it natures

own unpleasant balance for her overgener-
ous fecundity

  the new balance then had to be of
mans making and so it was made

  our leaders our saints as we have come
through the years to know them were of
course adept masters at the many subtle arts
of propaganda and they used those arts
to the very limits of their skill they
deliberately fomented as their ancient record
shows the wars small at first and then
ever larger between ihelos and thrayx

  they could not have foreseen that one
day there would be conflict for existence
between the sexes logically calculating in-
tellect against intuitive wily cunning in a
battle to determine the most fit who would
then enjoy die right to survive

  nor could they have foreseen that one
day because of the very conflict they
fomented the science of controlled genetics
would at last be recognized as a necessity
of survival to both factions

  today we have our answer to the age
old problem of keeping our consumption
within the limits of our ability to produce
for it we have used it to survive but to
survive war not peace

  and that as you apparently suspected
earthman is the key

  we know now why we fought and
with the knowledge of the life forces with
which we insured our continued existence
during our years of battle we may now be-
come united worlds of peace again for we
shall use that knowledge to take more ad-
visedly of natures fruits than we took
before

  well done earthmen and with our
thanks know that we shall be always in
your debt

  then yhevvak bowed low and left just
the three of them together in the white
hospital bay of his flagship

  kriijorl was smiling and there was a
shininess in judiths eyes

  mason grinned i hope those thrayxite
babes get a wiggle on he said those
earth gals gotta get em home their
mothersll be frantic hey girl not in front
of company

loves

gistla

by james mckimmey jr

wi dont you find yourself seme
nice little american girl his father
had often repeated but george was
on venus    and he loved pale
green skin    and globular heads
and most of all george
loved gistla

egrge kenington was sixteen
and as he told himself someone
who was sixteen knew more about
love than someone who was say forty-two
like his father for instance a whole lot
more probably when you were forty-two
you got narrow-minded and nervous and
angry you said this is this and that is that
and there is nothing else when someone
thought and felt and talked that way
george thought bitterly there was not
enough room inside that person to know
what it was like loving a venusian

but george knew he knew very well
her name was gistla she was not pretty
in standards of american colonists she had
the pale greenish venusian skin and she
was too short and rather thick her face of
course was not an american face it was
the face of native venus round and
smooth with the large lidless eyes there
were no visible ears and a lack of hair
strengthened the globular look of her head

but she was a person the beauty was
inside of her did you have to point to a
girls face and say here is vhere the nose
should be here is where the ears should
be did you have to measure the width be-
fcween eyes and test the color of the skin




planet stories

did you have to check the size of the teeth
and the existence of hair was all of this
necessary to understand what was inside
someone

  george snapped a leaf from an overhang-
ing vine and threw it angrily to the ground
he was walking along a thin path that led
from the colony to the tangled hills beyond
where hues of red and yellow and purple
reflected like bold sweeps of watercolor in
a moment he would see gistla and with the
color before his eyes and the sweet perfume
of the flowers in his lungs he felt again the
familiar rise of excitement

  george had not always lived on venus
the colony was very new by  most
of the earth countries had sent colonizers to
mars but as yet in june of that year venus
had been touched by only the sparsest in-
vasion of american civilization george had
arrived-just three years ago when his father
had been appointed secretary of the coloniz-
ing unit

  and tliat was the whole trouble really
father was the secretary mother was the
secretarys wife sister was the daughter of
the secretary everybody was wrapped up
in it except george

  george loved gistla

  why dont you find yourself some nice
little american girl his father had said
say like henry parrels little daughter

  henry farrels little daughter was a sweet
sickening girl with a nasty temper and a
nasty tongue her father was governor of
the colony she told you about it all the
time

  or his father had told him why not
little whats-her-name doug brentwoods
daughter

  little whats-her-names father was the
president of the council my father is
president of the council she said over
and over as though in a settlement the size
of the colony there would be anyone who
wouldnt know her father was the presi-
dent of the council

  it was all a very tight and careful circle
chosen on earth with a great deal of
common sense

  there were the ordinary settlers of
course they had daughters some of them
were very pretty and long-limbed and
george had thought about that

  certainly there wasnt a decent looking
girl in the whole governing circle and the
sight of a girl with flashing eyes and a nice
red mouth who was shaped a little like
something besides a tree stump was indeed
an exciting sight

   but there were limitations to the settler
girls

  they had no background to speak of and
though that didnt make any difference
george assured himself they knew nothing
about art music poetry or anything really
worth while and too while georges
father had said now george were all
one here each of us is as good as another
joe finch who cares for the flowers out-
side is every bit as good a man as i am-
still george knew if he told his parents
he was going to marry joe finchs daughter
someday there would be hell to pay

  so as long as the restrictions had been
bound around him there was no reason
to go just half-way george was not an
ordinary boy he did things in extreme
he was now in love with a venusian girl
and his family was already starting to make
him pay

george turned off the path just beyond
an arch of thick purple-green vines
that always reminded him of a gate to a
garden there was a quiet simplicity to this
small clearing where he and gistla met
there was an aloneness to it and only the
sound of the flat shiny leaves sliding to-
gether and the high trilling sound of the
small venusian birds broke the peaceful
silence they had always met here nowhere
else

  now as george found himself in the
clearing he began to wonder what gistla
would say or do when he told her he was
taking her home to meet his family it had
been a sudden decision brought out of
anger and indignation

  george sat down upon the fiat hollow of
a large vine the sky was murky as usual
but the soft warm feel and smell of the
growth around him with its color and
brightness made up for a sunless sky

  as he waited he remembered what his
mother had said

  oh george youre really not serious
about bringing a venusian into our home
george loves gstla

aister	y

god mari who was eighteen said this
to most anything

   but his father eyes bright and alert had
 said no now if george wants to bring
 one of these ah venusians home with him
 thats his privilege i think it would be very
 interesting

   george knew what his father meant by
interesting

   exposing gistla to his family would result
 in deliberate sarcasm and-eye-squinting and
 barely hidden smiles there would be
 pointed remarks and direct insults and
 when it was over george knew he would
 be expected to see the error of his ways
 he would then be expected to forget about
 this odd creature and find himself a nice
 ignorant little colony girl whose father
 was a member of the governing circle

and to hell with that too george said

   what george heard gistla say he
turned quickly she was standing at the
edge of the clearing her round green eyes
looking soft and serious she wore the usual
gray cape that reached her ankles her
voice was a deep round sound and there
was hardly any accent in the words she
had learned so quickly since the colony-
had begun

   talking to myself george grinned
the old excitement was inside of him
there was a kind of exotic quality in meet-
ing gistla that never disappeared

   she crossed the clearing not too grace-
 fully and touched her fingers against his
 hand this had been the extent of their
 physical expression of love

   it is nice to see you george

   he noticed his feeling of pleasure when
 he heard her speak his name there was
 something about his own name being spoken
 by gistla that had always seemed even more
 strange than anything else

   she sat down beside him and they looked
 at each other while the leaves whispered
 around them and the birds fluttered and
 chirped he discovered again the feeling of
 rightness sitting beside gistla there was a
 solidity about her a quiet maturity that he
 seemed able to feel in himself only when
 he was with her and that too was strange
 because in american terms of age she was
 much younger than he

    sitting as they were doing silent watch-
 ing each other had been most of their
 activity you did not need to entertain
 gistla with foolish small-talk or exaggerated
 praising

   but right now he w-antcd to tell her
quickly to make sure that she wouid fed
the enthusiasm he had felt

   listen gistla lie said while she
 watched him with her soft-looking round
 eyes i want you to come with me today
 to meet my family

   his words seemed to have an odd ring
to them and george waited tensely until
he was sure that she was not shocked or
angry about what he had just said

  she sat silently for a moment and then
 she said do you diink that is right for
 me to do george

   sure it is why not they know about
 you and me they know were in love
 love- jshe spoke the word as though
 it were an indefinite elusive thing that you
 could not offer as reason for doing any-
 thing

   gistla was very wise george realized
 but this was a time for endiusiasm a rime
 to strengthen their own relationship in this
 world

    say you will george said

   do you want me to

 well sure i do what did you think
 she held her hands in her lap quietly
 they were not unlike his own george
 observed except for the extreme smallness
 and the color

   i do not diink it will be nice for rm
 or diem she said

    ah listen gistla dont talk that way
 liil be fine but he knew that he was
 not deceiving her with die lightness he tried
 to put into his voice

   then although she had never done it
before she reached out and touched his
check george had grow-n used to the emo-
tions that reflected on her face and he knew
she was suddenly very sad yes george
she said i will go with you to meet your
famjly and she said it as though she were
telling him good-by

it was no better than he had expected

 it was worse much worse and he was
 growing angrier by die moment they were

 all seated in the rock-walled patio behind
 the large white house gistla sat beside him
 looking very small and frightened and very
 different and it was that obvious difference
 that george had hoped everyone might
 ignore but instead each of them his father
 his mother his sister appeared to be trying
 to make it even more obvious

  the first strain when everyone had sat
there staring at gistla as though she were
something behind a cage had passed but
now his parents and sister were moving in
a new direction they had relaxed having
found control of the situation and they
were cutting her to pieces

   tell me his sister was saying her eyes
dancing slyly dont you people have some
very strange tricks you can do

george tightened his fingers against his
palms he heard gistla answer  tricks
yes his sisters white smile shined
you know like making things disappear
things like that

   myfather gistla said seriously can
do very wonderful things he is a musi-
cian

  georges father leaned forward blinking
amusedly really what does he play
play asked gistla

  yes hes a musician he must play
something some kind of instrument

  gistla looked at george but george did
not know what to say he wished he had
never tried to do this he wished he had
just ignored his family and gone on loving
gistla in the privacy of his own emotions

  well now mr kenington was saying
rather impatiently does he play something
like our violin or clarinet or oboe or what
his father george had noticed was becom-
ing impatient more frequently since he had
become secretary the secretarial post was
very important

   he does not play anything gistla said
carefully he just    makes the music
and i hear it

  but how mr kenington insisted
 what does he play the music on he cer-
tainly cant make the music without using
something to make it on

  gistla glanced again at george and he
said quickly ils pretty hard to understand
father i dont think-

  no now dont interrupt just now soo

this is very interesting wed like to know
what shes talking about

  mrs kenington spoke for the first time
are you just making this up

  it was like a whip coming through the
air his mother sat there blinking the sus-
picion and distrust she felt-for this creature
showing in her eyes and upon her mouth
andeven in the way she was sitting

  now lois mr kenington said as
though he really sympathized with what
she had said believing that not only gistla
was making it up but that all of her race
made everything up but he was stubborn
come now tell us tell us what you
mean

   gistlas smooth head turned this way and
that sometimes she said slowly my
father journeys to other places and if he
cannot return soon he sends me music
when the light has gone from the day and
i am alone i hear it

  you mean he sends it by wires or by
radio mr kenington asked with surprise

  no

  now wait a minute georges sister
leaned forward smiling you just hear
this music is that right up here she
tapped her forehead

   yes said gistla

  my god georges sister said she
looked at her parents arching her eyebrows

  you shouldnt make things up
georges mother said

   mother george said his face coloring
shes not making things up

  just a moment son mr kenington
said crisply you dont want to talk to
your mother in that tone

  no but my god georges sister went
on imagine no wires no loudspeakers
just  up here she tapped her forehead
again

  im not talking to my mother in any
tone at all george said disregarding his
sister

  well she shouldnt lie said mrs
kenington with conviction

  george stood up she is not lying
mother

  i forbid you to argue with your mother
that way george said mr kenington

  i mean my god said georges sister
happily this is an innovation can you
george loves gistla



imagine gistla or whatever your name is
could your father make his music sometime
when we have a dance

gistlas eyes were hurt and she was
george knew confused she shook her head

mrs kenington was blinking accusingly
do they teach you to make these things
up is that what they teach you at home
mother will you please george said
why must you talk to her that way

  mr kenington stood up quickly i did
not raise my son to show an attitude like
that to his mother

  but she isnt making this up george
said you asked her to tell you and she-
georges sister had jumped out of her
chair and she was waltzing over the patio
she began humming as she danced cant
you just see it everyone dancing around
listening to music in their heads no or-
chestra or records or anything

  mr kenington stood very tall are you
taking the word of your mother or this   
this  he motioned curtly at gistla

  george licked his lips looking defensive-
ly at each one of his family it isnt a
matter of taking anyones word at all its
just something we dont understand
georges sister whirled and then suddenly
she stopped putting her hand against her
mouth my god what if everyone got the
music different i mean does everyone hear
the same music dear because if they didnt
what a mess she began dancing again her
skirt swirling over the bricks of the patio

  mr keningtons voice was louder i
think we understand all right george
there isnt anything about this we dont
understand

  georges lips were paling

  his sister dipped and turned we could
call it a music in the head dance every-
body brings his own head she laughed
merrily my god

  george noticed then that gistla was dis-
appearing out of the rear gate he stood
clenching his fists and glaring at his family
his sister had stopped dancing but she
was still laughing

  i didnt think george his mother
said resolutely that you were going to
invite someone who lied

  george turned and ran after gistla

a-planet-january

they sat again in the clearing george
could still feel the anger churning in-
side him and he held his hands together
so tightly that his fingers began to ache
i hate them for that he said

  gistla touched his arm no george it
is all right it is the way things are

  but they dont need to be my family
did that on purpose

  they just dont understand my race is
very different from yours and it seems
strange

  so does mine george said standing
and beginning to pace back and forth

  it had been what he really had expected
but still he had hoped somehow that his
family might have understood he looked
at gistla sitting quietly her large eyes
watching him he knew he loved her very
much just then more in fact than he ever
had before because she had been refused
by his family

  listen gistla he said kneeling on the
grass in front of her it wont make any
difference what anyone thinks or does or
says i love you and ill go on loving you
well build our own life the way we want
it

  she shook her head slowly no george
it does make a difference you cannot forget
your family or your people that is impor-
tant to you i would only hurt you

  do you love me

  yes

  then thats all thats important to me
not what anyone thinks not what my
sister thinks or my father r my mother
we are different you and i she sat
unmoving her smooth face unchanging
my people seem strange t yours because
we can do things your people do not under-
stand we seem strange because we look
differently we act differently we value
things differently

  my values are the same as yours
george pleaded i love you because of
what you are not because of some kind of
stupid chart for physical beauty not be-
cause   

george she said look at me
george met her eyes suddenly caught by
the urgency in her voice and slowly in
front of his eyes she changed her features
shifted until george saw a beautiful young


planet stories

 girl with pink white skin and red lips he
 saw shining blue eyes and shimmering
 golden hair that fell over her shoulders
 gistlas body had changed to a lithe smooth
 figure that revealed its contours beneath the
 gray cape

   he caught his breath and wiped a hand
 at his eyes

    what you see said gistla softly is
 an illusion you see what would be in your
 values a beautiful girl

   george opened his mouth but was un-
 able to find his voice

   do not be afraid george beneath the
 illusion of your senses i am still gistla i
 am still a venusian

    george reached out and touched his fin-
 gers against a white arm and a white shoul-
 der bared by the cape he touched the
 golden hair gistla he said amazed

   youre beautiful

    yes she said sadly

 but-you really are your hair and your
 eyes and your mouth how did you do it
 she shook her head to show its unimpor-
 tance it is something-like your hypno-
 tism

   george raised himself from his knees
 and sat beside her but i cant believe it
 you can see you can feel

   yes george said yes

    you are happy with me this way arent
 you george

    but youre so beautiful

    the golden-haired girl nodded her head
 and the shining blue eyes watched him
 carefully

   you see then gistla said it does
 make a difference you love me more this
 way

   no george said touching her hair
 again i dont love you more but if you
 can do this why then well have no more
 worries dont you see

    i think so gistla said looking away
 georges voice was excited and his eyes
 darted over her face and body would
 other people see you as i do

    if i wished yes

 then you see its all changed you are
 what i see golden-haired and pale-
 kinned-

   i am still gistla you would always
 know that would you love something thai

  is not real just becausc you see it with your
  eyes

<<TI>ut i can feel that youre real

   -- george said putting his hands on
 her shoulders he pulled her closer and
 kissed her hair youre gistla he said
 and youre beautiful he tipped her face
 up to his and bent to kiss her mouth

   his lips touched smooth green skin and
 he looked into gistlas large round lidless
 eyes he recoiled as though he had been
 touched by fire

   she watched him as he wiped a trembling
 hand across his chest and her globular head
 glistened in the reflection of the late sun

   she nodded when you see what i really
 am the difference h important she gath-
 ered her cloak around her and stood up

   george felt the flush of his face and he
 could not meet her eyes he heard her walk
 a few steps away

   good-by george she said

  he jumped up quickly that wasnt
fair

   no she said slowly but it proved
 the value of things

   it wasnt fair george repeated and
 it didnt prove anything

   i think it did she said moving away

   mno listen gistla he said you cant
 judge anything by what i did or said we
 are different in a physical sense but that
 doesnt really matter if a golden-haired girl
 materializes in front of my eyes you cant
 blame me for what my emotions did its
 still you i love not the color of your skin
 or the shape of your mouth but you and
 what you or i or anybody else looks like
 isnt important

   he followed her and caught her arm
she turned to face him you can say that
she said your words tell me that and
your eyes but i know it isnt true

   the embarrassment was still inside him
 but the way she denied him made him want
 her more than ever he held to her arm
 and then he said gistla could you change
 me i mean so that other people even i
 would see me as they see you-as a venus-
 ian

   she stood very still staring at him

   could you he asked

   yes
george loves gistla



   then do it gistla ill prove to you that
nothing is important but you and me ill
be a venusian like you are ill go back
to my family as a venusian and ill take
you with me ill prove that neither they
nor anybody else makes any difference in
how i love you

   gistla watched him solemnly finally she
said would you really do that

  yes he said quickly yes

  i love you george she said in her
deep round voice

   he lifted his hands to touch her face and
he found that his skin had turned to pale
green he touched his own face and he
knew that if he looked into a mirror he
would see a round smooth head with large
lidless eyes

  is that what you wanted she asked
yes he said stubbornly thats what
i wanted he stood there for a long time
trying to become used to it fighting the
fear that ran through him every time he
looked at his hands or touched his head
finally he said quietly lets go meet my
family

as they drew near the house he knew
his family was still in the patio he
could hear the voices of his mother and
father and the high piercing laughter of
his sister

and my god he heard his sister say
did you see the way those horrible eyes
looked at you what ever gets into george
dear dear dear he heard his mother
say

  gistla was looking at him you do not
have to do this

  yes he said feeling his heart jump
i do

   he took ler hand and they walked to the
gate of the patio he stood there feeling
gistlas hand tighten about his own and
as he said hello everybody he felt his
breath shorten as though he had suddenly
gotten stagcfright

  he saw his father turn around whats
this mr kenington said frowning
hello father george said

  father  mr kenington repeated
what are you doing in this patio

   i brought gistla back

   so i see said mr kenington his eyes

land tightened again try to
george said gistla-
going on his sister interrupted
r whatever her name is mr

narrow as he looked at gistla wheres

  mrs ke kington leaned over in her chair
peering  ell them not to come into the
patio harr she said to her husband

  listen father george said feeling
the panic begin gistla changed my appear-
ance so that i seem to look like a venusian
i came here to tell you that it doesnt make
any difference what i look like whether
i look like a venusian or a leaf on a vine
or anything else i still love her and it
doesnt make any difference he heard his
voice rising and becoming louder

  my god said his sister giggling
more black magic can you make music
she asked george

  harry his mother said they frighten
me cant you make them keep off the
patio

  mother- george began

  now see here mr kenington growled
you know we dont allow venusians
around here id advise you to get out of
here quick

  why does he keep calling you father
and mother his sister asked isnt that
queer how he keeps doing that make some
music she said to george

   george could see the hatred in his fathers
eyes and in his mothers and behind his
sisters sarcastic smile he could see the
hatred there too he felt himself getting
more tense and the panic raced through
him

  listen he shouted im george dont
you understand george

  i dont want to tell you again his
father said his face very red i dont know


planet stories

what your little game is but it isnt coming
off and so ill tell you just this one time
you get the hell off this property or
ill 

  listen george yelled im george
dont you understand

   his fathers lips thinned to a white line
and he began shouting for joe finch the
gardener

  george knew what he should have done
then he should have taken gistla and gone
he should have walked with her hand in
hand down the road and away from there
but instead the panic made his heart pound
and he saw the hatred all around him he
couldnt help it when he shouted to her
gislla for gods sake change me back
right now gistla

  he stood there breathing hard his
muscles knotted like steel while she stared
t him looking into his eyes

  suddenly he heard his father gasp and
say george

  he looked at his hands and they were
white and he felt of his face and it was his
own he saw his sisters hand against her
mouth and his father stared at him with
unbelieving eyes his mother had gotten up
and was coming over to him her eyes
blinking george she said what did
they do to you she patted his shoulder
her hands fluttering like bird wings

  he turned back to gistla and she was
gone beyond the gate now he knew
and walking slowly alone down the road
only this time he would not go after her
he couldnt and as he stood there feeling
his mothers hand patting his shoulder
hearing his sister say my god seeing
his father shake his head slowly he felt
very young and at the same time very old
and he wanted to cry
he was the last man

  the reds hit again a grenade fell into a
gully full of wounded private cafferata
hurled il back sa ing the men but suffering

by philip k dick

stark terror ruled the inner-flight ship on that last mars-
terra run for the black-clad loiters were on the prowl
   and the grim red planet was not far behind

 attention inner-flight ship at-
tention you are ordered to land
at the control station on deimos
foe inspection attention you are to land
x oncel 

   the metallic rasp of the speaker echoed
through the corridors of the great ship
the passengers glanced at each other un-
easily murmuring and peering out the port
windows at the small speck below the dot
of rock that was the martian checkpoint
deimos

    whats up an anxious passenger
asked one of the pilots hurrying through
the ship to check the escape lock

   we have to land keep seated the
pilot went on

    land but why they all looked at
each other hovering above the bulging
inner-flight ship were three slender mar-
tian pursuit craft poised and alert for any
emergency as the inner-flight ship pre-
pared to land the pursuit ships dropped
lower carefully maintaining themselves a
short distance away

   theres something going on a woman
passenger said nervously lord i thought
we were finally through with those mar-
tians now what

    i dont blame them for giving us one
fast going over a heavy set business man
aid to his companion after all were
the last ship leaving mars for terra were
damn lucky they let us go at all

   you think there really will be war
a young man said to the girl sitting in the
seat next to him those martians wont
dare fight not with our weapons and ability
to produce we could take care of mars in

	month its all talk

   the girl glanced at him dont be so
sure mars is desperate theyll fight tooth

and nail ive been on mars jhree years
she shuddered thank goodness im get-
ting away if-

   prepare to land the pilots voice
came the ship began to settle slowly drop-
ping down toward the tiny emergency field
on the seldom visited moon down down
the ship dropped there was a grinding
sound a sickening jolt then silence

   weve landed the heavy set business
man said they better not do anything to
us terra vill rip them apart if they violate
one space article

   please keep your seats the pilots voice
came no one is to leave the ship accord-
ing to the martian authorities we are to
remain here

    a restless stir filled the ship some of the
passengers began to read uneasily others
stared out at the deserted field nervous and
on edge watching the three martian pursuit
ships land and disgorge groups of armed
men

   the martian soldiers were crossing
the field quickly moving toward them
running double time

   this inner-flight spaceship was the last
passenger vessel to leave mars for terra
all other ships had long since left return-
ing to safety before the outbreak of hostil-
ities the passengers were the very last to
go the final group of terrans to leave the
grim red planet business men expatriates
tourists any and all terrans who had not
already gone home

   what do you suppose they want the
young man said to the girl its hard to
figure martians out isnt it first they give
the ship clearance let us take off and now
they radio us to set down again by die
way my names thacher bob thachec
since were going to be here awhile-



planet stories

the port lock opened talking ceased
abruptly as everyone turned a black-
clad martian official a province leiter
stod framed against the bleak sunlight
staring around the ship behind him a
handful of martian soldiers stood waiting
their guns ready

   this will not take long the leiter said
stepping into the ship the soldiers follow-
ing him you will be allowed to continue
your trip shortly

  an audible sigh of relief went through
the passengers

   look at him the girl whispered to
thacher how i hate those black uni-
forms

  hes just a provincial leiter thacher
said dont worry

  the leiter stood for a moment his hands
on his hips looking around at them with-
out expression i have ordered your ship
grounded so that an inspection can be made
of all persons aboard he said you ter-
rans are the last to leave our planet most
of you are ordinary and harmless- i am
not interested in you i am interested in
finding three saboteurs three terrans two
men and a woman who have committed
an incredible act of destruction and violence
they are said to have fled to this ship

  murmurs of surprise and indignation
broke out on all sides the leiter motioned
the soldiers to follow him up the aisle

   two hours ago a martian city was des-
troyed nothing remains only a depression
in the sand where the city was the city
and all its people have completely vanished
an entire city destroyed in a second mars
will never rest until the saboteurs are cap-
tured and we know they are aboard this
ship

  its impossible the heavy set business
man said there arent any saboteurs here
well begin with you the leiter said
to him stepping up beside the mans seat
one of the soldiers passed the leiter a
square metal box this will soon tell us
if youre speaking the truth stand up get
on your feet

  the man rose slowly flushing see
here-

  are you involved in the destruction of
the city answer

  the man swallowed angrily  know

  nothing about any destruction of any city
and furthermore-

   he is telling the truth the metal box
said tonelessly

  next person the leiter moved down
the aisle

  a thin bald headed man stood up nerv-
ously no sir he said i dont know a
thing about it

  he is telling the truth the box
affirmed

  next person stand up

  one person after another stood an-
swered and sat down again in relief at
last there were only a few people left who
had not been questioned the leiter paused
studying them intently

   only five left the three must be among
you we have narrowed it down his hand
moved to his belt something flashed a
rod of pale are he raised the rod point-
ing it steadily at the five people all right
the first one of you what do you know
about this destruction are you involved
with the destruction of our city

  no not at all the man murmured
yes hes telling the truth the box
intoned

  next

  nothing- i know nothing i had noth-
ing to do with it

   true the box said

  the ship was silent three people re-
mained a middle-aged man and his wife
and their son a boy of about twelve they
stood in the corner staring white-faced at
the leiter at the rod in his dark fingers

  it must be you the leiter grated
moving toward them the martian soldiers
raised their guns it must be you you
there the boy what do you know about
the destruction of our city answer

  the boy shook his head nothing he
whispered

  the box was silent for a moment he is
telling the truth it said reluctantly
next

  nothing the woman muttered noth-
ing

  the truth

  next

  i had nothing to do with blowing up
your city the man said youre wasting
your time
the crystal crypt



  it is the truth the box said

  for a long time the leiter stood toying
with his rod at last he pushed it back in his
belt and signalled the soldiers toward the
exit lock

  you may proceed on your trip he
said he walked after the soldiers at the
hatch he stopped looking back at the pas-
sengers his face grim you may go-but
mars will not allow her enemies to escape
the three saboteurs will be caught i prom-
ise you he rubbed his dark jaw thought-
fully it is strange i was certain they were
on this ship

  again he looked coldly around at the
terrans

  perhaps i was wrong all right pro-
ceed but remember the three will be
caught even if it takes endless years mars
will catch them and punish them i
swear it

foll a long time no one spoke the ship
lumbered through space again its jets
firing evenly calmly moving the passengers
toward their own planet toward home be-
hind them demos and the red ball that
was mars dropped farther and farther away
each moment disappearing and fading into
the distance

  a sigh of relief passed through the pas-
sengers what a lot of hot air that was
one grumbled

  barbarians a woman said

  a few of them stood up moving out into
the aisle toward the lounge and the cock-
tail bar beside thacher the girl got to her
feet pulling her jacket around her
shoulders

  pardon me she said stepping past
him

  going to the bar thacher said mind
if i come along

  i suppose not

  jhey followed the others into the lounge
walking together up the aisle you know
thacher said i dont even know your
name yet

  my name is mara gordon

  mara thats a nice name what part
of terra are you from north america
new york

  ive been in new york mara said
new york is very lovely she was slender

  and pretty with a cloud of dark hair tum-
bling down her neck against her leather
jacket

  they entered the lounge and stood un-
decided

  lets sit at a table mara said looking
around at the people at the bar mostly men
perhaps that table over there

  but someones there already thacher
said the heavy set business man had sat
down at the table and deposited his sample
case on the floor do we want to sit with
him

  oh its all right mara said crossing
to the table may we sit here she said to
the man

  the man looked up half-rising its a
pleasure he murmured he studied
thacher intently however a friend of
mine will be joining me in a moment

  im sure theres room enough for us
all mara said she seated herself and
thacher helped her with her chair he sat
down too glancing up suddenly at mara
and the business man they were looking at
each other almost as if something had passed
between them the man was middle-aged
with a florid face and tired grey eyes his
hands were mottled with the veins showing
thickly at the moment he was tapping
nervously

  my names thacher thacher said to
him holding out his hand bob thacher
since were going to be together for awhile
we might as well get to know each other

  the man studied him slowly his hand
came out why not my names erickson
ralf erickson

  erickson thacher smiled you look
like a commercial man to me he nodded
toward the sample case on the floor am i
right

  the man named erickson started to an-
swer but at that moment there was a stir
a thin man of about thirty had come up to
the table his eyes bright staring down at
them warmly well were on our way
he said to erickson

  hello mara he pulled out a chair and
sat down quickly folding his hands on the
table before him he noticed thacher and
drew back a little pardon me he mur-
mured

  bob thacher is my name thacher said


planet stories

t hope im not intruding here he
glanced around at the three of them mara
alert watching him intently heavy-set
erickson his face blank and this person
say do you three know each other he
asked suddenly

   there was silence

   the robot attendant slid over soundlessly
 poised to take their orders erickson roused
 himself lets see he murmured what
 will we have mara

   whiskey and water

   you jan

   the bright slim man smiled the same
   thacher

   gin and tonic

   whiskey and water for me also erick-
 son said the robot attendant went off it
 returned at once with the drinks setting on
 the table each took his own well
 erickson said holding his glass up to
 our mutual success

all drank thacher and the three of
them heavy set erickson mara her
eyes nervous and alert jan who had just
come again a look passed between mara
and erickson a look so swift that he would
not have caught it had he not been looking
directly at her

   what line do you represent mr erick-
 son thacher asked

   erickson glanced at him then down at
the sample case on the floor he grunted
well as you can see im a salesman
thacher smiled i knew it you get so
you can always spot a salesman right off by
his sample case a salesman always has to
carry something to show what are you in
sir

   erickson paused he licked his thick lips
 his eyes blank and lidded like a toads
 at last he rubbed his mouth with his hand
 and reached down lifting up the sample
 casf he it on tlie take in front of him

   well he said perhaps we might even
 show mr thacher

   they all stared down at the sample case

 it seemed to be an ordinary leather case
 with a metal handle and a snap lock im
 getting curious thacher said whats in
 there youre all so tense diamonds
 stolen jewels

 jan laughed harshly mirthlessly rick

put it down were not far enough away

yet

   nonsense erick rumbled were
away jan

   please mara whispered wait erick
 wait why what for youre so ac-
 customed to-

   erick  mara said she nodded toward
 thacher we dont know him erick
 please

   hes a terran isnt he erickson said
 all terrans are together in these times
 he fumbled suddenly at the catch lock on
 die case yes mr thacher im a salesman
 were all salesmen the three of us

    then you do know each other

   yes erickson nodded his two com-
panions sal rigidly staring down yes we
do here ill show you our line

   he opened the case from it he took a
letier-knife a pencil sharpener a glass globe
paper weight a box of thumb tacks a
stapler some clips a plastic ashtray and
some things thacher could not identify
he placed the objects in a row in front of
him on the table top then he closed the
sample case

   i gather youre in office supplies
thacher said he touched the letter knife
with his finger nice quality steel looks
like swedish steel to me

   erickson nodded looking into thachers
 face not really an impressive business
 is it office supplies ashtrays paper dips
 he smiled

i oh- thacher shrugged why not
theyre a necessity in modern business the
only thing i wonder-

   whats that

   well i wonder how youd ever find
enough customers on murs to make it worth
your while  he paused examining the
glass paper weight he lifted it up holding
it to the light staring at the scene within
until erickson took it out of his hand and
put it back in the sample case and an-
other tiling if you three know each other
why did you sit apart when you got on
they looked at him quickly

   and why didnt you speak to each other
 until we left deimos he leaned toward
 erickson smiling at him two men and a
 woman three of you sitting apart in the
 ship not speaking not until the check
the crystal crypt

 station was past i find myself thinking over
 what the martian said three saboteurs a
 woman and two men

  erickson put the things back in the
sample case he was smiling but his face
had gone chalk white mara stared down
playing with a drop of water on the edge
of her glass jan clenched his hands to-
gether nervously blinking rapidly

   you three are the ones the leiter was
after thacher said softly you are the
destroyers the saboteurs but their lie de-
tector- why didnt it trap you how did
you get by that and now youre safe out-
side the check-station he grinned staring
around at them ill be damned and i
really thought you were a salesman erick-
son you really fooled me

  erickson relaxed a little well mr
thacher its in a good cause im sure you
have no love for mars either no ter ran
does and i see youre leaving with the rest
of us

  true thacher said you must cer-
tainly have an interesting account to give
the three of you he looked around the
table

   we still have an hour or so of travel
sometimes it gets dull this mars-terra run
nothing to see nothing to do but sit and
drink in the lounge he raised his eyes
slowly any chance youd like to spin a
story to keep us awake

  jan and mara looked at erickson go
on jan said he knows who we are tell
him the rest of the story

   you might as well mara said

   jan let out a sigh suddenly a sigh of
relief lets put the cards on the table get
tliis weight off us im tired of sneaking
around slipping-

   sure erickson said expansively why
not he settled back in his cair unbutton-
ing his vest certainly mr thacher ill
be glad bo spin you a story and im sure
it will be interesting enough to keep you
awake

they laa through the groves of dead
trees leaping across the sun-baked
martian soil running silently together they
went up a little rise across a narrow ridge
suddenly erick stopped throwing himself
down flat on the ground the others did

the same pressing themselves against the
soil gasping for breath

   be silent erick muttered he raised
himself a little no noise therell be
leiters nearby from now on we dont dare
take any chances

  between the three people lying in the
grove of dead trees and the city was a
barren level waste of desert over a mile of
blasted sand no trees or bushes marred
the smooth parched surface only an occa-
sional wind a dry wind eddying and twist-
ing blew the sand up into little rills a
faint odor came to them a bitter smell of
heat and sand carried by the wind

  erick pointed look the city- there
it is

   they stared still breathing deeply from
their race through the trees the city was
close closer than they had ever seen it
before never had they gotten so close to it
in times past terrans were never allowed
near the great martian cities the centers of
martian life even in ordinary times when
there was no threat of approaching war the
martians shrewdly kept all terrans away
from their citadels partly from fear partly
from a deep innate sense of hostility toward
the white-skinned visitors whose commer-
cial ventures had earned them the respect
and the dislike of the whole system

   how does it look to you erick said

  the city was huge much larger than
they had imagined from the drawings and
models they had studied so carefully back
in new york in the war ministry office
huge it was huge and stark black towers
rising up against the sky incredibly thin
columns of ancient metal columns that had
stood wind and sun for centuries around
the city was a wall of stone red stone
immense bricks that had been lugged there
and fitted into place by slaves of the early
martian dynasties under the whiplash of
the first great kings of mars

   an ancient sun-baked city a city set in
the middle of a wasted plain beyond groves
of dead trees a city seldom seen by terrans
-but a city studied on maps and charts in
every war office on terra a city that con-
tained for all its ancient stone and archaic
towers the ruling group of all mars the
council of senior leiters black-clad men
who governed and ruled with an iron hand
planet stories

   the senior leiters twelve fanatic and
devoted men black priests but priests with
flashing rods of fire lie detectors rocket
ships intra-space cannon many more things
the terran senate could only conjecture
about the senior leiters and their subor-
dinate province leiters-erick and the two
behind him suppressed a shudder

  weve got to be careful erick said
again well be passing among them soon
if they guess who we are or what were
here for-

  he snapped open the case lie carried
glancing inside for a second then he closed
it again grasping the handle firmly lets
go he said he stood up slowly you two
come up beside me i want to make sure
you look the way you should

mara and jan stepped quickly ahead
erick studied them critically as the
three of them walked slowly down the
slope onto the plain toward the towering
black spires of the city

  jan erick said take hold of her
hand remember youre going to marry
her shes your bride and martian peasants
think a lot of their brides

   jan was dressed in the short trousers and
oat of the martian farmer a knotted rope
tied around his waist a hat on his head to
keep off the sun his skin was dark colored
by dye until it was almost bronze

   you look fine erick said to him he
glanced at mara her black hair was tied
in a knot looped through a hollowed-out
yuke bone her face was dark too dark
and lined with colored ceremonial pigment
green and orange stripes across her cheeks
earrings were strung through her ears on
her feet were tiny slippers of perruh hide
laced around her ankles and she wore long
translucent martian trousers with a bright
sash tied around her waist between her
small breasts a chain of stone beads rested
good-iuck charms for the coming marriage

   all right erick said he himself wore
the flowing grey robe of a martian priest
dirty robes that were supposed to remain on
him all his life to be buried around him
when he died i think well get past the
guards there should be heavy morning
traffic on the road

   they walked on the hard sand crunching

under their feet against the horizon they
could see specks moving other persons
going toward the city farmers and peasants
and merchants bring their crops and goods
to market

   see the cart mara exclaimed

  they were nearing a narrow road two
ruts worn into the sand a martian hufa
was pulling the cart its great sides wet with
perspiration its tongue hanging out the
cart was piled high with bales of cloth
rough country cloth hand dipped a bent
farmer urged the hufa on

   and there she pointed smiling

   a group of merchants riding small ani-
mals were moving along behind the cart
marxians in long robes their faces hidden
by sand masks on each animal was a pack
carefully tied on with rope and beyond the
merchants plodding dully along were
peasants and farmers in an endless proces-
sion some riding carts or animals but
mostly on foot

   mara and jan and erick joined the line
of people melting in behind the merchants
no one noticed them no one looked up or
gave any sign the march continued as be-
fore neither jan nor mara said anything to
each other they walked a little behind
erick who paced with a certain dignity a
certain bearing becoming his position

  once he slowed down pointing up at
the sky look he murmured in the mar-
tian hill dialect see that

   two black dots circled lazily martian
patrol craft the military on the outlook for
any sign of unusual activity war was
almost ready to break out with terra any
day almost any moment

  well be just in time erick said
tomorrow will be too late the last ship
will have left mars

  i hope nothing stops us mara said
i want to get back home when were
through

half an hour passed they neared the
city the wall grewing as they walked
rising higher and higher until it seemed to
blot out the sky itself a vast wall a wall
of eternal stone that had felt the wind and
sun for centuries a group of martian
soldiers were standing at the entrance the
single passage-gate hewn into the rock
the crystal crypt



leading to the city as each person went
through the soldiers examined him poking
his garments looking into his load

  erick tensed the line had slowed almost
to a halt itll be our turn soon he mur-
mured be prepared

  lets hope no leiters come around
jan said the soldiers arent so bad

  mara was staring up at the wall and the
towers beyondunder their feet the ground
trembled vibrating and shaking she could
see tongues of flame rising from the towers
from the deep underground factories and
forges of the city the air was thick and
dense with particles of soot mara rubbed
her mouth coughing

   here they come erick said softly

  the merchants had been examined and
allowed to pass through the dark gate the
entrance through the wall into the city
they and their silent animals had already
disappeared inside the leader of the group
of soldiers was beckoning impatiently to
erick waving him on

  come along he said hurry up there
old man

  erick advanced slowly his arms wrapped
around his body looking down at the
ground

  who are you and whats your business
here the soldier demanded his hands on
his hips his gun hanging idly at his waist
most of the soldiers were lounging lazily
leaning against the wall some even squat-
ting in the shade flies crawled on the face
of one who had fallen asleep his gun on
the ground beside him

  my business erick murmured i am
a village priest

  why do you want to enter the city

  i must bring these two people before
the magistrate to marry them he indicated
mara and jan standing a little behind him
that is the law the leiters have made
the soldier laughed he circled around
erick what do you have in that bag you
carry

  laundry we stay the night

  what village are you from

  kranos

  kranos the soldier looked to a com-
panion ever heard of kranos

  a backward pig sty i saw it
boating trip

once on ft

  the leader of the soldiers nodded to jan
and mara the two of them advanced their
hands clasped standing close together one
of the soldiers put his hand on maras bare
shoulder turning her around

   nice little wife youre getting he said
good and firm looking he winked
grinning lewdly

  jan glanced at him in sullen resentment
the soldiers guffawed all right the
leader said to erick you people can pass

  erick took a small purse from his robes
and gave the soldier a coin then the three
of them went into the dark tunnel that was
the entrance passing through the wall of
stone into the city beyond

  they were within the city

  now erick whispered hurry
around them the city roared and cracked
the sound of a thousand vents and machines
shaking the stones under their feet erick
led mara and jan into a corner by a row
of brick warehouses people were every-
where hurrying back and forth shouting
above the din merchants peddlers soldiers
street women erick bent down and opened
the case he carried from the case he quickly
took three small coils of fine metal intricate
meshed wires and vanes worked together
into a small cone jan took one and mara
took one erick put the remaining cone into
his robe and snapped the case shut again
now remember the coils must be buried
in such a way that the line runs through the
center of the city we must trisect the main
section where the largest concentration of
buildings is remember the maps watch
the alleys and streets carefully talk to no
one if you can help it each of you has
enough martian money to buy your way out
of trouble watch especially for cut-purses
and for heavens sake don t get lost

erick broke off two black-clad leiters
were coming along the inside of the
wall strolling together with their hands
behind their backs they noticed the three
who stood in the corner by the warehouses
and stopped

  go erick muttered and be back here
at sundown he smiled grimly or never
come back

  each went off a different way walking
quickly without looking back the leiters

watched them go the little bride was
quite lovely one ieiter said those hill
people have the stamp of nobility in their
blood from the old times

   a very lucky young peasant to possess
her the other said they went on erick
looked after them still smiling a little then
he joined the surging mass of people that
milled eternally through the streets of the
city

   at dusk they met outside the gate the
sun was soon to set and the air had turned
thin and frigid it cut through their cloth-
ing like knives

   mara huddled against jan trembling and
rubbing her bare arms

   well erick said did you both suc-
ceed

  around them peasants and merchants
were pouring from the entrance leaving the
city to return to their farms and villages
starting the long trip back across the plain
toward the hills beyond none of them
noticed the shivering girl and the young
man and the old priest standing by the wall

  mines in place jan said on the
other side of the city on the extreme edge
buried by a well

   mines in the industrial section mara
whispered her teeth chattering jan give
me something to put over me im
freezing

    good erick said then the three coils
should trisect dead center if the models
vere correct he looked up at the darken-
ing sky already stars were beginning to
show two dots the evening patrol moved
slowly toward the horizon lets hurry it
wont be long

   hey joined the line of martians moving
along the road away from the city behind
them the city was losing itself in the
sombre tones of night its black spires dis-
appearing into darkness

  they walked silently with the country
people until the flat ridge of dead trees
became visible on the horizon then they
left the road and turned off walking
toward the trees

   almost time erick said he increased
his pace looking back at jan and mara
impatiently

  come on

   they hurried making their way through

the twilight stumbling over rocks and dead
branches up the side of the ridge at the
top erick halted standing with his hands oil
his hips looking back

   see he murmured the city the last
time well ever see it this way

   can i sit down mara said my feet
hurt me

   jan pulled at ericks sleeve hurry
erick not much time left he laughed
nervously if everything goes right well be
able to look at it-forever

   but not like this erick murmured he
squatted down snapping his case open he
took some tubes and wiring out and as-
sembled them together on the ground at
the peak of the ridge a small pyramid of
wire and plastic grew shaped by his expert
hands

   at last he grunted standing up all
right

   is it pointed directly at the city mara
asked anxiously looking down at the
pyramid

   erick nodded yes its placed accord-
ing- he stopped suddenly stiffening
get back its time hurry

   jan ran down the far side of the slope
away from the city pulling mara with him
erick came quickly after still looking back
at the distant spires almost lost in the night
sky

  down

   jan sprawled out mara beside him her
trembling body pressed against his erick
settled down into the sand and dead
branches still trying to see i want to see
it he murmured a miracle i want to
see-

   a flash a blinding burst of violet light
lit up the sky erick clapped his hands over
his eyes the flash whitened growing
larger expanding suddenly there was a
roar and a furious hot wind rushed past
him throwing him on his face in the sand
the hot dry wind licked and seared at
them crackling the bits of branches into
flame mara and jan shut their eyes pressed
tightly together

   god- erick muttered

   the storm passed they opened their
eyes slowly the sky was still alive with
fire a drifting cloud of sparks that was
beginning to dissipate with the night wind
the crystal crypt

erick stood up unsteadily helping jan and
mara to their feet the three of them stood
staring silently across the dark waste the
black plain none of them speaking

   the city was gone

   at last erick turned away that parts
done he said now the rest give me a
hand jan therell be a thousand patrol
ships around here in a minute

   i see one already mara said pointing
up a spot winked in the sky a rapidly
moving spot theyre coming erick
there was a throb of chill fear in her voice

   i know erick and jan squatted on the
ground around the pyramid of tubes and
plastic pulling the pyramid apart hie
pyramid was fused fused together like
molten glass erick tore the pieces away
with trembling fingers from the remains
of the pyramid he pulled something forth
something he held up high trying to make
it out in the darkness jan and mara came
close to see both staring up intently almost
without breathing

   there it is erick said there

in his hand was a globe a small trans-
parent globe of glass within the glass
something moved something minute and
fragile spires almost too small to be seen
microscopic a complex web swimming
within the hollow glass globe a web of
spires a city

  erick put the globe into the case and
snapped it shut lets go he said they
began to lope back through the trees back
the way they had come before well
change in the car he said as they ran
i think wc should keep these clothes on
until were actually inside the car we still
might encounter someone

   iu be glad to get my own clothing on
again jan said i feel funny in these little
pants

  how do you think i feel mara
gasped im freezing in this what there
is of itm

  all young martian brides dress that
way erick said he clutched the case
tightly as they ran i think it looks fine

   thank you mara said but it is cold

  what do you suppose theyll think
jan asked theyll assume the city was
destroyed wont they thats certain

   yes erick said theyll be sure it
 was blown up we can count on that and
 it will be damn important to us that they
 think so

   the car should be around here some-
place mara said slowing down

no farther on erick said past that
little hill over there in the ravine by the
trees its so hard to see where we are
shall i light something jan said

  no there may be patrols around
who-

   he halted abruptly jan and mara stopped
 beside him what- mara began

   a light glimmered something stirred in
 the darkness there was a sound

   quick erick rasped he dropped
throwing the case far away from him into
the bushes he straightened up tensely

   a figure loomed up moving through the
darkness and behind it came more figures
men soldiers in uniform the light flashed
up brightly blinding them erick closed
his eyes the light left him touching mara
and jan standing silently together clasp-
ing hands then it flickcd down to the
ground and around in a circle

   a leiter stepped forward a tall figure
 in black with his soldiers close behind him
 their guns ready you three the leiter
 said who are you dont move stand
 where you are

   he came up to erick peering at him in-
 tently his hard martian face without ex-
 pression he went all around erick exam-
 ining his robes his sleeves

   please- erick began in a quavering
voice but the leiter cut him off

   ill do the talking who are you three
 what are you doing here speak up

  we-we are going back to our vil-
lage erick muttered staring down his
hands folded we were in the city and
now we are going home

   one of the soldiers spoke into a mouth-
 piece he clicked it off and put it away

   come with me the leiter said were
 taking you in hurry along

   in back to the city

   one of the soldiers laughed the city
 is gone he said all thats left of it you
 can put in the palm of your hand

   but what happened mara said

   no one knows come on hurry it up
planet stories

 b

  there was a sound a soldier came
quickly out of the darkness a senior
leiter he said coming this way he
disappeared again

 a senior leiter the soldiers stood
xa waiting standing at a respectful
attention a moment later the senior leiter
stepped into the light a black-clad old man
his ancient face thin and hard like a birds
eyes bright and alert he looked from
erick to jan

  who are these people he demanded
  villagers going back home

  no theyre not they dont stand like
villagers villagers slump-diet poor food
these people are not villagers i myself
came from the hills and i know

   he stepped close to erick looking keenly
into his face who are you look at his
chin- he never shaved with a sharpened
stone something is wrong here

  in his hand a rod of pale lire flashed
the city is gone and with it at least half
the leiter council it is very strange a
flash then heat and a wind but it was not
fission i am puzzled all at once the city
has vanished nothing is left but a depres-
sion in the sand

  well take them in the other leiter
said soldiers surround them make
certain that-

  run erick cried he struck out
knocking the rod from the senior leiters
hand they were all running soldiers shout-
ing flashing their lights stumbling against
each other in the darkness erick dropped
to his knees groping frantically in the
bushes his fingers closed over the handle
of the case and he leaped up in terran he
shouted to mara and jan

  hurry to the car run he set off
down the slope stumbling through the
darkness he could hear soldiers behind
him soldiers running and falling a body
collided against him and he struck out
someplace behind him there was a hiss and
a section of the slope went up in flames
the leiters rod-

  erick mara cried from the darkness
he ran toward her suddenly he slipped
falling on a stone confusion and firing
the sound of excited voices

  erick is that you jan caught hold of

him helping him up the car its over
here wheres mara

  im here maras voice came over

here by the car

  a light flashed a tree went up in a puff
of fire and erick felt the singe of the heat
against his face he and jan made their
way toward the girl maras hand caught
his in the darkness

  now the car erick said if they
havent got to it he slid down the slope
into the ravine fumbling in the darkness
reaching and holding onto the handle of the
case reaching reaching-

  he touched something cold and smooth
metal a metal door handle relief flooded
through him ive found it jan get inside
mara come on he pushed jan past him
into the car mara slipped in after jan her
small agile body crowding in beside him

  stop a voice shouted from above
theres no use hiding in that ravine well
get you come up and-

  the sound of voices was drowned out by
the roar of the cars motor a moment later
they shot into the darkness the car rising
into the air treetops broke and cracked
under them as erickturned the car from
side to side avoiding the groping shafts of
pale light from below the last furious
thrusts from the two leiters and their sol-
diers

  then they were away above the trees
high in the air gaining speed each moment
leaving the knot of martians far behind

  toward marsport jan said to erick
right

  erick nodded yes well land outside
the field in the hills we can change back
to our regular clothing there our commer-
cial clothing damn it- well be lucky if
we can get there in time for the ship

  the last ship mara whispered her
chest rising and falling what if we dont
get there in time

  erick looked down at the leather case in
his lap well have to get there he
murmured we must

for a long time there was silence
thacher stared at erickson the older
man was leaning back in his chair sipping
a little of his drink mara and jan were
silent
the crystal crypt



   so you didnt destroy the city
thacher said you didnt destroy it at all
you shrank it down and put it in a glass
globe in a paperweight and now youre
salesmen again with a sample case of office
supplies

  erickson smiled he opened the briefcase
and reaching into it he brought out the glass
globe paperweight he held it up looking
into it yes we stole the city from the
martians thats how we got by the lie
detector it was true that we knew nothing
about a destroyed city

  but why thacher said why steal a
city why not merely bomb it

  ransom mara said fervently- gazing
into the globe her dark eyes bright their
biggest city half of their council- in
ericks hand

  mars will have to do what terra asks
erickson said now terra will be able to
make her commercial demands felt maybe
there wont even be a war perhaps terra
will get her way without fighting still
smiling he put the globe back into the
brief case and locked it

  quite a story thacher said what an
amazing process reduction of size- a
whole city reduced to microscopic dimen-
sions amazing no wonder you were able
to escape with such daring as that no one
could hope to stop you

  he looked down at the brief case on the
floor underneath them the jets murmured
and vibrated evenly as the ship moved

through space toward distant terra

  we still have quite a way to go jan
said youve heard our story thacher
why not tell us yours what sort of line
are you in whats your business

  yes mara said  what do you do
what do i do thacher said well
if you like ill show you he reached into
his coat and brought out something some-
thing that flashed and glinted something
slender a rod of pale fire

  the three stared at it sickened shock
settled over them slowly

  thacher held the rod loosely calmly
pointing it at erickson we knew you three
were on this ship he said there was no
doubt of that but we did not know what
had become of the city my theory was
that the city had not been destroyed at all
that something else had happened to it
council instruments measured a sudden loss
of mass in that area a decrease equal to the
mass of the city somehow the city had
been spirited away not destroyed but i
could not convince the other council leiters
of it i had to follow you alone

  thacher turned a little nodding to the
men sitting at the bar the men rose at
once coming toward the table

  a very interesting process you hsve
mars will benefit a great deal from it per-
haps it will even turn the tide in our faor
when we return to marsport i wish to
begin work on it at once and now if yku
will please pass me the briefcase-

by robert sampson

it was up to jerill to think fast    to do something
   before those strange beasts sucked away the

last purified ore on

shouting wave of men rioted
through the engine room

   from the bridge above the hulk-
ing atomics chief engineer durval vollied
orders in a thunderous voice you men-
you he raged use your heads not your
feet drive them toward the door

  a scattering of them-compact darting
beasts the color of a poppy-scuttled into
the shadow of an engine heavy davison
wrenches clubbed futilely behind them

   as durval flew into new bursts of shout-
ing scott jerill first mate of the freighter
bertha grimly shook his head his lean face
was not smiling now call your men back
he commanded crisply we dont have
time to drive those cats out like this

   durval turned on him with a snarl take
over then think of a better way if you
hadnt hauled that load of space cats aboard
in the first place  

   look out scott snapped

   with a crisp smack a red creature the
size of a mans hand struck the rail before
them it was all improbable angles with
no special shape no front or back it
teetered crazily over the ten foot drop to the
floor below then it settled sputtering it
sounded curiously like an angry cat

   theres one roared durval his wrench
slashed down crashed shrilly on the rail as
the cat skimmed effortlessly away the
wrench shot off toward the floor

   durval shook his hand and roared the
cat some twenty feet down the rail
cackled insanely as scott stepped slowdy
toward it the cat hissed bounded off the
rail and down the steps to the engine room
flocrf

   scott shook his head youre not going
to catch them by hand better let them settle
down durval



the freighter bertha

   settle down the chief brought the
palm of his hand down on the rail the rail
trembled theyve already settled down
on every generator in the place one of
them crawled under the main relay swatch
and shorted out half the board didnt hurt
him a bit

   scott interrupted gruffly weve got to
get them out of here fast captain elder-
burg wants to blast off here day after to-
morrow and we dont have half the ore
cargo purified yet

   and you wont have durval snapped
if we blast off well do it with an empty
hold i cant purify uranium with fifty cats
running loose getting caught in the
machinery it cant be done get these cats
out and ill give you a hold full of the best
grade uranium earth ever bought but not
till you get those cats out

   scowling scott bit his knuckles weve
got to get moving hie skipper thinks ip
metals is going to jump our claim he
said urgently

   it you ask me only a doddering fool
would bring these things into a space ship
he glanced sharply at scott whats this
about ipm

   scott shook his head slowly nothing
forget i said anything but get these cats
out and fast have you tried ultra-sonics
on them

durvals face slipped into new lines
maybe he muttered leaning over
the railing he thundered masters forget
those cats a minute yes forget them hook
up an ultra-sonics sender and-

  the ship intercom over durvals head
clicked mechanically hummed into life
mr jerill report to central control mi
jerill report-

	planet

  scott jabbed the acknowledgement but-
ton as he swung around durval he glanced
down into the engine room sweating men
beat after the scuttling red beasts

  report to me about the sonics he told
durval if that doesnt work well scoop
up those red kitties with our bare hands
but we got to get started on that uranium
ore purification faster than ten minutes

ag-m

  he slammed the engine room door cut-
ting off durvals angry roar striding
rapidly through the bluish light of the cor-
ridor an anger bitter as durvals throbbed
in him but he took pains to hold it down

  confound those cats he thought the
kastil on top of us and we have to stop
work to chase space fauna and we have
three days left three days

  so engrossed was he in anger that he
almost blundered headon into the grinning
red-head who lounged up the corridor
toward him

  hey scott second mate max vaugn
raised a lazy eyebrow slow down think
of all your ulcers

   scott spun impatiently on his heel cant
stop max got to see the captain

  and you dont even stop to say hello to
an old friend back from the mines of a
nameless asteroid he grinned slapped
scotts shoulder lightly with an open palm
whats all this scandal i hear about your
space cats

  scott grimaced i caught a few while
we were scooping up ore over at my pit
thought the extra-terrestrial life division
back on earth might be interested in them
they dont eat they dont breathe   
only their cage got smashed open and
they got into the engine room nobody
knows how

  the good news has got around max
said grinning you dont know it but
theres twenty more sitting outside the main
cargo hatch right now what gets rid of
them

  if you think of anything scott said
as he turned away tell me got to go
elderburgs waiting

  have you tried hitting them with strong
light max shouted after him

  no scott shouted back he was very
late and the old man wanted you fast

stories

when he wanted you try light if you get
a chance

  he broke into an effortless trot his
boots padding lightly on the shining gray
floor three days he thought he forgot
max he forgot durval and the cats he
thought three days and a fine film of
perspiration spread cold across his back

tte have three days captain el-
vv derburg said he was a small neat
man with a prim voice his bland eyes
peered forward into some middle distance
ignoring scott

   and scott sitting tautly in his chair felt
glad those eyes were not on him

  in three days the captain said or
probably before the kastil should find us
the kastil - the best ship inner - planet
metals ever commissioned

   scott nodded in the savage free-for-all
world of the space-miner the kastil was
known as the big ship the new ship the
ship that could load its cargo hatches in a
day stuffing  tons of ore down in
its belly for the hungering plants of earth

   ive fought ip metals for fifteen years
elderburg said slowly his eyes were very
far away for fifteen years theyve grown
bigger and bigger and the bigger theyve
got the rougher theyve played you know
their record scott murder claim-jumping
what they cant steal with a blaster they
take by law

  glancing through the open port behind
the captains head out into the star-
dappled dark of space scott asked is
there any way we can set up a permanent
claim here on this asteroid without going
back to earth

  you know better than that elder-
burgs eyes turned full on scott unless we
bring a full cargo or reasonably purified ore
to earth we cant lay claim to these mines
or to any other mineral rights here

  his hands closed neatly one inside the
other and weve got to get a cargo back
this is our last chance a strike as rich as
this one will keep us going for a long time
but if we lose this claim to ipm the day
of the independent miner are over done
with we might as well sell the bertha and
get out

   well be out of here in two days scott
feline red



said eagerly if we  

   if said elderburg very plainly his
eyes turned away from scott and his hands
went all loose at once and spread out flat
on the table

   if we cannot load in two days mister
jeriil if your cats that you so foolishly
brought on board the bertha delay us so
much that the kastil locates us and beats
us home with a load of ore if that happens
mister jeriil i will see that you are black-
listed from the rolls of every space flight
unit now operating you will be completely
responsible for the failure of this cruise
slumping back in his seat he grinned
maliciously at scott  realize that our com-
pany was offering you a captains position at
the end of the expedition 

  scott stood up anger hammered power-
fully at his temples all right i admit i
made a mistake and i take full responsi-
bility for my actions

   you must admit mister jeriil that only
a fool would bring an unknown space beast
into a ship

   only a fool would deny that the cats are
as valuable as uranium in their own way
now mister jeriil be very careful
there was no mistaking the venom in
elderburgs speech in his passionless black
eyes viciousness lay coilcd your cats have
stopped purification of the crudc ore for
two days two days mister scott we might
have been earth-bound by this time

   scott leaned over the desk in a voice
quivering with anger he said listen to
me if you  

  there was a shocking blast of light
stunning volumes of white light poured
from the port behind the captains head
it blazed too brilliantly for the naked eye

  with a strangled exclamation scott
stumbled for the port clutching his eyes
his fingers clawed nervelessly for the light
control

   there was a sharp snap as the port closed
they felt rather than saw the light flick
abruptly out elderburg tore at the door

   they lurched into the corridor green-
yellow lights flashed before their dazzled
eyes scott located the wall and began to
run using his finger tips as guides

  a magnesium flare the captains
words drove at scott hard as fragments of

metal what fool set off a magnesium
flare with the kastil on top of us

   they stumbled through the cool corridor
to the second level air lock as they ap-
proached the lock clanged open a space-
suited figure waddled into the corridor the
helmet opened back revealing the vivid red
hair of second mate vaugn

   light dont bother those cats a bit
he announced then his grin faded
whats the matter

  the captain croaked you set off a
flare-when-when the kastil has been
hunting our claim for weeks when theyre
right on top of us

   maxs face blanched the kastil scott
you never told me  sudden cunning
swept his face why didnt you tell me the
kastil was so close scott why did you
tell me to try light on the cats when you
knew-

   scott told you elderburg snarled but
at that moment scott cried out sharply
pointing out through the port by the air

lock

   two miles beyond the berthat settled a
black cigar bluewhite fire flared from its
base the kastil scott gasped useless
rage flooded his chest the kastil-and
shes found us

under the hurtling jet the surface of
the asteroid was a jagged tangle of
stone scott staring tensely from the ob-
servation port felt a swift moment of won-
der two hours since the ipm ship had
landed and he was in trouble with a
vengeance

   as lie had left the ship with a party of
picked men he had felt elderburgs cold
eyes on him eyes that thought - and
threatened

   it was easy enough to read the old mans
mind an officer might make one vital mis-
take but not two-not introducing the cats
into the ship not permitting a flare to be
set off unless   

   unless he wanted the bertha to lose time
unless he wanted the kastil to find the
precious claim

  cold raced through scotts veins his
hands locked white about the space helmet
he was about to don he had to prove his
loyalty had to prove that the accidents


planet stories

were accidents and little time was left as
the kastil could load completely in two
days

   theres the pit mister jerill the navi-
gators voice was strained see anybody
not yet set her down

  the cargo jet dipped the vast peaks of
shattered stone sped up at them with ter-
rifying speed scott refrained from closing
his eyes saw the razor-toothed surface of
this shattered world streak toward him
ahead the bulk of the kastil loomed they
must have used the ore pits as a landing
narker he thought and-what was that
motion at the lip of the ore pit

  the jet grounded hissing on the burnt
landing strip watch it scott warned
we got visitors out there

  there was an ugly muttering among the
men as scott threw open the cargo doors
and dropped to the rocky ground he saw
the crewmen checking blasters and the
slender polonium tubes that could perma-
nently blind a man

  he stepped away from the jet and as he
did so seven men detached themselves from
the shadows about the mines edge and
strolled toward him seven men-two more
than were with scott the odds might be
worse he thought with a sense of relief

   cautiously he loosened the blaster in his
belt they were tricky weapons to handle
in space gloves but hed better be ready to
use it fast

  party from the bertha the words
came thin and metallic into scotts helmet
right he grunted you

  from the kastil who gave you a
clearance to land on our claim

   we have a prior claim on this pit scott
flared we have it posted and registered if
youre going to mine find someplace else
a giant figure grimly grotesque in a
cumbersome vacuum suit swaggered for-
ward i dont see any of your claim posts
scott indicated a tall metal stake glitter-
ing somberly in the glare of the jets load-
ing lights

  the tall man laughed easily his voicc
thin and far away in scotts helmet think
of a better story we just dug that claimer
in ourselves now suppose you people jet
out of here ought to be plenty of good
claims someplace else

   scott scarcely heard the sudden bitter
burst of protest from his men his body felt
light and cool the blaster pressed hard
against his side there are plenty of
good claims he said you better go find
them

  he swung the blaster up in a single
smooth motion

   the tall man stood very still they were
not close enough to see each others faces

   then high on a plateau of stone above
the tall mans head scott saw the stats
blot out

   scatter as he shouted he took a giant
leap to the right

   a blast of energy seared from the dark-
ness gouging a vast hole where scott bad

stood

   from behind a boulder he could see the
fire of the blaster sweep across the upper
edges of the rocks just at the level where
the stars were cut off

   for a moment the cold green line of his
fire flicked harmlessly over naked stone
then a thick squirt of fire flared quickly a
still-born scream died in his earphones

   the men of the kastil had dodged away
into the darkness

   scotts voice rang out harshly ill give
you men two minutes to organize and get
out of here if youre not out by that time
well spin our jet around and burn you out

   there was a brief stir off in the shadows

   youre in a blind alley there scott
continued theres no way out and well
blast any man who tries to climb out over
the rocks is that clear

  a glowing flash of energy exploded
against the rock protecting him there was
no sound but bits of stone lightly flecked
his suit scott braced himself on the rough
face of the boulder and worked the blaster
around for an open shot

   no more shooting the heavy voice of
the tall man growled you bertha people
can you hear me

   yes scott said coldly his eyes probed
the shadows for motion

   were willing to be peaceful about this
im captain randell of the kastil theres
no need for killing when theres plenty of
ore for all of us

   not in this pit scott answered you
have one minute
feline red



   all right randells voice distorted as
it was by the tiny radio carried a sardonic
edge well go-from here

   he sauntered out of the shadows hands
upraised from the tangle of stone his men
crept out to join him without haste inso-
lent in their retreat they crossed over the

 pifc-

   at the far side they paused this is the
extent of your so-called claim randells
voice purred in their ears our claim ex-
tends from this line and if a man from
the bertha wants a quick blasting he can
cross this line his radio snapped off with
crisp finality

   scott stepped from his shelter

    all right he ordered you men know
the story the kastils down here ready for
work and its going to mean work if were
going to beat her back to earth now lets
go but watch your step

they worked eighteen hours a day
they worked from the steel-like ground
they scoopcd a dozen tons of the dirty
black uranium ore and sent it hurtling
back to the bertha

   but in spite of all their efforts the more
modern equipment of the kaslil overtook
them in a day the blackness on their left
was riddled with the flare of digging
torches and the slender fire-trails of the jets
soaring between the pit and the kastil

  and now and again randells drawling
voicc broke into scotts ears youre slow-
ing up bertha seventy tons for us today
are you poor little men getting tired he
clucked sympathetically then burst into a
yell of laughter well have the ore cleaned
off this rock before you get half loaded

  but scott and the men of the bertha
worked silently with savage haste for-
getting sleep and food to keep the tonnage
flowing to their ship they had almost
forgotten the cats   

   but not for long

  staggering with fatigue scott swayed
into central control and sagged into a
seat he had been too long in a space suit
a dull pounding beat behind his eyes i
came as soon as you called the pit captain
elderburg you sounded pretty urgent

  its urgent elderburg said were
beaten

   scott stiffened fatigue fell from him as
he gazed closely at the captain saw for
the first time the bitter dullness of elder-
burgs eyes

  you better come with me the old mar-
said heavily he rose stiffly led the way
from the room

   in silence they shuffled down the corri-
dor toward the engine room a tic worked
at the corner of the captains mouth but
he did not seem to notice it durval held
the cats off with ultra-sonics he purified
about ten tons of the stuff and stored it
they threaded their way along a chill
black catwalk to the center of the ship in
the engine room men slumped sullenly
among the big atomics as scott and elder-
burg passed a group of the black gang
mutely dangling wrenches there was a
sudden stir

  thats him one of the men had
leaped up the wrench whipped back over
his shoulder he leaped raging toward
scott theres the rotten   

  easy billy he was dragged back
disarmed

   howd the kastil know   

  the captain tugged scotts arm dont
bother with them come on

  scott nodded numbly followed his head
aching and a nameless wave of apprehen-
sion sliding through him where are the
cats he asked once

  elderburg ignored him put on a radia-
tion suit

  they had stopped before a side door of
the main hold as scott struggled into the
suit his mind swirled in a chaos of
thoughts when the suit was adjusted he
dropped the helmet shut and stepped for-
ward through the lighter gravity of the
air lock they lumbered then ekkrburg
spun the controls that opened the door

  there you are he said to scott he
sounded completely deflated no sting re-
mained in his voice

   scott stepped forward into the hold then
froze his body went cold

  the hold was a writhing mass of cats
their queer angled bodies darted in a
great pile beyond the door their red
bodies glowed and twisted strangely they
flew about a huge stack of lead containers-
uranium cells secured for the long trip home


planet stories

   and scott went sick with understanding
through rigid lips he forced the words
energy-eaters

  the captain laughed oddly and you
wondered how they lived on this naked
rock they ate the raw ore of course no
wonder they hung around durvals ma-
chines sucking up what free energy they
could they broke through the air feeder
system here no wonder with cells of
 pure uranium waiting for them his
voice broke

   so were finished he continued the
kastil will be loaded before we can even
clean the cats out were done

  he swayed back against the bulkhead
scott took his arm

  get away from me elderburg
wrenched away his loathing clear even be-
hind the bulky suit if what the men say
is true if you sold us out- his voice
trailed off call your men out of the pits
jeriil were blasting off tonight

  no scott leaned forward his eyes
mere slits behind the lense -of his heiiet
mis there any uranium left

   we saved two cells

   its enough scott snapped his lean
jaw lifted proudly its a little late cap-
tain but i can promise to get rid of the
cats in two hours with the ore deposits
vaugn and i have collected we can still
load a good cargo and beat the kastil out
by at least a day

  elderburg eyed him sharply how can
you handle the cats

  get me a lead-lined box about eight
feet by  

   static blasted shrilly in their ears the
voice of the ships lookout strained with
excitement shouted capiain elderburg
this is main control get here fast an
explosion at lieutenant jerihs mine

   as elderburg leaped for the door with a
muffled roar the lookouts voice tautened
no no not an explosion its the kastil
theyre attacking the mine theyre attack-
ing the mine

they crammed into the observation
blister on the berthas nose scanners
swept smoothly over the wilderness of stone
jutting up between the ship and the mine
theres a fire fight going out there

elderburgs square face knotted with anger
scott take a party blow that livid scum
crew off this rock

   right sir scott bolted from the ob-
servation port the emergency alarm how led
through the ship he buckled on a pair of
blasters with unsteady hands a black fury
sweeping him he stabbed one long finger
down on the intercom

   masters he yelled get the cargo jet
ready with full battle equipment

   right lieutenant whats up

   piracy he spun toward the door then
jolted to a halt hands balling at his sides

  a picture was forming on the master
communication screen

  elderburg pounded to his side who
is it

   the picture on the screen was very defi-
nite now-a swarthy giant of a man cyni-
cally grinning down at them gentlemen
the figure on the screen said and scott
needed no further introduction

   it was randell master of the ship kastil
weve had a very entertaining two
days randell said his thick hands rubbed
easily together its been a real pleasure
watching you work but im afraid the
pleasure is over were leaving you now
oh that disturbance at your mine pit he
laughed but only with his mouth the close-
set eyes remained unchanging watchful
it seemed so unnecessary to bother mining
ore when so much of it was stacked near
our pit

  you bloody murdering bandit elder-
burg thundered well blast you   
youll blast nobody any party ap-
proaching the kastil will get blasted any
party near the claim-our claim-will get
burned down by the way im afraid your
men at the mine contracted space-sickness
or something they seem to be dead you
neednt bother coming after them

  he began to chuckle i think the ore
my men are bringing in now will just com-
plete our cargo see you back on earth

  the screen went gray the sound shut
off with a loud click

  elderburg swung on scott take your
men clean out that nest of thieves before
they remove any more ore order out full
battle gear well blast the kastil apart if
it takes every man on board this ship

j  i

  no scott caught elderburgs shoulder
gripped him there isnt time for an
armed attack i have a better idea

  scott i order you to

  get me a box scott cried desperately

made of lead and six feet deep
elderburg jerked his shoulder free his
face contorted get to your cabin jerill
youre under arrest

  captain elderburg listen to me we
can 

  thats a direct order go to your cabin
he whirled away from scott slammed
down the intercom lever attention all
hands prepare full battle equipment  

  scott slashed his blaster hard across the
back of the captains head elderburg stag-
gered clutched the back of the seat scott
hit him again elderburgs legs went loose
he toppled face forward struck the inter-
com and sagged to the floor

  scott stepped to the intercom atten-
tion all men prepare full battle equip-
ment and stand by stand by durval get
the largest lead-lined box you have and set
it outside the entrance of the main cargo
hatch shake it up we have half an hour
till the kastil jets off

  he cut off the intercom lugged elder-
burg to the chart room and locked him
inside

the hold was beastly hot standing inside
the hatchway holding suspended over
his head a three-foot long cell of uranium
ore scott felt a moment of shuddering
panic over the storage cells along the wall
over the tumbling bodies of the cats an
eerie glow quivered-the menacing flare
of radio-activity

  scott glanced nervously at the forward
screen chief durval waved toward him
your men ready durval

  the chief nodded dont go getting
yourself hurt now scott

  scott grinned although he did not feel
much like grinning

  he shuffled forward under the light
gravity of the hold the uranium cell bal-
anced easily in his hands too easily he
could scarcely feel it press against his
gloves the heat control in his suit was
jammed again his hands streamed sweat
he inched past the cats a quick cold

thrill passed through his stomach with tin
energy of the ore almost gone the scarlet
beasts were growing increasingly uneasy
they were casting about for a new supply
it would be easy enough for a foot to slip
he thought to spill the ore across the floor
new food for the cats-and the loss of the
berthas last chance as strange space beasts
sucked away the last purified ore

  he slipped cautiously past the last row
of cells a quick dash now for the open
hatchway beyond   

  half a dozen of the bounding red beasts
surged about his feet their weight drove
his right leg forward he staggered caught
at his balance the lead cell above his head
began to slip

  watch it scott durvals voice cracked
in his ears

  straining every muscle against the queer
weightlessness of no gravity scott struggled
t tlgain his balance he expected another
blow at his legs as the cats leaped for the
ore it was hard to breathe the over-heated
air of his suit

  but the cats had spun away as he caught
his balance he stared after them uncompre-
hending for an instant the cats ran twist-
ing in a somehow sinister dance the
bodies were queerly bloated down the
upper portion of their bodies ran a heavy
indentation as they leaped and twisted ihc-
indentation became a fissure a crevice

  then two of the beasts leaped slammed
together in mid-air but more than two cats
fell to the floor

  their sharply angled bodies whisking
back toward the depleted uranium cells
four cats appeared with shocking sudden-
ness

  reproduction elemental fission

  scott had to clean them out and fast
soon the ship would be overrun with the
energy-hungry felines

  he dashed toward the open hatch out-
side the opening a great lead box eight
feet by eight feet gaped upward beyond
four men tensely supported a vast lead
cover

  is the uranium poured into the box
he barked sharply

  yes sir all ready mister jerill

  good turning from the hatch he
inverted his cell poured out the uranium


planet stories

ore in a thick stream from the open hatch
back across the hold toward the scrambling
mass of cats upon the now empty rows of
cells

   but he never reached the beasts

  a brawling torrent of animals leaped
toward him hurling the container into
their mass he leaped to one side they
lunged into the trail of ore rolled leaped
darted along the line at the hatch edge
t pyramiding mass of cats paused a moment
then plummeted over scott fell back
against the bulkhead his eyes fixed on the
cits still scavenging among the empty cells

   then these too were darting for the trail
of ore the uranium was scattered now cats
plunged toward the new radiation in the
box beyond the hold entrance

   the inarticulate cheers of durval and his
men rang in scotts helmet but his mind
was already working at the next step of the
problem

   durval he ordered get a decontami-
nation unit in here clean this placc- out
cats poured in a frenzied stream from the
ship call mister vaugn start purification
of his ore as soon as it arrives

   past the hatch he saw the swift flash of
die lead top dropping over the box excite-
ment pounded hotly in his throat

   tm going to get rid of these cats once
tad for all he called be back in an
hour

   but what about the kastil

   well worry about the kastl later get
that ore purified were blasting out of here
ie forty hours

   he swung frem the cargo entrance to the
top of the lead box under his feet the lid
trembled with the frantic struggling of the
cats load this crate in the cargo jet he
cried and hurry we only have half an
hour left

the pounding of the jets matched the
pounding of the blood in scotts
temples when we land he instructed
get this crate out fast everything depends
on how fast you can take the cats down to
the pit i want you to bury it as fast as you
can understand

   he glanced sharply about the group feel-
ing their eyes clinging to him

  get as much rubbish on the crate as

possible and then obey every order i give
you as fast as possible no matter how foolish
the order may seem

  the jet thundered down over the land-
ing strip rasped to a halt out roared
scott fast make it fast

  the loading compartment swung open
but as the men lifted the crate toward the
door the jets intercom burst into life
jerill jerill this is captain elderburg i
order you to return at once

   elderburg had freed himself too quickly
this is a criminal offense jerill come
back at once

  get that crate out scott roared
hurry hurry

  mister jerill blared the intercom
you are under arrest according to the
articles of space for conspiracy armed
assault  scott cut the voice off in mid-
sentence he leaped into the hold threw his
weight behind the box quick get it to
the pit

  the men lumbered off into the darkness
even with the light gravity of the asteroid
it was difficult to handle the crate as the
scrambling cats pitched it from side to side

  scott scaled a boulder the hulk of the
kastil loomed just beyond dark and threat-
ening a thin square of light showed at
their cargo entrance they were still com-
pleting loading

  hurry scott muttered feverishly
hurry

  the men reached the pit carefully
slowly they lowered the crate into the
shadows

   sweat streaming down his face scott tore
his eyes from the kastil hatch grimly
watched as his men scooped rubbish into
the pit

  a motion in the darkness out where no
motion should be movement among the
sunless stones

   scotts breathing stopped

  a group of men closing in toward the
cargo jet men racing out of the shadows
men of the kastil

   stop scott shouted frantically into his
radio get that crate back to the jet get it
out of the pit back to the jet its too late
harry hurry

  for a single astounded moment the men
paused then sweeping the rubble from
feline red



the crate they fumbled it toward the surface
of the pit

  scott leaped down among them pushed
theyre going to trap us the crate struck
on the pits edge scott seized one end
forced it up over grab that other end
masters move man dont argue move
staggering over the uneven ground they
lurched toward the jet

   i think you ought to rest for a moment
it was the cool voice of randell who
stepped from the darkness with a blaster
turned full on them

crewmen from th kastil poured from
among the rocks their blasters swung
a menacing ring about scott and his men

  step back away from the crate ran-
dell stepped forward tapped his blaster
against the side of the box now what do
we have here

  keep away from that scott snarlc-d
thats property of the bertha

   is it randell turned carelessly to his
men property of the bertha he drawled
well wed better have a look at it now
to make sure you havent accidentally sal-
vaged some of the kastils equipment oh
quite by accident i understand

  he began to loosen the screw-clamps of
the lid

  stop scott leaped forward no longer
conscious of the weapons swinging on him
he dropped his hand upon the box

   iliis is mine he said i forbid you to
touch it

have you ever seen a man die of a
blaster bolt randell asked step back
the men of the bertha fell back their
shoulders touched the toothed rim of stone
about the pit

  randell chuckled perhaps its just as

well we didnt blast off when we were
loaded there was always a chance youd
found something else of value here

he flicked the muzzle of the blaster
about if you dont mind well inspect this
crate in a better light back at the kastil 
triumph leaped through scott this is
piracy he said and sounded sincere

  piracy is what is proven randell
laughed do you really think you have a
case in our courts he sighed softly
now thank you for this unexpected
pleasure and good-bye well see each
other again on earth perhaps

  then they were gone and immediately
afterward the kastil balancing on a white
line of flame leaped away from the asteroid
and flashed out past the stars

   scott stared after it a faint smile touch-
ing his lips about him rang the triumphant
laughter of the crew

  somie gripped scotts shoulder cap-
tain elderberg on the intercom mister
scott i just told him and-congratula-
tions sir

  scott grinned entering the jet he faced
the intercom said its over now captain
good work mister scott elderburgs
voice was unsteady how did you do it
pretended to be taking something of
value scott said he relaxed back against
the seat i knew randell couldnt resist
making a clean sweep of everything we had
so i gave him the chance

  elderburgs laugh filled the cabin and
when they open the crate  

  good-bye uranium pale eyes smiling
scott waved a knotted fist and now sir
were going to start mining ore this is our
claim now and well be blasting out of
here in forty hours with the biggest load of
uranium ore earth ever got its hands on
narakan rifles about face

by jan smith

         those crazy sloppy frog-like narakans    all thumbs and
         six-inch skulls    relics of the suzi swamps until four-fisted
         lt terrence omara moved among them-lethal danger-
         ous with a steady purpose flaming in his volcanic eyes

terrence omara lay flat on his

back trying to keep his big body as
still as possible despite the fact that
he was stripped to his regulation shorts a
large pool of sweat had formed on the
cot underneath him the only movement
he permitted himself was an occasional
pursing of his lips as he dragged on a ciga-
rette and sent a swirl of smoke upward
through the heavy humid air then he
would just lie there watching as the smoke
crept up to mingle with the large drops of

water that were forming on the concrete
of the command post

  damn damn naraka anyway outpost
of civilization whod want the blasted
place except the rumi

  at the words terrence moved his head
just a fraction of an inch and his eyes only
a little farther to look across the room to
where bill fielding was twisting and turn-
ing on his cot all he could sec of the other
mao was the wet outline of his body under
a once white sheet and a hand that every



planet stories

so often reached into a bucket of water on
the floor and then replaced a soaking t-
xhiri over a red head

   youil feel it less if you lie still ter-
rence said distressed at the necessity for
talking

   feel it less my god listen to the man
what difference does it make if you lie still
or move around or even run around in the
suns like a bloody greenback dust bin
will get you one way or another    and
if it doesnt the rumi will

  the visible hand lifted the t-shirt and
began to pop salt tablets into an open
mouth like they were so many pepper-
mints

  t wonder where norton is out review-
ing the troops

  reviewing my eye hes up at govern-
ment house sitting in that cool living room
drinking one of mrs wilsons icy drinks
and admiring mrs wilsons shapely legs
from a discreet distance of course being
temporary commanding officer of even
dust bin has its privileges 

  there was a rattle of drums and the
blare of one or two off-key instruments
from outside

  then why asked terrence are those
poof beggars marching up and down in
this blasted heat

  the greenbacks they love it it would
take more than a little heat to get under
those inch-thick skins of theirs they like to
play soldier when its a hundred and thirty
under water

  there were a few more straggling notes
and then die semblance of a march began

  listen to that will you fielding
moaned they cant even keep time with a
drum they cant march they cant shoot
they cant break down a banning theyre
all thumbs and six-inch thick skulls train
local forces to take over bali did those
desk jockeys back in new chicago ever see
a greenback did they ever try to teach a
narakan to fix a bayonet to the proper end
of x rifle or to fire a blaster in the right
direction

terrence was lighting another cigar-
ette with as little exertion as possible
yes but they keep trying ten hours a day
you dont have to drive those boys they

want to learn listen to oshaughnessy bark-
ing out orders

  sergeant major oshaughnessy of the
first narakan rifles fielding murmured
sarcastically a year- ago he was squatting
in a mud cocoon at the bottom of suzi
swamp with the rest of the frogs now hes
got a good irish name and hes strutting
around like a martian field marshal

  i thought the names might give them a
sense of self respect besides we couldnt
pronounce theirs and i was tired of hearing
norris yell hey greenboy at them
well they picked the right guy when
they made you training officcr you and
those damn frogs get along like you came
from the same county

   they arent any great shakes for brains
but you cant take anything away from me
bys for willingness

  willingness hooray theyre willing
so what so is a suzi swamp lizard whatll
it get them a week after they pull the
terran forces out the rumi will gobble up
the lot of them maybe theyll gobble them
and us before we pull out who could fight
in this place whod want to fight i say
to hell with naraka its so near to hell
already with those two blasted suns blazing
sixteen hours a day let the rumi have the
stinking planet let them have the whole
centaurian system

  speaking of pulling out i wouldnt be
surprised if dust bin wasnt the next place
we let go of  

  fielding raised himself on one elbow
no kidding where did you hear that
his sunburned and blistered face was alight
with excitement

  well you know how its been when we
first came here twenty years back we drove
the rumi out of all this country and more
or less took their cat feet off the narakans
backs but now that so much of the earth
garrison has been pulled all the way back
into the solar system the rumi are acting
up again so much so that die dope i got is
that we may be pulling everything back into
die little texas peninsula to wait for re-
inforcements and it will take four years for
those to come out from mars

   great great but    ah its too good
to be true cant you just picture fielding
and omara parading down dobi street in
narakan rifles about face



new chicago with their first lieutenant bars
on their collars say you dont suppose
thats why the sun maid is sticking around
out here do you imagine free transpor-
tation a two hour trip to new chi
ltd sure hate to march those two hun-
dred miles at this time of year

   march through those swamps every
time we run a patrol through them  

   fielding was interrupted by a knock on
the door and a skinny young terran with
sergeants chevrons on his shorts stuck his
head through from the other room and said
major chapelles on the voice radio sir
hes calling from battalion headquarters
and wants captain norton

   tell him nortons up playing footsies
with the residents wife fielding said
youd think those people down at the river
would have enough to do without bothering
us in the heat of the day wouldnt you
the sergeant looked shocked and started
to withdraw his head terrence frowned
fielding into silence and called to the ser-
geant just a minute rogers ill talk to
the major

   major chapelle was a thickset balding
man in his late forties even the blazing
suns of naraka hadnt succeeded in burning
the sickly yellow color off his face in the
vision screen he looked like a man on his
last legs whatever was wrong with him
didnt help his temper terrence thought
as he lowered himself gently into a seat
before the screen

   omara where in hell is norton he
demanded

   well sir you see  began terrence
never mind ive a pretty good idea
where he is a fine time to be chasing
skirts well get this straight omara
orders have come through and were pull-
ing the battalion out were ordered back
to little texas were going to give up
these positions along the river tonight and
pull back into dust bin the sun maid will
stand by to evacuate us you people are to
come too everybody has to get out both
the military and civilians all hells broken
loose down river the rumi are across the
muddy in half a dozen places theyve cut
the  th to pieces new chicago thinks that
those cats have been bringing troops in from
space all along despite the agreement by

both sides not to do so and now they have
us way outnumbered the majors voice
held a thin edge of hysteria

   is there any action along our front
major terrence asked quickly hoping to
stop the flow of talk before chapelles
hysteria communicated itself to the enlisted
men who were sitting or lying about the
command post

   not yet just patrols across the river so
far weve got to get out omara and get
out fast theyll be all over us if we dont
the colonel says for norton to have every-
thing ready to go he wants the depot
destroyed everythings got to go everything
we cant take along the sun maid wont
have time for more than one trip he wants
the hq company and the civilians on board
by tomorrow morning at the latest

   what about the rifles sir
   jwhat the what

   the native troops sir lire narakan
rifles terrence grated

  the rifles good god man wc
havent time for nonsense lie rifles are
only greenbacks arent they you get
norton started burning those stores
terrence put down the microphone ray
carefully to keep from slamming it down
and stalked back into his quarters angrily
he began to take his radiation clothing from
its hooks on the wall

   what the devil is eating you de-
manded bill fielding

   were pulling out lock stock and
barrel terrence told him

  pulling out whoweee i knew mrs
fielding didnt raise her boy to be a fried
egg goodbye dust bin hello new chi
bill was up on his hands and knees pound-
ing on his cot but whats the matter with
you you like this place

   theyre leaving the rifles terrence
said zipping up his protective coveralls as
he left the room

ii

stepping outside on naraka with the
full power of alpha and beta centauri j
beating down was like stepping into a rivet
of fire even with the cooling unit in his
suit terrence was aware of the searing heat
that filled the parade ground looking off


planet stories

across the makeshift native huts he could
see the bright sides of a huge space ship-like
object the big dirigible sun maid was lying
in an open field its a funny world he
thought to himself where you have to use
dirigibles for planetary travel but a diri-
gible was the only practical aircraft when
you had to use steam turbine engines be-
cause of the lack of gasoline and the
economic impracticability of transporting it
in the limited cargo holds of the occasional
spacers that came out from sol

  the narakan rifle were marching toward
him now the band doing absolutely nothing
for the wearing of the green three hun-
dred big green bodied beady eyed frog-
like creatures were marching in the boiling
heat with their non-coms croaking out
orders in english which might have come
out of alice in wonderland

  as they marched by him he snapped a
salute watching them closely he tried to
find two men who were in step with each
other or one man who had his rifle at the
right angle unable to find either he stood
there conscious of failure failure which
went beyond mere military precision how-
ever sloppiness at review could have been
overlooked if he had been able to find that
the narakans had any ability as fighting
men but after a year of training they seemed
almost as hopeless as they had at first it
wasnt that they were completely unintelli-
gent in fact other than the galactic travel-
ing rumi they were the only extra-solar
race of intelligent beings encountered by
man so far it was just he thought that the
hundreds of years during which the rumi
had dominated their planet had reduced the
narakans to a state of almost complete
ineptitude

   he stood there as they passed in review-
three times because he knew that his pres-
ence pleased and encouraged them then he
turned and with dragging feet made his
way down dust bins single street toward
government house

  in a few minutes he was standing in the
cool air conditioned living room of the
wilsons wilson was seated at his desk
rummaging through some papers while
norris and mrs wilson were lounging in
contour chairs admiring each other over tall
frosty drinks

   they took the news just as he expected
them to wilson ran his hand through his
sparse gray hair and murmured something
about it being a shame to have to leave
the natives on their own after having more
or less dragged them out of their com-
fortable swamps a glance from his wife
silenced him

   what the hell norris said theyre
only blasted thick witted greenbacks

   mrs wilson yawned itll be something
of a bother packing but itll certainly be a
pleasure to get back to new chicago some
womens husbands get good posts in half-
way civilized parts of the universe i dont
know why i should always have to be stuck
in every backwater hick town there is
wilson smiled apologetically now
dear  he began but was interrupted by
the sudden ringing of the telephone on the
table near norris chair

   get that will you omara the captain
said making  attempt to reach for it its
probably the command post

   terrence put the phone to his ear angrily
and growled into it an excited bill field-
ing was on the line terry is that you
fielding here hells breaking loose theres
a bunch of blasted rumi trying to force
their way into town they attacked the
sentries down this way and may be heading
for your end of town too

  terrence dropped the phone and headed
for the door  rumi lie shouted and there
were shouts and cries from outside in an-
swer then he heard the clack clack clack
of rumi spring guns windows of the
room crashed in and wilson collapsed
across his desk norton grabbed mrs wil-
son and pulled her down onto the floor
terrence dropped to his hands and knees
and continued toward the door as he drew
his forty-five

somewhere someone had cut loose
with a banning and its high whine
drowned out the clack of the spring guns
with a quick look around terrence started
at a run for the next building which was the
native schoolhouse he didnt make it
there was a clack clack from oif to his left
and he threw himself forward skidding
and sliding in the dust and gravel of the
street a warehouse across the square was
narakan rifles about face



on fire and three rumi had darted from
behind it in one brief glance he saw those
long barreled spring guns of theirs and the
tall graceful bodies and the feline faces
under the plastic protective clothing

  he snapped four shots at them and saw
one fall then he began to slither along the
ground raising enough dust to mask his
movements there were half a dozen of
them in the square when he reached the rear
door of the schoolhouse several gleaming
plastic bolts smashed into the wooden outer
door a second after he had raised up to open
it and then had dropped back down

  norton fired from the residency and mo-
mentarily scattered the rumi and terrence
was inside the school room and racing for
the side window from which lie could get
a clear line of fire at the raiders he had a
brief glimpse of joan allen the school
teacher standing in a corner of the room
with the tiny green figures of native chil-
dren huddled around her then he was at
a window and had beaten out the heavy pro-
tective glass and was firing into a mass of
the catmen firing and cursing as his gun
emptied he cursed in a stream of martian
english and greenback profanity as he
forced another clip into the gun

  lieutenant omara if youll be so kind
as to restrain your language in front of
these children a voice said from over his
shoulder

  terrence reached back and felt something
soft and forced it over against the wall out
of the line of the window then he risked
a quick look which was almost his last a
spring gun bolt burned a groove in the
windowsill next to his head and smashed
into the blackboard across the room

  lieutenant omara would you mind
telling me what this is all about came the
same calm determined womans voice from
beside him he fired again at a darting
figure across the square and saw it stumble
before he had to drop to his haunches as
the window above him was smashed and
scattered by bolts and glass rained down
about his head

  he put another clip into his gun and
cursed because he had only two left he
turned his bead briefly and had a quick
glimpse of a white face framed in straight

-planet-january

dark hair and a small neat figure in a
yellow dress

  rumi attack one of their patrols must
have gotten around the battalion

  a husky whimpering little sound made
him look down a native child or pollywog
as the terrans called them was clinging
desperately to the teachers skirt his tiny
webbed feet clutched at the cloth as be
buried his face against her leg from behind
her peered still another child itsbaby frog
face working spasmodically in the begin-
nings of a sob six or seven others were lying
flat on the floor their bodies trembling in
terror

  terrence took another look outside and
what he saw sent him into another stream
of cursing the narakan rifles were hurry-
ing to the scene of action down the middle
of the street they came in a column of
fours with their drums and bugles blaring
out a poor imitation of the wearing of the
green their standard bearer was running
at the head of the column beside sergeant
major oshaughnessy

  oh my god he wouldnt   m

   lieutenant please

   teacher will you shut up he roared as
he leaped across the room toward the front
door at the harsh tone of his voice the
whimpering sounds in the room suddenly
burst forth in full volume as the ten poily-
wogs raised their hoarse voices into full
throated croaks

   terrence braced his body against the wall
and held his gun ready as he pulled open
the door in parade formation his men were
moving up the street and in a moment they
would be away from the buildings protec-
tion and directly in the rumi line of fire

  oshaughnessy you idiot he roared
above the croaking from behind him and
the rattle of firing outside

  oshaughnessy came to a skidding halt
almost directly in front of the schoolhouse
but his men kept on going their faces set
and determined oshaughnessy came to
attention and snapped a salute

   yes sir mr lieutenant

  halt damn it halt terrence yelled
at the column of greenbacks their forma-
tion crumbled as they ran into each other
stepped on each others feet and pushed
and shoved but they halted
planet stories



  shaughnessy break ranks   take
cover    line of skirmishers terrence
shouted and hit the dirt behind a sandbox
in the schoolyard as the rumi resumed
firing there was a mad scramble among
the narakans as they scattered behind walls
and into buildings moving with an in-
credibly rapid jumping motion which they
used when in a hurry

  terrence was so glad to see only one
sprawled figure in the dust of the street that
he just lay there for a few seconds spitting
dust before he realized that he had for-
gotten to close the face visor of his radia-
tion clothing

there was a slight clucking sound from
beside him and when he turned he
found oshaughnessy lying almost beside
him squinting along his carbine hie nara-
kans face split into two replicas of the map
of ireland and he saluted flat handed his
webbed fingers at just the proper angle

   oshaughnessy you dont have to salute
when youre lying down omara tried to
keep his voice as calm as possible

  yes sir mr lieutenant pretty quick
we fight now

  his lieutenant ignored him and searched
for signs of life in the houses across the
square there wasnt a rumi in sight except
for one on the roof of a shed next to the
burning warehouse he tried a couple of
shots with his automatic and missed he
grabbed oshaughnessys carbine and
dropped the creature as it tried to scramble
off the shed

  pretty soon we fight with bayonet
oshaughnessy asked as terrence handed
back the carbine

  oshaughnessy why do you do things
like this to me me who took you out of
your damn mud hole and made a soldier
out of you

  oshaughnessys mouth formed a huge
round moon not understand lieuten-
ant  he began but he was ignored again
as terrence stared across the street in pained
disbelief to where the heavy weapons squad
of the narakan rifles was gathered in a
huddled group behind a native house
struggling to set up their banning auto-
matic blaster and two machine guns one
ot the men was down on his hands and

knees balancing the heavy barrel of the
blaster on his back while two others were
attempting to push the ponderous breech
onto it by main strength the two machine
guns were half on and half oft their tripods
the leg of one of them had been bent in
the wrong direction and the other was so
covered with grease that the parts wouldn t

fit together

   oh lord moaned terrence and was
bracing himself for a dash across the street
when a figure in terran battle armor came
around the building on the run dodging
and crawling as spring bolts raised the dust
in front of him it was the short stout gun-
nery sergeant polasky terrence breathed
a sigh of relief

  he turned to oshaughnessy now
sergeant this is our problem those build-
ings over there are filled with rumi they
have automatic weapons    spring guns
firing a clip of twenty plastic bolts theyre
deadly at close to medium range they can
penetrate our battle armor he looked at
the thick knobby skin of the narakan
yours too now they are probably just a
patrol about the size of one of our com-
panies they dont seem to have any heavy
weapons and ours will be in action in a few
minutes then oshaughnessy   the
narakan was squinting along the barrel of
his rifle

   are you paying attention sergeant

   yes sir attention yes sir oshaugh-
nessy started to lift his bulky three hundred
pounds up off the ground terrence heaved
with all his might against those thick khaki
clad legs to knock him down again

   man what are you doing he yelled

   attention sir sir said  

   no no oshaughnessy i meant listen
to me oshaughnessy how could you
havent i been like a brother to you didnt
i share my whiskey and candy ration with
you

   yes sir thats why  

   then for the sake of your two headed
frog-faced gods shut up and listen to me

   yes sir

   look in a minute our banning will be
in action his voice was drowned out by
the scream of tortured air as the banning
cut loose now there is a sweet sound
what do we do next oshaughnessy
narakan rifles about face



   one of the row of buildings across the
square glowed red briefly as the beam from
the blaster caught it glowed red and then
burst into a ball of fire oshaughnessys
mouth was open wide his chinless face
resting on the edge of the sandbox and his
little black bead eyes were as large as they
could get

   what do we do now oshaughnessy  
come on   

  the narakan made a thrusting gesture
with his carbine bayonet  we go in
with bayonet nowm he said

  omara slapped him on the seat of his
khaki pants no no you got to get this
stuff straight

  the whine of the banning interrupted
him again and it was joined by the chattcr
of machine guns and rifle fire and answered
by the rapid clacking of spring guns bolts
dug into the wall of the schoolhouse and
showered them with plaster others shat-
tered the front window terrence wiped
plaster off his visor and tried again youve
got to get this straight oshaughnessy
because    well because you may be
getting an independent command pretty
soon and there wont be anyone around to
tell you what to do

  the narakan was listening to him
but wide-mouthed and uncomprehending
were going to bum them out of those
huts burn them out or burn the houses
down over their heads about the time
polasky gets to the third one those guys are
going to break and then theyll either rush
us or  

  norton was yelling something from the
residency there was a noise of clanking
armor behind him and he could hear field-
ings voice cracking out orders as he came
up with twenty hastily armed and armored
clerks cooks and radiomen from the hq
unit

  omara omara theyre breaking
theyre running lets go norton was on
the porch of the residency pouring tommy
gun slugs at the rear of the burning row of
houses

   okay lets go terrence said lurching
to his feet the narakan sergeant blew his
whistle and the riflemen swarmed out from
their shelters and started at a run across
the square with norton terrence and

oshaughnessy at their head the rest of
the terrans in full battle armor lumbered
along after them

  one or two bolts whistled overhead and
corporal obrien dropped his rifle and fell
forward clutching his leg the smoke from
the burning buildings obscured their vision
but terrence had a momentary sight of
rumi radiation clothing and emptied his
clip at it

  someone from behind threw a grenade
which fell short of its target and rolled in
front of them norton took two quick
strides and kicked it into one of the flaming
buildings

ill

there were about twenty rumi less
than they had thought fleeing across the
open fields behind the burning huts they
were firing as they ran and giving out those
queer yelping cries of theirs three or four
of them fell and then norton was shouting
calling back his men to organize fire fight-
ing parties

  captain captain lets go after those
guys we can cut them oft before they get
to the grasslands terrence yelled

   get your men after these fires omara
we cant let them spread

  there was nothing to do but obey but he
delayed long enough to empty his automatic
in the general direction of the fleeing rumi
then he turned and yelled harrigan
sergeant harrigan where in the devil is
that   there was a crashing sound
behind him and harrigan stumbled through
the smoke and came down on his foot all
three hundred pounds of him

   later as the last smoking embers of the
fire were being smothered by industrious
squads of narakans with buckets and
shovels terrence limped back across the
square with bill fielding

  we should have gone after those lousy
scum bill said they may cut back around
the town again and give the battalion some-
trouble on the river road

  dont you think i know it as fast as
the greenbacks can move when they want
to we could have caught the lot of them
before they got into the grasslands but
norton was worried about the fires of


planet stories

course were going to burn all these build-
ings tomorrow or the next day but norton
was afraid the residency would catch fire
probably didnt want his sweeties fancy
clothes to burn

   they got wilson you know

   good lord dead

   right between the eyes they almost
got all four of us

   fielding took his heavy battle helmet off
and pushed back the glass visor of his radia-
tion helmet to wipe the perspiration and dirt
oft his face well maybe norton didnt
want us to catch those damn cats maybe
he figured he owed them that much
omara shielded his eyes as he said
betas setting itll be night in a couple
of hours and we can walk around without
this blasted radiation armor for a while
yeah and we can start looking for a
full scale night attack as soon as good old
alpha hides his hoary head

   if you see oshaughnessy tell him i
want to see him will you im going to stop
at the schoolhouse for a few minutes
surprise spread across bills freckled face
not the school teacher not you buddy
youve been in dust bin too long youve
been on naraka too long youll be attend-
ing services at the chapel next

   terrence muttered a few old anglo-saxon
words under his breath and limped off in
the direction of the school building

the reverend ames goodman was the
smallest narakan that terrence had ever
seen the johnathian missionary from little
texas was somewhat under two hundred
and fifty pounds which was slight for a
greenback he also spoke the best english
except for some of the big shots in new
chicago ordinarily he was a composite of
supcrstjous reverence and natural dignity
which terrence had always found admir-
able today however he couldnt have
appeared more ludicrous if he had tried
he was dressed for a visit to the residency
in a white duck suit which was too small
and out of which he bulged in a number of
surprising places

   he and joan allen were talking half in
engliih and half in narakan as the lieu-
tenant entered the minister had a painfully
surprised look on his round green face

   i hope we didnt bust up your school
too much miss allen

   if you are quite finished with your
shooting and cursing lieutenant omara
perhaps you have time to explain to rev
goodman and me what this talk about evacu-
ation means

   as she spoke she brushed stray strands
 of black hair up under her radiation helmet
 for the first time in the six months that she
 had been in charge of the orphan school in
 dust bin terrence decided that maybe she
 was pretty after all he wasnt sure whether
 it was the high color which excitement lent
 to her usually pale face or if bill fielding
 was right in saying he had been on naraka
 too long but joan allen was beginning to
 look good to him at the moment the
 feeling wasnt at all mutual

    is it true that the defense force is
 pulling out and leaving the rest of us to
 the rumi

   terrence took off his helmet and let the
 rapidly cooling air strike his head not
 exactly teacher he said the fifth is
 pulling out but so are all the terrans in
 dust bin everyones being ordered back to
 little texas thats why the sun maid is
 standing by

   all the terrans lieutenant what
about the people here who depend on us
what about my children

   omara somehow couldnt quite look
either of them in the face he muttered
something about having to get back to his
command post and started out the door
joan called after him as she noticed his
limp lieutenant im sorry i didnt know
you have been wounded

    oh its nothing    nothing he said
 hurrying away his neck reddening from
 something more than the attention of beta
 centauri how in the name of narakas sixty
 devils could you tell a woman that one of
 your own non-coms had stepped on your
 foot and nearly broken your instep

   the battalion straggled into dust bin
during the night it hadnt exactly fought its
way back from the river but had had enough
casualties to make the men nervous and
jumpy without tempering them at all one
of the casualties had been lt colonel
upton now major chapelle was in com-
mand the men of the battalion were
narakan rifles abqut face



 nervous but chapelle was riding on the thin
 edge of panic he ordered everyone on
 board the sun maid at once and then
 countermanded the order and formed a
 defense perimeter around the town he
 threw out patrols which were unable to
 contact any rumi on die dust bin side
 of the river

  the next morning terrence was sum-
moned to government house for an officers
conference as he hurried along its single
street dust bin was in a state of confused
and helpless excitement the three or four
hundred narakans who made up its popula-
tion were all in the street or square many
of them were carrying their belongings on
their shoulders and looked as if they were
only waiting for an order of some kind to
send them scurrying off toward the suzi
swamps

  as omara reached the veranda of the
residency rev goodman was speaking
with joan allen by his side his words
were aimed at chapelle norton and a
large gray-eyed man whom terrence recog-
nized as the captain of the sun maid

  when you came you earthmen in your
great ships the narakan was a hunted
creature on his own planet and had been
back as far as he could remember you
drove off the rumi and took parts of the
planet for your own use but you did not
hunt the narakan you brought him out of
his swamps and taught him much to wear
clothes to till the ground and many other
things you even gave him your religion
but now the rumi have returned and you
say you are not strong enough to hold all
the planet

tvtajor chapelle was impatient
lvl thats right reverend theres too
many of them the garrison just isnt big
enough to hold everything and its too far
back to earth for us to expect any reinforce-
ments for a year or even longer

  norton took over youre an educated
   all    man goodman you see what
the problem is we cant hold everything
so weve got to cut our losses all of the
most important resources and towns are in
the little texas area and so were pulling
back into there

  i see yes i understand the people of

dust bin are part of the losses that must
be cat

  now now dont put it that way
reverend the natives can always take
refuge in the swamps you know

  yes t suppose it must be so back to
little texas for the terrans and back to
the swamps for the narakans back to liv-
ing naked in the mud back to fishing for
our food and back to thinking only of the
next meal

  it really isnt that bad chapelle said
as soon as the situation adjusts itself the
terran forces will be coming back then
you can come out of your hiding places and
resume your regular life again

  yes and in the meantime our only
problem will be to stay out of the way of
the rumi

  i dont believe that they will go out of
their way to harm you its the terrans they
want to drive out

  suddenly the reverend goodman was
shaking his fist in the majors face for-
getting in his excitement both his manners
and his correct english not hurt not
hurt mr general no they not hurt they
just eat they favorite food is naraka
steak

  now now calm yourself norton put
a hand on goodmans shoulder there s
plenty of room in the sun maid for you and
the rest of your people will be safe enough
in the swamps

  what about my children demanded
joan allen

  children miss allen i dont know 
oh yes you mean the poly    the chil-
dren why i assume they will go with
their parents

  joan placed a small fist firmly on each
of her slim hips major all the children in
the mission school are orphans they have
no parents none of them have ever lived
in the swamps

  ah yes but i hardly see what we can
do about it miss allen

  well major im going to tell you what
im going to do about it unless those kids
are loaded on the sun maid in place of
some of this junk she waved a hand at
the piles of luggage which belonged to mrs
wilson im going to stay with my charges
and leave you with the problem of explain-


planet stories

ing to the mission board and to the bishop
of new chicago just why you left me
behind

   at the mention of the extremely influen-
tial johnathian bishop the major looked
more worried than ever after a short con-
ference with norton he turned to joan

   very well miss allen the children will
go in the airship im sure that mrs wilson
will be only too glad to leave some of her
clothes to make room for them

  thank you major joan said making
no attempt to gloat over her victory

  now captain i understand that most
of the military stores have been destroyed
and that the men are ready for embarka-
tion chapelle went on hurriedly address-
ing himself to the captain of the sun maid
we will have about three hundred and
twenty no    about three hundred and
thirty passengers for you

   the captain shook his head doubtfully
its a big load i hope we can make it
without any trouble

   well then chapelle went on well
go aboard during the day after we complete
the destruction of the stores and facil-
ities the native troops under lieutenant
oshaughnessy will cover our embarkation
and then convoy the civilians as far as the
suzi swamps afterwards they will march
overland to fort craven on the little texas
border

   terrence had never had any urge to be a
hero he had always pictured himself re-
tiring at a ripe old age as a colonel or
brigadier and raising canal oranges on mars
but suddenly the memory of the narakan
rifles rushing down the street with bugles
blaring and flag waving right into the rumi
line of fire rose before him the thought of
oshaughnessy even with his new lieuten-
ants commission leading the blundering
troops along the two hundred miles to fort
craven was too much for him

  i beg your pardon major he heard
himself saying but as the narakan train-
ing officer i think that i should remain in
command of the unit in its overland
march 

  the major was dumfounded norton
looked as if he were sure the narakan
climate had proven too much of a strain
for die lieutenant

   lieutenant omara are you sure   
began chapelle

  are you nuts omara do you know
what youre asking for demanded norton

   yes sir i feel that since colonel upton
appointed me training officer for the
narakan rifles it is my duty to stay with
them until i am relieved

  chapelles look of astonishment had
changed to one of relief it would be far
easier to explain the hurried abandonment
of the narakan rifles to the native repre-
sentatives at new chicago if a terran offi-
cer were to remain with them

  well he said i could of course
relieve you of your responsibility but if you
feel that  

   i do sir terrence said quickly lest he
be tempted to back out

iv

later in the day as he sat in the shade
of the command posts overhanging
roof with his back against a stack of sand-
bags he cursed himself for sixteen kinds
of an idiot as he watched the evacuation
begin beta was dropping low over the pink
maldo hills as the long line of earthmen
filed up the gangway into the big airship

  hello said a voice behind him he
turned to find joan allen standing there
clothed in radiation armor and holding a
small canvas bag in one hand i thought
 i mean  i came to say good-bye
hello yourself i thought you were on
board with the rest of them he got up
hastily

  no i got the kids on board but i
wanted one more look at the schoolhouse
before we shoved off

  somehow he was holding onto her arm
i guess it meant a lot to you that school-
house he said

   yes it did i  i was afraid that i
wouldnt get to see you when you get to
new chicago

   theres no danger of that joanie if
and when i get there ill be looking for
you    that is  if you want to see me
if you think you can stand an old maid
school teacher ill be looking for you
she was very close to him now why did
you do it terrence why are you making
narakan rifles about face



the march with the narakans fielding says
your chances arent very good

  iu thank fielding to keep his big
mouth shut i dont really know why prob-
ably kind of an earthmans burden
noblesse oblige    you know    some-
thing like the sort of thing kipling used to
write about

   hell she said surprising him with her
vehemence you dont believe that guy
any more than i do it was old when kip-
ling wrote it and its even older now i think
that somewhere under that tough irish
skin of yours theres a sentimental fool
hiding

   she was still closer now with her hands
pressed lightly against his chest and sud-
denly his arms went around her he lifted
her protective visor and forced his lips
down hard on hers all of her primness had
disappeared as she leaned against him re-
turning his kiss with a burning eagerness
which a more experienced woman might
have controlled

   there were tears running down his cheeks
and he knew they werent his he released
her slightly and looked down into her tear
streaked face wondering how it was pos-
sible for them to have been at the same post
for six months without really knowing each
other

   i guess im kind of crazy about you
teacher he said

   he had lifted her off her feet and she
clung there with her arms around his neck
terrence i cant leave you    i  

   as terrcnce bent over to kiss her again
there was a loud cough and bill fielding
was standing there dressed in full battle
armor he grinned and said much as i
hate to break this up i dont think
chapelle is going to hold the sun maid
much longer

   terrcnce set joan gently on her feet and
she turned and fled toward the waiting
ship he watched until she wras on board
and then turned to stare at bill still grin-
ning broadly bill clapped him on the
shoulder as he said i could never have
faced those bartenders on dobi street if i
had gone back without you we better get
going hadnt we sergeant polaskys down
with the men he couldnt bear to leave his
bannings

   well ill be damned was all o mra
could find to say as he watched the big
airship lift itself in the fading light circle
and pass through the smoke of dust bin
for the last time

throwing their gear over their shoul-
ders the two officers crossed the parade
ground to where the two hundred khaki
clad figures of the narakan rifles stood
waiting with sergeant polasky clucking
slightly as he fussed over his bannings

  oshaughnessy was wearing his new
lieutenant bars and a pith helmet and was
carrying a large piece of wood in imitation
of nortons swagger stick terrence took
one look at him and at the two orderlies
who stood behind him holding his field kit
he strode toward him scowling placed his
fists on his hips and stood glaring up at the
greenback as he roared so its delusions
of grandeur youve got is it where are
hannigan and otoole and their patrols
why arent they back

   oshaughnessy stiffened to attention try-
ing to pull in his great stomach they are
back mr lieutenant sir  i forgot they
had nothing to report  no contact

   terrence looked him up and down if
you foul up just once more    im going
to  ill split your gizzard stuff it with
to-to leaves and send you to the rumi for
their breakfast with my compliments
oshaughnessy shivered at the dire threat
as omara turned to rev goodman who
stood with his people clustered about him
all right reverend you can move out
with your flock ill throw patrols out in
front of you and bring up the rear with the
rest of the rifles well see you as far as
the edge of the swamps

   in a long straggly line the refugees
started out with the native police keeping
order and goodman marching at their head
the two drums and the three bugles of
the narakan rifles struck up a badly
mangled version of back to donegal and
the column followed on the heels of the
civilians once or twice terrence glanced
back at the smoke and flame that had been
dust bin before he turned his face forward
across the miles of grasslands to where the
suzi swamps lay

   darkness had fallen but progress wasnt


planet stories

difficult until one of those sudden lashing
storms for which naraka was famous hurled
itself upon them flattening the tali grass
raising swirls of dust and finally turning
the dust into thick clinging mud

  as suddenly as it had come the storm
was gone but by that time they were in the
swamp itself night in the suzi swamps
swamps composed of a sticky gray mud
and heavy tangled undergrowth the night
was as black as the day had been bright
the column which had left the civilians at
the edge of the swamp was pushing slowly
forward the narakans glided along on
their bare webbed feet and the terrans
pushed along on snowshoe-like glides
attached to their boots

   bill fielding bareheaded with his helmet
thrown back over his shoulder floundered
along beside terrence did you ever see a
place like this did you ever see mud like
this even the irish bogs couldnt be this
bad

   terrence checked his map shielding his
flashlight carefully well be out of the
worst of this by tomorrow morning he
said

  if we live until tomorrow morning
yielding replied those rumi have eyes
like the blasted jungle cats theyre descended
from

  i dont think we have much to worry
about until we get out of the swamps i
doubt if their patrols would penetratevery
deeply into this mess

   how about the radio has polasky been
able to get through to fort graven asked
fielding

  omara shook his head no you know
what beta s radiations do to radio reception
this time of year even at night it takes a
powerful transmitter to reach farther than
twenty or thirty miles

   later in the night with a good ten miles
of swamp country between him and the
enemy terrence called a halt on a slightly
raised spot of almost dry ground the un-
wearied greenbacks and the exhausted
terrans dropped down in huddled groups
the patrols that had penetrated to the ede
of the swamp came in to report that they
had contacted no rumi ahead terrence
munched a can of cold beans and fell over

  aa exhausted sleep to the sound of

       

oshaughnessy placing sentries about the
camp

the next days march was a nightmare
to the lieutenant if anything the heat
and humidity were worse in the swamps
than they had been in dust bin and the
going got tougher every mile the mud was
softer and the undergrowth had to be cut
away by bayonet-wielding narakans before
the main body could move through ter-
rence had thrown off his battle armor and
lost his radiation helmet somewhere in the
morass as had other of the earthmen han-
nigan had prepared a thick mess of mud
and grass which the terrans applied to
exposed parts of their bodies

   late in the afternoon of the second day
the narakan rifles came to a tepid little
stream that marked the end of the swamps
and for the first time terrence ordered a
rest of longer than two hours bill fielding
was lying flat on his back in the grass
beside the stream with his feet dangling in
the water shoes and all when omara
dragged himself wearily back from inspect-
ing the pickets and flopped down beside
him

   if i never to my dying day see another
speck of mud fielding muttered as he ate
a bar of tropical chocolate that was as mud
covered as he was   still have seen
more than all the fieldings for two hun-
dred years back have seen on earth and
mars

  and now said terrence as he eased
over on his back with a heavy sigh that
we have run out of mud we can start
looking for rumi

   at least itll be a change here kitty
here kitty nice rumi come and get a
bayonet in   

   clack clack clack  he sound of spring
guns broke the stillness of the afternoon and
was followed by the sound of rifles and a
cry of pain

  oh lord moaned omara now it
starts he was on his feet gripping his
carbine and running bent over fielding
was at his heels dragging a machine gun
off the ground

  oshaughnessy hannigan take the
first platoon move up to support the
pickets otoole on the double take your
narakan rifles about face

squad and try to get around the firing bill
you and polasky stand by here with the rest
of the men and the bannings

   terrence had plunged into the stream and
splashed across and was clambering up the
opposite bank when one of his pickets came
crawling and stumbling back clutching a
wounded arm mr lieutenant mr lieu-
tenant rumi rumi many rumi up ahead
sullivan and oleary dead rumi get

   medic medic oshaughnessy was yell-
ing in his ear with the full-throated croak
of an adult narakan drowning out what
the wounded picket was trying to say

  how many how many rumi man
terrence demanded

   twenty    thirty    maybe thousand
tlie narakan gasped as the medic led him
off

    twenty thirty maybe thousand that
gives us a damn fine idea of what were up
against

   while his men dragged their big bodies
up the bank of the stream omara stood
scowling at the eight foot high grass
usually about a foot high the hardy and
ubiquitous purple grass of naraka grew
far more lushly around the edges of the
swamps he felt that it would be a risky
business at best to plunge into it after an
unknown number of enemy at the same
time he had an illogical determination not
to leave the bodies of his men in the hands
of the rumi he looked at the broad big-
mouthed exaggerations of irish faces around
him heaved a sigh that came from deep in
his chest and ordered all right men
spread out keep low and keep your eyes
open and try not to shoot each other

   we fix bayonets now lieutenant sir
hannigan asked

  you keep your eyes open sergeant
terrence snapped ill tell you when to fix
bayonets

  the noisy rustling of his mens heavy
bodies as they pushed through the grass
made him nervous and irritable then sud-
denly just as they were edging their way
around a gully a dozen rumi were swarm-
ing down on them terrence cut down two
with his carbine but his men were firing
and missing as the incredibly fast catmen
hurtled at them he had a brief glimpse of
oshaughnessy spraying submachine gun

slugs wildly about and then there was a
hail of spring bolts and two of his men were
down the whole platoon was thrashing
through the grass in their direction and the
rumi were gone as quickly as they had
come

    come on terrence shouted breaking
into a run with twenty or thirty riflemen
after him a bolt grazed his cheek and
another cut down a man to his right he
emptied his carbine in the general direction
of the clack clack clack hannigan was
roaring a primitive bull-throated chant and
firing at everything that moved oshaugh-
nessy managed to jam his gun and was
beating frantically at it with one webbed fist
they burst into a clearing filled with rumi
and both sides blazed away at point blank
range it was hard for even a narakan to
miss at that close range and the rumi broke
and ran just as sergeant otoole and his
squad came out of the grass on the other
side of the clearing

  the rumi trapped turned and dashed at
terrence and his men the lieutenant drove
his fist into one cat faced creature and
smashed his empty gun across the head of
another hannigan grappled with one of the
lithe gray-bodied things and slowly crushed
it beneath his  odd pounds oshaugh-
nessy beat another insensible with his
jammed tommy gun several narakans
were down but most of them had taken
rumi with them

  terrence was knocked off his feet by a
gray ball of fury that leaped at him wield-
ing a stiletto-thin knife he caught at the
rumis arm with both hands but the crea-
ture was not only fast but strong it twisted
out of his grasp and slashed at him and only
a quick sideward roll saved him desper-
ately he brought his fist down on his
assailants head

  the rumis grip relaxed slightly and
terrence drove his fist full into its face and
locked his legs about its waist the catman
couldnt have weighed more than a hundred
and fifty pounds but all of it was wiry
strength it clawed at him now ripping his
protective clothing and gashing his legs
meanwhile trying to get its knife into play
he was vaguely conscious that his men had
disposed of the rest of the rumi and were
dancing around him frantically trying to

get a chance to aid him he was struck by
the incongruity of a civilized being
descended from simian ancestors and a
civilized being descended from feline an-
cestors fighting fang and claw while a bunch
of misplaced amphibians danced about them

  making his weight count he suddenly
twisted and hurled the rumi under him but
something hit him a terrific blow on the
back of the head and blackness closed in

v

omara awoke with a head that felt like
all the hangovers of a misspent life
have a nice rest bill fielding asked
terrence reached a weak hand to the back
of his head and felt bandages did i catch
a spring bolt he asked

   bill grinned well no not exactly it
was more on the order of private oharas
rifle butt he was trying to hit the rumi
you were necking with

i might have known terrence groaned
we lost six men but recovered all the
bodies except for one weve got four
wounded    litter cases thought you were
going to make it five for a while

  well they wont slow us down too
much we still have about a hundred and
fifty miles to go well camp here for the
night and move out at dawn

  marching in the early morning and rest-
ing in the heat of the day before another
fternoon march the narakan rifles covered
mother fifty miles of the distance to fort
craven without incident but not without
signs-of rumi twice they came on recently
occupied camps and once they caught sight
of a rumi patrol moving parallel to their
own line of march

  the next morningj which was blistering
and cloudless they were only seventy miles
from the fort

  maybe we ought to give the radio an-
other tty terrence decided were close
enough to have a chance of getting through
now 

   polasky set up the field radio

   hello bailiwick hello bailiwick this
is apple three three can you read me
come in please

  omara and fielding sat and listened
while he repeated die call a dozen or more

times his only answer was the heavy static
that beta produced in most electronic instru-
ments the same static that made radar and
space scanners all but useless that limited
aircraft to the big dirigibles and weapons
to old fashioned rifles and machine guns

    i guess well know whats going on
when we get there terrence said he
wiped his forehead with his arm noticing
that the heavily caked mud was beginning
to crack off he would be in for a bad case
of sun poisoning probably

   a rare breeze had sprung up and drifting
down it from the west came the sound of
gunfire as one man everyone in the camp
stiffened

   did you hear that demanded fielding

   i think i hear a banning polasky said
 sounds like its coming from in back of
us  off to the west

   from what our scouts have been able to
pick up thats the general direction that the
rumi have been moving terrence said

   but theres nothing over that way what
in hell could they be attacking fielding
was on his feet looking off in the direction
from which the sounds were coming

   terrence was aware of an increasingly
uneasy feeling he got to his feet and picked
up his gear the sounds could be deceiv-
ing we might as well get moving it isnt
going to get much cooler before nightfall

a n hour later they were hotly engaged
with a large force of rumi rumi
armed for the first time with heavier
weapons mortar-like guns tiiat hurled pods
of smothering dust that caused almost
instant strangulation rumi who attacked
suddenly giving them time only to drop to
the ground and set up the bannings and
machine guns before three hundred howling
fiends came charging through the grass at
a dead run firing as they came

  o	mara was behind a machine gun and
fielding and polasky each had a banning
in action they met the rumi charge with a
withering hail of lead and fire the nara-
kans lying as flat as their huge chests would
allow them were firing as fast as the auto-
matic rifles would fire the bannings swept
the line of charging figures as the beams
paused for a moment the charge would take
effect and a ball of fire would mushroom
narakan rifles about face



skyward leaving a dozen seared cat bodies
on the ground terrence swept his machine
gun along in a swath behind the bannings
picking off what they left some dozen
catmen made it to within ten yards of their
front but sprawled still or lay kicking briefly
until a greenback put another bullet into
him

  the rumi were gone withdrawing to the
west and terrence was yelling and cursing
at his men to keep them from breaking
ranks and following them three riflemen
and otoole were dead and sergeant
polasky was coughing out his life beside his
banning with a spring gun bolt in his
stomach

  those damn cats he was muttering
when omara reached him those damn
cats we showed em didnt we lieutenant
that bannings a good gun if you 

  they buried the greenbacks in eight foot
graves and the earthman in a seven foot
one those dirty lousy stinking  

bill fielding was beating his fist into the
palm of his hand we got one of them
alive this time terrence hannigan knows
a little of their lingo his old man escaped
from one of their breeding pens on the
other side of the muddy hes working him
over

  in the twenty odd years that terrans and
rumi had occupied different halves of the
same planet the number of men who had
learned the rumi language wouldnt have
filled a small room so terrence was sur-
prised at bills information and hurried
toward the place where the interrogation
was taking place before he got there he
heard a piercing cat cry which ended in a
gurgle and when he reached the group of
greenbacks hannigan was wiping his
bayonet on the grass he stood looking
down at a rumi officer whose throat was
neatly slit from furry ear to furry ear then
fists clenched on his hips he confronted
his men

  mi dont suppose it ever occurred to you
bunch of d imwits that we might have gotten
some information out of this guy he might
have talked you know

  he talk grinned hannigan he talk
plenty he feared we might hurt him we
tell him no hurt if he talk    ha

  he say big flyship down mr lieutea-

ant said oshaughnessy

  what what do you mean demanded
omara

  flyship    sun maid crash in storm
   rumi find

  good god the sun maid terrence
gasped that storm the first night

  they surround and attack terrans
these ones on way to join attack when meet
us oshaughnessy went on

  he tell where ship down hannigan
said it near bend in big muddy    place
i know ten twenty mile back

  the greenbacks were watching the ter-
rans fingering their bayonets eagerly and
hugging their rifles terrence had the im-
pression that they were beginning to like
their jobs he turned to bill fielding
well bill it looks like we came about
twenty miles too far

  bill grinned yep i guess so come on
soldiers fall in we got work to do back
here a piece

  a two hours forced march with the sun
beating down and the sound of firing grow-
ing closer only a column of greenbacks
could have done it and only a crazy irish-
man would have asked them to they came
up over a rise and looked down a gentle
slope toward die brown twisting snake that
was the big muddy on its banks lay the
broken shape of the airship and swarming
across a burned circle around it were rumi
thousands of them the firing had slackened
in the last few minutes and now they could
see why the rumi were assaulting and
were at close grips with the ring of defend-
ing terrans

  now questioned oshaugnessy we
fix bayonets now

  yes replied terrence now we fix
bayonets

  at his word three hundred big clumsy
hands reached for three hundred bayonets
and fixed them to three hundred rifles

  oshea take otooles squad and stand
by up here with the bannings oshaugh-
nessy take the left flank bill you take the
right lets go

  there wasnt a sound out of the rifles
as they started down the hill none of
their usual croakings and bellowings just
silence and the heavy thud of their feet the
rumi had seen them many of those in the
	planet

rear of the attack were swinging about to
face them spring gun bolts began to whiz
in their direction one or two narakans
fell they were closer to the struggle now
closer to the tightly packed rumi and the
hand to hand struggle about the sun maid

  terrence was firing throwing lead into
the gray-bodied mass ahead of him but his
men were just thundering along with their
little black eyes fixed on their old oppres-
sors bayonets leveled in front of them in
approved training school method they re-
sembled nothing so much as a regiment of
tanks hurtling at an enemy the momentum
of their charge carried them half way
through the rumi ranks the terrific force
of the plunging amphibians bowling over
the lighter catmen

  bayonets clubbed rifle and heavy webbed
fist fought against claw teeth and knife
there was almost no firing almost no sound
save for the cries of the rumi and an occa-
sional cheer from the terrans

  terrence emptied his tommy gun hurled
it in the face of a rumi and reached for his
knife and automatic a rumi knocked him
off his feet with the butt end of a spring gun
but before he could do more hannigan
stepped over his lieutenant and plunged his
bayonet into the catman the irishman
scrambled to his feet amidst the gray furry
bodies thrust his a into a snarling face
and pulled the trigger the face disappeared
but another took its place and he fired again
a rumi with a knife grabbed at him from
behind and he raised his pistol again but
the cat was already down with a bayonet
between his shoulders

  the greenbacks were yelling now lifting
those great voices of theirs in full throated
bullfrog croaks the rumi trapped and
desperate were scattering and trying to flee
down river omara stumbled over a barri-
cade of rocks and boxes and almost got a
terran slug in him before he realized that
they had cut their way th rough to the
broken ship he was up in a minute and
urging his men on after the scattering
enemy twenty or thirty of them tried to
make a stand around a tall rumi officer but
oshaughnessy at the head of a wedge of
narakans swept into them at a full run

stories

  their bayonets flashed for a few seconds
and then flashed no more the steel was
covered with blood a few hundred rumi
made it to the river under a hail of lire from
oshea and his squad on the hill hardly
pausing to consider their cat-like aversion
to water most of them plunged in and
struck out for the other shore the rest were
cut down on the bank by onrus-hing green-
backs terrence grabbed hold of one of his
buglers and then had t practically beat the
man over the head to get him to sound
recall

  bill fielding picked his way among the
bodies and came toward terrence holding
his left arm oshaughnessy was leaping up
and down and waving his fist across the
river

  things different now all different
now one greenback better than four five
eight rumi

  at least that many terrence said under
his breath before he roared at oshaughnessy
fall the men in on the double now were
going to march back to the sun maid in
proper military style

  there was a blowing of sergeants
whistles the shouting of corporals and the
narakan rifles slowly formed ranks some
were missing and others were limping and
holding wgunds but they stepped out
smartly as the column headed back up the
river every rifle was at the correct slope
every man was in step as they marched
through the makeshift barricade and past
where chapelle was standing the drum
and bugle corps struck up the wearing of
the green just as omara shouted  eyes
right and every eye swung right in per-
fect unison a tattered and weary chapelle
brought a surprised hand up to salute and
the narakan rifles came to a snappy halt

  a small black haired figure threw itself
at terrence and his arms were again holding
joan allen  knew youd come she said
only a big crazy irishman like you could
do it

  he kissed her and then pressed his mud-
caked face against hers as he said into her
ear only three hundred big crazy irish-
men baby theres not a drop of anything
else in me boys

          by leigh brackett

    fanatic tribesmen might easily have expunged the lone
    earthman from the face of the martian desert instead
    they bequeathed to him bisha    bisha-the
    unwanted bisha-the unnatural

it was dose on midnight both moons
were out of the sky and there was
only blackness below and the mighty
blaze of stars above and between them the
old wind dragging its feet in the dust the
quonset stood by itself a half mile or so
from the canal bank and the town that was
on it fraser looked at it thinking what an
alien intrusion both it and he were in this
place and wondering if he could stick out
the four and a half months still required of
him

  the town slept there was no help for
him there an official order had been given
and so he was tolerated but he was not
welcome except in the big trading cities
earlhmen were unwelcome almost any-
where on mars it was a lonesome deal

  fraser began to walk again he walked a
lot at night the days were ugly and de-
pressing and he spent them inside work-
ing but the nights were glorious not even
the driest desert of earth could produce a
sky like this where the thin air hardly
dimmed the lustre of the stars it was the
one thing he would miss when he went
home

  he walked dressed warmly against the
bitter chill he brooded and he watched
the stars he thought about his diminishing
whiskey supply and the one hundred and
forty-six centuries of written history gone
into the dust that blew and tortured his
sinuses and after a while he saw the
shadow the dark shape that moved against
the wind silent purposeful and swift

  out of the northern desert someone was
riding

  for the space of three heartbeats fraser
stood rigid and frozen squinting through
the darkness and the starshine at that mov-


ing shape then he turned and ran for the
quonset he was not allowed to possess a
weapon and if some of the fanatic northern
tribesmen had decided to come and cleanse
their desert of his defiling presence there
was little he could do but bar the door
and pray

   he did not go inside just yet it was un-
wise to show fear until you had to he
stood by the open door outside the stream
of light that poured from it he waited
tensed for that final leap

  there was only a single rider mounted
on one of the big scaly beasts the martian
nomads use as the earthly desert-folk use
camels fraser relaxed a little but not too
much one man with a spear could be
enough the stranger came slowly into the
light wrapped and muffled against the
night curbing with a strong hand the un-
easy hissings and shyings of the beast at the
unfamiliar smells that came to it from the
quonset fraser leaned forward and sud-
denly the weakness of relief came over him
the rider was a woman and she carried
before her on the saddle pad a child almost
hidden in the folds of her cloak

  fraser gave her the courteous martian
greeting she looked down at him tall and
fierce-eyed hating and yet somehow desper-
ate and presently she said you are the
earthman the doctor

  yes

  the child slept its head lolled back
against the womans body there was some-
thing unnatural in the way it slept undis-
turbed by the light or the voices fraser
said gently i am here only to help

  the womans arm tightened around the
child she looked at fraser and then in
through the open door at the unfamiliar
of


planet stories

alien things that were there her face made
grim and hard by hunger and long marches
and far too proud for weeping crumpled
suddenly toward tears she lifted the bridle-
chain and swung the beast around but be-
fore he had gone his own length she curbed
him again when she had turned once more
toward fraser she was calm as stone

   my child is-ill she said very cjuielly
hesitating over that one word

   fraser held up his arms ill see what
i can do

   the child-a girl fraser saw now per-
haps seven years old-did not stir even
when she was lifted down from the saddle
pad fraser started to carry her inside say-
ing over his shoulder to the woman ill
need to ask some questions you can watch
while i examine-

   a wild harsh cry and a thunder of padded
hoofs drowned out his words he whirled
around and then he ran a little way shout-
ing with the child in his arms but it was
no use the woman was bent low in the
saddle urging the beast on with that frantic
cry digging in the spurs and in a minute
she was gone back into the desert and the
night fraser stood staring after her open-
mouthed and swearing and looking help-
lessly at the girl there was an ominous
finality about the way the woman had left
why even if the child was dying wouldnt
a mother wait to know even if the sickness
was contagious would she ride the lord
knew how many miles across the desert
with her and then run

there were no answers to those ques-
tions fraser gave up and went into
the quonset kicking the door shut behind
him passing through his combination
living-quarters and office he went into the
tiny infirmary which adjoined his equally
small but well-equipped lab neither office
nor infirmary had had many customers the
martians preferred their own methods their
own healers fraser was not supposed any-
way to be the local gp the medical
foundation grant and the order of the
martian authorities permitting him to be
here both stated that he was engaged in
research on certain viruses non-cooperation
of the populace had not made his work any
easier

  he became suddenly hopeful about the
child

  some two hours later he put her still
sleeping into the neat white bed and sat
down in the room outside where he could
watch her through the open door he had
a drink and then another and lighted a
cigarette with hands that had trouble putting
flame and tip together

  she was sound as a dollar thin a bit
undersized and undernourished like most
martian youngsters but healthy there was
nothing whatever the matter with her ex-
cept that someone had thoroughly drugged
her

  fraser rose and flung open the outer
door he went out staring with a kind of
desperation into the north straining his
ears for a sound of hoofs dawn was not
far off the wind was rising thickening
the lower air with dust dimming the stars
out on die desert nothing moved nor was
there any sound

   for the rest of that night and most of
the morning that came after it fraser sat
unmoving by the childs bed waiting for
her to wake

   she did it quietly one moment her face
was as it had been remote and secret and
in the next she had opened her eyes her
small body stirred and stretched she
yawned and then she looked at fraser very
solemnly but without surprise he smiled
and said hello

  she sat up a dark -and shaggy-haired
young person with eyes the color of topaz
and the customary look of premature age
and wisdom that the children of mars share
with the children of the earthly east she
asked hesitantly my mother-

   she had to go away for a while fraser
said and added with false assurance but
shell be back soon he was comforting
himself as much as the child

  she took even diat shred of hope from
him no she said she will not come
back she laid her head between her knees
and began to cry not making any fuss
about it fraser put his arm around her

  here he said here now dont do
that of course shell come back for you
shes your mother

   she cant

  but why why did she bring you here
mars minus bisha	

youre not sick you dont need a doctor
the child said simply they were going
to kill me

  fraser was silent for a long time then
he said ivba

  the thin shoulders quivered under his
arm they said i made the sickness that
was in our tribe the old men came all
together and they told my father and
mother i had to be killed the old men are
very powerful in magic but they said they
could not make me clean she broke off
choking over a sob my mother said it was
her right to do the thing and she took me
way off into the desert she cried she never
did that before i was frightened and then
she told me she wasnt going to hurt me
she was going to take me where i would
be safe she gave me some bitter water to
drink and told me not to be afraid she
talked to me until i went to sleep

  she looked up at fraser a frightened and
bewildered little girl and yet with a dignity
about her too

  my mother said our gods have cursed
me and i would never be safe with my own
people any more but she said earthmen
have different gods who wouldnt know me
she said you wouldnt kill me is that true
fraser said something under his breath
and then he told her yes thats true
your mother is a wise woman she brought
you to the right place his face had become
perfectly white he stepped back from the
bed and asked what s your name
bisha

  are you hungry bisha

  she hesitated still gulping down sobs
i dont know

  you think about it your clothes are
there-put them on ill fix some break-
fast

  he went out into the next room sick and
shaking with a rage such as he had never
experienced before superstition ignorance
the pious cruelty of the savage get an
epidemic going and when the magic of the
old man fails find a scapegoat call a
child accursed and send its own mother
out to slaughter it mentally fraser bowed
to the fierce-eyed woman who had been too
tough for those cowardly old men poor
devil only the certainty of death could

-planet-january

have made her abandon her child to an
earthman-a creature alien and unknown
but having different gods-

  why would they curse me asked
bisha close behind him our gods i
mean dressing was an easy proposition
for her with one thick garment to pull over
her head and sandals for her feet her
hair hung over her face and the tears still
dripped and now her nose was running
and fraser didnt know whether to laugh or
cry they didnt he said and picked her
up its only superstitious nonsense--

  he stopped that was not going to do
seven years a lifetime of training and be-
lief were not going to be wiped out by a
few words from a stranger he stood scowl-
ing trying hard to think of a way to reach
her and then he became aware that she was
looking at him with a childs intense and
wondering stare sitting quite stiffly in his
arms he asked are you afraid of me
i--ive never seen anyone like you be-
fore

  hm and youve never seen a house
like this one either

   she glanced around and shook her head
no its- she had no words for what
it was only a shiver of awe

  fraser smiled bisha you told me the
old men of your tribe were very powerful
in magic

   oh yes

   he set her down and took her hand firmly
in his im going to show you a few things
come on

   he didnt know whether child psycholo-
gists and other ethical persons would ap-
prove of his method but it was the only
one he could think of with the imposing
air of one performing wonders he intro-
duced the child of the nomad tents to the
miracles of modern gadgetry from running
water to recorded music and micro-books
as a climax he permitted her to peer in
through the door of the laboratory at the
mystic and glittering tangle of glass and
chrome and he asked her are your old
men greater in magic than i

  no she had drawn away from him
her hands clutched tightly around her as
though to avoid the accident of touching
anything behind her from the living quar-
ters wagners fire music still roared and


planet stories

rippled out of a tiny spool of wire sud-
denly bisha was down on her knees in an
attitude of complete submission you are
the greatest doctor in the world

   her word for doctor meant the same
as shaman fraser felt contrite and
ashamed it seemed a shabby trick to impress
a child but he stuck to it saying solemnly
very well bisha and now that that
is understood i tell you that curses have no
power in this place and i want no more
talk of them

   she listened not raising her head

   you are safe here you are not to be
afraid look up at me bisha do you prom-
ise not to be afraid

   she looked up he smiled and after a
little she smiled back i promise

   good he said and held out his hand
lets eat

about then it dawned on fraser that
he was saddled with a child for the
four and a half months that remained of
his term here he would have to feed look
after her and keep her hidden the people
of the town would hardly shelter her-
bishas mother hadnt trusted them cer-
tainly-and if they did the nomads would
only find her again when they came in for
the fall trading the only other alternative
was the central government at karappa
which would surely not condone ritual mur-
der but that was three hundred miles away
he had a trac-car but the work going for-
ward in the lab would not wait for him to
trundle a slow six hundred miles up and
down the desert he could not possibly
leave it

   four and a half months he looked down
at the small figure pattering beside him
and wondered what in the devil he was
going to do with her all that time

   at the end of a week he would have
been lost without her the awful loneliness
and isolation of the quonset was gone
there was another voice in the place an-
other presence somebody to sit across the
table from him somebody to talk to bisha
was no trouble she had been brought up
not to be a trouble in a hard school where
survival was the supreme lesson and that
same school had impressed on her young
mind the wisdom of making the best of

things she was no trouble at all she was
company the first he had had in nearly nine
months he liked her

   mostly she was cheerful and alert too
much engrossed in a new world of marvels
to brood about the past but she had her
moods fraser found her one afternoon
huddled in a corner dull and spiritless in
the depths of a depression that seemed
almost too deep for tears he thought he
knew what the trouble was he took her
on his lap and said are you lonesome
bisha

   she whispered yes

   he tried to talk to her it was like talk-
ing to a blank wall at last he said helpless-
ly try not to miss them too much bisha
i know im not the same as your own
family and this place is strange to you but
tr

   youre good she murmured i like
you it isnt that i was lonesome before
sometimes

   lonesome for what bisha

   i dont know just-lonesome

   queer little tyke thought fraser but
then most kids are queer to adult eyes
full of emotions so new and untried that
they dont know quite how to come out
and no wonder shes depressed in her
spot who wouldnt be

   he put her to bed early and then feel-
ing unusually tired after a long days work
he turned in himself

   he was awakened by bisha shaking him
sobbing calling his name leaden and half
dazed he started up in alarm asking her
what was the matter and she whimpered
i was afraid you didnt wake up

   what do you mean i didnt wake up
he sank back again weighted down with
the sleep he had not finished and began
to bawl her out then he happened to look
at the clock

   he had slept a trifle over fourteen hours
mechanically he patted bisha and begged
her pardon he tried to think and his
brain was wrapped in layers of cotton wool
dull lethargic he had had one drink before
going to bed not enough to put anyone out
for one hour let alone fourteen he had
not done anything physically exhausting
he had been tired but nothing the usual
eight hours wouldnt cure something was
mars minus bisha



wron and a small pinpoint of fear began
to prick him

  he asked how long have you been
trying to wake me

   she pointed to a chair that stood beside
the window when i began its shadow
was there now it is there

  as near as he could figure about two
hours not sleep then semi-coma the
pinprick became a knife blade

   bisha said so low that he could hardly
hear her it is the sickness that was in
our tribe i have brought it to you

   you might have at that fraser mut-
tered he had begun to shiver from the
onset of simple panic he was so far away
from help it would be so easy to die here
walled in by the endless miles of desert
the child had withdrawn herself from
him you see she said the curse has
followed me

   with an effort fraser got hold of him-
self it hasnt anything to do with curses
there arc people we call carriers- listen
bisha youve got to help me this sickness
-did any of your tribesmen die of it
no-

   fraser trembled even more violently this
time from sheer relief well then its
not so bad is it how does it-

  the old men said they would die
unless i was taken away and kiiled she
had retreated even farther now to the
other side of the room to the door sud-
denly she turned and ran

   it was a minute before frasers numbed
brain understood then he staggered up and
followed her out into the dust and the
cold light shouting her name he saw her
a tiny figure running between the blue-
black sky and the dull red desolation and
he ran too fighting the weakness and the
lassitude that were on him he seemed to
run for hours with the chill wind and the
dust and then he overtook her she strug-
gled begging to be let go and he smacked
her after that she was quiet he picked
her up and she wailed i dont want you
to die

   fraser looked out across the pitiless desert
and held her tight do you love me that
much bisha

   i have eaten your bread and your roof
has sheltered me- the old ceremonial

phrases learned from her elders sounded
odd in her young mouth but perfectly sin-
cere you are my family now my mother
and my father i dont want my curse to
fall on you

  for a moment fraser found it hard to
speak then he said gently bisha is your
wisdom greater than mine

   she shook her head

   is it your right to question it

  no

   what is your right bisha as a child
   to obey

you are never to do this again never
no matter what happens are you to run
away from me do you hear me bisha
she looked up at him youre not afraid
of the curse even now

   not now or any other time

  you want me to stay

   of course i do you poor wretched little
idiot

  she smiled gravely with the queer
dignity he had seen in her before you
are a very great doctor she said you
will find a way to lift the curse im not
afraid now

she lay warm and light in the circle of
his arms and he carried her back to
the quonset walking slowly talking all
the way it was odd talk in that time and
place it was about a far-off city called san
francisco and a white house on a cliff
that looked out over a great bay of blue
water it was about trees and birds and
fishes and green hills and all the things a
little girl could do among them and be
happy in the past few minutes fraser had
forgotten karappa and the authorities of
mars in the past few minutes he had
acquired a family

  back in the lab fraser began work he
questioned bisha about the sickness as she
had seen it in her tribe apparently the
seizures came at irregular intervals and in-
volved nothing more than the comatose
sleep but he gathered that the periods of
unconsciousness had been much shorter
often no more than a few minutes that
could be accounted for by acquired resist-
ance on the part of the martians bisha of
course had never had the sickness and
fraser imagined that the accident of natural


planet stories

immunity had caused her to be picked for
the tribal scapegoat

   his own symptoms were puzzling no
 temperature no pain no physical derange-
 ment only the lassitude and weakness and
 by next morning they had passed off he
 consulted his books on martian pathology
 there was nothing in them he ran a series
 of exhaustive tests even to a spinal tap on
 bisha which she took to be a very potent
 ritual of exorcism he would rather have
 done one on himself but that was impos-
 sible and there might be evidence in the
 child of some latent organism

   the test was negative all the tests were
 negative he and bisha both were as healthy
 as horses

   baffled but intensely relieved fraser be-
 gan to think of other explanations for the
 ailment it was not a disease so it must be
 a side-etfect of some physical condition
 perhaps the light gravitation or pressure or
 the thin atmosphere or all three that
 affected martians as well as earthmen but
 in a lesser degree he made a detailed
 report thrusting into the back of his mind
 as a small worry that no such side-effect
 had ever been observed before

   he waited nervously for a recurrence it
 didn t come and as the work in the lab
 demanded more and more of his attention
 he began to forget about it the time that
 he woke up in his chair with an untasted
 drink beside him and no memory of having
 gone to sleep he put down resolutely to
 weariness and overwork bisha had retired
 with another fit of the blues so she knew
 nothing about that and he didnt mention
 it she seemed to be getting over the curse
 fixation and he wanted to keep it that way

   more time went by bisha was learning
 english and she could name all the trees
 that stood around that house in san fran-
 cisco the confinement in the small hut
 was getting them both down and she was
 as anxious to leave as fraser but apart
 from that everything was going well

   and then the nomads came in from the
 desert for the fall trading

   fraser barred the doors and drew the
 blinds for the three days and nights of the
 trading he and bisha hid inside with the
 distant sound of the pipes and the shouting
 coming to them muffled but poignant the

 music and the voices of bishas own people
 her own family among the tribes they
 were hard days at the end of them bisha
 retired again into the remoteness of her
 private grief and fraser let her alone on
 the fourth morning the nomads were gone

   fraser thanked whatever gods there were
 weary and dragged out he went into the
 lab hating the work now because it took
 so much out of him anxious to have it
 finished he started across the room to
 open the blind-

   he was lying on the floor the lights
 were on and it was night bisha was beside
 him she seemed to have been there a long
 time his arm ached there were clumsy
 wrappings on it stained with blood shards
 of glass littered the end of the lab bench
 and the floor the familiar leaden numb-
 ness pervaded his whole body it was hard
 to move hard to think bisha crept to him
 and laid her head on his chest silently like
 a dog

   very slowly frasers head cleared and
 thoughts came into it  must have fallen
 across the bench good god what if i had
 broken the virus cultures not only us the
 whole town- i might have bled to death
 ami what would happen to bisha suppose
 i did die what would happen to her

   it took longer this time to return to
 normal he stitched up the cuts in his arm
 and the job was not neat he was afraid
 he was afraid to leave his chair afraid to
 smoke afraid to operate the stove the
 hours crawled by the rest of the night an-
 other day another evening he felt better
 but fear had grown into desperation he
 had only bishas word that this illness was
 not fatal he began to distrust his own
 tests postulating alien organisms unrecog-
 nizable to the medical science he knew
 he was afraid for himself he was terrified
 for bisha

   he said abruptly i am going into the
 town

   then i will come with you

   no youll stay right here ill be all
 right there is a doctor in the town a
 martian healer he may know-

   fie went out into the bitter darkness and
 tie blazing of the stars it seemed a lone
 way to the town

   he passed the irrigated land stripped
mars minus bisha



 of its harvest and came into the narrow
 streets the town was not old as they go
 on mars but the mud brick of the walls
 had been patched and patched again fight-
 ing a losing battle with the dry wind and
 the scouring dust there were few people
 abroad they looked at fraser and passed
 him by swarthy folk hot-eyed and per-
 petually desperate the canal was their god
 their mother and their father their child
 and their wife out of its dark channel they
 drew life painfully drop by drop they
 did not remember who had cut it all the
 long miles from the polar cap across the
 dead sea-bottoms across the deserts and
 through the tunnels underneath the hills
 they only knew that it was there and that
 it was better for a man to sin the foulest
 sin than to neglect the duty that was on him
 to keep the channel clear a cruel life and
 yet they lived it and were content

  there were no torches to light the streets
but fraser knew the house he wanted the
door of corroded metal opened reluctantly
to his knock and closed swiftly behind him
the room was small lit by a smoky lamp
and barely warmed by a fire of roots but
on the walls there were tapestries of incal-
culable age and incredible value

tor-esh the man of healing did well
at his trade his robe was threadbare
but his belly protruded and his chops were
plump unusual things among his lean
people he was fetish-priest oracle and
physician and he was the only man of the
town who had shown any interest in fraser
and his work it was not necessarily a
friendly interest he gave fraser the tradi-
tional greeting and fraser said stiffly

  i need your help i have contracted an
illness-

  tor-esh listened his eyes were shrewd
and penetrating and the smile that was
habitually on his face left them untouched
as fraser talked even that pretense of a
smile went gradually away

  when he was finished tor-esh said
again more slowly please your martian
is not always clear

  but do you know what it is can you
tell me-

  tor-esh said again

  fraser repeated the things he had said

trying not to show the fear that was in him
tor-esh asked questions accurate questions
fraser answered them for a little bit tor-
esh was silent heavy-faced and grim in the
flickering light and fraser waited with his
heart pounding in his throat

   tor-esh said slowly you are not ill
but unless a certain tiling is done you will
surely die

  fraser spoke in anger talk sense a
healthy man doesnt fall off his feet a
healthy man doesnt die except by acci-
dent

   in some ways said tor-esh very soft-
ly we are an ignorant people it is not
because we have not learned it is because
we have forgotten

   im sorry i didnt mean- look i came
to you for help this is something i dont
understand something i cant cope with

  yes tor-esh moved to the window
dark in the thickness of the wall have
you thought of the canal not only this one
but the many canals that bind mars in a
great net have you thought how they must
have been built the machines the tremen-
dous power that would have been needed
to make a dying world live yet a little
longer we are the children of the men
who conceived and built them and yet
nothing is left to us but the end product
of their work and we must grub with our
hands in the channel digging out the blown
sand

   i know said fraser impatiently ive
studied martian history but what-

  many centuries said tor-esh as
though he had not heard nations and
empires wars and pestilences and kings
beyond the counting learning science
growth and splendor and weariness and
decay oceans have rolled away into dust
the mountains have fallen down and the
sources of power are used up can you
conceive you who come from a young
world how many races have evolved on
mars

  he turned to face the earthman you
have come with your thundering ships your
machines and your science giving the lie
to our gods who we thought had created
no other men but us you look upon us as
degraded and without knowledge-and
yet you too are an ignorant people not be-


planet stories

cause you have forgotten but because you
have not yet learned there are many sci-
ences many kinds of knowledge there
have been races on mars who could build
the canals there were others who could see
without eyes and hear without ears who
could control the elements and cause men
to live or die as they willed it who were
so powerful that they were stamped out
because men feared them they are forgot-
ten now but their blood is still in us de-
struction of a people is never complete
we few who are left are blended into one
race but their blood is in us and some-
times a child is born-

   fraser stiffened

  tor-esh said quietly there was talk
among the nomads about a child

   nerves drawing tight in frasers belly
fear-nerves and a chill sweat i never men-
tioned bisha how could he know-

   im not interested in folk lore just tell
me-

   there was a certain evil in the tribe
when the child was taken away the evil
departed now it is in your house it seems
that the mother lied the child is not dead
she is with you

   witchcraft and sorcery fraser snarled
curses and cowardice i thought you knew
better tor-esh he started for the door
i was a fool to come here

  tor-esh moved swiftly and placed his
hand on the latch that it might not be
lifted until he was through

   we are ignorant folk but still we do
not kill children because we find pleasure
in it as for witchcraft and sorcery-words
are words only facts have meaning if you
wish to die that is your affair but when
you are dead the child must come into the
town-and that is our affair i will send
word to the nomads the girl is theirs and
the duty belongs to them we do not wish
it but until they come i will set a wall
around your house you are likely to die
quite soon there were twenty in her tribe
to share the curse but you are alone and
we can take no chances

   seeing perhaps the absolute horror in
frasers face tor-esh added it will be
done mercifully we bear the child no
hate

   he lifted the latch and fraser went into

the narrow street he turned toward the
desert and when he had crossed the
ploughed land he began to run he ran
fast but a rider passed him speeding into
the desert on the track of the caravan

  bisha was waiting for him sleepily anx-
ious he said you know where the food
is pack as much as you can in the trac-car
blankets too hurry up were leaving

he went into the laboratory in violent
haste but with the utmost care he
destroyed the work of months tempted as
he did so to forget ethics and scatter his
virus cultures broadcast into the town evil
superstition legendary warlocks tales of
mighty wizards he had read some of the
old imaginative stories written before space
flight in which ruthless earthmen were
pictured trampling innocent mars under
their feet logic and logistics both had made
that impossible when it came to the un-
romantic reality and he was almost sorry he
would have liked to trample some martians
under his feet

  when the laboratory was cleansed he
threw his notes together in a steel box and
took them into the dust-tight shed at the
back of the quonset where the trac-car was
housed bisha tear-streaked and silent had
been patiently lugging supplies he checked
them rapidly added a few more and swung
the child up into the cab she looked at
him and he realized then that she was
frightened dont worry he told her
were going to be all right

  youre not taking me back

  he said savagely im taking you to the
terran consulate at karappa and after that
im taking you to san francisco and no-
body had better try to stop me

  he flung open the shed door and climbed
in beside her the trac-car rolled out clank-
ing across the sand and already there were
lines of torches streaming out from the
town flung across his way

  he said crouch down on the floor
bisha and stay there you wont get hurt
he poured on the power the trac-car
lurched forward snorting and raising a
great cloud of dust he headed it straight
for the wavering line of torches ducking
his head instinctively so that he was pressed
close to the wheel the cab was metal and
mars minus bisha	

the glass parts of it were theoretically un-
breakable but he could see now in the
torchlight the bright metal throwing-sticks
of the townsmen the swift boomerangs that
could take off a mans head as neatly as a
knife blade he ducked

  something hit the window beside him
starring it with a million cracks other
things whacked and rattled viciously against
the car the torches fell away from in
front of him taking with them the dark
startled faces of the men who held them
he was through the line the open desert
was before him three hundred miles
karappa and civilization

   if he could beat the nomads

   he had better beat them it was his neck
as well as bishas he needed care he
needed it fast from somebody who did not
believe in curses

  dawn came cold in a dark sky veiled
in dust there was no canal between them
and karappa no town nothing but the
fine dry sand that flowed like water under
the wind

   look here he said to bisha if i
should suddenly fall asleep- he showed
her how to stop the trac-car at once
bisha and stay inside the cab until i wake
again she nodded her lips pressed tight
with the effort of concentration he made
her do it several times until he was sure
she would not forget

   the miles flowed out before and behind
to left and to right featureless unbroken
how long would it take a single rider to
catch a laden caravan how long for the
desert men on their fleet beasts to find a
trail the sand was soft and the clanking
treads sank in it and no matter how much
you wanted to hurry you could go no faster
than the desert would let you

   bisha had been thinking hard suddenly
she said they will follow us

  she was smart too smart for her own
good fraser said the nomads we can
beat them anyway theyll soon give up

  no theyll follow not you but me
and they will kill us both

   fraser said were going to eardi the
men of mars and the gods of mars cant
reach there

  they are very powerful gods- are you
sure

  very sure youll be happy on earth
bisha

   she sat close to him and after a while
she slept there was a compass on the dash
a necessity in that place of no roads and
no landmarks fraser kept the needle cen-
tered setting a course as though with a
ship i ime and the sand rolled on and he
was tired

   tired

   you are likely to die quite soon-there
were twenty in her tribe to share the curse-

rjlhe desert whispered the sounds of
-l the trac-car were accepted and forgotten
by the ear and beyond them the desert
whispered gliding sliding rippling under
the wind frasers vision blurred and wa-
vered he should not have pushed himself
so hard at the work tired no resistance
to the sickness that was why it had been
light among the hardy nomads more serious
in him an alien already worn down by
months of confinement and mental strain
that was why

  -twenty in her tribe to share it-but
you alone-

  three hundred miles isnt so far of
course you can make it youve made it in
an afternoon on earth

  this isnt earth and you didnt make
it in a cold creeping desert

  you alone-

  damn tor-esh

  bisha wake up we need some food
and first off i need that bottle

  with a drink and some food inside him
he felt better well keep on all night
by morning easy well be in karappa if
the nomads are following theyll never
catch up

  mid-afternoon and he was driving in
a daze he lost track of the compass when
he noticed it again he was miles off his
course he sat for some minutes trying to
remember the correct reading trembling
bisha watched him

   dont look so frightened he said his
voice rose im all right ill get us there
she hung her head and looked away from
him

  and dont cry damn it do you hear
ive got enough on my neck without you
being doleful


planet  f okies

   it is because of me she said you
should have believed the words of the old
men

   he struck her the first time he had ever
 laid his hand on her in anger i dont want
 any more of that talk if you havent learned
 better in all this time-

   she retreated to the other side of the
 seat he got the trac-car going again in
 the right direction but he did not go far
 he had to rest just an hours sleep would
 help he stopped he looked at bisha and
 like something that had happened years ago
 he remembered that he had slapped her

    poor little bisha he said and it isnt
 any of it your fault will you forgive me

   she nodded and he kissed her and she
 cried a little and then he went to sleep
 telling her to wake him when the hand on
 the dashboard clock reached five it was
 hard to rouse when the time came and
 it was full dark before the trac-car was
 lurching and bucking its way out of the
 sand that had drifted around it fraser
 was not refreshed he felt worse if any-
 thing sapped and drained his brain as
 empty as an upturned bucket

   he drove

   he was off his course again he must
have dozed and the car had made a circle
to the south he turned angrily to bisha and
said why didnt you stop the car i told
you-

   in the faint glow from the dashboard
he saw her face turned toward the desert
and he knew the look on it the withdrawal
and the sadness she did not answer fraser
swore of all the times to pick for a fit of
the blues when he needed her so badly
she had enough to make her moody but
it was getting to be a habit and she had no
right to indulge her emotions now she
had already cost them precious hours pre-
cious miles he reached out and shook her

   it was like shaking a rag doll he spoke
 to her sharply she seemed not to hear
 finally he stopped the car furious with her
 stubbornness and wrenched her around to
 face him for the second time he slapped
 her

   she did not weep she only whispered
i cant help it they used to punish me
 but i cant help it

   she didnt seem to care he couldnt

 touch her couldnt penetrate he had never
 tried to shake her out of these moods before
 now he found that lie could not he let
 her sink back into the corner and he
 looked at her and a slow corrosive terror
 began to creep through him because of
 the times before-the times that she had
 been like this

   the times immediately preceding the
 periods of blackness the abnormal sleep

   a pattern every time the same unvaried
 pattern

   but it made no sense it was only coin-
 cidence

   coincidence three times repeated and
 how had tor-esh known so certainly that
 the child was with him

   three times the pattern if it happened
 a fourth time it could not be coincidence
 if it happened a fourth time he would
 know

   could he afford a fourth time

   crazy how could a childs moods affect
 a man

   he grabbed her again a desperation
 came over him he treated her roughly
 more roughly than he could ever have
 dreamed of treating a child and it did no
 good she looked at him with remote eyes
 and bore it without protest without inter-
 est

   not a mood then something else

   what

   sometimes a child is born-

 fraser sent the trac-car rushing for-
 ward along the beam from its head-
 lights a bright gash in the immemorial
 dark

  he was afraid he was afraid of
bisha and still he would not believe

   get to karappa theres help there
 whatever it is therell be somebody to know
 the truth to do something keep awake
 dont let the curtain fall again

   think we know it isnt a curse thats
 out we know it isnt a disease we know
 it isnt side-effects theyd have been ob-
 served besides tor-esh understood

   what was it he said about old races
 what did they teach us about them in the
 colleges too much and not enough too
 many races and not enough time

   they could see without eyes and hear
mars minus bisha



without ears they could control the ele-
ments-

  he tried to remember and it was a pain
and a torment he looked at the child old
races recessive genes still cropping out
but whats the answer esp is known among
the martians but this isnt esp what
then

  a remnant a scrap of something twisted
out of shape and incomplete

  what is she so lonesome for that she
doesnt know

  the answer came to him suddenly clear
as the ringing of a bell a page from a
forgotten text book hoarded all these years
in his subconscious a casual mention of a
people who had tried to sublimate the con-
ditions of a dying world by establishing a
kind of mental symbiosis living in a tight
community sharing each others minds and
their potentials and who had succeeded
in acquiring by their mass effort such pow-
ers of mental control that for several cen-
turies they had ruled this whole quadrant
of mars leaving behind them a host of
legends

  and a child

  a child normal and healthy in every
way but one her brain was incomplete
designed by a cruel trick of heredity to be
one of a community of inter-dependent
minds that no longer existed like a battery
it discharged its electrical energy in the
normal process of thinking and living and
like a run-down battery it must be charged
again from outside because its own regen-
erative faculty was lacking and so it stole
from the unsuspecting minds around it an
innocent vampire draining them whenever
it felt the need

  it was draining his now there had
been twenty in her tribe and so none of
them had died as yet but he was alone
and that was why the intervals had short-
ened because he could no longer satisfy
her need

  and the martians in their ignorance were
right and he in his wisdom had been
wrong

  if he put her out now and left her in
the desert he would be safe

  he stopped the car and looked at her
she was so little and helpless and he had
come to love her it wasnt her fault some-
thing might still be done for her a way
might be found and in a city she would
not be so deadly

  could he survive another plunge into
the darkness

  he didnt know but she had run away
once of her own accord for his sake he
could do no less than try

  he took her into his arms

  the curtain dropped

  fraser woke slowly in brazen sunshine
and a great silence as one creeping back
from the edge of an abyss he woke and
the car was very still there was no one
in it with him he called but there was
no answer

  he got out of the car he walked call-
ing and then he saw the tracks the tracks
of the nomads beasts coming toward the
car from behind the small tracks of bishas
feet going back to meet them

  he stopped calling the sound of his
voice was too loud too terrible he began
to run back along that trail it ended in
a little huddle of clothing that had no life
in it

  she had broken her promise to him she
had disobeyed and left him asleep and safe
to meet the riders by herself the riders who
were following her not him

  so small a grave did not take long to
dig

  fraser drove on there was no more
danger now but he drove fast seeing the
desert in a blur wanting never to see it
again wanting only earth-but not a white
house there that for him would be forever
haunted

chas a stopher

 probos five gazed at the white ex-
 panse ahead trying to determine where
 his ship would crash something was
 haywire in the fuel system of his interstar
 runabout he was losing altitude fast so
 fast that all five pairs of his eyes couldnt
 focus on a place to land

   five pairs of arms each pair about three
 feet apart on the loglike body pushed but-
 tons and rotated controls frantically but
 to no avail in a few short minutes it would
 all be over for probos five even if by some
 miracle he remained unhurt after crashing
 lie would die shortly thereafter the frigid
 climatic conditions of the third planet were
 deadly to a mercurian he thought once of
 donning his space suit but decided against
 t that would merely prolong the agony
 from planet three when one has a smashed
 space cruiser there is no return probos five
 knew that death was riding with him in the
 helpless ship the situation did not unneces-
 sarily dismay him mercuriarts are philoso-
 phers

   probos five ceased to manipulate the un-
 responding controls stretching his trunk
 like torso to its full twenty feet four heads
 gazed through observation ports at the four
 points of the compass while the remaining
 head desultorily watched the instrument
 panel

   since die he must probos five would
 meet his end stoically and five pairs of
 stumpy arms folded over five chests in a co-
 ordinated gesture of resignation

   probos five thought fleetingly of his wife
 lingua four and remembered with some an-
 noyance that she was the author of his pres-
 ent predicament a social climber probos
 five thought to himself but aside from that
 a good wife and mother in addition to being
 a reigning beauty lingua four was tall even
 for a mercurian already she scaled seven
 dergs or in earth terms fourteen feet and
 was beginning to show evidences of a fifth
 

totem poles are a dime a dozen north
of    but only ketch ihe lying
eskimo vowed they dropped out of
frigid northern skies

head five heads were rarely found on
females and probos five was justly proud
of his good fortune in all mercury at the
present time he knew of but two females
possessing five heads and soon lingua four
would be the third of her sex to be thus
endowed

    yes thought probos five a woman
to be proud of for today after three vargs
of marriage the memory of her trim trunk
with four pairs of eyes laughing mischiev-
ously filled his five brains with flame slim
as a birch she stood in his memory and
eight eyes whispered lovers thoughts across
space and time

   probos five recalled his five minds from
 their nostalgic reverie and gazed at the con-
 tour of the earth that was rushing up to
 meet him white blazing white reflecting
 the rays of the midnight sun covered the
 region as far as the eye could reach

   good thought probos five the polar
 regions that means the end will come
 quickly one or two seconds at the most of
 that bitter cold would be enough

ftilrning away from the windows pro-
-l bos five let his thoughts return to lingua
four to probos iwo his son and his home
on the first planet from the sun ah that
is the place to live thought probos the
temperature an unchanging  just com-
fortably warm where one could enjoy a
life of warmth and ease too bad that he
would not live to see it again thirty vargs
he reflected is such a short time with luck
perhaps he may have lived to see a hundred
vargs slip by and perhaps in time he may
have added three more heads and five dergs
in length to his towering trunk

  he thought of probos two and wondered
idly if his son would also visit the barbarian
worlds to collect data for lingua four

he wished that he could have seen more
of probos i wo theres an up-and-coming
solar stiff



lad he thought not quite two vargs old and
two heads already yes indeed hes quite a
boy probos five remembered proudly may-
be his mother will keep him at home instead
of running him all over the universe to get-
material for her committees

  he wished that lingua four would settle
down and be content as a housewife but he
doubted that she would social ambition was
boring like a termite under her bark

  lingua four was determined to be the
first lady of arbor the capital city of mer-
cury to this end lingua four had labored
unceasingly she was president of half the
womens clubs of arbor she could always
be depended upon to furnish the best in new
and diverting subjects

  she headed almost all committees for aid
or research on any type of problem it was
owing to lingua four being president of
the committee for undernourished arbor-
ians that probos five was making this ill-
starred trip his purpose was to capture a
few of the upright divided trunk animals
that inhabited the third planet

  they were to be transported to mercury
and given over to scientific study as to their
edible qualities if it were found that the
divided trunk creatures were fit for mercu-
rian consumption the problem of under-
nourishment would no longer exist since the
supply of divided trunks was seemingly in-
exhaustible mercurians had made expedi-
tions to the third planet before and every
report concluded with - divided trunk
creatures increasing in number

  privately probos five doubted the pos-
sibility of using the divided trunks for food
since the last expedition once again reported
a complete lack of captives due to the frail
and tenuous bodies of the divided trunks
then too transportation and preservation
opposed a tremendous problem not to men-
tion the difficulty of trying to eat something
that might vaporize on your fork but then
these questions may never arise he decided
for of all the reports perused by probos
five not one expedition had succeeded in
bringing a divided trunk to mercury

   all reports were read to the last letter by
probos five before assembling equipment
for his own trip in the reports he had noted
many of the difficulties of the earlier mis-
sions planet three was impossible for a

mercurian without a heated space suit the
temperature of planet three was so low that
it would literally freeze a mercurian stiff in
a matter of seconds

  the casualties of the early expeditions
had been numerous many mercurians had
succumbed to the bitter cold due to flaws
in space suits and other accidents a break
in the suit meant instant death the victims
of such mishaps were invariably buried in
the isolated sparsely inhabited polar regions
to avoid alarming the divided trunk crea-
tures

  it was strange mused probos five that
the divided trunks were seemingly unable
to bear the slightest increase in tempera-
ture their bodies disintegrated upon con-
tact with a mercurian some were roped and
dragged from a distance up to the doors of
the space ships but no inhabitant of planet
three had been closer to mercury than the
air lock of the space cruisers as the divided
trunk people were dragged into the air lock
warm air from the ship would be pumped
into the lock to dispel the frigid air of
planet three as the warmth of mercury
enveloped the divided trunks they became
quite red began to melt and finally dis-
solved into a gaseous state leaving a small
pile of ashes and a disagreeable odor in the
air lock that sometimes lingered for days

  probos five believed he had the solution
for these obstacles in the path of scientific
study of the divided trunks he had decided
to use guile in place of strength for this
reason he had come alone and in a small
space runabout to put his solution to the
test but his solution now could never be
tried he remembered morosely

in the aft compartment probos five had
constructed a refrigeration plant by
maintaining a constant degree of frigidity
he hoped to deliver a pair of each species of
divided trunks to mercury he hoped espe-
cially to capture a complete set and perhaps
a few over to make up for breakage and
losses as to what form of sustenance the
divided trunks were accustomed to he had
no idea whatsoever he had intended to
bring samples of earth vegetation and any-
thing else that may have suggested a source
of food for the divided trunks

  the thought too had occurred to him that


planet stories

    possibly the divided trunk creatures ate one
    another on the possibility of this probos
    five had determined to capture three black
    ones three white enes three yellows three
    browns and three reds and three of any
    other color that he might find he rather
    doubted that more colors or combina-
    tion of colors existed all previous expedi-
    tion reports had mentioned only the five
    colors however probos five had deter-
    mined to keep several eyes open on the off
    chance that he might find a new and dif-
    ferent species

      his refrigerator was modeled along the
    architectural lines of the dens of the divided
    trunks the main room of the refrigerator
    opened to the outside of the ship by means
    of a small air lode a mcrcurian size air
    lock was not needed for the divided trunks
    as few had been found to be much over
    three dergs in height

      winches and cables to pull the divided
    trunks into the refrigerator were installed
    in the refrigerator room itself to avoid
    burning the divided trunks with hot cables
    from other parts of the ship

      in addition probos five had cunningly
     devised a refrigerated trap this too was
    designed to simulate the caves of the divided
    trunk creatures but was smaller it was con-
    r structed with entrances readily seen and
    exits well hidden probos five had expected
    great things of his trap he had conceived
    the idea after reading the report of a mer-
    curian expedition that explored the dens of
    the divided trunks at some place marked

  i	coney island according to the reports

the divided trunks showed no hesitancy in
entering these types of dens in fact the
writer of the report gave it as his opinion
that the divided ones perhaps played games
in these types of caves it also mentioned
that some of the dens were equipped with
flat shiny surfaces that cast reflections or
images probos five had incorporated the
image making surfaces into his trap design
a pity that all this effort must be wasted
thought probos as he once more turned to
the observation ports to check his remaining
distance from the planets surface seeing
that his time was short probos five turned
all five faces forward in the mercurian ges-
ture of disdain for death a moment later
came the shock

  a week later the proprietor of a novelty
shop in fairbanks watched two natives with
their dogteam pulling something loglike
through the snow toward the trading post
turning to a customer he remarked

  here comes ketch and ah koo dragging
in another totem pole guess that ketch
must be the biggest liar ever produced by
the eskimos he tried to tell me that totem
poles fall from the sky says he can always
find one if he sees it fall because its so hot
it melts the snow around it personally i
think he should be elected president of the
liars club but ill buy the totem pole
anyway those pesky tourists always whittle
a chunk out of my totem pole for a
souvenir

  im glad hes bringing me another one
the storekeeper concluded the one he sold
me last year is about whittled away

dc-ar editor

  you may start reading here

  seems funny when a fan realizes the different 
cults that exist in stf-dom whod suppose that such
devotion could survive over the prime object of one
solitary pulp mag but i can see that several fans
agree with me and my unspoken feelings

  you see back in the grand old year of  when
fans were fans and proud of the fact i discovered
my first planet since then theyve multiplied
into a whole solar system

  as for this club-or cult-ive come to the con-
clusion that it consists of all of the fans who entered
stf through a copy of planet and have remained
faithful over the years whereas the same thing
happens in the case of other mags a person who
read amazing first will probably remain true to
amazing or the fan in question might buy other
mags but to him the first one will always be the
best

  thus is planet to me im a firm member of
the planet cult and as my membership is slight-
ly past the freshman stage i uphold my rights the
rights of every planet loving fan  

 planet must not be changed

  these new digest mags attract most of the old
writers all right with their higher rates but
planet has her name writers too however when
they appear in planet its because theyre writing
for the love of it not for the cash or leastways
their agent has a soft spot in his heart and realizes
that a good story would be more appreciated in
planet than anywhere else

  in the sept issue leigh brackett was up to her
usual standard with a good story the ark of
mars

  and after this letter sees print and the fans vote
it as number one in vizi-you can send me the
illo by wood in the sept issue you should buy
more of his work his illos prove that he puts out
a heck of a lot of work on each one nice

dear editor

  waiting for a streetcar the other day i happened
to glance at the magazine stand situated at the car
stop what i saw there caused a state of shock
i wasnt released from it until i had bought the
sept issue of planet stories and stared at the
cover for a full ten minutes for the first time in the
seven years ive been reading s-f i saw it it
meaning a girl on the cover of an s-f magazine
wearing a space suit in space

  now it isnt that im against half-nude gals on
covers but im a firm believer in the equality of the
sexes if men have to wear space suits women
should too also i doubt tiiat anyone buys your
magazine for the pin-up value of its covers

  besides i believe i enjoy the covers much more
than anyone why because of a simple optical
device that i use its by removing the lenses from
the viewers used for -d movies and replacing one
with a transparent piece of blue plastic and the
other with red plastic try it when looking at a
picture it gives the illusion of depth

  however they do not work for black and white
illustrations im still working on that

and now for my worthless opinions on the stories

  where sex met space-now theres a story
i really enjoyed for a changc the female was frus-
trated instead of the male

  bunzo farewell was well written however
the human-being-infant-spider-food is being overused
these days

  preview of peril was a good yarn though
someones bound to yell space-opera

  the rest arent worth mention except the ark
of mars that was particularly putrid

my dear ed

  i cant stand it  how obvious can you get and
still face yourself in a mirror its really something
when authors must resort to disgustingly obvious
pen names such as spelling their own name back-
wards as derfla leppoc did in the new vortex sf
mag and somebody who really came up with a
dilly in the sept ish-sol galaxan great ghu
and all his little ghuls youd think that with
enough imagination to write the story in the first

fiace the guy could come up with something much
ivelier such as john jones no doubt

  leigh bracketts compelling space-opc-ra was thor-
oughly enchanting from the descriptions of the dead
martian cities and ancient landscapes to the emptiness
of the silent void this took all honors by a wide
margin

 next was the unreconstructed wom-
an an odd little tale made other-worldly by the
different writing technique it alone would have
made the mag worth buying not to mention brac-
kett

  the others are the kind you read once rate casu-
ally to yourself from disinterest to passable enjoy-
ment and promptly forget after all it does take
some crud to really appreciate the classic gems

few precious paragraphs for the results well
well sooq know if he did or not anyway

  finally managed to drag  lists out of as many

to read the contents of various prozines they listed
their  favorite stf mags in order of preference
however  are hardly the majority of readers of
even one state let alone the whole country and

help out

dear editor

  if your authors have to use pen names dont
make them as obvious as sol galaxan this is a
very lousy type of a pen name if sol galaxan isnt
a pen name i feel sorry for the person to whom it

belongs

  leigh brackett usually writes good stories and
the ark of mars was no exception the plot
was good because it was plausible leigh should do
a iequel to it based on the problems of life on the
new world this is of course providing she can
find s plot that hasnt been used a couple of hundred
times

  preview of peril and miss tweedhams
elogarsn were the only good short stories cut
down on the short stories and have longer and more
novels and novelets

  i agree with carol mckinney on the subject of
planet having longer editorials letters calvin

  for shame on you you sneaked up on me has
pianet secretly gone monthly it doesnt seem
like two months since the last issue well all for
the better

  bless your heart to top off an already good issue
vou give us leigh brackett planet stories is
back in its stride now brackett hadi returned need
i say that she had a dam good story doesnt she

always

  j w groves slipped in die no  slot hooray
for sex

stories

  only story i really didnt care much for was
r m williams litde tiling so she was a call
girl but she tore up her teachers certificate the
martians werent in the least frightening were they
supposed to be

  the sept planet is about the best this year

  now to the heart of the matter the vizigraph
may it live long

  agreed with practically everything calvin beck
had to say okay jack why dont you try some fan
features it would sell more copies

  why do people keep picking on bryan berry
i liked him the old meanics

  now fredrick b christoffs letter i liked because
he agrees with i mostly also hes a friend

  flying saucers still from a fem fan id better
keep my mouth shut i suppose

  mittelbuschers letter was interesting one thing
tho-please do not trim the blankety
blankety edges thats all you hear these
days trimmed edges i cant see where trimmed
edges make one bit of difference in the story quality

  h-mra i see the flaw in my argument tho if
the edges make no difference in the story quality
they do make a nicer looking mag all rite so im
wrong i take it all back

  mr ed i didnt care for your note at the end of
carol mckinneys letter so you are going to refuse
to have any fan interest columns why not put it
to a vote thats the fair way of doing things if
you showed the publisher the outcome im sure
they wouldnt raise hell about it come on be
a sport in case you decide to i vote for diem

  why do people like hen keep complaining
about the femmes on the cover no sense of humor
thats all

  why doesnt russell brown get in touch with
ray palmer about his flying saucers or better yet
write an article for whispering space ha 
sneaked in an ad i hope

  im sure if paul miller would only read the back
cover he would find it very useful highly interest-
ing you can read that small print and feel touched
by something bigger than yourself what

  gee whil gosh wow a mother nature type-
writer in the letter column aw come on evelyn
let us poor fans be critics let us have our fun
after all we cant be cultured and flourishing like
unto you

greetings and halucinations

  may i be permitted to utter that well known
phrase what no bems not only is there
no bems but the cover illustrates a scene from
taoms this will never do sir you had better
be careful or be making with a new editor that
cover was well done and proves that an alien can
look very attractive in a space suit but who did the
painting hmmmmm why not give die cover artist
a credit line on the contents page

  i take it you wrote the flight of the
eagle because only an editor could think up such
a pen name as sol galaxan i suggest that you blurb
all future stories as being written by me thus you
and other writers would not have to think up such
lousy pen names

  i have read complaints that you use comic book
illustrators you do too cause wood is a staff
artist of ec pubs and illustrates stories for theif
the vizigraph	

stf comics even so i cannot see that anyone could
object to the illo by wood on page  a well
filled out illo no

    cant find any lousy stories thish so rate them
as follows  the ark of mars  the
unreconstructed woman  bunzo
farewell  miss tweedhams elo-
garsn and  where sex met space in-
teresting story that bunzo farewell but they
better bury that plot soon for its beginning to
smell unlike a rose one more thing on bf-the
build-up to the climax was basically stf but the
climax falls into the horror class of story this is
the type of story the stf comics rely upon and
i was just wondering if its good for ps or is sauce
for the gander gesse for the goose or something
to that effect

    i see that mittelbuscher is the proud possessor
of a cranium vacuum i wonder how he and
other fen would like it if i and several others spent
our spare time writing letters to la vizi and if you
printed everyone i wrote it would simplify the
awarding of pics wouldnt it i have time to write
several letters to all the prozines but i prefer to
write only one and take my chances with the rest
of the fen i agree with paiol on not changing ps
ps is basically the same as when it came out 
years ago same messy covers same lousy stories
and same fermenting vizi why change after all
these years besides ps must live up to the saying
that everything in stf changes but planet

evelyn mclean seems to think that we fen should
not have the right to express our opinions on stories
and illos hmmmm fen that write letters are usually
intelligent they offer honest opinions on illos and
stories the editor if he pays attention can pretty
well judge what type of story goes over well and
try to obtain the type of story the fen want in
doing this he keeps them happy and buying his
respective zine how could he do this if no opinions
were expressed evelyn states she is tired of our
opinions and then offers hers on space battles and
gruesome animals hmmmm miss mclean allez

dear editor

  thursday night i put on my trench coat dark
hat equally dark gloves and stepped out into the
fog of berkeley the street was empty save for a
drunk leaning against the lamppost reading a copy
of galaxy

  yes no one was about so i quickened my pace
in the direction of the local newsstand i rounded
the corner and saw like a beacon bringing home
some wandering soul the neon sign over the drug
store

   as i turned into the store i pulled up my collar
to cover my face and pulled down my hat then
picking up the september issue of planet 
slithered up to druggist

   twenty-five cents says he

   i plunked down a piece of united states currency
on the counter and started out it was then that i
was amazed by die cover no bems no naked
girls out in space without space suits and what
more i found out later it illustrated the story

  i was almost tempted to take off my disguijc
and let the man behind the counter recognize me
but no i said im a respectable teen ager and
wouldnt be caught dead with an issue of planet

   that is definitely not the way i buy my science
fiction i am not afraid to be seen by the respectable
citizens of this town with an issue of planet in
my hands people who criticize stf for lurid so
they say covers should be berled in erl but let
these same individuals be criticized for possession
of a nationally known magazine with a young lady
wrapped in about three inches of gauze they flip
their lid

  you could go out to the public beach and see
the same display minus of course space ships and
bems so why should they condemn science fiction
magazines for their covers

   a good question say i   

  now on to the september issue number -the
ark of mars naturally the rest werent worth
commenting about in the presence of that novel

  i have been reading about bb in the vizi-
graph joe blow oops sorry joe keogh and a
score of others seem to think that bb has been
using ray bradburys style of writing so what
bradbury didnt originate that style so why cremate
the poor guy because he likes rbs type of writing
and decides to use it

   i rest my case

sincerely

don wegars

all problems here please

 glenridge ave

st catharines ont

zear sir

  issue after issue the vizigraph has been get-
ting more intelligent to read after all we have to
admit were growing up even in the space-opera
class and can no longer find it in us to enjoy column
after column of variegated trash the only difference
in it being that one writer had a preference for rows
of exclamation marks or uncapitalized words

   but even in this day of renovated wordage there
still lurks one last anachronistic system-the voting
arrangement for deciding which letter wins an illo
all of us have to admit that at one time or another
weve had doubts as to how fairly the balloting is
arranged
	planet

  la simple terms the choice rests with the choice
few who send in letters sometimes even they neglect
to exercise their franchise the net result being that
in this democratic continent a clique of ten to fifteen
fen who have had their letters printed plus i dont
know how many fen who didnt control the election
exclusively

  another perplexing thing is that fen wont take the
trouble to write in wasting both money and energy
so that someone else can win a prize and i dont
blame them at the most they include their selection
ia a letter of their own becoming another member
of the clique

  we have the problem so how can we find a fair
solution i dont know how many times i have
thought that the arranging of the letters has a great
deal to do with the choice too you may not have
any real vote jack but you do have a lot of power
when it comes to electioneering

  many readers say well jack must know the best
ones thats why he puts them there usually the
first three are the choicest too but still there are the
odd good ones circulating around through the rest
of la vizi the back page is left for the neophytes
and fanatics

  my solution to the problem is not to mix the
letters up because if the editor wants to arrange
them in order of readability it makes it that much
easier for us readers to pick out the crud however
if you want the average reader to take time to vote
youll have to bribe him as it were with the bait
of egoboo    who can resist that

  it wouldnt hurt the vizigraph at all to have
 few letters deleted and in a couple of columns
give the readers names and home cities addresses
might take up too much room and the three per-
sons they voted for excluding the letter-writers of
that issue of course who have already outlined their
preferences

  readers and fen have been yelling for more
departments lately-why not give em that one it
would he truly a readers department yet it wouldnt
cost planet any more than paper space

   the list might be small at first only a few readers
and fen whose letters were left out but given time
it could grow into a good two columns it would
be interesting to both readers senders and letter-
writcrs alike to see just how many people voted
for whom

  naturally jack osullivan would laboriously com-
pile an aggregate total for the lazier of us perhaps
on the line of astoundingj story scoring system
but whatever way its done it would be of interest
to the reader to sec how many of his fellow readers
voted as he did

  would that be viwating the planet editorial
policy jack i also think the odd editorial or in-
formation piece would be welcome though not
mandatory we are all adult enough to know that
your well-stated editorial policy was more of a pub-
lishers policy since planet lias never indulged
if anything but fiction under any of its editors

  give the letters to these hacks in the order of
cal beck paul mittelbuscher if only in gratitude
and evelyn mclean

  i give the latter only in grudging admiration for
evelyn s letter was certainly written in a confident
and humble manner thats not as contradictory as
it seems and it made me think which is more
than a letter of pure criticism good or bad will
make me do

  evelyn would have so-called arm-chair critics who

stories

are not writers vent their rage on poison pen letters
only to burn them and inhale the smoke but she
forgets that each individual writer gives the reader
something to think about even if it is only what-
aconceitedslob he is

  authors and editors both like to get die audience
reaction and readers judge their literary awareness
by comparing it with the vizigraph if something
new comes up it provides food for thought in a
letter column discussion

  its the same in any mag readers like to vent off
steam editors gauge their reaction other readers see
and disagree write a letter in reply    quite stim-
ulating even if it doesnt get you anywhere so
thats why there are so many two-bit critics-re-
actions differ and there are some rare fen that are
capable of seeing a good story when there is one

  interior art work has picked up a bit and the
occasional use of emsh helps more than a little
let me say that this months front cover shows
planets quality is greatly improving just as the
late earle bergey improved through the years and
i assume it is an anderson job so has artist
anderson

  the lettering didnt in any way destroy the beauty
of the picture but actually enhanced it the block
style lettering looks quite neat and clear-cut when
before mr anderson gave all his efforts to creating
nothing but contrasting bold blobs of color he
has shown this time greater respect for the spec-
trum

  i advise him to stick to his present style employ-
ing a dark cover since he uses shadow painting a
great deal besides the ever present hero shooting
bem was absent a woxdiy detail the only hint of
anything firing was a man holding a repair welder
even the ever present girl was fully clad in space
suit although it was more form-fitting superbly
done i wont expect the next to be as mature and
as well-drawn as this because you already have a
stock in reserve but it forecasts a trend for planet
that should be cncouraged

  i suppose i could write two more letters about the
stories but id probably be censored again by the
fen only may i remind the more unfortunate ones
who werent in on the deal that i wasnt the only-
one that ish and i wrote on two different issues

  strangely enough and by the greatest of coinci-
dence all eleven letter-writers in this septembers
planet all started their masterful epistles out
with and i quote dear editor i was one of
them but   

   give fair warning if anyone sees me write to
jack osullivan boosting bryan berry praising rough
edges loving sloppy drawings and saying you-know-
who is the best editor since ben hibbs and
jwc   

yours till venus drys up

joe keogh

eds note andersons last cover design graced the
may issue kelly freas rendered the one you have
in mind joe and all others since as to the selection
of the best letters-the editor has been doing the
selecting for many years now duly influenced of
course by readers choices you overplay the mat-
ter when you use the term electoneering theres
nothing in it for me except to choose the most in-
teresting informative or critical letters and it is
oidy natural to place several of die better missives
not all of them mind you at the head of the
