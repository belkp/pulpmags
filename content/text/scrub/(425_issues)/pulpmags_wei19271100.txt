hour in a feu hours i learned
the secret of sketching

even as a boy i was fond of drawing
hundreds of other people feel the
same way i suppose but i always
had an ambition to sometime be-
come a commercjauartist

   i dont think it was altogether the big in-
comes that modern commercial artists re-
ceive which attracted me to this profession
as much as the fascination and interest of
the work itself and the independence of an
artists life

   although i had a fondness for drawing i
found it very difficult to sketch anything
accurately for example i could never get
a drawing to look anything like the person
it was supposed to represent i knew just
how i wanted the picture to look but
somehow  never could make my sketches
lifelike enough to suit me

how it all began

  then one evening just as i was getting
on the car on my way home from the office
someone gave me a slap on the back and
turning quickly i found myself looking
into the smiling face of jack keating

   we found a seat attheend of the car and
began telling what we had been doing in
the three years since we had last seen each
other

  suddenly jack stopped talking

  how can i describe my surprise when he
quickly slipped a lit-
tle book from his

pockrt and began to -

sketch an old man
with spectacles who
was reading a paper
at the far end of the
car as i watched

jackshaad flew rapid
ly and without a-
pause ovsr the little
sheet before him

  jack sketching i
couldnt kelp smiling
for when jack und i
were at school he
could hardly draw a
straight line

   but my smile faded

i was amazed for
out of his ijencil
strokes came a vtvid
little picture with
scarcely any detail
yet intensely alive ana
full of character i
looked up to find
jack smiling at my
amazement

  for the love of
mike jack  ex-
claimed since when
dia you become an artist

   jatk gave a few more touches to his little
sketch and then turned over the pages
his little book was almost full of clever
drawings similar in style to the one he had
just completed they were all sketches of
people alive with character and movement

   	i dont think i ever drew anything in
my life until a couple of years ago he said
but it is really astonishing how quickly
the hani and eye can be developed there

are only a few basic rules
which a fellow can get in a
few hours of real work-
then it is all a matter of
practice

  but how i asked
did you happen to find all
this out-and who taught
you

	it all began with an
advertisement i saw in a
magazine offering a book
about drawing i read
every word of that advertise-
merit twice over then i sentjor
the book

  i really couldnt help i
rupting jack here

  why i did just the e
thing yesterday i said 
go on jack

 but

illustrated book

now free

  well said jack a day or
so later i got the book it con-
vinced me pretty firmly that i
eould draw if i really deter-
mined to do it i came to the conclusion that the
men behind the north american school of draw-
ing who issued the book meant just what they
said so i took up their offer to teach me-or
tefund the money i paid

  i had always wanted to draw continued jack
so i stuck to the lessons they sent me

  and- i prompted

come down to my studio tomorrow he grinned 
as he left the car and i will show you the results
when jack had left me i felt convinced that i
too could do the same so
when the book from the
school arrived the follow-
ing morning i read it right
through with more than
casurl interest

  i thought of jacks won-
derful success and decided
to enroll for a course there
and then

  i was soon studying the
lessons in my spare time
at heme i found myself
carried away by the case
with which i acquired a
mastery over my brush
and pencil

my first
attempt

torittoday

  one day i thought of a
good idea for a poster i
sat down sketched it out
and worked it up into a
finished drawing when i
commcnced the sketch i
had no idea of attempting
to sell it but when it was
finished i liked it so well

	that i sent it to the art
director of an advertising
ajjpncy imagine my sur
prise when a few days
later a check arrived to-
gether with aletter asking me to call at their oftccs to
make arrangements to do some newspaper drawings
then i began sending odd sketohes to illustrated
papers and other advertising concerns of course
they were not all accepted fty any means but a num-
ber were and  soon found myself averaging a sub-
stantial weekly income

  when i told jack keating what i had done he
was delighted and surprised  ft only proves he
said that anyone wholikessketclmig can be taught
to produce the kind of drawings thnt editors and
advertisers w ant the w ork isnot as hard as it looks
when you have been shown ityw

a simple home
study method

through its simple methodical home study sy
tem the north american school of drawing teaches
you to draw just as any other school might teach
you tjj write shorthand or keep books or operate a
typewriter or any other everyday subject

there is no reason-why you too snould not do
equally as well if you have a liking for drawing

	 try it for yourself you can enroll with the north
american school of drawing without risking a
penny if you can draw at all you will astonish your-
self by your progress and you will find modern com-
mercial art one of the most fascinating occupations
that coukl be imagined the opportunities in this

certain basic ghost-story themes have been used again and again until
they have lost their savor the ghosts of fiction derive their interest
and fascination from their strangeness and if ghosts do the same
things in slightly different fashion through story after story then they be-
come as humdrum and uninteresting as the sight of a milk wagon to a night-
owl the ghost-stories in weird tales are different in this issue the ghost-
ly abbey that limns itself against the sky in the lord of the tarn when torkel
yarps hour arrives and the ghost of old morris revealing itself more and more
each day in the shadows until that terrific assault by the jumbee-these are
ghost-stories that are really out of the ordinary

  one ghostly yarn that has come to us in the mails at least a score of times is
the incident of the wager someone bets someone else that he or she does
not dare to spend the night in a certain haunted room or sometimes at a
haunted grave in the cemetery and to prove that the haunted place has
actually been visited the person is to drive a stake into the grave or nails into
a certain place in the floor of the haunted room but in the excitement and
terror of the occasion the person drives the stake or the nails through his
coat and when he tries to get away he finds that he is held by the fastened
coat which his excited imagination transforms into a ghost and he dies of
terror several times in rejecting stories based on this incident we have in-
quired of the authors how they happened to think up such a plot and in each
case the story had been told to the writer as an incident that had actually
happened so the writer worked it up into a story but the theme was already
used once in weird tales the ghost of liscard manor november issue
 and once is enough houdini in weird tales for may  related
the same incident as having been told him by his father   my father who has
also investigated phenomena and who was one of the pioneers in  relates
a story that in his student days one of the boys in his class had to drive a nail
in a wooden cross at midnight in the local cemetery and as he turned to flee a
hand readied out and held him fast he shrieked and shouted for help
screaming out that he was held by a ghostly hand but by the time assistance
arrived he was dead on the grave it appears that in driving the nail in he
had accidentally in his excitement nailed down the coat his mind had con-
jectured a hand reaching out from the grave and securing him

another ghost-story plot that appears with great regularity in our mail is

weird tales

continued from page 

this a man goes to sleep in a room that is supposed to be haunted awaking
in the middle of the night he imagines he sees a ghostly hand at the foot of the
bed opening fire at the hand he feels a stinging pain and realizes that the
supposed hand is his own foot and that he has blown off two of his toes this
theme has appeared at least fifty times in manuscripts submitted to weird
tales that is why the story is always returned to its author

    why not publish more chinese stories queries donald culhane of
butte montana in a letter to the eyrie and adds i can hardly stand the
suspense of waiting for the october issue so that i can finish the bride of
osiris it is thrilling 

    every issue of weird tales continues to amaze me writes charles
fingerman of camden new jersey the stories always fine improve each
month to such an extent that readers are lost in conjecture wondering how
standards like records can be broken so often for weird tales is always so
full of good stories splendidly told that no special standard can stand up for
any length of time as new ones in point of themes styles and denouements
are being created as fast as the old standards are toppled over  

    lutie keith of philadelphia expresses her reactions to this magazine in
verse we have not room to print the entire poem but give the first strophe

i lie awake far into the wee small hours and read weird tales

        while out in the shrouding gloom of the night i hear weird wails

        i know it is only the wind that moans in the tree-tops tall

        but to me it sounds like a disembodied souls despairing call

    weird tales today is in a class by itself writes charles m stephens
of brooklyn new york  it is as fine a magazine as any the world over but
everybodys saying that and no wonder with all its wealth of good reading
eli colters the bark chrysalis is a masterpiece ive just finished it and
man its a story that blazes new trails in fiction he deserves all sorts of
congratulations for many hours of fine entertainment i am indebted also
to h p lovecraft seabury quinn h warner munn frank belknap long
jr nictzin dyalhis greye la spina victor rousseau and others who have
written such exceptional fiction for weird tales

    in the september issue the best story was undoubtedly the moon men-
ace writes fred w fischer jr of knoxville tennessee  though it was
closely pressed for this honor by sax rohmers weird oriental story lord of
the jackals i wish to congratulate you on your new artist hugh rankin
edward t radcliffe of portsmouth virginia writes to the eyrie i
am so enthusiastic about weird tales that i want to write and let you know
just how much i appreciate it i started reading it about a year ago and
since then i have been a booster for it from the ground up it is s different
from the usual type of magazine-the stories take you from the everyday
realms of life it is a pity that it only comes out once a month my favorite
authors are seabury quinn eli colter and greye la spina lets have some
more stories of the exploits of jules de gran din they are excellent-but
colters the dark chrysalis is one of the best stories i ever read

    i have been a reader of weird tales a long time writes grace m
wise of corbett oregon and of all the magazines i read it is my favorite

she comes to me in the midnight oft when the pleasures of day are fled
and their dregs leave bitterest longing and unspeakable regret-

a hopeless hungring yearning that in vain i would forget-

then the mists back roll and my naked soul with her presence is beset

her eyes outrival the mist-moonshine in their silken soulless glow

the tints of the yellow autumn cling to her billowy hair

cold as the hand of death with no life-light lingering there

is her ashen cheek and the wan lips speak ever despair despair

she points me back to the far-fled past-a weary waste outspun-

where unfinished tasks are lying that my hands had cast aside

and smoldering ashes telling where the old ambitions died

when the scarlet flame of carnal shame to the heart was made a bride

and onward points to the nearing end where shadows close and cling
while my shriveling form stands quaking on the brink of the black un-
known 

afar like glints of dawning lifes ideal heights are shown

but hope has fled for the soul lies dead where the wasted days are strown

and i shudder back in the ghostly arms and the soulless eyes i seek
which gleam neath the yellow autumn tints that cling to the billowy hair
cold as the hand of death with no hope-light lingering there

is the ashen face and the wan lips trace ever despair despair


they thought iwas a weak sister
-but i took their breath amy

what  minutes a day
will show you

all of a sudden the office was very quiet as some-
times happens for an instant or two and a few
wwords reached me oh he wont dare kick
the manager was saying hes a pretty weak sister
mechanically i went on with my work wondering
vaguely who the weak sister could be a new man
had just been hired for our de-
partment and desks were being
moved to make room for him a
minute later i looked up and saw
the chief clerk standing at my
side bob he crisply ordered

move your desk back in that
corner i want this space for
the new assistant ive hired

then he turned and strode away

  i gulped and wilted down into
my chair i was the wieak sis-
ter  and i was actually being
demoted the new man was be-
ing hired for my place this
was my reward for all my hard
work-this was how i won out
by waiting patiently for my turn
to be promoted i had even con-
gratulated myself on my close-
upped reserved manner - i
thought i was showing strength
of character by sticking to my
work and not trying to push
myself-to show off

  and that was the whole trou-
 jadptenty of steel ap makeup but i had
no ability to express myself i was timid self-con-
scious and actually afraid of my own voice i would
study out the office problems and find solutions for
our difficulties but i didnt know how to present these
ideas to the man up ahead several of the boys who
nacl started at the time i did were now department
managers-because they had the knack of forceful
speech self-confidence and personality-the very

 were so amazed that they gave mo
 full power to carry out my ideas

i leave you to choose the manner of your death

wtou see before you said
v sark darlin with a gesture
jo toward his office window
the realization of a dream that en-
dured for a thousand years eight-
een generations of long-lived archi-
tects have had their part in the
dream and through that window you
see the result

   of course i had seen it before but
i never tired of it sark darlin
had reason to be proud the culmi-
nation this man of a thousand years
of specialization he was old and
his wife had given him no man-child
to carry on the family tradition the
growth of city of the east would die
with sark darlin and a little of the
sadness of it showed in his face as he
beckoned me to the window i as his
son-in-law must take up the torch he

must relinquish but i-i was not a
darlin and the pill was a bitter one
for sark to swallow yet he loved
me else he never would have allowed
my addresses to his daughter-for
that is the law

  his hand was on my shoulder as
we stood side by side and gazed from
the window we were in his office on
the top floor of the executive build-
ing five hundred stories above
ground level outside the window
the platform for the landing of
monopters thrust outward into space
looking downward beyond the edge
of the platform i could see the
other platforms below one at each
window scores and scores of them
like perches before the uncount-
able doors of some mighty gar-
gantuan dovecote straight across

                                   


weird tales

from our window yet well below it
since the executive building is the
tallest in all the city were other
platforms and as we talked there
watching men and women and
children like monster bees dropped
from windows in their monopters
and glided across to this or that
window in the executive building
all the windows were numbered or
marked with other distinguishing
signs it was like this throughout
the whole city so that the great and
awesome canyons between the build-
ings were fairly alive with flitting
and industrious people going about
their mysterious business speedily
and in silence

  over the top of the building op-
posite i could see some of the other
buildings their spires glistening in
the sun now visible now obscured as
wraiths of white clouds like fingers
of some bodiless entity of space
moved into and along the canyons
below the spires many stories below
there often were clouds shutting out
the world beneath so that at times
looking from this window it was as
though our building had been cut in
twain somewhere below us leaving us
here in space immovable at such
times as these the myriad noises of
the city were muffled as well they
might be when one considers the
depth of the great canyons but
even then when impenetrable fog
held the whole city in its grip the
noises came up to us even through
the almost sound-proof walls of sark
darlins office a vast voiceless roar
as though some subterranean mon-
ster imprisoned in a pit that was
bottomless cried out in agony at
his restraint but the clouds white
misty draperies sent their tentacles
into the canyons and paid no heed
while the clouds were passing
through it was always interesting to
watch the monopters each encasing
a human being stand upright on the
platform patiently waiting for the

mists to lift or move on with clouds
in the canyons it was virtually sui-
cide to attempt a crossing from one
platform to another sark darlin i
knew had all but perfected a device
whereby monopters might be directed
at will toward a fixed destination but
the purpose of the invention had
been defeated because among the
mists monopters might collide and
their occupants be hurled to the
depths as we watched there while
i sensed without looking that the
face of sark darlin was radiant with
pardonable pride the platforms op-
posite were fairly aswarm with
monopters waiting for the mists to
lift or clear like doves standing be-
fore their cotes it was impossible
of course to tell which were men and
which were women not that it mat-
tered especially for in the city of
the east there is no difference be-
tween them save the fundamental
difference of sex and women and
men work side by side sark has told
me he having read extensively that
this was not so long ago but sark is
getting old and i have never believed
it to me it is inconceivable that
women were once considered to be of
a lower order than men-or the other
way around my principal reason
for loving the daughter of darlin is
that she can do everything that i can
do

  see gerd he pointed vaguely
beyond the window the city of
the east the greatest city of all
time the realization of a dream of
my first recorded ancestor would
that he lived today to see his dream
in truth as he must have seen it then
in his mind he promised himself
this dreamer-ancestor of mine to
dedicate his life to the building of
this city which lies before you and
the tradition was passed on to his
son and from him to his son and the
line has never been broken only
now is it threatened because my time
is coming lona is my only offspring
the invading horde



to her and to yon i tender the
torch which has burned brightly
through all the generations of the
darlins you and she must carry
on

  something of the solemnity of the
thing entered into me there as we
stood by the window i stood like a
statue his hand resting on my
shoulder barkening to the myriad
sounds of the city that persisted in
invading the silence of sark darlins
office-and realized a little of the tre-
mendous responsibility that was one
day to rest on my shoulders i shook
off the feeling however in a moment
and gazed into the old mans eyes

  nonsense i said sharply you
have twenty years of active service
before you yet you are only sixty-
five   

  sixty-five he repeated that
is young i know ordinarily i
should live to twice that age but
i have led a strenuous life and i
shall welcome the chance to leave it
behind me i have received warn-
ings-

  he pressed his white hand slim
and graceful as lonas against his
heart a pang shot through me i
wondered if something of his affliction
might not have been passed on to
lon a to win her for my own only
to lose her to death  but i shook
myself impatiently lona was too
young too replete with health and
brimming vitality

 so continued darlin you
must study city of the east as an
artizan studies craftsmanship every
spare hour must be spent in the air
learning all there is to learn about
this city in whose future you will
have such an active part the sun is
high now my son so drop off and
busy yourself this is a tremendous
responsibility i am passing on to
you

  i fancied i read a vague hint in his
voice as he said it as though he
somehow doubted his choice of a

successor-and decided instantly
that before he should leave us i
would erase any lingering doubt of
me his heart might harbor now
however there were other things to
do he had bade me go and to obey
his slightest wish was my law-since
i was soon to become his son-in-law
we stepped back from the window
and darlin kept up a running fire of
conversation while i stepped into
my monopter and adjusted the fila-
ment wires to the headpiece which
last of all would be set in place
closing the monopter to all sound
save that which was transmitted by
the mechanism of the wireless tele-
phone inside the headpiece

with sark darlins words ring-
ing in my ears i stepped to the
window darlin opened it and
closed it swiftly befund me i was
alone on the platform preparing my-
self for the duty to follow to see
and to learn and to remember and
the whole of city of the east was my
place of operation added to this
duty which i loved was the antici-
pation of again seeing lona who had
promised to meet me at the fifty
thousand foot air lane directly east
of the executive building at the
edge of the great rampart which
holds back the rising waters of the
vast atlantic-our usual trysting
place where hand in hand commun-
ing by telephone we were accustomed
to flying far out to sea beyond the
usual range of other monopters
where we might enjoy the privacy
our love demanded from day to
day i lived in anticipation of that
winging flight outward from the
great rampart in which like a lord
and lady of creation we talked
lovers nonsense and looked down
upon the vast dominion we were to
inherit from sark darlin

  my heart was all aflutter as i
stood on the platform waiting for tfie
mists to disperse slightly before


weird tales

leaping into space i knew that be-
hind me sark darlin stood by the
window wishing me a silent god-
speed

  the monopter as you must know
is nothing more nor less than a slip-
over suit of specially prepared ma-
terial which equipped with a tiny
atomic engine resting compactly be-
hind and between the shoulders of the
wearer keeps out the cold of the
higher altitudes no one has yet
found it necessary to ascend to any
altitude greater than fifty thousand
feet which is almost the ceiling for
monopters there are air lanes be-
low this level a lane for each two
hundred feet in fact and each type
of monopter passenger and freight
keeps to its particular level assigned
by law the monopters of the various
trades and strata of society being
designated by words on the outside of
each monopter as for example
engineer air lane  or
building level  air lane -
 this last indicates that the
occupant of the monopter is a man or
woman from that city level indicated
by the two hundredth story of city
buildings assigned by law to air
lane  which is to say that
monopters from this level must con-
fine themselves to an elevation not
greater than  feet the first
designation is virtually self-explana-
tory indicating that the engineers
whose business is the building of the
city of the east to still grander pro-
portions are allowed to ascend to the
highest lane whence they are enabled
to view everything below them which
includes every activity known at
present to the city of the east i am
of the engineers soon to be the head
of the guild through my marriage
to lona darlin but in reference to
the monopter as i say it is no more
than a slip-over suit entirely enclos-
ing the occupant and the motive
power is supplied by a small com-
pact atomic engine an invention of

sark darlin and is guided and di-
rected by tiny buttons inside the
finger-tips of the right glove in the
air the monopter and its occupant
are one entity directed by one brain
lenses of specially prepared material
with fused quartz as the principal
alloy allow the eyes of the occupant
full view in all directions or as far
as the eyes may swerve in any direc-
tion to look at the rear requires a
turning of the entire monopter
from which it may be seen that a
person in the air is virtually the same
in appearance as a person on the
ground free of the monopter with
the exception of the slight enlarge-
ment of the head and torso caused by
the covering which houses the engine
of propulsion and the mechanism of
the headpiece it is as though man
had suddenly lifted into the air on
invisible wings and when all the
monopters of the city of the east are
in the air which seldom happens at
one time the city resembles more
than ever a gigantic dovecote with
its inhabitants circling about in prep-
aration for landing filling the air to
the very crest of air lane 
an awe-inspiring sight even when
as i am one is accustomed to it

  standing on the platform before
sark darlins window i was glad
that i had locked myself securely in-
side my monopter for i was slightly
giddy with my thoughts inspired by
the stupendous responsibility soon to
be mine and in my excitement
might have fallen from the platform
this would have been disastrous had
i as i sometimes did left the fasten-
ing of the headpiece of the monopter
until i had taken my place on the
narrow platform now however it
would have been perfectly safe to
step off into space and drop like a
plummet for to slacken speed re-
quired but the pressure of finger on
button so that i would have landed
at the bottom of this great canyon as
the invading horde



lightly as a feather fluttering down-
ward

  it has always been a great moment
for me a thrilling moment to stand
on the platform before leaping out-
ward from far below comes the
bellowing voice of the city welling
up like thunder from the depths
rattling the very headpiece about my
ears causing my whole body to
tremble so that the platform under
my feet seems to sway as though
some invisible hand is shaking it
from side to side a eloud of snowy
whiteness passes through the can-
yon below me blotting out some of
the sound shutting out the world
below so that it seems the world as

i	know it has its foundation in
space with spires and towers afloat
in the whiteness a city in the air
the moving of the clouds gives the
sense of motion so that as i gaze
at the building across from me
it seems to be leaning in my direc-
tion so that i have an insane de-
sire to leap into space before it
shall have toppled against the exe-
cutive building and both shall have
fallen crashing into the canyon
even the executive building seems
to be moving as though it tilted
away from me toppling me foiward
so that i unconsciously lean back-
ward to keep from falling over the
edge it is intoxicating and i never
tire of this experience but a tap-
ping sound comes through the
phones and i turn to look at the
window through which i have just
stepped sark darlin is tapping the
window with one hand while his
other hand makes a sweeping
gesture which bids me soar aloft on
the business assigned me thus in
a gesture i am brought back to the
matter in hand recalled to a mission
that never becomes humdrum

  however just for the joy of fall-
ing i step to the edge of the plat-
form and lean forward until the pull
of gravitation topples me from my

perch and i go plummeting down-
ward i always revel dropping
thus in the thought that there may
be something wrong with my
monopter and that i shall not bo
able to halt my downward flight i
might have failed to connect some
all-important filament a failure that
would assuredly spell disaster but
when i decide to cheek my falling
speed slackens gradually until by
an effort of will i am moving in the
opposite direction upward once
this is accomplished the matter is
simple i keep on climbing straight
into the clouds

 my flight upward is uninter-
rupted for the aerial traffic laws
compel monopters already in the air
to keep out of the way of monopters
ascending or descending while in
the up and down traffic descending
monopters keep out of the way of
those ascending

  so in a few moments i find my
monopter becoming almost station-
ary indicating that i have reached
air lane  or the ceiling for
monopters  feet above ground
level here for a moment i tilt for-
ward to peer down what a mag-
nificent sight no wonder sark
darlin is proud air lane after air
lane each alive with its myriads of
flitting darting monopters as the
individuals occupying them scurry
here and there toward unknown
destinations a veritable cloud
black layer upon black layer ex-
tending downward to swathe the
very buildings of the city of the
east a cloud moreover through
which it is easy to get glimpses of
the city itself

as i have said before the highest
building is the executive build-
ing  stories almost in the mathe-
matical center of the city all
about this building are grouped the
others many of them far more mas-
sive most of them in fact sinee


weird tales

executive building is more like a
slender spire than a building-and
they vary in height from two hun-
dred and fifty stories to four hundred
and ninety the latter building being
an annex to the executive building
housing the subordinates and ap-
prentices of the engineers who
themselves are housed in the execu-
tive building this latter building
with its sprawling annex is the most
industrious hive in all the city its
work is the citys progress its
officials are the city administrators

  a city of spires of great heights
cloud-wreathed reaching to all the
horizons a city of mighty canyons
since the invention of monopters
made it possible to remove the sus-
pension bridges of my fathers time
a city-but i find this the best
simile it is as though a great piece
of cardboard cut to represent on a
tiny scale all the country lying be-
tween the atlantic and the missis-
sippi so-named in ancient times
and extending into the region of
cold to the north and the region of
the tropics to the south-and this
cardboard literally obliterated from
view by pins thrust upward from
the underside a vast pin-cushion
with all the points extending out-
ward only the pins of the simile
are the towers and spires of the city
of the east the sun glistening on
the spires bears out the simile for
the spires shine in its rays like pin-
pricks of silver deluging the sky
with silvery glamor a marvelous
creation full-sprung from the brain
of eighteen generations of darlins

  but i turn for the flight into the
east where at the edge of the great
rampart i have an appointment
with lona together after our
lonely flight hand in hand across
the waters of the atlantic we will
come back across the city of the
east which we must one day govern
to examine the invisible frontier
this frontier if i may explain in

passing is that invisible line of
demarcation beyond which people
of the west may not come-for they
are aliens these people are the
races of color which occupy all the
country west of the mississippi
representing the descendants of the
races of color who centuries ago all
but overthrew the people of the
american white race only the
foresight of one of the darlins pre-
vented this racial catastrophe he
had already caused the installation
of the invisible frontier

  in itself the frontier is simplicity
at each quarter-mile along its length
is a tiny station housing a eorps of
engineers whose duty it is to see
that the mechanism of the aerial ray
producers do not fail these rays
which are invisible are hurled into
the sky to a height twice that of the
ceiling of the most perfect monopter
and played back and forth so that it
would be impossible for any person
of the west to pass through the in-
visible wall for to attempt such a
foolhardy thing would be death no
monopter has yet been perfected
which is able to pass through this
wall of rays certain foolhardy
people of the west have tried it
only to have their monopters less
perfect than ours melt away from
about them allowing the occupants
to plummet to the earth-a painless
death after all since even before the
beginning of the downward plunge
the occupant of the offending
monopter has been burned to a
cinder

  only through a traitor along the
invisible frontier would the in-
vasion of the people of the west be
possible we have long known that
the scientists of this country of the
west have been trying to perfect
machines capable of passing through
the frontier for these people breed
like flies and must eventually find
some place for their expanding pop-
ulation or perish but the possi-
the invading horde



bility of a traitor a man or woman
who would deliver the city of the
east into the hands of the races of
coloi would be unthinkable the
attack when it does come must be
from another direction and-but one
shudders to think of such a catas-
trophe

  so i thought as i fled eastward
toward the great rampart little
guessing that already an attack was
being launched and that lona and
i were to witness the very first con-
tact



the speed of my monopter is three
hundred miles an hour so that
it is a pleasure jaunt from the center
of city of the east to the edge of the
great rampart-a pleasure jaunt all
the more pleasant because i know i
shall find lona at my destination
lona there is romance in her very
name thig flesh and blood woman
sired by sark darlin the greatest
living architect to whom he was
soon to turn over the vast responsi-
bilities inherent in his dreams to
lona and to myself as one after the
marriage which should take place
very soon but never too soon to
please me lona the bright-
cheeked girl of the golden hair and
the form of a goddess of the olden
times when men had not yet con-
quered the air lanes but crawled
slowly along the ground in liquid-
driven clumsy vehicles or soared to
unimportant heights in unwieldy
machines even more clumsy lona
whose very name spoke of perfec-
tion and i was huirying into the
east to keep my daily tryst with her

  already far ahead i could see the
mists which shroud the shoreline of
the atlantic and was glancing
about me among the hurrying
myriads of monopters seeking that
which bore upon its crest the swas-
tika-and-star which is the signal of

the house of darlin only sark
darlin himself who rarely makes
use of the monopter of his own in-
vention and lona may wear the in-
signia of the star superimposed upon
the swastika the significance of
the signal has been lost in antiquity
but the whole city of the east
knows that inside the monopter
marked with the swastika-and-star
is lona the promised bride of gerd
sota myself

  so speeding eastward with now
and then a glance downward into
the vast canyons of city of the east
evading the streams of other monop-
ters to right and left of me by in-
stinct i pondered the matter i
wonder now as i look back upon
that flight whether i didnt really
harbor some slight intuition of the
catastrophe so soon to follow per-
haps else why had the thought of
attack obtruded itself upon my con-
sciousness men and women in
other monopters at my level all of
them belonging to this lane because
of their importance in the city of
the east raised their arms to me in
passing and i returned their silent
greetings abstractedly the word
had already gone forth i could see
that gerd sota was soon to take the
place of sark darlin as chief admin-
istrator of city of the east and
these greetings from the other
monopters were silent pledges of
fealty soon the very least of these
would carry out orders originating
with me or with lona

  but i was approaching the great
rampart which merits a brief
description the first noticeable
rising of the waters of the atlantic
is shrouded in remote antiquity
suffice it that the first darlin took
cognizance and caused the first
stones of the great rampart to be
laid at first it was only a great
wall a thousand feet in width and
two hundred feet of elevation a
fortress against the ocean from


weird tales

which i know that the rising of the
waters had been an exceedingly slow
progress since the base of that first
wall is at the present moment but
fifty feet below the surface of the
atlantic i can however but mar-
vel at the foresight of the first in-
spired darlin for even that fifty
feet of rise would have spelled dis-
aster had there been no wall how-
ever as time passed and as the
population of the city of the east
increased and especially after the
invasion of the races of color when
the white race was driven back
from the pacific back behind the
mississippi at whose farther side the
invisible frontier had already been
installed and beyond which the
races of color could not penetrate it
became increasingly evident that
because the people of the white race
literally covered the ground level
the only possible expansion must be
upward

  under the leadership of a darlin
every able-bodied man and woman
was pressed into service hills and
mountains were leveled overnight
and from the very bowels of the
earth came the materials which
went into building of the great
rampart from great depths they
came those materials for this far-
sighted darlin wished to preserve as
much of the native soil as was
humanly possible from which to get
the food to feed the city of his
dreams and as his myriad army of
laborers moved westward from the
first great rampart the wall itself
was broadened and on its first
humble beginnings that thousand-
foot-wide barrier was erected the
first series of the then highest build-
ings in all the world but the first
one was an insignificant hundred
and fifty stories so that our shore-
line which should really be a thing
of beauty is but a drab collection of
time-worn ill-shaped comparatively
tiny buildings

  but that was a beginning and

with this as a starting-point the wall
itself was extended so that today
the ground is invisible and the bot-
tom of the deepest canyon in the
city is two hundred feet above
ground level beneath this level ex-
panse of imperishable stone are the
menials subjugated peoples who toil
in slavery to feed the multitudes
above them one wonders at the
fears which must ever be with them
when they realize the number of un-
countable tons of material which
hover over them but all they see
are the great pilings which are the
foundations of the great rampart
upon which in turn the buildings
of the city of the east have been
erected these pilings so sark
darlin has told me are of slender-
ness unbelievable but the matter of
stresses and strains has been worked
out so carefully that there is little
doubt that the city will stand im-
movable for centuries yet to come
the slenderness was made necessary
in order that every available bit of
ground might be cultivated the
menials are never allowed above
ground level and are the only in-
habitants of city of the east who
are denied the use of monopters

  so to sum it all up the great
rampart except where it sets flush
with hills of solid stone left by the
builders extends from the shore of
the atlantic to what was the missis-
sippi before its waters were di-
verted to the use of the white race
it is a veritable white city and no
ground at all is visible save that
which may be seen when the waters
of the atlantic are clear extending
from the shore to that point where
they vanish into the depths

  some day city of the east will
extend still farther eastward for on
our journeys lonas and mine over
the waters we have discussed this
possibility of further vanquishing
the waters driving them back be-
the invading horde



fore a moving wall of stone but all
that is in the future it will be my
problem god willing and lonas
for day by day people are being
born faster than they die so that
inevitably city of the east must
grow to house its myriads of inhab-
itants

  among other duties i must strive
to familiarize myself with the duties
of the menials but that will come
later i must know sark darlin tells
me something of the vast quantities
of food necessary to sustain the life
of city of the east so that i can
plan against the future when the
population will be too great to feed
under present arrangements an-
other glimpse of the varied respon-
sibility which is to be mine-

erd gerd

  musically the name beats
against my eardrums from the
phones i know that marvelous
voice somewhere among the
monopters which hem me in lona is
calling my name directing the
sound into space seeking me she
knows that i should be in this
vicinity now and that in a few min-
utes i should catch her signal

 gerd gerd

  i know that she is approaching
from somewhere off to my right as
i can tell by my direction finder
so upon the membrane which
presses tightly against my lips i
speak her name putting into its
pronunciation all of the love i bear
her

  lona beloved

  wait gerd i am coming

  so i slacken my terrific speed into
the east remaining virtually motion-
less as i revolve slowly seeking
among the myriads of monopters for
that on whose crest is the sign of the
swastika-and-star i locate it finally
far below off to the right shooting
up toward me from perhaps the five
thousand foot level the monopter

which causes my heart to leap with
excitement for on its crest gleam-
ing in the sun is the sign of the
swastika-and-star i raise my arms
and touch my fingers above my
head holding the pose until lona
has picked me out-a pre-arranged
signal between us for being below
me she can not see my own insignia
unless i stand on my head which is
unpleasant if one must hold the posi-
tion for any length of time she
waves her hand to indicate that she
has seen my signal and in a moment
her monopter is beside mine and
hand in hand we continue the dash
into the east toward the shoreline
which is now visible with the vast
blue canvas beyond a canvas ex-
tended to north and south to be lost
in the mists of distance paralleled
by the great rampart as far as the
eye can see even when aided by the
magnifying qualities of the eye-
lenses that glide into place when i
will it

  gerd it is almost a whisper
scarcely breathing through the
phones

  my heart fills unaccountably
with a feeling of dread lona is
alarmed there is no mistaking that
fact she has witnessed something
dreadful while awaiting my arrival
but i wait for her to tell me

  gerd and i know she is striv-
ing for control to tell her story i
thought you would never come dear
you are on time sweetheart-i am
not censuring you but i have been
in agony because there was no one
to whom i dared entrust this news
of mine i could have sent the mes-
sage to father sark but there was
a chance that it might be picked up
by some enemy and my purpose de-
feated thats why i am now talking
to you in our own private code for
all i know though it may be a silly
womans fears the monopters all
about us may encase the persons of
enemies or traitors


weird tales

  she paused and my heart leaped
again because of her absolute trust
in me because she believed that i
gerd sota would know the proper
thing to do but i knew that had
i not arrived as arranged lona her-
self would undoubtedly have done
whatever avas necessary and she
would have made no error in judg-
ment i waited wondering in
dread for her to continue

  but she said no more she merely
gripped my hand and i fancied
though it was more mental sugges-
tion than speech that the phones
carried to my ears the single whis-
pered word speed

  for side by side our hands
clasped tightly we were rushing
eastward with a speed such as i
never before had flown the other
monopters in this air lane seemed to
go back from us as we passed  as
though they had been standing still
yet i knew that they traveled at a
speed in excess of two hundred miles
an hour it was like traveling
through a veritable fog of monop-
ters held in aerial suspension but
the swastika-and-star on lonas
crest assured us of a clear right of
way so that there was no danger of
collision even had i not released
the outside buzzer which cast a radio
warning forth into the air so that
monopters in our path would draw
aside

  speed speed speed the air
through which we fled met us like a
wall right below us now was the
edge of the great rampart its white
immensity bathed in flying spume at
its ponderous base as the waves
mountain-high because of a gather-
ing storm threshed out their futile
strength against that stony inspira-
ion of the first of the darlins but
we did not pause lona gripped my
hand so that i turned to look into
her eyes it is difficult to see eyes
through the intervening lenses of

two monopters but i could see
lonas as though their very inten-
sity of gaze commanded they were
large and frightened and as soon as
she knew i had seen she raised her
free arm and pointed out to sea

  then i noticed an odd phenom-
enon the beating of the waves
against the great rampart was only
a local disturbance covering a dis-
tance of perhaps five miles to right
and left of where we were-and ten
miles out to sea the surface of the
atlantic was as smooth as a mill-
pond it was unbelievable as
though some monster of the deep
faced this particular portion of the
great rampart and lashed a mighty
tail in fury causing the waters to
crash against the immovable stone
breaking high along the face of the
great rampart bathing it in flying
angry spume what had caused this
vast disturbance what mighty up-
heaval in the depths of mother at-
lantic was thus arousing her ancient
displeasure  and catching a
glimpse again of lonas face i saw
that it was white and set-and a
little of her abject fear communi-
cated itself to me through our
clasped hands

 what is it lona for gods
sake tell me

 wait

  i knew then that she intended
showing me and dread was at my
throat again i knew that i was
destined to witness some monstrous
thing yet why should i be afraid
lona undoubtedly had already
seen yet she was going back-with
me some of her invincible courage
imparted itself to me with the
thought so that i resolved come
what might to live up to her faith-
and to dispel the haunting doubt of
sark darlin which i had detected
in his voice as he had wished me
godspeed at the beginning of my
flight from the executive building
the invading horde



vjow we were hurtling straight out
to sea while looking backward
with a swift turn of my head i
could see that the waves still broke
as high as ever against the great
rampart but i could not see into
the depths here it was as though
all the ocean were a-boil lashing
the surface to a white foam so that
only the surface was visible what
monstrous thing wallowed just be-
low us invisible below the mantle of
white which made of this section of
the coast a boiling cauldron

 lona again grasped my hand
tightly our speed slackened as
though her will had dominated mine
so that i slackened my own monop-
ter instinctively

  look down gerd she said
below the surface study the
depths as soon as we are far enough
out to be beyond the milky white-
ness of the boiling water move
slowly or we may pass it

  what did she mean i was soon
to know for gradually the whiteness
of the puzzling boiling faded so
that here and there i caught
glimpses of the blue of the depths
into which at intervals i could
penetrate with my eyes i pressed
my free hand to a button outside
my headpiece and powerful lenses
dropped into place before my eyes
i had only aped lona in this for i
had seen her own eyes vanish be-
hind opacity as she did the same
thing we were both virtually
motionless in the air now except
that we dropped gradually down-
ward leaning forward both so that
our view beneath would be unob-
structed

  i almost leaped free of my monop-
ter when i saw the thing it was
monstrous

  a submarine such as the wildest
nightmare might not have con-
ceived  even at the depth at which
it must have been lying for we were
several miles from shore the re-

flection of the suns rays from the
elliptical body of the thing was
blinding it must have been all of
a mile in length and it rested on the
bottom bioadside to the shore and
the great rampart a silvery mass
of what looked to be a mountain of
gleaming steel a metal monster
beyond all imagining there was
no propeller that i could see though
taking its vast size into considera-
tion it was now not inconceivable
that the thing might be provided
with a myriad of metal legs on
which it had walked the oceans
floor following the coastline from-
where it was not hard to guess
when one took into consideration the
desperate necessity of the races of
color to secure the vast country in
which was city of the east

  the more i thought of it the more
i was sure that the metal thing was
possessed of legs that it was a sense-
less amphibian it had probably fol-
lowed the coast into the south from
some place on the north pacific
thence by land across the neck con-
necting the two great americas
reason tottered as i strove to fancy
this great thing walking across the
isthmus trampling whole mountains
under foot wiping out cities and
towns which stood in the way but
what was it doing here its activi-
ties were making a boiling cauldron
of this portion of the ocean but how 

  in the instant of asking the ques-
tion i knew the answer for by
scores and hundreds there darted
from the massive side of the thing
under water egg-shaped things not
unlike our own monopters tiny
submarines these each with a man
inside it that was the answer
there were thousands of them so
that darting into the deep water
visible until they had entered the
boiling area to be lost from view
they looked like a vast school of
speedy fish darting headlong toward
that section of the great rampart


weird tales

upon which the waves were breaking
their crests into wisps of flying
spume that boiling had been in-
duced for the express purpose of
masking from the view of our aerial
scouts whatever the enemy was
doing

  even as one school of the tiny sub-
marines darted into the whiteness
another emerged from it dashing
against the side of the metal monster
to be taken in and absorbed like a
great fish spawning then receiving
lier young into her body again even
as i thought this my brain working
furiously to find a solution school
after school of them broke from the
whiteness and were lost in the side of
the monster

  inside my left glove which is part
of the monopter my fingers worked
like mad upon the tiny instrument
with which in the air i keep in con-
tact with sark darlin i gave him
the section of the rampart where the
mysterious activity was going on
and a brief description of the mon-
ster in the slime below of the tiny
submarines which their work already
accomplished perhaps were return-
ing to the mtlier sub with the speed
of game fish

 faintly to my ears came the
answer of sark darlin

  i have your message i am act-
ing watch the big submarine

  by the renewed pressure on my
hand i knew that lona too had
caught her fathers message motion-
less there both leaning forward
watching the metal monster fever-
ishly we were totally unprepared for
what followed for behind us with
a roar that made the very air about
us a seething maelstrom a five-mile
section of the great rampart carry-
ing with it the hundred and fifty
story buildings of early days leaped
skyward and crashed back again a
smoking powdery ruin-into which
on the instant poured the mighty
atlantic to fill the breach

  simultaneously the surface of the
seething ocean became a welter of
dismembered horribly mangled
corpses but all that i could see
were nude saik darlin then had
acted in time when he had had but
seconds in which to do so only the
unimportant menials had suffered
from the catastrophe

  a monster wave breaking against
the broken wall beyond the breach
rolled back to sea-a veritable moun-
tain of water i saw it crash against
the metal monster in the depths
swiftly she heeled over-and i knew
my first guess had been correct
metal legs waved in sight for a few
moments as the thing strove to right
itself then they disappeared in all
their monstrous bigness and tentacle-
like waving as the submarine came
back upright and with the same
motion swerved to the right to dis-
appear like some unbelievable deep-
sea fish into the darkness of the
atlantic



a kind providence must have been
with us at that moment for we
faced each other and i took her
hands in mine while our eyes met in
questioning and horror i am sure
that this involuntary instinctive
clasp of hands saved the life of lona
in the instant of the clasp while
those soundless messages passed be-
tween us the aerial maelstrom caused
by the explosion and attendant rup-
ture of the great rampart was upon
us-a shock such as i hope never
again to feel

  the noise of city of the east is a
vast and awesome thing when one
hears it without the ears protected
multiply that sound by a thousand
and you have some idea of the shock
which that explosion caused us and
we almost ten miles off-shore from
the breach in the wall it was like
being instantly compressed in a
monster vise with all the fiends
the invading hottde



above and below the earth hurling
gibes into the teeth of the sufferer so
that palsied hands fly to ears and fill
them to save the hearing one

wonders at the massive strength of
that great submarine that it was not
riven in twain at the explosion for
even as the swirl and crush of the
gases broke about us i glanced down
to see that among the out-floating
corpses of the menials fishes of all
sizes of many schools had turned
their white bellies upward on the
stormy surface of the water below

but the other sensation was even
more terrifying we had clasped
hands lona and i and the mael-
strom whirled us over and over dis-
tant from each other by the lengths
of our two pairs of arms clinging for
life now lona would be above me
like some fantastic acrobat balanc-
ing on my upraised hands then we
changed positions all in the batting
of an eyelash a speed of movement
that was doubly terrifying first i
gazed at the sea below me apparently
looking up then i would look up-
ward at the sky so that all the uni-
verse seemed turning topsyturvy
with unbelievable speed i realized
one thing instantly then a thing that
froze me with dread remembering
the white bellies of the fishes so far
below me lona was unconscious
only because i held so tightly to her
hands was she saved from the fright-
ful plunge through thirty thousand
feet of space into the ocean-for i
judged that we had dropped that far
below air lane  before the
breaking of the tragic storm

three men rolled from the
monopter and each held a
slender tube in his blackened
fingers


weird tales

    was lona dead could i support
  her dead weight and transport us
  back to some safe platform in city of
  the east id do it i told myself
  or plunge with her to the depths
  for if she fell from me i had no de-
  sire to live so i clung to her and
  prayed

    slowly when the swirling of the
  aerial maelstrom had abated some-
  what so that i found myself once
  more in a state of equilibrium lona
  hanging before me her head against
  my limbs i faced toward city of the
  east and drove my monopter toward
   safety was she dead could i
  maintain my grasp upon her hands
  would the mechanism of my monop-
  ter support us both the answer to
  the last question was capable of
  a speedy solution we were making
  excellent time toward the shore but
  we were losing altitude with fearful
  rapidity-a planing plide that seemed
  endless

    it seemed hours but reason told
  me but a few minutes had passed
  before i sank all but exhausted on
  a platform of a building just west-
  ward of the breach in the rampart
  with the still unconscious lona
  clinging to my hands i sat down
  weakly and held her in my arms

    all this time my phones had been
  transmitting a message from sark
  darlin but i could not use my
  hands to answer him he was ask-
  ing after my safety and lonas and
  for information about the great sub-
  marine clasping lona the more
  tightly with my right hand for the
  number on the window back of me
  told me that we were two hundred
  stories above the bottom of this par-
  ticular street-canyon i managed to
  send a feeble message of reassurance
  through the air to sark darlin he
  must have caught it instantly for his
  answer came back after i had as-
  sured him of our return

   thank god

   i whispered the words myself

reverently for lona had stirred in
my arms she was not dead and i
lived again i unfastened the head-
piece of her monopter so that she
might have the fresher air outside
unfastened my own headpiece and
placed it close beside me lona
opened her eyes her whole body
quivered in my arms in a shudder i
understood she was after all a
woman and i loved her she said
nothing of our return from above the
atlantic though she must have
known how she had been brought
back but her eyes were eloquent i
had saved her life more than ever
now was that life a part of my own
our lips came together in a kiss
which was a delirium of happiness
of which there is all too little in this
world of ours

it was lona who first recalled the
horror we had witnessed

  quick gerd she exclaimed
rising to her feet wavering so that i
held her fast lest she topple from the
platform our headpieces imme-
diately  i am all right now we
must get back to father sark he
needs us as all city of the east
needs us now

 i made no reply none was
needed she had spoken truth our
headpieces were replaced swiftly
and in silence still hand in hand
we soared aloft from the platform
rising straight upward between the
walls of the street-canyon until we
had cleared the tallest buildings
about us then straight as homing
pigeons we turned our goggled faces
toward executive building a vast
white needle eastward did i fancy
it or had an ominous black cloud
suddenly dropped down to hover
above the spire of the building of
the engineers

  i do not know i do know that as
we fled toward executive building
through air lanes that now were
silent and deserted because of the
the invading horde



catastrophe a vaster dread than any
which had yet been mine was at my
throat

  what must be done to combat this
monstrous menace that had come to
us from the deeps of the ocean for
centuries we had been looking to our
invisible frontier as protection and
this had been so perfected that noth-
ing had yet been invented which
could pass through or over the wall
of the rays but we had paid little
heed to the ocean we knew that
city of the west the city of the
aliens possessed monopters as good
as our own yet our whole city was
surrounded by that invisible fron-
tier save only that side which faced
the ocean we had thought of sub-
marines as obsolete and our cock-
sureness was threatening us with dis-
aster of course we were not being
caught entirely unprepared for that
would have been the height of folly
we had prepared after a fashion
against attack from the atlantic by
separating city of the east into sec-
tions each of which could be isolated
in a second by the man at the key-
board in sark darlins office-so
that were entrance gained to any one
section that section could be shut off
from the city at once and the re-
mainder of the city be as impreg-
nable as before this had been my
reason for sending that message
naming the section when i had
caught my first glimpse of the great
submarine sarks instant warning
had cleared that section of the people
who mattered in fancy i could see
them quitting those buildings in their
monopters like swift birds that are
flushed by the hunter some of
course had been caught but there
had been few for i had been able to
distinguish below us only the nude
bodies of the menials

 of this i was thinking as we
hurtled toward the executive build-
ing wondering subconsciously at the
black cloud which hid the glistening

spire in which was the office of sark
darlin-wondering at its meaning
and why a vague intuition told me
that all was not well

  nearer and nearer we flew yet the
spire did not appear from the black
cloud that meant we should have to
land on some lower platform until
the lifting of the cloud delay de-
lay delay but we dropped down
into the canyon swiftly along the
edge of that ominous cloud and
landed upon the first platform of the
executive building we could see
and made a ghastly discovery

  there was no spire of the execu-
tive building this platform upon
which we stood was the highest plat-
form remaining of the needlelike
shaft which was the building of the
engineers we stood on a platform
on the four hundred and ninety-
eighth story there should have been
two stories above us yet half of
story  all of story  and the
glistening white spire which had been
the pride of sark darlin were gone
all the mass of the building above
where we stood had been sheared off
as though a great knife had passed
cleanly through the building no-
debris at all and as far as we could
see none in the canyon below the
upper portion of executive building
had vanished from where we stood
we could look into what remained of
story  where the office appurte-
nances stood in the open as their flee-
ing users had left them no cover
above them to protect them from the
elements shadowed by the ominous
cloud which from a distance i had
thought obscured the crest of the
executive building

  lona and i still clasped hands
now her hand gripped mine more
tightly and i returned the pressure
no words were needed we both
knew that sark darlin had vanished
as mysteriously as his office had
vanished together with all of those
high officials who had occupied the


weird tales

offices that should have remained
above where we stood in one blow
mysteriously delivered the enemy
had shorn city of the east of leader-
ship then the realization following
on this thought staggered me i was
the leader now with lona my equal
in power in an instant that re-
sponsibility which i had not expected
to assume for years to come had
settled upon my shoulders-and i
must get busy at once

  that ominous cloud was settling
lona suddenly stepped to the edge of
the platform and dropped off into
space pulling me with her as we
fell plummeting downward her
words whispered into my ears

  that cloud gerd whatever
took daddy and the crest of execu-
tive building is inside that cloud
in another instant city of the east
would have been leaderless indeed
we must prepare

vye must prepare yet what

   v were we to do  for with the
obliterating of sark darlins office
had been obliterated that vast mech-
anism of his by which he had been in
communication with all the city
there was now no way to send forth
a warning but lona knew her
father had confided in her more than
he had seen fit to confide in me before
i had in fact become his son-in-law
her hand held mine as we continued
dropping into the canyon we
struck the bottom as lightly as
feathers and lona leading both of
us running awkwardly because of the
impediment of our monopters ap-
proached a tunnel-like opening in the
bottom floor of the executive build-
ing this was the closest i had been
in all my life to ground level and
we still were going down

  inside the tunnel we ran into
darkness we dropped into ebon
space and our monopters were auto-
matically in use again then we
were in the cavernlike immensities of

the level of the menials and i had
set foot on the soil of earth for the
first time in all my days the first of
all my family so to do for genera-
tions but there was no time to
think of this now for lona was
running again leading me swiftly
with her among the nude people who
were the menials bowing and bend-
ing toiling and steaming in perspira-
tion as they labored with the soil to
make it bring forth fruit for food i
had no opportunity then to observe
what they did for lona was leading
me to one of those slender piles about
which i had been told-one of those
piles which support the great ram-
part which is the floor of city of the
east she opened a door set flush
with the surface of the slender pil-
ing and we were in the pilings
heart

  see cried lona sark dar-
lin dead though he may be now was
still too far-sighted to be caught as
they thought to catch him here in
miniature is a keyboard of communi-
cation which is an exact duplicate of
that in father sarks office-a du-
plicate whose secret daddy gave me
only yesterday gerd sota you are
now the chief administrator of city
of the east give your orders

  i am thankful looking back upon
that moment that i acted with-
out hesitation i doffed my head-
piece and took my stand before the
myriad-faced board of communica-
tion-ticked my frenzied message
forth into space it was a message
to the nearest station of the invisible
frontier and it was a command that
a single one of the invisible rays be
directed into the heart of the black
cloud which hovered over executive
building when i had finished the
message i turned to lona feeling a
certain pride in my own ability but
lona was nowhere to be seen
frightened i stepped to the door and
called her name but no one an-
swered the menials some of them
the invading horde



looked dully up from their tasks for
a moment but a sharply snarled oath
from me caused their eyes to fall a
member of the upper levels does not
allow the menials to gaze upon his
face-it is the law

  then from directly above lona
settled to the earth beside me

  i went up to rampart level
she told me breathlessly and i was
right about the cloud i reached the
bottom of street-canyon just as the
ray was turned upon it i couldnt
see the ray of course but i could
see the effect for the cloud vanished
in a breath and tongues of fire filled
the air where it had been out of
the fire fell a single monopter like
no monopter in city of the east but
larger than any three of them and
marked in motley colors like the
costume of an ancient clown it
crashed to the ground quite near
where i stood and three men mere
blackened cinders so that i could not
tell the color of their faces rolled
from it i ran and looked at them-
each one held in his blackened fingers
a slender tube these three tubes
whatever powerful agency they may
have contained were i am sure the
inventions which wrought such havoc
with executive building

  but lona i objected how
could the monopter have got through
invisible frontier

 it didnt come through the
frontier she retorted i am sure
it came from the other way else one
of our people at the frontier is a
traitor which i  never believe
that submarine brought it just as it
brought those tiny submarines which
caused the breach in the great
rampart the big submarine must
have emerged far out to sea to dis-
charge the monopter and the monop-
ter hiding itself in a cloud of its own
making floated over the city some
way which we may never learn its
occupants kept in contact with a
common leader inside the submarine

so that the leader was informed of
the proper moment to make his at-
tack ugh imagine it gerd sota
an evil monopter traveling in its
own cloud high above even air lane
 emitting its self-concealing
blackness like a giant squid that has
left the water suddenly and grown
wings then at the proper moment
the attack god beloved daddy
sark

 it had been too much for lona
darlin even as i once more re-
moved her headpiece she swooned in
my arms and i bore her inside the
room of the board c communication
with the two monopters hers and
mine whose material is soft as eider-
down i prepared her a pallet on the
floor i laid her down covering her
with cloths which i found at hand
then knowing that a good rest
would be the best thing in the world
for her and that she would waken
when nature willed it burdened only
by the natural sorrow caused by the
loss of her beloved father-i seated
myself before the board of communi-
cation and began to send forth my
messages

to comm-andcr of the air

those which are of the patrol service

weird tales

monopter indicated in orders from me giv-
ing location and direction-reading

                                   sota

to chief of interior administration

  satisfy yourself that there are no
traitors in the corps which has charge of
the invisible frontier report results

                                   sota

  this last i sent in the code always
used in communication with city of
the easts secret service a code which
sark darlin had taught me i was
proud of the fact that i was able to
send in the code from memory

  these orders sent forth i con-
nected the phones of my monopter
with the receiver of the board of
communication and satisfied that any
message would waken me instantly
flung myself down with my head
against the beloved feet of lona
ears attuned to the tympanum of the
phones and slept the sleep of utter
exhaustion



it was lona who wakened me she
had slipped into her monopter
again and had mine straightened for
use there was utter silence inside
the piling not even the monotonous
humming of the machinery used by
the menials coming through to us
an ominous silence yet no message
had come over the wires if any-
thing had happened outside in city
of the east no warning had reached
us yet i knew upon waking that
something was wrong so did lona
for she was as pale as chalk as she
faced me in the pale light of the
dimmed incandescents which lighted
the room inside the piling

  look gerd she ejaculated
pointing at the board of communica-
tion

  then i realized why no alarm had
reached me and cursed myself deep-
ly for having jeopardized city of the
east for the sake of a bit of sleep
but the sleeping had saved my life
for i had turned in my sleep and

because my phones were fastened
tightly in place my turning had
pulled the connection of the phones
with the board of communication it
had saved my life i repeat for the
board of communication was nothing
but a twisted mass of metal the
myriads of wires were fused together
in a single ugly mass and the wood
of the board was as black as coal
the board of communication was use-
less-and i had been asleep what
had happened none of the officials
knew the location of this second
board of communication and they
might have been trying for hours to
arouse me for the purpose of asking
for orders anything might have
happened because of my negligence

  there was no time to waste with
lonas hand in mine since i needed
her strength and womans courage i
stepped out of the room lona led
the way to the opening in the great
rampart through which we must rise
to first story level but as we went
another and more terrible revelation
burst upon me

  something ghastly had befallen the
menials

  i could only guess how many there
were of them but as far as the eye
could reach in all directions massed
against the slender pilings grouped
here and there in all sorts of con-
torted positions not a nude figure
moved sightless eyes gazed straight
at the ceiling glassily staring while
faces were contorted into masks of
horror unimaginable one man a
brown one had clasped his hands at
his own throat and the grip still
held in death so powerful that the
tongue swollen and discolored pro-
truded from between teeth which
glistened like snarling fangs an-
other man lay doubled in such a way
that his face was almost against his
own nude loins and the veins on his
neck stood out like cords dead
menials by scores and hundreds
slain swiftly before they could at-
the invading horde



tempt escape stricken down in the
positions in which the unknown agent
of death had found them

  what had slain the menials and
why had they been slain

 the reason was obvious-the
menials who did the work of city of
the east had been slain in order that
not a wheel of commerce should turn
throughout all the city-and the
agency which had destroyed them
had been created for the very pur-
pose it had served-and the menials
had perished

  but how

  it came in a flash then the
menials were nude and only the nude
had perished horror-stricken i
bent and examined one of the
laborers

  weird unknown rays that was
the answer-rays which aeted only
upon nude flesh for just below the
breast-bone of each contorted corpse
indelibly etched in the flesh was a
brownish circle perhaps two inches in
diameter-much like the light circle
a small flashlight makes upon an
opaque object when held close to that
object the flesh inside the circle
was burned to a crisp turning one
corpse over i found a similar circle
on the back bisected by the spinal
column the ray had pierced the
nude body

  i shuddered with horror those
little submarines the breach in the
rampart and men countless men
from city of the west passing
among the menials with those grue-
some little flashlights in their hands

  lona and i had eseaped because
they had not found us now i un-
derstood the silence and why the
machinery of the menials was
motionless that machinery is or
was operated by electricity and such
of it as i could see as we hurried
through the contorted forms in the
direction of the opening upon first
floor level had suffered the fate of
the board of communication twisted

metal wood black as cinders useless
junk in all the level of the menials
was a chaos of twisted wires fused
and odorous twisted and contorted
human bodies a vast mausoleum
which made me understand some-
thing of the ruthless power of the
agency we were combating and
something of the horror we might yet
expect what would we find in the
upper levels had while we slept
the same mysterious agency which
had slain the menials made a holo-
caust of city of the east it was un-
thinkable

  but there was no time to lose it
takes time to tell but scarce two
minutes could have elapsed after my
wakening before lona and i once
more stood at the first story level

       of the east was as light as
 day and the catastrophe which
had fallen upon the menials had
thrown all city of the east into
turmoil great searchlights played
across the heavens their diverging
rays crossing and recrossing their
varied colors creating a kaleidoscope
more brightly tinted than the great-
est rainbow imagine the wonder of
it a city of a million spires and
turrets of a million buildings whose
crests were in the clouds buildings
which formed a city of the east
whose boundaries were the missis-
sippi on the west the atlantic on the
east and the regions of cold and heat
to the north and south a city
divided into sections each of which
comprized no more than two square
city blocks each of which was part of
a still larger section which was
roughly five miles square-and each
of the lesser sections equipped with
powerful searchlights uncountable
searchlights of a myriad of colored
beams each playing across its allotted
portion of the midnight sky

  city of the east vast and im-
measurable in the human mind was
the abode of terror unutterable for
cog

weird tales

attack had been delivered from an
unexpected quarter and countless
lives had been lost i looked upward
at the flight after flight of the aerial
patrols close-mustered specks in the
sky at air lane  and the
lights from the searchlights gilded
their monopters eerily so that they
seemed like monster moths with sun-
light glinting on their wings swift
darting moths patrolling all the sky

  lona and i turned westward
speeding at the ultimate limit of our
monopters for the invisible frontier
this could easily be seen now for
where the lights from the darting
searchlight-wedges encountered the
invisible frontier the beams broke
short off so that the wall invisible
as i knew it to be was indicated by a
night-black mass through which even
the beams of the searchlights could
not penetrate even light disinte-
grated and refused to penetrate the
wall of the rays

  though we looked as far as we
could in both directions the black
wall seemed endless and we flew for
several miles parallel to it to satisfy
ourselves that there was no breach
an eery experience if you will for
we could not see the apparatus which
directed the rays just an ebon wall
against the west as though it had
been the edge of the absolute dark-
ness of outer space-and silence
satisfied that there was no breach
along the invisible frontier lona
and i turned back toward the at-
lantic and since air lane  was
dteserted we flew with the speed of
the hurricane

  from this height we could see little
of city of the east so far below us
for our eyes were blirfded by the
glare of the myriad of lights which
blazoned the heavens through which
we sped through yellow light now
now through blue now through pale
green we fled into the east i was
now in communication with the com-
mander of the air two black clouds

he told me had been dispersed at his
orders when he had been unable to
communicate with us two black
clouds which had apparently hung
motionless at least ten thousand feet
above air lane  he had or-
dered the nearest of the ray stations
of the invisible frontier to disperse
these clouds which had been done in-
stantly-and out of each had fallen a
single huge monopter huge that is
in comparison with our own monop-
ters to plummet downward into the
heart of city of the east

  i had an idea whence the clouds
came

  am heading out over the at-
lantic i wirelessed the commander
keep your wave-length adjusted
for contact lona darlin is with me
obey orders sent by either of us
keep a sharp lookout on the invisible
frontier if the searchlights pene-
trate it at any point let me know at
once  

  then i severed connections and
lona and i hurtled onward into the
east

jcor the second time in twenty-four
 hours we could see dimly it is
true and then only with the aid of
powerful night glasses the outline of
the great rampart we could not
see it until we had left the shoreline
several miles behind because of the
searchlights but when it did become
visible i began to get some idea of the
terrible thing that we faced before
mountainous waves of water had
crashed against the great rampart
along a distance of little more than
five miles a local storm artificially in-
duced in some way by the big sub-
marine now a storm so vast in
comparison as to dwarf that other
into insignificance crashed against
the great rampart the roar was so
vast that its very volume caused loaia
and me holding hands to keep from
being separated to be tossed to and
fro like chips in a mill-race no
the invading horde



threat of destruction to a mere five
miles of rampart this time for the
storm was visible to right and left as
far as we could see

  it might have extended along the
whole length of the great rampart
as i believed and later verified that
it did but outward from the coast-
line a mere ten miles the ocean was
as untroubled as a pond-and for an
excellent reason

  side by side each in contact with
its neighbor to right and left sub-
marines only less vast than the first
we had seen pointed their steel noses
at the great rampart  no beams as
from searchlights came from their
decks and i knew that lona and i
had not been seen-yet this was a
terrible danger into which i was tak-
ing her had i tried to send her
back she would not have understood
my reason for so doing besides
which i wished her with me even
though both of us lost our lives

  submarines afloat abreast their
noses pointed at the great rampart
an attack was imminent but how
would it be delivered it would be
useless to charge the great rampart
even with metal monsters as vast as
these what then

  i was soon to know as before we
had seen the tiny submarines dart
back from the artifically created
maelstrom before the great rampart
we saw them drop back again but
multiplied in numbers by the number
of the big submarines which had
lined up offshore to begin the
offensive

  here is where i made the mistake
which was to prove the ruin of city
of the east for i sent a message to
the commander of the air to clear the
city immediately of all inhabitants
ordering them to the unmapped ways
above air lane  i knew the
monopters could do it under pres-
sure though it would be a terrible
strain on the nervous systems of the
flyers and many must of necessity

fall by the wayside sacrifice the
weak that the strong might live-it
seemed sensible reasoning to me in
view of its stark necessity

  looking back after receiving the
acknowledgment of the commander
of the air i saw the monopters rising
from city of the east in veritable
clouds not until the space below
air lane  had become empty
of aught save the beams of the
mighty searchlights whose operators
were left behind at their posts-and
i knew that the inhabitants who were
able had been herded into the spaces
above air lane  did i realize
how neatly i had been tricked the
commander then of this barrier of
big submarines had known all the
time that lona and i were above
them but had been subtle in his
reasoning beyond imagining it
proved he had known of our presence
that other time too when the one big
submarine had wrought such havoc
with the great rampart from my
actions then he had reasoned out my
own probable line of reasoning and
i had done exactly what he had
figured that i would do

  for no explosion occurred no new
breach showed in the great rampart
the commander of the invaders had
worked a ruse the like of which had
never before been encountered in the
annals of modern warfare-and i
had fallen into the trap how well
i knew it when the next episode
occurred

  from the giant submarine directly
below where lona and i hung in the
air watching shot a great funnel of
blinding light a funnel or inverted
cone with its apex at the point of de-
parture broadening as it lifted to
our place in the sky so that the light
was all about us but it was different
from the lights which the city of the
east used for we could see through
the sides of the cone around which
we circled like moths in a mighty
lamp chimney unable to get through


weird tales

because of something inherent in the
strange light which dashed us back
when we would have gone through
dashed us back as effectually as a
stone wall would have done holding
us prisoners inside the gleaming cone

  but we could see-great god we
could see and in the hour or so be-
fore the end i realized to the full the
catastrophe my lack of reasoning my
lack of experience with the minds of
men had brought upon city of the
east i understand now the reason
of that hint i had caught in the
voice of sark darlin when he had
told me i must become worthy to be
the leader in affairs of city of the
east i had failed and moving
about the sides of the cone seeking
a way out i suffered such torments as
no man before me has ever suffered
and i hope as no man may ever
suffer in the future-for i could see

 s though at a signal the under-
sea hatches of the countless sub-
marines opened and were flung back
and as the bees must have come forth
when pandora opened the box came
forth in swarms and myriads the
monopters of the invaders now i
realized too where even sark darlin
had been shortsighted he had
never known of these submarines of
the people of the west feeling no
doubt that the invisible frontier
made it unnecessary for him to send
spies and secret agents into the coun-
try of the aliens he had taken it
for granted that city of the east
was far in advance of the aliens in
point of inventions and the para-
phernalia of warfare-a great mis-
take we had not needed to make
war and were caught unprepared
the aliens had been preparing for
war for generations building their
monopters and submarines on the
west coast so far away that not even
a whisper of warning had reached us
then when everything was ready for
the greatest offensive in history the

long voyage down the coast in the
fleet after fleet of metal amphibians
the unbelievable walk across the nar-
row neck of the isthmus the plunge
into the atlantic and the lining up
of the monsters before the great
rampart of city of the east

  but my own mistake had been far
greater yet after all what could i
have done i am sure they would
have beaten us in any case and our
people would have worked out their
lives in slavery instead of meeting
the merciful death  which was their
portion because of my mistake yet
i feel that i shall go into eternity
with oceans and oceans of blood upon
my soul i might have done some-
thing

  but it was too late now i knew it
when watching from the cone desir-
ing above all things to lose the power
to watch because of the frightfulness
i saw those myriads of monopters
swarm from the hatches of the metal
monsters and advance upon city of
the east by thousands but stay
there was still the invisible frontier
i could communicate with the depart-
ment heads of the invisible frontier
and tell them to turn their rays
across the top of the city for fore-
seeing the time when this very move
might become necessary sark darlin
had caused ray reflectors to be
erected on certain lines above the
city so that the rays might be bent
to follow the curvature of the earth
leaping the gaps between the lines of
reflectors with the mathematical
nicety which only a genius like sark
could have managed it would be
better to ruin the buildings for they
could be built up again than for
those huge monopters to swarm up
in a surprize attack against our
people all of them now in the highest
air lane and above if i hurried i
could have an invisible barrier built
up between our people and the up-

fkom across the lake clearly
and with eery distinctness
through the stillness of the
night came the fearsome notes of a
hungry timber wolf trailing some
straining panting deer

  startled i leaned forward my
pipe cold between my teeth and lis-
tened to the hellish music of that
tawny demon of the woods

  the eager savage hunting cry
changed suddenly to a demoniac
psean of victory broke into a slaver-
ing yapping-and then the pulsing
silence settled down on us once more

  got her i said giving voice in-
voluntarily to my thoughts

  george nodded gravely

  the timbers seldom miss making
their kill he remarked thought-

fully its no wonder the people

of olden times used to believe-

  hello the camp the ringing
unexpected hail from the dark lake
caused us both to start like fright-
ened children the weird hunting
cry of a timber wolf does things to
the nerves of even the men who spend
all their days in the bush

  our visitors proved to be two in
number the first a tall chap in the
uniform of the provincial police
who introduced himself as tieg mc-
donald and a tall slender man with
a professional beard and black rest-
less eyes whom mcdonald introduced
as dr saunders

  it was instantly evident from their
attitudes that the doctor was mcdon-
alds prisoner but aside from the

                                  


weird tales

fact that the doctor carried no
weapons of any kind there was noth-
ing tangible to indicate the fact

  dr saunders was in a pitifully
nervous state his eyes roving con-
stantly searching the surrounding
blackness with an intense and never-
resting gaze that bordered on the in-
sane glare of a madman when he
spoke his voice was jerky and high-
pitched and although his remarks
were utterly rational it was easy to
see that he was near the breaking
point mcdonald kept a cautious eye
on his prisoner at all times but i
somehow caught the impression that
there was more of pity than stern-
ness in his regard

  for some time we chatted quite
casually and then i dropped a re-
mark that proved to be a bomb-shell

  the timbers are ranging south
early this year   i said   i suppose
you heard that big boy-

  god groaned the doctor in the
voice of a damned soul will i
never get away from the voice of
those hellish beasts

  thats all right doc said the
big policeman soothingly theres
three of us here to see that no wolf
comes around the camp then
mcdonald turned to us doc had
a mighty bad experience up on ten-
nelip bay he exclaimed ran up

against a mad wolf-

  no cried the doctor his wild
eyes searching our faces no it
was not a mad wolf it was not i
tell you listen and i will tell you
myself all that happened we

were-

    it  get you all nerved up to tell
the story again doc interrupted
mcdonald better turn in and get
some sleep eh

  no i want to tell these men also
and see what they think returned
the doctor stubbornly you think
i am mad mcdonald i am not blind
you know

  the policeman colored a little

under his bronze but he simply
shrugged his mighty shoulders and
said nothing

tt was this way began dr

  l saunders as calmly as though he
were about to relate the most com-
monplace event i came up into
the woods on a long hunting trip
seeking not so much a trophy as my
health my practise had worn me
down in body and mind and i knew
from experience that a month or so
up here in the bush would make an-
other man of me

  i made the decision to come and
left that same night trusting to
chance to find an outfitter and a
guide after i got to the jumping-off
place there had been a lot of hunt-
ers this year however and the only
guide i could find was a french-
indian breed known only as victor
he had not been long in the country
and i gathered that he was pretty
generally hated and mistrusted but
he had trapped last year in the very
country i wished to hunt in and so
i took him

  he was surly silent and at times
almost savage but had a most un-
canny knack of finding his way in the
bush and of locating game i saw
him discover game on several occa-
sions when it seemed that only the
power of scent could have served
him once or twice upon awaking
late at night i found him missing
from the tent and always the follow-
ing mornings he was more sullen and
morose than ever however i am
silent by nature myself and my
guides disposition while it caused
me some wonderment gave me no
concern whatever most of these
men of the bush are odd characters

  one night we were sitting around
our fire just as we are sitting here
now it was very dark without even
a star showing through the heavy
clouds overhead i had become
weary of my own thoughts and gave
the wolf



the brooding victor a verbal poke to
see if i could not rouse him

   i heard old man martin down
at the post giving some of the fel-
lows the very devil for telling stories
of werewolves in this country i re-
marked casually i knew very well
that victor would be possessed of all
the superstitions of his breed and
that old martin and victor were bit-
ter personal enemies but i was utter-
ly unprepared for the sudden hatred
that flared up in victors eyes

  across the fire i saw my guides
deep-set eyes light up with sudden
hatred

    martin he ees a fool he
ees crack he ees a child the secon
time who is he to laugh at better
men i ask you

   then you think there are were-
wolves in this country i asked
amused god help me at the sud-
den ferocity of the man

   how can one know for sure
shrugged victor my own people
the french-lie was about one
thirty-second french the rest being
several breeds of indian-they say
for sure that there be werewolves i
have met men who have seen them
where there ees so much sign there
must be game ees eet not so
m sieuv he smiled ingratiatingly
revealing flashing white teeth be-
neath his stiff and bristling mustache

  i sent a cloud of tobacco smoke
swirling through the chill night air
and watched it merge with the hurry-
ing wreaths from the fire

   bosh i rejoined more for the
purpose of seeing what he would say
than for any great interest in the
matter under discussion were-
wolves have long since been proven
nothing but myths victor only
ignorant people believe in such
things these days

  i was surprized at the effect of
my words victors dark eyes lit up
with a peculiar flickering light such
as i had never before seen except in

animals the kind of weird green
glint you see in the eyes of a dog or
a cat at night his eyes narrowed
until they were scarcely more than
evil slits and his thin red lips drew
away from his gleaming teeth until
his face was utterly bestial in its ex-
pression of demoniac insane hatred

   msieu thinks so he asked and
his voice was low and silky like the
purring of a cat or the soft guttural
notes of a fawning dog well
msieu should know he ees edu-
cate and i am but a poor french
bushman and he stalked off into
the darkness toward the tent

  i started to apologize as i had
not meant to offend the man but he
was gone oh well i thought let
him turn in and sulk if he wanted to
i would finish my pipe anyway be-
fore following him i leaned back
comfortably against a big tree and
watching the weaving tongues of yel-
low and red lost myself in revery

  my thoughts drifted into many
channels almost i was dozing when
suddenly sharp and clear as the note
of a bugle on a winter morning the
hunting cry of a wolf shivered
through the night silence once
twice three times the eery hellish
call cut through the air something
maniacal something threatening
something exultant something plead-
ing in the long undulating notes
despite myself i shivered and drew
closer to the glowing coals

   hear the wolf victor i called
to my guide to break the uncanny
silence that followed the challenge of
the wolf

  there was no answer

  victor i cried sharply sud-
denly apprehensive only palpi-
tant silence answered me

  i scrambled to my feet and ran
to the tent it was empty victor
had disappeared

  suddenly the banshee wailing of
the wolf again splintered the deathly
stillness it was nearer now much


weird tales

nearer it came racing down a long
slope then ran up back of the camp
evidently headed directly toward me

  t t astily i piled dry wood on the

  rl dying fire the fresh fuel
smoldered a moment and then little
tongues of eager flame began licking
through all the time the demoniac
bugling of the wolf was becoming
louder fiercer was drawing ever
nearer was the animal crazy
what little breeze there was was
blowing directly toward him and
surely he must have scented the
camp and where had victor gone
while i napped and why had he
gone had he deserted me as
indian guides not infrequently do

  these and a hundred other ques-
tions flitted through my mind as i
fed the fire and fanned it eagerly
until it blazed no wild animal i
knew would come close to a fire
carefully i piled the pitchy wood
and in a minute or two the flames
were leaping high into the overhang-
ing darkness spilling red light liko
blood over the rocky ground and
setting a thousand shadows spring-
ing and dancing like ghoulish imps

    the threatening savage cry of
the foraging wolf stopped suddenly
and a hushed expectant silence set-
tled down over the woods even the
lap-lapping of the water on the shore
a few yards away seemed to die to an
inaudible murmur

   old boy changed his mind i
chuckled fire is the one tiling-

  there was soft rustle in the
bushes just behind me i gave a
startled exclamation and turned
sharply in my tracks there not two
yards away a pair of blazing green
eyes were watching me narrowly
even as i turned they came slowly
unwinkingly nearer

  i jumped for my rifle it was
leaning against a tree on the other
side of the fire i remembered
putting it there where i would be

sure to see and clean it before i
turned in i knew just where it was
-and yet when i reached for it it
was gone frantically thinking it
might have fallen down i looked
around for it it was not there and
across from me on the other side of
the fire a huge tawny timber wolf
stalked into the circle of fire and
stood with its malevolent green eyes
fixed unwinkingly upon me

  the brute was larger than any
timber wolf i had ever seen or heard
of and much darker in color the
lips were curled in a hellish carica-
ture of a smile and a low snarl came
from its slavering mouth for one
long moment i eyed the brute and it
eyed me back and then suddenly
through the leaping flames and the
showering sparks the monster sprang
for me

   instinctively i crouched protect-
ing my throat the movement was
the only thing that saved me for the
long white fangs sank into the fleshy
part of my upflung forearm des-
perately i threw myself upon the
writhing beast my hands seeking his
throat useless useless the beast
unloosed his hold  my arm and
reached for my throat i leaped
backward as quickly as i could and
the shining cruel teeth clicked sav-
agely together not an inch from their
mark

  snarling with rage the animal
sprang again but as he did so a sud-
den thought struck me and i cursed
explosively why hadnt i thought
of my revolver before hastily i
snatched it from its holster under my
arm and as the wolf flung at my
throat i fired

  the result was instantaneous a
look of fear blazed suddenly in the
smoky green eyes and the beast
seemed to stop its leap in midair
before i eould fire a second time the
wolf had disappeared into the shad-
ows of the surrounding forest
the wolf



  it was limping badly its left hind
leg being apparently badly hurt and
in the firelight i saw several drops
of blood gleaming blackly on the
rocks at my feet

t made no effort to follow the ani-
mal i was exhausted with my
terrible struggle and my brain was
throbbing dizzily with excitement i
am no hero and that great beast big-
ger than any wolf and with a light
of hellish intelligence burning in its
eyes had chilled the very blood of
me weakly with a little trembling
sigh of relief i seated myself beside
the fire

  a moment later i started appre-
hensively something was coming

through the bush was it-f a

familiar voice hailed me from the
darkness it was victor

  smiling his teeth gleaming white-
ly under his black mustache victor
came up to the fire

   msieu is awake eh he re-
marked i have been out hunting
for a wolf that i hear while msieu
sleeps i am so bold as to take the
gun but sacre of the wolf i do not
even catch sight shrewd ones those
wolves msieu he was smiling
amiably but as his glance met mine
i would have sworn there was some-
thing mocking in the depths of his
dark eyes and for an instant it
seemed that they gleamed with smoky
green fire

   i saw him i remarked shortly
he attacked me

   so exclaimed victor in sur-
prize the wolf he attack you
here by the fire eet ees imposs
 impossible or not he did just
that i declared i shot and
wounded him or he would have torn
my throat out only hit him in the
leg but that was enough

   and tomorrow we will be back
in town eet ees too bad you have
not the time to stay so we could hunt
heem  said victor a peculiar note

in his voice even though you do
laugh at the werewolves of my fa-
thers you would like to shoot a
timber wolf ees eet not so

  again the smoky green light
seemed to flicker in his eyes a
thousand tumultuous impossible
thoughts swirled through my brain
the smile on victors face seemed to
turn to a menacing grin like the
snarling visage of a wolf    with
gleaming white fangs    slavering
jaws-

  some instinct caused me to look
down victor followed the direction
of my glance with a smile half of
fear half of hatred

  his left leg from the knee down
was covered with blood

   it was in the left leg that i shot
the wolf i said musingly almost
unaware that i was thinking aloud

   and eet ees the left leg that i
hurt when i fell in the dark
smiled victor eet ees what you call
a coo-incident ees eet not msieu
something eet ees hard to believe
and he chuckled mockingly trium-
phantly

  my overwrought nerves gave way
then i felt something snap out of
place up here-the doctor indicated
his head with a vague gesture-
and a dizzy light-headed feeling
swept over me

  i remember seeing victor as
through a bloody fog across the fire
but his face had changed to the face
of a wolf-the wolf that had leaped
through the flames straight for my
throat

  i think i shouted something as i
drew my revolver and fired at that
leering caricature of a human face
i am a good shot and i did not miss
for victor crumpled in his tracks

  the doctor paused for a moment
and stared moodily into the fire

  i do not remember just what hap-
pened after that he resumed after
a few minutes during which none of


weird tales

us broke the oddly strained silence
i left victor where he fell i think
and paddled to one of the fishing
camps on the lake mr mcdonald
happened to be there and he con-
sented to take me back with him i
guess gentlemen that is all my story
do you think i am mad as mr mc-
donald does i am sure or do you
think that i know what i saw
with a pitiful eagerness he glanced
from one face to another

  george was the first to speak

  i think doctor that you have
had a most unusual experience he
said thoughtfully and i think
shakespeare was indeed right in say-
ing that there are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamt of
in the philosophy of most of us

  i nodded that is undoubtedly
so doctor was the only remark i
could think of although i knew in

bathed in mystery and moonlight
wistfully it stands
at the end of a lonely winding road
where cobwebs hang in strands
of dusty lace an old ghost hung
before a sagging door-

and winds go moaning through the
    rooms

  with fog from down the moor

never a light-nor sound nor laugh-
  never a footfall-wait

what was that-did i hear a step
  down by the creaking gate

echoes resounding in empty halls-
shadows that spring like cats-
sudden drafts that seem like breaths
and a fluttering of bats

my heart of course that the doctor
was a madman

  it was not until after the doctor
had retired that i learned the rest of
the story it was mcdonald who
threw the last light on the strange
tale the doctor had told

  the funny thing about it re-
marked mcdonald as we were smok-
ing a last pipe around the fire is
that when i went back to the doctors
camp victor had two bullet holes in
his body one through the leg and
one through the head and the one
through the leg was tightly bandaged
with a blood-soaked handkerchief-
and to the wound were sticking a
number of black and yellow hairs-
wolf hairs

met lee clayton in rome the
attraction was a mutual one for
we discovered that we had much
in common both students of history
fond of travel and possessing an in-
satiable thirst for the uncovering of
forgotten and apparently insignifi-
cant historical data that might
throw light upon questions of dis-
pute

  at the end of three weeks we had
covered the city of the seven hills
from the flaminian to the appian
way reveling especially in those
relics that gave us any knowledge
of the dead past dead can the
past ever really die  i believed and

i think my friend clayton agreed
with me that the past lives today
it is immortal but in its changed
form it is manifest in influence and
posterity these two in a stream of
continuity render the antiquity of
rome a vital fact in the twentieth
century a d

  one warm evening clayton and i
returned to the hotel veranda after
an interesting day among the ruins
of the roman forum to our ears
came the characteristic sounds of
italian life a snatch of song in melo-
dious tenor a sharp staccato excla-
mation the rumble of cab wheels
over cobblestones and the occasional

                                  


weird tales

bleating of goats whose milk sup-
plied the native quarter to our
right the yellow thread of the tiber
was faintly visible

  clayton smiled understandingly
and waved a hand toward the streets
below as he sank luxuriously into a
comfortable chair

  great thing for a rest ebson
he remarked its a change from
the hurry and bustle of the average
american city i like it

  yes i agreed and a change
always means rest although we
are both young weve been living
strenuously in a modern business
world and cant help appreciating
the contrast

  we sat for some time in silence
the while i noticed claytons fea-
tures displaying a growing pensive
mood his former joviality was dis-
appearing i made no attempt to
encourage conversation for i felt
that it would come when the time
was ripe

  friend ebson said lee clayton
at length dropping his listless mien
and leaning toward me for many
years the repetition of a certain
dream has troubled me the vision
first appeared when i was in high
school and followed me throughout
my entire college career its vivid-
ness increasing with the passing of
the years it pertains to the solu-
tion of the mystery surrounding the
ambiguous expression in the greek
latin and jewish scripts where the
incendiary of the temple of jerusa-
lem is invariably referred to as a
certain soldier in my constantly
recurring dream i seem continually
on the verge of discovering the iden-
tity of this certain soldier but al-
ways i awake just before solving the
mystery my trip upon this occa-
sion to the eternal city is to find
out if possible who threw the flam-
ing torch into the temple at jerusa-
lem when the legions of titus took
the city of the jews if it is ever

possible to bring my haunting dream
to a consummation it should be here
amid the relies of its original enact-
ment

  i must have gazed at him incred-
ulously for he continued hastily
in all sincerity i mean what i say
my friend either here or in jeru-
salem i should be able to ascertain
the identity of that certain soldier
who threw a lighted torch into a
window of the sanctuary why
man alive think of the responsibility
of that act

  had the heat of a semi-tropic sun
or the fatigue of daily sight-seeing
affected my friends mind i hesitat-
ed before voicing a mild rebuke and
in that moment of pause the spirit
of adventure tempered with toler-
ance for the incomprehensible whims
of another possessed me my an-
swer must have surprized him

  theres a quest worthy of some
time and effort i answered with
more enthusiasm than i really felt
the forum romanum has already
disclosed to us a few of its secrets
and why not this one well show
the world yet that tacitus and jose-
phus and a few others of the an-
cients didnt get exactly the right
dope on all this

  my light mood did not affect clay-
ton he continued seriously his
eyes showing a dreamy expression

  you must remember the histo-
rians josephus and tacitus were
both contemporaries of titus-and
-and this certain soldier they
had first-hand evidence and certain-
ly ought to have been more explicit
in their details as a matter of
fact he added they are more eva-
sive in their narrations of the events
connected with the siege of jerusa-
lem of which they must have been
eye-witnesses than they are regard-
ing historical occurrences preceding
their era

  yes that is strange i agreed
how do you account for it
a certain soldier



  clayton was about to reply when
i noticed that a pallor spread over
his features and he leaned forward
with eyes intent upon the hotel en-
trance following the direction of
his gaze i saw the well-tailored back
of a gentleman disappearing through
the doorway i turned with a glance
of inquiry to my friend his manner
showed agitation and i did not press
him for the explanation which i
knew would be forthcoming shortly

    that man   clayton explained in
a husky voice is an enemy-and
possibly not without reason he
added reflectively two years ago
i was fortunate enough to win as my
wife the girl whom we both loved
shortly afterward the company in
which we were both financially inter-
ested elected me to the presidency
a position to which each of us had
aspired since that time my dear
wife died-but the business concern
in which that man and i are mutual-
ly interested is prospering although
my two victories have been won sole-
ly by fair means the man whom
you saw disappearing within the
doorway has proved a determined
enemy whose obsession is to avenge
his defeat in love and war  

  i was a little disquieted though i
sought to cover my uneasiness with
cheering words

  never mind old chap we are
living in the twentieth century no
one can stoop to revenge in these
days and get away with it now if
we were living in  a d for in-
stance you might have cause for
alarm life was held pretty cheap
at the time titus laid siege to jeru-
salem and one had to live warily
but things are different now

  he smiled wanly speaking of
titus lets begin tomorrow to solve
the mystery of the certain soldier
agreed i replied heartily
im in my element when it comes
to finding an explanation for the in-
explicable



sleep seemed to have forsaken me
completely that night the full
moon shining in at my window
caused me to abandon all further
thought of rest i arose dressed my-
self and stood gazing out across the
silvery landscape the moonlight
softened objects below that in the
glare of day stood out in too bold
relief

  i stood for some time in a troubled
and hesitant mood

  why not i exclaimed half
aloud

  once resolved upon my course of
action i sought the streets below
without eliciting any surprize from
the sleepy concierge at the desk
the streets were silent and deserted
the pavement echoing with the ring
of my footfall until it seemed to me
that all rome must be apprized of
my nocturnal sally soon i spied the
ancient grandeur of the colosseum
as it rose tier on tier above the stone
ruins and cypress trees that nestled
in its shadow i was approaching
the familiar territory of the once
busy mart of ancient rome the
arch of constantine rose before me
sublime in its architectural beauty
then i turned fascinated eyes down
to the ruins of the forum which lie
several feet below the level of the
present city

  i know it was surprize though not
untinged with fear that possessed
me as i became aware of the pres-
ence of another figure not fifty feet
ahead of me it was that of a man
and he was agilely descending the
steps to the lower level i instantly
recognized lee clayton and watched
him with fascinated gaze what
could the man be doing alone among
silent ruins in the dead of the night
then i thought of myself and my
own intentions and i nearly laughed
aloud well i would not spy on my
friend i quickened my pace with
the intention of making my presence


weird tales

known when further progress was
arrested by the changed demeanor of
lee clayton

  no longer did he walk as a man
alone but rather as one who wends
his way in and out among a crowd
occasionally he paused and gazed
fixedly at some object apparently
visible to him then his head turned
as though following the course of
something in motion

  the effect was most uncanny and
i pinched myself to make eertain i
was not asleep the somnambulist
if he were such strode with dignity
in the direction of the triumphal
arch of titus and there he paused
strange words were wafted to my
ears phrases in an unknown tongue
unknown had i studied latin for
six years not to recognize it when i
heard it even in this fashion occa-
sionally clayton paused apparently
to lay his hand upon the shoulder of
an invisible associate some of the
things he thought he heard were
mirth-provoking and his laughter
rang out weirdly shrill in the white
silence around us

  jumping jehosophat i ex-
claimed wiping my perspiring brow
with my handkeschief thats a
wow of a dream all right

  he must have heard me for he
looked in my direction and smiled as
if in friendly greeting tremblingly
i smiled back i racked my brain
for one intelligent sentence in latin

   all gaul is divided into three
parts wont do upon this occasion
i mumbled disconsolately

  the only other words that came to
my muddled brain were the latin
version of twinkle twinkle little
star  i tried them and was greeted
with a buret of uproarious laughter
from clayton the incongruity of
which at this time caused me to
tremble with fear ho said some-
thing about vinum nimium and then
turned his attention to the arch of
titus talking off and on the while

as if engaged in conversation with
many around him

  for an hour the apparent mono-
logue continued while i stood spell-
bound finally he turned abruptly
and proceeded in the direction of
the colosseum he strode so rapidly
that i had difficulty in keeping a de-
sirable distance behind him i in-
tended to see that he returned with-
out harm to his rooms at the hotel

  at the foot of the flight of steps
leading to the level of present-day
rome clayton paused and passed a
hand across his brow he gazed
about him in apparent bewilderment
and proceeded thereafter with the
air of a man in solitude

  thinking that possibly the knowl-
edge of a witness might cause him
some embarrassment i did not make
my presence manifest but allowed
him to retire to his aparfcnent before
entering the hotel myself

  was the true explanation of lee
claytons night expedition in any
way connected with the puzzling
dream of which he had told me
sleep claimed me for the few hours
that remained until dawn



the following morning found me
in bed at a late hour my vigi-
lance of the previous night had been
more fatiguing than i hadat the
time realized i lay for some time
pondering the enigma of my friends
behavior should i feign ignorance
of the occurrence in the forum or
would it be best to inform lee clay-
ton of what i knew unable to de-
cide the better course to pursue i
dressed and hastened down to break-
fast

  clayton was breakfasting alone in
a far comer of the dining salon as
i took the chair opposite him he
looked up with a smile of recognition
and passed across the table to me
an open volume which he had been
a certain soldier



perusing pointing to a paragraph
therein

 hebrew i ejaculated im
sorry but i dont know a word of
it

  then here is a rather free trans-
lation of it he replied but i re-
gret that you can not read the orig-
inal some of the authors thought
is always lost in the process of trans-
lation

  i accepted the proffered script and
read the following

  the secret of the identity of a certain
soldier who fired the sanctuary of the holy
temple of the jews lies buried in his bosom
an associate upon threat of exposure bids
him make record of his deed this he has
done but so obscurely that nearly twenty
centuries shall pass before the mystery
shall be made clear

  well thats beginning to get
close i commented returning the
paper to lee who was the old fel-
low that wrote that indicating the
volume

  that is not known lee clayton
replied turning to the title-page
it seems to be merely a collection
of anonymous hebrew manuscripts
published by a german house in the
early part of the sixteenth cen-
tury

 but why all the secrecy i
asked the certain soldier was
merely fulfilling destiny when he
obeyed an impulse to fire the sanc-
tuary

 young lee clayton shot me a
swift searching glance

  if you believe so he said quiet-
ly i will not gainsay it but if you
want my personal opinion the cer-
tain soldier was as indeed all of us
are the captain of his own soul he
was entirely responsible for his deed
you know shakespeare wrote

the fault dear brutus is not in our
      stars

but in ourselves that we are underlings

  what if he did i admitted
warming to the argument but if

i remember rightly he is also re-
sponsible for these words

theres a divinity that shapes our ends
  rough-hew them how we will

  how do you reconcile the two
clayton laughed pleasantly it
seems to be a case of pay your
money and take your choice friend
ebson and my choice is made and
is unchangeable

  i admire you for your convic-
tions i said heartily i confess
my own are not so unshakable  

  he smiled a little pensively then
remarked and because i believe
this certain soldier to have been en-
tirely responsible for his act of
desecration i wish to ascertain his
identity and now i am going to a
curio-shop which i chanced upon
yesterday will you come too

  i readily consented and together
we wended our way through the
busy streets of modern rome

not far from the piazza de spa-
nia near the end of a short and
narrow street lined with native ba-
zaars and stalls is a curio-shop of
one antonio salvueci dealer in an-
tiques although the place was far
from cleanly and had a very clut-
tered appearance it was not wholly
lacking in charm the proprietor
appeared from the rear of the shop
as we entered and eyed us apprais-
ingly

 the american gentlemen wish
some roman antiques questioned
the italian eagerly

  just looking mr salvucci re-
plied clayton and aside to me the
museums have most of the genuine
antiques but occasionally one can
pick up something god for very
little money

  we walked about the little store
looking at and inquiring about vari-
ous objects most of the curios were
relics of coptic art that had been
found in and about the catacombs


weird tales

 where the early christians had met
 secretly to escape persecution occa-
 sionally an object that dated back
 to the republic was seen but the
 majority were identified in some
 way with the period of romes
 downfall when attacked by the
 tribes from the north

   have you any relic of the time
- of vespasian or titus asked clay-
ton coming at last to the subject
that was nearest his heart

   titus-titus repeated the for-
 eigner as if trying to recall some
 long-forgotten fact wait i see

   he vanished through a rear door
 but reappeared some minutes later
 bearing in his arms a miniature
 restoration of the famous arch of
 titus which had been erected in
 honor of the roman conquest of
 jerusalem in  a d this fac-
 simile was two feet at its greatest
 length and the other dimensions
 were proportional

   we were delighted with our find
 but feigned indifference i per-
 ceived though that it was all lee
 could do to keep his hands off it

   what price do you ask i in-
 quired casually

   twenty-five dollar answered
 the italian promptly

   nothing doing i replied turn-
 ing toward the door ill give you
 five for it

   oh-but signor i have four
 bambini i must make a living he
 pleaded with characteristic italian
 pathos

   ill give you ten said clayton
 somewhat harshly

   the sale was eventually consum-
 mated at the sixteen-dollar figure
 and we bore our trophy away with
 exultation

   back in the hotel and safely en-
 sconced in lee claytons rooms we
 studied the little arch minutely it
 was a very perfect reproduction in
 pentelic marble like the original
 and showed a faithfulness to detail

that was nothing short of marvelous

  there were the faces in bas-relief
of titus the son of the emperor
vespasian a number of triumphant
roman warriors a line of jews in
bondage and a reproduction of the
seven golden candlesticks which had
been seized from the holy of holies
when the temple at jerusalem was
plundered the chiseling of the faces
was unique each one displaying its
characteristic individuality

 do you notice i observed
that the sculptor has differentiated
between the jews and the romans
the facial characteristics of each
race are quite in evidence

 yes-only-hold on a minute
ebson cried lee in excitement
hes made one error unless im
very much mistaken lies got a jew
among the victorious romans

  to be sure i exclaimed my
excitement equaling his own that
figure near the middle certainly be-
longs to the conquered race but
there were jews who were roman
citizens i added and the chances
are they were even more numerous
in  than in  a d 

 that is very true lee an-
swered a little abstractedly i
thought but it is very poor taste
for the artist to be so realistic in a
symbolic creation where compara-
tively few figures are represented i
think he showed decidedly bad
judgment-unless he added the
jew in question was a man of con-
siderable importance  

  that explanation sounds plau-
sible to me i said the toreh-
bearer is undoubtedly a man of
fame whose portrait is indispensable
to an accurate depiction of the tri-
umphal entry into rome



night and a full moon shedding its
ethereal light across the eternal
city prove a combination irresistible
to lovers of beauty and romance
a certain soldier



  lee clayton and i left the hotel
at sundown and wandered on the
roman campagna amid the vener-
able quietude of its ilex and cypress
trees the beauty and serenity of
the scene were not likely to be soon
forgotten when the moon hung
low we returned to the city seeking
that part which is rich in historic
associations we saw plashing
fountains old altars partly de-
molished statues of ancient origin
picturesque arches and shattered
pillars their outlines softened and
half concealed by flowers and vines

  after the moon had disappeared
we retraced our steps to the hotel

i had just locked my door prepara-
tory to retiring for the night when
i was forcibly impressed with a pos-
sible solution to the enigma of the
roman soldier who was a jew i
unlocked my door locking it again
behind me and stepped into the hall
there was light in lees room and
the door was slightly ajar i rapped
lightly but received no response
upon the center table stood the
small replica of the famous arch
and it seemed to me as i gazed rue-
fully at it that the handsome fea-
tures of the mysterious roman jew
regarded me with amusement not un-
touched with contempt

  i left the room and descended to
the first floor

  did mr clayton leave the
hotel i inquired of the desk-
clerk

  he passed this way just a mo-
ment ago the man replied

  my jnind was made up without -
a moments hesitation i left the
hotel and stepped into the quiet of a
semi-tropic night for an instant
my eyes unaccustomed to the dark-
ness saw nothing but gradually as
objects became faintly visible i dis-
cerned the figure of my friend as i
had seen him upon the previous
night striding rapidly toward the
site of the forum of ancient rome

  but his pace was too rapid for
me and i knew that unless i dashed
madly after him running the risk
of arousing suspicion i could not
hope to catch up with him instinc-
tively i retraced the route of the
night before in a breathless condi-
tion i espied the familiar ruins of
the great colosseum and the arch of
the first christian emperor con-
stantine flanking the mammoth pit
of the ancient forum wherein
clustered pillars like tombstones of
a bygone age gleamed palely

  fatigued to the point of exhaus-
tion i seated myself on a boulder
and mopped my perspiring brow
the night seemed to be growing
warmer-and a faint glow of suf-
fused light pervaded the landscape

  but the moon set an hour ago
i murmured in bewilderment

  then i stared with gaping mouth
and bulging eyes the arch of
constantine was growing hazy and
transparent while i gazed i turned
to the colosseum and saw that the
familiar sloping sides where time
had put its stamp of demolition were
fast fading away and in their stead
the outline of the vast arena became
more distinct in its pristine splen-
dor

  merciful heaven-am i going
mad i exclaimed passing a hand
across my eyes in perplexity

  when i looked again for the arch
of constantine it was pone some-
thing seemed to snap in my brain
and then-



rn the gods pliny you are miss-
ing the fun our new emperor
titus is marching with the legions
through the triumphal arch which
is just completed his route is
through the forum as it was nine
years ago upon his return from
jerusalem while his father vespa-
sian yet wore the purple


weird tales

  i looked up from the rock upon
which i was seated to see a familial
face regarding me affectionately

  i shouldnt want to miss that
quintilian i replied in the fluent
latin in which he had addressed me

  i cast a hurried glance at my at-
tire thinking how incongruous a
figure i must appear in a suit of the
twentieth century but my alarm
was short-lived for i perceived that
a spotless toga draped my body in
graceful folds

  my companion plucked my sleeve
and i arose and turned toward the
porum

  see exclaimed quintilian the
soldiers are already passing the
temple of vesta hurry

  stretching before me beneath an
azure sky lay the busy roman mar-
ket-place of the first century its
pure marble fanes and statues re-
flecting the brilliance of a mid-
afternoon sun throngs of white-
robed people intermingled with
young men in military accouter-
ments who were scattered singly and
in groups about the great mart

  my sensation was a most pcmiar
one while i recognized my identity
as paul ebson of cleveland ohio
at the same time i was cognizant
that as i stood here with my good
friend quintilian the famous rheto-
rician i was pliny the elder noted
naturalist of rome

  we forced our way through the
crowd and stood before a statue of
two figures symbolic of the con-
quest of judea by rome as beauti-
ful a piece of statuary as i had ever
seen comparable to the works of the
most noted greek sculptors rather
than to this decadent period of
roman art alas that the twentieth
century had never seen even a
remnant of this masterpiece of
sculptural art

  i was about to comment upon this
creation when the cheers of the
populace directed my attention to

the approaching procession at the
head of which mounted upon a
richly caparisoned steed rode young
titus emperor of rome he was
followed by a body-guard of stal-
wart men following this came a
cohort of roman soldiers and imme-
diately behind long lines of captive
jews eight abreast their heads
bowed to the yokes of the conquer-
ors then followed the legions of
rome their spears and shields
clattering rhythmically as they
marched toward the great triumphal
arch of titus

  a youth of eighteen years came
up to my side and greeted me with
a friendly salutation he was my
nephew pliny the younger who
shared with me the joys of scientific
research

  uncle he cried his eyes spark-
ling with excitement i wish i had
been old enough to have gone with
the legions of titus to jerusalem like
flavius over there but see they
have passed through the arch and
some of the soldiers are rejoining
the rest of us look here comes
tacitus isnt he handsome

  i looked at the stalwart young
soldier who was nearing our group
yes it was tacitus who though
young was establishing for himself
quite a reputation as an historian

  tacitus-tacitus i repeated
under my breath but i knew that
the youthful historian and soldier
was lee clayton

  tacitus regarded me with an
enigmatical smile

  is your ire still aroused pliny
that the portrait of my fellow his-
torian appears upon the arch and
mine does not he asked then he
added you must remember that
his years number more than mine
and that his reputation in the chosen
profession of both of us is already
established

  i know that my dear tacitus
i replied but i am convinced that
a certain soldier



your narratives adhere more strict-
ly to historical facts than do those
of your jewish rival and what is
more i dont like a man who can
take part in the overthrow of his
own people

  tacitus smiled i dont believe
the possibility of my becoming his
professional rival is worrying jose-
phus so much as the fact that the
fair julia has consented to become
my wife you know he sought her
hand after the death of his jewish
wife vashti his failure in love has
embittered him we have been do-
ing a little work jointly in preparing
an accurate chronicle of the siege of
jerusalem i asked him if he knew
who threw the lighted torch into the
window of the sanctuary of the
temple as i thought the act of
sufficient importance to warrant
minute detail in narration but he
was evasive upon the subject finally
remarking that the expression a
certain soldier was sufficient in-
formation to hand down to poster-
ity  that the deed and not the doer
was in this case of paramount im-
portance 

  well tacitus i said i ad-
mire your love of truth and detail
and i will do what i can to assist in
procuring for you the identity of
this certain soldier



our little group of four moved
slowly toward the arch of
titus while around us surged the
roman populace as we walked we
were greeted by friends on this side
and that at length we stood facing
the great arch through which the
legions of titus had but recently
filed how familiar it looked and
there in the foreground sculptured
among surrounding notables of pure
roman blood was the face of jose-
phus with the same expression of
mockery

  i tore my attention from the arch
to the scene in the forum the
crowds were thinning as the shadows
lengthened i became aware of an-
other piesence and turning i en-
countered the ironic gaze of the his-
torian josephus i recognized him
to be a man of extraordinary intel-
lect his lofty brow and thoughtful
eyes indicated that still there was
something about the man i did not
like and i was forced to confess to
myself that the feeling was in-
explicable

  well met pliny josephus said
in salutation i hear you leave on
the morrow for pompeii give my
regards to lucius sulla and tell him
that i will myself be in pompeii by
the ides of next month and here
is my fellow historian tacitus he
continued smiling upon the younger
man with a patronizing air how
goes the account of the siege

  i am still wanting to put a name
in the place of a certain soldier
tacitus replied future genera-
tions will not tolerate ambiguity
josephus shrugged his shoulders
and pointed with a smile toward the
portrait upon the arch quite an
honor for an insignificant soldier
dont you think my friends

  i am of the opinion that your
part in the siege may not have been
as insignificant as you would like to
have us believe i said

 what do you mean josephus
demanded his brow clouding

  i did not reply at once for quin-
tilian was excusing himself to go to
his home pliny the younger was
off for the new colosseum which had
been but recently completed

  when they were out of hearing
josephus repeated his question with
glowering mien then recalling sud-
denly the presence of tacitus con-
trolled his anger with effort i knew
that he would vouchsafe no informa-
tion in the presence of his rival his-
torian


weird tales

  i shot a significant glance into the
eyes of my dear friend tacitus and
remarked casually by the way
tacitus is it not the fair julias
daily custom to ride in the vicinity
of the colosseum toward sundown in
the chariot of her father agricola
you have spoken truly pliny i
am to meet her at the hour of sun-
down by the golden house of
nero the young man replied

  i will say farewell tacitus i
ealled after him for i may not
see you again until my return from
pompeii  

  the latters reference to julia did
not improve the temper of the jew-
ish historian who turned to me with
a third repetition of his question

  i will ask you josephus i re-
plied quietly why the portrait of
a certain soldier who ignites the
sanctuary of his own besieged peo-
ple is not important enough to ap-
pear on a triumphal arch but there
ie one objection his name should ap-
pear in the written chronicle 

  the historian trembled with
mingled fear and rage and his voice
was thick as he answered do you
dare to identify me with that ac-
cursed  certain soldier   

  i looked sternly at the wretched
man through narrowed eyes and
said josephus if you will write a
confession of your deed you will
find favor with the gods and pos-
terity will hold your records in good
repute

  and what if i have already re-
vealed in writing the name of the
soldier who was moved by a divine
impulse to throw a lighted torch
into the window of the sanctuary
he asked mockingly 

  divine impulse i exclaimed
would you consider it a divine im-
pulse were i suddenly to seize a bar
and demolish the sculptural figure
of yonder smirking jew who aids in
the overthrow of his people

  his apparent terror wrung my
heart

  but your confession i urged in
gentler tones where is the writ-
ten chronicle you mentioned in
which a certain soldier is named

  in my bosom the secret lies
pliny and there it shall stay-yes
it shall be unrevealed till twenty
centuries have rolled by historians
are sometimes permitted glimpses of
the future as well as of the past

  i lunged toward mm but he fled
his prophetie words ringing in my
ears i stood alone in the roman
forum before the arch of titus
gazing at the smug countenance of
the sculptured josephus that seemed
gloating over the secret within its
breast

  within its breast

  by all the immortal gods i
cried i understand the words of
josephus in my bosom the secret
lies

  impetuously i picked up a blunt
bar that lay on the ground a few
feet away and cast a hurried glance
around me from behind the tem-
ple of jupiter stator a figure was
approaching i recognized it as that
of taeitus returning from his ride
with julia i lifted the bar for a
shattering stroke that did not fall

  the beautiful arch was aging be-
fore my eyes corners were becom-
ing worn away inscriptions grew
faint and in some instances were
completely obliterated weeds and
the creepers of vines clambered over
the surface and many of the chiseled
features were chipped or worn
smooth by the fingers of time the
face of josephus was gone complete-
ly for all posterity might know a
typically roman visage could have
topped those shoulders

i stood aghast but with undi-
minished ardor commenced to knock
away the marble folds that covered
the breast of josephus then i felt

ear pater-

           its tremendously
decent of you to offer to go
up to cumberland and see coral
yourself this cellist torkel yarl
who drifted into the hydro after i
left sounds a dangerous sort of
bounder and im not only jealous
but really afraid for coral

  its so foreign to her nature to
make sudden friendships with any-
one-shes as shy as a blue-jay-and
thats why this violent intimacy
alarms me

  she is wrought up to a fever-pitch

of excitement over yarl and his
  w t-

music and seems to spend the whole
day working with him our orches-
tra broke up when the summer
season was over at brackenfells
hydro but both coral and myself
are booked for the xmas season there
i took a temporary job of playing
first violin at this cinema because the
pay was so tempting and means
marrying coral six months earlier

  she stayed on at brackenfells at a
nominal salary to entertain any stray
visitors that might drift in and to
rest before the xmas rush begins 
theyre tuning up and the big drum

i	am using as a table is wanted so
am i

  do go as soon as possible

ear miles-

           what soul-searching
questions you ask i cant answer
them now because i have so much to
tell you about the music i have been
doing

  torkel yarl is marvelous even
the great casals seems to fade into a
mere amateur beside him its not
only his playing-he improvises
superbly too it quite frightens me
sometimes for i cant understand
how any man can do what he does

  he plays from memory everything
you and i have ever done not only
cello solos but arrangements of big
orchestral things as well the lalo
concerto boellmanns variations
saint-saens allegro and chopins
polonaise in c are a few examples of
his repertory

  do you remember the mendelssohn
fugue in e flat for strings  he pro-
duced a piano part for me in script
and he does the rest dont ask me
how-it is quite beyond me his
genius is so great that it is almost
terrible particularly in his own
compositions they are more like the
wildest sort of slav music than any-
thing else i have heard but far more
barbaric i always dread playing
his own works though i dont know
why i do

 torkel says i have a certain
amount of genius but am too senti-
mental to use it properly i was
furious when he said this but he only
laughed and then took up his bow
and played so divinely that i forgot
to be angry any more

of course i love you and miss you
miles why do you ask me so often

 i went up to the red tarn on
monks rock last week-that place
has an extraordinary attraction for
me now i got a nasty deep scratch-
on my arm when i was by the tarn

which wont heal up i cant remem-
ber how i did it though

                 with love

                       yours

v	dear boy-

           as i have often told
you it gives me the greatest happi-
ness whenever you turn to me for
help your pride and independence
make it difficult for me now that
you are no longer a schoolboy

  you have been quite frank with
me about coral and i will be equally
frank with you-chiefly because you
must be prepared to play the hardest
part in the awful little drama which
torkel yarl has staged your part is
to wait and do nothing  no matter
how desperate the crisis you can not
help-only hinder

  torkel yarl is not a man as you
and i understand the word he is
not a human being-but superhuman
literally sttperhuman

  physically he has all the character-
istics of his danish forefathers his
name-yarl or eorl-gives you the
clue to his ancestry of course he
is powerfully built and tall in pro-
portion and moves with the ease and
grace of a panther his eyes add to
this illusion they are unnaturally
bright and gleam under drooped eye-
lids in a horribly compelling fashion

  as to his music-it is a weapon of
such supreme power that it would
rouse the dead to follow him over the
edge of the world

  why am i not under his spell you
ask ah because years ago i learnt
what power inspires such as torkel
yarl-and behind those gleaming
the lord of the tarn



eyes of his i see his devil seated lust-
ful and mocking

  the missing finger on his hand is a
distinguishing mark which may help
when it comes to the final proving of
my theories

  dont forget to be cautious in your
references to me when you write to
coral she has no idea who i am

           oct 

earest miles-

           you always warned
me not to let my dreams blot out
reality too far and i seem to have
done it i have wandered out into
space and when i want to return i
find there is no room

  you bring me back always-but i
know that soon even the memory of
your love will not draw me i shall
just go on and on-and never re-
turn will that be death miles
but thats absurd of course-i am
perfectly well

 i have changed my mind again
about our wedding if you still want
me i will marry you when you come
back at xmas i hope coral warri-
ner will be better worth your loving
than coral deane-but i am afraid
you are taking a risk dear

  dont you think it is curious that
i have grown to love the red tarn
so much do you remember the first
time we saw it together one late
autumn day last year  what a deso-
late wind-swept place it seemed
then-the water of the tarn cold and
gleaming under the gray sky-the
tall yellow reeds rustling and shiver-
ing on its banks i was never so
afraid of any place out in the open
before do you remember what a
coward i was and how i thought i
saw figures crouching and stealing
about among the stunted trees and
patches of gorse

  and yet i love the tarn now more
than any other spot in teordale
torkel has written music about it for
me called the voice of the tarn it
is the wildest music in the world and
the sweetest-in b flat minor my
favorite key

  the theme steals in like a ghost
wandering lost and lonely by the
tarn the four winds carry its
lament until it swells to longing and
despair in great crashing chords
that make me tremble the modula-
tions arc very abrupt-breathless
swoops from one height to another-
and it finishes with a wild burst of
gayety in a major key like mocking
laughter high above the tarn

  the curious thing is that i can
never recall a single phrase of the
music unless i am on the monks
rock the instant i set foot on the
ascent from the valley i hear vague
murmurs which get clearer as i climb
up sometimes i am dizzy and be-
wildered by the rushing harmonies
that greet me as the deep waters of
the tarn come into sight it is almost
more than i can bear to hear once
i must have fainted-for i discov-
ered later the deep scratch on my
arm of which i told you and i cant
remember doing it it still wont
heal up

  one of the guests at the hydro is
a mr donald he has traveled all
over the world and we have long talks
together i was telling him about
you just before i began this letter
he seemed to bring you much nearer
to me

  thats why i can write and tell
you how much i love you miles in
spite of my queerness-never believe
that you are not the only one that
really counts in the whole world to
me

  good-bye miles darling the
tarn would be mysteriously beautiful
by moonlight-i must see it

im living in a perfect hell of doubt
and fear pater coral has just
sent me a letter which brings her
back to me as she used to be before
this infernal yarl started in but
two things in it worry me horribly

  first-what is the matter with her
arm-why wont the scratch heal
up is it blood-poisoning on top of
all the rest

  and has she told you about want-
ing to see the red tarn at night
for heavens sake dont let her do
that at night the shadows would
make the path impossible-its more
or less dangerous even in the day-
light i am appalled at the idea

  its slow torture-this waiting
business why cant i come and do
the devil out once and for all id
rather be hanged for it than let
coral go on like this from day to
day	miles

  p s dont curse me for worrying
you i know you cant do more
but this is plain unadulterated hell

y	dear boy -

             you can not real-
ize at a distance in spite of my daily
letters how things are going and i
am afraid you find my methods slow
and dangerous when yarl is using
every hour so am i however   
but yarl must be allowed to show
himself in his true colors before i
can act

  the scratch on corals arm might
be described in a rather dramatic
way as a devil mark yarl has
evidently made an attempt to get her
when she went to the red tam on
one of her solitary walks he failed
because his hour is not yet come it
will heal when yarl ceases to exist
and not until then it is not dan-
gerous in itself-simply a brand

  if it were of any use to kill this
man outright i should not hesitate
to do so but if he were sent out of
life now he would return in another
human form-and with added power
and malevolence

  for your comfort i can tell you
plainly that there is an hour and a
place where i can come to grips with
the devil that dwells in him and for
that hour i am waiting

  now read the enclosed account of
the early history of cumberland and
you will understand whence torkel
yarl derives his power

  i must go back to the year 
a d when hywel dda a prince of
south wales made a law for the pro-
tection of cats with the result that
the chazza the old high german
name for cat was brought over in
increasing quantities from the baltic
shores and became domesticated in
our island new and terrible super-
stitions sprang up-the old egyptian
worship of cats was revived in crude
revolting forms by our barbaric an-
cestors  and the chazza was the
center and excuse for a thousand
nameless obscenities

  this cat worship lingered in re-
mote parts of the country-and as
late as the twelfth century there
are traces of it in a few of the so-
called religious houses of those days

  one such abbey given over to
satanism and every evil practise
was built here in teordale by the red
tarn which served as a fish-pond for
the monks-and was known as the
tam of chazz or chazza

  this abbey was built by a danish
the lord of the tarn

earl of cumberland the lord of
chazz who was immensely wealthy
and powerful and dominated the
place to such an extent that its real
spiritual head father david was
sacrificed at one of the abominable
orgies for which the abbey was re-
nowned

  this roused the countryside and
an organized attack was made under
father ambrosius the chronicler of
the event which surprized the
monks in the very act of their
demon worship

  father ambrosius leaves much un-
said and refers briefly and with
pious horror to monstrous cats speak-
ing with  the voices of men and
women blasphemous prayers to luci-
fer wild hell-games played round
the stately cloisters shameful litanies
recited in the abbey chapel and the
celebration of the black mass at the
high altar-once dedicated to the
glory of god

  father ambrosius and his devoted
band of followers burnt the abbey to
the ground and the smoke and flame
of it lit the whole of cumberland ac-
cording to the chronicler the cats
or monks or both they slew by the
sword-for against their blades
dipped in holy water the power of
satan was useless they flung the
bodies into the tarn of chazz until
the black pond was red with blood
and it has been known as the red
tam ever since

  but the fiercest and most devilish
of all that monstrous crew escaped
he fled spitting and snarling before
the good fathers sword-and leap-
ing off the face of monks rock van-
ished into the darkness of the night

  my belief is that this was the ruler
of that infamous abbey-the lord of
chazz-and that he lives still-in the
person of torhel yarl he is sus-
tained by the power of those he
serves and in return for their protec-
tion he sacrifices a victim at certain
intervals

  the last friday of this month is
the night of sacrifice-and i need
hardly add that coral is the destined
victim

 do not be led by blind love-or
fear-into coming to interfere with
my plans it would be entirely fatal
to coral

ear miles-

           your last letter
was a rather queer one i thought
and you hardly mentioned all the
new music i am studying-arent you
interested 

  torkel has promised to give me the
ms of the voice of the tarn on con-
dition that i take him up to see the
red tam itself we are going on
friday and i can think of nothing
else tqrkel wants to see it by
moonlight-and as the moon is full
tomorrow night it ought to be a mar-
velous sight

 think of it miles    that
strange shadowy tarn with its fringe
of reeds all silvered in the moonlight
and the water gleaming white and
silent i can hardly breathe as the
thought of it burns in my mind

 what did you mean about my
promise to marry you at xmas i
have never mentioned it to you that

weird tales

  however youll have to use your
imagination to fill up the blanks and
remember that im working hard in
a cold uninteresting dirty city and
missing you every hour of the day
the heat of the theater makes me
more dull-witted than usual too
but dont think that i am ever in-
different to anything that interests
you

  im glad youve made friends with
mr donald-your walks and talks
with him ought to be a soothing con-
trast with the excitement of all your
musical studies

  the theater music here is deadly
stuff jazz punctuated by rach-
maninoffs c sharp minor prelude
when the hero fights a duel or
crosses the rapids or crawls from a
blazing house with the heroine in his
arms

  my violin sings very low now you
spoilt me entirely for an ordinary
pianist my bad little coral  was
down for a solo last night-and upon
my word that accompanist was as
near sudden death as she will ever
be

  think of me sometimes my little
girl its pretty lonely here good-
night my elfin queen dont go off
with the moon fairies if you meet
them on the crags i want you when-
ever you are ready to come to me i
hope that will be soon

flicker to and fro across it

of carlisle extract

                   the vicarage
                   nov 

     sir donald fremling and i
reached the summit of monks rock
early in the evening as the moon
rose and the shadows deepened the
wide moorland grew more and more
sinister

  it was a terrible vigil i saw the
reeds bend under the foot of some
half-visible passer-by and heard the
whispering voice of evil at my elbow
and echoes of high squealing laugh-
ter and from the ghyll close by
the biting wind shrieked and tore
its way-adding its fury to the ter-
ror of the night

 the hour and the power
the lord of the tarn



quoted fremling in my ears as he
pointed across the waving grasses
i gasped as the fresh horror dawned
slowly before us

  there only a few hundred yards
or so away a huge bulk began to
blot out the sky and stars walls
rose and were roofed over court-
yards and cobbled garths covered
the windy heath gable and turret
tower and cloister all built them-
selves before our very eyes-until at
last a stately abbey stood complete
in every detail-its weather-vane
gleaming in the moonlight and
every window brilliant with the
lights within

  the stage is set replied sir
donald in answer to the clutch of
my fingers on his arm it remains
now for the lord of chazz to arrive
and summon his guests to the rev-
elries  

  i must confess my lord that my
faith burnt very dim in that hour of
waiting had it not been for the un-
shaken courage of my companion i
should have fled from the unhal-
lowed place and left my small part
in the drama unplayed

 suddenly i heard a laugh-a
happy little sound which made the
obscene mirth echoing about me on
the wind more terrible by its con-
trast i knew it was the girl coral
deane and torkel yarl approaching
the tarn at last

  in a few minutes they neared the
tarn and stood in the strong moon-
light not far from the hollow
where we lay hidden

  the girl stood silent and en-
chanted-her delicate lovely face lit
with a white fire of ecstasy-her
hair streamed back in the wind like
a halo of light-and her clear eyes
were those of one who watches the
gates of heaven opening to let her
in

  i was ashamed of my own fears as
i saw her there so unaware and in-
nocent and on the brink of such

nameless horror and i longed to
dash that grinning devil by her side
into the dark bubbling water of the
tarn

  suddenly yarl stepped forward
and gave a great ringing cry which
echoed and re-echoed until i
thought every hill in cumberland
had caught and thrown back that in-
fernal summons

  as it died the tarn rose in leap-
ing waves flecking the reeds which
fringed it with blood-red foam

  the girls face lost its rapt dream-
ing look and she stared in horror at
the tarn-for from its depths
emerged an evil face and head fol-
lowed by the body of a man in a
brown habit girdled with rope he
scrambled out of the water and up
the bank-and at his heels followed
a long procession every one of
which was more brutish and ugly
than his fellow

  they were the monks of monks
rock come to make merry in their
old haunt once more

  yarl waved them on toward the
abbey-and at his gesture the girl
turned her stricken face and ap-
peared to see for the first time the
great illuminated building towering
against the sky she gave a long
incredulous look and turned to yarl
with a little cry then as she saw
him truly at last  a devil-mock-
ing lustful and triumphant she
covered her face and sank to the
ground

  he laughed loudly at her terror
and picking her up in his great arms
strode on toward the abbey-the
mad shouting crew of monks at his
heels

  when the last capering figure had
disappeared under the arch of the
central door fremling and i fol-
lowed and gained the abbey by a
small door at the east end we
crept into the chapel and stood be-
hind the high altar hidden by a
massive screen


weird tales

  the reek of incense filled the
place and the flare of torches lit
monstrous presentments of heathen
gods and devils on walls and
pillars

  abruptly the main door was flung
open-and to a burst of wild music
the monks came trooping in be-
hind them followed yarl-leading
the girl with mock courtesy by the
hand she looked like a white
flower in this fiends abode and
swayed half blind with terror

  yarl led her to a great throne at
the foot of the altar steps the poor
child sat her hands clutching the
skulls which formed the arms of her
black throne and her wide blank
gaze followed each monk in turn as
he knelt at her feet and with horrid
jest and leer made homage to her

  then they filled priceless jeweled
goblets with foaming liquor and
crowded about yarl and coral as
she shrank back in her place lift-
ing their goblets high they shouted
-hail hail chazza eorl of
cumberland lord of life and
death we drink to your queen
and our feast tonight  hail lord
of chazz hail

  they drank deep-and as that
magic draft worked in his veins
eveiy monk changed his human
form until at last no trace of man
or monk was left-and only mon-
strous snarling cats leapt and cir-
cled about  yarl and the girl

  then i heard yarl laugh and saw
him touch the girl on the arm-and
a long scratch on it began to bleed

  yarl laughed again and all the
beasts with him

  instantly fremling withdrew by
the door we had entered-and i
came out of my hiding-place and
stood at the high altar and lifted
the sacred host above my head a
great silence fell-the squalling
brutes were dumb-and i called
loudly to coral to come to me   

i called her in the name of god and
that holy thing i held

  she stood up swaying and looked
from yarl to me--and back again
yarl tried to hold her but his power
failed and his arm dropped to his
side

  again i called-and then with a
childs cry of terror and appeal she
stumbled down the steps of that
hateful throne and fell at my feet
i stooped and held her while yarl
stood speechless glaring at me and
his devils crouched as if turned to
stone

  then warned by some sound yarl
turned to see sir donald fremling
standing behind him-a short dag-
ger in his hand

  in a flash yarl stooped and lifted
a flagon to his lips and in a moment
crouched transformed and beastlike
before his enemy

  then the lights of the abbey
chapel faded-the walls melted into
thin air-and i found myself stand-
ing with coral on the bleak moor-
land by the tarn whose deep waters
foamed blood-red over the bodies of
monks as they sank beneath its
waves

  i caught a glimpse again of frem-
ling struggling on the ground with
his loathsome antagonist-and the
spitting hissing sound of the fight
rose above the winds shrill cry
then i saw man and beast roll off
the edge of the ridge of monks
rock and disappear into the depths
below   

extract from the cumberland
comet newspaper

monks rock in teordale cum-
berland has been the stage
for as strange an incident as has oc-
curred in recent times the vicar of
teordale made the ascent to the red
tarn last friday evening together
with two members of the brackenfells
the lord of the tarn



hydro orchestra-miss coral deane
and mr torkel yarl and lastly sir
donald fremling the -world-renowed
mystic and savant

  the latter appears to have had a
fight of unprecedented horror with a
wild cat which met the party on the
summit of the rock

  sir donald fremling was carry-
ing a dagger a remarkable occur-
rence in itself he killed the beast
but in the death struggle they both
rolled off the fell-side and were dis-
covered next morning by search-
parties far down the screes in a
tangle of bushes the monster cat
was cold and stiff but horribly men-
acing even in death the handle of
the dagger protruded from its body
and has been left there at sir don-
alds express wish the latter seemed

peculiarly interested in the fact that
a joint and claw of the creatures
left foreleg were missing

  sir donald fremlings leg was
broken and he was badly mauled but
is recovering rapidly

  the vicar hailed the search party
from the summit of the monks eoek
where he had for hours vainly tried
to restore miss deane to conscious-
ness she was carried home and ap-
pears to be making some progress
toward recovery

  no trace has been discovered of the
fourth member of the party-torkel
yarl the cellist it is feared that in
searching for sir donald fremling
after his fall from the rock yarl

     out of the grass when the dew is wet
     their houses lean and their hoards are set
     deep in the woods that are not yet

      out of the earth when the night is cold
      their worm-dogs lean and over the wold
      they fly with tales that are not told

     out of the wold when the moon rides low
     their witch-fires flicker and tapers glow
     to guide the goblins to and fro

     out of the lake when the comets pass
     their maidens rise and over the grass
     they crawl like shadows on a glass

     out of the east when the stars spin high
     they dance and dance and the years go by
     and the sun and moon fade out of the sky

      and still they dance

police are searching today for
dr j e lawlor well-known
physician and scientist follow-
ing a report from his secretary
james brock that he had disap-
peared from his home at  van
ness avenue

  according to brock dr lawlor
locked himself into his private lab-
oratory twelve days ago ordering his
servants not to disturb him and to
send food down by means of a dumb-
waiter as he had followed this plan
several times before while working on
experiments brock complied with his
request the time set was ten days
and when there had been no response
from the laboratory durin the two


days following the elapse of this
period brock feared some accident
and with the help of georges dmitri
dr lawlors cook and emil bonner
his chauffeur he forced the door this
morning and found that the doctor
was gone

  a weird angle is added to the in-
cident by the dead body of a large
ape which brock found in a corner
of the disordered laboratory al-
though dr lawlor was known to be
interested in natural history and to
have conducted several experiments
with animals recently brock stated
that he was sure the ape was not in
the laboratory when it was closed
twelve days ago the table was cov-
ered with papers which have been
turned over to the police
back to the beast



  brock dmitri and bonner are held
for questioning by chief of police
john walton

  dr lawlor has no immediate fam-
ily a brother stanley lawlor of
topeka kansas has been notified

attempts to determine the species
of the ape found dead in the
laboratory of dr j e lawlor who
disappeared last saturday were un-
successful when professor f w
baylor head of the natural science
department of the state university
said today that he had never seen
such a creature before

  there are eight kinds of anthro-
poid apes known to science said
professor baylor but this ape be-
longs to none of them it has some of
the characteristics of several but re-
sembles no single kind greatly it is
either a freak or of a species un-
known until now

  professor baylor has ordered the
animal embalmed and intends to send
it to fellow-students of natural his-
tory in chicago

jambs brock private secretary of
dr j e lawlor  van ness
avenue was placed under arrest to-
day to face charges of kidnaping and
possibly murder of his employer last
saturday

  the arrest took place following the
reading of papers purporting to be
a journal of an experiment per-
formed by the doctor which brock
turned over to the police upon his
employers disappearance brock
had been held for questioning but
was given his liberty saturday

  the contents of the journal were
not made public but chief john
walton described them as prepos-
terous and unbelievable a forgery by

brock to cover a very evident

crime

   extracts from the papers given to
police by james brock as the journal

june -all is in readiness for
my experiment-the final step in
my great work that will afford scien-
tists a true glimpse of how man ap-
peared in the dim past the narrow
persons who refuse to believe in evo-
lution will be forced to see the truth
for we will confront them not with
theories but with proofs

  i have material now that would
fill a great book-notes telling how i
first discovered the combination of
elements that induces deterioration
and of my experiments with it first
on the lowest forms of life then on
more complex animals with surpriz-
ing and enlightening results years
have been consumed in this study but
soon they will be paid for when i re-
veal what i have learned

  the elements for the two serums
products of nearly a lifetime of labor
and observation are at hand one
serum is the deteriorator which when
properly mingled and administered
will make vital changes in the organs
and tissues of an animal changes
which finally result in giving it the
appearance of its ancestors untold
ages ago this change can be ar-
rested by the administration of the
counter-agent which will restore the
transformed creature to its former
condition

  i do not suppose that any person
less determined or less scientific in
mind than i would dare perform this
experiment upon himself but after
all it is as safe as such a thing can
be i have studied its effects and
powers too much and too long to go
wrong now and i know that i shah
not be mentally incapable of hand-
ling it the change is physiological
not psychological foretelling the


weird tales

course of the whole process is a mere
matter of rationalization

  as i plan it i will let the deterio-
rator work in my blood for five days
then the counter-agent for five days
to make sure that the effects of the
experiment are completely dissi-
pated thus i expect to see in my
mirror what my ancestors were like
five thousand centuries ago and then
return to the body and semblance of
dr lawlor all within two weeks at
the least

  i have locked my door for ten
days brock a sound sensible fellow
who obeys my orders without ques-
tioning will see to it that i am undis-
turbed and after this private ex-
periment i shall present my findings
to my fellow-scientists as the proof
of their theories who can say that
my name shall not be numbered with
those of the great evolutionists

  june -for twenty-four hours i
have had the serum in my blood
with what care i compounded it and
injected it into the vein of my arm
you may well imagine the effects
were noticeable at once my blood
llowed faster and for a few moments
i felt strangely light-headed as if i
had been drinking this latter feel-
ing passed away and i perspired
freely but felt no unpleasant sensa-
tions throughout the day i have
taken notes on the progress of the ex-
periment and tonight my mirror
shows me that it is a success

  the change in my appearance has
not been so great as i expected but it
is very evident i am florid and
ruddy where i have generally been
pale i am far more robust and all
over my body my hair has grown out
especially on the breast and shoulders
and outsides of the arms-a strange
condition for me always smooth-
skinned and of late years partly bald
i never felt better physically in my
life and i look not the fine-drawn
and slender scientist but a full-
bodied really splendid savage

  in excess of well-being and in joy
at the certain fulfilment of my ex-
pectations i danced and leaped up
and down this evening then a little
ashamed of myself i sat down to
write

  june -the effects of the serum
are more pronounced today where
yesterday i was but a primitive man
still decidedly human i am today a
man with a pronounced bestial look
my forehead has receded my jaw is
heavy with sharp-pointed teeth the
change works in me every moment
i can feel it in my flesh and bones
among other things i am positively
shaggy the hair makes my clothes
a discomfort and i have left them
completely off

  i am never weary of watching my
body as it changes almost before my
very eyes it is especially interest-
ing to see how springy and flexible
my joints have become and how my
feet have a tendency to turn their
palms inward this is because of the
great toe which is beginning to
stand out from the others like a
thumb excellent proof that our an-
cestors were tree-dwellers and could
get a grip with their feet

  june -when i awoke on my cot
this morning my first glance was to-
ward the mirror it was unable to
recognize myself unable to recognize
even the thing i had been last night
in the -broad coarse face with flat
nose splay nostrils little beady eyes
under beetling brows wide mouth
and brutal jaws in the hairy hulk-
ing body there was no reminder of
what had once been dr lawlor
some scholars would be frightened at
the speed and effectiveness with
which the serum has worked but i
can think of nothing save the
triumph to science

  i am stooped considerably and
stand unsteadily on my legs not that
they are not strong but the tendency
of my feet to turn inward has in-
creased so that i walk for the most
back to the beast



part on the outer edges their pre-
hensile powers are developed too
and they can pick up objects quite
easily

  it is also interesting to note that
my mental processes have not
changed one whit-i can think as
clearly and as deeply as ever as i
predicted the serum does not effect
the brain tissues or if it does it
does not keep them from functioning
properly

  i have been hungry all day the
food brock sent to me was not suffi-
cient especially as regards meat
and i must send up a note with the
empty dishes for him to increase the
amount

  june -this part of the experi-
ment will stop tomorrow for i shall
then mix and administer the counter-
agent

  tonight i see myself to be an eery
creatuie half beast half man i am
hard put to it to walk without sup-
porting myself on the table and the
backs of the chairs so must our an-
cestors have looked when they swung
down from the trees to achieve their
first adventures on the ground and
to conquer the world

  these five days what with the
many notes i have taken will provide
a fitting climax for the scientific book
that i contemplate how it will as-
tound the world what honors and
distinctions may descend upon me
fame is mine certainly fortune if
i wish it may follow

  so good-night and good-bye my
primitive self yonder in the mirror
tomorrow i shall commence the jour-
ney back to the appearance of dr
lawlor that i may immortalize you
in all your fascinating grotesqueness

 tune -how could i-oh how
 could i not provide against this
with all the machinery of my experi-
mentation evidently flawless i must
forget a single item-an item mad-
deningly simple maddeningly ob-

vious and yet a thing that has
proved my undoing

  let me remain sane for a moment
and marshal the incidents as they oc-
curred there is not much to tell
this morning i went to my shelf of
chemicals for the ingredients to com-
pound into the counteracting serum
my hands which of course had be-
come clumsy and primitive seemed
to have trouble in picking up the lit-
tle vials but this did not worry me
as i began the combining of my ma-
terials two of them i mixed in a
graduated glass and then reached for
a pipette to administer the third

  but my unsteady manipulation did
not allow the proper proportion to
flow in i released a drop too much
and though there was a correspond-
ing effervescence i could see that the
mixture was a failure i poured it
out and tried again with the same
result with growing uneasiness i
made a third attempt and again my
clumsy hands failed me

  too late i realized that the ming-
ling of the elements in the proper
proportions and manner had been a
task that required all the delicacy of
a skilled chemist my hands no
longer the deft steady hands of dr
lawlor were those of a sub-human
creature and as such not equal to the
feat

 horrible horrible i moaned
aloud when i realized what had hap-
pened and what would follow with-
out the counter-agent i could not
neutralize or even halt the progress
of the deteriorator down i must go
back along the road up which the
human race has struggled for untold
centuries

  again and again i desperately
tried to mix the dose until i had
used up all my materials once or
twice i thought that i had approxi-
mated the proper mingling but when
i injected it there was no effect

  i sit here tonight a rung farther
toward the beast from whence we


weird tales

sprang instead of on the road back
toward man like one lowered into
a well i see above me a circle of light
growing smaller and dimmer as i
descend into darkness and horror
what shall i do

  from this point forward the
journal is written in an almost unin-
telligible scrawl

  june -for three days i have
not written i have not slept and
have eaten only when the pangs of
hunger roused me from my half-
trance of misery horror has closed
over my head like water

  at first i searched frantically for
more materials for the counter-agent
literally wrecking my laboratory but
to no avail i had used it all in try-
ing to mix the saving dose three days
ago

  today was to have been the last
day of my experiment perhaps the
servants will force the lock if i do not
come out and then

  i could never make them under-
stand i have no more power of
speech than any other beast for a
beast i have surely become i can
not bear to look in the mirror for i
see only a dark hairy form hunched
over the table a pencil clutched in
its paw and that is i james
lawlor what wonder that i border
on the edge of insanity

  let whoever reads these words take
warning from my plight do not
meddle with the scheme of things as

nature has planned-delve not into
her mysterious past i have done
that and it was my complete and
dreadful undoing if it had not come
in this way it would have come in an-
other i do not doubt for a moment

  june -morning i have not
budged from the chair where i sat to
write last evening i heard brocks
voice outside the door asking me if
i was coming out i dared not make
a sound in reply and he went away

  is existence bearable in such a
condition even now the sliding
back into lower and lower form con-
tinues it will not be long before i
am no longer even the ape-thing i
appear perhaps the serum will
carry me back through the ages until
i am the slimy sea-crawler from
which all life had its beginning oh
god  

  and as if in answer to that name
comes the memory of what still re-
mains in a drawer of my table ar-
senic-not an easy death but a quick
one so shall i die for if ever a
creature was justified in taking its
own life that creature is myself

  i will leave this journal as an ac-
count of what has happened and as
a warning to others the formulas
for my serums and all that pertains
to them i will destroy never shall
another scientist meet with my fate
if i can order it otherwise there
the papers are flaming in the grate
now for the arsenic-so much in a
glass of water-farewell

  here the journal eis
held in its shapeless form were men who hung
helpless in its grasp

chapter 
the people op the city

a harsh order from the
guards ahead halted us and
i had time to survey the room
in which we stood it was a circular
room at the edge of which we were
grouped from where we stood the
walls swept away in a great curve on
either side meeting directly opposite
us as it seemed some ninety feet
away the floor of the room was of
smooth black stone resembling
marble while the curving walls were
of the same white material as the
buildings exterior a hundred feet
above the floor was a ceiling of white
and i saw at a glance that this one

                 

there to fight-as a gladiator

this story began in weird talks for october
c

weird tales

great liall occupied the whole lower
half of the cylindrical buildings in-
terior the upper half no doubt being
divided into smaller apartments set
in walls and ceiling were many of the
glowing bulbs and from these a cas-
cade of ruddy light poured down on
the people in the room

  there must have been nearly a
hundred of these people men and
women they lay on couches along
the rooms edge with long curving
tables of green metal before them
like the banquet halls of the ancient
romans a shock went through me
as i looked at the feasters for they
were unlike any of the people i had
seen as i entered the city these
people were all tall and perfectly pro-
portioned and all were golden-
liaircd men and women alike they
were attired in short robes or tunics
of brilliantly colored silks and some
wore circlets of flashing gems

  with a sudden shock it came to me
that these were the first women i had
seen in all this city for there had
been none among the guards and
slaves outside but before i could
ponder this fact it was swept from
my mind by my wonder at the other
things in the room

  the feasters i saw were engaged
in drinking from transparent goblets
which held brightly colored liquids
i could see no solid food of any kind
on the tables but there were many
urns and flagons and amphorae filled
with the bright fluids long lines
of the white-robed stiffly marching
slaves passed and repassed behind the
couches of the feasters with metal
trays holding other glass and metal
vessels which they placed on the
tables

  two other things i noted before
my brief survey of the place was in-
terrupted one was that among the
laughing shouting people at the ta-
bles there was not one face that
would not be called beautiful al
seemed youthful with the beauty of

youth and its high spirits yet an
impression of evil came to me as i
watched them i sensed beneath
their jesting and laughing a cold
indolent heartlessness

  the other thing i noted was the
source of the crystalline music across
the room from me in an alcove were
the musicians slaves who operated an
intricate instrument which allowed
water to fall on thin plates of metal
in single drops or streamlets produc-
ing a tumultuous chiming like a
storm of silver bells wild and clear
and sweet and for all its tempestu-
ousness oddly harmonious

  my companions had been survey-
ing the scene like myself but it was
evident from the expressions on their
faces that it was not new to them i
wondered for what purpose we had
been brought there and remembering
the englishmans interrupted ex-
planation turned to speak to him
but as i did so came another inter-
ruption and with it my answer

  one of the men at the tables rose
and uttered a brief order and at once
a great black slave strode across the
room seized a mace of metal and
with it struck a tremendous blow on
a hanging brazen gong at once the
chatter and song at the tables stopped
and all eyes were turned toward our-
selves i felt their gaze sweeping
over us and involuntarily shuddered
then beside us the captain of the
guards barked out an order that
sounded across the silence like a
whiplash and at once two of the
men who stood beside me strode out
to the center of the room to the wide
clear floor there and stood facing
each other

 there was a rippling whisper
through the spectators at the tables
a murmur of pleasurable excitement
without heeding it the two men at
the rooms ccnter inspected each
other with fierce eyes

  one of the two was a proud dark-
faced figure high-nosed and gleam-
the time-raider



ing-eyed dressed in torn flowing
robe and with a tightly twisted tur-
ban on his head he jerked from his
belt a long curved simitar and
whirled it above his head giving vent
to a ragged high-pitched yell of de-
fiance an arab i thought maybe
one of the very hordes that had car-
ried the green banner of the prophet
over three continents like a whirl-
wind he was a fierce enough spec-
tacle as he shook his gleaming blade
aloft but his opponent was a fit one
a gigantic northman in leathern
jerkin whose blue eyes gleamed as he
too sprang forward brandishing aloft
a great ax in one hand and carrying
a small circular shield in the other

  with weapons upraised the two
cautiously neared each other circling
like wary tigers searching for an
opening i turned away and saw
that the feasters were wholly intent
now on the two opponents and in
that moment i understood the mean-
ing of the englishman in saying that
we had been brought here to fight
for it was so and all in our ragged
fierce group would no doubt be forced
to fight and slay one another to amuse
the indolent spectators at the tables
as the gladiators of ancient rome
had struck each other down in the
great games and what of myself

  there was a sudden great shout
from the tables and i turned my at-
tention back to the struggle at the
center of the floor the arabs blade
had darted past his opponents shield
and had wounded the latter in the
shoulder with a flashing down-stroke
but the leather-clad giant was not
beaten though blood was streaming
down from his shoulder now he said
no word only lifted his shield higher
and circled around the other with ax
still poised ready to strike the tense
silence had been broken by that first
shout and now those at the tables
were calling out to the two fighters
warnings and advice i supposed and

were laying wagers on the result of
the fight

  suddenly the arab again darted
in and again his blade slashed the
others arm but as he stepped swift-
ly back his foot slipped on the blood
that smeared the smooth floor and he
staggered for a moment striving to
regain his balance in an instant the
uplifted ax crashed down through
his skull and he fell like a dropped
weight his own spouting arteries
adding to the red stains on the floor
the other stepped back panting and
a great shout of applause crashed out
from the spectators at the tables the
northman rejoined our group slaves
rushed out and cleared the floor and
at a command two more of our num-
ber rushed onto the floor and faced
each other with drawn swords

  the circling and darting of the
former duel was repeated and in a
few minutes one of the two lay dead
and the other was limping back to
us bleeding and another pair took
their place

  for the fifth combat the young
englishman beside me was called on-
to the floor with a small japanese
in ancient quilted armor as his op-
ponent the japanese was armed
with two short broad-bladed swords
with which he chopped and slashed
at his opponent while denham had
but his thin fragile-looking rapier
yet he evaded all the sweeps and
thrusts of his adversarys blades and
with a sudden lightning stab of the
needlelike rapier he ended the duel
unscathed he came back toward
us jauntily unheedful of the great
applause that followed his feat i
gripped his hand warmly for in the
short time i had known him a sudden
sympathy had sprung up between us
born of the fact of our mutual race
and language in this strange city

there were but few of us left now
who had not already fought and
at an order from the leader of the


weird tales

guards one of these stepped out on
the floor a lithe snaky italian with
beady black eyes and an evil smile
the captain of the guard snapped out
another order looking at me but 
could not understand and looked
around helplessly his face flushed
dark with anger and he started
wrathfully toward me but the eng-
lishman intervened with rapid ex-
planations

  you are to fight talerri he
said indicating the italian and a
wave of icy cold swept over me for
a moment then reccded here
take my sword he continued draw-
ing and handing it to me and be
fearful of foul fighting talerri was
one of caesar borgias bravos and is
a dangerous swordsman full of
treacherous tricks

  half dazed i gripped the rapiers
hilt and walked out to face the ital-
ian good luck called denham
behind me but i did not look back

  as i strode out to where the ital-
ian awaited me i dimly saw the
curving walls the ruddy lights and
the white faces of those at the tables
turned toward me the whole scene
misted before my eyes then cleared
and into my vision came the face of
talerri who was regarding me with
a derisive smile and the realization
came to me coldly and clearly that
unless i killed my opponent he would
kill me

  i raised the blade in my hand i
had been a skilful fencer in my days
at the university but had not han-
dled a foil for years yet the long
slender rapier was much like a foil
itself and as i twirled it in my
grasp some little confidence came to
me i glanced back momentarily
and saw denham smiling encourag-
ingly at me and now the italian
advanced toward me the same hate-
ful smile passing over his face as he
saw me raise the rapier to meet him

  at the first clash of our blades i
knew myself facing a master of

swordsmanship one who was doubt-
less in constant practise so i threw
all my efforts into staving off his first
lightning rushes though to this day
i wonder that i was able to do so
his point seemed to stab at me simul-
taneously from a dozen different po-
sitions and i parried more by in-
stinct than by design as it was
his blade passed twice through my
shirt so close was it but after that
first series of flashing rushes the
italian drew back for a moment and
we circled warily

  again he came on with a light-
ning feint at my heart as my ra-
pier flashed down to foil the stroke
his own stabbed upward in a straight
thrust intended to pierce through
my left eye to the brain it was a
stab that could not be parried but
instinctively i swerved my head
aside from that flashing point and
missing the eye his blade grazed
along the left side of my forehead
sending a stream of blood trickling
down my cheek at sight of that red
stream a shout of approval- crashed
out from the tables

  but now anger was rising in me
and ceasing to stand only on the de-
fensive i thrust out savagely at my
opponent he gave back a little un-
der my unexpected attack but sud-
denly i felt very tired and knew that
the combat must end soon if it was
to end in my favor as i thrust and
parried there the walls and lights
and faces around me faded from
view and replacing them came the
long sky-lighted gymnasium where i
had learned to fence i seemed to
hear the clicking foils and stamping
feet there and the voice of our trim
little instructor explaining the most
difficult of all thrusts the time-
thrust steadiness and accuracy were
the very foundations of that difficult
play i knew and it would be sheer
madness for one as weary and rusty
at sword-play as myself to try it but
as wte surged back and forth on the
the tme-raider



smooth floor i decided that it was
my only chanee for the italian was
pressing me ever more closely

  watching for a favorable oppor-
tunity i dropped my guard for a
single instant leaving my heart ex-
posed instantly talerris blade
darted in like a striking serpent his
whole body behind that straight stab
my own rapier was extended toward
him and in the split-second before
his point touched me my own blade
clicked gently against his deflecting
it to one side where it passed harm-
lessly by me while the momentum of
his leaping rush brought him right
onto my outstretched rapier spitting
him i felt the blade rip through
him as through a man of sawdust the
hilt rapping against his ribs i jerked
it forth and he choked gasped and
fell to the floor dead

  there was a shattering roar of ap-
plause from all around and tired
and sickened i stumbled back to the
group of fellow captives at the floors
edge where denham greeted me
eagerly while he congratulated me
on my victory the others in the
group looked at me with something
of respect on their fierce faces

  weary from the hours on the time-
car and half-nauseated by the blood-
shed i had seen and taken part in i
sank down onto a step and watched
without interest the remaining two
combats when these were finished
another order was given and we were
hurried back down the stairs up
which we had come conducting us
down a different corridor the guards
separated us thrusting us in pairs
into small cells along the corridor

  i had hoped to be placed in the
same cell as denham for i wanted
much to speak further with him but
luck was against me and i was paired
off with the blond giant who had
killed the arab in the first combat
a vicious shove sent us reeling into
the little room and behind me i
heard the thick metal door clang shut

chapter 

prisoned

for ten days i lay in that little
cell prisoned with the big north-
man at my first inspection of the
place i saw that there was no possi-
bility of escape for the walls were of
smooth stone and the only opening
in them was that of a two-inch pipe
that served to ventilate the cell
there was no window as we think of
it yet the room was light enough in
the daytime for as the sun rose the
side of the cell facing on the build-
ings outer wall became invisible al-
lowing plenty of light to enter this
explained a fact that had puzzled
me the absence of windows on the ex-
teriors of the cylindrical buildings of
the city evidently the people of the
city treated the outside walls of their
buildings in such a manner that in
daylight they were invisible from the
inside while perfectly opaque when
viewed from without

  i had other evidence of the scien-
tific attainments of these people in
the food that was furnished us twice
each day that food was nothing but
a clear golden liquid with a slight
oily flavor but otherwise tasteless
yet i found that it contained all the
food-elements necessary for the hu-
man body since in all my time in
this strange city i had no other food
and never felt need of any other

  i found my cell-mate a dull enough
companion he was morose and
fierce in disposition and very sus-
picious of me i think that he con-
sidered me a spy i found that he
knew a little english a strange
archaic english but enough for us
to carry on a broken conversation
to all my eager questions though
the fellow replied with a cold stare
by this time i felt convinced that
lantin and i had found in this city
the home of the raider since the
fact of denhams presence and that
of these other men of many times


weird tales

and races admitted of no other ex-
planation yet when i asked the
norseman how he had come here or
if he had ever seen the raider he
kept to a gloomy silence and i cursed
my luck in being confined with such
a suspicious companion

  one service though he did do for
me and that was to teach me the
strange language used by the guards
and masters of the city around me
that tongue i learned was the kan-
lar tongue while the bright-haired
master-race of the city were kanlars
the language itself was not hard to
learn and in the long hours i lay im-
prisoned i acquired considerable
facility in expressing myself in it

  sometimes too the norseman
would break his silence and growing
excited with his own words would
tell me long interminable stories of
the wild adventures he had taken
part in the shield-ringed ships that
he had sailed in to leave fire and
death along peaceful coasts the long
list of men he had slaughtered his
cold eyes burned as he related tales
of butchery that appalled me but
when  ventured to interject a single
question he would regard me stonily
and then relapse into silence again

  the days went by and through the
transparent wall i watched night
give way to dawn dawn to noon and
noon to dusk and night much i
thought of lantin in those days i
wondered what fate had been his
in the gigantic central building
whether he was alive or dead won-
dered too if i would ever find that
out for it was evident that we were
being reserved for another gladiator-
ial battle and  was not confident of
coming through again unscathed

  one thing occurred in those days
of imprisonment which still makes
me shudder sometimes at the mem-
ory of it the transparent side of
our cell faced a smooth expanse of
green lawn with gardens beyond it
and most of my time i spent loung-

ing against it looking out very few
people passed by there now and
then a few slaves but scarcely ever
any of the ivanlar people so on the
eighth day of my confinement when
i saw a slave approaching from a dis-
tance i moved over to the invisible
wall and watched him

  he was carrying a tool that looked
much like a common garden-hoe and
walked toward me with that stiff
rigid movement that marked the
white-robed slaves he came closer
i glanced at his face then reeled back
against the side of the cell for it
was talerri

  it was the italian i had killed eight
days before garbed as a slave and
walking with the same inhuman pup-
petlike motion that all these strange
servants used he came closer to-
ward me so that i could see his star-
ing eyes then with an angular move-
ment he turned aside and passed
from view along the buildings side

  for hours i puzzled over it reject-
ing with a certain panic fear the one
explanation that came to mind i
knew that i had killed the italian
that night for my sword had pierced
clean through his heart yet here he
was working as a slave for the kan-
lars and what of the other slaves
then these rigid staring-eyed fig-
ures were they too-

  for hours i speculated on the
thing but could find no rational ex-
planation for it nor would the norse-
man enlighten me finally i gave it
up as a mystery beyond me and
strove to banish it from my mind

  two more days dragged out days
that were like weeks to me i felt
that i must soon go mad if i were
longer imprisoned and then sharp-
ly ending the monotony of dreary
hours there came a summons a sum-
mons that in the end proved to be a
call to an adventure utterly un-
dreamed of by lantin or myself

chapter 

the temple of the raider

all that day i had sensed a tense
activity outside and many times
there was the tramp of feet down the
corridor outside our cell as com-
panies of the guards came and went
as sunset came i stood beside the
transparent wall and watched its
brilliant colors fade from the sky

  overhead now the aircraft of the
kanlars were flickering continuously
past all heading toward the giant
cylinder that stood at the citys cen-
ter and when i scrambled up a little
higher against the wall to get a
glimpse of the street i saw that that
street was crowded with masses of
the armored guards and the staring-
eyed slaves all pressing on toward
the same building

  darkness came and the noise of
activity outside died away so that it
seemed that all the city around us
was deserted nor was there any
sound from the building above us
for all of two hours after the dark-
ness we sat there listening waiting
once i thought i heard a distant
ringing music but decided that my
ears had been deceived then
abruptly there was the stamp of
sandals on the floor of the corridor
and we heard the doors of the cells
along it being opened

  our own was flung wide as we
rose and i saw that a score of the
guards waited outside their leader
ordering us to come out which we
were glad enough to do once in the
corridor i found denham and the
others of the group i had met before
shackled to each other wrist to wrist
in a single file the northman and
myself were fettered to the end of
the line and then we set out a long
file of guards on each side of us
marching us down the corridor and
outside the building

  the big street up which i had come
before was utterly deserted as we

turned into it i looked back along
its length lit with the crimson bulbs
a winding serpent of red light that
stretched away out into the country
beyond the city out to where our
time-car lay hidden in the hills at
the thought of it so fierce a desire
seized me to win back to it and my
own time that had i not been
shackled i would have made a break
for freedom down the empty street
but as it was i had no choice and
followed the others in our fettered
line down the wide street toward the
gigantic cylindrical building at its
end

  that great pile seemed to loom
higher and higher as we drew near
it brilliant winking lights along its
sides outlined it against the gloom
of night a huge erect cylinder of
smooth stone its flat top all of a
thousand feet in width and nearly a
half-mile above the ground obscured
as the immense edifice was by the
darkness yet the vague glimpses i
got of its sky-flung walls staggered
me and we were being marched
directly toward it

  a quarter-mile from the building
the flat street we followed ended
changed to a wide smooth ramp that
led up toward the giant edifice in a
slight upward slant we went up
that ramp the guards still on either
side till we stood under the very
shadow of the gigantic perpendicular
walls and now i saw that the ramp
led up to and through a wide high-
arched entrance cut in the buildings
side much like the entrance of the
cylindrical building where i had been
prisoned

  we passed up and through that
arched entrance and were in a long
tunnel similarly arched and cut
through solid seamless stone it was
a hundred feet in length and as we
passed on down its length it came to
me that this must be the thickness of
the great buildings sides the idea
was too prodigious for speculation


weird tales

even and i shook it off peering
ahead toward the tunnels end where
a ruddy light flooding down from
above marked that end

 a few moments and we had
reached the tunnels mouth and
emerged from it into the vast cylin-
ders interior i swept one startled
glance around that interior then felt
myself staggering reeling falling
the immensity of the place was soul-
shaking bearing down on me with a
weight that seemed physical crush-
ing my thoughts down into nothing
but dazed awe and terror

  i had imagined the buildings in-
terior to be divided partitioned into
apartments but instead the whole
interior was one titanic room shaped
by the outside walls and roof its
sides looming up dimly and vaguely
into a hazy darkness that hid their
upper parts from view alon the
sides were many of the light-emitting
bulbs but these merely burned red
holes in the dimness that surrounded
the buildings interior rather than
illuminated it

  starting at the wall and extend-
ing twenty feet out toward the center
of the room the floor was of black
stone a flat continuous ring of
smooth material that circled the
whole room inside of this ring was
the real floor a single huge disk of
burnished metal smooth as ice and
as seamless over nine hundred feet
in diameter and except for our-
selves who stood on the black ring
near the entrance there was nothing
whatever on black circle or burnished
floor no people tables altar nothing
but the immense expanse of smooth
metal and the comparatively thin
black circle that surrounded it

  i looked up and saw for the first
time the people of the city cut in
the thickness of the prodigious walls
of the building were broad balconies
one above the other ringing the
buildings interior as far up as i
could see in the haze that hung above

and in these balconies were the dwell-
ers of the city kanlars guards and
slaves the lowest balcony which
was only a few feet above the floor
jutted forth in a smaller square gal-
lery a little away from where i
stood and in this projecting square
sat three of the bright-haired kan-
lars the oldest-appearing men i had
yet seen among them two garbed in
long robes of solid crimson while the
others garment was of deepest
black they sat there calmly look-
ing away across the big floor toward
the great halls other side this low-
est gallery and the three directly
above it were filled with the kan-
lars while in the unnumbered gal-
leries above these were the armored
guards and the slaves the only en-
trance to these galleries that i could
see was a single narrow winding
stairway a spiral stairway that be-
gan on the black circle of stone near
the wall and slanted up from balcony
to balcony circling the buildings
sides several times as it spiraled up
and evidently leading up to the very
roof of the place

  while i surveyed the scene other
ragged groups like our own had en-
tered escorted by guards until a
considerable number of us had been
collected there near the entrance
now one of the crimson-robed figures
who sat in the gallery that jutted out
from the lowest balcony rose and
uttered an order my knowledge of
the kanlar language was too rudi-
mentary for me to understand him
but when he had finished and re-
sumed his seat a delighted murmur
swept over the massed crowds in the
balconies

  before i had time to speculate the
captain of the guards who watched
us snapped out brief orders and im-
mediately eight of our number ran
out of the center of the metal floor
where they at once drew their weap-
ons and faced each other in four in-
dividual combats
the time-raider



  in a few minutes the four duels
were over but only three of the con-
testants came back from the floors
center to my surprize then instead
of being re-shackled to the rest of us
the three were handed armor and
weapons like that of the other guards
which they donned at once i began
to understand now the purpose of
these combats evidently the bravest
fighters were weeded out in prelimin-
ary duels such as i had taken part
in and the survivors of these first
battles were then pitted against each
other the victors being adjudged
worthy to enter the company of the
guards but where were these
ragged fighters brought from

  the combats went on always eight
men battling at once and i saw that
our number was growing smaller
very rapidly neither denham nor i
had yet been called on to fight but
my heart was beating rapidly for i
expected each time to be among the
next eight the blades clashed on at
the floors center and group after
group went out from us either to re-
turn and don the armor of the guards
or to be dragged off the floor by
slaves dead or dying the kanlars
in the lower balconies laughed and
chatted as the ragged fighters on the
floor slew each other the massed
guards above shouted their approval
at each shrewd blow and the fight-
ing continued until finally but ten of
our number were left and by a freak
of chance both denham and i were
of that ten

  the fights on the floor ended one
by one and swiftly the guards un-
shackled eight of our number and
thrust them out onto the floor i
stood appalled for the two who
were left were myself and the eng-
lishman 

 while the swords clicked and
flashed out on the floor i stood in a
daze dismayed at the ironical trick
which fate had played me of all the
men in the city i must fight the one

whom alone i knew and liked in a

space of seconds it seemed the four
fights on the floor had ended and the
fetters on my wrists were loosed to-
gether hesitantly denham and i
walked out onto the floor shouts of
applause and encouragement came
down from the balconies for ours
was the last fight and the spectators
wanted an exciting one

standing there at the very center
of the huge building denham and
i faced each other simultaneously
we grasped the hilts of our rapiers
half drew them and then with a
common impulse slammed the blades
back down into their sheaths with-
out speaking my companion stepped
over and flung an arm across my
shoulders then tilted up his head and
favored the spectators in the bal-
conies with an insolent stare

  a howl of rage went up as it be-
came evident that we would not
fight each other a torrent of taunts
and execrations poured down on us
from above but we continued to
lounge arm in arm as nonchalantly
as possible

  out from the black edge of the
floor rushed a half-dozen of the
guards who seized us and hurried us
off the floor amid a storm of abuse
from above instead of returning
with us to the entrance the guards
led us toward the bottom of the
spiraling stair and there stationed
themselves beside us

  the angry cries in the balconies
silenced now and a strange stillness
filled the great hall music began
single thrilling notes like dropping
peals of sound swiftly the lights
began to dim the glowing bulbs in
the walls waning until all things in
the vast room were wrapped in shad-
owy dusk

  the chiming music ceased and
over all that mighty fane was abso-
lute silence with no sound from kan-
lars guards or slaves then in the


weird tales

little projecting gallery where he sat
the black-robed oldster rose and
spoke

  ilis deep heavy voice rolled out
over the vast room with awesome
effect breaking as it did the un-
earthly silence he was chanting
uttering an invocation or prayer
the words came to my ears thick
and blurred so that i understood few
of them but the effect was one of
utter solemnity-the darkness the
massed silent crowds above and that
one deep voice speaking on rising
and falling	

  for minutes the voice rumbled on
then abruptly ceased there was an-
other full minute of the strange si-
lence and a tremendous ringing note
sounded even after it had died the
cchoes of it beat in my ears like
ghostly carillons of tiny elfin
chimes and as it died away there
was a heavy grating sound and the
whole vast metal floor abruptly sank
down some six feet into what ap-
peared to be a gigantic smooth-walled
shaft then slid sidewise with an-
other grating jar vanishing into
some aperture prepared for it and
where the floor had been was now a
tremendous circular abyss a straight-
sided pit of such titanic depth that
looking down into it i fell weakly to
my knees and was seized with sudden
nausea

  i stood on the very edge of the
abyss on the ring of black flooring
that was its rim and down from
that rim the stone sides of the great
shaft fell smoothly to an unguessed
depth far far below i seemed to
see glimmering lights that winked
faintly and i saw too that the
spiral staircase which circled the
great rooms interior from floor to
roof continued on down beneath the
floor and circled around and around
this circular chasm in the same way
winding down into the unguessed
depths below

  i felt denham pulling me back

from the edge of the shaft beside
which i lay dimly i realized that
all in the great building were now
chanting rolling forth the same in-
vocation as the black-robed leader
far above now at the very ceiling or
roof of the cylinder a light bur-
geoned out a burning purple beam
that clove its light down through the
dim haze and shadows around it a
moment it hung there then there was
a faint sigh of wind a puff of icy air
and down straight down from the
vast halls roof there raced like a
misty plummet-the raider

  it flashed down until it hung on a
level with myself in midair poised
at the very center of the circular
abyss and floating there effortlessly
it hung there it-s gray mass chang-
ing fluxing interlacing while at its
center hung the three little orbs of
purple light steady and unwinking
from all the massed thousands on the
balconies a sigh of worship went up

  the chant rolled out louder
fiercer and through it sounded an-
other single ringing note there
was another whistle of wind and the
three purple orbs of the raider
flashed to green while the solid but
fluxing mass of it changed to a spin-
ning cloud of gray vapor that
swirled rapidly around the central
lights another fierce gust of wind
smote me and abruptly the raider
had vanished

  up in the balconies the chant went
on repeated again and again i
saw a sea of white faces above all
turned down toward the spot where
the raider had disappeared min-
utes passed the chanting went on
low vast and deep-toned

  came another buffeting breeze a
tempest of shrill wind-sounds and
with startling suddenness the raider
reappeared flashing back into being
at the same spot where it had van-
ished above the center of the abyss
again the green orbs changed to
purple and its cloudy mass con-
the time-raider



traeted to the shifting but solid form
it had occupied before but now
held in its shapeless self were men
who hung helpless in its grasp it
drifted over to the marble edge of
the abyss and loosed the men it held
then moved back to the pits center

  the chanting swelled out exultant
and i saw the men thus loosed
struggle to their feet and look around
with utter awe and terror they
were five in number three in short
white tunics who looked like men f
ancient greece the other two wizened
little figures with dark skin and long
wispy mustaches either huns or
tartars

  again a ringing note cut through
the chanting and as if in obedience
the raider rose floated up toward
the vast halls roof whence it had
come it disappeared there the
purple light burned for a moment
and vanshied and the chanting
finally ceased

  the bulbs glowed out at once and
light filled the place the crowds in
the balconies began to leave stream-
ing down the narrow staircase toward
the floor before they reached it
however guards had reached and
fettered the five men the raider had
left on the pits edge and they now
brought them over and shackled them
also to denham and me

  our little group stood now on the
very edge of the abysmal shaft
some twenty feet below us there was
a little landing from which the stair
started spiraling down and around
the shaft into the darkness below i
wondered momentarily how the land-
ing was reached but my wonder
ceased as a guard touched a lever in
the wall causing a little metal stair
to unfold swiftly from the side of the
shaft itself a light little series of
steps that connected the black marble
ring of flooring with the landing
below

  at an order from the guards we
stepped onto it down it to the land-

ing and on down the spiral stair
which was cut in the solid rock of
the great shafts sides looking
back i saw the steps down which we
had come fold back into the wall and
a moment later the light from above
was shut out as the great metal floor
of the temple swung back into posi-
tion above us with a grating clash

  our only light now was from bulbs
set in the smooth wall along the
down-winding stair and these gave
hardly enough light to show us the
next steps a low wall about a yard
in height pierced with an ornament-
al design of openings was our only
protection from the abyss on our left
yet the guards still marched us on
around and around the great shaft
in a tremendous falling spiral down
down   

chapter 
the city of the pit

soon a dim pearly light began to
show far below us a light that
puzzled me in the world above i
knew it must be dawn but how this
was connected with the growing
light below if it was so connected
baffled me

  and now we reached the end of
the shaft down whose sides we had
come it ended abruptly and below
on each side lay a great open space
obscured by drifting clouds of mist
but the stair did not end with the
shaft it dropped straight on down
a free unsupported spiral of gleam-
ing metal winding down into the
obscuring mists that hid its lower
length it was an eery thing to see
that gigantic twisted stairway like a
great corkscrew vanishing down into
the mists like some pathway of the
gods from heaven to earth and it
could hardly have been hung there
by less than gods i thought no
metal or material ever known to me
would have been able thus to hold its
unsupported weight in the form of
c

weird tales

this stair yet there it was seemingly
tossed there in godlike indifference to
the laws of mechanics in its way it
was as great a wonder as the great
bidding above as that thought
came to me the light around us be-
gan to grow to redden like the sun-
rise and the mists cleared drifted
away in masses vanished and there
beneath me lay the pit

  i can only describe that pit by say-
ing that it was like the inside of a
round squat bottle the neck of the
bottle being the shaft down which i
had come this great cavern below
me was roughly circular in shape all
of four miles in diameter and a mile
from its level floor to its glowing
roof for that roof was glowing
looking up at it as we marched on
down i saw that set in it were scores
of brilliant globes of glass from
which a flood of growing light
golden light sunlight daylight was
pouring down

  i saw now that the spiral stair
down which we marched reached
down to the pits floor and touched
it near its center and i saw too
that all of the great caverns floor
from one towering side to another
was covered with mass on mass of
white roofless buildings of all
shapes covering the floor of the pit
and huddling closely beneath the per-
pendicular walls of smooth rock

  at the center of this great mass of
buildings directly below us was a
great open clearing or plaza and it
was there that the stairway touched
the pits floor and from this plaza
clear to the circling walls nine
streets branched out radiating in
every direction like the spokes of a
wheel along those streets moved
great masses of men and these were
the dwellers in the city the people of
the pit

  so it was that i looked first on the
city of the pit the city of the raider
and its people over whom his shad-
ow had been cast and looking i

wondered if there in the massed
crowds below were lantin and can-
nell and if it were possible to find
them here

  again our guards ordered us for-
ward and we marched on but now
only a low wall on each side pro-
tected us from the abyss and there
was no wall on the right side against
which to cling but our guards
seemed to mind this not at all and i
judged that they had made many
trips up aiid down the stair to be
thus hardened to its dangers

 as we descended denham ex-
plained to me in a low voice the ori-
gin of the lights on the roof these 
were merely lenses of a kind he said
which diffused into the cavern real
sunlight brought from above i had
already seen and puzzled at the glass
globes set on pedestals through the
city of cylinders above but now saw
their purpose those globes received
the sunlight transmitted it in some
unknown fashion down to the globes
on the roof which gave it forth
again thus it was that day and
night in the pit were the same as in
the world above and the light there
waxed and waned in accordance with
the rising and setting of the sun
which these people never saw

  we drew closer and closer toward
the ground and now i saw that at
the stairs end where it touched and
debouched on the pits floor it was
closed by a high heavy gate of
metal barred and spiked and that on
our own side of this gate was a force
of some fifty of the guards armed
with long spears and also with curi-
ous little cylinders of shining metal
which they carried in their belts and
which i guessed were weapons of a
kind unknown to myself

 as we came down toward them
these guards drew aside and un-
locked the big gate our own cap-
tors unshackled us and then pushed
us through it unceremoniously so
that we stood in the clearing or plaza
the time-raider



and the gate was quickly shut and
locked behind us

  standing there i forgot all else in
the fascination of the scene around
me across the open plaza which
was smoothly floored with stone a
great multitude of people were
coming and going and it was that
shifting throng that held my gaze
for in it were men of every race and
land and time men of the far past
and men of my own time all seized
and brought here by the raider to
mix and mingle in one vast varie-
gated throng even that first glance
showed me that there must be
thousands tens of thousands of men
prisoned in this gigantic under-city
and it showed me too that even as
among the guards and slaves above
there were no women all were com-
paratively young men few being over
middle age and nearly all had the
appearance of warriors

  men of a thousand different cen-
turies passed and repassed there be-
fore my eyes men who had been
flashed through the ages and brought
there by the same alien being that
had seized cannell before my eyes
and that had seized only a few hours
before the five newcomers who had
come down the great stair with den-
ham and me

  for these these crowds and masses
of men that choked the streets and
squares and buildings of this city of
hell these were the spoils of the
raider gathered together for some
unholy purpose of his own and pris-
oned here in the pit far beneath the
city of the kanlars in a living
panorama of the past they streamed
by me a brilliant barbaric throng

 many of them were unknown in
race to me but many others i could
reeognize by their dress or features
there were egyptians shaven-
headed men in long white robes
strangely aloof and silent in that
noisy gathering they carried short
swords and bows and i noticed that

every one of the figures that passed
before me wore weapons of some sort
i saw assyrians here and there
ravagers of the ancient world wolf-
faced black-bearded men with burn-
ing eyes clad in strange armor

 three courtly spade-bearded
spaniards sauntered by carrying
themselves as proudly as on the day
when their galleons ruled the seas a
hulking shock-headed savage clad in
evil-smelling skins shambled by with
a giant gnarled club in his hand his
receding brow and jutting jaw pro-
claiming him a troglodyte a man of
the worlds dawn and right behind
him came two stem-faced men in
medieval armor with the cross of the
crusaders blazoned on their battered
shields

  indians passed with bow and tom-
ahawk hawk-faced and alert clear-
skinned greeks laughing at some
jest of their own chinese quiet and
inscrutable whose eyes narrowed
even further as they caught sight of
the two wizened tartars who had
come down the stair with us a tall
frontiersman in suit of buckskin
with bowie knife in his belt strode
past conversing with a helmed phe-
nician sea-captain and everywhere
clustering always together in little
groups were romans legionaries in
tunic breastplate and helmet with
bronze short-swords who looked con-
temptuously on all other races in the
passing throng

a hand descended on my shoulder
and i turned startled to find
that i had completely forgotten the
englishman denham who stood be-
hind me

  deuced strange at first isnt
it he asked smilingly gesturing
toward the moving pageant of the
past around us before i could
answer he went on youd best
come with me now

  where i asked

  why to my own barracks he


weird tales

answered thats what these build-
ings are for you know but as a new-
comer youd be in trouble here in a
minute without someone to answer
for you and too i want you to
meet my own friends

  he looked at me more sharply   i
take it that youre no great friend

of- and he stopped raising his

eyes eloquently upward

  the raider i asked and when
he nodded i said not i im here
to find a man-two men

  find a single man here asked
denham sweeping his hand around
the crowded streets in a hopeless
gesture  its impossible and what
would you do when you found him
escape that too is impossible
how would you get up the stair
through the city of the kanlars
and even if you achieved the impos-
sible and did get through there
would be no place to go for all
around the city above is nothing but
wild uninhabited country where they
would easily hunt you down

  no matter i told him once i
got clear of the city above i could
make good my escape

  he looked at me with sudden in-
terest so he murmured and
perhaps if my friends and i could

help you- but then he cheeked

himself i must see them he
said before saying more

  i nodded a new line of thought
opening up to me and then with
denham leading we went on down
one of the branching streets in that
street was a replica of the noisy
motley throng that filled the plaza
and their cries filled the air with a
babel of a thousand different tongues
i noted though that many spoke in
the language of the kanlars and
guessed that it was that tongue which
served more or less as a means of
communication between the thou-
sands gathered here a supposition i
later found to be correct

  most of the buildings along the
street seemed to be the barracks den-
ham had spoken of housing the citys
occupants though some of them ap-
peared to be wine-shops of a sort
judging from the drunken men who
reeled out of them an inquiry to
my companion elicited the informa-
tion that the only food of the city
was the same golden liquid which had
been furnished me above and which
i learned was made artificially di-
rectly from the soil itself thus the
cycle of foodstuffs in my own time
where a plant draws its substance
from the soil and is then eaten or
where an animal feeds  the plants
sprung from the soil to be eaten by
us in turn was entirely eliminated
by the kanlars who manufactured
their food directly from the soil it-
self recasting the chemical composi-
tion of it to produce the yellow fluid
this yellow liquid i learned was
made by slaves in the city above and
was piped down to the city below and
dispensed to the hordes there in the
little buildings which i had assumed
to be wine-shops it seemed that
while the stuff was a perfect food
when taken in small quantities yet
when an excess was drunk it pro-
duced a violent intoxication and as
it was dispensed freely it was not
wonderful that there were great de-
bauches of drunkenness in this
under-metropolis

  one result of that we saw for all
along the street there was fighting
deadly battles between men of far-
differing times and races there was
no interference in these combats for
there were none of the guards or
kanlars through all the city the oc-
cupants being left to fight their own
battles on the principle of the sur-
vival of the fittest an excited ring
of spectators was gathered round
each combat shouting at and cheer-
ing the opponents not dispersing
until the fighting was over as we
passed the scene of one such duel i
the time-raider



saw the victor dragging away the
body of his late enemy

  where is he taking it i asked
of denham motioning toward the re-
ceding figure

  to the bottom of the stair was
his answer there is an iron rule
that in any battle where a man is
killed the victor must carry the body
of his opponent to the stair and hand
it over to the guards there

  but why i asked for burial
above  

 denham smiled grimly you
saw the slaves in the city above he
said but did you notice how
strange they were how glassy-eyed
and stiff-moving

  when i nodded he said well
the slaves of the city above are men
who have been killed here in the
under-city

  at my exclamation of horror he
repeated his statement man he
exclaimed you do not know the
power of the kanlars with the wis-
dom tiiat is theirs such an accom-
plishment is childs-play

  but how done i asked

  ask them he answered darkly
in some way they are able to bring
back the breath of life into the dead
men to repair the wounds that killed
them they can make them live
again but not even the kanlars can
bring back their souls they are just
living walking bodies whom the
kanlars are able to control and to
force to work their will in all things
dead-alive and slaves to the kan-
lars   

  i shuddered deeply for the idea
was soul-sickening yet i knew now
that denham spoke truth for i re-
membered how from my cell in the
city above i had seen talerri garbed
as a slave talerri whom i had
killed myself it was an invention
that would have aroused pride in the
fiends of lowest hell thus to raise
dead men back to life and use them

as servants and i knew that this
was but one of the dark evils that lay
concealed under the rule of the laugh-
ing bright-haired kanlars

while we talked we had been
moving along the crowded
street toward the distant wall of the
pit finally very near that wall
denham turned in at a low long
building that was of white stone and
roofless like most others in the city
i followed him inside and looked
around curiously

  the buildings interior was a single
large room shaded from the light
above by a suspended awning of
green cloth ranged along the walls
was a triple tier of metal bunks in
some of which lay cloth and fur
robes there was a long metal table
at the rooms center and lounging in
chairs around it and in the bunks
were a score of men who looked up
without interest as we entered

  denham greeted them and in reply
they grunted lazily looking at me in-
curiously i followed my companion
to the farther end of the room where
he seated himself in one of the bunks
and motioned me to join him

  my friends arent here now he
said  but theyll return before
long  

  a sudden curiosity prompted my
next question how did you get
here denham i asked was it
-the raider

  naturally he answered it
was the raider as you call it that
brought us all here curse him it
was in the colonial rebellion he got
me  

  the american rebellion i
asked striving to understand his
eighteenth century allusions

  of course he answered we
were quartered in philadelphia
under that old fool howe he liked
the city yknow the bottle and the
ladies but the rest of us were itch-
ing for fight and since we couldnt
g-

weird tales

fight the rebels we soon took to fight-
ing one another

  there was a ball one night and
toward the end of it i began to have
a few words with a hessian attached
to our staff we were both a little
scrambled by then curse me if
there werent some fine cellars there
but as to the german he and i got
hotter and hotter until he finally
made the assertion that our com-
mander was a fool personally that
was my opinion also but i couldnt
allow the dutchman to say so and
the upshot of it was that we left the
ball together and adjourned to an
open field near by to resume the
argument with our swords

  before we had made a half-dozen
passes there was a hellish sound of
wind a big gray cloud with burning
green eyes seemed to drop down on
us from above and then the bottom
dropped out of the world when we
came to our senses we were standing
up there in the big temple with a
dozen others of course we didnt
know then that we had been brought
on through time but we knew it was
a damned strange place

 they brought us down here
down the stair and as soon as we
were turned loose here we resumed
our dispute borrowing swords from
two bystanders by luck i pinked
him there was a big crowd around
cheering us on and it was then that
i met dalord who is one of the
friends i mentioned

  as denham finished his story i
began to feel a sudden utter weari-
ness for i had not slept for many
hours i yawned and rubbed my
eyes and at once denham jumped
up

  why take the bunk man he
ordered me go ahead and sleep

  but what of lantin i asked
my friend hes somewhere in the
city here im sure and i must find
him

  denham shook his head doubtfully

what does he look like he asked

  when i had described lantin to
him his face cleared a little i
thought an elderly man you
said he questioned and when i
nodded he continued that should
make it easier to find him then
there are hardly any but young men
here so your friend would be more
conspicuous and easily located but
you go ahead and sleep and ill find
my friends and look for your com-
panion if anyone can find him we
can  

  i tried to thank him but he waved
my words aside with a smile and
walked out of the room i sank back
in the bunk and closed my eyes as
drowsiness overcame me there came
to my ears the dull sound of voices
of the men in the room with now and
then a shout or bellow of laughter
and even these faded from hearing
as i sank contentedly enough down
into the green depths of sleep

chapter 

plans for escape

golden light again streamed
through the windows when i
finally woke and i realized that in
my utter weariness i must have slept
the clock twice round i swung out
of the bunk and stood up stretching

  there was only one man in the
long room besides myself a man who
sat at the table some distance away
from me as i looked at him he
turned saw me and jumped up and
hurried over toward me

  lantin i cried extending my
hands he gripped them his eyes
sparkling

  where have you been i asked
eagerly were you in the city here
all the time

  all the time since i left you he
affirmed they brought me direct-
ly here wheeler and of course when
i got here i knew at once that we had
found the raiders lair your friend
the time-raider



denham found me a few hours ago
and told me where you were but
when i came here i saw that you
were sleeping and didnt waken
you

  you should have i told him
but where is denham now

  hell be here soon replied my
friend he said he would go after
his friends who were helping him to
look for me and bring them here  
but what of cannell lantin i
asked you have seen nothing of
him in your stay here

  his face clouded nothing he
admitted i have searched for him
but how is one to find a single man in
this city of thousands and we do
not even know that he is here
wheeler for all we know he may
have been killed long ago in some
brawl here

  dont give up hope i told him
with denham to help us we have
a far better chance to find him
lantin shook his head doubtfully
but before he could answer our con-
versation was interrupted by the
entrance of denham and his three
friends as they came up to us i
gazed with mounting interest at the
trio of strange companions who ac-
companied the englishman

 one of them was patently a
roman a short sturdy man with
swarthy stem-set features attired
in armor and helmet the man be-
side him was brown-skinned and
long-haired with eagle black eyes
dressed in spotted skins quilted cot-
ton armor and head-dress of feath-
ers he carried a curious long
sword or weapon whose edges were
serrated or saw-toothed and the
weapon gave me the clue to his iden-
tity i had seen swords exactly like
it brought out of the aztec ruins in
mexico

 but it was the third man who
caught and held my gaze he was a
figure of romance a slouch-hatted
wide-booted trooper long sword

rattling at his heels laughing dare-
devil eyes and white teeth gleaming
behind a fierce black mustache as
i surveyed him rather rudely i
think he smiled at me and exclaimed
in execrable english mordieu is
this the lad who killed that pig
talerri

  when denham nodded he thrust
forth his hand impulsively and i
was glad to take it and then den-
ham made introduction the
chevalier raoul dalord he said
indicating the laughing trooper who
swept me a grand bow one time
captain in the armies of henry
quatre king of navarre and france
but now a lodger in our pleasant
city and he laughed at the wry
face the frenchman made

  this is ixtil cacique of tlaco-
pan he went on indicating the
wild brown figure in the middle and
i looked at him with renewed inter-
est now that my surmise had proved
correct an aztec one of the fierce
hordes who had swept away maya
and toltee forever only to be crushed
in turn by ruthless steel-shod cor-
tes the chieftain bowed to me
gravely and silently but did not
speak

  denham turned to the remaining
figure fabrius arminius he
said formerly centurion in the le-
gions of tiberius cepsar and the
roman stiffly inclined his head then
at denhams suggestion we seated
ourselves around the end of the long
table

  dalord speaks english as well
as i do said denham and be-
tween us we taught it to ixtil and
fabrius so you can speak freely i
have told my friends that you are
like ourselves ready for an attempt
at escaping naturally though they
would like to hear it from your own
lips

  it is so i assured them lan-
tin and i came here to find a certain
man and if we can find him well


weird tales

take him out of here in spite of the
raider  

  the raider queried dalord
and denham interjected a brief ex-
planation he means-him he
told the frenchman jerking a thumb
upward

 the trooper laughed sacre
thats a name for the beast eh
fabrius

  the roman nodded silently and
denham came back to the subject
for some time he went on we
four have considered different plans
for escaping but none has been prac-
tical there are so many obstacles
it will be necessary to get up the
stair avoiding the guards at bottom
and top once up it will be neces-
sary to pass through the city of the
cylinders though that should not be
too difficult but once out of the
city what then how cross the
ice   

  we are talking at cross pur-
poses i said you must remem-
ber denham that i know next to
nothing about this place why have
all these men been collected in this
under-city does anyone know ex-
cept the raider what is the pur-
pose of it all

  you do not know asked den-
ham in surprize i thought you
would by now these men these
thousands of warriors in the city
here around you have been gathered
here by the raider to act as his
armies his mercenaries to potir down
in hordes upon the cities of the ene-
mies of the kanlars and destroy
those enemies utterly which the kan-
lars are too few in number to do

  i gasped with astonishment den-
ham went on you tell him fab-
rius he said addressing the roman
you have been here longer than
any of us

  the centurion spoke in a slurred
accented english some things i
have heard he said but whether
true or not i can not say there

was a man here i knew when first i
was brought here a persian before
he was killed for he was killed in a
drunken brawl he told me that once
in the city above one of the kanlars
had become drunk and had babbled
to him the story of his race

  as you know endless fields of
ice lie around this land where is the
kanlars city well the persian
said that these fields of ice were not
endless that far to the south there
were other green lands and in them
a mighty people and a mighty city
named kom he said that long ago
the kanlars lived in this city and
were of its people but that trouble
had risen between them and the other
people of kom because of the raider
more than this he did not know but
said that because of this trouble the
kanlars had fled from the city with
the raider leading them and coming
north in their air-boats over the ice-
fields had found this green unin-
habited land set in the ice its ex-
istence had never been suspected by
those in kom who thought that the
ice extended clear north to the very
edge of earth

  so the kanlars had settled here
and had built the city of cylinders
which lies above us but still they
planned to sweep back on kom and
annihilate all there but this they
could not do being too few in num-
ber so the raider who is their god
and their king spoke to them and
said that he would bring them men
from every age of earths past to be
their servants to fight for them at
will the raider could travel at will
through time-ask me not how-and
he swept back through the centuries
and brought men by the thousands
to the kanlars young warriors to
fight their battles for them

    there was a great cavern far be-
neath the city of the kanlars a great
hollowr space formed by inside shift-
ings of the young earth and in this
the kanlars prisoned the men brought
the time-raider



by the raider piercing a shaft down
to it from their temple above and
placing in that shaft the stairway
down which you came under the
direction of the raider they chose
from among their prisoners some to
be guards of the others and those
killed in battle here they brought
back to seeming life by their arts of
hell and used as slaves

  so steadily the hordes here in
the pit have grown in number until
scarcely more could be contained
here soon there will be enough to
suit the purpose of the raider and
then they will be loosed and hurled
south to carry fire and death to the
cities beyond the ice to kom and the
people of kom who can have no
knowledge whatever of the peril that
hangs over them up on the great
roof of the temple which is the home
of the raider there are scores of
great flying platforms which the
kanlars have been constructing
they have made strange weapons
too and so when their hour strikes
they will open the gates here and
allow the hordes to pour up the stair
up to the roof of the temple where
they will crowd into the flying plat-
forms under the leadership of the
kanlars and race south over the ice
to rain down death and destruction
on kom and thus will the raider
and the kanlars be revenged upon
the people who cast them out

labrius stopped and i looked at
lantin then back toward the
roman was this the true secret of
the raiders activity

 but will the hordes here do
this i asked will they follow
the kanlars and obey them

 fabrius laughed shortly and
dalord replied for him ha
friend he said to me you are new
here and do not know these men
they are evil i tell you they boast
always of what they will do when
they are loosed on kom for they

know that soon they are to be thus
loosed some subtle poison from the
raiders self has entered into them
i think they are like tigers waiting
to be freed upon a helpless prey
it is so said lantin for short
a time as i have been here i have
found that this is so there is no
hope from the hordes here in the pit
for they will follow the raider to a
man  

  there was a silence after that
suddenly denham spoke i think
it would be possible for some of us at
least to get out of the pit here he
said for i have a plan that would
effect that much but what then
do you suppose it would be possible
to get up to the roof of the temple
and steal one of the flying platforms
you speak of or steal one of the
kanlars air-boats if we could do
that we could fly south over the ice-
fields and warn the cities there of
their peril get their aid and come
back and crush the raider and these
damned kanlars

  for the first time the aztec spoke
shaking his head it can not be
done he said speaking in precise
queery clipped english i was to
the roof of the tempte once and
know the only way to get to that
roof is by the narrow stairway that
spirals up the inside of the temple
and that stairway leads directly
through the lair of the raider
but what can we do then
asked the englishman it would be
folly to try to steal one of the kan-
lars air-boats for they always rise
from and alight on the roofs of build-
ings and we could never get to them
unobserved

  lantin broke into the silence that
ensued but suppose there was an
air-boat hidden back in the hills out-
side the city he said that would
make things easier wouldnt it
when they assented he went on
quickly wheeler and i have such a
machine hidden he said and it


weird tales

was on it that we came here from our
own time

  they looked up eagerly incredu-
lously do you mean that you came
into this age from your own time on
a machine asked denham that
you came yourselves and were not
brought here by the raider like all
the rest of us

  lantin nodded affirmation and
then went on to describe briefly the
seizure of cannell our pursuit
through time and our subsequent
capture outside the city by the
guards they listened fascinated
and when he had finished dalord
asked with something of awe in his
voice and you made this machine
yourselves you found the secret of
the raiders time-traveling

  it is so lantin told them we
made the time-car and then came
after cannell

  god exclaimed the trooper
  what a chance for freedom if we
could all win free of this pit eseape
from the city to your car we could
get back to our own times in it back
to france

  no said denham decisively
in the first place not all of us can
escape from the pit i have a plan
by which some of us can but the rest
must stay here and another thing
even if we each got back to our own
time dalord who knows but that
the raider would come back and re-
capture us as he did this cannell
they tell of for all we know the
raider may have placed on us some
sign or mark by means of which he
could track us down through the
ages again and until he is de-
stroyed it will be of no use to return
to our own times

  but what to do then asked the
frenchman

  this said denham we four
will help lantin and wheeler to es-
cape from the pit only two can
succeed in escaping by my plan for

more would be noticed in the city
above and we four will be needed to
give them their start up the stair
how i will explain later and since
only one or two can escape lantin
and wheeler must be the ones to
make the attempt since they alone
know how to operate their machine
and know where it is hidden

  if they can reach their car they
will speed south across the ice warn
the people of kom of the plans of the
kanlars and come back with a force
sufficient to crush the raider and the
kanlars forever and then they can
rescue us four from the pit

  the plan is good approved the
roman we four must stay while
they go when do you plan to make
the attempt he asked denham

  we must wait until the night
will be moonless he said for the
darkness will favor the attempt the
eighth night from today would be
best  

  but your plan asked the im-
patient frenchman how do you
plan to get up the stair

  in this manner explained the
englishman we must make a
grappling-hook of heavy metal and
a long strong rope on the night
we select for the attempt we four
will assemble at the lower gate of the
stair while lantin and wheeler take
up a position at the plazas edge di-
rectly under the lowest curve of the
spiral stair then by shouting or
fighting we four shall create a riot
around the gate to draw the atten-
tion of the guards inside when the
excitement is at its highest and when
the people around the position of
lantin and wheeler have run toward
the riot as they always do here then
wheeler will fling up the grappling-
hook toward the curving stair above
him if fortune favors us the hook
will catch he can ascend the rope
and pull up lantin and the two can
then proceed on up the stair being
above the gate and its guards
the time-raider

  but the guards above dalord
objected how pass them and
what of the metal floor of the temple
which covers the shaft it will be
closed and how will they get through
it

  no said denham for if we
start a sufficiently large riot at the
gate of the stair the guards behind
it will become alarmed and call for
help from above they have a sys-
tem of signaling with those above and
if they think the hordes here are
going to attack the gate those above
will open the shaft by swinging aside
the temple floor and will send guards
down to repel the attack on the gates
the shaft being open and the guards
gone lantin and wheeler should
have no trouble getting out and
through the city to their car

  but we will meet the guards com-
ing down the stair  i cried

  not so denham assured me
for when there is a call for aid from
their fellows below the guards above
dont descend by the stair since it
would take them too long they un-
reel great ropes or cables drop them
over the shafts edge so that they
hang clear to the stairs bottom and
then attach a sort of harness to them-
selves join that harness to the cables
with special pulleys and slide down
to the stairs bottom in a few min-
utes twice since i have been here
there have been riots around the
gate and each time the guards above
came whizzing down in that way to
repel the riot

  whatever else they are added
dalord there are no cowards
among the guards no one ever
called me craven yet but ventre-de-
biche id look twice before sliding
down a rope into this hell

  yet what if some of the guards
did come down the stair i asked

  denham shook his head i do
not think they will do so he said
yet if they did i insisted

  he shrugged his shoulders why

then you would meet them on the
stair

  we looked at each other a little
grimly i think and then there was a
shattering roar of laughter from
dalord why borrow trouble
he cried take your sword with
you lad and if you meet anyone on
the stair have at him if you are
the stronger you will kill your
enemies and if your enemies are the
stronger they will kill you what
more is there to it

  i could not help laughing ruefully
as did the rest but lantin suddenly
sobered

  but cannell he asked what
of my friend we came here to res-
cue him you know and cant leave
without him

  theie are eight days yet in which
to find him denham pointed out
and if you can not find him in that
time we four will try to locate him
after you and wheeler have escaped
if hes here in the pit well have him
with us by the time you come back

our conversation was abruptly
broken off by the entrance of a
number of the rooms occupants who
regarded our little group with sus-
picious stares

  wed best break up denham
whispered for we dont want it to
get abroad that were planning
something  

  so rising wre sauntered out of the
room into the street outside a hot
sunlight was pouring down from the
glass globes in the roof so strongly
that one could not look up at that
roof directly any more than one can
look directly at the sun whatever
method the kanlars had devised to
collect and bring so far underground
the light and heat of the sun it was
a wonderfully efficient one

  behind us loomed the gray-rock
wall of the pit and before us
stretching away for miles to the op-


weird tales

posite wall were the masses of white
buildings that housed the citys
teeming thousands and at the cen-
tral plaza the titanic gleaming
spiral of the metal stairway rose
vastly up toward the black round
shaft that pierced the caverns roof
its winding turn on turn glinting in
the light like a huge upraised ser-
pent of metal

  in the shifting noisy throng that
pressed by us along the street that
swirled aimlessly through streets and
buildings i sensed a quality of ex-
pectation of eager restless waiting
even i new to the city as i was
could feel the unwonted excitement
that pulsed from the passing crowds
and i saw that my companions felt
it likewise

  a grizzled seaman in stained
shapeless clothes who might have
sailed with drake or hawkins
stopped in front of us

  ho comrade he cried to den-
ham hast heard the news

  news what news asked den-
ham his brows drawing together

  an hour ago said the other
the guards sent word through the
city to sharpen all swords to get all
weapons ready i tell thee lad its
soon we  be dropping down on kom
to loot it from end to end split me
theyre going to loose us ere long
and with an anticipatory gloating
chuckle the seaman passed on

  denham turned to us his face sud-
denly white you heard he
asked that means that we have
little time left for action we dare
not wait now until the moonless
nights well have to take our
chance on the first night that its
cloudy above for then it will be
darker here and if we fail in our
attempt it means these hordes of
devils here flashing down to make a
hell of an unwarned unprotected
city for the raider is getting ready
to strike

chapter 

in the pit

the hours the days that followed
i remember now as one remem-
bers a particularly vivid dream for
even at the time i seemed to see all
in the city around me through the
haze of assured impossibility that
surrounds a dream and although
i can well understand how the city in
the pit was a very hell on earth to
those long confined in it yet to me
during the next few days it was a
city of wonder

  there was little to do but wander
through it each day we waited
tensely for night but always when
night came there came with it a flood
of soft light that poured down re-
vealingly from the roof the moon-
light of the earth above brought
down to us by the glass globes above
and in the roof had it been cloudy
above it would have been dark
enough here in the pit to chance an
attempt but to do so in the brilliant
light was out of the question and
we dared take no more chances than
necessary since if discovered we
should doubtless never live to make
another attempt

  so in the eight days that followed
while denham and his friends fretted
impatiently at the delay i spent the
time roaming through the city
usually with one or all of the four
friends as guide when possible we
preferred to keep together sinee
thus we made up a strong little com-
pany whose five swords deterred
many truculent souls from attacking
us

  even so we were twice involved in
combats from both of which we
managed to emerge victorious though
not unscathed it was a bloody
enough society there in the city of
the pit a wilder life almost than
that of roaming wolves yet it had a
fierce free charm that stirred me at
times a product of civilization
the time-raider



myself i was thrown now into a life
where strength and skill with weap-
ons were the measure of a man and
where all disputes were settled with
swords cooped as we were in the
crowded pit yet we were untram-
meled by any form of law or eti-
quette and i soon learned to swag-
ger as boldly and scowl as ferocious-
ly as any fire-eater in the pit and
too in constant practise with my
friends i learned sword-play well

  i came to love my four new-found
friends in those days four men
out of four different centuries and
different in temperament as they
were yet strong bonds of friendship
sprang up between them and myself
and lantin also

  from the beginning i had felt at-
tracted to denham for he was more
of my own time and way of tliinkng
than the rest fastidious elegant
even in manner and of an indolent
disposition naturally yet he was ter-
ribly quick in battle his slim rapier
flashing out resistlessly even while
he yawned in his opponents face
he was a good bit of a fop and it
was a source of constant mirth to us
to watch him cleaning and patching
his ragged suit and anxiously assur-
ing himself of the fit of the torn coat
but at all our jests he would smile
quietly and go on with his work

  a great deal different was d alord
though he attracted me as much
swearing laughing shouting he
was never quiet never still and even
in the cramped pit lived with a
magnificent gusto that was enviable
he was very quick to take offense
and the rest of us had trouble always
in keeping him from embroiling us
in some senseless quarrel but he was
as quick to forget the cause of
offense and was incapable of holding
a grudge more than the rest of us
he loved fighting for its own sake
and was so much in his element in
the pit that he sometimes declared
that if it were not for the lack of

wine and women he would be content
to stay in the pit forever

  some few years older than the rest
of us was the roman who had fol-
lowed the insignia of his legion over
all the distant frontiers of the
empire from parthia to britain he
was never excited and never unpre-
pared a calm fearless veteran who
made me understand something of
the greatness of his people who
reared up the greatest empire in
history and stamped their language
and their customs on half the world

  strangest of the four perhaps
was the aztec quiet even gentle
when not provoked yet i have never
seen such tigerish fury as he exhib-
ited in battle he had a great name
as a fighter even in that city of war-
riors and was feared by the most
fearless he could handle his saw-
toothed sword with wonderful skill
and quickness and i shuddered at
the gashing wounds he inflicted with
it as staunch and faithful a friend
as i have ever had or seen yet to
those he hated he was a terrible
enemy

 always while we five roamed
through the city we searched for
cannell but found him not i began
to think that after all cannell was
not in the pit for though it was pos-
sible we had missed him in the swirl-
ing hordes it was equally possible
that he had been killed in some com-
bat here or above and that he now
walked dead-alive through the city of
the kanlars as one of the ghastly
white-robed slaves

  but lantin would not believe that
he searched from dawn to darkness
of each day and was not discouraged
when he failed to find his friend he
did not accompany us five in our
rambles through the city preferring
to search alone and though we were
fearful for his safety he was never
molested his obvious elderliness
and the gentleness and inoffensive-
ness of his nature served to protect

him from the constant bullying and
fighting that went on in the pit

  the days dragged past and work-
ing in odd hours when we were not
noticed we managed to make a metal
grappling-hook and a long rope the
hook was much like a triple fishing-
hook large enough to catch on the
wall of the stair and was hammered
out from pieces wrenched from metal
chairs the rope a long and very
strong one was braided from long
strips of torn cloth and was knotted
to make easier an ascent along its
length both rope and hook lay con-
cealed beneath the bunk of dalord
in a cunningly contrived little hid-
ing place there

  so we came at last to the eighth
day the night of which would be
moonless  the earth above with
consequent darkness below as the
day wore on we grew increasingly
nervous with the exception of
fabrius who appeared as imperturb-
able as ever finally the light from
the roof waned and died and a thick
darkness settled down on the city a
darkness relieved only by one or two

of the glowing red bulbs that were
set around the gate of the stair and
along the nine streets

  an hour passed and another and
another then denham rose from
his bunk and sauntered leisurely out
of the room followed in a few min-
utes by dalord and the aztec by
now the bunks were filled with snor-
ing sleepers but as the two went
across the room to the door none of
these stirred so lantin fabrius and
i followed the roman carrying the
hook and rope concealed under his
cloak

  we stepped from the dark room
into a street almost equally dark the
ruddy bulbs set sparsely along its
length accentuating rather than dis-
persing the blackness a few drunk-
en stragglers were wandering along
the street but most of the citys
thousands were slumbering in the
many buildings for few were abroad
in the pit at night

  denham dalord and ixtil were
awaiting us outside and without
speaking our entire little party
moved rapidly down the dark street
toward the plaza and the great stair

the startling adventures of the friends the thrilling flight
to the wonderful city of kom and the sinister
plans of the raider will be described in

           a fearful thing leaped upon him a dreadful purplish shadow-
jwmw thing

i did not begin to see the shad-
ows until i had lived in old
morris house for more than a
week old morris dead and gone
these many years had been the scion
of a still earlier irish settler in santa
cruz of a family which had come
into the island when the danes fail-
ing to colonize its rich - acres had
opened it in the middle of the
eighteenth century to colonists and
younger sons of irish scottish and
english gentry had taken up sugar
estates and commenced that baronial
life which lasted for a century and
which declined after the abolition of
slavery and the german bounty on
beet sugar had started the long

process of west indian commercial
decadence mr morris youth had
been spent in the french islands

  the shadows were at first so vague
that i attributed them wholly to the
slight weakness which began to affect
my eyes in early childhood and
which while never materially inter-
fering with the enjoyment of life in
general had necessitated the use of
glasses when i used my eyes to read
or write my first experience of them
was about  oclock in the morning
i had been at a gentlemens
party at hackers house emer-
ald as some poetic-minded ancestor
of hackers had named the family
estate three miles out of christian-

weird tales

sted the northerly town built on the
site of the ancient abandoned french
town of bassin

  i had come home from the party
and was undressing in my bedroom
which is one of two rooms on the
westerly side of the house which
stands at the edge of the old sun-
day market these two bedrooms
open on the market-place and i had
chosen them rather than the more
airy rooms on the other side because
of the space outside i like to look
out on trees in the early mornings
whenever possible and the ancient
market-place is overshadowed with
the foliage of hundred-year-old
mahogany trees and a few gnarled
otalieites and chinese-bean trees

  i had nearly finished undressing
had noted that my servant had let
down and properly fastened the mos-
quito netting and had stepped into
the other bedroom to open the jalou-
sies so that i might get as much of the
night-breeze as possible circulating
through the house i was coming
back through the doorway between
the two bedrooms and taking off my
dressing gown at the moment when
the first faint perception of what i
have called the shadows made
itself apparent it was very dark
just after switching off the electric
light in that front bedroom i had
in fact to feel for the doorway in
this i experienced some difficulty and
my eyes had not fully adjusted them-
selves to the thin starlight seeping in
through the slanted jalousies of my
own room when i passed through the
doorway and groped my way toward
the great mahogany four-poster in
which i was about to lie down for
my belated rest

  i saw the nearest post looming be-
fore me closer than i had expected
putting out my hand i grasped-
nothing i winked in some surprize
and peered through the slightly in-
creasing light as my eyes adjusted
themselves to the sudden change

yes surely-there was the corner of
the bedstead just in front of my face
by now my eyes were sufficiently
attuned to the amount of light from
outside to see a little plainer i was
puzzled the bed was not where i
had supposed it to be what could
have happened that the servants
should have moved my bed without
orders to do so was incredible be-
sides i had undressed in full electric
light in that room not more than a
few minutes ago and then the bed
was standing exactly where it had
been since i had had it moved into
that room a week before i kicked
gently before me with a slippered
foot against the place where that
bedpost appeared to be standing-
and my foot met no resistance

  i stepped over to the light in my
own room and snapped the button
in the sudden glare everything read-
justed itself to normal there stood
my bed and here in their accustomed
places about the room were ranged
the chairs the polished wardrobe
we do not use cupboards in the west
india islands the mahogany dress-
ing table-even my clothes which i
had hung over a chair where alber-
tina my servant would find them in
the morning and put them they
were of white drill into the soiled-
clothes bag in the morning

  i shook my head light and
shadow in these islands seem some-
how different from what they are
like at home in the united states
the tricks they play are different
tricks somehow

  i snapped off the light again and
in the ensuing dead blackness i
crawled in under the loose edge of
the mosquito netting tucked it along
under the edge of the mattress on
that side adjusted my pillows and
the sheets and settled myself for a
good sleep even to a moderate man
these gentlemens parties are rather
wearing sometimes they invariably
last too long i closed my eyes and
the shadows



was asleep before i could have put
these last ideas into words

in the morning the recollection of
the experience with the bed-being-
in-the-wrong-place was gone i
jumped out of bed and into my
shower bath at half-past  for i had
promised obrien captain of the
u s marines to go out with him to
the rifle range at la grande prin-
cesse that morning and look over the
butts with him i like obrien and
i am not uninterested in the effi-
ciency of uncle sams marines but
my chief objective was to watch the
pelicans out there on the glorious
beach of estate grande princesse
big princess as the black
people call it a colony of pelicans
make their home and it is a never-
ending source of amusement to
me to watch them fish a caribbean
pelican is probably the most graceful
flier we have in these latitudes-
barring not even the hurricane bird
that describer of noble arcs and pa-
rabolas-and the most insanely ab-
surdly awkward creature on land
that providence has cared in a
light-hearted moment to create

  i expressed my interest in captain
obriens latest improvements and
while he was talking shop to one of
his lieutenants and half a dozen en-
listed men he has camped out there
i slipped down to the beach to watch
the pelicans fish three or four of
them were describing curves and
turns of indescribable complexity and
perfect grace over the green water of
the reef-enclosed white beach ever
and again one would stop short in
the air fold himself up like a jack-
knife turn head downward his great
pouched bill extended like the head
of a cruel spear and drop like a
plummet into the water emerging an
instant later with the pouch distend-
ed with a fish

  i stayed a trifle too long-for my
eyes driving back i observed that i

had picked up several sun-spots and
when i arrived home i polished a
set of yellowish sun-spectacles i keep
for such emergencies and put them
on

  the east side of the house had been
shaded against the pouring morning
sunlight and in this double shade i
looked to see my eyes clear up the
sun-spots persisted however in that
annoying recurrent way they have
-almost disappearing and then re-
turning in undiminished kaleido-
scopic grotesqueness-those strange
blocks and parcels of pure color
changing as one winks from indigo to
brown and from brown to orange and
then to a blinding turquoise-blue ac-
cording to some eery natural law of
physics within the fluids of the eye
itself

  the sun-spots were so persistent
that morning that i decided to keep
my eyes closed for some considerable
time and see if that would allow them
to run their course and wear them-
selves out blue and mauve gro-
tesques of the vague general shape
of diving pelicans swam and jumped
inside my eyes it was very annoy-
ing i called to albertina

  albertina said i when she had
come to the door please go into my
bedroom and close all the jalousies
tight keep out all the light you
can please

  ahl roight sir replied the
obedient albertina and i heard her
slapping the jalousie-blinds together
with sharp little clicks

  de jalousie ahl close sir re-
ported albertina i thanked her
and proceeded with half-shut eyes
into the bedroom which not yet in-
vaded with afternoons sunlight and
closely shuttered offered an appear-
ance of deep twilight i lay face
down across the bqd a pillow tinder
my face and my eyes buried in
darkness

  very gradually the diving pelican
faded out to a cube to a dim recur-


weird tales

rent blur to nothingness i raised
my head and rolled over on my side
placing the pillow back where it be-
longed and as i opened my eyes on
the dim room there stood in faint
shadowy outline in the opposite
comer of the room away from the
outside wall on the market-place
side the huge danish bedstead i
had vaguely noted the night before
or rather early that morning

  it was the most curious sensation
looking at that bed in the dimness of
the room i was reminded of those
fourth-dimensional tales which are so
popular nowadays for the bed im-
pinged spatially on my large bureau
and the curious thing was that i
could see the bureau at the same
time i rubbed my eyes a little un-
wisely but not enough to bring back
the pelican sun-spots into them for i
remembered and desisted pretty
promptly i looked fixedly at the
great bed and it blurred and dimmed
and faded out of my vision

  again i was greatly puzzled and
i went over to where it seemed to
stand and walked through it-it
being no longer visible to my now re-
stored vision free of the effects of
the sun-spots-and then i went out
into the hall-a west indian
drawing room is called the hall-
and sat down to think over this
strange phenomenon i could not
account for it if it had been poor
prentice now prentice attended
all the gentlemens parties to
which he was invited with a kind of
religious regularity and had to be
helped into his car with a similar
regularity a regularity which was
verging on the monotonous nowadays
as the invitations became more and
more strained no-in my case it
was if there was anything certain
about it assuredly not the effects of
strong liquors for barring an occa-
sional sociable swizzel i retained
here in my west indian residence
my american convictions that mod-

eration in such matters was a reason-
able virtue i reasoned out the matter
of the phantom bedstead-for so i
was already thinking of it-as far as
i was able that it was a phantom
of defective eyesight i had no reason-
able doubt i had had my eyes ex-
amined in new york three months
before and the oculist had pleased
me greatly by assuring me that there
were no visible indications of de-
terioration in fact dr jusserand
had said at that time that my eyes
were stronger sounder than when
he had made his last examination six
months before

  perhaps this conviction-that the
appearancc was due to my own phys-
ical shortcoming accounts for the
fact that i was not what shall i
say disturbed by what i saw or
thought i saw confront the most
thoroughgoing materialist with a
ghost and he will act precisely like
anyone else like any normal human
being who believes in the material
world as the outward and visible sign
of something which animates it all
normal human beings it seems to me
are sacramentalists

   i was for this reason able to think
clearly about the phenomenon my
mind was not clouded and bemused
with fear and its known physiolog-
ical effects i can quite easily re-
cord what i saw in the course of
the next few days the bed was
clearer to my vision and apprehen-
sion than it had been it seemed to
have grown in visibility in a kind of
substantialness if there is such a
word it appeared more material
than it had before less shadowy

  i looked about the room and saw
other furniture a huge old-fashioned
mahogany bureau with mens heads
carved on the knuckles of the front
legs danish fashion there is pre-
cisely such carving on pieces in the
museum in copenhagen they tell me
those who have seen my drawing of
it i was actually able to do that
the shadows



and had completed a kind of plan-
picture of the room putting in all the
shadow-furniture and leaving my
own actual furniture out thank
the god in whom i devoutly believe
-and know to be more powerful than
the powers of evil-i was able to
finish that rather elaborate drawing
before    well i must not run
ahead of my story

that night when i was ready to re-
tire and had once more opened
up the jalousies of the front bedroom
and had switched off the light i
looked naturally enough under the
circumstances for the outlines of
that ghostly furniture they were
much clearer now i studied them
with a certain sense of almost
scientific detachment it was
even then apparent to me that no
weakness of the strange complexity
which is the human eye could reason-
ably account for the presence of a
well-defined set of mahogany furni-
ture in a room already furnished
with real furniture but i was by
now sufficiently accustomed to it to
be able to examine it all without that
always-disturbing element of fear-
strangeness i looked at the bedstead
and the roll-back chairs and the
great bureau and a ghostly huge
and quaintly carved wardrobe study-
ing their outlines noting their rela-
tive positions it was on that
occasion that it occurred to me that
it would be of interest to make some
kind of drawing of them i looked
the harder after that fixing the de-
tails and the relations of them all in
my mind and then i went into the
hall and got some paper and a pencil
and set to work

  it was hard work this of repro-
ducing something which i was well
aware was some kind of an appari-
tion especially after looking at the
furniture in the dark bedroom
switching on the light in another
room and then trying to reproduce i

could not of course make a direct
comparison i mean it was impos-
sible to look at my drawing and then
look at the furniture there was
always a necessary interval between
the two processes i persisted
through several evenings and even
for a couple of evenings fell into the
custom of going into my bedroom in
the evenings darkness looking at
what was there and then attempting
to reproduce it after five or six
days i had a fair plan in consider-
able detail of the arrangement of this
strange furniture in my bedroom-
a plan or drawing which would be
recognizable if there were anyqne
now alive who remembered such an
arrangement of such furniture it
will be apparent that a story had
been growing up in my mind or at
least that i had come to some kind of
conviction that what i saw was a
reproduction of something that had
once existed in that same detail and
that precise order

  on the seventh night there came
an interruption

  i had by that time finished my
work pretty well i had drawn the
room as it would have looked with
that furniture in it and had gone
over the whole with india ink very
carefully as a drawing the thing
was finished so far as my indifferent
skill as a draftsman would permit

  that seventh evening i was look-
ing over the appearance of the room
such qualms as the eeriness of the
situation might have otherwise pro-
duced reduced to next-to-nothing
partly by my interest in part by
having become accustomed to it all i
was making this evening as careful
a comparison as possible between my
remembered work on paper and the
detailed appearance of the room by
now the furniture stood out clearly
in a kind of light of its own which i
can roughly compare only to phos-
phorescence it was not quite
that but that will serve lame as it


weird tales

is and trite perhaps to indicate
what i mean i suppose the appear-
ance of the room was something like
what a cat sees when she arches
her back-as algernon blackwood
has pointed out in john silence-
and rubs against the imaginary legs
of some personage entirely invisible
to the man in the armchair who idly
wonders what has taken possession of
his house-pet

  i was as i say studying the detail
i could not find that i had left out
anything salient the detail was too
quite clear now there were no
blurred outlines as there had been on
the first few nights my own mate-
rial furniture had so to speak sunk
back into invisibility which was
sensible enough seeing that i had
put the room in as nearly perfect
darkness as i coiil d and there was no
moon to interfere those nights

  i had run my eyes all around it up
and down the twisted legs of the
great bureau along the carved orna-
mentation of the top of the wardrobe
along the lines of the chairs and had
come back to the bed it was at this
point of my checking-up that i got
what i must describe as the first
shock of the entire experience

  something moved beside the bed

  i peered carefully straining my
eyes to catch what it might be it
had been something bulky a slow-
moving object on the far side of the
bed blurred somewhat just as the
original outlines had been blurred in
the beginning of my weeks experi-
ence the now strong and clear out-
lines of the bed and what i might
describe as its ethereal substance
stood between me and it besides
the vision of the slow-moving mass
was further obscured by a ghostly
mosquito-net which had been one of
the last of the details to come into the
scope of my strange night-vision

  those folds of the mosquito-netting
moved-waved before my eyes

  someone it might almost be im-
agined was getting into that bed

  i sat petrified this was a bit too
much for me i could feel the little
chills run up and down my spine
my scalp prickled i put my hands
on my knees and pressed hard i
drew several deep breaths all-
overish is an old new england ex-
pression once much used by spin-
sters i believe resident in that intel-
lectual section of the united states
whatever the precise connotation of
the term that was the way i felt i
could feel the reactive sensation i
mean of that particular portion of
the whole experience in every part
of my being-body mind and soul
it was-paralyzing i reached up a
hand that was trembling violently-i
could barely control it and the
fingers when they touched the liard-
rubber button felt numb-and
switched on the bedroom light and
spent the next ten minutes recov-
ering

  that night when i came to retire
i dreaded-actually dreaded-what
might come to my vision when i
snapped off the light this however
i managed to reason out with myself
i used several arguments-nothing
had so far occurred to annoy or in-
jure me if this were to be a cumula-
tive experience if something were to
be revealed to me by this deliber-
ate process of slow materialization
which had been progressing for the
last week or so then it might as well
be for some good and useful purpose
i might be in a sense the agent of
providence if it were otherwise if
it were the evil work of some discar-
nate spirit or something of the sort
well every sunday since my child-
hood in church i had recited the
creed and so admitted along with
the clergy and the rest of the con-
gregation that god our father had
created all things-visible and in-
visible if it were this part of his
creation at work for any purpose
the shadows



then he was stronger than they i
said a brief prayer before turning off
that light and put my trust in him
it may appear to some a bit old-
fashioned-even victorian but he
does not ehange along with the cur-
rent fashions of human thought
about him and this human
thought and the modern mind
and all the rest of it does not mean
the vast the overwhelming majority
of people it involves only a few
dozen prideful intellectuals at
best or worst

  i switched off the light and
already clearer i saw what must have
been old morris getting into bed

  i had interviewed old mr bone-
steel the chief government surveyor
a gentleman of parts and much ex-
perience a west indian born on this
island mr bonesteel in response to
my guarded enquiries-for i had of
course already suspected old morris
was not my house still called his-
had stated that he remembered old
morris well in his own remote youth
his description of that personage and
this apparition tallied this un-
doubtedly was old morris that it
was somoone was apparent i felt
somehow rather relieved to realize
that it was he i knew something
about him you see mr bonesteel
had given me a good description and
many anecdotes quite freely and as
though he enjoyed being called on for
information about one of the old-
timers like morris he had been
more reticent guarded in fact when
i pressed him for details of morris
end that there had been some ob-
scurity-intentional or otherwise i
could never ascertain-about the old
man i had already known such
casual enquiries as i had made on
other occasions through natural in-
terest in the person whose name still
clung to my house sixty years or more
since he had lived in it had never got
me anywhere i had only gathered
what mr bonesteels more ample ac-

count corroborated that morris had
been eccentric in some ways amus-
ingly so that he had been extra-
ordinarily wrell-to-do that he gave
occasional large parties which con-
trary to the custom of the hospitable
island of st croix were always re-
quired to come to a conclusion well
before midnight why there was a
story of old morris almost literally
getting rid of a few reluctant guests
by one device or another from these
parties a circumstance on which
hinged several of the amusing anec-
dotes of that eccentric person

  old morris as i knew had not
always lived on st croix his
youth had been spent in martinique
in the then smaller and less impor-
tant town of fort-de-france that
of course was many years before the
terrific calamity of the destruction of
st pierre had taken place by the
eruption of mt pelee old morris
coming to st croix in young middle-
age-forty-five or thereabouts-had
already been accounted a rich man
he had been engaged in no business
he was not a planter not a store-
keeper had no profession where he
produced his affluence was one of the
local mysteries his age it seemed
was the other

  i suppose mr bonesteel had
said that morris was nearer a
hundred than ninety when he-ah
-died i was a child of about eight
at that time i shall be seventy next
august-month that you see wrould
be about sixty-two years ago about
 or about the time your civil
war was beginning now my father
has told me-he died when i was
nineteen-that old morris looked
exactly the same when he wras a boy
extraordinary the black people

used to say- mr bonesteel fell

silent and his eyes had an old mans
dim far-away look

  the black people have some very
strange beliefs mr bonesteel said
i attempting to prompt him a


weird tales

good many of them i have heard
about myself and they interest me

very much what particular-

  mr bonesteel turned his mild blue
eyes upon me reflectively

  you must drop in at my house
one of these days mr stewart said
he mildly i have some rare old
rum that id be glad to have you
sample sir theres not much of it
on the island these days since uncle
sam turned his prohibition laws loose
on us in 

  thank you very much indeed
mr bonesteel i replied i shall
take the first occasion to do so sir
not that i care especially for old
rum except a spoonful in a cup of
tea or in pudding sauce perhaps
but the pleasure of your company
sir is always an inducement

  mr bonesteel bowed to me gravely
and i returned his bow from where i
sat in his airy office in government
house

  would you object to mentioning
what that belief was sir

  a slightly pained expression re-
placed my old friends look of hos-
pitality

  all that is a lot of foolishness
said he with something like asperity
he looked at me contemplatively

  not that i believe in such things
you must understand still a man
sees a good many things in these
islands in a lifetime you know

well the black people- mr

bonesteel looked apprehensively
about him as though reluctant to
have one of his clerks overhear what
he was about to say and leaned
toward me from his chair lowering
his voice to a whisper

  they said-it was a remark here
and a kind of hint there you must
understand nothing definite-that
morris had interfered down there in
martinique with some of their queer
doings offended the zombi-some-
thing of the kind that morris had
made some kind of conditions-oh it

was very vague and probably all
mixed up-you know whereby he
was to have a long life and all the
money he wanted-something like
that-and afterward  

  well mr stewart you just ask
somebody sometime about morris
death

not another word about old mor-
ris could i extract out of mr
bonesteel

  but of course he had me aroused
i tried despard who lives on the
other end of the island a man edu-
cated at the sorbonne and who
knows it is said everything there is
to know about the island and its
affairs

  it was much the same with mr
despard who is an entirely different
kind of person younger for one
thing than my old friend the gov-
ernment surveyor

  mr despard smiled a kind of wry
smile old morris said he re-
flectively and paused

 might i venture to ask-no
offense my dear sir-why you wish
to rake up such an old matter as old
morris death

  i was a bit nonplussed i confess
mr despard had been perfectly
courteous as he always is but some-
how i had not expected such an in-
tervention on his part

  why said i i should find it
hard to tell you precisely mr des-
pard it is not that i am averse to
being frank in the face of such an
enquiry as yours sir i was not
aware that there was anything im-
portant-serious as your tone im-
plies-about that matter put it
down to mere curiosity if you will
and answer or not as you wish sir

  i was perhaps a little nettled at
this unexpected and as it then
seemed to me finicky obstruction
being placed in my way what could
there be in such a case for this
formal reticence-these verbal safe-
the shadows



guards if it were a jumbee
story there was no importance to it
if otherwise well i might be re-
garded by despard as a person of
reasonable discretion perhaps des-
pard was some relative of old mor-
ris and there was something a bit
off-color about his death that too
might account for mr bonesteels
reticence

  by the way i enquired noting
despards reticence might i ask an-
other question mr despard

  certainly mr stewart

  i do not wish to impress you as
idly or unduly curious but-are you
and mr bonesteel related in any
way   

  no sir we are not related in
any way at all sir  

    thank you mr despard   said i
and bowing to each other after the
fashion set here by the danes we
parted

  i had not learned a thing about
old morris death

invent in to see mrs heidenklang
here if anywhere i should find
out what was intriguing me

  mrs heidenklang is an ancient
creole lady relict of a prosperous
storekeeper who lives surrounded
by a certain state of her own
propped up in bed in an environment
of a stupendous quantity of lacy
things and gauzy ruffles i did not
intend to mention old morris to her
but only to get some information
about the zombi if that should be
possible

  i found the old lady surrounded
by her ruffles and lace things in one
of her good days her health has
been precarious for twenty years

  it was not difficult to get her talk-
ing about the zombi

  yes said mrs heidenklang it
is extraordinary how the old beliefs
and the old words cling in their
minds why mr stewart i was
hearing about a trial in the police

court a few days ago one old black
woman had summoned another for
abusive language on the witness
stand the complaining old woman
said she cahl me a wuthless ole
cartagene sir  now think of that
carthage was destroyed way back in
the days of cato the elder you know
mr stewart the greatest town of
all africa to be a carthaginian
meant to be a sea-robber-a pirate
that is a thief one old woman on
this island more than two thousand
years afterward wishes to call an-
other a thief and the word carta-
gene  is the word she naturally uses
i suppose that has persisted on the
west coast and throughout all those
village dialects in africa without a
break all these centuries the
zombi of the french islands yes
mr stewart there are some ex-
traordinary beliefs why perhaps
youve heard mention made of old
morris mr stewart he used to
live in your house you know

  i held my breath here was a
possible trove i nodded my head i
did not dare to speak

  well old morris you see lived
most of his earlier days in marti-
nique and it is said he had a some-
what adventurous life there mr
stewart just what he did or how he
got himself involved seems never to
have been made clear but-in some
way mr stewart the black people
believe morris got himself involved
with a very powerful jumbee and
that is where what i said about the
persistence of ancient beliefs comes
in look on that table there among
those photographs mr stewart
there thats the place i wish i were
able to get up and assist you these
maids everything askew i have no
doubu do you observe a kind of
fish-headed thing about as big as the
palm of your hand yes that is
it

  i found the fish-headed thing
and carried it over to mrs heiden-


weird tales

klang she took it in her hand and
looked at it it lacked a nose but
otherwise it was intact a strange
uneouth-looking little godling made
of anciently-polished volcanic stone
with huge protruding eyes small
humanlike ears and what must have
been a nose like a tortola jackfish or
a black witch-bird with its parrot
beak

  now that continued mrs
heidenklang   is one of the very
ancient household gods of the abo-
rigines of martinique and you will
observe the likeness in the idea to the
lares and penates of your school-
latin days whether this is a lar or
a penate i can not tell and the old
lady paused to smile at her little
joke but at any rate he is a repre-
sentation of something very powerful
-a fish-god of the caribs theres
something egyptian about the idea
too ive always suspected and mr
stewart a carib or an arawak
indian-there were both in these
islands you know-looked much like
an ancient egyptian perhaps half
like your zuni or aztec indians and
half egyptian would be a fair state-
ment of his appearance these fish-
gods had mens bodies you see pre-
cisely like the hawk-headed and jack-
al-headed deities of ancient egypt

  it was one of those the black
people say with which mr morris
got himself mixed up-gahd knows
as they say-how and mr
stewart they say his death was
terrible the particulars ive never
heard but my father knew and he
was sick for several days after seeing
mr morris  body extraordinary
isnt it and when are you coming
this way again mr stewart do
drop in and call on an old lady

  i felt that i was progressing

the next time i saw mr bonesteel
which was that very evening i
stopped him on the street and asked
for a word with him

  what was the date or the ap-
proximate date mr bonesteel of mr
morris death could you recall
that sir

  mr bonesteel paused and consid-
ered

  it was just before christmas
said he   i remember it not so much
by christmas as by the races which
always take place the day after
christmas morris had entered his
sorrel mare santurce and as he left
no heirs there was no one who
owned santurce and she had to be
withdrawn from the races it
affected the betting very materially
and a good many persons were an-
noyed about it but there wasnt any-
thing that could be done

  i thanked mr bonesteel and not
without reason for his answer had
fitted into something that had been
growing in my mind christmas was
only eight days off this drama of
the furniture and old morris getting
into bed i had thought and not un-
naturally it seems to me might be a
kind of re-enactment of the tragedy
of his death if i had the courage to
watch night after night i might be
relieved of the necessity of asking
any questions i might witness what-
ever had occurred in some weird re-
production engineered god knows
how

  for three nights now i had seen
the phenomenon of old morris
getting into bed repeated and each
time it was clearer i had sketched
him into my drawing a short squat
figure rather stooped and fat but
possessed of a strange gorillalike
energy his movements as he
walked toward the bed seized the
edge of the mosquito-netting and
climbed in were somehow full of
power which was the more apparent
since these were ordinary motions
one could not help imagining that
old morris would have been a tough
customer to tackle for all his alleged
age
the shadows



  this evening at the hour when
this phenomenon was accustomed to
enact itself that is about  oclock
i watched again the scene was
very much clearer and i observed
something i had not noticed before
old morris simulacrum paused
just before seizing the edge of
the netting raised its eyes and be-
gan with its right hand a motion
precisely like one who is about to
sign himself with the cross the
motion was abruptly arrested how-
ever only the first of the four
touches on the body being made

  i saw too something of the expres-
sion of the face that night for the
first time at the moment of making
the arrested sign it was one of de-
spairing horror immediately after-
ward as this motion appeared to be
abandoned for the abrupt clutching
of the lower edge of the mosquito-net
it changed into a look of ferocious
stubbornness of almost savage self-
confidence i lost the facial expres-
sion as the appearance sank down
upon the bed and pulled the ghostly
bedclothes over itself

  three nights later when all this
had become as greatly intensified as
had the clearing-up process that had
affected the furniture i observed an-
other motion or what might be taken
for the faint foreshadowing of an-
other motion this was not on the
part of old morris it made itself
apparent as lightly and elusively as
the swift flight of a moth across the
reflection of a lamp over near the
bedroom door the doors in my house
are more than ten feet high in four-
teen-foot-high walls a mere flicker
of something-something entering
the room i looked and peered at
that comer straining my eyes but
nothing could i see save what i might
describe as an intensification of the
black shadow in that corner near the
door vaguely formed like a slim
human figure though grossly out of
all human proportion the vague
w t-

  shadow looked purple against the
black it was about ten feet high
and otherwise as though cast by an
incredibly tall thin human being

  i made nothing of it then and
again despite all this cumulative ex-
perience with the strange shadows of
my bedroom attributed this last
phenomenon to my eyes it was too
vague to be at that time accounted
otherwise than as a mere subjective
effect

  but the night following i watched
for it at the proper moment in the
sequence of old morris movements
as he got into bed and this time it
was distinctly clearer the shadow
it was of some monstrous shape ten
feet tall long angular of vaguely
human appearance though even in
its merely shadowed form somehow
cruelly strangely inhuman i ean not
describe the cold horror of its realiza-
tion the head-part was relatively
to the proportions of the body short
and broad like a pumpkin head of a
man made of sticks by boys to
frighten passers-by on halloween

  the next evening i was out again
to an entertainment at the residence
of one of my hospitable friends and
arrived home after midnight there
stood the ghostly furniture there on
the bed was the form of the apparent-
ly sleeping old morris and there in
the comer stood the shadow little
changed from last nights appear-
ance

  the next night would be pretty
close to the date of old morris death
it would be that night or the next at
latest according to mr bonesteels
statement the next day i could not
avoid the sensation of something im-
pending 

  i entered my room and turned off
the light a little before  seated my-
self and waited

  the furniture tonight was to my
vision absolutely indistinguishable
from reality this statement may
sound somewhat strange for it will


weird tales

  be remembered that i was sitting in
the dark approximating terms
again i may say however that the
furniture was visible in a light of its
own a kind of phosphorescence
which apparently emanated from it
certainly there was no natural source
of light perhaps i may express the
matter thus that light and darkness
were reversed in the case of this
ghostly bed bureau wardrobe and
chairs when actual light was turned
on they disappeared in darkness
which of course is the absence of
physical light they emerged that
is the nearest i can get to it at any
rate tonight the furniture was en-
tirely perfectly visible to me

old morris came in at the usual
time i could see him with a
clarity exactly comparable to what 
have said about the furniture he
made his slight pause his arrested
motion of the right hand and then as
usual cast from him according to
his expression the desire for that
protective gesture and reached a
hard-looking gnarled fist out to take
hold of the mosquito-netting

  as he did so a fearful thing
leaped upon him a thing out of the
corner by the high doorway-the
dreadful purplish shadow-thing i
had not been looking in that direc-
tion and while i had not forgotten
this newest of the strange items in
this fantasmagoria which had been
repeating itself before my eyes for
many nights i was wholly unpre-
pared for its sudden appearance and
malignant activity

 i have said the shadow was
purplish against black now that it
had taken form as the furniture and
old morris himself had taken form i
observed that this purplish colora-
tion was actual it was a glistening
humanlike almost metallic-appearing
thing certainly ten feet high com-
pletely covered with great iridescent
fish-scales each perhaps four square

  inches in area which shimmered as it
leaped across the room i saw it for
only a matter of a second or two i
saw it clutch surely and with a
deadly malignity the hunched body
of old morris from behind just you
will remember as the old man was
about to climb into his bed the
dreadful thing turned him about
as a wasp turns a fly in great
flail-like glistening arms and never
to the day of my death do i ever ex-
pect to be free of the look on old
morris face-a look of a lost soul
who knows that there is no hope for
him in this world or the next-as the
great squat rounded head a head
precisely like that of mrs heiden-
klangs little fish-jumbee descended
revealing to my horrified sight one
glimpse of a huge scythelike parrot-
beak which it used with a nodding
motion of the ugly head to plunge
into its writhing victims breast with
a tearing motion like the barracoota
when it attacks and tears   

  i	fainted then for that was the
last of the fearful picture which i
can remember

  i	awakened a little after  oclock
in a dark and empty room peopled
by no ghosts and with my own more
commonplace mahogany furniture
thinly outlined in the faint light of
the new moon which was shining
cleanly in a starry sky the fresh
night-wind stirred the netting of my
bed i rose shakily and went and
leaned out of the window and lit and
puffed rapidly at a cigarette which
perhaps did something to settle my
jangling nerves

  the next morning with a feeling
of loathing which has gradually
worn itself out in the course of the
months which have now elapsed since
my dreadful experience i took up
my drawing again and added as well
as i could the fearful scene i had
witnessed the completed picture
was a horror crude as is my work in
this direction i wanted to destroy
the shadows



it but i did not and i laid it away
under some unused clothing in one of
the large drawers of my bedroom
wardrobe

three days later just after christ-
mas i observed mr despards
car driving through the streets the
driver being alone i stopped the
boy and asked him where mr des-
pard was at the moment the driver
told me mr despard was having
breakfast-the west indian midday
meal-with mr bonesteel at that
gentlemans house on the princes
cross street i thanked him and
went home i took out the drawing
folded it and placed it in the inside
breast pocket of my coat and started
for bonesteels house

  i arrived fifteen minutes or so be-
fore the breakfast hour and was
pleasantly received by my old friend
and his guest mr bonesteel pressed
me to join them at breakfast but i
declined

  mr bonesteel brought in a swizzel
compounded of his very old rum and
after partaking of this in ceremo-
nious fashion i engaged the attention
of both gentlemen

  gentlemen said i i trust
that you will not regard me as too
much of a bore but i have i believe
a legitimate reason for asking you if
you will tell me the manner in which
the gentleman known as old morris
who once occupied my house met his
death

  i stopped there and immediately
discovered that i had thrown my
kind old host into a state of em-
barrassed confusion glancing at mr
despard i saw at once that if i had
not actually offended him i had by
my question at least put him on his
dignity he was looking at me
severely rather and i confess that
for a moment i felt a bit like a
schoolboy mr bonesteel caught
something of this atmosphere and
looked helplessly at despard both

men shifted uneasily in their chairs
each waited for the other to speak

  despard at last cleared his throat

  you will excuse me mr stew-
art said he slowly but you have
asked a question which for certain
reasons no one aware of the cir-
cumstances would desire to answer
the reasons are briefly that mr
morris in certain respects was-
what shall i say not to do the matter
an injustice-well perhaps i might
say he was abnormal i do not mean
that he was crazy he was though
eccentric his end was such that
stating it would open up a consider-
able argument one which agitated
this island for a long time after he
was found dead by a kind of gen-
eral consent that matter is taboo on
the island that will explain to you
why no one wishes to answer your
question i am free to say that mr
bonesteel here in considerable dis-
tress told me that you had asked it
of him you also asked me about it
not long ago i can add only that
the manner of mr morris end was
such that- mr despard hesi-
tated and looked down a frown on
his brow at his shoe which he tapped
nervously on the tiled floor of the
gallery where we were seated

  old morris mr stewart he re-
sumed after a moments reflection in
which i imagined he was carefully
choosing his words was to put it
plainly murdered there was much
discussion over the identity of the
murderer but the most of it the un-
pleasant part of the discussion was
rather whether he was killed by
human agency or not perhaps you
will see now sir the difficulty of the
matter to admit that he was mur-
dered by an ordinary murderer is to
my mind an impossibility to assert
that some other agency something
ab-human killed him opens up the
question of ones belief ones cre-
dulity magic and occult agencies
are as you are aware strongly in-


weird tales

trenched in the minds of the ignorant
people of these islands none of us
cares to admit a similar belief does
that satisfy you mr stewart and
will you let the matter rest there
sir

  i drew out the picture and with-
out unfolding it laid it across my
knees j nodded to mr despard
and turning to our host asked

  as a child mr bonesteel were
you familiar with the arrangement of
mr morris bedroom

  yes sir replied mr bonesteel
and added everybody was per-
sons who had never been in the old

mans house crowded in when-

i intercepted a kind of warning look
passing from despard to the speaker
mr bonesteel  looking much em-
barrassed looked at me in that help-
less fashion i have already men-
tioned and remarked that it was hot
weather these days

  then said i perhaps you will
recognize its arrangement and even
some of the details of its furnishing  
and i unfolded the picture and
handed it to mr bonesteel

  if i had anticipated its effect upon
the old man i would have been more
discreet but i confess i was nettled
by their attitude by handing it to
mr bonesteel i could not give it to
both of them at once i did the nat-
ural thing for he was our host the
old man looked at what i had handed
him and this is the only way i can
describe what happened became
suddenly as though petrified his
eyes bulged out of his head his lower
jaw dropped and hung open the
paper slipped from his nerveless
grasp and fluttered and zigzagged to
the floor landing at despards feet
despard stooped and picked it up
ostensibly to restore it to me but in
doing so he glanced at it and had
his reaction he leaped frantically to
his feet and positively goggled at the

picture then at me oh i was hav-
ing my little revenge for their reti-
cence right enough

 my god shouted despard
my god mr stewart where did
you get such a thing

  mr bonesteel drew in a deep
breath the first it seemed for sixty
seconds and added his word

  oh my god muttered the old
man shakily mr stewart mr
stewart what is it what is it

where-

  it is a martinique fish-zombi
what is known to professional occult
investigators like elliott odonnell
and william hope hodgson as an
elemental i explained calmly
it is a representation of how poor
mr morris actually met his death
until now as i understand it a
purely conjectural matter chris-
tiansted is built on the ruins of
french bassin you will remember
i added  it is a very likely spot for
an elemental

  but but almost shouted mr
despard mr stewart where did

you get this its-

  i made it said i quietly fold-
ing up the picture and placing it back
in my inside pocket

 but how- this from both

despard and bonesteel speaking in
unison

  i saw it happen you see i re-
plied taking my hat bowing formal-
ly to both gentlemen and murmuring
my regret at not being able to remain
for breakfast i departed

  and as i reached the bottom of
mr bonesteels gallery steps and
turned along the street in the direc-
tion of old morris house where i
live i could hear their voices speak-
ing together

 but how how- this was

bonesteel

 why why- and that was

despard
      roject vision by radio
r  exactly  said the profes-
jl sor quietly or rather not
exactly although it does amount to
the same thing let us say i can
direct your vision by radio and in-
tensify its force

    do you mean to say there is such
a thing as a force of vision i
smiled professor noone had always
been noted even back in college days
for his rabid refusal to accept some
of the established laws of physics

  certainly there is a force of
vision it makes me tired the way
people will accept some old alche-
mists theories regarding everyday
phenomena and call them laws
these people-some of the so-called
best minds of the country too-never
question these snap-judgment laws

but follow the old paths of science
like so many blatting sheep

  an apple hit old man newton on
the head and he jumped up and
strung off his drivel about the laws
of gravitation it must have been
the delirious babbling resulting from
the blow yet because his theory
sounded reasonable people ever since
have worshiped it why i tell
you-

  i was amused but i hated to have
him get started now on one of his
hours-long impromptu lectures not
for nothing had the faculty of yale-
ton discharged him i had thought
at the time along with most of the
students that the old fellow had been
done an injustice in the thirty
years since whenever i had thought
of him i had idealized the professor

                                    


weird tales

as a martyr but here was the real-
ity crazy without a doubt

  to halt the tide of erudite non-
sense that i felt sure was coming i
broke in but my time is limited
professor why did you ask me
here of course your laboratory is
bound to interest me as a writer and

i-

  gravitation is a force coming not
from some mysterious source in the
center of the earth but from the ob-
ject or substance in question itself
newton-

  i must meet a fellow at half-past
 when i ran across you on the
street tonight i was pleased to find
an old friend and was interested in
your description of this laboratory i
was glad to come see it but as for
this idiotic talk of-

  newtons apple attracted the
earth not the earth the apple if
the apple had been bigger and the
earth smaller the earth would have
come up to meet the apple in fact
im not sure but thats what hap-
pened the earth may have carried
newton up to the apple while the
tree went on up beyond it of course
newton didnt know he was getting
a free ride but thats the point we
dont know anything in science and
we mustnt take anyone elses say-
so

  well i rose stiffly i will bid
you good evening

  hm-m no that wouldnt do
the earth would be twitching con-
stantly in all directions going up to
meet apples everywhere as fast as
they ripen it might try to meet an
apple in canton china and one in
canton maine at the same time and
burst in the effort however i am
convinced-i have proved-that
newtons apple attracted the earth
apple earth earth apple-which
gives us earth-apple earth-
apple or  terpomo  is the way they
say potato in esperanto and

speaking of potatoes i can demon-
strate that- sit down

  i fell into my chair blasted into it
by the explosive force of noones yell
i confess i was badly frightened a
raving maniac

  now then the professor spoke
with a cold steely directness if
you dont care for my idiotic talk
kindly refrain from questioning my
statements as for your friend you
will not meet him at half past  oh
dont look so frightened-im not
crazy and nothing is farther from
my thoughts than harm to you you
will not want to leave here tonight
thats all

  i have one more thing to say on
gravitation this evening i propose
to demonstrate something else but
another time i shall prove to you that
the phenomenon of gravitation is due
to a force generated within a given
substance and reaching out toward
the earth in the form of rays and
furthermore i shall bend those rays
for you can you imagine the result
of bent rays of gravitation

  i was appalled gravitation draw-
ing in a curved line or even around
an angle it seemed plausible
enough-as plausible as newtons
theory   but it was absurd of

course still-

  what about the radio vision pro-
jector professor

  now you sound interested you
will be more interested before morn-
ing come into my-astronomical
observatory  



although the room into which we
passed was lined with charts of
the heavens it held none of the other
aspects of the orthodox observatory
where was the domed ceiling
where the circular walls the raised
platforms the slot in the roof this
was an ordinary little square room
with the perfectly common type of
other earths



ceiling the thing most obviously-
lacking i missed last the telescope

  ah yes noone smiled genially
the telescope here you are he
motioned toward the center of the
room

  still i was mystified all the room
contained as far as i could see was
the group of furnishings in the mid-
dle of the soft drugget there were
a few armchairs arranged around an
oak library table a well-stocked
smoking-stand and an innocuous-ap-
pearing radio cabinet it looked to
me like only a place for a gentleman
to smoke and toy with the ether but
there were the charts fast enough
and that cabinet might mean some-
thing

  be seated mr phillips have a
cigar or something we will-toy
with the ether for the second
time profefesor noone handled my
mental phrase coolly delving into the
cabinet the while

  here are our head-sets ah you
place yours over your ears that
looks sensible enough but let me put
it over your eyes so dont be
alarmed i shall don mine in the
same way presently

  the man was crazy then

 we will now tune in thus
and now i have my eye-phones so to
speak adjusted now whos crazy

  not noone surely or if he was
so was i for before my eyes was
spread out a vast bright galaxy ex-
actly as if i lay sprawled on my back
star-gazing so complete was the il-
lusion that i fancied i felt a draft of
cool night air on my forehead

  while you are picking out a star
to visit noone was saying mildly
let me expound another idiotic
theory some old duck or other-no
matter who it was for he was wrong
of course-told us that vision consists
roughly of light rays caught on a
highly sensitive screen within the
eye if there is no light we are told
there is no vision the rays that

reach the eye have first to squirt out
from some such source as the sun or
an electric bulb r what not strike
the object to be seen and bounce off
into the eye-so the books say

  i say that vision like gravitation
originates within the object the eyo
manufactures and gives off a ray of
its own think of the evil eye
which is positively known to emit a
shaft baneful though it is light
simply plays the part of a stimulant
to the ray-making mechanism-a sort
of catalytic agent the more light
the more rays and the more powerful
they are and the farther we can
see

  the eye rays i have learned are
mainly exceedingly high-frequency
electrical rays my little apparatiis
catches these and adds to them the
beams from an intense cold light gen-
erated within the cabinet the re-
sulting rays when put through a
special kind of transformer are con-
verted into powerful radio waves
which are projected into spaee by a
series of ordinary directional an-
tennas so great is their power that
they travel at a speed many thousand
times greater than that of light and
distances measured in light-years
become only a matter of minutes

  the directional antennae i con-
trol with certain knobs on the panel
the intensity or range of the vision
ray is governed by the intensity of
the light added which i control with
a single knob the range is infinite

  how do you like my telescope
would you like to look closer at one
of those planets what about that
pretty red one on the left

  i heard noones fingernails rasp-
ing against the radio panel evi-
dently he was turning on his cold
light for as i stared-upward i must
perforce call it-the stars grew
nearer and brighter the red star
moved toward the left side of the
picture and disappeared


weird tales

  the antennae will fix that said
noone i heard a momentary sound
as of static and the star swung into
view again there our objective is
centered properly lets move up on
it

  so far one could see as much
through the regulation type of tele-
scope i began to suspect trickery of
some obscure sort but my suspicions
were short-lived a network of
canals spread out before my eyes and
every minute became nearer and
plainer canals they were unmis-
takably

  the professor began to speak but
in a voice so incredibly tender as to
suggest a woman crooning over her
baby

 mars he murmured ever
the subject of conjecture and con-
troversy and you and i are per-
mitted to learn the answers to the
questions of centuries

  nearer grew the canals and nearer
what had been only scratches across
them developed rapidly into sets of
parallel lines and then bridges-giant
suspension bridges the like of which
earth engineers have never con-
ceived i grew giddy in my excite-
ment as antlike creatures crawling
along them changed and grew until
i could see them for what they were

  men mars is inhabited



npime i knew nothing of time i
i was rapt enchanted eight-
thirty came and went and might
have come a dozen times for all i
knew i was conscious only of the
quick hushed breathing of the man
beside me on earth and the teeming
life and cataclysmic sights of that
world above us

  mars-with its queer people so
miraculously like the familiar con-
ception of wells its gigantic struc-
tures titanic feats of a civilization
far far beyond ours-we explored at

will so transported were we that it
was perhaps an hour before either
spoke

  we had come to rest directly over
as it were a monster building with
even more than the usual number of
queer antenna wires overhead

  i have been here many times-
it was noone scarcely breaking the
silence-and learned many things
shall we look in the windows my
antennae will direct our vision any-
where

  we seemed to float downward to
halt beside a great single-paned
window perhaps two hundred feet
from the ground

  the middle story noone whis-
pered and the most interesting
now

  for a moment i had the sensation
of touring slowly and smoothly in
midair as though suspended spider-
wise by a thread next i was look-
ing through the crystal-clear foot-
thick plate-glass

  how can i with faculties poor
even by earth standards hope to
describe the myriad activities of the
insect-men within in the short
space i could bear to look i saw
miracle heaped on miracle in the most
matter-of-fact kind of way dross
into gold easy for these people i
saw it done in the twinkling of an
eye that was the least of their
stolid marvels it was all too steep
for me and to call back my reeling
senses i shut my eyes

  dont the professor fairly
screamed it you made me miss
the most important part-the very

crux-of an experiment that-

but pardon me of course you didnt
understand when you want to shut
your eyes again let me know just
to teach you watch what happens
when i shut mine

  i had to smile in spite of my cha-
grin i understood quickly enough
why noone had been annoyed at me
at his shout i had of course popped
other earths



my eyes open i had fixed them
absently on a martian workman in-
haling-literally-his lunch i was
just in the act of wondering how the
food smelled when the scene was
wiped out

  in a flash what had been a vista of
whirring machinery and hurrying
little men became a great luminous
ball covered over with a network of
lines

  you see mr phillips you are
half-way between earth and mars
the reason of course is that by clos-
ing my eyes i cut off half the optic
force of course i can remedy the
situation by increasing the cold light
but its much easier for me to-open
my eyes again

  the workman rose and stretched
and all seemed well on mars

  likewise-the scene changed
again as the professor went on-i
can close one eye and leave you three-
quarters of the way between here and
there if i shut both eyes and you
shut one you will be one-quarter of
the way along as you can doubtless
understand by now professor
noone laughed his good humor re-
stored

  lets look over some of the other
planets he suggested amiably we
can return to mars later if we wish
lets see now

  he shut off the light entirely and
immediately came my original sensa-
tion of lying on my back gazing at
the stars the red planet was in the
middle of the heavens now the
scientist went on

  look them over and pick out an-
other star venus over there
going up

  hold on professor honestly
this is-it seems somehow-indecent
to hang over another world-or over
this world either i suppose it is pos-
sible-looking down on its creatures
peeking in their windows seems too-
godlike im afraid-

  phillips do you believe in god
such a question fired at me at such
a time had an indescribably terrify-
ing effect and i tore off that blas-
phemous head-set as i glared at the
man noone had followed suit and
we sat eye to eye

  certainly dont you
absolutely yes indeed my dear
phillips how else can i account for
the wonders i have seen there
must be some great purpose behind it
all but as for the god of the ortho-
dox bible-if you have faith in such
a one hold tight to it i propose to
show you things now that will shake
that faith shall i go on

  shake my faith in the bible no
man could do that-let this one try
if he wished yet my voice held far
from the stoutness i meant it to hold
as i answered him

  go ahead



t have to follow a blazed-or
a blazing-trail to get to my pres-
ent objective i have named the
planet ago the inhabitants call
it-but you will learn

  i wondered why all the mystery
once more i tried to bulwark my
courage against fear of the unknown
but the journey in itself was fear-
some enough

  we were bound optically speaking
far beyond the realm of the wildest
astronomers nightmare just as a
starter the professor had tuned us in
on neptune

  neptune is the farthermost away
from earth of all the known
planets noone muttered i have
been amused to learn that the astron-
omers during  made the discov-
ery that the known universe is at
least a million light years across
with my little radio telescope these
learned gentlemen would find their
known universe increasing somewhat
why see here-


weird tales

  we had been standing figuratively
on the surface of neptune all the
while he was speaking noone had
been swinging our vision ray back-
ward and forward sweeping it slow-
ly across the new fearsome sky
with his last words he had brought
the ray to bear steadily on a certain
tree-shaped constellation and was
now bringing that constellation rap-
idly nearer only dimly visible at
first the tree was flashing at us at
such a pace that i instinctively re-
coiled in a matter of seconds the
tree had leaped upon us and we had
passed through it i breathed again
i had the sensation of having miracu-
lously survived a blow from a burn-
ing christmas tree

  in the center of our field of vision
among a host of queerly colored
bodies there hung one star of a hard
brilliant white our pace slowed

  well phillips the professor
chuckled their known universe is
far behind us we traveled along at
a leisurely gait until we got to nep-
tune but you must know we ticked
off quite a distance the astronomers
admit that neptune is nearly three
billion miles from our sun the
jump to neptune however was a
mere bagatelle our quick second
jump-the leap through the trees-
was something like one million times
as long now as for this nice white
star ahead so many million light-
years away from earth what do you
suppose it is

  ago i hazarded brightly

 no just the second of some
seventy blazes on our trail to ago
stunned i subsided

  i should like to make all my
jumps as quickly as the last one
said noone but unfortunately i
cant always have such a fine starry
hoop to jump through and guide my
jump we shall have to go slowly
and cautiously at times now watch
the white star

  i watched while this body never

dreamed of by ordinary astronomers
grew it became a pea a marble an
orange and so on until it lost all
spherical shape and became a sheet of
beaten silver filling our field of vision
still it drew nearer the silver be-
came lined scarred and discolored in
spots presently it was the surface
of a world-a bleak evilly forbidding
world

  again noone manipulated his an-
tennae until we got a view of a new
sky again he located a star far be-
yond and brought it close

  it took me a year to find this
short path to ago it has been three
years since i first stumbled onto the
planet and lost her and it was a year
before i found her again

  professor noone talked on for
some time describing his method of
plotting out the course some day
he hoped to have a system of mi-
crometrically divided dials on his an-
tennae controls so that he could make
a memorandum of the exactly correct
direction of any desired star

  the talk was interesting but it had
been a long time now since we had
pushed off from earth and the strain
was beginning to tell on me how
many trillions of light-years away
could this ago be i wondered again
why noone had chosen such a name
and what the agonians called their
planet how for that matter did
noone know what they called it
how could he know their language or
read their writings if he did know
the name why not tell it to me 

  ah the professors pleased
little exclamation aroused me now
we are in agos solar system and
presently that pale bluish planet
its ago watch it

  here was an end to the suspense
then i was glad to fix my attention
on the planet and wratch it go through
the same metamorphoses as had those
others but as the surface came near
enough for us to make out the con-
tour of the continents i observed that
other earths



which ended the suspense indeed
now the world was so close i could
easily pick out the mountains lakes
and forests i spoke to my compan-
ion with a trace of pique

     this is an anticlimax i must say
professor didnt you rather go
astray in your calculations

  thats only the first of a number
of questions you will be asking direct-
ly   he said imperturbably   i cant
possibly answer them all so i shall
refrain from answering any you
will see

isaw all right i saw that profes-
sor noone am phd and lord
knows what-all with all his attain-
ments was positively crazy this
planet to which i had been led with
such a blare of trumpets was-
mother earth

   ago eh well i know what
the inhabitants call it they call it
earth

  the inhabitants call it earth
parroted noone

  oh well this was novel at least
let the show go on i watched the
familiar outline of north america
spread out and pass from the sides
of the field the mississippi flowed
through the center of the picture for
a moment and then moved over and
away to the left the well-known
colored patchwork of states was odd-
ly but naturally missing and so were
the printed names but here was
something i could recognize at once-
the capitol at albany down the

hudson we sped and here was-

  new york i shouted

  new york came noones echo
see here professor of course i
see the joke now you wanted me to
see ourselves as others see us but
why the name ago and what has
this to do with shaken faith

  no answer

  down to earth we sank to land in
the very street in which professor
noones house stood but-

  what is wrong with this pic-
ture my tone was light enough
biit the lightness cloaked a conscious-
ness of something faintly eery

  the scientist deigned to say
ah

  something was wrong what was
it up the street we moved and in
the direction of the house in which
we sat at a corner i scanned a sign
there it was nason street

  nason street was correct but
something was wrong the sign
now it looked queer the lettering
looked unfamiliar even funny as
we passed on i noticed the roadway
where was the paving come to
think of it the light back at the
corner had been dim-an oil lamp
where were the usual automobiles
what about this quaint conveyance
approaching as i lived a horse
and buggy

  here at last was no  noones
house but how queerly different
the doorway was flanked with oil
lamps as i stared the door opened
and out came professor noone him-
self with a roll-rimmed derby bal-
anced on his head and sporting a
beautifully waxed black mustache

  proff no one of yaleton i
gasped to the life

  none other said noone

 what does it all mean

what-

  the man rested a hand on my arm
lets drop over to yaleton he
suggested calmly perhaps there
you will find light

  once more we were over the house-
tops and once more as we sailed along
i marveled at the familiar yet unac-
countably amiss aspect of my stamp-
ing ground of years dim and dark
the streets gave an impression of
being uninhabited deserted yet
lights there were here and there and
even the light of an occasional
vehicle but those lights that moved
were so dim and they moved so
slowly


weird tales

  these were not the thickly inter-
mingling hurrying bright shafts of
automobile headlamps i thought
again of the ancient horseanbuggy
of nason street

  yaleton swung into view below us
and my heart leaped and stopped
yaleton certainly but not the
bustling little college community i
had visited only last week this was
the yaleton of student days thirty-
odd years gone

  the professor seemed to be making
some sort of calculation lets see
 minus -hm-m this is
april th well well and to
me he said phillips this is a coin-
cidence watch the little play im
sure is about due

  by now i had lost the power of
coherent thinking almost of wonder-
ing our ship of vision settled to
earth directly in front of carmel
hall in which i remembered were
the college executive offices a lamp
sputtered on a post by the open door-
way but the vestibule was dark i
was trying to wonder at the changed
appearance of the place when a wide
inner door swung open to reveal a
number of men sitting around a table
i started from my chair shocked out
of my mental paralysis

  professor hitchcock-the man
with the beard hes been dead for
years 

  noone shook his head sadly dear
old walter hitchcock the best
president this college has ever had i
missed you at the funeral phillips i
thought that of all the students you

would-

  he wanted to expel me and to
write my father i had forgotten
the absurdity of it all and was ac-
tually defending myself

  ah yes i know we shall see
do you recognize any of the other
gentlemen present

  of course i did there were pro-
fessor higgins professor smith and
the rest i even recognized the jan-

itor of my dormitory although i had
forgotten his name

  proff no one is late as usual
remarked my companion he will
be here presently you remember we
just saw him leave his house of
course we beat him here he is still
on the train no doubt the other
faculty gentlemen are getting im-
patient-as usual noone chuckled
delightedly

  it must have been a hot night at
yaleton though it was cool enough
here the janitor arose and opened
the door still wider the president
lifted his long beard and ran a large
handkerchief around under his collar
even in my bewilderment i had to
smile at what this operation revealed
as i had always suspected professor
hitchcock wore no necktie

  but wake up phillips all this
can not be-should not be this
ancient graybeard is dead

  the old president gave me the lie
he arose from his chair glared
around from one to another of his
companions with his beard jerking
up and down in rapid angry speech
and banged his fist down upon the
table-all most unseemly actions for
a cadaver evidently his anger was
increased by the absence of professor
noone

  like an actor in a play the latter
individual now made his entrance
hitchcock strode over to him before
noone had time to hang up his low-
comedy derby grasped him by the
shoulder and shook a closely written
paper under his nose

 is this- i wet my lips

they were parched from hanging
apart so long is this where you-
where they-

  i didnt get fired this night this
concerns-another you will see
directly there-look now

  merciful heavens i looked-i
looked at horace h phillips i saw
myself go up the steps and pass into
that room of the past
other earths



  again i was forced to laugh in the
midst of my horrified stupefaction
so this funny-looking youth was
horace m phillips of yaleton uni-
versity this gangling lad with the
tight-legged bell-bottomed trousers
of yellow and the tight blue cutaway
coat yes sadly it was i

  come now professor tell me
what this means the scene is famil-
iar enough professor hitchcock
after what he considered the worst of
my college-boy pranks resolved to ex-
pel me and write my father why he
called me here to tell me and to show

me the letter and-

  and in the morning-he told you
he had decided to destroy the letter
and give you another chance eh
yes but-

  if you will stay the rest of this
act you will get some light on that
too

  i gave up for the nonce the effort
to learn what all this delving into
the past could mean and tried to
concentrate on the scene before me
i stood by while young phillips got
the dressing-down of my life as he
left the room i saw the younger pro-
fessor noone step up to the president
and begin what appeared to be an
impassioned plea now he would
throw a gesture in the direction of the
letter lying on the table and now he
would seem to appeal to the other
men in the room once he leveled an
accusing finger at the janitor at
which the fellow quailed

  finally after many negative
shakes of the great beard professor
hitchcock threw up his hands in elo-
quent despair and nodded at once
the meeting was dissolved

  learn something phillips the
scientist asked slyly almost bash-
fully oh well no matter now
as for that prank of yours i always
suspected- lets peek in a win-
dow or two  

  the scene changed until i found
myself on a level with the second

story window of a dormitory- in the
room was a young man sitting de-
jectedly before a table under a lamp
we paused only long enough to see
the youth-mr phillips again-place
an arm on the table edge and bow his
head onto it before we dropped to a
lighted window in the next story

 deak jehnsons room-and
theres deak i whispered

  i had never cared for this fellow

i remembered nor he for me ri-
valry in athletics had something to do
with it i had thought as did also a
certain  flapper of the town
still i had never before suspected
that deaks rancor ran so deep as
this

  as i pressed my disembodied eyes
to that doubtless long-since-shattered
window-pane i saw the janitor enter
the room deak rose asked a ques-
tion or two nodded in a satisfied
manner and handed the man a green-
back as soon as he was alone deak
sat down and began to write

  the plot thickens chuckled
noone we must read that letter
here we are

  just as in a movie close-up the
letter lay before our eyes deaks
hand and pen traveled rapidly across 
it tracing the words that damned
him forever in my eyes

  dear pa my scheme worked perfectly
and phillips has been given his walking
papers the janitor was just in to inform
me his fake testimony had done the trick
thought you would be interested be-
cause-

  because of course deaks father
was interested in anything however
mean that would result in a victory
for his son over that of old joe
phillips i could see the whole mis-
erable business now and i knew
whom to thank for my deliverance
from what had threatened to be a
disgraceful mess

  but that could come later for the
immediate present all i wanted was
some explanation of the phenomenon
i was witnessing


weird tales

  shut it off professor there
was real determination in my tone
now i want you to answer my
questions 

  without a word noone did as di-
rected and we removed our head-sets

 what we have seen i com-
menced is authentic to be sure it
is impossible that it can be happening
again before our eyes that scene
was enacted thirty years ago

   ago-thats the word



cire away professor i spoke
  - along my cigar

  phillips i presume you know the
popular theory as to how this earth
originated

  i nodded

  for once the popular theory is
correct eons ago a lump of some
kind of matter was thrown off by our
sun that lump after passing
through ineffable convulsions and
slow metamorphoses has become what
we call earth

  but do you realize that every
single thing-every brick every man
every word even-of this earth was
done up in that ball of matter oh
i dont mean it was present in the
form of a brick a man or what not
but it was surely there in its com-
ponent parts-its elements if not
from that original ball whence did
the things of today come

  nothing ever happens there are
no accidents there is a physical
cause for everything every whim of
a mans mind healthy or otherwise
can be traced to some tiny blood-ves-
sel nerve-end or spore of the physical
brain and those spores in their turn
had a logical physical origin you
say events which changed the worlds
history hinged on a whim  but
those events had an immutable cause
because the whim did perhaps the
father of the whim had eaten some-
thing for dinner that caused an ab-

normal-or prevented a normal-
flow of blood to the brain the ab-
normal brain fostered a different
thought or whim than it would have
done had the person concerned eaten
something else for dinner his din-
ner menu in turn depended on some
other equally physical cause

  the same logic applies to events
which hinge on so-called chance
and miracles a man is out in a
rowboat say being blown toward the
rocks by a tremendous wind when
he is within a rod of the rocks the
wind suddenly veers and blows him
in the other direction a miracle
says he or providence or luck
depending on whether the man is of a
religious turn of mind

    pish tush that sudden change
of wind had perfectly natural causes
and had been brewing for days per-
haps furthermore if the man and
his boat had not been present the
veering of the wind would have taken
place just the same a minutes fear-
less cogitation should convince the
most unyielding fundamentalist that
what i say is true that nothing ever
just happens and that everything
has a physical cause

  now phillips with all that in
mind consider what conditions would
be obtaining here at this moment if
the sun had delayed a minute in
throwing off that lump of matter
exactly the same condition would
obtain except that we would be one
minute behind where we are now
instead of being  p m the time
now would be  but you and i
would be sitting here and you would
be phillips and i would be noone
dont you agree

   i did

    if the sun had delayed a hundred
years in throwing off our lump of
course the world would be a century
behind the times but it would have
been the same old world-the lump
would have contained its same old
potential events you and i would
other earths

  



not be here phillips but our fore-
fathers would and they would be
doing the same things now that they
actually did do one hundred years
ago thats logic isnt it

  this earth with all its complica-
tion of different substances really
contains only a comparatively few
elements out of those few elements
all the material things that have ever
been were made that of course is
an old thought but perhaps a new
thought is that all the abstract things
came from those same material ele-
ments think it over

  the old man paused while i strove
to marshal my frayed reasoning
powers for a rout of this necessarily
nonsensical theory but strive as i
might i could not find a vulnerable
spot in it it could not be of course
and yet- i remained silent

  suppose phillips that even as
our sun once threw off a little pack-
age of elements another sun gave
birth to an identical package im-
possible  hold on

  i have convinced you that noth-
ing ever happens in this world
should not the same rule apply to the
great assembly of worlds the uni-
verse whatever caused our sun to
spew us forth may well have caused
some other sun to do the same thing
there are millions upon millions of
solar systems-a fact i had never
thoroughly appreciated until i per-
fected my sight projector among
so many millions of suns why is it
improbable that another world-an-
other not very complicated package
of elements exactly like this one-
could be born we should wonder
rather how large a number of such
worlds there are how many earths

  in the short time at my disposal
i have already found several one of
them i have shown to you the
events of that earth are identical
with those of ours why because
its embryo contained the same ele-
ments in the same proportions but

it was not born at the same time
the calendars and clocks there show
the period to be just twenty-nine
years ten months twenty-one days
and twenty-two hours behind ours
roughly present-day events of that
world are events of this world thirty
years ago

  ago the planet i had just visited
impossible it was the absurd dream
of a madman but with my own eyes
i had seen the proof i had seen a
world i knew was earth and knew
was not earth of today

  a slice from my past relived be-
fore my eyes i could easily guess
what that other horace m phillips
was doing now that night if i re-
membered rightly i had sat with
bowed head until long after the lamp
had burned out then crawled miser-
ably into bed what a prophet phil-
lips of ago would call me could i but
tell him what had taken place in my
life since that night

  suddenly came a new thought
most radical of all



t havent dared thats all the

  t professor was saying but
since you will voyage with me i will
undertake it he turned to his cold
light control

  what a blast of light was at work
in that cabinet i shuddered as i
thought for the hundredth time of
what would happen should that
ordnance of rays become turned back-
ward upon us there would be one
black flash and then blindness
death more likely i thought as i
considered the piercing power of the
shaft one thing sure there would
be no charred eye-sockets from this
heatless light

  once more i marveled at the wis-
dom of the man beside me he had
learned much from the martians had
he well he was not so very igno-
rant to begin with it took a fairly




weird tales

smart man to get an entrance certifi-
cate to mars university

 it was on mars that i learned
the principle of cold light the pro-
fessor put in   before that time my
mercury vapor light was a con-
stant-

  did the martians give you a
post-graduate course also in mind-
reading i shifted uncomfortably

  noone laughed i learned that
simple trick at facultus college
facultus is the name i gave to a
particularly offensive little star i
stumbled upon one day it is in-
habited solely by poly-legged crawl-
ing beings whose only means of com-
munication is through their waving
antennae

  just for an hours amusement i
studied the creatures i noticed that
the centipedish fellow sending out
thoughts had both his antennae tense
and quivering while the one receiv-
ing allowed himself to slump relaxed
all over his eyes assuming that
stupid expression peculiar to college
faculty members in a mental con-
versation first one creature would
stiffen and then the other this led
me to wonder if thoughts were only
another manifestation of high fre-
quency waves or rays i believed the
inhabitants of that far-off world
knew how to exercise some set of
functions that put their minds into
a receptive state for the thought rays
probably relaxing all the muscles of
body and brain as it were allowed
this faculty to gain ascendency

  to shorten a long story my
theory proved out imperfectly to
be sure-as yet i wear no antennae-
i have developed a thought-receiving
or mind-reading faculty for myself
that faculty is present in you in all
of us some few on earth know how
to use it

  where was my scoffing i could
not scoff my mind was worn out-i
was tired i remember a subdued
chuckle from noone the sound of a

more rapid turning of knobs and i
slept

  it seemed only a minute before
the professors voice insinuated it-
self into my consciousness

  easy now he was murmuring
you are awake but let your eyes
open slowly loose the force of your
vision gradually thats it slow-
ly i heard the whir of controls
presently there you understand
i had to reduce the light force in
proportion to your waxing eye force
nowr what do you see

  ago i grunted

  still sleepy eh look closely

  i batted my eyes-with far-reach-
ing results-and looked again there
was the mississippi as it had ap-
peared before and the great lakes
evidently the professor had again
chosen to approach the wrorld on our
home side we drew nearer

  well

  still i could see nothing to dis-
tinguish this sun-batlied world from
our earth or ago it was one or the
other surely but no those scin-
tillating spots

  hundreds of them wherever i
looked i could see them below us
lay a country speckled over with a
starry rash a new united states

  aha new you bet its new
never in history has our country
borne such markings they are the
proof that this is our goal we are
now at the point where i have always
turned back in terror once more
shall we go on it rests with you

  i dared not think go on i
said huskily



at first wre judged the earth
under our eyes to be at least a
hundred years older than ours

  it was when we were as before
tracing a course above the hudson
and coming to earth as we pro-
gressed downstream that we got our
other earths



first close-up of the mysterious
spangles we had observed shining
from near the surface they turned
out to be great metallic spheres of a
golden color covered with countless
square facets from which the sunlight
flashed constantly the great spheres
were mounted on individual steel
towers of varying heights coming
on a number of the things in a group
high above a vast tobacco field we
paused to study them

  as we speculated as to their use
each ball in unison with all the
others in the group began to sur-
round itself with a bluish lambent
aura the auras increased in size
and density until the central golden
cores shone through but dimly the
bluish haze-clouds became shot
through at increasingly shorter in-
tervals with forked zigzagging
tongues of flame for all the world
like miniature lightning shafts each
moment the flames leaped farther and
farther from out their auras accom-
panied by a volley of crackling

  presently the little flickers began
to meet one another in their darting
courses across the field at each in-
tersecting point a little ball of mist
was formed until perhaps a score of
them were being wafted about be-
tween the towers soon all had
joined into a blanket of black cloud

  rain-making gasped noone

  he was right below through oc-
casional rifts in the cloud we could
see the tobacco plants being drenched
in a copious shower while the fields
on all sides remained bathed in clean
sunshine

  another scientists dream come
true i said weather control
then is possible

  certainly and another theory
of mine is vindicated these people
are using an idea i have had for
years this is merely a demonstra-
tion of static electricity doing useful
work those huge balls are nothing
but electrodes of giant leyden-jars

at the operators will some of the
nodes become charged with negative
static electricity and others positive
you saw for yourself what happened
when the charges overflowed the
capacity of the electrodes

 a home-made thunder shower
eh

  thats it meanwhile the nodes
in the  other fields are grounded to
keep any tiny accumulations of
static drained from the premises
and doubtless they radiate a mild
warmth to break up any stray hatful
of rain-causing vapor

  useful static i thought of how i
had cursed the static only last eve-
ning when it had ruined a perfectly
nice batch of broadcast from kipt
for me

 home radio audiences never
think of static here noone said
confidently the weather control
people collect it all for their own
use

  the shower below us was abating
the de-energized balls reflecting the
sunlight and gleaming even brighter
than before we moved off

  what next i breathed

  i can not hope to list here all the
marvels unfolded for us in the next
hour or two many of them failed
utterly to register with me such
things as pneumatic tubes for under-
ground passenger traffic aerial travel
made safe sane and commonplace
economic improvements shown by the
total lack of evidences both of pov-
erty and of great wealth-these
things perhaps lie within the scope of
my descriptive powers but my
mind is not that of a scientist pro-
fessor noone however seemed to
comprehend the most stupendous of
the prodigies even anticipate them

  why one might wonder did the
scientist keep us so long in downtown
new york why not hasten to
nason street to see how our familiar
neighborhood would look after a
hundred years i did not wonder

for i too feared for all my brave
words to face anything touching on
our personal future i too was con-
tent to procrastinate

central park was changed but
little we had just noted this
fact when ur attention was attract-
ed by a man-in costume exactly like
that of the man of today-sitting on
a bench reading a newspaper

  heres where we answer the date
question said the professor lower-
ing our eyes to the mans shoulder
level ah would you believe it
the paper was dated july  
only about ten years ahead then
and as for my personal future here
it was spread on the paper before me

noted author home from china trip

horace m phillips deplores

passing of old orient

  the piece stated among other
things that a feature of the passage
was mr phillips winning of the pool
on the ships run for both days

  i was amused elated-and relieved
immeasurably it was certain that i
had nothing to worry about in the
next ten years at least

  noone congratulated me heartily
enough but even in the warmth of
his tone i could detect an undercur-
rent of chill of dread this i pre-
tended not to notice

  well well ill bet theres some-
thing in that paper about the great
professor noone also probably the
world before us-shall we name it
ahead or hence or what-owes
most of its scientific wonders to that
gentleman ill bet all hence has
been watching you ever since you
announced the invention of the eye-
sight shooter

  the old man was silent i con-
tinued apparently undaunted to
come back to this earth for the
moment do you intend to make pub-
lic your discoveries at once or will
you set yourself up for a while as a

prophet and soothsayer in general
you could certainly get by either as
a cold scientist or an ardent occult-
ist

  i could not babble on forever in
the face of noones persistent dull
silence but evidently my blather had
an effect i found myself approach-
ing nason street at once

  how different was the street now
from that of today and that of ago
in place of lumbering buggies and
carefully regulated automobiles the
roadway was filled with little indi-
vidual electric eycles darting at
breath-taking speed even these
however were regulated for a strip
of grass-ground along the center of
the street kept the two currents of
traffic separated heavy vehicular
traffic was completely absent

  bulky commodities are no longer
in demand i judge said noone at
least in residential districts coal
for one thing is probably long out of
date there must be heavy loads in
local traffic in some sections-where
building is going on for instance
ah here is no 

  instantly the professors pall of
glumness settled down although i
could see no reason for it as yet the
old house looked about the same as it
does now surely there was nothing
about it to suggest anything so very
dreadful

  the first evidence of something
wrong we found to be the professors
laboratory-the room adjoining that
in which we were sitting we had
peered through the window to look
upon a scene of utter desolation
the dust of years lay thick over
everything marring the scientists
most precious possessions

  only one thing could keep me
away from this room the old
mans voice was filled more with re-
gret than sadness i dared not ask
what that one thing was

  as we stared appalled a playful
mouse knocked down what we quickly
other earths



identified as noones notebook it lay-
open upon the floor freed of dust by
its fall and easily legible the left-
hand page was half filled with the
professors cramped writing the
notes which were utterly meaning-
less ceased in the middle of a long
technical word the entry thus
abruptly broken off was dated dec
  two years from now

  why had i assented to taking this
damnable trip to a world not meant
for our eyes

  lets-lets turn back i whis-
pered groping toward my compan-
ion

    too late   noone strove to make
his tone stronger less unhappy
but this laboratory-i-i cant
bear-i dont care to look at it

  downstairs we found a family of
youngish people just arising from
luncheon afternoon here then an
aged servant entered the room asked
a question and was answered by a
nod

  my nephews family noone
muttered the old fellow is john
staples who let you in this evening
more friend than servant too now
ill bet-good old john lets see
where he goes

  staples had evidently gotten the
afternoon off for presently we saw
him emerge from the back door clad
in street clothes and carrying a long-

ish pasteboard box and signal one of
the little hovering taxi-planes we
had no difficulty in keeping the
machine it our field of vision and fol-
lowing it across the city and out over
the rolling hills of westchester
here the plane dipped and swung out
of sight beyond a massiveset of stone
buildings

  i could hear the trembling of
noones hand at the controls i
knew he must be reading the name
on the great central building as we
passed over it why would he not
turn back

  the plane we found parked in a
field a little to the rear of the build-
ings the driver sat at the wheel
alone while staples wended a way
across the field unwrapping his
package as he went we followed
him along a path and through the
opening in a hedge beyond staples
had stopped and knelt beside-

  with a curse i ripped at those
cursed eyepieces professor noone
unhurriedly removed his and-
smiled he had seen

  a grave behind a madhouse such
was the fate of that other professor
noone on that other earth and he
knew as i knew that nothing could
alter the course of destiny and that
the same fate was to be his on this
earth yet he smiled a brave man
is professor noone-old proff no

 harlow the werewolf

the belief that certain human
beings were changed or
changed themselves at times
into lower animals has prevailed since
ancient days not only in europe but
in many other parts of the world
the animal into which persons were
most often transformed was a wolf
in ancient greece a man named lyca-
on was said to have been turned into
a wolf as a result of eating human
flesh the greeks also said that a
man of the anteus family was chosen
by lot at certain intervals taken to
a lake in arcadia where he hung his
clothes on an ash-tree and swam
across there he became a wolf and
wandered with the pack nine years
herodotus said that the neurii a
tribe of eastern europe were turned
into wolves for a few days every year

  hideous stories were told of witches
and wizards who were able to turn
themselves into wolves and thus went
forth to work the will of their master
the devil on innocent persons the
change was brought about in various
ways in europe the commonest
method was to remove the clothing
and put on an enchanted girdle
usually of the skin of the animal
whose form was to be assumed
sometimes the body was rubbed with
a magic salve our old southern
friend uncle remus declares that
such people have a slit in the skin at
the back of the neck where they can
take hold of the skin and pull it off
like a shirt-undoubtedly an african
form of the myth less skilful per-
sons brought about the change by

    

drinking water out of the animals
footprint by eating of its brains or
drinking of certain enchanted
streams

  in prussia livonia and lithuania
in the sixteenth century the chris-
tian bishops said that the werewolves
were more destructive than the nat-
ural wolves they were a sort of
army allied against christian people
and divine law during that cen-
tury many peasants influenced by
the mania imagined themselves
wolves there was clear proof of
many cases in which human beings
especially children had been killed
and eaten by men who fancied them-
selves wolves

  it seems that werewolves were not
always opposed to mankind and the
church for in the year  a d a
pack of them went to a monastery
and killed some heretic monks
saints sometimes had the power of
turning people into- wolves st pat-
rick changed vereticus king of
wales into a wolf and st natalis
cursed a prominent irish family by
dooming each member of it to be a
wolf for seven years an involuntary
werewolf could be cured by kneeling
in one place for a hundred years or
you could bring either a voluntary or
involuntary werewolf back to human
form by accusing it with being a
werewolf or saluting it with the sign
of the cross addressing it by its hu-
man baptismal name three times
striking it on the forehead three
times with a knife or drawing three
drops of its blood
a grim race with death

the gray rider

by charles hilan craig

his name was lear he was
the worlds greatest racing
driver and it was said of
him that he was utterly devoid of
nerves

  for three years he had been the
leader among the speed demons of
the surfaced tracks and during those
three years he had won every race
in which his car had finished several
times accidents had sent him to the
pits to stay-again he had been
rammed by a driver who lost control
-but whenever he finished the race
it was in the lead

 throughout the land he was
known to the sporting public as
king lear-to his more intimate
friends simply as the king

  he no longer needed the money
which came to him through racing
but rather drove for the sheer zest
of driving there was a thrill for
him in every turn on any speedway
a double thrill every time he came
thundering into the straightaway
as he raced he laughed and he was
a man who still could laugh when he
had finished the last lap on the great
brick oval at the capital of the rac-
ing world-laugh while ready hands
unbent the fingers that clutched the
wheel in a deathlike grip

  without nerves was king lear
they said and there was little reason
to deny that bald statement for he
was a man who went out in front and
stayed there till the race was over or
something had broken no tremen-
dous spurts no sneaking no jockey-
ing lear clamped down the accelera-

tor and held it there little wonder
he got a thrill from those terrible
turns for he went into them faster
than any other living man-and
lived less strange the double thrill
from the straightaway for his car
was a weaving phantom when he
came from the turns a gray mist
when he went into the next

  lear was perhaps thirty-five years
old at the time of which i write and
had been racing for about ten years
it was nearing the end of the racing
season and he was in the next to the
last race of the year when he first saw
the man whom he intuitively dubbed
the gray rider he had paid
little attention to the other entries
it made no difference to him who
they were or in what numbers-he
would beat them all barring accident

  he was on the sixtieth lap of the
two hundred and fifty mile grind
when first his attention was attracted
by this gray rider who was to be his
chief competitor in the next race

  the car was gray not the gray
which bright enamel usually gives
but a drab gray a sordid gray the
car was low-slung and apparently
awkwardly built king lear found
himself criticizing as he swung past
that car on the sixtieth lap the man
was deep down in the seat barely
showing his head but he also was
gray and he seemed to be laughing
as lear swept past him an uncom-
fortable thought welled up in the
mind of the king that there was a
sardonic something about this man
and his car that he could not fathom

                                  


weird tales

but he swept the thought away and
settled down to finish ahead

  they were on the ninetieth lap
when the gray car almost rammed
him and he swung into the fence
splintering it and ripping off a
wheel

  with anger in his heart he made
ready to protest but the gray rider
had swept from the track and was
waiting for him having left the
race im sorry he said

  lears anger dissipated like a mist
he laughed

  maybe it wasnt your fault he
said and took mental stock of the
other driver

  gray dust had settled finely over
the drivers face the hair just
visible under the turned-up helmet
was gray under the gray of that
face there were many tiny wrinkles
the face was set as though it had
come from a mold-granite hours
of grim intensity at the taped wheel
had seen to that

  whats your name asked lear
he was surprized that he never had
seen this man before-perhaps some
new chap breaking into the game

  gray answered the gray rider
and to lear it appeared that for a
moment a sardonic smile touched the
thin lips he didnt like that smile

  there was something   

  he had intended to look the man
up to ask angus about him
but somehow he didnt do it a rea-
son why he should now want to find
out who and what a fellow racer was
didnt occur to him-he who had
never given a hang what was put
against him in a race

  angus his team manager had
come a-running

  what happened he had said
and lear had replied i almost got
rammed  

  what and there had been on
the face of angus a strange expres-
sion of wonder and doubt lear had

looked about for gray but the man
had gone

speed-more speed that was what
was killing lear cars were not
built fast enough for him time
after time in races he had ruined
cars driving them to the ultimate
limit of their endurance till they
were burned out beneath him
wrecked many times-but he seemed
to have the lives of a cat he always
came through his god was speed

  itll get you yet said angus
again and again you cant keep
up those stunts and live take it
from me boy if you dont quiet down
on the curves youll go through the
big gates some day this from
angus who was continuously ex-
horting his other drivers to show a
little pep

  lear laughed

  but then that was lear that was
why he was the best-loved driver in
america the crowd came to see
speed and he was there to show it to
them but deep down in his heart
he knew that angus wras right too
near-many times-was death for
now that the great american classic
race had been run at an average rate
of more than one hundred miles per
hour the ultimate speed on wheels
was fast being attained little more
could be expected of a machine which
clung to earth

  yet lear still asked for speed

  to see him drive in a race was to
see something never to be forgotten
he always smiled as he rode of
course the crowd couldnt see that
but they knew for the press agents
had long been busy all the crowd
could see was a blur as the red ear
swept past the stands but they
knew he was smiling at death as he
rode and from east and west men
came to watch him ride like a red
whirlwind to victory

  and then the last five hundred mile
race of the season-on the new board
the gray rider



track in california the team man-
aged by angus was entered and of
course lear was expected to win

  as the day for the race neared
there came into the mind of lear a
question would the gray rider be
in the race  why he wondered about
this he did not know he never had
questioned before he did not ask
angus about it for he knew that a
query now about the other entries
would serve to make the fiery little
scotchman wonder if he were losing
his iron nerve he didnt read the
newspapers he didnt read the bulle-
tins  he never read anything all he
cared to do was race-all he ever de-
sired was to sit under the wheel of his
little red cannon and thunder to
victory he never had cared who it
was he was racing

  speed-more speed he would 
shatter that five hundred mile record
to fragments he would show them
that his red cannon could show its
heels to any ear ever built  and as
he thought of it in his last trial spin
before the big race he involuntarily
increased his pace till the other cars
the fence the empty stands became
gray blurs paster faster faster
round the curve into the long
straightaway past the stands again
faster faster and then he knew
instinctively as angus flagged him in
that he had ridden at a pace never
before equaled by man

nphe day came the hour was at
hand-the time for the big race
car after car drew up to the pits for
final adjustments car after car was
trundled to the starting line drivers
smoking a last cigarette mechani-
cians pottering about the drone of
a ear ready to go

  the officials lined them up lear
and his red wagon in the first tier
the others stretched to the side and
behind the gray rider

  lear looked about yes there he
was at the outside of the first tier

and lear was puzzled that made an
extra car in the first row-not safe

  an official was beside him

  whats the idea of the extra car
there he asked

  which car asked the official

    gray one-number thirty-one-
outside

  the official looked where he pointed
and laughed said something which
lear did not catch

 but lear laughed too he had
never been accused of lack of sports-
manship what did he care if the
first tier was jammed from pole to
stand he was going to burn them
all up win

  but as he sat there looking at the
gray rider there came over him a
sensation he never had known before
-a scarcely felt impression of im-
pending disaster somehow deep
down within him he felt that this
would be his last race but he shook
off the feeling with a laugh of dis-
dain lighted a cigarette and waited

  there sounded the last preliminary
signal the track was cleared a
sputtering roar and they were off
round the track-a droning string
of angry motors following the pacer
a vast thunder of sound they
passed the starting line and the flag
dropped down and up again

 a dull roar from the crowd
screaming of exhausts whining
throb of motors gray film of smoke
gray cloud of dust speed-more
speed

  mile after mile lap after lap-and
the gray rider had nosed up and was
running close to lear a gray shad-
ow stalking him urging him on and
he responded his car changed from
a red streak to a misty blur as he
thundered around the track a hun-
dred and ten - twenty -jhirty -
forty speed and the gray shadow
still stalked him lacking the neces-
sary spurt to go around

  a car went through the fence on
the death curve another went over


weird tales

and over when a tire blew out but by
superb skill lear and the gray rider
missed the wreckage went on and on
speed-speed to the utmost

  into the pit for new tires and gas
then back to the grind back to the
race with the gray shadow which was
challenging his superior skill

  they passed the hundred and
eightieth lap hie hundred and
ninetieth ten laps to go and on
the straightaway the gray rider
passed lear the smile left lears
face his teeth set hard his dark
face was a mass of tiny wrinkles he
leaned forward

  but his car did not respond he
held grimly at the rear wheel of the
gray car but could do no better
wildly reckless on the curves a rag-
ing demon in the stretch-it availed
nothing the gray rider was just
as reckless just as superb in his
handling of the gray car

  five laps to go-three laps-two
laps-one lap and the spring on his
foot-fced broke he could feel it go
wide open his car thundered on he
reached over to shut off the power
but at that moment the gray riders
eyes looked into his he could feel
rather than see the sardonic challenge
in those eyes he gripped again the
wheel careened wildly into the curve

  how he made it he did not know
but he came out a mere touch
would send him tumbling into the
fence

  at the rear wheel of the gray car
he wanted speed and couldnt get it
speed down the stretch he roared
like the wind and then he began to
gain gain gain his radiator was
even with the drivers seat of the
leading ear a little more a little
more he did not hear the roar of
the race had no ears for the thunder
of the hundred thousand people mad
with the thrill of speed he could
think of nothing but the sardonic
smile which he felt must be on the
face of the gray rider

  slowly he gained but too late too
late the checkered flag went down
-but the gray rider had drawn it

  a low snarl escaped lears lips as
he realized that he had lost then
the snarl changed to an exclamation
of horror as the gray rider shot in
front of him he started to slow up
forgetting that his foot-feed was no
longer working sharply he twisted
the wheel went broadside into the
gray rider he heard a tremendous
roaring the clang of steel on steel
smelt the odor of blazing gasoline
felt its wrath sear his lungs saw
stars shoot across his vision saw
too-no felt-the sardonic smile of
the man who had beaten him  

lear regained consciousness for
only a few minutes at the hos-
pital angus was there with him
firmly solicitous

  lost gasped lear

  lost hell said angus you
won

  but the gray car-thirty-one-
beat me out just before i crashed into
him

  angus looked puzzled

  there wasnt any thirty-one in
the race he said and you didnt
crash anybody you hit the fence
but the gray rider

  there wasnt any gray rider
but-there must have been
lear knew that angus was lying
no gray rider the fool why
look there was the gray rider be-
side angus now his hand on angus
shoulder the gray rider-gray
with dust gray with sternness a
sardonic smile was upon his face but
the gray eyes which shone through
the goggles held no mirth they
were cold-as death

  hes beside you cried lear
hoarsely look angus

  angus turned all around in utter
amazement there was no one there

 why lear-

  lear was dead

the thousand-and-second tale
of scheherazade

by edgar allan poe

  truth is stranger than fiction

-old baying

haying had occasion lately
in the course of some oriental
investigations to consult the
tellmenow isitsdomot a work which
like the zohar of simeon jochaides
is scarcely known at all even in
europe and which has never been
quoted to my knowledge by any
american-if we except perhaps the
author of the curiosities of american
literature-having had occasion i
say to turn over some pages of the
first-mentioned very remarkable work
i was not a little astonished to dis-
cover that the literary world has
hitherto been strangely in error re-
specting the fate of the viziers
daughter scheherazade as that fate
is depicted in the arabian nights
and that the denouement there given
if not altogether inaccurate as far as
it goes is at least to blame in not
having gone very much farther

  for full information on this inter-
esting topic i must refer the in-
quisitive reader to the isitsdomot
itself but in the meantime i shall be
pardoned for giving a summary of
what i there discovered

  it will be remembered that in the
usual version of the tales a certain
monarch having good cause to be
jealous of his queen not only puts
her to death but makes a vow by his
beard and the prophet to espouse
each night the most beautiful maiden
in his dominions and the next morn-

ing to deliver her up to the execu-
tioner

  having fulfilled this vow for many
years to the letter and with a re-
ligious punctuality and method that
conferred great credit upon him as
a man of devout feeling and excellent
sense he was interrupted one after-
noon no doubt at his prayers by a
visit from his grand vizier to whose
daughter it appears there had oc-
curred an idea

  her name was scheherazade and
her idea was that she would either
redeem the land from the depopu-
lating tax upon its beauty or perish
after the approved fashion of all
heroines in the attempt

  accordingly and although we do
not find it to be leap-year which
makes the sacrifice more meritorious
she deputes her father the grand
vizier to make an offer to the king of
her hand this hand the king eager-
ly accepts-he had intended to take
it at all events and had put off the
matter from day to day only through
fear of the vizier-but in accepting
it now he gives all parties very dis-
tinctly to understand that grand
vizier or no grand vizier he has not
the slightest design of giving up one
iota of his vow or of his privileges
when therefore the fair schehera-
zade insisted upon marrying the king
and did actually marry him despite
her fathers excellent advice not to
do anything of the kind-when she
would and did marry him i say will

                                    


weird tales

i nill i it was with her beautiful
black eyes as thoroughly open as the
nature of the case would allow

  it seems however that this politic
damsel who had been reading
machiavelli beyond doubt had a
very ingenious little plot in her mind
on the night of the wedding she
contrived upon i forget what spe-
cious pretense to have her sister
occupy a couch sufficiently near that
of the royal pair to admit of easy
conversation from bed to bed and
a little before cock-crowing she took
care to awaken the good monarch
her husband who bore her none the
worse will because he intended to
wring her neck on the morrow-
she managed to awaken him i say
although on account of a capital
conscience and an easy digestion he
slept well by the profound interest
of a story about a rat and a black
cat i think which she was narrating
all in an undertone of course to
her sister when the day broke it
so happened that this history was not
altogether finished and that schehe-
razade in the nature of things could
not finish it just then since it was
high time for her to get up and be
bowstrung-a thing very little more
pleasant than hanging only a trifle
more genteel

  the kings curiosity however pre-
vailing i am sorry to say even over
his sound religious principles in-
duced him for this once to postpone
the fulfilment of his vow until next
morning for the purpose and with
the hope of hearing that night how it
fared in the end with the black eat
a black cat i think it was and the
rat

  the night having arrived however
the lady scheherazade not only put
the finishing stroke to the black cat
and the rat the rat was blue but
before she well knew what she was
about found herself deep in the
intricacies of a narration having

reference if i am not altogether mis-
taken to a pink horse with green
wings that went in a violent man-
ner by clockwork and was wound
up with an indigo key with this
history the king was even more pro-
foundly interested than with the
other-and as the day broke before
its conclusion notwithstanding all
the queens endeavors to get through
with it in time for the bowstringing
there was again no resource but to
postpone that ceremony as before for
twenty-four hours the next night
there happened a similar accident
with a similar result and then the
next-and then again the next so
that in the end the good monarch
having been unavoidably deprived of
all opportunity to keep his vow dur-
ing a period of no less than one
thousand and one nights either for-
gets it altogether by the expiration of
this time or gets himself absolved of
it in the regular way or what is
more probable breaks it outright as
well as the head of his father confes-
sor at all events scheherazade
triumphed and the tariff upon
beauty was repealed

  my dear sister said she on the
thousand-and-second night i quote
the language of the isitsdorrwt at this
point verbatim my dear sister
said she now that all this little diffi-
culty about the bowstring has blown
over and that this odious tax is so
happily repealed i feel that i have
been guilty of great indiscretion in
withholding from you and the king
who i am sorry to say snores-a
thing no gentleman would do the
full conclusion of the story of sinbad
the sailor this person went through
numerous other and more interesting
adventures than those which i re-
lated but the truth is i felt sleepy
on the particular night of their nar-
ration and so was seduced into cut-
ting them short-a grievous piece of
misconduct for which i only trust
the thousand and second tale



that allah will forgive me but even
yet it is not too late to remedy my
great neglect-and as soon as i have
given the king a pinch or two in order
to wake him up so far that he may
stop making that horrible noise i will
forthwith entertain you and him if
he pleases with the sequel of this
very remarkable story

  hereupon the sister of schehera-
zade as i have it from the isit-
soornot expressed no very particular
intensity of gratification but the
king having been sufficiently pinched
at length ceased snoring and finally
said hum dnd then hoo
when the queen understanding these
words which are no doubt arabic
to signify that he was all attention
and would do his best not to snore
any more-the queen i say having
arranged these matters to her satis-
faction re-entered thus at once into
the history of sinbad the sailor

  t length in my old age these
are the words of sinbad himself
as retailed by scheherazade-at
length in my old age and after en-
joying many years of tranquillity at
home i became once more possessed
of a desire of visiting foreign coun-
tries  and one day without acquaint-
ing any of my family with my design
i packed up some bundles of such
merchandise as was most precious and
least bulky and engaging a porter
to carry them went with him down to
the sea-shore to await the arrival of
any chance vessel that might convey
me out of the kingdom into some re-
gion which i had not as yet explored

  having deposited the packages
upon the sands we sat down beneath
some trees and looked out into the
ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship
but during several hours we saw none
whatever at length i fancied that i
could hear a singular buzzing or hum-
ming sound-and the porter after
listening awhile declared that he also

could distinguish it presently it
grew louder and then still louder so
that we could have no doubt that the
object which caused it was approach-
ing us at length on the edge of the
horizon we discovered a black speck
which rapidly increased in size until
we made it out to be a vast monster
swimming with a great part of its
body above the surface of the sea it
came toward us with inconceivable
swiftness throwing up huge waves of
foam around its breast and illumi-
nating all that part of the sea through
which it passed with a long line of
fire that extended far off into the dis-
tance

  as the thing drew near we saw it
very distinctly its length was equal
to that of three of the loftiest trees
that grow and it was as wide as the
great hall of audience in your palace

	most sublime and munificent of the
califs its body which was unlike
that of ordinary fishes was as solid as
a rock and of a jetty blackness
throughout all that portion of it
which floated above the water with
the exception of a narrow blood-red
streak that completely begirdled it
the belly which floated beneath the
surface and of which we could get
only a glimpse now and then as the
monster rose and fell with the bil-
lows was entirely covered with metal-
lic scales of a color like that of the
moon in misty weather the back
was flat and nearly white and from it
there extended upwards of six spines
about half the length of the whole
body

  this horrible creature had no
mouth that we could perceive but as
if to make up for this deficiency it
was provided with at least four score
of eyes that protruded from their
sockets like those of the green drag-
on-fly and were arranged all around
the body in two rows one above the
other and parallel to the blood-red
streak which seemed to answer the


weird tales

purpose of an eyebrow two or three
of these dreadful eyes were much
larger than the others and had the
appearance of solid gold

  although this beast approached us
as i have before said with the great-
est rapidity it must have been moved
altogether by necromancy-for it had
neither jins like a fish nor web-feet
like a duck nor wings like the sea-
shell which is blown along in the man-
ner of a vessel nor yet did it writhe
itself forward as do the eels its head
and its tail were shaped precisely
alike only not far from the latter
were two small holes that served for
nostrils and through which the mon-
sted puffed its thick breath with
prodigious violence and with a
shrieking disagreeable noise

  our terror at beholding this hid-
eous thing was very great but it was
even surpassed by our astonishment
when upon getting a nearer look we
perceived upon the creatures back a
vast number of animals about the size
and shape of men and altogether
much resembling them except that
they wore no garments as men do
being supplied by nature no doubt
with an ugly uncomfortable covering
a good deal like cloth but fitting so
tight to the skin as to render the poor
wretches laughably awkward and put
them apparently to severe pain on
the very tips of their heads were cer-
tain square-looking boxes which at
first sight i thought might have been
intended to answer as turbans but i
soon discovered that they were exces-
sively heavy and solid and i there-
fore concluded they were contrivances
designed by their great weight to
keep the heads of the animals steady
and safe upon their shoulders
around the necks of the creatures
were fastened black collars badges
of servitude no doubt such as we
keep on our dogs only much wider
and infinitely stiffer-so that it was
quite impossible for these poor vic-

tims to move their heads in any di-
rection without moving the body at
the same time and thus they were
doomed to perpetual contemplation
of their noses-a view puggish and
snubby in a wonderful if not posi-
tively in an awful degree

 when the monster had nearly
reached the shore where we stood it
suddenly pushed out one of its eyes
to a great extent and emitted from it
a terrible flash of fire accompanied
by a dense cloud of smoke and a
noise that i can compare to nothing
but thunder as the smoke cleared
away we saw one of the odd man-
animals standing near the head of the
large beast with a trumpet in his
hand through which putting it to
his mouth he presently addressed us
in loud harsh and disagreeable ac-
cents that perhaps we should have
mistaken for language had they not
come altogether through the nose

  being thus evidently spoken to
i was at a loss how to reply as i could
in no manner understand what was
said and in this difficulty i turned to
the porter who was near swooning
through affright and demanded of
him his opinion as to what species of
monster it was what it wanted and
what kind of creatures those were that
so swarmed upon its back to this the
porter replied as well as he could for
trepidation that he had once before
heard of this sea-beast that it was a
cruel demon with bowels of sulfur
and blood of fire created by evil genii
as the means of inflicting misery upon
mankind that the things upon its
back were vermin such as sometimes
infest cats and dogs only a little
larger and more savage and that
these vermin had their uses however
evil-for through the torture they
caused the beast by their nibblings
and stingings it was goaded into that
degree of wrath which was requisite
to make it roar and commit ill and so
fulfil the vengeful and malicious de-
signs of the wicked genii
the thousand and second tale



  this account determined me to
take to my heels and without notice
even looking behind me i ran at full
speed up into the hills while the por-
ter ran equally fast although nearly
in an opposite direction so that by
these means he finally made his es-
cape with my bundles of which i have
no doubt he took excellent care-al-
though this is a point i can not deter-
mine as i do not remember that i
ever beheld him again

  for myself i was so hotly pur-
sued by a swarm of the men-vermin
who had come to the shore in boats
that i was very soon overtaken
bound hand and foot and conveyed
to the beast which immediately swam
out again into the middle of the sea

  i now bitterly repented my folly
in quitting a comfortable home to
peril my life in such adventures as
this but regret being useless i made
the best of my condition and exerted
myself to secure the good-will of the
man-animal that owned the trumpet
and who appeared to exercise author-
ity over his fellows i succeeded so
well in this endeavor that in a few
days the creature bestowed upon me
various tokens of his favor and in the
end even went to the trouble of teach-
ing me the rudiments of what it was
vain enough to denominate its lan-
guage so that at length i was en-
abled to converse with it readily and
came to make it comprehend the ar-
dent desire i had of seeing the world

  it is in fact very surprizing my
dear queen that you omitted hither-
to these later adventures of sinbad
do you know i think them exceed-
ingly entertaining and strange
the king having thus expressed
himself we are told the fair schehe-
razade resumed her history in the fol-
lowing words

 sinbad went on in this manner
with his narrative-i thanked the
man-animal for its kindness and soon
found myself very much at home on
the beast which swam at a prodigious
rate through the ocean although the
surface of the latter is in that part of
the world by no means fiat but
round like a pomegranate so that we
went-so to say-either up hill or
down hill all the time   

  that i think was very singular
interrupted the king

  nevertheless it is quite true re-
plied scheherazade

  i have my doubts rejoined the
king but pray be so good as to go
on with the story

  i will said the queen  the
beast continued sinbad swam as i
have related up hill and down hill
until at length we arrived at an
island many hundreds of miles in cir-
cumference but which nevertheless
had been built in the middle of the
sea by a colony of little things like
caterpillars

   leaving this island said sinbad
-for scheherazade it must be un-
derstood took no notice of her hus-
bands ill-mannered ejaculation-
leaving this island we came to an-
other where the forests were of solid
stone and so hard that they shivered
to pieces the finest-tempered axes
with which we endeavored to cut
them down l

    hum   said the king again but
scheherazade paying him no atten-
tion continued in the language of
sinbad

  passing beyond this last island
we reached a country where there was
a cave that ran to the distance of
thirty or forty miles within the bow-
els of the earth and that contained a
greater number of far more spacious
and more magnificent palaces than
are to be found in all damascus and
bagdad from the roofs of these
palaces there hung myriads of gems
like diamonds but larger than men
and in among the streets of towers
and pyramids and temples there
flowed immense rivers as black as
ebony and swarming with fish that
had no eyes

  hum said the king

  we then swam into a region of the
sea where we found a lofty mountain
down whose sides there streamed tor-
rents of melted metal some of which
were twelve miles wide and sixty
miles long  while from an abyss
on the summit issued so vast a quan-
tity of ashes that the sun was entirely
blotted out from the heavens and it
became darker than the darkest mid-
night so that when we were even at
the distance of a hundred and fifty
miles long  while from an abyss
possible to see the whitest object

however close we held it to our
eyes

  hum said the king

  after quitting this coast the
beast continued his voyage until we
met with a land in which the nature
of things seemed reversed-for we
here saw a great lake at the bottom
of which more than a hundred feet
beneath the surface of the water
there flourished in full leaf a forest
of tall and luxuriant trees
hoo said the king

  some hundred miles farther on
brought us to a climate where the at-
mosphere was so dense as to sustain
iron or steel just as our own does

    proceeding still in the same direc-
tion we presently arrived at the
most magnificent region in the whole
world through it there meandered
a glorious river for several thousands
of miles this river was of unspeak-
able depth and of a transparency
richer than that of amber it was
from three to six miles in width and
its banks which rose on either side
to twelve hundred feet in perpen-
dicular height were crowned with
ever-blooming trees and perpetual
sweet-scented flowers that made the
whole territory one gorgeous garden
but the name of this luxuriant land
was the kingdom of horror and to
enter it was inevitable death

  we left this kingdom in great
haste and after some days came to
another where we were astonished to
perceive myriads of monstrous ani-
mals with horns resembling scythes
upon their heads these hideous
beasts dig for themselves vast caverns
in the soil of a funnel shape and
line the sides of them with rocks so
disposed one upon the other that they
fall instantly when trodden upon by
other animals thus precipitating
them into the monsters dens where
their blood is immediately sucked
and their carcasses afterwards hurled
contemptuously out to an immense
distance from the caverns of death

    pooh   said the king

  continuing our progress we per-
ceived a district with vegetables that
grew not upon any soil but in the
air there wer others that sprang
from the substance of other vege-
tables s others that derived their sub-
stance from the bodies of living ani-
mals and then again there were
others that glowed all over with in-
tense fire and others that moved
from place to place at pleasure and
what was still more wonderful we
discovered flowers that lived and
breathed and moved their limbs at
will and had moreover the detest-
able passion of mankind for enslav-
ing other creatures and confining
them in horrid and solitary prisons

pshaw said the king

  quitting this land we soon ar-
rived at another in which the bees
and the birds are mathematicians of
two very difficult problems they
give daily instruction in the science
of geometry to the wise men of the
empire the king of the place having
offered a reward for the solution of
two very difficult problems they
were solved upon the spot-the one
by the bees and the other by the
birds but the king keeping their solu-
tion a secret it was only after the
most profound researches and labor
and the writing of an infinity of big
books during a long series of years
that the men-mathematicians at
length arrived at the identical solu-
tions which had been given upon the
spot by the bees and by the birds  
oh my said the king

txe had scarcely lost sight of

  	 this empire when we found our-
selves close upon another from whose
shores there flew over our heads a
flock of fowls a mile in breadth and
two hundred and forty miles long
so that although they flew a mile dur-

  	aristolochia clematitis

  	the bees construct their cells with just such
sides in just such number and at just such in-
clinations as it has been demonstrated in a
problem involving the profoundest mathematical
principles are the very sides in the very num-
ber and at the very angles which will afford
the creatures the most room that is compatible
with the greatest stability of structure

  during the latter part of the th century the
question arose among mathematicians-to de-
termine the best form that can be given to the
sails of a windmill accordng to their varying
distances from the revolving vanes and likewise
from the centers of the revolution this is an
excessively complex problem for it is in other
words to find the best possible position at an
infinity of varied distances and at an infinity of
points on the arm there were a thousand futile
attempts to answer the query on the part of the
most illustrious mathematicians and when at
length an undeniable solution was discovered
men found that the wings of a bird had given it
with absolute precision ever since the first bird
had traversed the air


weird tales

ing every minute it required no less
than four hours for the whole flock to
pass over us-in which there were
several millions of millions of fowl
oh fy said the king

  no sooner had we got rid of these
birds which occasioned us great an-
noyance than we were terrified by
the appearance of a fowl of another
kind and infinitely larger than even
the rocs which i met in my former
voyages for it was bigger than the
biggest of the domes on your seraglio

	most munificent of califs this
terrible fowl had no head that we
could perceive but was fashioned en-
tirely of belly which was of a prodig-
ious fatness and roundness of a soft-
looking substance smooth shining
and striped with various colors in its
talons the monster was bearing away
to its eyrie in the heavens a house
from which it had knocked off the
roof and in the interior of which we
distinctly saw human beings who
beyond doubt were in a state of
frightful despair at the horrible fate
which awaited them we shouted
with all our might in the hope of
frightening the bird into letting go
of its prey but it merely gave a snort
or puff as if of rage and then let fall
upon our heads a heavy sack which
proved to be filled with sand  
stuff said the king

  it was just after this adventure
that we encountered a continent of
immense extent and prodigious solid-
ity but which nevertheless was sup-
ported entirely upon the back of a
sky-blue cow that had no fewer than
four hundred horns
that now i believe said the

king because i have read something
of the kind before in a book

  we passed immediately beneath
this continent swimming in between
the legs of the cow and after some
hours found ourselves in a wonderful
country indeed which i was in-
formed by the man-animal was his
own native land inhabited by things
of his own species this elevated the
man-animal very much in my esteem
and in fact i now began to feel
ashamed of the contemptuous famil-
iarity with which i had treated him
for i found that the man-animals in
general were a nation of the most
powerful magicians who lived with
worms in tseir brains which no
doubt served to stimulate them by
their painful writliings and wrig-
glings to the most miraculous efforts
of imagination  

  nonsense said the king

  among the magicians were do-
mesticated several animals of very
singular kinds for example ther
was a huge horse whose bones were
iron and whose blood was boiling
water in place of corn he had black
stones for his usual food and yet in
spite of so hard a diet he was so
strong and swift that he could drag
a load more weighty than the grand-
est temple in this city at a rate sur-
passing that of the flight of most
birds

  twattle said the king

  i saw also among these people a
hen without feathers but bigger than
a camel instead of flesh she had iron
and brick her blood like that of the
horse to whom in fact she was
nearly related was boiling water
and like him she ate nothing but wood
or black stones this hen brought
forth very frequently a hundred
chickens in a day and after birth
they took up their residence for sev-

jurors created a man out of brass and
wood and leather and endowed him
with such ingenuity that he would
have beaten at chess all the race of
mankind with the exception of the
great calif haroun alraschid an-
other of these magi constructed of
like material a creature that put to
shame even the genius of him who
made it for so great were its reason-
ing powers that in a second it per-
formed calculations of so vast an ex-
tent that they would have required
the united labor of fifty thousand
fleshy men for a year but a still
more wonderful conjuror fashioned
for himself a mighty thing that was
neither man nor beast but which had
brains of lead intermixed with a
black matter like pitch and fingers
that it employed with such incredible
speed and dexterity that it would
have had no trouble in writing out
twenty thousand copies of the koran
in an hour and this with so exquisite
a precision that in all the copies there
should not be found one to vary from
another by the breadth of the finest
hair this thing was of prodigious
strength so that it erected or over-
threw the mightiest empires at a
breath but its powers were exercised
equally for evil and for good

 ridiculous said the king

 among this nation of necroman-
cers there was also one who had in
his veins the blood of the salaman-
ders for he made no scruple of sit-
ting down to smoke his chibouc in a
red-hot oven until his dinner was
thoroughly roasted upon its floor
another had the faculty of convert-

without even looking at them during
the process another had such a deli-
cacy of touch that he made a wire so
fine as to bo invisible another had
such quickness of perception that he
counted all the separate motions of
an elastic body while it was spring-
ing backward and forward at the rate
of nine hundred millions of times in
a second
absurd said the king
another of these magicians by
means of a fluid that nobody ever yet
saw could make the corpses of his
friends brandish their arms kick out
their legs fight or even get up and
dance at his will another had culti-
vated his voice to so great an extent
that he could have made himself
heard from one end of the world to
the other another had so long an
arm that he could sit down in damas-
cus and indite a letter at bagdad-or
indeed at any distance whatsoever
another commanded the lightning
to come down to him out of the heav-
ens and it came at his call and
served him for a plaything when it
came another took two loud sounds

manly interruptions on the part of

an unhappy fatality that besets them
and from which not even the miracu-

put it into the heads of these accom-
plished ladies that the thing which we
describe as personal beauty consists
altogether in the protuberance of the
region which lies not very far below

ratio of the extent of this lump hav-

 again and then that dromedary

isitsdomot both grieved and aston-
ished scheherazade but as she knew
the king to be a man of scrupulous
integrity and quite unlikely to for-
feit his word she submitted to her
fate with a good grace she derived
however great consolation during
the tightening of the bowstring from
the reflection that much of the history
remained still untold and that the
petulance of her brute of a husband
had reaped for him a most righteous
reward in depriving him of many
inconceivable adventures

the invading
horde

continued from page 

rushing hordes of the enemy monop-
ters

  but i reckoned without the deep
wisdom of the unknown enemy com-
mander who led the mighty offensive
for i found that even as lona and
i could not get out of this great cone
of light neither could our aerial
messages we were as separated
from the city of the east as if we had
been in the very bowels of the earth
the corps in charge of the invisible
frontier would never get our mes-
sage and before they could see what
was happening it would be too late-
and thus it turned out

  even as the hordes carrying a
wall of dark cloud ahead of them
climbed into the skies high above the
ceiling of our monopters i thought
of another way lona and i were
both perfect physical specimens
perhaps we could endure the terrific
coldness of the atmosphere above the
ordinary ceiling of our monopters-
and win our way to freedom by fly-
ing out at the top of the cone of light

  i shouted to lona who nodded
wearily we lifted straight upward
with all the speed we could get from
our monopters nor did we even
slacken pace until we had attained a
height twenty thousand feet greater
than the accepted ceiling of our
monopters but the cone of light
stretched upward away from us still
seeming to reach the very stars-and
at an elevation of eighty thousand
feet there still seemed no way of
winning free and we could climb no
higher the air would not sustain
the weight of our monopters and
from this grand and awful height we
were compelled to remain and watch
the slaughter of our people

i was afraid of this
new way to learn music

 - until i found it was easy as a-b-c

      ont be silly mary youre
b perfectly foolish to believe you
can learn to play music by that
method you are silly to
even think about it why it
claims to teach music in half
the usual time and ivithout
a teacher its impossible

 that is how my husband
felt when i showed him an
ad telling about a new way
to learn music but how i
hated to give up my new hope
of learning to play the piano

when i heard others playing

i envied them so that it al-
most spoiled the pleasure of the music for
me for they oould entertain their friends
and family    they were musicians i
had to be satisfied with only hearing music

  i was so disappointed i felt very bitter
as i put away the magazine containing the
advertisment for a week i resisted the
temptation to look at it again but finally
i couldnt keep from peeking at it it
fascinated me so much that finally half-
frightened half-enthusiastic i wrote to the
u s school of music-without letting my
husband know

  imagine my joy when the lessons started
and i found that they were as easy as a b
c why a mere child could master them
my progress was wonderfully rapid and be-
fore i realized it i was rendering selections
which pupils who study with private teachers
for years cant play for thru this short-
cut method all the difficult tiresome parts
of music have been eliminated and the play-
ing of melodies has been reduced to a sim-
plicity which anyone can follow with ease

  finally i decided
to play for jack
and show him what
a crazy course had
taught me so one
night when he was
sitting reading i
went casually over
to the piano and
started playing a
lovely song words
cant describe his as-
tonishment why 
 why  he floun-

dered i simply smiled and went on playing but
soon jack insisted that i tell him where i had
learned    when    how so i told of my

secret

  one day not long after my husband came to me
and said mary dont laugh but i want to try
learning to play the violin by that wonderful
method you certainly proved to me that it is a
good way to learn music

  sa only a few months later jack and i were
playing together now our musical evenings are
a marvelous success every one compliments us
and we are flooded with invitations music has
simply meant everything to us it has given us
popularity  fun happiness

enemy monopters fell away from
their myriad numbers when they had
reached the airways above city of the
east and the monopters in plain
sight now lifted skyward toward
our hordes of defenseless people in
and above air lane -and be-
fore the corps in charge of the in-
visible frontier could have seen
what was happening the enemy
monopters were among our monop-
ters so that the rays from the invisi-
ble frontier would now have meant at
the same time the wholesale slaughter
of our own people there was a
chance that our people might win the
fight in the air i thought and knew
that the department heads of the in-
visible frontier must have thought
likewise

  but it was hopeless the enemy
fell by thousands yes but where one
enemy fell fell a hundred of our
people free of their monopters
which had been burned away from
around them by the mysterious rays
used by the enemy the occupants
themselves burned to cinders even be-
fore they fell downward-drifting
moths their wings singed their
bodies lifeless and shapeless soulless
and lost black myriads like
feathers drifting earthward from a
horizon-to-horizon flock of crows
which is set upon by millions upon
millions of fighting sparrows the
black clouds under which the enemy
had launched its attack settled about
the spires of the skyscrapers-and
those spires vanished in a breath dis-
integrated into invisible powder be-
fore our eyes while our searchlights
faded and died their operators i
knew instinctively had died at their
posts of duty one by one

  from our place of imprisonment
inside that cone shut off from all our
precious world we witnessed the co-
lossal destruction of the inhabitants
of city of the east

  we watched until the last inhab-

two years ago
i was bald all over
the top of my head
i felt ashamed

for people to see my
head i tried differ-
ent preparations
but they did no
good i remained
bald until i used

almost immediat-

growing in a short

itants of city of the east fell into the
city to vanish in a breath as their
falling cinder-bodies encountered the
black clouds which hung about the
skyscrapers then the enemy mar-
shaled forces for the return to the
submarines

darkness finally settled over all
that remained of city of the
east of all that vast myriad of
white men and women only lona
and i remained but still the cone
held us and we were being drawn
downward

  looking up we knew the reason
for the cone was narrowing above us
to become an ellipse narrowing and
retracting drawing us in and down
toward that pin-point of light whence
came the light of the cone

  swifter and swifter we dropped
downward forced by the narrowing
constricting cone until we stood at
last on the deck of that big submarine
we had first seen

  here men of color awaited us
they caught and removed us from
our monopters carried us into the
heart of the metal monster to stand
before the grim commander of the in-
vading aliens-a great lump of a
yellow man whose brow smooth as an
egg was so ponderous as to be ter-
rible housing plainly evident such a
brain as neither lona nor i had ever
before encountered

  i am sorry he said in our
language but it was all inevitable
the fortunes of war my friends and
you have lost as you are the last
representatives of your race i wish
to express to you the high respect in
which i have held you and my sor-
row that there was no half-way
ground upon which we could all
meet it was either you or we-and
we have triumphed as prisoners of
war you are to be executed but as a
brave man and woman who i see
love each other i leave you to choose

  so locked together in a room far
below the deck of the big submarine
together for our last hours on earth
as we shall be together in death we
have written in collaboration this
story of-city of the east the com-
mander of the aliens has promised
that it shall be published to the
world so that all living men what-
ever their color shall know of the
wonder the glory the awesome
grandeur of what was once the home
of the white race-wonderful city of
the east

  so it is finished and tomorrow we
die lona and i but our death shall
be glorious because of the promise of
the commander of the aliens from
the deck of the big submarine which
will emerge as part of the ritual of
our passing we will hurl ourselves
heavenward in our monopters which
were not destroyed at our capture to
the very ceiling

  there when we have gone as high
as we can we will face each other
my right arm will support lona
while with my left i remove the
headpiece of her monopter with a
flirt of her hand she will do the same
for me then we shall begin that
long plummeting descent toward the
atlantic which will be if our
strength holds in the ascent eighty
thousand feet below us

a restraining hand on my arm and
a voice not that friend ebson
one does not wantonly destroy the
relics of ancient art  

  i	turned and gazed full into the
face of lee clayton but it is in
there i exclaimed the proof of the
identity of a certain soldier

  he looked at me uncomprehend-
ingly a first gleam of early dawn
stole across the city and found its
way into the midst of the monu-
ments and pillars that now give but
a vague conception of the glory that
was rome wlien she was mistress of

  the truth is in there i assever-
ated   and the twenty centuries

telling stroke but instead dropped
it helplessly at my feet as i became
aware of the figure of a man
observing us with penetrating gaze
through the arch

that is joseph pollard lee
whispered hurriedly in my ear it
is he my enemy of whom i told you
yesterday

  nevertheless behold the certain
soldier i cried triumphantly

  you are both insane somnambu-
lists shrilled the voice of joseph
pollard and if either of you dares
to deface this arch i shall report you
to the authorities

  there was a ring of triumph in
his voice and a gleam of malice in
his eye as he strode through the
arch toward us i caught the glitter
of steel as he came through on our
side of the monument then a dis-

jargon and the sound of hurrying
footsteps dragged our attention to

 of the policemen for entering a
