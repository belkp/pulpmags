money in advertising

  the greatest most profitable most enjoyable
vocation for young men and women of the right
calibre is advertising never before has there
been such a demand for the skilful advertiser

 consider that some  publications
receive about a billion dollars annually for
advertising that hundreds of new houses
depending  advertising are constantly swel-
ling the business ranks that more millions
are expended for booklets and other advertis-
ing literature  that countless new fortunes
are being piled up through a scientific use of
printers ink  that even staid old institutions
from banks to law are joining in this great
advertising race for more profit and a faint
idea will he gained as to the splendid oppor-
tunities awaiting the skilled ad writer

  in the great work of fitting ambitious people to
eain double and quadruple ordinary salaries the
powell system of correspondence instruction
stands alone my graduates are everywhere
filling the best positions and showing what is in
store for others it is the onlv system heartily
endorsed by americas advertising authorities and
by the greatest advertising journal in the world

 my two free books net results and
prospectus explain the situation and tell ibout
the achievements of my graduates they also
indicate how business men can swell their profits

the eleventh rider

by f k scribner

a story of war-time in mexico and the mystery arising out of an innkeepers vow of vengeance

complete in this issue

          chapter i

the couriers from the north

the sun behind the sierra madre
was hanging a red ball in the west
before the door of the gray stone inn
senor perote stood shading his eyes
with his hand for the white dusty road
slanted toward the west and from that
direction came the sounds which had
brought the innkeeper to the door

   the rays of the sun fell full upon his
face and dazzled his eyes  he was unable
to discern plainly what might be ap-
proaching over the main highway but
then his ears were keen

  horses were nearing the tavern and
perote of the fifth generation of
thrifty innkeepers knew the approach
of horses might mean a lodger perhaps
several for the night

  of late the senor had witnessed on
many occasions a full house but with
each inroad of guests he had grown
poorer tor several weeks scarcely a
day passed but a shouting swearing
gang of cavalrymen or a company of
mounted infantry put up at the gray
stone inn cleaned the larder consumed
his fodder and departed northwestward
bidding him thank god such oppor-
tunity was given to serve the state

  senor perote accepted the honor
thrust upon him with a wry face and
thanked god-that they were gone
leaving a roof and four stout walls be-
hind them

       a

  the republic boasted no more zealous
citizen than lie yet he wished the high-
way which joined the capital with the
main road leading to the north had run
anywhere in all mexico except past his
dwelling

  but facing the west with back to the
capital perote breathed easier no
news had come of a great battle a battle
which was to scatter the americans to
the four winds therefore no consider-
able force of troops could be return-
ing-probably it was either a courier or
a civilian who was approaching if the
former he would not tarry for long and
the latter could be made to pay then
perote being a zealous mexican wanted
to hear ucavs from the front why
should he not be interested when he had
helped to feed half the cavalrymen who
were going to drive the yankees back
across the rio grande

  the cloud of dust arising like a puff
of smoke from the highway grew
larger from this cloud came into view
two horsemen the red and green of
whose uniform proclaimed them soldiers
of santa anna members of that peer-
less body of mexican cavalry upon which
the president depended to rout the in-
vaders

  senor perote passed his ljand across
his chin - a sign that he was disap-
pointed the cavalrymen drew up
their horses before the door

   god speed you senor said one
soberly we are glad to be here


the argosy

nothing has passed our lips since morn-
ing

  yon ride trorn the north senors
can it be possible the invaders are
already vanquished  suggested perote

  u curses no  growled the elder of
the horsemen a on the contrary
three of our battalions have been cut in
pieces we are hastening to summon out
the third reserve

  perote crossed himself it seemed
incredible what he heard

  the cavalrymen had dismounted and
were stamping about with an accompa-
niment of jingling spur and saber to
ease their cramped limbs

   then you are going to the capital  
asked perote

   no to chaleo there we will meet
a courier who will carry the order the
remaining distance oh santa anna
has thought of everything he whom
we are to meet will have a fresh horse
while ours are scarcely able to stand on
four legs we deliver the order obtain
a nights rest and return to the army
in the mean time the other is riding like
the devil to the capital and to-morrow
the reserve will be on their way

  it is wonderful  cried perote
 in santa anna the republic has found
another napoleon he is but biding his
time to cut the americans to pieces
one of the riders shrugged his shoul-
ders he had seen a regiment of the
despised americans put to rout five
times its number of mexicans and
behind this meager advance guard of
eight hundred men was general taylor
and a horde of the invaders

   it is three hours ride to chaleo
and we cannot tarrv here all night
broke in the second cavalryman pausing
in the act of rolling a cigarette

  perote took the hint

   i will hasten senors to put before
you such as i have but-there is no one
here to look to the horses my boys
have run away to join the army
the cavalryman with the cigarette
lighted it calmly blew a puff of smoke
toward the setting sun and began to
unbuckle his saddle girth

   go inside my friend wo will attend
to the horses said he lightly and re-
moving the heavy ornamented saddle
threw it on the ground

  senor perote entered the gray stone
building passed through one room and
opened the door of another a man who
had apparently been sleeping upon a
long bench started up blinking through
the semi-gloom

  perote closed the door softly

   there are without two cavalrymen
couriers from the north said he
shortly

  the man sat upright and pushed back
the matted hair from his forehead

   they are going to the capital   lie
asked

  to chaleo but there is to be a
courier from the capital awaiting them
he will carry forward an order to sum-
mon the third reserve

  and why the third reserve has
there been a battle  

  senor perote spread out his hands

   so it would seem and three bat-
talions cut in pieces mother of god  

  the man rose from the bench crossed
the room and looked out between the
slats which covered the lower part of the
window he was swarthy small agile
and moved with the softness of a cat
his eyes were set close together and his
hair was straight like that of an indian

  looking between the slats he studied
the two soldiers outside until perote
became impatient

   as you see some one has come
senor-senor-ijrrea havel not fol-
lowed instructions and done your bid-
ding two cavalrymen have ridden in
from the north and-i have awakened
you

   so you have said two couriers rid-
ing to summon the third reserve
answered senor urrea without turning
his head then he added  and they
will depart when they are satisfied 

  perote grumbled and shifted from
one leg to the other his companion
turned from the window

   perhaps it were well that these fine
cavalrymen sent to call out the third
reserve from the capital are not easily
satisfied perhaps it were better they
remain here until morning he said
calmly

   erote stopped one hand upon the
latch of the door

   but do they not carry an order from
santa anna himself are not the men
the eleventh rider



of the third reserve needed to supply
the place of the battalions which were
cut in pieces  he muttered

  that is as you understand it to
ride to the capital from this inn requires
eight hours from here to the headquar-
ters of the general is the same or more
to ride then for sixteen hours and with
horses that are weary

   now if they should break down on
the way what then  it is better my
good senor perote that these cavalry-
men wait until morning when both men
and horses can travel to better advan-
tage

   but they ride only to chaleo-
three hours-where a courier from the
capital awaits them expostulated
perote

   and you believe that  last night
i passed through chaleo it was before
midnight yet no one was in the street
no lights shone from the windows it
was dark and silent there because-be-
cause chaleo is deserted the men
have gone northward to the frontier
the women close their doors and crouch
hidden in the shadows after dusk
because-they fear to hear the tramping
feet of the american invaders

  in chaleo mother  of god
perote made the sign of the cross

  senor ijrrea continued calmly it
is more than possible and it is evident
you do not understand this people from
the north but i who have been many
times among them am not fooled so
easily

  perotes mouth was hanging open
he moistened his dry lips swallowing as
he did so his companion continued
with awful calmness

  you may well fear for listen my
friend  can tell you what others do
not know men say the horde of the
invaders is in the north and santa anna
lies between it and the capital but there
are some who have penetrated into
mexico it is not safe for one man or
even a small number to ride forth at
night

  pfrote stared in blank terror at the
speaker

  if it should happen he awake some
night to find the house surrounded by a
band of hostile horsemen he shud-
dered

  the face of senor urrea was impas-
sive but when he spoke he seemed
dreadfully in earnest

   listen said he  i rode from
chaleo last night on business for the
government scarcely an hour on my
journey and i perceived i was being
followed at the end of every rod i
halted and looked back for something
seemed to be rustling the bushes each
rock a bunch of grass a tree seemed to
be the hiding-place of an unseen animal
of wolves or the crouching figure of a
man finally i slipped into a narrow
path and waited the night was dark
and i saw no one but voices came to me
out of the blackness-voices whispering
in the tongue of the invader

  perote began to cross himself rapidly
completely terror-stricken at the others
sinister recital

   you are a friend to the republic
asked his companion suddenly-so sud-
denly that perote started violently and
clutched at the haft of the knife hidden
in the breast of his jacket

  who does not know that he
answered and thought of the soldiers
he had quartered without exacting pay-
ment

  then said senor urrea quietly
it is plainly your duty to detain these
cavalrymen until morning if they are
set upon and cut down how about the
third reserve which is to take the place
of the battalions cut to pieces  

  he stepped close to the trembling
innkeeper and laid- his hand upon his
shoulder

  and said he impressively what
might not happen if the third reserve
failed to join santa anna i will tell
you the americans might cut through
our lines and push on toward the capital
bv this road and-your house is a good
landmark my friend

  already perote saw his inn in flames
his few remaining cattle driven off
himself a prisoner doomed to execution
or a fugitive wandering among the
mountains

   is it then as bad as that surely
the good saints will protect us he
murmured in a weak voice

   when it comes to cold steel and
bullets the saints have business else-
where senor urrea replied calmly


the argosy

i was saying what might happen were
those sent by santa anna taken en route
to chaleo

  but to-morrow if they travel by
daylight inquired perote anxiously

   that is another matter in open
day those who lurk in the bushes will
not venture upon the high road

   they must remain until morning
muttered perote then facing his com-
panion but it will he no great dif-
ficulty for you to persuade them-you
who are first among the secret agents
of the government and close to santa
anna himself

  senor trrea shook his head

   if they are soldiers persuasion will
not stay them nor is it likely i shall an-
nounce-myself to those of whom i know
nothing as i have told you in confi-
dence  am accounted by santa anna
as a man of some value to the republic
if i am known as such by every one j
lose that value i cannot move in
 his matter but it is given you to do a
great work to-night-perhaps to save
mexico

  in gods name how demanded
perote excitedly

   by detaining the two cavalrymen
here until morning

   but you say they will not be per-
suaded

   there are two ways to everything
  perote rubbed his nose in perplexity
   if you will tell me he began

   if it should happen quoth senor
trrea that they fall into such sound
slumber that they do not awaken for
some hours it would be morning before
they would sit again in the saddle

   ah  said perote excitedly  you

were saying-

   that you will provide for them a

lottie of wine and--

   a dish of beans and a joaf of black
bread it is all j have

   what else you please so long as
you provide the wine but first bring the
latter to me said senor urrea and
with great deliberation he began to roll
a cigarette

  filled with the thought that to save
mexico from the invader the two cav-
alrymen must bo detained sit any cost
perote hastened to prepare the refresh-
ment

  the soldiers meantime were walking
back and forth before the house im-
patient to be on their way-the more
so because they knew they should not
have stopped at the inn but pushed on
straight to chaleo

  having prepared the beans over a
charcoal fire and set the dish with a loaf
of bread upon the table perote not
without some misgiving carried the
bottle of wine to seiior urrea the
latter received it gravely measured the
quantity with liis eye and took a small
glass vial from an inner pocket

  with great deliberateness he un-
corked the vial and allowed a given
number of drops to pass from it into the
mouth of the wine bottle after which
he handed the latter to the troubled
innkeeper

   it is neither too little nor too much
what are you staring at  he demanded
sharply

  it frequently happens that a man
dies easily if one or both of the cav-
alrymen should have a weak heart
stammered perote

  ou are a fool ejaculated the
other  do you imagine being what i
am i would do injury to the cause of the
republic  

    it is not that but sometimes one
may make a mistake

  seiior urrea made an impatient ges-
ture and at that moment the voice of
one of the cavalrymen was heard asking
why he was kept waiting

  perote smelled at the mouth of the
wine bottle hesitated and left the
room muttering under his breath

  being as he was an agent of the
mexican government and in the confi-
dence of santa anna himself why
should senor i rrea desire to harm sol-
diers of the republic

  he had measured the drops verv
carefully and there was in the wine onlv
a sulhcent quantity of the drug to throw
the drinkers into a profound sleep for
some hours and being asleep in the inn
theie oil i d be  danger of their fall-

ofthe hated amernt	

  this mental argument removed such
scruples as perote harbored in his mind
sating the wine upon the table beside
i he bread and beans he summoned the
tiie eleventh rider



impatient cavalrymen to partake of the
meager repast

  the soldiers attacked the food raven-
ously out having- eaten the more solid
portion seemed in no hurry to depart
the wine was extremely good and that
thev might the more fully enjoy it each
rolled himself a cigarette and amused
himself between regular sips of the
liquor by blowing rings of smoke toward
the ceiling

  at the end of half an hour perote
who had remained without in a torment
of doubt ventured to glance into the
room it was very quiet except for the
regular and heavy and clearly audible
breathing

  the two cavalrymen their red-and-
green jackets open at the neck were
leaning forward upon the table their
heads resting upon their arms the
innkeeper felt the pressure of a hand
upon his shoulder

   go out and lead the horses into a
shed where they can safely remain until
morning said the soft voice of senor
urrea

  when perote had left the room and
a noise without proved he was following
instructions the man who was in the
confidence of santa anna approached
the sleeping cavalrymen felt rapidly
through the clothing of each and
taking a knife from the table slit with
a quick stroke the lining of one of the
red-and-green jackets

  in another second he had transferred
from the cut to a pocket of his own coat
a carefully folded paper

  when perote returned from caring
for the horses he found the house
deserted except for the two soundly
sleeping soldiers senor urrea had
vanished

  had the perplexed innkeeper re-
turned at that moment to the shed
within which he had fastened the horses
he might have been the greatly sur-
prised eye-witness of a somewhat start-
ling and unusual procedure

  senor urrea was carefully placing a
saddle on the back of one of the horses
having fastened the girth he next pro-
duced a knife bent down and deliber-
ately hamstrung the remaining steed
the horse kicked and whinnied with
pain

  senor urrea passed out of a rear door
of the shed leading by the bridle the
animal he had saddled

chapter ii

  the martyrdom of senor perote

  it was well past midnight when the
first of tlx mexican cavalrymen awoke
from the stupor caused bv the drugged
wine for several moments he stared
stupidly around him at a loss to com-
prehend where he was or the meaning
of the heavy feeling in his head he
put out his hand and touched the empty
bean-pot a second later he knocked the
wine bottle off the table and the crash
served to bring him more thoroughly to
his senses

  getting upon his feet he began to
swear lustily and call loudly for a light
and perote warned by the crash of the
fallen bottle that he might expect
something from his guests appeared in
the doorway holding a sputtering can-
dle

  in gods name cried he i
thought you would sleep forever

  the soldier blinked stupidly then
suddenly realizing something of what
had taken place the volume of his oaths
redoubled

  snatching a huge silver watch from
his pocket he consulted the dial by the
flickering candle light the hands
marked a quarter to oue oclock

   may the devil fly away with you and
all that is yours he cried  you
have permitted us to sleep for six hours
we should have been in chaleo three
hours ago

  he seized his companion by the shoul-
der and shook him violently the
second cavalryman opened his eyes and
stretched himself slowlv whereupon the
other shook him the harder

  get up yaleno cried he fiercely
 it is long past midnight do you for-
get the courier waiting at chaleo

yaleno gave a tremendous yawn

  what courier he muttered then
checked himself suddenly and stared at
perote

  ah cried he now i remember
we were going to chaleo with an order
from santa anna
the argosy

   to summon the third reserve ven-
tured the landlord

   that was it and why then are we
here  demanded the cavalryman

  before perote could reply a startled
cry escaped the first soldier he was
examining the lining of his jacket in
which appeared a rent a foot long he
turned fiercely upon the amazed perote

  so it was you now  begin to
understand-why we have been asleep
you are a spy in the pay of the ameri-
cans

  he stooped and picked up the wine
bottle at the mouth -of which he smelled
carefully

  a thousand devils he cried and
yanked his short saber from its scab-
hard

  senor perote retreated toward the
open door the man whose jacket had
been cut open would surely have at-
tacked him with the saber had not the
second cavalryman interfered

   wail  cried he  if be lias hid-
den the-paper and you kill him we may
not be able to find it

  then drawing a pistol he covered the
trembling landlord

   the paper senor he said coldly

  perote crossed himself so rapidly that
he almost dropped the candle

   i know nothing of a paper god is
my witness seiiors this is not mv doing
he stammered

   do you deny we have been drugged
in this accursed hole of an inn  

  the click of the pistol hammer so in-
creased perotes fright that he began to
shake as one stricken by palsy

  i am a patriot was all he could
murmur

   so it seems said the man holding
the revolver and being a friend to
mexico you took the opportunity to
drug our wine and steal a government
document if you do not return the
paper we will kill you here if you do
return the paper you shall have the
benefit of a trial before judges at the
capital it is all one to us which you
choose

  the landlord fell upon his knees

   it was only to save you from being
taken and killed by the amerieans i
permitted senor urrea to drug the
wine he sobbed

   the cavalrymen exchanged glances

    senor urrea  they repeated in a
breath

    jt was senor urrea who told me of
the danger you would run did you pro-
ceed to chaleo after nightfall there
are bands of americans lurking beside
the highway

  but who the devil is this senor
urrea was it he then who took the
paper demanded the cavalrymen

  the muzzle of the pistol no longer
threatened perote so he became calmer

    senor urrea is in the confidence of
general santa anna t hough under ordi-
nary circumstances  would not mention
it many times he has passed through
the lines of the invader as water passes
through a sieve if he has taken a paper
from you i know nothing of it god is
my witness that i speak the truth it
was senor urrea himself who warned
me that you would be seized on the road
to chaleo and in that case the third re-
serve would not receive the order to
hasten to santa annas assistance

  the trembling landlord jerked out
the words piecemeal

  and where is this urrea de-
manded the cavalrymen

    god alone knows tie has vanished
completely replied the landlord
weakly

   the elder of the two soldiers turned
to his companion

   it is plain this fellow is cither a
fool or is lying wonderfully said he
coldly c- in any case it is through him
we find ourselves ruined

   then with a terrible oath

   for the contents of that paper the
americans would willingly give your
weight in silver if it falls into the
hands of general taylor santa anna
and our army will be cut in a thousand
pieces

  and we will be hogged to death in
the public square at the capital added
his companion fiercely

   perotes eyes rolled so that onlv the
whites were visible

   but it was to summon the third re-
serve you ride to chaleo vou yourself
so told me senor had you but said
vou carried a paper of such value to the
republic i would have defended you
even with my life he cried
the eleventh rider



    that is likely and as you are going
to die i do not mind telling you though
you doubtless know it already the
paper which has been taken from us
gave the strength and future movements
of the army of the republic-each com-
pany each regiment each battalion

   what is more if the americans ob-
tain  they will know of the expedition
sent inco the hills which was to fall upon
them unawares oh santa anna will
be pleased to learn what has been lost-
if he is not attacked and cut in pieces
before the news reaches him did he
not caution us to die rather than let that
paper leave our possession were we
not honored above all men in the army
that he sent us to the capital with so
important a message

  the soldier struck his hands together
in despair and rage but the last of the
sentence was lost upon the terror-
stricken innkeeper

   in the name of god senors of all
this i know nothing even of senor

urrea-

   you are either a fool or worse and
in either case to kill you will benefit the
republic retorted one of the cavalry-
men savagely  if you took the paper
yourself or permitted another to rob
mexican officers in your house it is all
the same

  perote began to beg piteously sud-
denly oue of the cavalrymen struck the
table a blow with his fist

   there is one thing can be done and
every moment is precious it is clear
the paper is gone but if word can be
got to santa anna before the americans
make use of the knowledge it gives
them something may be saved watch
this fellow  will saddle my horse and
ride north like the devil to reach
headquarters by daybreak is no great
matter

   and what will you tell santa anna
that we have permitted the paper to be
stolen while we slept asked the other
dryly

     have not thought what t shall tell
him but he must know what has fallen
into the enemys hands

  he rushed from the room perote
began to pluck up hope but the sudden
return of the cavalryman threw him
into deeper terror and despair the

face of the mexican was white with t-age
and for a moment he could only glare
at the unfortunate innkeeper

   what is it asked his companion
in quick alarm

   one of the horses is gone and

the other- the cavalryman was

almost choking with rage u the other
has been hamstrung and is utterly use-
less he concluded

  to a mexican a good horse is one of
the first things in the world and this
one had found his mount cruelly slashed
with a knife he turned upon the
quaking landlord and asked in a terrible
voice

  and was it this senor urrea who
did that i will answer yes for you
and urrea are one and the same you
shall give us the paper and afterward
you shall suffer for what i saw out
there

   but one of the horses is gone it
was sen or urrea who-

  a violent blow on the mouth checked
the words the next moment he was
lying on his back with one of the caval-
rymen kneeling on his chest

   go to the stable and fetch a rope
said the latter to his companion  we
will see whether this fellow will remem-
ber where he has hidden the paper

  when the rope was brought perote
was bound so securely that he could
move only his head and the ends of his
fingers

  where is the paper demanded
the elder of his captors

  the unfortunate landlord almost un-
conscious from terror uttered an in-
articulate reply

   as i passed the door of the kitchen
i saw a brazier of burning charcoal get
it said the officer who had found his
horse hamstrung

  his companion left the room to re-
turn with the glowing brazier which he
set upon the floor within plain sight of
the hapless innkeeper

  perote watched the burning charcoal
as though the red glow fascinated him
and he could not close his eyes he saw
one of the cavalrymen thrust the end of
the short ramrod of his pistol into the
center of the glowing mass several
minutes passed in silence the end of the
ramrod assumed a rosy color the cav-


the argosy

alryman gave it a turn then stood up	pain inthe wtehes

and said in a passionle voice	cane  	which he had

 will ask you again-where nave
you hidden the paper  

perote uttered a cry and being de-
prived of speech shook his head vio-

lently

  we shall see said the mexican
coldly and with the table-cloth as a
guard to protect his hand from the heat
of the metal he removed the ramrod
from the-bed of charcoal the next in-
stant perote uttered a piercing shriek
for the red hot point of the iron was
thrust in contact with his flesh

   the paper  demanded the cavalry-
man

  suddenly the feeling of terror left
perotes body the pain of the burn
filled him only with rage lie closed
his lips tightly but his eyes continued
to glare at his captors

  the cavalrymen looked at each other

   if you will not tell  cried one
fiercely and lifted the iron the second
time

  perote gritted his teeth together but
after a time all sense of pain seemed to
be leaving him his head swam violently
then he lost consciousness

  when he opened his eyes daylight was
streaming through the window into the
room things remained much as he
remembered them except the charcoal
in the brazier no longer gave out a red
glow

  for a time he could only move his
head from side to side for his body
seemed to be seared with lines of fire and
he remembered they had bound him se-
curely

  then he became aware that he could
move one of his hands the hot end
of the ramrod had come in contact with
the cord which held his right wrist and
the hemp was severed

  slowly perote loosed one after an-
other the bonds which held him care-
fully getting upon his feet he leaned
heavily against the table his brain
dizzy and every inch of his body smart-
ing

  then mechanically he began to count
the burns which he had received at the
hands of santa annas officers three
were upon his hands but to these he

hung a small mirror which he had
grudgingly taken in payment for a
nights lodging now he blessed the
dav when it had been forced upon him

lie passed slowly from the room and
approached the glass dreading to look
into it but urged by an uncontrollable
impulse a mexican is proud of his
good looks and perote was still a young

man	

  that which stared out at him irom
the dingv glass brought a groan to his
white lips the face once passing
comely was frightfully disfigured by
two deep burns extending from the
middle of the chin upward to a point
below each ear these burns formed
the letter x it was as though the man
was gazing out upon the worid through
two crossed bars

   in the first moment the luckless land-
lord gave way to a feeling of despair it
would have been more merciful had
they killed him while his mind was
blank

   then the devilish cruelty of the thing
came home to him the smarting of
the burns would cease but the livid bars
must always rest across his face in all
mexico there was not a man so plainly
marked for ridicule-and pity

  perote remembered how a certain girl
in the far-off capital had once clung to
him when a beggar marked with the
smallpox had brushed against her in the
street

  suddenly the hopes he had cherished
the goal toward which he had labored
crumpled to ashes before his mental vis-
ion the victim of the dread disease was
less disfigured than he

  for a few moments he leaned against
the wall his hands clenched until the
nails bit into the palms despair master-
ing him completely then a sudden
transformation was apparent in a
single moment perote the timid land-
lord oi the wayside inn gave place to a
-man whose heart held only bitter
hatred from being a moral coward
fearful of suffering he became imbued
with a spirit which would stop at no
danger or fear of god or man

  l or some time the mexican stood
be ore the little mirror and the face that
the eleventh rider

looked out at him wore a dreadful smile
then deliberately he set about uursing
his wounds with a preparation which he
knew would lessen the pain and cause
the burns to heal quickly having
made himself more comfortable he pre-
pared his usual morning meal ate it
slowly and sallied forth to make an ex-
amination of the premises

  as he expectcd the body of a horse
lay in the stable the mexican officer had
shot his useless beast through the head
he and his companion departing on foot
but whether northward or toward the
capital perote did not trouble himself
to decide just then

  it remained for him to bury the dead
animal and set his house in order there
would doubtless be soldiers from the
north or south passing over the high-
way and they would stop at the inn

  but during that day and the next it
seemed as though no other living soul
was in mexico for not even a rancher
called but on the third day near
evening perote leaning against the
horse-post before the house tossed
away his cigarette and going to the
little mirror arranged the bandages
which concealed his burns

  a party of horsemen were approach-
ing from the north riding so leisurely
that the innkeeper knew they would not
push on to chaleo and the capital but
would pass the night under his roof

chapter iii

the ftrst of the invaders

  the newcomers proved to he a de-
tachment from the army of santa
anna as they pulled up before the
door senor perote counted nine horse-
men commanded by a captain of cav-
alry

  but what riveted his attention was
the eleventh rider-a man whose hands
were bound behind his back and who
was securely fastened to the saddle by
a rope passing around his waist the
ten mexicans were escorting a prisoner
southward and this prisoner was one
of the horde of invaders who had
crossed the rio grande to lay waste the
land

the captive gazed down upon senor

perote out of a pair of cold blue eye
and perote returned the gaze- with
curious interest the soldiers dis-
mounted and the officer clattered
across the uneven strip of ground to
the door of the hostelry

  he looked at seiior perote in a puz-
zled manner

  the good senor perote said he

  perote had housed and fed this same
mexican not two weeks before when he
rode northward with a hundred swearing
gucrrilleros at his back it was evident
however the officer did not fully recog-
nize to whom he was speaking

  the innkeeper smiled grimly

   i am senor perote said he quietly

  the officer began to roll a cigarette

  you did not wear those decorations
a week ago my friend said he

  perote shook his head and touched
the bandages

   surely you have not been with the
army ventured the captain

  no perote answered impassion-
ately

   then it was an accident and not a
saber cut

  it was not an accident senor an-
swered the innkeeper

   then what in gods name- 

   it was the americans it was lucky
i escaped with mv life replied perote
calrrilv

  the officer looked incredulous

   within eight hours of the capital
surely you do not mean it seiior

  the prisoner tied to his saddle was
leaning forward listening

  suddenly perotes face assumed an
expression of dreadful anger the
next instant he had drawn a knife and
sprang straight at the defenseless amer-
ican

  one of the soldiers threw himself in
the way another seized the uplifted arm
and a third took possession of the knife
the officer shrugged his shoulders

   ah said he  i can believe it was
the americans so they have spoiled
your beauty my friend but surely it
was not that one 

  no muttered perote but he is
an american it is sufficient reason
whv i should kill him

   in time growled the officer  only
it happens he is wanted in the capital-


the argosy

where are those who ask questions if
it were not for that i would not have
put myself to the trouble of guarding
him so carefully across the country

   is he then a spy   asked perote
with sudden interest

   that is as you will but in any case
he is to die it is enough that he was
caught on this side of the rio grande
the general santa anna is resolved to
deal sternly with certain of these north-
erners

  the prisoner nodded gravely and ad-
dressed perote in excellent spanish

   you perceive senor what is to be
done with me-to-morrow or the next
day but in the mean time one desires
to be as comfortable as possible i have
eaten nothing for twenty hours and
judge that you keep an inn

  the officer laughed

   he is a bold one evidently not fear-
ing death it is because of that we have
bound him so carefully i do not mind
telling you that the poor devil has been
traveling on an empty stomach you
see we were short of rations

  perote scowled darkly and looked up
at the prisoner

   it may chance i can spare half a
loaf but not being a friend of the re-
public payment will be required
growled he

   which you doubtless know i cannot
make since your friends have relieved
me of the little money i possessed re-
plied the american

   then you must go to bed hungry
already  have given away more than i
can afford said perote coldly

   and there are ten mouths to fill i
warrant we will clean the larder for you
my friend interposed the officer dryly

  the inn over which five generations
of perotes had held sway boasted of two
stories it was in a small room under the
roof that the mexicans elected to confine
their prisoner for the night that all
possibility of escape might be obliter-
ated care was taken to rebind his hands
securely to his sides and his legs were
fastened firmly at the ankles

  he was then thrown upon the rude
bed and a third rope passed across his
body and around the crude piece of
furniture

  perote also took the precaution to

nail a board over the window the key
of the door was in possession of the
officer bound as he was the american
could have been left in the yard with no
fear but that he would be there in the
morning

  the mexicans sat long at table de-
manding much and cursing among
themselves that more variety was not
forthcoming as for perote he found
his hands full until a late hour for after
the riders had been fed the horses must
be attended to

  thrice he stole up the ladder which
led to the second story and listened at
the door of the prisoners room each
time he heard nothing the little room
was still as death

  it was not without interest that he
watched the preparations of the sol-
diers to retire the man who was
selected to guard the prisoner spread
his blanket upon the floor outside the
door with his feet against the panels

  the captive could not leave the
apartment by way of the window the
opening of the door would arouse the
mexican and to try his skill on either
door or window the american must first
untie the knots which it had required a
quarter of an hour to secure

  the captain was the last to retire
before doing so he accosted senor
perote as the latter was bolting the
front door

   we must be away at sunrise it
might be wise my friend to give the
american a cup of coffee in the morn-
ing we cannot have him tumbling from
the saddle through weakness

  perote growled an inarticulate reply
put out the lights and retired into the
kitchen where the house being full he
had spread his bed

  he shut the door carefully placed a
candle close to the little mirror and be-
gan to dress the half-healed burns
having finished he blew out the light
and threw himself fully dressed upon
the couch

  for a long time he lay gazing up into
the blackness but after what might
have been two hours he rose crossed
the room noiselessly opened the door
leading into the larger part of the build-
ing and listened intently

  the heavy breathing of exhausted
the eleventh rider



sleepers came from behind the parti-
tions perote passed silently across the
main room and paused at the foot of the
ladder leading to the upper story

  for several moments he remained mo-
tionless then the faint creaking of the
ladder marked his cautious ascent he
had now merely to thrust his head
through the opening to hear everything
that was occurring in the narrow hall
which ran the length of the building
where the soldier guarding the prison-
ers door was sleeping

  after a time the listener appeared to
be satisfied for he withdrew his head
frcin the opening and crept down the
ladder

  having reached the lower floor he
passed into the kitchen took a bundle
from the table and unbolting and open-
ing the door leading into the yard
passed out into the night

  it was dark except for the light of
countless stars perote crossed the
yard to the stable threw off the latch
which fastened the door and moving
cautiously along in the rear of the
horses carefully counted the animals

  fpon reaching the sixth he stopped
spoke soothingly to the beast and un-
tied the rope which passed through a
ring in the wall above the manger it
was the animal which had been ridden
by the mexican cavalry officer that was
thus separated from its fellows

  having loosed the horse perote took
from a peg a heavy saddle laid it upon
the beasts back and adjusted the girth
firmly having done this he picked up
the bundle he had taken from the table
in the kitchen and fastened it behind
the saddle

  this task being completed he led the
horse to the door of the stable attached
the bridle to a ring in the wall and
closing the door softly stepped once
more into the night

  tjpon the ground in the rear of the
inn lay a ladder the same by which
perote had mounted when he nailed the
board across the window of the room
occupied by the prisoner

  moving rapidly and silently in the
darkness he now raised this ladder car-
ried it around the house and placed it
against the side of the building under
the same window

  at the end of another minute a faint
rasping sound was heard the nails
which had been driven into the board
were dropped one by one to the ground
and perote descending the ladder laid
the piece of plank upon the grass

  then with the noiselessness of a
cat he crept again upon the rounds
listened for a moment at tlie aperture
and stepped into the black void of the
little room

  it required but a few steps to cross
it and perote stood beside the bed on
which lay the american had there
been light one might have seen the
mexican draw a knife from his belt
bend down and feel with his free hand
for the body of the prisoner

  the american stirred and strained at
his bonds perhaps he felt the presence
of the knife in the mans hand

  perote uttered a sharp low sentence
in the name of god lie quiet
senor and-listen

  the strain upon the cords ceased the
prisoner stretched upon his back his
eyes wide open was vainly striving to
pierce the blackness

   give heed senor for the time is
short whispered perote you are
of those who have come into the re-
public from across the rio grande and
they are taking you to the capital that
certain ones may ask questions and
afterward kill you is it not so
it would seem that you are cor-
rectly informed but first they would
starve me as perhaps also you have
observed replied the prisoner shortly
then in a burst of subdued passion
 what they may do to me afterward
falls through the fortune of war but
the last-kill that miserable wretch who
denied me even a crust of black bread
and i will die satisfied

  the fingers which grasped the hilt
of the knife tightened but after a mo-
ment perote answered calmly

   i am that one-who denied you
brfore the door now i have come
senor to give you more than bread yet
first you will listen to what i have to
say

  the prisoner lav perfectly still cither
from astonishment or because he did not
know what to answer

    desire first of all to know your


the argosy

same and how you were taken con-
tinued perote quietly

  ah muttered the prisoner it
was while on a scout beyond san rafael
and i am a virginian-haddon of
harneys h orse

   you are perhaps an officer in the
army of the americans 

   yes  a lieutenant but i cant see
what that has to do with the present
situation

   perhaps because it is very dark
senor but outside it is a little lighter
it has come about that i desire in the
army of the americans to possess a
friend-one if it should so happen i
appear before your general taylor who
will vouch for my honesty if it is per-
mitted you to return to the ranks of the
invaders will it be as i desire senor
haddon  

   fll see to it that you dine with the
president in washington and be pre-
sented with a congressional medal as a
life-saver answered the american lieu-
tenant so heartily that perote glanced
anxiously toward the door

   and you will know me by- he

began then checked himself and drew
his breath sharply

   yes ill know you broke in the
lieutenant but for gods sake get me
out of here we can do the talking
afterward

  perote bent down felt for the cords
and with three deft strokes of the knife
severed them each in turn

  the american tried to rise then fell
back cursing softly

   it is the weakness muttered
perote drink senor it will
strengthen you

  he held the mouth of a flask to the
others lips and lieutenant haddon
swallowed a few gulps of a fiery liquor
it burned like molten metal and set his
head reeling but as though by magic
renewed strength returned into his
muscles

  ne raised himself caught perotes
arm for support and got unsteadily
upon his feet

   gently senor whispered the mexi-
can  there is one sleeping outside the
door we must descend the ladder a
false step may awaken those who will
form obstacles

  just how he managed to cross the
room climb through the window and
descend the twelve feet of ladder to the
ground haddon to liis dying day could
not explain

  llis head was ringing like a kettle-
drum his arms and legs were stilf and
cramped for want of circulation and
the liquor taken on an empty stomach
was playing sad havoc with his senses

  he felt the firm ground under his
feet and was aware that his companion
was supporting him then things be-
came clearer and he found himself
standing beside the stable the door of
which perote held open

  from out of the darkness came the
smell of horses and the sound of their
restless movements

  you are about to mount the horse
of senor the captain it is a strong
beast and will carry you many miles
without a halt said perote quietly

  haddon drew in long breaths of the
invigorating night air it cleared his
head and he began to realize more
keenly the situation

  yet this situation puzzled him
from being a helpless prisoner tied to
an uncomfortable bed of straw he had
been transported almost in an instant
to the side of a horse which was to carry
him to freedom

  he began a question but his strange
companion interrupted almost rudely

  there is strapped behind the saddle
sufficient food for two meals and a
flask of liquor it were better however
to dine upon the way senor at any
moment some one within may awaken

   thank you my friend i shall not
forget to-night  said hadden heartily
i hen suddenly but why have you
done this knowing me to be an ameri-
can i have you not said it was certain
of the americans who gave you cause
to wear those bandages 

    i lied senor lieutenant it was not
the americans who tortured me re-
plied perote briefly

  haddon was in no humor to seek to
gratify his curiosity further what he
most desired was to put as much space
as possible between himself and the ten
-mexicans asleep in the inn

  i erote had led the horse into the
open
the eleventh rider



  - the senor will ride straight toward
the north not until he reaches the
vicinity of san antonio will there be
danger of meeting bands of guerrilleros
said he

   which  shall take care to avoid as
 would the devil answered haddon
with conviction

   but if it should happen any oue
should desire to stop the senor and to
ask unpleasant questions it would be
well i know how to answer continued
perote grimly

  he took from his belt the knife and
a pistol and handed them to the amer-
ican

   thanks my friend said haddon

  he put one foot -in the stirrup and
swung himself into the saddle as he
was in the act of gathering up the reins
perote laid his hand upon his knee

   a moment senor yen have forgot-
ten something which should not be neg-
lected said he quietly

  haddon checked the impulse to urge
the horse forward

  it is the sign by which you may
know me afterward there are other
perotes in mexico so a name signifies
nothing but a moment longer senor
concluded the innkeeper grimly

  and at the same instant a light flared
up between his fingers

  the young officer looked down in
mute surprise with a quick movement
perote slipped off the bandages and
held the light so that it shone full upon
his face

  haddon uttered a sharp exclamation
across the mans countenance the dis-
figuring x showed hideously livid
framing his face as it were between
two unsightly bars stamped upon the
flesh

  at that instant the light went out

chapter iv

senor perote loses sojie property

  senor perote stood several minutes
in the gloom listening to the rapidly
receding sound of hoof beats upon the
hard roadway then as one who had
carefully planned out all beforehand he
set about putting into action a deliber-
ate move

  his first care was to take away the
ladder and return it to its place behind
the house having done so he returned
to the stable reentered it and opened
the rear door he then passed along the
line of horses untied the halter of each
one and drove the animals into the
open air

  returning for the fourth time that
night into the shed he gathered to-
gether a heap of straw struck a light
and bending down deliberately applied
the ilame to the combustible material

  having set the spark which would
destroy a portion of his own property
perote hastened back to the inn bolted
the rear door behind him and making
certain by glancing out of the window
that the blaze from the burning straw
had communicated with the woodwork
of the stable he threw off his jacket

  then ruffling his hair he rushed with
loud cries into the main portion of the
tavern calling upon the sleeping cav-
alrymen to bestir themselves

  aroused suddenly by so great a com-
motion the mexicans appeared intense
alarm written upon their faces the
captain seized perote by the shoulder

   in cods name senor have they
then returned   he shouted to the ex-
cited landlord

  senor perote shook himself free

   llow can i tell  but it is more than
possible for the barn is on fire he
cried

  at the same moment he threw open
the front door

  the mexican officer was as quick to
throwr himself upon the swinging
portal and close it hastily

  what would you do if the house
is surrounded by the americans they
will rush in and take us where we
stand cried he

  out shouted perote and fall
upon them do you not perceive your
horses will be roasted alive

   captain seized himself by the
hair

   mother of god yet we will be shot
one by one as we rush forth it is as
light as day out there

   and my barn with a quantity of
fodder and half a seasons cutting of
oats is being destroyed cried perote
excitedly


the argosy

  then in a terrible voice

  alone i will defend ray property
one had rather die than to stare ruin in
the face

  the officer assisted by one of the
soldiers threw himself upon the appar-
ently frenzied man perote struggled
bit tore with his nails and bellowed
like a bull

  at the end of several minutes the
others succeeded in subduing him but
only at the cost of much skin and
clothing perote panting glared sav-
agely from one to the other

   cowards  cried he  the invaders
quietly surround the house set fire to
the stable and you remain safely be-
hind bolted doors you will not even
allow me to sally forth and drive them
away

  the officer began to calm him at the
same time wiping the blood from his
own face where the others nails had
left their marks

  m you are crazy my friend what can
one man do against a company of the
americans  he panted

   but there are eleven of us mut-
tered perote savagely

   behind these walls we may be able

to do something but out there-

the mexican shrugged his shoulders

  perote fell upon a chair then sprang
up suddenly

   they will rescue the prisoner up-
stairs at least allow me to put my knife
between his ribs cried he fiercely

  at that very instant the ladder
creaked loudly and the cavalryman who
had been asleep before the door of the
prisoners room appeared before them

  the american is gone  cried he

  the captain seized him by the arm

   it is not possible ten horses could
not break those bonds he began but
perote interrupted

   do you not understand cried he
 the americans have followed you for
the purpose of rescuing the prisoner
some have crawled quietly through the
window and untied him while you slept
oh should santa anna hear of this 

  the mexican officer turned pale

   but that is not likely continued
perote with awful calmness  for no
one will leave this place alive to tell of
it it was an evil hour when you

stopped at the inn else had i now been
sleeping peacefully in my bed instead of
waiting to be shot or hanged to one of
yonder trees

  for several moments silence reigned
in the room then as no bullets came
through the windows the mexicans be-
gan to pluck up courage

   they are afraid muttered one
 and dare not attack the house for they
know who is inside

  the captain rattled the scabbard of
his saber

   it will not be well for them to do
so for they would be cut in ten thou-
sand pieces said he fiercely  let but

one of the dogs show his face and-

  there came a tramping of hoofs with-
out and several dark forms passed be-
tween the window and the roaring
flames bursting from the stable

  a cavalryman raised his carbine and
fired through the window the tramp-
ing grew louder then ceased suddenly

  for a time those within the house
waited in breathless silence finally
perote muttered

   is it possible that one shot has
driven them away

   that shows what you know of fight-
ing they liave only withdrawn out of
gunshot replied the officer knowingly

   just the same returned perote
 i will venture out and see if they are
there there is a rear door i will open
it softly and creep around the house
you can close it after me

  the captain thought deeply for
several moments finally he said

   	ou are indeed a brave man and
should leave this tavern business in
order that you may join the army and
use your valor to advantage  will per-
mit you to go if you will be careful

   it is my purpose to join the army
i ovided i can obtain something in re-
turn my father was a great fitrhter
answered perote modestly

  he passed through the building fol-
lowed by the captain and unbolted the
rear door he was scarcely outside when
the bolt was shot again in placfe

  perote walked a dozen rods sat down
upon the ground with his back against a
tree and waited for half au hour then
lie arose crept around the building and
scratched on the front door
the eleventh rider



  after a little a voice from within de-
manded who was there

  perote made himself known and bad
them unbolt the door after some con-
siderable delay this was done

   i have been all about the place and
there is nothing to be seen except a
dead horse lying between here and the
ruins of the stable said perote calmly

   then the americans have lost one
of their horses while we remain intact
answered the captain exultingly

   except that your horses were in the
barn suggested perote

  oh the devil muttered the cap-
tain  i had not thought of that

   and the prisoner is gone added
perote

  the captain began to swear

   to say nothing of my stable and a
great mass of valuable fodder perote
concluded sorrowfully

  the captain struck his hands to-
gether

   listen my friend said he soberly
 we have all lost something to-night
but the case with us is most serious it
is well if this affair does not reach the
ears of santa anna for he is a terrible
man when his anger is aroused

   you have lost part of your property
and keeping an inn is unsafe at such a
time any way you will go with us to
the quarters of santa anna  shall tell
the general that you are the bravest
man in mexico and the wounds on your
face will back up the statement in re-
turn you will also do us a favor 

  and what is that asked perote

   hold your tongue about what has
occurred here to-night or more prop-
erly agree to what i shall say

   trial is easy enough provided i am
not compromised perote answered

   how can you be and i shall stick
partly to the truth it will be carried
to santa annas ears that stopping for
the night at this place we were set upon
by a force of the americans and de-
fended the house valiantly

  it happened however that certain
shots from without entered the building
and one striking the prisoner in the
head killed him we can thus account
for nol taking him to the capital for
a dead man would be of no use to those
who ask questions

   but none of your men are wounded
if there was such a combat how can that
be accounted for asked perote

   the walls protected us and it has
been known where those engaged in
battle escaped with their lives do you
agree to assist us in this matter in
return i will obtain for you an audience
with santa anna which is not so easy
a matter you may be assured

  seiior perote thought for several
moments then agreed to what the cap-
tain had requested after that the ten
mexicans breathed easier especially as
they began to suspect that no great
force of the enemy had approached the
tavern

  it was probable that only a handful
had been in the neighborhood these
had assisted the prisoner to escape fired
the stable and made oil fearing capture
by the inmates of the house

  during the remainder of the night no
one slept except perote and the officer
awakened him at the first signs of day-
light the mexicans had discovered
that the dead horse in the yard was one
of their own

  the other animals had also been
found at no great distance from the inn 
only the captains horse was missing
having either wandered away or been
carried off

  there appeared more reason than
ever to carry a falsehood to head-
quarters for if santa anna knew the
true state of affairs his anger would be
terrible to witness

  perote prepared the morning meal
and set about closing the inn this he
accomplished bv nailing boards across
the doors and windows

  during the first hour of the journey
northward which was necessarily slow
for two of the horses were burdened
with a pair of riders the cavalcade rode
in silence later in the morning how-
ever stopping to water the animals
perote approached the captain

   i would ask you senor if you hap-
pen to have heard of one called yalena
among the soldiers of the republic he
asked

  there is a valeno at headquarters
he happens to be related to santa anna
himself but  do not know him person-
ally the captain answered


the argosy

   he is then something in the army
of the republic

   that is as you will he is frequently
intrusted with important messages

   i think said perote carelessly
 that he has honored my house on more
than one occasion the last time he
traveled southward with a companion
 oh that must have been captain
amador who also enjoys the generals
confidence replied the officer and went
on to describe the elder of the two men
who had put perote to the torture

  perote rejoined the group of cavalry-
men with a curious expression on his
face his lips moved frequently repeat-
ing the words  valeno  and  am-
ador amador and valeno

  once he pressed his fingers lightly
over the bandages which crossed his
face

  having watered the horses the caval-
cade proceeded upon the journey riding
northward toward the rio grande it
was well past the noon hour when it
drew up near a small village where the
captain had expressed his determination
to dine

  but as they approached the miser-
able tavern the presence of a dozen
horses in front of the door gave warning
that others were before them and that
these were members of santa annas
army was evident for the men who
guarded the horses were in uniform
the captain pulled in his mount

   a thousand curses  growled he
 there is to be found in such places
scarcely sufficient food for three hungry
men and ee who are before us we
shall get nothing here that is certain
still he urged forward his horse and
followed by his men and perote rode up
to the door of the tavern

  where are you going he de-
manded of one of the men who were
guarding the horses

   to the capital senor replied the
soldier  have you come from there 
 only part way are you acting as
an escort or what

   yes and no but we are hunting for
certain ones and one in particular who
is dangerous to the welfare of the re-
public

   of whom are you speaking-an
american  

   who can tell that senor for
scarcely any one has seen him it is re-
portedthat he is more than half wolt

and avoids people easily it is said that
a certain innkeeper between here and
chaleo has seen and talked with him

   but surely you know something of
the man for whom you are looking else
how will you tell when you come across
him  

   that may be known to our captain
but nothinghas been explained to us
only that we are looking for a spy who
is sharper than the devil himself

   and who is your captain  

   it is senor amador who is at this
moment dining within

  the cavalryman behind whom perote
was seated felt a sudden sharp move-
ment the ex-tavern keeper was slip-
ping from the back of the horse to the
ground

  the captain was speaking

  i will join senor amador we once
served in the same regiment said he
and dismounting bade his men await
his return

   this means an empty stomach until
the next village is reached he will eat
but we are allowed to go hungry
growled one of the troopers making a
wry -face

  then catching sight of perote moving
cautiously toward the rear of the tavern
he called

  it is fortunate my friend that you
are not yet a soldier for you can go
where you please if you find anything
save half a loaf for me i will not forget
the favor

  but perote did not seem to hear he
was thinking only of who was in the
house and that did captain amador
appear suddenly it would be better were
he not visible the time to come face
to face with the man who had tortured
him had not yet arrived

  in the rear of the tavern was a win-
dow and as perote approached this
voices fell upon his car a conversation
was being carried on between the officer
he had accompanied and captain ama-
dor

   so you are going northward well
it wore better that you accompany me
lor  am commissioned to pick up any
small command i chance to meet  the
the eleventh rider

n

road this is the more necessary as no
one knows the number of those for
whom i am looking

  the speaker was captain amador

  there are then more than one
his companion inquired

   god knows but report has it that
a dangerous band of the enemy has
managed to get past our lines and is
hovering between here and the capital
no one knows how this has happened
but it is so to a certainty it is my busi-
ness to overtake this pack of northern
wolves and kill or make them prisoners

  it is also my purpose to go to the
capital where i hear a prisoner has been
lately taken i desire to question him
for through him i hope to catch the
others

   but it is commonly reported that
these americans are not given to over-
much talking

  captain amador uttered a short
laugh

   never fear i can find a way to open
the lips of this one in such matters
i have had some experience

  the fumes of cigarette smoke floated
through the window

   it is only once i failed and then it
was because the fellow died too quickly
continued the other coolly

  perote smiled horribly

   we shall see lie muttered

  well what do you decide de-
manded captain amador

   i shall go with you of course
though i am short of horses replied
the other

   i can get you an extra horse or two
and by the way having come from the
south did you see or hear anything of
the party that was conducting the pris-
oner to the capital  

   nothing i must have come by an-
other way

  perote breathed more easily tie had
feared the officer would make known his
presence with the detachment but it
was plainly his intention to avoid all
mention of having stopped at an inn en
route

   we will push forward rapidly and
pass the night at chaleo there is an
inn between here and there but i wish
to avoid such places after nightfall
said captain amador

       	a

  his companion was thinking he would
have done better had he avoided a cer-
tain inn and replied

   chaleo will suit me as well as any
place when will you start  he asked

   as soon as possible your men need
not tarry here to dine for there is
nothing to eat in the house i have as-
sured myself of that

  ten minutes later the two squads of
mexican cavalry were in the saddle the
officer whom perote had accompanied
looked about him

   where is our innkeeper  he asked

   i think he has gone senor captain
for i saw him making for yonder clump
of trees answered the cavalryman

  the officer shrugged his shoulders

   perhaps he has changed his mind
about entering the army and i have
no business to delay the journey in
hunting for him after all it were bet-
ter he did not accompany us captain
amador has a way of asking questions
said he

  it was late in the afternoon or more
properly early in the evening when the
cavalcade rode into chaleo senor
urrea had told perote that the place
was deserted after nightfall it was not
quite that but nearly so

  but half a score of persons were met
by the horsemen and these skulked
past as though their only thought was
to seek a friendly shelter but few of
the houses avere lighted even the bark-
ing of dogs so common to a mexican
town was lacking

  the cavalrymen drew up finally be-
fore a house somewhat larger than the
rest it was one of the three public inns
which chaleo boasted

  the landlord opened the door gin-
gerly made a wry face at sight of the
score of troopers and then advanced to
take the bridles of the officers horses

  captain amador gave a few sharp
orders and accompanied by his com-
panion in arms entered the tavern the
troopers dismounted led their horses to
the sheds in the rear of the main dwell-
ing and entered the house by a side
door

  after a time one appeared with two
plates containing food which he handed
to the men guarding the horses after
which he returned to the inn


the argosy

  an hour or more passed a watery
moon began to climb the heavens and
a weird silence brooded over the town
the soldiers guarding the horses swore
softly and looked at the somber out-
lines of the silent tavern and beyond to
the darker line of lofty mountains

  they could imagine their comrades
sleeping soundly while they must cool
their heels under the stars

  several hours passed the guards
grown drowsy leaned against the wall
of the stable at the farther side of
the inn beyond their range ot vision
a window on the ground floor had been
left open to admit the night air

  suddenly from out of this window
issued a cry which not only aroused the
sentinels but half the sleeping inhabi-
tants of the town of chaleo this cry
was repeated so piercing was it that
many who heard it began to cross them-
selves a great commotion in the
tavern arose and several lights flashed
out

  the officer whom perote had accom-
panied a half days journey northward
ran against the landlord in the hallway

   in gods name what was that  he
asked in a trembling voice

   it is only god who knows senor
answered the landlord in a frightened
tone  but it came from the room oc-
cupied by the senor who accompanied
you

  without waiting to ask further ques-
tions the mexican cavalry officer rushed
to the door of captain amadors room

  it was locked but groans sounded be-
hind the panels the officer waited a
second then put his knee against the
door and burst it open

  while such things were occurring in
the house the figure of a man dropped
lightly from the sill of the open window
to the ground and glided away in the
darkness

  having gone a safe distance the man
stopped and began deliberately to clean
a knife by thrusting the blade repeat-
edly into the ground

  when tliis was accomplished to his
satisfaction and he had returned the
weapon to his belt he looked up so the
faint light of the moon fell upon his
fai-e the face was crossed and re-
crossed by white bandages and below

the bandages the mans lips were smiling
horri bly

  it was senor perote

chapter v

the man with the double scar

  the general pushed aside the map he
was studying and turning upon his
camp-stool nodded to the young officer
behind whom the tent flap had just
fallen

  what he saw was six feet of brawn
and muscle a pair of broad shoulders
surmounted by a sober clean-cut face
bronzed almost to the coppery hue of an
indian

   a splendid type of the virginian
gentleman commented the general
mentally then

   i have called you lieutenant ilad-
don on a case of identification the
identification of a mexican who claims
to possess your friendship

  a look of perplexity flashed across the
young officers face

   i have had occasion to meet a good
many mexicans since coming south sir
but as for friendship with any of them
that is another question said he
quietly

   however the man insists an-
swered the general k and there was
nothing to do but to confront him with
you a short time ago he walked de-
liberately into the lines and when
stopped by the guard demanded to be
taken to lieutenant haddon of har-
neys horse a most unprepossessing
rogue i can assure you sir but the re-
quest being an unusual one i have
ordered him held in readiness to meet
you here

  he struck sharply upon the table and
an orderly appeared in the tent opening
to whom the commander gave the order
that the prisoner be brought again be-
fore him

  during the moments which followed
and during which he waited for the ap-
pearance of the man who had given his
name to the guard a clearer inkling of
the matter came to the virginian the
remembrance of that wild nights ride
irorn the little mexican inn on the high-
road to chaleo
the eleventh rider



  he was not therefore surprised when
he saw before him a face so horribly dis-
figured by two livid scars that he in-
voluntarily shuddered

  the newcomer advanced boldly into
the tent hesitated for a moment
glanced from the elder officer at the
table to the younger and the light of
recognition flashed into his deep-set
eyes

   it is the senor lieutenant you have
not forgotten   said he rapidly in
spanish

  no answered haddon i re-
member the-the-

   the scars the mexican filled out
the sentence  the senor remembers
what he saw that night in the light of
the burning taper i am perote who
kept the inn on the chaleo road

  lieutenant haddon turned to gen-
eral taylor

   this man is indeed known to me
for it was by his aid  escaped from the
squad of mexican cavalry by whom 
was taken six weeks ago

  and he explained rapidly just what
had occurred on the night when senor
perote had assisted him down a ladder
and afterward set fire to his own prop-
erty

  when he had concluded the general
nodded gravely

   i see said he  and now the man
has come to claim your promise if he
can explain satisfactorily his presence
in our lines and for what purpose he
came hither he will no longer be held
as a prisoner

  haddon turned to the ex-innkeeper

   the general wishes to know what
has brought you here senor for what
purpose you have entered our lines  he
asked

  a cold smile crossed the firm lips of
the mexican

   it would take many words to ex-
plain all senor and it touches not the
matter but my purpose in coming here
is to befriend the american invader is
not that sufficient for your general
said he quietly

   and in what manner you are a
mexican and most mexicans are loyal
replied the virginian

  the smile which distorted senor
perotes face was not a pleasant one

   let the senor rather say i was a
mexican and none more loyal to the
republic than i but now-the seiiors
can see what mexico has done for me
it cannot be hidden

  the lieutenant glanced at the two
livid scars forming the bars of a cross
upon the mans visage lie turned once
more to the american commander

  it is plain sir that his disfigure-
ment-not many weeks old for the
wounds were fresh when i saw them
at the inn-has been given him by his
own countrymen it is hatred and
desire for revenge which has brought
him here

   two powerful motives when pos-
sessed by a determined man tell him
to speak out taylor replied

  senor perote came closer to the table
and his eyes rested upon the map of
mexico

   it has pleased the seiior general to
push into many parts of my country
even as a spider throws out his web from
a common center two days ago a force
of two hundred mounted men were de-
spatched to the pass of el yidio un-
less rescued their doom is certain
three thousand of santa annas sol-
diers are marching to surround them
it will be another alamo

  haddon translated rapidly a look of
alarm crossed the generals face

  major smith and his party they
were to hold the pass until it was de-
cided whether we should push forward
that way or by a more direct route
southward

  it is fifty miles from the pass to
santa annas main line and he is send-
ing three thousand men a march of fifty
miles across the mountains to capture
two hundred if such a force fall upon
the detachment unawares it will indeed
be the alamo repeated

  he paused for a moment then con-
tinued sharply

   ask him lieutenant why if lie de-
sires to save the detachment from the
mexicans he did not ride straight to the
pass and warn them instead of coming
here

  senor perote passed one hand softly
across his chin

   to cross the mountains the shortest
route to el vidio one must go on foot


the argosy

and i am not over fond of walking
senor

    then there is another reason the
americans at the pass would not run
from their position at the word of a
mexican they would remain and
fortify themselves and the result would
be the same for santa anna is de-
termined and will send two small can-
non

   then the soldiers have not yet
started asked hadden quickly

   it was to be to-morrow morning
and they will travel slowly you see
santa anna understands the method of
the americans such ones are com-
manded to hold the pass he can take a
reasonable time they will be there
when his men arrive

  a grim smile crossed the generals
lips

   it is gods truth said he  smith
will not budge short of an order direct
from headquarters i fancied the guer-
rilleros might trouble him considerably
but a force of three thousand men-he
must vacate the pass lieutenant
then drawing the open map before
him

   ask him how long will be required
for the mexicans to reach el vidio and
the shorted direct route across the
mountains from here thither

   it will take the soldiers two days
perhaps a little more in thirty-two
hours one might beach the pass from
this place-if he knew the wav over the
mountains answered perote

  the virginians eyes were dancing
but he spoke very quietly

   might i request to be detailed to
carry your order to major smith and
perhaps this man will act as a guide
across the mountains  

  general taylor seemed to hesitate
-under ordinary conditions  would
grant your request most willingly but
-i have already outlined another duty
an imperative errand for you lieuten-
ant rut if this fellow wiil consent to
guide a courier to the pass tell him he
v ill be amply rewarded

  it was my purpose to ask you to
p-company me across the mountains to
el vidio senor but other duties will
hold me here would tou however
guide one who goes to warn my country-

men asked haddon turning to the
mexican

  perote nodded grimly

  else i did so my time has been
wasted for if any one went by the
longer and known way he would arrive
at el vidio behind santa annas sol-
diers

   the fellow is terribly in earnest to
injure santa anna and we can do no

  g than trust him see that he is pro-
vided for and return in half an hour
lieutenant said general taylor when
haddon had translated the ex-
innkeepers answer

  the virginian led perote to his own
quarters

you will eat and rest here until
general taylor demands your presence
senor if there is anything you want
tell me said he

  perote rolled a cigarette

   nothing but a little sleep for i
have not closed my eyes for forty-eight
hours the scuor has but to touch me
and i will be read the man spoke
quietly

  twenty minutes later stretched upon
haddons cot his scarred face hidden
by his arm he was sleeping soundly

  at the end of half an hour the lieu-
tenant presented himself for the sec-
ond time that afternoon at head-
quarters general taylor greeted him
gravely

   lieutenant said he  i am in-
formed by colonel harney that you are
familiar with the country to the south
and i know you converse freely in the
spanish language it has also come
under my personal observation that you
iie a man of tried coolness and courage
in the face of danger this has been con-
firmed by your immediate superiors

  haddons face reddened under its
coating of tan the commander con-
tinued quietly

     have not however called you here
to pass compliments but for n more se-
rious purpose a vital movement is in
contemplation and-we do not care to
take a step in the dark

  it is imperative that a man of
known coolness and bravery be selected
to dispel this darkness will you under-
take to penetrate into the enemys
country m the character of a spy
the eleventh rider



  haddon fully comprehended the se-
riousness of the task he was asked to
undertake that the danger was in a
degree lessened by his perfect familiar-
ity with the language of the enemy
only increased the chance of a safe re-
turn to the american lines

  at the best this chance was oue
which few men would care to undertake
for the territory into which he must go
was alive with keen-eyed mexicans
rendered desperate and doubly blood-
thirsty by the reverses of the past
weeks

  between the generals question and
the answer however scarcely a second
elapsed the reply brought a nod of
approval from the commander of the
american forces of the rio grande

  he pointed to a stool on the opposite
side of the table and smoothed out the
surface of the map before him

  for a number of minutes lieutenant
haddon followed the faint tracings
which marked the territory he was
expected to explore the blanks it was
desired he should fill in with detailed in-
formation the exact lay of the landeach
valley and hill the roads bridges old-
fashioned stone forts and more modern
earth-works behind which the mexicans
might hope to oppose the advance upon
their capital

  so much he had expected to accom-
plish but general taylor folding the
map turned suddenly to him with an
unexpected question

  that will be your first duty but
there is a second and one no less im-
perative you have heard of the
guerrilla mazatlan lieutenant

  who in the american lines or in all
mexico for that matter hadnot the
most cold-blooded of the mexican free
lances a human fiend renowned for his
cruelty recklessness and diabolical cun-
ning

  general taylor leaned forward across
the table

   we have reason to believe lieuten-
ant said he gravely  that this man
does not confine himself to leading his
followers against our forces it has
been reported that time and time again
he has penetrated our lines gathered
information and returned unmolested
by some it is believed that he is an

american in the service of mexico and
has thus been enabled to move freely
among us i however believe him to be
a native mexican

  the name mazatlan tells us noth-
ing for it is that of a town lying be-
tween us and the capital and has doubt-
less been assumed for campaign pur-
poses what this man is like whether
american or mexican is what we desire
to know if his identity can be estab-
lished the chance of detection when in
our lines is highly favorable

   at present such detection is prac-
tically impossible because no one
among us has knowingly met the man
face to face those of our countrymen
who have had this opportunity through
falling into- his hands have been
hanged or shot within the hour ma-
zatlan takas no prisoners 

  the general paused and the lines
upon his homely face grew stern

   i want you to discover the identity
of this man lieutenant haddon if
possible lure him away from his own
lines or follow him into ours the
method he employs is not warfare but
murder pure and simple i desire his
capturenot only as a dangerous spybut
as the assassin of those of our country-
men wlio have been unfortunate enough
to fall into his hands

  haddon remained silent general
taylor continued

  the task which i would impose
upon you is no easy one possibly far
more dangerous than the other bring-
ing in information of the enemys
forces i want you to understand
clearly that it will not appear as a de-
sire to shirk danger if you do not volun-
teer to undertake the discovery of ma-
zatlan but above all i want you to
understand that if you do attempt to
unearth this man you will walk with a
noose about your neck

  he paused haddons face was grave
and his steel-blue eyes fixed upon the
map spread out on the table suddenly
he raised his head

   i understand clearly sir and ac-
cept the service said he quietly

   very good  answered the general
heartily  you will start shortly after
dark to-night and  desire that you
select one man to accompany you i


the argosy

leave this selection to yon though i
should recommend a texan when you
have reached a decision send the man to
me

  when the flap of the tent dropped be-
hind him haddon walked slowly to his
own quarters his mind busy with the
first details of the task before him

  on two occasions he had entered the
medean lines but only a short distance
and the last attempt had resulted in his
capture and subsequent rescue by senor
perote

  lie did not try to disguise from him-
self the desperate nature of the under-
taking which now lay before him not
only was he called upon to enter the
enemys lines but to go if necessary
into the very capital of mexico itself

  and to carry out the identification of
the guerriuero mazatlan he must min-
gle on familiar terms with the mexicans
themselves

  his safeguards lay in three things
his personal appearance which resem-
bled that of certain mountain inhabi-
tants of the southern republic his fa-
miliarity with the spanish language
and his utter freedom from nerves when
placed iu a difficult position

  for several minutes after entering
his tent he stood still running over in
his mind the men from whom he must
choose one to act as his companion
this companion must share with him
the requisites he himself possessed for
the task in hand and there were several
such among the american forces

  he would have preferred to go alone
but the commanders expressed desire
that he take a companion was tanta-
mount to a command

  doubtless the task of cornering ma-
zatlan would become easier with two de-
termined men working together

  suddenly his meditations were inter-
rupted by the appearance of an orderly
in the tent opening the soldier bore a
message from general tavior that
senor perotes presence was required at
headquarters

  haddon crossed over to the cot and
touched the mexican lightly on the
shoulder the ex-innkeeper started
violently his hand went to his bolt
then he sat upright and got upon his
feet

   the senor lieutenant has awakened

mo said he quietly

  haddon explained the generals

order

  perote smoothed down his matted
hair and tightened the sash about his
waist

  i am ready but it is a sorrow that
another beside the senor is to follow
me through the mountains perhaps it
is because i know the senor to be a
brave man said he

  haddon shrugged his shoulders

   i remember when the cavalrymen
rode up to the inn on the chaleo road
a detail of ten men and another-the
eleventh rider-weak from lack of food
and with his hands bound behind his
back it was then i saw an opportunity
to strike the first blow against those who
have injured me

   and this is to be the second-the
journey to el yidio  replied haddon
feeling he should say something

   not the second for the opportunity
came to me to settle the account with
the worst of my enemies and-i did not
fail replied perote grimly

  the thought flashed through the lieu-
tenants mind that he should not like to
have this man with his terrible face and
piercing eyes for a bitter enemy senor
perote looked capable of drinking the
cup of revenge to the very dregs

  the mexican joined the orderly wait-
ing outside the tent

    adios senor said he quietly and
disappeared

  five minutes later haddon called to a
soldier who was passing

  vou belong to the third texas
lie asked

   the soldier replied in the affirmative
 ask sergeant bradley to come here
at once official business said haddon
shortly

chapter vi

the shadow of a chance

   the summit of a hill which over-
looked the acapulco road one of a pair
ot lust-begrimed horsemen straight-
ened m his saddle and peered through

at his feet enshrouded the valley
the faint glimmer of a thousand little
the eleventh rider



tires twinkled in the distance the
horseman turned to his companion

   yonder are the mexicans-in front
-and the lord knows how many are in
our rear said he grimly

  then pointing to the south

   if it were lighter you could see the
range behind which lies casa mata and
the line of forts stretching to chapulte-
pec itself on otir right just down in
the valley there lies chaleo the old
chaleo and you see the mexicans are
there straight enough we are in the
middle of a first-class hornets nest
the speaker peered through the
gloom out of a pairof steel-blue eyes

  save for their color denoting saxon
origin he might well have been taken
for a descendant of the old race of the
montezumas in whose veins flowed a
tinge of spanish blood

  his companiona smalldark-featured
man with eyes of piercing blackness
shifted his posture in the saddle

   i reckon it would be a hornets nest
if they knew we were up here said he
dryly but now that we are here what
are we going to do next if chaleo is
filled with mexican regulars and cut-
throat guerrilleros i cant see-

   were going down into chaleo-
first thats what we came for the
man we want wont come up here thats
certain answered haddon calmly

  sergeant bradley of the third
texas wiped the dust from the pommel
of his saddle

   all right said he grimly  its
chaleo or el molino and chapultepec
itself if you say so the general warned
me what to expect if i came with you
into this god-forsaken country but i
confess i didnt figure on riding pell
mell into a town filled with mexicans
lieutenant haddon smiled faintly
he knew that if he gave the word the
little man at his side would spur his
horse madly through the main street of
chaleo itself trusting to luck and pure
dare-deviltry to come out safely on the
farther side

  he gathered up the reins

   were from up there near the
american lines scouting you know
said he

   i guess ive learned my lesson an-
swered his companion lightly  after

a good ten days in this infernal country
cut loose from ones base of supplies
and with a noose hanging ready from
every tree im not apt to be rash not
by a long sight lieutenant

   there  said haddon sharply
 cant you remember man it isnt
 lieutenant  this side of the outposts
such a break might cause us the devil
of a row

   these mexicans are quick when it
comes to suspecting every newcomer
they march slow god knows and take
their time when it comes to fighting else
we wouldnt have so easy a time of it
but let them suspect that something is
wrong and theyre on edge in a minute
dont make that break when we get
down there we havent come here to
fight

  he touched his horse lightly with the
spur and began the descent of the hill
for a quarter of an hour the two men
rode in silence for each minute was
weighted with grave consequence sud-
denly-sergeant bradley uttered a sharp
exclamation

   look there lieu--senor over to the
left and coming this way

  haddon pulled up his horse with a
jerk

   a detachment ten to our one-
probably a scouting party he mut-
tered

   looks like it and coming straight
for this road replied bradley then
glancing toward the bushes on the
right

   shall we cut for it theres time-

 no said haddon decidedly
 well meet them half-way

  he touched his horse sharply and
rode straight toward the advancing
horsemen who being on lower ground
had not as yet discovered the presence
of the two riders in the narrow road

  each party advancing at a gentle gal-
lop narrowed the distance between them
rapidly

  suddenly the leaders of the mexicans
pulled up sharply

 haddon threw a comprehensive
glance at his companion

   put that up  he whispered sharply
 those devils can see like bats after
dusk and there would be a dozen ear-
bines covering us in another second
drop your hand and stop scowling your
head off

  bradley uttered a surly grunt but the
hand which grasped the pistol butt tell
to his side allowing their mounts free
rein the two rode straight toward the
waiting mexicans

  it was not until scarcely a hundred
feet separated them that haddon drew
rein

   good-evening sehors the night
promises finely said he pleasantly

  the mexicans scowled from under
their heavily braided sombreros

  whence come you senor asked
one sharply

  from the direction of the rio
grande answered haddon carelessly

  you will ride closer we have
orders to arrest all those who are
riding alone after nightfall and cannot
satisfactorily explain their business
said the mexican tersely

   things were not so bad two weeks
ago at that time one might ride freely
within the lines ventured haddon

   but this is not two weeks ago i
demand to know who you are

   we are of general valencias com-
mand on special duty replied haddon
promptly

  have you any papers last night
a man stopped two miles nearer chaleo
claimed to be straight from the senor
colonel moliero he is now a prisoner
and will die at sunrise

  during this short and sinister speech
naddon was fumbling in the breast of
his loose mexican jacket after a few
seconds he produced a folded paper and
extended his hand

  the mexican advanced a few paces
and took the document holding it close
to his eyes in the fading light

  after a time he looked up

   this seems regular i see you are
special scouts senor you are going to
chaleo

  he spoke in a changed tone

   for to-night only after which we
mn-t push on to the capital in truth
we need some rest having ridden for
twenty hours

  then you must have been close to
tbi- enemys lines did you learn any-
thing	j

argosy

   among other things that the
 americans arc undecided i hey would
 push forward but are uncertain as to
 which road to take

    haddon began to roll idly a cigarette
  then he added carelessly

     they are sending out scouting par-
  ties we narrowly escaped capture by

  one of them

    so   said the mexican dryly
  well such ones will be gobbled up
 before they have ridden far this way
 mazatlan will see to that

   then mazatlan is in the north
 haddon asked the question with well-
 assumed carelessness

     he was five miles south of chaleo
  this morning but while the americans
  are riding one mile he will go five and
  strike quickly you can depend on
  mazatlan senor those scouting par-
  ties will be eaten one by one

     let us trust so for the americans
  are dreadfully in earnest perhaps we
  shall even meet mazatlan as he rides
  northward  

   the mexican officer shrugged his
 shoulders

     who ran tell   said he  but if
  you do best stick that paper on a lance
  with valencias name uppermost
  mazatlan kills first and examines into
  things afterward now if he had taken
  the iniii of whom i spoke we should not
  have the pleasure of seeing him die at
  sunrise at the edge of a half-circle
  haddon hesitated for the briefest sec-
  ond then asked

    the man of whom you were speak-
 ing-i had quite forgotten about him
 is he then a spy  

    the mexican was tightening his rein
   it would appear so though he can-
  not be made to open his mouth it is
  sufficient he was taken riding through
  our army and-a little scrubbing made
  bis face whiter those who stain their
  skin do so for a purpose senor

    we will tarry at chaleo until after
  sunrise for such a sight is worth seeing
  the follow is confined securely ven-
  tured haddon

   have no fear of that the old stone
  house in the center of the town is strong
  enough to make a good fortress
  haddon saluted gravely and pulled
  ins horse to one side the mexican
the eleventh rider



touchod his own upon the flank and
with a jingling of spurs and sabers the
detachment of a score of men resumed
their course northward

  they were well out of earshot when
haddon turned and looked at his com-
panion

   a close shave said lie tersely

  sergeant bradley shifted his posi-
tion

   so close i have been fingering the
trigger for the past ten minutes
when we knocked that yellow-belly on
the head last night and relieved him of
his papers  didnt figure just how and
when we were going to use them  and-
and-by god sir youve got nerve

  a faint smile touched the lieuten-
ants lips then they suddenly set in a
hard line

   the possession of the paper was
triply fortunate said he gravely

   in getting us out of the devil of a

scrape and- his companion

paused

   in locating mazatlan and-in fur-
nishing us with the information that a
spy from our lines is confined in chaleo
and is to die to-morrow morning fin-
ished haddon

  a bitter look crossed his companions
face

   i have been thinking of that god
grant there were more of us or the
mexicans were fewer if it were possi-
ble-

   all things are possible interrupted
haddon soberly  one cannot tell
until he tries

  his companion looked at him sharply

   surely you do not mean - in the
midst of twenty thousand mexicans-
you arc not thinking of- he de-
manded in amazement

  of saving that man from death
yes it is of just that i am thinking
you have been in tight places bradley
you wore in the alamo and--you are
here answered haddon soberly

  the veteran soldier shook his head

   yes said he fiercely  i was with
those who defended the alamo against
santa anna and his cut-throats i was
there when crockett and every mothers
son fell fighting-when the mexicans
wiped us out with a rain of bullets

   but this is different desperately

wounded  tumbled to the bottom of a
dry well and if they saw me there they
thought me dead and left me to rot in
an open grave that was one thing
but to take a man from the hands of
twenty thousand mexican soldiers  

  lieutenant haddon louked sharply
into the swarthy face near his own

    i have never known you to hesitate

-you who hate the mexicans- he

began

   sergeant bradley flushed hotly

    nor do i now sir if there was the
shadow of a chance i would ride straight
into that town through those howling
devils and get that man or die with him
but its the chance i cant see show me
the chance and ill ride into hell behind
you and take him out

  haddon laid his hand upon the
speakers shoulder

    so i thought said he calmly and
im going to find that chance it is our
duty to obey general taylors orders
and obtain the information he desires
but our first duty is to attempt the
rescue of our countryman who i to be
shot at sunrise if we fail so much the
worse but-were going to trv brad-
ley

  a flash of admiration crossed the
texans face

    very good sir said he curtly and
following haddons example drew taut
the reins

   the way into chaleo lav over one of
the many broad roads which traversed
mexico in that section of the country
except for meeting bands of wandering
horsemen such as they had just parted
from there was little or no danger of
the two americans being held up and
examined

   so far had they penetrated into mex-
ican territory and into the midst of the
army of santa anna

   the lines of this armv stretched for
miles east and west a goodlv number
lay farther to the north and had been
safely passed the larger body was en-
camped farther south covering the
strong forts at el molino chapultepee
and the massive stone entrenchments
of casa mata

   general santa anna had arranged his
forces in three parallels it was the
second which haddon and his compan-


the argosy

ion were approaching in order to enter
chaleo the pivot of the second par-
allel

  presently they passed a group of
campfires around which a brawling
company of infantry were eating supper
no one paid the slightest atten-
tion to them horsemen were con-
stantly passing over the road and the
soldiers had become used to the sound
of hoof-beats

  as the town grew nearer these
groups of campfires increased-some
quite close to the road but the majority
a little distance back in the fields once
there was a clatter of hoofs to the
right and the americans hearts beat
more rapidly for they expected nothing
less than to be surrounded by another
detachment of cavalry

  it was only however a bunch of rider-
less horses being driven to water at a
creek on the farther side of the road
the half-dozen soldiers who were ful-
filling this duty were smoking and
laughing boisterously one swore
roundly as the first of the horses shied
at the two riders but nothing more
serious happened

  perhaps two miles from chaleo the
highroad swept in a great curve between
two ranges of low hills this part of
the wav for three hundred yards or so
was quite deserted and moreover
gloomy by reason of the failing light

  not a sound except the noise made
by the horses feet upon the roadbed
and such tumult as came from the dis-
tant campfires broke the silence of the
early night

  haddon aroused himself from the
lethargy into which he had fallen since
his last words with his companion all
his mental energies had been concen-
trated in seeking for some plan which
promised even a chance of success in
liberating the condemned prisoner

   if i am not mistaken we shall reach
the town presently and from this point
on the groups of fires and soldiers will
become more numerous

  as he was speaking something gaunt
and black loomed up suddenly beside the
highway it was a gigantic cross such
as are frequently found along the public
roads in catholic countries

  haddon pulled up his horse so sud-

denly that the animal almost rose upon
its haunches at the foot of the cross
a dark shape was stretched upon the
ground

  the virginian bent down and exam-
ined more closely what this thing might
be when he straightened himself in
the saddle he made a quick and compre-
hensive gesture to his companion

  the silent form upon the ground at
the base of the cross avas the body of a
mexican priest clad in the loose brown
robe of his order

chapter vii

to die at sunrise

  for several moments lieutenant
iladdon and the texan gazed down upon
the man at the foot of the cross then
the former slid gently from his saddle

  approaching noiselessly the figure
of the priest he bent over him re-
mained motionless for several seconds
then returned quietly to his companion

   the man is not dead but sleeping
soundly said he in a whisper

  the texan nodded he was waiting
for haddon to resume the saddle

  dismount quietly whispered the
lieutenant

  sergeant bradley obeyed without
hesitation though it was plain lie felt
surprise

  haddon led him a little way across
the road

   fortune is certainly kind to us to-
night but we must work carefully and
take no risks i think i can see a waj
said he gravely

   to rescue the prisoner   asked
bradley bluntly

     es it is a desperate chance at the
best but one must take desperate
chances under such conditions our
first care must be to prevent the priest
from making an outcry when he
awakes

  the priest  are you going to
question him  

   xo  but through him it may be pos-
sible to rescue the prisoner or at least to
effect his escape from the stone house
m chaleo

   it is an old trick but frequently old
tricks arc the best explained haddon
the eleventh rider



 if we hope to assist the man impris-
oned over yonder the first essential is to
gain access to him he must under-
stand that friends are at work in
chaleo

   you propose to send the priest in

to him with a message- but the

fellow is a mexican

   the priest over there will not enter
chaleo to-night yet he may be the
means of furthering our purpose we
are going to borrow that brown cassock
for a few hours bradley

  a look of comprehension filled the
texans face he understood what his
companion proposed doing to enter the
stone house in chaleo in the guise of a
priest and thus obtain an interview writh
the condemned prisoner it was indeed
an old trick and a risky one haddon
continued quietly

   it will be necessary to bind the man
and leave him hidden among the hills
there is no time to be lost for he may
awake at any moment

  sergeant bradley nodded silently and
turned toward the cross as he re-
erossed the road he removed from about
his neck the big mexican handkerchief
which formed a part of his costume

  watch the horsessir they may take
fright easily he said briefly

  haddon standing at the steeds
heads saw him approach the cross cau-
tiously lie had folded the handker-
chief into the form of a bandage the
ends of which he held in either hand
for a moment he stood above the form
of the sleeping man then his slight
figure silhouetted against the leaden
sky disappeared

  perhaps ten seconds passed then
the voice of the texan came from the
ground at the foot of the cross

   ive closed his mouth sir and hes
waking up

  haddon crossed quickly over to the
pot where bradley kneeling on the
ground was holding down the robed
figure which was struggling desperately
to rise

  over the mans mouth was drawn
tightly the handkerchief effectively
gagging him but it was only too evident
he still retained the free use of his arms
and legs

  the texan with his hands pressed

tightly against the captives chest
looked up

   thrashing like a windmill sir but
be can t make a noise worth speaking of
shall i strip him

  he spoke in spanish and the priest
understood his struggles increased
bradley muttered a short oath and
pressed him harder against the ground

   i might choke him into- he

jerked out

  no said haddon a little argu-
ment may do as well

  he addressed the priest in spanish

   keep quiet and no harm will hap-
pen to you in any case you see it is
useless to struggle

  the captive made a final effort then
a string of incoherent words forced
themselves from under the tightly
bound handkerchief

   we will let you up but dont at-
tempt to run away you understand
said haddon sternly

  the texan released his hold of the
priest and the latter clambered slowly
to his feet he was a small man with
a lean hungry face and piercing eyes

  for a moment standing with his back
to the cross he looked from one to the
other of his captors but except for their
general appearance he could discern
little

  the darkness had increased and the
americans had taken the precaution to
pull their wide-brimmed hats well over
their eyes it was plain however the
man wras trying to examine their fea-
tures

   you would ask who we are and
why we have shown you a priest vio-
lence said haddon gruffly  to the
first i might answer that we are gner-
rilleros as you doubtless surmise sec-
ondly we desire to borrow something
from you

  the man made an expressive gesture
denoting that he carried nothing of
value upon his person

  you will remove your cassock or-
dered haddon sternly

  the priest stood motionless

  the virginian plunged his hands into
the folds of his sash and drew out a
short-bladed knife the priest looked
at the keen weapon and shivered then
by a sudden quick motion he divested


the argosy

himself of the brown robe and permit-
ted it to fall upon the ground at his
feet

  haddon controlled an emotion of sur-
prise

  under the brown cassock the man
wore about his waist a sash and from
the latter protruded the handle of a
pistol he glanced at the texan

   even the priests go armed said he

 bradley shrugged his shoulder
reached forward and took the pistol
from the sash

   what now sir   he asked

   it is necessary we bind him else he
would make straight for chaleo an-
swered haddon he was thinking
 this man may prove more dangerous
than we had reason to suppose a war-
like churchman is worse than an ordi-
nary soldier

  it was evident that the priest was be-
ginning to become more frightened as
each moment passed he looked wildly
to the right and left

   give me the pistol then remove the
sash and bind his hands said haddon
to the texan

 the latter obeyed quickly his
movements resembled nothing so much
as those of a cat as he worked rapidly
and silently before one could count
thirty the captives hands were firmly
secured behind his back

  having tied the knots to his satisfac-
tion the texan did not wait for further
orders but went quickly to one of the
horses and removed a stout rope which
dangled from the pommel of the saddle
this rope he cut into two pieces and
returned to the already helpless pris-
oner

  with every appearance of the keen-
est satisfaction he secured the priests
ankles with one of the sections of
rope the other he wound about his
body beginning at the knees and ending
around the mans neck

  it seemed an impossibility that the
prisoner could struggle even a little but
should he be able to do so each move-
ment would so tighten the second rope
that he would be in danger of strangling
himself

  having completed his task sergeant
bradley arose with a grunt of satisfac-
tion and glanced sharply about him

  the gloom which had settled over the
surrounding hills rendered all objects
indistinct but presently he seemed sat-
isfied with his observation

   yonder some sixty paces from
where we stand there is a hollow be-
tween two ridges of ground lie will
be safe there for some hours sir said

he briefly

  the priest who could now use only
his eves with freedom tried desperately
to speak the texan stepped closer and
peered into his face

  listen said he gravely it so
happens that i was with those who per-
ished in the alamo it was there i saw
several priests who did not hesitate to
fire on the handful of defenders it was
then i made a resolve

   first to kill santa anna if ever the
opportunity was afforded me and sec-
ondly that a mexican should die-a
mexican for every hour i passed at the
bottom of the well into which i had
fallen

   if when we return in the morning
you have not stirred from the spot
where we shall leave you you may be
spared but if you have moved so much
as a yard i will stick this knife between
your ribs

  for a moment it seemed as if the man
standing bound and gagged at the foot
of the cross would faint he closed
his eyes and swayed so perceptibly that
haddon made a movement to catch him
in his arms

  then the eyes opened slowly and
fixed themselves upon the face of the
scowling texan or rather on so much
of his face as was visible there was
that in these eyes which bordered on
fear unbelief and hatred

  the texan shrugged his shoulders

   let us put him where he may lie
safely until morning for it is time we
were gone sir said he quietly for
the moment he had taken the leadership
into his hands with this brief speech
he surrendered it again to the virgin-
ian

  live minutes later the americans
stood once more beside their horses
the space at the foot of the cross was
vacant and the brown cassock was hid-
den beneath haddons saddle

  sergeant bradley swung himself upon
the eleventh rider



the buck of his horse as haddon re-
sumed his own mount he touched him
upon the arm

   the cassock which we have taken
has ijoi covered the body of a priest to-
night for-hat man is not a priest
though he would pretend to be one at
some time or place i have seen his face
before though when or how i cannot
recall for the present it is enough to
know that he lay beneath that cross for
a purpose-feigning sleep said he
soberly

   in speaking of the alamo you told
him what you are answered haddou
so mewhat impaturn t ly

  the texan shrugged his shoulders

  is it not time we ride into chaleo
sir said he shortly

  as they had reason to hope no one
interposed an objection to their prog-
ress during the remainder of the jour-
ney to the environs of the town hav-
ing passed the outlying buildings the
americans found themselves sur-
rounded by a motley collection com-
posed of foot soldiers and cavalry non-
combatants women children and dogs

  the latter snapped viciously at the
hoofs of the horses but by all others
they were apparently unnoticed hav-
ing taken possession of the town the
army of santa anna moved hither and
thither without discipline certain
guards were posted it is true but these
guards used their authority in brow-
beating the citizens to obtain food and
drink and even money any one who
wore even the semblance of a uniform
was free to go and come as he pleased

  having ridden half the length of one
of the streets haddon pulled up his
horse a citizen bareheaded and
walking slowly was approaching when
he was abreast of the horses the virgin-
ian turned in the saddle

   my friend said he  we have just-
ridden in from the north can you
direct us to an inn where we may fodder
our horses and obtain lodging

  the mexican raised his hands

  mother of god and you ask that
five days ago t was the keeper of an inn
one of the best in chaleo now i am
looking for a place to sleep my rooms
have been seized rny goods taken and
when i protested i received a buffet in

payment the invaders could do no
worse unless they hanged me and iu
that case i should beput out of misery
said he dully

   is it so bad as that we would be
willing to pay for what we received not
much it is true but something

  the mexican brightened wonderfully
and came closer to the horses

   while i have been robbed my
brother has been more fortunate they
have left him a corner of the cellar-
doubtless because the rats refuse to give
up possession

  and where may your brother be
found is it far from here

   scarcely a thousand paces and the
place has its advantages from it one
can almost look into the window of the
room in which is confined the prisoner
who will die at sunrise

  for a commission my brother has
even been permitted to place a box
against a wall of the prison and for a
few coppers any one who chooses to pay
may mount the box and look at the con-
demned spy

   so the prisoner is on exhibition dur-
ing the night at the end of which he is
to die haddon spoke bitterly

   and why not   retorted the mex-
ican  has he not among other
things refused the hoiy offices of a
priest for such a one death is too
easy a punishment

   you are speaking wisely  should
like to look at such a fellow said ilad-
don heartily

   oh that is easy enough there are
many around the stone house each
waiting a turn to mount the box a
word in my brothers ear will however
give you a preference provided i am
paid something

  the virginian took a dozen coppers
from his pocket and dropped them into
the mans eager palm

   lead the way said he

  for a hundred rods then down a nar-
row ill-smelling lane and again into a
broader thoroughfare the americans
followed their guide

  looking some distance ahead they
perceived that the wav was blocked by
a varied crowd whose faces were turned
toward a low two-storied building of
massive gray stone


the argosy

  on the outskirts of this crowd the
mexican halted

    wait said he  i will first find my
brother after which i will return and
hold your horses-for a few extra cop-
pers

  he pushed his way through the crowd
but after the lapse of five minutes re-
turned accompanied by a small man
who was even dirtier than he the new-
comer regarded the horsemen critically

   these are the senors who are willing
to pay something explained the first
mexican

  it is a difficult matter but-

the other hesitated

  haddon produced a silver piece

   perhaps this will make it easier my
friend he said

  the mexican clutched the money bit
it and dropped it into his sash then
bv a gesture he denoted that the horse-
men should dismount and follow him

  haddon and his companion reached
the ground at the same moment the
former turned to the first mexican who
had laid hold of the bridles

   we will go one at a time said he
gruffly and followed the man who had
taken the silver piece leaving the texan
to guard the horses

  had he not done so every inch of the
saddles and what was concealed beneath
one of them would have been examined
as soon as his back was turned

  that part of the street which ran
past the side of the old stone building
was somewhat brilliantly illuminated
by a number of torches following his
guide through the crowd haddon
finally arrived opposite the house aud
within a dozen feet of it

  then he saw that a large box had
been placed directly beneath one of the
windows an opening was cut through
the thick stone wall about eight feet
from the ground across which were
stretched numerous rusty bars the
ends firmly embedded in the masonry

  the mexican whom he had followed
darted forward and seized by the coat
a man who from the top of the box was
peering between the window guards

   come said he sharply  you have
already exceeded the limit and others
are waiting

  lie pulled the fellow roughly from

his perch and motioned to haddon to
climb upon the box the virginian
mounted and peeped between the bars

  what he saw was aroom ot consider-
able size the four sides of which were of
stone against the wall opposite the
window a bench had been placed and
upon this bench was seated a solitary
figure-the prisoner who was to die at

sunrise	

  why the wretched man faced the
opening through which so many curious
and mocking ones were constantly
gazing was explained at a single glance
an iron ring which passed around his
neck was riveted into the wall behind
and so tight was this metal band that
the wearer must face constantly in one
direction

  that the guards were concerned in
the public exhibition of their prisoner
was evinced by a pair of candles set in
sockets in the wall so the light would
fall directly upon the face of the con-
demned

  a spasm of rage flashed through the
body of the virginian and his hand
which grasped one of the iron bars
tightened until particles of rust were
ground into the palm

  though he did not recognize the pris-
oner it was plain to see he was an
american-a mere youth it appeared
who had trusted himself among a pack
of bloodthirsty wolves

  for several moments haddon gazed
silently upon the white face and closed
eyes of the man before him behind
the tumult made by the impatient crowd
drowned all other noise

  the virginian pressed his face closer
against the bars

   count to yourself five thousand at
the end of that time tell the guard that
you desire to see a native priest

  the words uttered in a hoarse whis-
per and in english drifted across the
cell and reached the ears of the prisoner
lie opened his eyes slowly and a slight
convulsion crossed his face it was
evident lie imagined himself to be
dreaming though he knew he had not
been asleep

  haddon made a slight movement with
his hand across the space between the
bars and repeated the words he had
before uttered this time the man
the eleventh rider



before him comprehended for his eyes
opened to their full extent and he nod-
ded ever so little

  five thousand  repeated the vir-
ginian for the third time

  it was necessary that time be given
in which to make his preparations and
except bv counting the prisoner had no
means of reckoning time five min-
utes would seem to him an hour did
he ask too soon that a priest be sent to
him haddon would not be at the stone
house to respond and the only oppor-
tunity would have been thrown away

  the impatient voice of the mexican
sounded behind the virginian

   come senor others are waiting
haddon stepped to the ground
pushed those nearest roughly aside and
elbowed his way through the crowd on
its outskirts sergeant bradley and the
horses were waiting beside the lattex-
tile first mexican was standing

   the senor is satisfied   he asked
yes answered haddon coldly i
have seen sufficient

   and the senors desire to occupy my
brothers cellar 

   begone you fool  said haddon an-
grily  do you then imagine mexican
officers desire to sleep in a cellar

  he made a significant gesture the
citizen of chaleo cast a frightened
glance at the frowning face above him
turned and disappeared

   we have got rid of that fellow  now
it is time to act said haddon sharply
and turned his horses head away from
the direction of the stone house

chapter viii

the iron collar

  the old stone house near the center
of chaleo the old chaleo was divided
into two sections by a narrow hall which
ran completely through the building
on either side of this passageway
opened the rooms on the lower floor of
the building for generations the place
had been used as a prison or something
worse and the condition of the rooms
left much to be desired

  when santa annas army moved
down and occupied chaleo certain of
the officers examined the stone building

with the idea of turning it into a habi-
tation

  the examination made them decide
otherwise it was one thing to fight
the hated invaders from across the rio
grande but quite another to begin hos-
tilities with the rats and vermin which
held the ancient prison with a strong
hand

  so it happened that except for a few
slovenly recruits the house was un-
inhabited these recruits spent their
time wandering about the town rob-
bing and browbeating the citizens
only the guard and the man who was
condemned to die at sunrise occupied
the gray stone building the former
passed his time lolling on the door-
step consuming innumerable cigarettes
there was no fear the pri oner would
walk out and make off  the iron ring in
the wall had done its office too long to
yield to the struggles of one miserable
american

  sufficient it was that once each hour
the mexican soldier opened the door of
the prisoners room and looked in the
man inside was always in the same
position-his back to the wall his ees
closed his white strained face turned
toward the barred window

  it was during one of these hourly
visits to his charge that the guard found
the man looking toward the door
heretofore for hours he had failed to
exhibit any signs of life or interest tle
soldier stood upon the threshold and
stared he removed the cigarette from
between his lips and blew a cloud of
smoke into the ill-smelling room

   perhaps the-the senor desires some
water  

  the soldier was from the south be-
yond the city of mexico he was moun-
tain bred and there was in his heart a
spark of pity yet he spoke almost in
a whisper for it would not do for the
leering crowd outside to know he had
offered the prisoner anything

  the american motioned the man to
come nearer

   i desire only that a priest be sent to
me said he in a faint voice and in
broken spanish

  the mexican stared in amazement

  mother of god muttered he
 and  have sent four away already


the argosy

because this same heretic refused con-
solation of the church

  he produced another cigarette and
lighted it

  you desire a priest said he
doubtfully

   it is so in a few hours the sun will
rise answered the prisoner

  the soldier backed out of the cham-
ber closing the door behind him

   the devil  he muttered  and
can such a one be found in the neigh-
borhood at this hour especially as i
have made it clearly understood the
fellow in there has refused to make his
peace with heaven it would be only
just that he die avith his sins upon his
soul

  yet he resolved to find a priest even
if he had to send one of those without
in search of one coming to the door
he was about to call to a passing citizen
when his eyes fell upon a brown cassock
approaching slowly the foot of the steps

  the churchmans cowl was drawn avell
over his eyes and he seemed to be in
deen meditation but upon reaching the
steps he stopped and looked up it was
no other than lieutenant haddon who
for perhaps a quarter of an hour had
been hovering in the vicinity ol the
stone house

  the guard removed the cigarette from
his mouth

   holy father said he  a miracle
has happened the man who is con-
fined within and who is to die at sunrise
requests spiritual consolation hitherto
he has refused to open his lips

  haddon bent his head gravely

   even at the eleventh hour i will
go to him my son said he quietly and
mounted the steps until he stood beside
the soldier

  the latter lost no time in leading him
through the hall to the door of the pris-
oners chamber when it was opened
and the supposed priest stepped across
the threshold his eyes fell upon the
open window directly opposite the man
fastened to the wall

   it is not fitting that vulgar eyes
gaze upon the confession of a dying
man pin a cloth across the opening
said he sternly

  the guard hurried away and returned
with a ragged blanket which he fast-

ened over the window haddon walked
across the room and deliberately blew
out one of the candles the place was
plunged in semi-darkness

  the mexican slipped quietly out of
the chamber closing the door behind
him haddon waited for a few mo-
ments and having satisfied himself that
the man was not listening approached
the prisoner

   what is to be done must be accom-
plished quickly arc you in any way
crippled he asked in a low voice

  a strange noise escaped the lips of
the man fastened to the wall-a sound
between a laugh and a groan

   except that i fear my neck is
broken i have escaped injury answered
he in a hard voice

   then you will he able to leave this
hole   answered haddon

   if you are strong enough to tear
this cursed ring from the wall the
prisoners voice expressed anything but
hope of liberation

  haddon bent down and examined the
iron collar a glance showed him it
would be impossible for even the strong-
est man to break it

   i have not neglected to provide
myself with what is needed said he
quietly and from under the brown cas-
sock he produced a file

   it so happened that after leaving
the window i ran across the shop of a
blacksmith hold your head quiet and
press to the left i am going to cut
through this iron he explained

  he tested the ring carefully and an
expression of satisfaction crossed his
face the iron was old and rusty and
might with patience be severed had
it been of steel the task would have
presented more difficulties

  suddenly the sound of a low voice
chanting solemnly filled the chamber
 hose without who heard knew it was
the priest repeating the prayers for a
man about to die

 lo haddon and the prisoner the
cnant had another meaning to drown
tin- noise made by the rasping of a tile

  the virginian worked desperately
act carefully the blacksmith from
whose shop he had stolen the file pos-
sessed excellent implements the iron
yielded beyond expectation
the eleventh rider



  after a time haddon stopped re-
placed the tile under his cassock and
seized the collar in both hands a sharp
snap accompanied by a stifled groan
sounded in the room

  the prisoner raised his hand quickly
to his neck and when he withdrew it
his fingers were stained with blood but
the iron collar was broken

  haddon placed his hand under his
companions arm but the prisoner arose
without much effort he swayed
slightly and his head remained rigid
but there seemed to be no cause to fear
he would collapse

   god knows my friend- he be-
gan but haddon checked him

   words are unnecessary i do not
even ask how you came here it is
enough for the present that you tell me
your name i am iladdon of harneys
horse

   and i am anderson of duncans
battery they caught me within four
miles of-

  i know interrupted haddon
sharply  on the acapulco road we
will talk this thing over when we get out
of this hornets nest the thing now
is to get out

  he stepped to the door and listened
then returned to his companion

  the guard is standing outside the
entrance when i knock he will let me
into the passage listen to what i have
to say carefully

   this building is situated at the
angle of two streets the one on which
your window opens is lighted and filled
with people but the other is much nar-
rower dark and practically deserted
when you leave this room turn to the
right and pass straight through the hall
it will bring you to the door opening
into the narrow street it should be an
easy matter for you to slip out and lose
yourself in the darkness for these
mexicans are under wretched discipline
and the streets are not patrolled we
will not leave the house together for i
shall pass out by the front door neither
will it bo wise for us to see each other
anywhere in chaleo having left this
place you must shift for yourself and
escape from this town as quickly as
possible

  then when shall i see you again

        a

you purely do not intend to remain
for long in chaleo they may do to
you as they have done to me and my
disguise was well-nigh perfect

  haddon thought for a moment

   the country between here and our
lines is alive with mexicans and to pass
through them may be difficult unless
you understand the roads there is
some four hours ride from here a de-
serted inn on the acapulco road you
may know the place by three gigantic
boulders which rise to the height of
twenty feet or more on the opposite side
of the road

   as i have said this inn is deserted
make your way thither and if you so
choose remain there for forty-eight
hours if by that time i do not appear
it will be impossible for me to come by
that road and you can continue on
alone

   i know the inn for i slept between
the boulders one night answered an-
derson

   then you need no further direc-
tions  am going to knock on the door
stand a little behind me and when i
leave the room follow quickly and turn
to the right said haddon briefly

  he laid in his companions hand a pis-
tol and short-bladed knife then he
turned and walked to the door

  several moments elapsed between the
tapping upon the panel and the sound
of approaching footsteps in the hall
without then the noise of a bolt being
drawn was heard and the door swung
open

  the guard peered into the darkened
chamber

   well father said he  are you
ready to depart  

  iladdon advanced across the thresh-
old  it was only a step-sufficient to
permit him to gaze up and down the
hall

   a word my son said he softly

  the mexican stepped through the
open door suddenly he saw something
behind the supposed priest-the figure
of a man whose face was in the shadow

  a startled exclamation sprang to his
lips but before it found utterance a
grip which seemed to be that of steel
closed upon his throat so sudden it
was that the breath was driven into his


the argosy

body he raised his hands to loosen the
dreadful pressure upon his windpipe
when a stunning blow on the temple
almost deprived him of consciousness

  he struggled feebly  the blow was re-
peated a quiver passed through his
body and freed from the grasp upon
his throat he sank limply to the floor

  haddon stepped carefully over the
bodv and stopped in the dimlv lighted
hall

   to the right he whispered and the
artilleryman obeyed silently

  the virginian turned closed the door
and bolted it then drawing the cowl
well down over his face he walked to the
front door and passed through it the
greater portion of the crowd in the
srreet had disappeared for the window
of the prisoners chamber having been
covered no further interest attached to
the neighborhood

  haddon passed down the steps and
walked slowly away from the few who
remained gathered under the window
when he had gone some distance his
steps quickened he turned into another
street traversed it rapidly almost ran
through a short alley and came once
more into a broader and dimly lighted
thoroughfare

  he no longer wore the brown cassock
but appeared to be a guerrillero wander-
ing aimlessly about the town

  for a thousand paces or more he
sauntered over the uneven stones
looking straight into the faces of those
he met and once littering a round
spanish oath as a citizen jostled him
after a time he came opposite a building
from the door and windows of which
lights were shining

  this place he entered without cere-
mony and glanced about the low-
ceilinged room this room contained a
number of tables at several of which
men were seated

  haddon crossed over to one of the
tables and sat down opposite the man
who occupied it this man was ser-
geant bradley who was passing his time
in blowing rings of tobacco smoke to-
ward the ceiling

  the texan looked keenly into his
companions face what he read there

told him the plan had been successful

that the prisoner no longer sat facing

the barred window in the stone house of
chaleo

  in the mean time haddon was exam-
ining the other occupants of the room
only one was a soldier already more
than half drunk the others were
swarthy-skinned civilians each intent
upon his own business

  the virginian turned to his com-
panion

   well said he  has anything oc-
curred  

   only that i have nearly fallen
asleepanswered the texan wearily

   and the horses 

   oh they are in a shed yonder
where we may sleep if we desire

  perhaps later but now there is
something to do

   i was beginning to fear i should
take root here responded the texan
dryly  even that soldier over there is
too drunk to enter into an argument

  haddon arose and was turning toward
the door when there was the clatter of
hoofs without the rattle of a saber and
a mexican cavalryman almost hurled
himself through the doorway he
glanced quickly about the room saw
what it contained and addressed had-
don

  i am seeking captain valeno
senor have you seen him to-night he
demanded

   no senor replied haddon  if he
is here i have not-

  the mexican cavalryman uttered an
oath

   i have searched for him in twenty
places for his presence is imperative

i here is the devil to pay at head-
quarters

  and how is that haddon ven-
tured

  the mexican shrugged his shoul-
ders

  and you ask me if you had been
there you would understand well
enough it was only half an hour ago
a detachment returned to the town and
iii its midst was his excellency the
general santa anna

    as god is my witness it is rumored
they found him bound with ropes and
lying helpless near the acapulco road
as to that i do not know clearly but
the commander is in a dreadful passion
the eleventh rider



   he has summoned mazatlan before
him and it is rumored that those who
did the thing were guerrilleros of his
command

  and captain valeno iladdon
could think of nothing else to say

   oh he is wanted too you know
what the general thinks of him if he
should come in here tell him what i
have told you

  in another moment he was through
the door and in the saddle every one
in the room except the drunken soldier
was upon his feet

  haddon turned to his companion but
paused at the expression upon the
texans face

  you heard him whispered ser-
geant bradley hoarsely  there can be
no mistake

   you heard what he said answered
haddon making a gesture of caution
 come we must get out of here to
headquarters

  he was thinking that mazatlan would
be there

  sergeant bradley followed him across
the room and through the door

  what ails you man asked had-
don sharply it appears that it was
santa anna whom we relieved of his
disguise on the road out yonder but
what of that he answered as well as
another

  the texan seemed -struggling to
speak

  you ask me that  he finally
blurted out it was santa anna
himself i held under the point of my
knife and- did not stick it between
his ribs mother of god

  haddon began to quiet him

   we are not murderers said he
 and to kill a defenseless man except
for an imperative reason is murder
but it is not murder to kill a rep-
tile you were not at the alamo
groaned the texan bitterly

  haddon laid his hand on his arm

    come said lie  it is too late to crv
over such matter our business is at
headquarters it is mazatlan we are
after not santa anna

   pardon sir said the other quietly
 hut i was thinking-well you see my
father and two brothers were at the
alamo let us do as you sav and go to

headquarters to get a look at this ma-
zatlan

chapter ix

  the man in the braided jacket

  to find the headquarters of general
santa anna was not difficult the
house in which the dictator of mexico
had established himself stood on the
southern outskirts of chaleo in the
middle of a small plaza

  the building was of stone two-
storied and was surroiinded on all sides
by a wide veranda any one walking
along this veranda could look into a
number of narrow windows opening into
the chambers on the first floor

  iladdon and his companion reached
the outskirts of the plaza without being
stopped or questioned in fact they
were but a part of a considerable crowd
of soldiers and civilians who attracted
by the rumor that something unusual
had occurred desired to be as near head-
quarters as possible

  most of the curious ones stopped at
the edge of the plaza content to gaze
across the open space at the lighted win-
dows but the two americans had no in-
tention of watching from a distance the
forms of the numerous persons who con-
stantly appeared and disappeared be-
tween the lights and the inner fringe of
the crowd

  the question was to be solved how-
ever of how they could safely get nearer
the house the plaza was guarded  any
one attempting to cross it must give a
good reason for so doing before being
permitted to proceed

  the solution of this riddle proved to
he not so difficult as at first appeared

  couriers had been despatched
throughout the town to summon to
headquarters certain officers of the
mexican army from time to time
one or another of these officers appeared
and in most cases was accompanied by
several aides or followers

  these groups pushed their way
through the crowd of curious ones and
the guards recognizing the officers per-
mitted them to pass the course
adopted bv haddon and sergeant brad-
ley was extremely simple the plaza
was plunged in semi-darkness lighted


the argosy

onlv by the myriad stars which shone in
the heavens

  watching their opportunity they
waited until an officer appeared accom-
panied by a considerable following and
when these passed through the crowd
and out on the plaza the two ameri-
cans simply made themselves a part of
the escort

  as such the guards permitted them
to pass this lack of discipline was to
be found throughout the entire mexican
army

  a startling example was given to the
world by an act of general valencia
himself against the explicit orders of
santa anna he had attacked the ameri-
can forces at the outset of a great battle
and through this piece of disobedience
the battle had been lost to the mexicans
forthwith

  having passed the soldiers who
guarded the plaza to approach the
house was an easy matter the senti-
nels who were supposed to patrol the
veranda on all sides of the building
contented themselves with pacing up
and down the front and around the
side corners while the rear was innocent
of scrutiny

  in fact some curious soldiers anxious
to see what was ocetirring inside were
looking through the windows after a
careful survey of prevailing conditions
haddon and the texan lost no time in
mounting the veranda and placing
themselves at a vacant opening there
unmolested they were enabled to get an
excellent view of what was going on
within the headquarters of the com-
manding general

  the room into which they looked was
a spacious chamber lighted by a dozen
candles which revealed the figures of
two men-the one standing with his
back toward the windows the other
pacing restlessly to and fro

  this second man was of small stature
and limped as he walked it was general
santa anna dictator of mexico and the
americans had no difficulty in recogniz-
ing in him the supposed priest they had
robbed of his cassock at the foot of the
cross on the acapulco road

  santa annas dark face was convulsed
with passion his words snapped out
with a peculiar hissing noise were

plainly audible to the watchers at the
window

   and for what reason do you tell ine

it was none of your precious gang of
cut-throats who did thai thing do
vou pretend to sa that you keep track
of the movements of each alter night-
fall  

  he put the question to ins companion
in a voice in which a sneer was predomi-
nant

  the other who stood in a strained
attitude with one hand resting upon the
hilt of his sheathed saber shook his
head emphatically

   i have not said it was impossible
your excellency but i maintain the
thing is improbable my men are de-
voted to the cause and to the person of
your excellency why should they do
violence to- 

   have i not told you i was disguised
that i wore the garb of a monk you
know i frequently find it necessary to
adopt such a method for in that manner
certain things are discovered which
would not otherwise come to my ears

   to-night it happened that i thought
it necessary to visit an outpost on the
acapulco road-because i suspected cer-
tain things in connection with the offi-
cer who commanded it it avas while
i avas returning that i was set upon
gagged bound and threatened

  do you understand my life
threatened by tavo mexican guerrilleros

  santa annas face was white with pas-
sion

  the man whose back was toward the
window moved uneasily

  c but if you saw them plainly surely

it is possible again to recognize-lie

began

  the general broke in savagely

    have i not told you i could not dis-
tinguish their faces the fools were
too smart for that had i done so
every soldier in this army should pass
before me one at a time and when i

came to those two- mother of god

all mexico should see what would hap-
pen  

   to discover them may be quite
possible  ou tell me one was large
the other small perhaps you might
even recognize  heir voices did vou again
hear them
tiie eleventh rider



   it is hardly possible but-

santa anna stopped and ground his heel
into the matting which covered the floor
and then continued in a terrible voice
  might even let the thing pass in
order that it did not become public but
-i was found by some of my own sol-
diers-t their general was found bound
and gagged lying like a log of wood on
the bare ground ten thousand devils
the whole army will know it by morn-

ing 

  he seemed to breathe with difficulty

the texan pressed haddons hand

   something at least was accom-
plished he whispered in a voice of the
keenest satisfaction  there is not a
prouder man in all mexico than santa
anna you see how lie takes it

  the mexican commander began to
roll a cigarette then tore it to pieces
and threw the pieces upon the floor

   you do not say anything cried he
sharply

  what can i say your excellency

if there is anything-

  mother of god and you are ac-
counted the smartest officer in all my
army even those dogs of americanos
tremble when your name is mentioned
i tell you those devils were guerrilleros
and you are the leader of my guerrilleros
when you return to your men listen
listen day and night creep upon them
at ail hours these two will talk to-
gether-some time-then you can strike
as you strike against the americanos
from beyond the rio grande

  what the officer thought of this
proposition was a problem but he re-
plied quietly

   i will follow your excellencys in-
structions if any among my men were
guilty of that thing i will do my best

to find them i will- 

  there came a sudden interruption
from the other side of the room a low
knock sounded upon the panel of the
door leading into the hall santa anna
turned sharply walked to the door and
opened it

  the figure of an orderly appeared in
the aperture

  well cried the general angrily
 why are we interrupted

    have been commanded to report
lo your excellency without losing a mo-

ment-to report to your excellency that
the prisoner confined in the stone house has
made his escape 

  a momentary silence filled the room
santa anna glared at the messenger
like a wild beast of prey

  were my orders not obeyed he
asked in a voice of awful calmness

   that the prisoner be fastened by
the neck to the ring in the wall it was
done your excellency answered the
orderly

   then it is impossible that he should

have escaped unless- santa anna

paused and glared at the officer

   the ring was filed quite through
and broke said the latter in a trem-
bling voice

  you would tell me that this miser-
able prisoner has filed through a band of
iron so easily who has been admitted
to his cell-since sundown

   none save a priest who desired to
administer consolation to a man con-
demned explained the orderly

   a priest who admitted him 

   the guard over the prisoner it
was not commanded a priest should not
visit the chamber

  and this priest-what was he
like  

  the generals face was now impassive
as a mask

   i do not know your excellency the

guard is-

   there are several orders of church-
men in chaleo but even in the dark each
may be known by his habit how was
this one dressed demanded santa
anna fiercely

  the orderly hesitated

   the guard has but just recovered
consciousness but he murmured some-
thing about a brown cassock he re-
plied

  santa anna stood as though rooted
to the floor a look of comprehension
sprang into his face

   mother of god  he cried with sud-
den fierceness  and the cassock which
they took was brown i am surrounded
by traitors even in chaleo 

  the officer who had been standing
with his back to the window and who
had listened silently to the conversation
between the commander and the or-
derly spoke for the first time


the argosy

   it may be possible that your excel-
lency is mistaken it may be possible
that this spy had companions who came
with liiru to chaleo would they not
attempt to rescue their countryman
your excellency  

  a silence followed this startling sug-
gestion an expression of rage and
fear overspread the face of the dictator
of mexico

  it seemed as though he preferred to
think there were traitors in his own
army rather than that certain daring
americans had penetrated his lines and
were at large in chaleo with a power-
ful effort he calmed himself

   that we will discover i place the
matter in your hands senor mazatlan
despatch couriers to even outpost with-
in ten miles of the town search every
house and cellar in chaleo

  the famous guerrilla leader straight-
ened himself and began to hook up his
saber santa anna turned to the wait
ing orderly

   and the guard who permitted the
liberation of the prisoner-where is
he   he asked in a hard voice

 in the care of the surgeons his
head was nearly broken when he opened
the door of the chamber to allow the
priest to depart answered the mexican
 but he is conscious  

   yes your excellency

   then said santa anna in a cold
voice  do not countermand the orders
to the firing squad which is to be at the
public plaza at sunrise

  he crossed over to the table sat
down and wrote an order hurriedly

  take this and give it to the officer
who was to have seen to the execution
of the spy in the morning said lie
handing the paper to the orderly  the
guard who allowed the prisoner to be
taken from his cell shall be executed in
that prisoners place at sunrise

  haddon and the texan looked at each
other

  and you think it would be murder
to kill such a reptile muttered the
latter

  suddenly the virginian smothered an
exclamation of startled surprise and
his companion saw him lean eagerly
forward the texan turned his eyes
again to the window quickly

  the oilicer who was in the room with
santa anna and who wore the richly
braided jacket of a mexican cavalryman
had turned so his face could be seen by
those on the veranda

  the texan drew a sharp breath at
sight of this face for it presented a hor-
rible appearance it was the face of
what had once been a handsome man
but all former comeliness had been de-
stroyed forever

  two livid scars beginning at the mid-
dle of the chin and extending upward
almost to the bottom of the mans ears
framed his countenance as behind two
unsightly red bars

 god in heaven it is senor
perote  muttered haddon hoarsely

  but the texan did not understand

  he saw in the man before him only
mazatlan the famous leader of santa
annas guerrilleros

chapter x

an unexpected interview

  the shock of discovering that the
man whom general santa anna called
mazatlan the man he had entered
chaleo to see was none otfier than the
ex-innkeeper senor perote drove from
haddons mind for the moment all
thought of the peril in which he and his
companion stood

  it is true the guerrilla leader had
turned his face toward the window for
but a few seconds but this brief interval
had been sufficient to reveal the unusual
scars which disfigured it

  it was perote the man who had vol-
untarily entered the american lines for
the purpose of thwarting santa annas
plans who was the famous leader
wanted by general taylor

  a dozen conflicting emotions filled
the virginians mind a riddle pre-
sented itself the solving of which was
doubly difficult wrho was the man
before him 

  a mexican whose heart and soul wore
given to the cause of mexico whose zeal
for the welfare of the southern repub-
lic- led him ruthlessly to slay the in-
vaders from beyond the riogrande
or the mexican who smarting under the
injuries inllicted upon him by certain
the eleventh rider



of his countrymen elected to betray his
country into the hands of a victorious
enemy 

  was mazatlan as perote acting the
spy in the american lines or perote
as mazatlan following the same role in
the army of santa anna  this was
the question which iladdon felt himself
called upon to decide for upon the true
solution hung the course he must pur-
sue

  he felt a pressure upon his arm it
was the texan recalling him from his
reverie

   you have heard all that was said in
there sir chaleo is to be searched from
top to bottom we must act with ex-
treme caution

  the words aroused iladdon to a sense
of the danger which threatened to
walk freely about the streets trusting
that the general confusion would pre-
vent detection was becoming altogether
too risky

  santa anna suspected there were
americans in chaleo and he would
verify this suspicion if possible

   we have seen mazatlan and i
fancy it will not be difficult to describe
him continued sergeant bradley
dryly  ilis entering our lines without
detection is simply impossible

  haddon was thinking how he had en-
tered the lines and in what manner he
had succeeded in walking out again

  then a horrible fear seized him

  had this mexican the man who had
freed him from the upper chamber in
the inn led general taylors messenger
safely across the mountains by the
shortest route to el vidio pass had
he done this and saved the handful of
americans from making a hopeless re-
sistance or had he murdered the mes-
senger cn route and let the defenders of
the pass meet their fate

  an impulse seized him to learn from
this man himself whether he served
mexico or the enemies of the republic-
an impulse which he put away from him
as too reckless for serious contempla-
tion

  if mazatlan was perote there would
be no danger  but if perote was mazat-
lan-to meet him face to face to be
recognized-would mean certain death

  sergeant bradley troubled by none

of these perplexing questions saw only
immediate need of action in the face of
grave danger to him mazatlan was
the merciless mexican guerrillero or-
dered by santa anna to search chaleo
for suspected spies

  no doubt as to his course of action
perplexed him he would avoid this
guerrilla chief as he would the devil but
if necessity compelled a meetiug he
would not hesitate to kill the man with
as little compunction as he would ex-
hibit in grinding under his heel the head
of a rattlesnake

   we have seen mazatlan and now
sir   he asked in a low voice

   first to get away from the vicinity
of this place in which mazatlan will not
remain secondly to follow him an-
swered haddon quietly

  in order that it may become possible
to meet him alone there was a sin-
ister note in the texans question

   we shall see haddon replied
 come there is no time to be lost for
hemay leave headquarters at any mo-
ment

  they were indeed not a moment too
soon for reaching a point where a view
of the front of the house could be ob-
tained the figure of the guerrilla leader
was the first object which met their
eyes

  mazatlan standing in the flood of
light which issued from the open door
was giving certain directions to a mexi-
can sub-officer who stood at attention
on the veranda

  having apparently concluded these
directions the guerrilla descended the
steps and without pausing for an instant
walked rapidly across the plaza toward
the crowd which lined the side of the
square nearest the town

  it was the signal for the americans
to follow

  the crowd parted to permit the
dreaded mazatlan to pass and it had
scarcely closed again before haddon and
the texan began to elbow their way
through the fringe of spectators the
man whom santa anna had ordered to
institute a search into every house and
corner of chaleo proceeded by the
shortest route toward the center of the
town

  after a time his objective point be-


the argosy

came plain to the americans he pro-
posed to visit the old stone prison

  the streets about the old building
were practically deserted a soldier
stood guard upon the steps of the prison
for the order written by santa anna
had been delivered by the orderly and
the luckless mexican who had admitted
the supposed priest to the prisoners
chamber lay in one of the rooms ma-
zatlan spoke sharply to this guard and
passed into the building haddon and
the texan stationed themselves in the
shadow of a house on the opposite side
of the street

  they proposed to be on hand when
the guerrilla leader concluded his visit
of inspection

  a quarter of an hour passed it was
well past midnight and the effect of
their days ride and the strenuous hours
in chaleo were beginning to tell upon
the americans a few hours sleep
would have refreshed them wonderfully
but sleep was out of the question even
for a moment

  suddenly an interruption to their in-
activity came from an unexpected quar-
ter the quiet of the gloomy street
was broken by the sound of approaching
horses

  from the direction of general santa
annas headquarters appeared the
forms of several riders whoapproaching
the stone house at a slow trot pulled up
before the door the first evidently
an officer addressed the guard sharply

  is senor mazatlan in there he
demanded

  the soldier answered in the affirma-
tive the mexican officer dismounted
and entered the building hurriedly in
a few minutes he reappeared accompa-
nied by the guerrilla leader the lat-
ter glanced at the horsemen sitting
motionless in their saddles

   we might ride to my quarters
where we should be in private but that
would take time and you say the mes-
sage is important there is no one on
the farther side of the street let us go
there said he sharply

  it was too late for the americans to
leave their hiding-place without being
seen distinctly by the two mexicans and
the mounted soldiers if they endeav-
ored to escape in either direction the

movement would be followed by a com-
mand to halt and serious consequences
might ensue

  if on the other hand they remained
where they were mazatlan and his com-
panion would see them crouching in the
shadow

  it was just here that the quick wit and
coolness of lieutenant haddon came to
the rescue within a few feet of the
spot where he and the texan were
standing was a depression in the wall
this depression extended a couple of
feet below the surface of the street aud
would afford a possible hiding-place for
a person of small stature the virgin-
ian knew that to attempt to conceal
himself in this place would be out of
the question but sergeant bradley was
a small man

  to meet mazatlan face to face was
what he least desired but to meet him
alone was preferable to having the
mexicans come suddenly upon two men
hiding in the shadow

  he remembered santa anna had told
the guerrilla that one of the men who
had waylaid him upon the acapulco road
was tall while his companion was much
smaller coming suddenly upon such a
combination and under such circum-
stances the guerrilla leaders conclusion
would be obvious

  mazatlan and his companion were
already descending the steps of the old
stone house and what was to be done
must be accomplished quickly haddon
seized the texan by the arm and
pointed to the depression in the wall
sergeant bradley understood and
obeyed without a moments hesitation
he dropped below the surface of the
street into the shallow hollow wrhere
lying flat upon his back lie was
effectually hidden by the darkness

  could any one have pierced this dark-
ness it would have been observed that
the occupant of this shallow grave held
ft cocked pistol in his hand

  mazatlan and the mexican officer
were half-way across the street when
there appeared suddenly before them a
man who stretched himself vigorously
rubbed his eyes and yawned it was
evident that this fellow had been sleep-
ing on the doorstep of the darkened
building opposite
the eleventh rider



  the officer who accompanied mazat-
lan uttered an exclamation but the
guerrilla chief expressed no surprise
lie fixed bis eyes searehinglv upon the
figure which had so unexpectedly arisen
before him

  iladdon advanced a step toward the
men who might the next moment be-
come his captors

   pardon senors said he in a stupid
voice  i fear i have been sleeping

   so it would appear but now that
you are awake it may be possible for you
to answer a few questions answered
mazatlan coldly

  he turned and called sharply to the
guard standing on the steps of the
stone house the soldier disappeared
into the building and returned carrying
a lighted candle in his hand mazatlan
took the taper and held it so the light
fell full upon iiaddons face

  the americans heart was beating
rapidly to any one in chaleo he would
pass for a mexican or to any one who
had not seen him closely under other
circumstances

  but the man who held the candle-
the man he recognized by the disfig-
uring scars-had seen him under other
circumstances a prisoner in the hands
of mexican cavalrymen and as an officer
in the tent of general taylor

  while one might count a score the
guerrilla leader held the candle on a
level with the virginians face his
own was in shadow and haddon could
not read its expression

  mazatlan lowered the light and re-
turned it to the waiting guard haddon
braced himself to hear the words which
might solve the riddle over which he had
pondered on the veranda of santa
annas headquarters

  if the order was given for his arrest
the man whom he had known as seiior
perote would prove his true character
beyond peradventure

  only-and even in that desperate
moment the thought flashed through
the lieutenants mind-he would not be
able to warn general taylor that the
mexican for whom he had vouched was
a cunning spy

  mazatlan look no prisoners

  the guerrilla leader turned to his
companion

   have you ever seen this fine fellow
before he asked calmly

  the mexican officer shook his head

   a company enlisted from the
mountain district south of the capital
reached chaleo this morning and he is
evidently a mountaineer he ventured

  what are you doing here de-
manded mazatlan sharply

  it was evident he accepted his com-
panions suggestion

    was wandering about the town
our quarters are in a deserted stable
which is overcrowded one place is as
good to sleep in as another senor an-
swered iladdon

  mazatlan shrugged his shoulders

   and that is the discipline we find
throughout the army valeno this
fellow should receive a dozen lashes as
a reminder that he belongs with his
company not here in the street he
said harshly

  then turning upon haddon

   go back to your stable the next
time you may not get off so easily to
you hear me  

  the virginian did not wait to hear
the order repeated but having disap-
peared around the nearest corner he
halted abruptly in the shadow of a wall
at which point he could await the de-
parture of the mexicans when sergeant
bradley might rejoin him

  that to follow the movements of ma-
zatlan was necessary he no longer be-
lieved never doubting for an instant
that he had been recognized the subse-
quent action of the guerrilla leader
seemed conclusive proof of his true sen-
timents

  the man was friendly to the ameri-
cans else why had he liberated an
american prisoner from the inn visited
the headquarters of general taylor and
permitted one whom he knew to be a spy
to roam at large through the army of
santa anna

  haddon was however still puzzled
conclusive proof so it seemed to him
had been given that senor perote was
disloyal to mexico but on the other
hand this same perote as the guerrilla
mazatlan had established a reputation
which would scarcely fit his sentiments
of friendliness toward the northern in-
vaders


the argosy

  as perote he betrayed the cause of
mexico as mazatlan he waged relent-
less war against the enemies of mexico
this mystery was still unsolved try as
he might haddon could arrive at no
satisfactory conclusion one thing only
was certain he had met this strange
man face to face and the mexican had
not betrayed by word or look his recog-
nition

   while the virginian was puzzling his
brain over the affair the texan was
huseing the bottom of the shallow de-
pression not five hundred paces away

  he had heard the conversation be-
tween haddon and the mexican and
understood that the former had been
permitted to wralk out of the trap in
his own case however there was much
to be desired lying upon his back in
the uncertain hiding-place no more
than a dozen feet separated him from
the two men standing in the street the
least movement might betray his pres-
ence

   he could shoot one of the mexicans
but the other and the half-dozen men on
horseback would be upon him before the
echo of the shot had died away his
only hope of safety was to lie perfectly
still trusting that the enemy would de-
part without having discovered him

  a minute passed after haddon had
left then mazatlan opened the conver-
sation abruptly

    we are wasting time why have you
ridden so hurriedly from headquarters
to find me  

   i was so ordered by santa anna
there is business for you in the north
replied his companion

   and the order i received not an
hour ago-to look for these american
spies  

    oh you know santa anna is fond of
changing orders we have seen that
before but in this case it is really
something better than digging around
chaleo hunting for one or two mis-
erable spies you may take a dozen or
even twenty of the americans

    is it so but i fancied being the
means of having these spies meet death
on the public plaza still there is as
you say something in killing twenty
instead of two it is a raid toward the
rio grande

   perhaps not so far but it may lead
you there answered mazatlan s com-
panion  you remember that there is
an inn on the acapulco road  

  a protracted silence followed

  when mazatlan answered it was in a

hard voice	

   there arc several inns such as you

mention but what of that

   you know this particular one well

enough

  there was another pause broken only
bv the rattle of a saber then mazat-
lan asked in an impatient voice

   tell me what you have to say i
am to take my men northward what
has that inn to do with it 

   i was coming to that a messen-
ger has just reached headquarters and
reported that certain of the americans
may be found in the vicinity of this inn

a detachment-

   but our lines extend much farther
northward and you would tell me the
americans have ventured within a few
hours ride of chaleo  those are dar-
ing fellows but they cannot do every-
thing mazatlan spoke in a sneering
tone

  his companion uttered a low oath

   it would seem he answered  that
it is possible for these northern devils
to ride where and when they will it is
true many of our men are between this
inn and the american outposts but to
avoid them seems not over difficult

   that however is the business of
santa anna he has sent me to com-
mand you to return at once to head-
quarters when he will himself tell ou
what is to be done i shall accompany
you northward

  mazatlan laughed harshly

   in that case i may be able to show
you something for not one of those
americans will return it has been a
week since my men tasted blood and
you will see how they conduct them-
selves when we have the enemy sur-
rounded

   i can tell you one thing santa
anna is afraid his temper grows worse
each day and his whims arc without
number you heard what happened to
him on the acapulco road

    who in chaleo has not and to
tell the truth f am not sorrv
the eleventh rider



   that is because you hate him and
you are related

  the mexican officer shrugged his
shoulders so violently that his saber
rattled

   you know what he is and what in a
moment of passion he is liable to do
to-night he calls upon you to rid him
of these troublesome americans to-
morrow or the next day he may order
that you be thrust into prison you
hate him as much as i do and for the
same reason

   that will be seen at the proper-
time answered mazatlan but at
present it is our business to fight these
americans when i strike a blow i
think of mexico not santa anna
come we must go to headquarters im-
mediately for i propose to be in the
saddle by sunrise it is three hours of
hard riding to the place of which you
speak

   then you will attack them if you
find them there   asked his companion

   it may be possible or i may permit
them to walk into a trap we shall
see

  the voices ceased and sergeant brad-
ley heard receding footsteps he
raised his head cautiously above the
edge of the shallow depression one of
the cavalrymen who had accompanied
the mexican officer was dismounting
mazatlan vaulted into the empty saddle

  in another moment the little detach-
ment trotted slowly down the street the
soldier who had given up his horse fol-
lowing leisurely only the guard  the
steps of the stone house remained

  the texan crawled cautiously out of
the hole and looked up and down the
deserted street then keeping close
to the wall lie followed the direction
which haddon had taken and which
would bring him to the inn where he
had left the horses

  he had scarcely turned the nearest
corner when he felt a pressure on his
arm it was the virginian who had
stepped out from his hiding-place

  well asked he what has hap-
pened  

   i could have shot this mazatlan
and did not do so answered the texan
dryly  but i shall to-morrow or the
next day

  haddon saw the man had something
to tell him but knowing the texans
peculiarities waited

   the prisoner you liberated from the
stone house will await us at the deserted
inn on the acapulco road-was not that
the understanding asked sergeant
bradley

   for forty-eight hours haddon an-
swered

   then said the texan quietly  no
time is to be lost if we would save him
and perhaps a scouting partv from fall-
ing into the hands of this mazatlan

  as briefly as possible he repeated the
conversation which had taken place be-
tween the two mexicans

  when he had finished a look of de-
termination was visible on haddons
face

   come said he grimly if we start
at once we will reach the inn several
hours in advance of these mexicans

  tile town of chaleo had become
quiet for it was long past midnight and
nearly every one had retired in cer-
tain streets might be found sleepy
guards but except near the headquar-
ters of the dictator they manifested
little vigilance

  haddon and the texan reached the
inn where they had quartered their
horses without being molested the
shed in which the animals stood was on
the opposite side of the street from the
hostelry without troubling them-
selves to arouse the landlord the
americans unfastened the door of the
shed and led out the horses even had
the landlord been awake he would prob-
ably not have dared to question the
actions of two members of santa annas
army

  near the outskirts of the town a sol-
dier stepped into the middle of the road
barring the way and demanded in a
sleepy voice who rode forth at such an
hour

  and you ask such a question
answered haddon sternly  senor
mazatlan is a little way behind you
know how he deals with those who bar
his progress

  the mexican sentinel growled some-
thing under his breath and moved sul-
lenly out of the path it was plain he
did not desire to incur the anger of the


the argosy

dreaded guerrilla leader by interfering
with what he believed to be his advance
guard

  a quarter of an hour later haddon
and the texan were clear of chaleo and
making toward the north on each side
of the highway were the smoldering
campfires and silent forms of hundreds
of santa annas soldiers

  those who stood guard over their
sleeping comrades heard the sound of
horses hoofs upon the road but such
noises by night and day were common
in the neighborhood of chaleo

chapter xi

  the conquering of a dictator

  almost at the very moment when the
two americans riding northward over
the acapulco road were passing the last
group of campfires a startling incident
was taking place some miles in their
rear

  could lieutenant haddon have wit-
nessed what was occurring in a certain
room of a house- on the outskirts of
chaleo the problem with which he was
struggling would have seemed more
intricate and difficult of satisfactory
solution

  in the opinion of the guard sta-
tioned at the door opening between the
veranda and the building itself in which
general santa anna had taken up his
residence an unusual thing had taken
place

   this was the third visit within half a
dozen hours of the same officer it was
well understood throughout the army
that between certain officers and santa
anna no love was wasted and one of
these officers was the guerrilla leader
mazatlan

   it had even been rumored that these
two cordially hated each other but that
the general understanding the value of
the daring cavalryman in annoying the
americans hesitated to deprive himself
of so important an assistant except
upon a direct order however mazatlan
was never seen at headquarters and on
such occasions his visits were as brief
as possible

   the guard detailed to watch the en-
trance which led into santa annas

presence knew that mazatlan had been
summoned after the general s return
from his trying experience on the ata-

 it was also known lliat he had again
visited headquarters in company with
captain valeno an hour later what
was the mexicans surprise therefore
when some time after midnight he was
confronted by the disfigured face ol the

guerrilla 	     

 he felt sure that a third order had
not summoned mazatlan to an inter-
view yet for the third time he passed
through the door which would admit
him into santa annas private apart-
ment

   having passed the sentinel the vis-
itor walked straight to the foot of the
stairs which led up to the second story
of the building and mounted there
quietly

  the sleeping chamber of santa anna
was on the second story and after his
second interview with mazatlan the
general had retired to his room he
was already partially undressed when a
low knocking upon the door brought
an impatient expression to his lips
judging the person without to be an
orderly come with a message of impor-
tance he gave the sharp command to
enter

   the door opened to admit the form of
the unwelcome visitor by the dim
light of the single candle which burned
in the chamber santa anna caught a
glimpse of the scarred face of the in-
truder and a look of surprise crossed
his countenance

   this surprise gave place to blank as-
tonishment and something more when
having entered the room his visitor
closed the door softly and coolly turn-
ing the key in the lock dropped it into
the folds of his sash

   then for the first time he turned and
looked full in the face of the dictator of
mexico

  santa anna started and took a step
toward the table upon which lay his pis-
tols but a stern command uttered in a
cold voice by the man who confronted
him checked the movement abruptly

    stand where you are i have come
to ask a few questions do not lay
your hand upon those firearms
the eleventh iilder



  the dictator of mexico was naturally
a coward at heart and there was some-
thing in the expression written on the
disfigured face before him which para-
lyzed all volition his visitor under-
stood and a horrible smile distorted
his ups

   you will be seated for i would not
keep you standing during our inter-
view said he quietly

  santa anna partially recovered him-
self

   how dare you   he began in a fierce
voice te what is the meaning of this
outrage sir i have but to raise my
voice and-

  the words died in his throat and he
shuddered for he found himself gazing
into the muzzle of a pistol

   you can cry out but you will not
do so for those who might answer that
call would find only your dead body
said the other in a cold voice with
his left hand he motioned tovard an
empty chair

  santa anna sank into it his legs
were trembling and a cold perspiration
covered his forehead

   would you murder me-the savior
of mexico he stammered in a fright-
ened voice

  the other laughed the appearance
of his face as he did so marked as it
was by the two terrible red scars was
horrible to look upon

   that depends upon yourself do
you know why i am here  he asked in
a hard voice

  santa anna felt himself grow hot
and cold by turns but when the pistol
was lowered he regained a little courage

   you have said it was to ask cer-
tain questions if i consent to an-
swer-

   which you will io you know who
t am  interrupted the other in a calm
voice

  santa anna hesitated

   at first  thought-for the light is

poor-i thought- in the name of

all the saints in paradise what-

  the other interrupted coldly

   it is evident that you are becoming
bewildered it is also possible you
may have forgotten certain things no
longer of moment to the man who is
being driven back upon the capital by

the american invaders one of these
things was only a little incident-to
you senor-but-it gave me this

  he touched with the tips of his fin-
gers the two scars which beginning
near the center of his chin extended
upward to the bottom of his ears

  a look of bewilderment came into
santa annas face

  in the name of god and what
had i to do with such a thing do

you think that i-

   gave me the wounds which pro-
duced these scars we are coming to
that presently it is evident the little
incident has escaped your memory

   perhaps you have even forgotten a
certain perote who kept an inn on the
acapulco road well senor i am that
perote and-i have sworn upon the
cross to kill three men

  a look of terror came into santa
annas face and a visible quiver passed
through his body

   the inn on the acapulco road  as
god is my witness i do not understand
what you are saying he stammered

  senor perotes lips twitched ner-
vously it seemed as though a terrific
struggle was going on in his breast

   do not lie to me again senor as
you did on that day else i may forget
that the man i have sworn to kill-the
man who called himself senor urrea
and tricked me into serving drugged
wine to two cavalrymen-is the general
santa anna dictator of mexico said
he in an awful voice

  santa anna opened his mouth to
reply but his tongue seemed paralyzed
senor perote mastered himself by a
powerful effort

   you remember said he coldly
 it was an easy matter to deceive a
simple innkeeper whose heart was loyal
to mexico i permitted you to drug the
wine so the cavalrymen slept for hours
but when they awoke they demanded of
me the papers which you had stolen and
they gave me this-because you had dis-
appeared

  the dictator of mexico passed his
tongue over his parched lips

   as god is my witness i knew noth-
ing of that senor why should you
blame me because they tortured you
he cried hoarsely
the argosy

   had you not lied to me and thus
found opportunity to rob them of cer-
tain papers they would have departed as
they came i found myself lying on the
iloor where they left me for dead do
you know what happened then senor
when i discovered what had been done
to me i swore to have revenge on
the man who called himself senor urrea
on the fiends amador and valeno who
pressed the burning iron into my flesh

   that oath i have in part fulfilled-
perhaps you know how but something
yet remains

  as he uttered these words the face of
senor perote became livid

  santa anna caught the sides of the
chair for support his eyes were fixed
upon the pistol which this dreadful man
held in his hand he moistened his ups
repeatedly then murmured in a faint
voice

   surely senor you have not come
here-to kill me-i who am leading the
soldiers of mexico to victory

  senor perote laughed harshly

   even you do not believe that for
the americans are advancing upon the
capital but-he paused for a mo-
ment- when i swore to kill the man
who called himself senor urrea  did
not know what position he held in mex-
ico it may he possible senor that a
way can be found to spare the person of
general santa anna

  the dictator swallowed nervously

  it is in my power to reward you
richly every man has his price tell
me yours senor perote

  the ex-innkeeper shrugged his shoul-
ders

  you would promise much to-night
ard forget to-morrow you will per-
mit me to leave your presence because
you can not do otherwise but at the
first opportunity you would have me
tortured still being what you are i
may allow you to live

  a little of the ghastly color left the
dictators face but he still trembled vio-
lently

   i would ask you why it was you lied
to me for what purpose did santa
anna ruler of mexico drug and rob two
of his officers asked perote coldly

  santa anna pressed his lips close to-
gether

  why do you demand to know
that perhaps it was a personal
matter he answered harshly

  believing he should be spared some-
thing of his self-assurance was return-
ing

   i am awaiting an answer said
perote quietly

  santa anna glanced at the stern set
face above him and he saw something
there which warned him the danger
was not yet passed perotes lips were
trembling and his deep-set eyes gleamed
fiercely

  he resembled some terrible monster
from the mountain fastness more than
a human being

   you would ask me why  desired the
papers how can that knowledge
benefit you asked the dictator in a
hesitating voice

    am waiting replied senor perote
once more

   why i took the papers from amador
and valeno

   from amador and valeno who tor-
tured me

   it was because i wished to have
them in my power-to force them to
serve me faithfully answered santa
anna in a hoarse voice

  senor perote smiled grimly

   and you took that way it is easy
to see what occurred an officer en-
trusted with important despatches mer-
its death if hepermits those despatches
to be taken from him you stole the
papers from these men while they slept
therefore they merited death having
lost the papers

  it lay with you their superior and
you spared them-so long as they agreed
to serve you in all tilings it was for
that i was tortured in the inn on the
acapulco road because general santa
anna desired to rule through fear those
who would not otherwise do his bid-
ding

  several minutes of silence followed
to the man cringing in the chair they
seemed an hour finally perote spoke
in a voice filled with bitterness

   it was something to become a
marked man-an object of loathing and
pitv to every one in the world that is
what has happened to me but there is
something more i will tell you in
the eleventh rider



order that vou may better understand
the bitterness which consumes me 
lie drew his hand across his forehead
on which large drops of perspiration had
gathered then continued in a dull tone
i it so happened that a certain one
dwelling in the capital had promised to
marry me there was no one in all
mexico to compare with her after this
thing happened i went southward and
appeared before her

   you should be able to judge what
took place a woman loves manly
beauty and she is a woman i have
lost more than life itself i desire only
to die-after  have drained the cup of
revenge

  santa anna made no reply for the
first time he understood how terrible
might be the vengeance of the man
before him

  senor perote replaced the pistol in
his sash

   i fear neither your anger nor the
hate of any man said he fiercely  i
was a mexican but you see what mexico
has done for me  am resolved to
drink the cup of revenge to the very
dregs and in doing so it is necessary
that mexico suffer

  the soldiers sent to capture the
handful of americans in the pass of el
yidio returned with the news that their
victims had flown it was i who
warned general taylor and conducted
his messenger across the mountains it
is believed by many that i am loyal to
mexico but from this hour you urill
know otherwise and vet this knowledge
will profit you nothing

  his eves while he was speaking wan-
dered around the room and rested upon
a crucifix hanging above a small table
between the windows he looked down
at the man cowering in the chair santa
annas lips moved spasmodically the
heavy lids of his black eves were half
closed but under them shone a gleam
of cunning

  he glanced up at the avenging figure
towering above him

   you will kill captain valeno per-
haps-as you did the other  he asked
in a strained voice

  at the proper lime opportunity
has been given me but  choose my
own methods answered perote coldly

  the dictator of mexico shuddered

   some things are worse than death
he muttered

  seiior perote pointed to the crucifix

   remove it from the wall do you
hear me seiior  said lie sternly

  santa anna hesitated then arose
from the chair crossed the room and
took down the crucifix an expression
of fear and perplexity was upon his
face

    know that to you a promise is
nothing for your whole life is made up
of acts of treachery continued perote
quietly

  he pointed to the crucifix

   any man who accepts your word is
more than a fool but an oath taken
upon the bleeding body of christ is not
so easily broken swear to me upon
that sacred emblem that neither to-
night nor at any time will you seek to
destroy me that having departed from
this room you will not seek to follow
or have me followed swear it senor 

  a look of baffled rage crossed the dic-
tators face he remained silent

  swear ordered perote swear
seiior or bv that sacred token i
will-

  he drew from his sash a long-bladed
knife and poised it in his right hand

  the fingers which clasped the cruci-
fix trembled a ghastly smile distorted
the lips of the ruler of mexico at the
last moment he was to be cheated of his
revenge

  the face of perote was something ter-
rible to look upon the livid outlines
of the double scar seemed to deepen as
each second passed he ran his fingers
gently along the keen edges of the knife
and took a step forward

  it appeared as though the knees of
santa anna would give way under him

   i swear it on the cross i swear it 
he murmured in a hoarse voice

  senor perote replaced the knife in
his sash

   i will bid you adios seiior said he
coldly and deliberately turning his back
upon the man who hated him but whose
fangs he had drawn he unlocked the
door passed through it and closed the
portal softly

for a moment santa anna stood as
though rooted to the floor his face was


the argosy

white with passion and a thin froth
appeared upon his lips it seemed as
though he would rush to the door and
call loudly to the guard below his fin-
gers clutched convulsively upon the
ivory image in his hand they re-
laxed and the crucifix dropped to the
floor

  with a hoarse cry-the cry of a sav-
age beast cheated of its prey-the dicta-
tor of mexico threw himself upon the
bed and tore the sheets into ribbons

  even he respected an oath taken on
the cross

  senor perote descended the stairs and
walked out upon the veranda the guard
saluted stiffly

   the senor captains command have
but just passed  wish the senor suc-
cess at the inn on the acapulco road
said he in a deferential voice

   i thank you senor answered
perote coldly  i am generally suc-
cessful in what i undertake

  he descended the steps leading to the
ground and walked toward the town

  the guard shrugged his shoulders and
muttered under his breath it is as
he says truly this mazatlan is a terri-
ble man i would rather meet the
devil than encounter him in anger

chapter xii

a gap in the circle

  the inn over which senor perote had
once officiated presented a gloomy and
forbidding appearance the windows
were boarded over the door loose upon
its hinges and a heap of half-burned
embers and ashes marked the spot where
had once stood a likely stable

  some little distance back of this de-
serted hostelry was a low hill the
summit of which was covered with
bushes and rank vegetation at the
base of the hill on the side farthest
from the inn a deep depression ex-
tended for perhaps half a mile toward
the north

  at certain seasons of the year the
bottom of this ditch was covered with
water but in the summer time was
dry affording a comfortable shelter
lor any one desirous of concealing him-

  late in the afternoon of tne aay
which had witnessed their departure
from chaleo two men occupied this nat-
ural hiding-place they were lieuten-
ant haddon and the texan the latter
who had been examining the landscape
from the summit of the hill had just
returned to his companion

   either he has gone astray or has
decided not to follow your suggestion
for i take it for granted he has not
fallen again into the hands of the mex-
icanssaid he

   any of the three is possible for had
he come straight from chaleo he could
have reached this place shortly after
daybreak answered the virginian in
an anxious voice

   as matters now stand it would be
better that he avoid this neighborhood
as he would the devils hunting-ground
there he would meet only one fiend of
hell while somewhere out yonder are
twoscore or more led by that wolf
mazatlan

  sergeant bradley uttered this blunt
speech with an embellishment of choice
texan oaths jsio less anxious than his
companion he had a different way of
showing his disquietude

  the americans had grave cause for
apprehension anderson the artillery-
man whom haddon had liberated from
the stone house in chaleo had not ap-
peared at the rendezvous

  had he decided to push straight for
the american lines without waiting for
the virginian to join him as had been
agreed upon all might be well but if
he had lost his way or been forced to
make a wide detour to avoid the
mexicans scattered over the country
his delayed arrival at the inn might
prove his destruction

  somewhere behind the hills which
dotted the landscape lay mazatlan and
ins guerritlcros to appear pushing
forward in fancied security would be to
walk into a trap which meant a speedy
perhaps painful death

  concerning the rumored approach of
a detachment of american cavalry itad-
don and his companion felt less coucern

  mazatlans plan was to permit the
northerners to ride farther into the
country where they would be ambuscad-
ed or if they elected to take possession of
the eleventh rider



the deserted tavern for a night to sur-
round the place and fall upon them in
the darkness

  either of these plans could be frus-
trated by a timely warning

  that mazatlan should lead an expedi-
tion whose object was to wipe out the
expected party of americans was an-
other mystery added to those with
which the virginian was grappling lie
had however come to a conclusion
though one far from satisfactory the
mexican was conducting his method of
vengeancc in his own peculiar way
secretly he aided the cause of the in-
vaders of his country but openly before
the eyes of his followers he was proving
a stern foe to the americans

  in reaching this perplexing conclu-
sion haddon had come to a definite de-
cision it was his duty to capture this
guerrilla leader and put an end to his
depredations

  as mazatlan he would meet a merited
punishment at the hands of the ameri-
cans but as perote who had twice saved
him from death as a spy the mans life
might be spared though he would be
held a prisoner

  another phase of the mystery had-
don had considered carefully and the
true answer baffled him might it not
be possible that the mexican was at
heart an enemy but by professing
friendship and in twice saving him
haddon he had hit upon a cunning plan
whereby he could obtain admittance to
the very headquarters of general tay-
lor himself

  as perote he could learn the plans of
the hostile forces as mazatlan he could
convey these plans to santa anna such
was the uncertainty under which nad-
don labored the only true solution of
the difficulty was to capture mazatlan

  for the twentieth time within an hour
the american crawled to the summit of
the hill  the texan who by lifelong
practice possessed the keener vision
under such conditions shaded his eyes
with his hand suddenly he turned
sharply and caught haddon by the
shoulder

   look there sir said he with con-
siderable excitement over there
where the highway dips behind the hills
it is a horseman

  haddon followed the direction of the
outstretched finger far away a dark
blot on the landscape a moving object
was discernible it was as the texan
had stated a horseman and he was
riding toward the deserted inn

  the minutes dragged slowly the
sun approaching the summit of the
western hills threw a yellow glare over
the uneven landscape to the ameri-
cans waiting impatiently it seemed that
never before had a traveler ridden so
leisurely

  each was thinking of the same thing
was the distant horseman a mexican or
the man who had been saved from death
in chaleo 

  regardless of all attempt at conceal-
ment the texan climbed to the top of a
rock and stood motionless his eyes
focused on the moving figure ten
minutes passed a quarter of an hour
a half then the texan made an excited
movement

  some distance beyond the straight
stretch of road which ran past the front
of the inn the highway disappeared in a
hollow of the plain sergeant bradley
had watched the horseman ride into this
depression for perhaps three minutes
he was lost to view and then something
happened

  the tider had entered the hollow
leisurely when he reappeared on the
side nearest the inn his horse was gal-
loping furiously a cloud of dust aris-
ing like a puff of yellow smoke sur-
rounded him

  the texan and haddon could see that
the man was urging the horse forward
bv even means in his power at inter-
vals he turned and looked behind him

  a dozen fifty a hundred rods nearer
and the reason for the metamorphosis
became apparent behind from out
the hollow a second and a third horse-
man issued striving to overtake the
first the pursuing riders were mexi-
can guerrilleros

  sergeant bradley dropped from the
rock into the shelter of the bushes be-
side haddon

   it is the man we have been waiting
for he has obtained a horse some-
where but he cannot outride those
devils who are chasing him he burst
out excitedly

	a


the argosy

  haddon did not answer his atten-
tion was riveted upon the race toward
the deserted inn

   to reach this goal of temporary safety
was the object of the fugitive to over-
take him on the highway the purpose of
the mexicans

   suddenly a puff of smoke arose above
the neck of the first of the pursuing
horsemen the dull crack of a carbine
shot echoed among the hills

   sergeant bradley made a fierce ges-
ture

   my god sir he has no chance 
cried he bitterly

  but it appeared the mexicans aim
had been bad for the first horseman
dashed on with unabated speed
lashing his mount madly with his
clenched hands

   a fourth a fifth a dozen horsemen
arose as though by magic from the hol-
low stringing out along the highway in
the rear of the first two mexicans
there was a second puff of smoke and a
second report a sharp exclamation
simultaneously escaped the two ameri-
cans

  the horse tidden by the fugitive
wavered swayed unsteadily yet kept on
but with speed visibly lessened a
hoarse shout a crv of triumph arose
from the pursuing guerriueros the
flash of a drawn saber glittered in the
yellow sunlight

  sergeant bradley was trembling in
every limb

    god sir  he cried  and we lie
here while they butcher him before our
eyes 

   he was upon his feet his pistol in his
right hand the reckless bravery of
the man was asserting itself and he
saw only the wounded horse and its
luckless rider that the pursuing mexi-
cans numbered a dozen was of secondary
consideration

  haddon seized him by the arm

    what are you going to do  he de-
manded sharply

   the texan jerked himself loose took
a step forward and then stopped sud-
denly

  look he cried look at that
sir

   a wonderful thing had happened it
seemed as if the angel of fate had inter-

posed an invisible barrier between the
victim and the bloodthirsty devils who
pursued him

  the wounded horse had come to a
dead stop in the center of the highway
at that moment the desperate artillery-
man leaped from the saddle and dashed
on foot toward the door of the inn not
twenty rods away

  scarcely had his feet touched the
ground when the stricken horse col-
lapsed tumbling in a shapeless heap in
the middle of the road the foremost
gucrrillero golloping madly forward
could not check his mount in timethe
knees of his own beast struck the pros-
trate body of the dying horse it was
as though a thunderbolt had descended
from heaven and palsied the hand which
was preparing to wield the fatal saber

  the shock of the contact hurled the
mexican from his saddle he shot for-
ward through space turned a half-
somersault in midair and struck the
ground with terrific force twenty feet
from the spot where his horse had
fallen

  a shout of rage arose from the other
gucrrilleros the second pursuer checked
his horse just in time to avoid the fate
of his companion in the middle of the
road lay the mexican his neck broken
and t wo struggling animals

  it is probable that the man who so
narrowly escaped a saber stroke did not
realize what had occurred for without
looking back he ran at top speed over
the distance which separated him
lrom the inn dashed through the
door and slammed the latter behind
him

  from their point of observation
iladdon and his companion saw the-
mexicans ride up one ly one and dis-
mount beside the dead gnerrillero and
stiffening horses

  they were too far away to permit of
their words being audible but gestures
aie frequently as potent as words and
it was evident that a fate even worse
than death would overtake the man in
the inn should he fall into the power of
such captors

   lie first body of mexicans numbered
ten or a dozen but now others appeared
ridmg out of the hollow two rode
side by side in advance
the eleventh rider



  a dark look settled over the face of
the texan 

  if i am not mistaken yonder is
mazatlan and the fellow he called
valeno those greasers will not re-
main for long staring stupidly at a dead
man said he

  the surmise was correct upon the
approach of the two horsemen the
mexicans standing in the road drew
back

  one of the riders rode close to the
dead guerrillcro appeared to put a ques-
tion then turned with a sharp gesture

  at the same moment the horsemen
who had dismounted climbed hastily
into their saddles

   mazatlan is giving orders mut-
tered the texan now we shall see
what will happen

   they are going to attack the inn
answered iladdon

  the texan uttered a sharp oath

    if they go about it in the right way
it is all up with that daring fellow in-
side he cant hold out five minutes
muttered he

   wait said the virginian c they
will not rush the house as we might do
it is not the mexican guerrilleros
method of fighting they know the
man inside is an american and that an
american can shoot straight when
necessary they do not propose to risk
losing a man or two when they can ac-
complish their purpose in another way

  the texan gave vent to a fiery oath
which seemed to partially relieve his
feelings

   if it were possible to get down there
who knows what would happen with
three of us behind the walls this mazat-
lan might receive a lesson he would not
forget in a hurry

  haddon shook his head

  it would be useless and we should
only walk into a trap even if we could
hold the house for a few hours it would
end the same way for our ammunition
would soon be exhausted and we should
be overpowered or roasted alive said
lie soberly

  sergeant bradley made an impatient
gesture

    that is excellent reasoning sir but
i will agree to kill half a dozen of those
fellows before they take me mazatlan

will be the first to get a bullet through
the head that is something

  iladdon smiled faintly the little
man at his side was terribly in earnest
and the contempt which he felt for the
mexicans was visible in ever word and
action

  left alone he would have dashed
down the hill into the inn and died
fighting like a demon the paramount
desire of a texan ranger was to kill as
man mexicans as possible the vir-
ginian remained silent for several mo-
ments then-nodded in the direction of
the western hills

   daylight is passing and the moon
does not rise till close on midnight
said he  what these mexicans intend
to do will he done after nightfall but
of one thing we may be assured they
will not attack the inn directly for by
doing so a certain number of firearms
will be discharged and that is just what
mazatlan wishes to avoid he did not
come here to capture a single prisoner
but to ambush the detachment of cav-
alry which he believes may pass through
this neighborhood

   if he attacks the inn and shots are
exchanged the noise would warn who-
ever was in the vicinity that an enemy
was near i do not doubt the mexicans
will try to capture the man who has
taken possession of the house yonder
but it will not be by a direct attack

   what we must do is to wait until
darkness and it may then be possible
to take some action in the mean time
all that we can do is to remain under
cover and warn our cavalry of the pres-
ence of the guerrilleros under mazatlan
provided any of our cavalry are in this
neighborhood

  sergeant bradley glanced at the
horsemen on the highway

   it is as you say sir mazatlan will be
careful about making too much noise
and-see there they are up to some-
thing

  haddon looked through the bushes
several of the mexicans had again dis-
mounted and were dragging the fallen
horses from the highway a couple
lifted their dead comrade and laid him
across one of the saddles mazatlan
appeared to be giving directions the
horsemen spread out to the left and


the argosy

right and a single mexican turned his
mount and galloped back toward the
hollow

   it is as  thought said haddon
quietly  it is their purpose to place
guards on every side of the inn so that
the man in there will have no oppor-
tunity of making his escape it is plain
that this guerrillaleader is no bungler

  several of the mexican horsemen
were already crossing the fields on either
side of the inn their purpose being to
form a circle of men completely around
the building

   it appears said the texan dryly
 that we are to be surrounded

   which proves it fortunate that we
left our horses a mile or more from this
spot let us see what these fellows are
going to do replied the virginian

  the mexicans who had separated
themselves from the main body were
following the arc of a great circle at
certain points in this circle a horseman
pulled up and retired to the shelter of a
clump of bushes or behind a rise of
ground

  the inn was now surrounded on three
sides a single guerrillero continued on
his course he was the man detailed to
take his position directly in the rear of
the deserted hostelry

  the virginian and his companion
looked at each other and a grim expres-
sion of satisfaction came into the face
of the texan

  the lone guerrillero had completed
half of the arc of the circle and on his
left and right his companions had sta-
tioned themselves perhaps a quarter of
a mile separating the watchers the
mexican pulled up his horse and looked
carefully around him he had been or-
dered bv mazatlan to take a position
directly to the north of the inn and he
was examining the ground to discover
the most likely hiding-place his eyes
fell upon the low hill crowned by the
thick fringe of bushes and rank vegeta-
tion it commanded every rod of
ground in the rear of the house anti
afforded an excellent view in all direc-
tions

  the guerrillero gathered up his reins
and began slowly to approach the base
of the hill beaching the ascent he
led his horse up the incline

  at the top he halted and again ex-
amined his surroundings the dry ditch
appealed to him as an excellent hiding-
place for a horse he descended the
farther side of the hill and entered the
hollow still leading his steed by the
bridle

  a soft step sounded behind him it
might have been the noise made bv a
rabbit scurrying away in fright the
mexican turned his head quickly but
what he saw was only a fleeting vision

  a hand closed like a steel vise about
his throat and something flashed in the
fading sunlight

  a sharp pain darted through the
guerrillergs body-a pang of agony
which ceased almost as soon as it began
the inert body of a man dropped noise-
lessly to the ground and lay without
motion

  sergeant bradley bent down and
wiped the blade of his knife upon the
dead mans embroidered jacket turn-
ing he faced haddon

  i fancy sir he said grimly that
when the time comes mazatlan will find
a gap in the circle which he has drawn
about the inn down there

chapter xiii

what the moon saw

  the moon balancing in a cloudless
sky bathed the landscape in a light of
weird silver somewhere among the dis-
tant hills a lone wolf howled dismally
sergeant bradley swore softly

  since the sun had set a yellow ball in
the west be had watched from the sum-
mit of the hill behind tlu inn of senor
perote it was well toward midnight
and nothing had happened

  looking down upon the roof of the
tavern and beyond across the unculti-
vated fields he saw only desolation-not
a living object stirring not a sound ex-
cept those incident to the night yet
he knew that in the silent hostelry the
prisoner who had escaped from the
stone house of chaleo kept vigilant
guard that among the hills which bor-
dered on the deserted fields mazatlan
gufrrilleroft were patiently waiting for
the handful of unsuspecting riders from
the north
the eleventh rider



  the presence of the dead man lying
in the ditch near by held no terror for

him but the texan chafed at inactivity
a pistol shot the sound of hoof-beats
the voices of men riding in the moon-
light would bring twoseore yelling dev-
ils from cover but none of these things
came

   only silence and the play of the weird
shadows upon the hills

  he knew that iladdon was some-
where in his rear watching the highway
from the north did they come at all
that was the road over which the de-
tachment of american scouts would
approach the inn

  for want of better occupation he
drew hi knife and began to hack at the
roots of the bush behind which he lay

  suddenly he paused the blade sus-
pended in the air

  somewhere on his right some dis-
tance off the sound of approaching feet
broke the stillness of the night lie sat
upright and listened

  the sound grew clearer-the crunch
crunch of feet upon the flinty soil
sergeant bradley transferred the knife
to his left hand and with his right
drew from his sash a pistol acute of
hearing he knew that not more than
one or two persons were approaching

  was it haddon or an enemy

  the crunching upon the stones drew
nearer and peeping through the bushes
the texan could make out the forms of
two men silhouetted in the moonlight
the grasp of his fingers upon his
weapons tightened the men were
mexicans

  a voice broke the silence with a few
words uttered in spanish but they told
sergeant bradley what he wished to
know-why the soldiers of santa anna
had appeared suddenly before him it
was an officer with his escort making the
rounds of the guards who formed the
circle enclosing the inn it was ma-
zatlans desire to see that none of these
guards was sleeping

  a wild hope found birth in the tex-
ans breast and he leaned eagerly for-
ward what if the officer should be ma-
zatlan himself he had sworn to shoot
mazatlan

  the mexicans were standing motion-
less a dozen rods away-so far that ser-

geant bradley could not distinguish
faces the one who had before spoken
turned toward his companion

   he is stationed somewhere on this
hill it will be bad for him if we find
him asleep among the bushes said he
roughly

   with senor valenos permission i
will go forward and look for him an-
swered the second mexican

  sergeant bradley experienced a pang
of disappointment it was not then
mazatlan-only a miserable mexican
officer the man who had talked with
mazatlan opposite the stone house in
chaleo

   the soldier evidently obtained silent
consent to follow his suggestion for he
walked across the slope of the hill pul-
ing some distance to the right of the
crouching american captain valeno
remained alone leaning carelessly on
his saber

  several minutes passed the silence
became oppressive sergeant bradley
lurking behind his bush began to won-
der what had become of the absent
soldier

  the thought even came to him to
crawl noiselessly upon the waiting offi-
cer and strike before he c-ould cry out
but he only smiled grimly it would be
time enough for action if the second
mexican discovered the guard was miss-
ing or that his body lav at the bottom of
the dry ditch

  impatient as he was to throw him-
self upon a hated enemy the texan
knew a false move might be fatal to the
instructions haddon had given him it
was his duty to watch not to engage in
a combat on the hilltop with a dozen of
mazatlans guerrilleros within hearing
distance he wotdd fight only if it be-
came necessary

  the time lengthened captain va-
leno moved impatiently and began to
look carefully about him he advanced
a few yards nearer to the silent texan
stopped and swore fiercely

   where are you sartillo  why in
the devils name are you loitering is the
guard not here  he called in an angry
voice

  sergeant bradley expected to hear a
reply but only silence answered the im-
patient demand captain valeno swore


the argosy

for the second tune and his saber rat-
tled

    sartillo you devil where are you 
adi  to stand here all night  he de-
manded fiercely

  suddenly a figure appeared advanc-
ing through the moonlight toward the
angry mexican sergeant bradley
thought ir was the tardy sartillo come
to report that the guard was nowhere
to be found

  captain valeno heard the footsteps
approaching him and turned sharply a
torrent of abuse upon his lips but it
was not forthcoming the texan saw
him start violently peer forward and a
question took the place of the oaths he
would have uttered

   it is you senor-mazatlan  i am
waiting for-

  a look of the keenest satisfaction
leaped into the eyes of the american
he half-raised the muzzle of his pistol
his finger toying with the trigger then
a strange thing happened

  the man whom captain valeno had
addressed as mazatlan whom he had
plainly recognized by the livid double
scar sprang like a wild beast toward the
throat of his own officer

  captain valeno uttered the single
cry  oh god and went down with a
crash which sent the stones rattling
down the hillside

  then before the eyes of the aston-
ished texan a terrific struggle took
place a shriek of agony echoed
across the hills the glitter of steel
flashed thrice in the moonlight and one
of the combatants arose to his feet

  all thought of using the pistol he held
vanished from the texans mind he
sat motionless staring at the figure of
the man standing above his groaning
victim

  suddenly this man bent down and
peered into the face of the form upon
the ground a hoarse laugh reached
the texans ears-a laugh which made
him shudder though lie had faced death
a hundred times and close upon this
sound more demoniacal than human
a voice rang out across the hill

  it is thus perote repays those who
injure him senor a hundred times
have i held my hand when opportunity
was given me to strike because i chose to

find you near the inn where you tortured
me you have ventured near that inn
to-night senor valeno

  the mexican upon the ground strug-
gled to a half-sitting posture sergeant
bradley could not see his face but he
knew that he was desperately wounded

  valeno raised one hand toward the
man who gloated over him

   mercy senor in the name of god
spare me he cried in a trembling
voice

   and you ask that-you who blew
upon the charcoal that the iron might
heat more quickly did you spare me
then seiior valeno 

   in the name of heaven as you hope
for forgiveness it was a mistake we
believed you had taken the paper and
the paper missing death stared us in the
face and that urrea-it was he who
caused it-i can direct you to him that
you may strike-

   then you think i do not know
perhaps santa anna dictator of mex-
ico might tell you differently it was
in truth that urrea who lied to me in
order to obtain the paper he lied but-
he did not torture answered seiior
perote coldly

 the wounded man overcome by
weakness fell back upon the ground
yet he continued to cry out feebly beg-
ging for mercy seiior perote laughed
for the second time

   you expect that and i have killed
an innocent man in order to reach you
i struck down the soldier who accompa-
nied you to this place and lie had never
injured me do you think then i will
spare you-who took the iron from the
fire  

  he uttered the words with awful
calmness and his disfigured face in the
white light was the pitiless face of a
demon

  captain valeno threw up his arms
and shrieked in terror through the
mist of blood which covered his eyes he
could only vaguely distinguish the form
of his enemy

  in the weird light the form of the ex-
innkeeper seemed to be floating in a
wave of crimson which surged backward
and forward like the surface of the sea

  suddenly perote bent down and said
in n cold voice
the eleventh rider



   yes senor i will grant you mercy-
the mercy you denied me when i lay
bound upon the floor of my own house
had you killed me then you would have
been merciful-that mercy i will grant
you captain valeno

  lie raised the knife and struck down-
ward at the first blow the man upou
the ground shrieked wildly after the
second he lay perfectly still

  the spell was broken sergeant
bradley sprang to his feet and raised
is pistol its muzzle covered the man
who was wiping the blade of his knife
upon the jacket of the victim the
texans finger pressed the trigger hut
no flash or report answered the falling
of the hammer the weapon refused to
he discharged

  sergeant bradley uttered a sharp
oath and hurled the useless weapon into
the bushes but if it was his intention to
attack the man before him with his
knife it was too late

  senor perote darted away with the
swiftness of a mountain wildcat and was
at the foot of the hill before the texan
realized he was gone

  leaning forward he watched the hazy
figure hastening across the level ground
which lay between the elevation and the
silent inn a slight noise sounded be-
hind him he turned quickly the knife
held ready for defense but there was no
need to use it

  two men were pushing through the
undergrowth and the first way lieuten-
ant haddon

   in gods name demanded the vir-
ginian breathlessly  vhat has taken
place have you been attacked
no but i have seen the devil
dressed like a mexican you will find
two dead men lying over there an-
swered the texan dryly

  lie seized haddon by the arm

    have seen many strange things
and have gone through some myself but
to see a mexican officer murder in cold
blood two of his own followers startles
one a little that is what has just oc-
curred do you know who has been
here mazatlan if it were not for
that corpse yonder i should believe i
had been dreaming

  c glanced curiously at the man who
  was standing behind the virginian

  you have found some one said
he

   it is anderson and over yonder
the road is black with our own cavalry-
men was haddons unexpected an-
swer

  for a moment sergeant bradley re-
mained perfectly quiet an expression of
bewilderment on his face

   god knows sir there has never
been weak-minded ones in my family
but  have seen that over there and now
i am to believe a miracle has happened

i	have scarcely taken my eves from that
inn for four hours and during that time
no one has left it yet you tell me thin is
the man who barricaded himself behind
its walls

   which is the truth and who do
you think led him so unexpectedly out
of that trap it was mazatlan  re-
plied the virginian

  the texan passed his fingers through
his hair

   tell me that our army is already in
the capital of mexico  it only requires
that to convince me that the moonlight
has turned my brain a moment ago i
saw this guerrilhro leader slay his own
officer and now you tell me it was he
who took the man he wished to kill out
of that house

  you are not mad for that is just
what has happened you know that
this inn was a very old one and that
many of the old houses in mexico arc
provided with secret entrances and
exits anderson was in there watching
the doors and windows when a step
sounded in the room next to the one
he occupied the next moment a man
appeared in the doorway-a man whose
face was disfigured by dreadful scars

  it was mazatlan muttered the
texan

   who else anderson would have
shot him when the fellow spoke

    lower your pistolsenorfor i have
come to take you out of this place be-
hind the house are waiting those who
will save you from the gucrritteros one
is the senor haddon

  in gods name mazatlan knows
that we are here broke in the texan

   it would appear so else he could not
have told anderson at any rate our
countryman decided to trust this


the argosy

strange creature determining to shoot
him at the first sign of treachery but
the mexican did exactly as he promised

   going on in front he led anderson
to the mouth of a trap door which gave
into a passage running beneath the
ground reaching the end of this pas-
sage our comrade found himself in a
dense covering of bushes his myste-
rious guide turned and pointed to the
left

    go senor that way will bring you
to the highroad beyond the circle of the
guerrillerossaid he quietly and disap-
peared

   it is -gods truthv broke in the ar-
tilleryman   it happened just as lieu-
tenant haddon has stated i followed
the direction and came out upon the
highway xot fifty feet away a body
of horsemen were sitting silently in
their saddles and lieutenant haddon
was talking to one of them

   it was the cavalry we have been ex-
pecting which the mexicans proposed
to ambush added the virginian then
with a grim smile  but something else
will happen it is not a single detach-
ment of onr scouts who are waiting back
there but-the advance guard of our
army general taylor has scattered the
mexicans in the north and is advancing
vpun chaleo

   and mazatlan   sergeant brad-
ley put the question as one who did not
clearly comprehend whether he was
awake or dreaming

   we may learn more of mazatlan
later answered haddon gravely he
was wondering what the next few hours
would bring forth-what would happen
when the moment arrived for which the
twoscore guerrilleros from chaleo were
waiting

  he left the texans side and walked
across the intervening space which sep-
arated him from the still figure lying on
the ground

  captain valeno lay upon his back his
faeo turned toward the cloudless sky
looking down haddon thought to meet
only the stony gaze of one who had died
a violent death but what lie saw caused
him to turn quicklv away

  the face of the dead mexican was
flashed so horribly as to be unrecogniz-
able even bv his closest friend and

these terrible wounds had been inflicted
before the fatal knife thrust pierced his
heart

chapter xiv

  the revenge of senor perote

  the plan which lieutenant haddon
and the commander of the regiment of
american cavalry had formulated was
extremely simple but it gave promise of
bringing about a desired result-that
of drawing anattack from the mexican
guerrilleros

  the force of northern horsemen out-
numbered maza hans followers ten to
one and from these five hundred odd
troopers a detail of twenty-five were
selected

  these under the command of had-
don and one of their own sub-officers
separated themselves from the main
body which had halted two miles to the
north of the inn

   the horses were put into a gallop and
advanced with considerable noise along
the highway to the door of the hostelry
the mexicans watching from their
hiding-places saw these apparently un-
suspecting invaders dismount and pre-
pare to bivouac for the remainder of the
night some entered the inn from
whose chimney smoke presently ap-
pearedothers led the horses behind the
building and began to search about for
fodder

  not many moments after the ameri-
cans had begun such preparations a mes-
senger entered the main camp of the
guerrilleros which was situated in a de-
pression half a mile south of the inn

  he reported what had taken place-
that within an hour the enemy whom-
mazatlan had ridden northward from
chaleo to crush at a single blow would
be sleeping the sleep of exhausted men
ihen would come the opportunity for
which he waited

   mazatlan his back propped against a
tree a cigarette between his lips heard
the report and smiled grimly could
lieutenant haddon have seen that
smile he might have doubted the sur-
mise at which he had arrived--that the
guerrilla leader would in some manner
sacrifice ins command the virginian
had become firmly convinced that senor
the eleventh rider



perote was in truth a traitor to mexico
and that he had led tlie guerrilieros
northward to give them over to the
americans

  llow this would be accomplished re-
mained a mystery but in any case
whether or no his surmise should prove
o be correct the result must be the
same what chance would forty-odd
mexicans stand against a regiment of
general taylors picked cavalry

  mazatlan tossed aside the cigarette
and gave a few sharp orders the first
was that the sentinels should be called
in from their stations upon the hills
the second that his men should prepare
for combat-a combat in which no quar-
ter should be given

  a sub-officer a mere boy from the
district of cerro gordo approached his
commander

   the senor valeno is still absent
senor said he  it is reported by one
of the sentinels that strange cries were
heard upon the hills can it be possi-
ble-

  mazatlan was rolling another cigar-
ette he paused and looked into the
face of the young guerrillero

   it was the wolves the fool heard
molino doubtless senor valeno is
watching these americanos he will
turn up at the right time said he not
u n kindly

  the lad was the brother of the man
who lay dead upon the hill back of the
inn

  mazatlan lighted the cigarette and
blew a puff of smoke toward the waning
moon a swarthy sergeant stepped
before him and saluted

   two of the men are still absent
senor he reported

   bomind me of that afterward-
when we have wiped out these ameri-
canos i know how to deal with those
who are absent at such a time said he
gru ffly	 -

  an hour passed mazatlan called the
young guerrillero to him

   order the men into their saddles
molino the fools are sleeping soundly
by this time and remember-there is
to be no quarter if one of these
americanos is alive at sunrise i shall
know the reason said he sharply

  the expression which settled over the

disfigured face was not pleasing to look
upon it boded ill for the enemies of
mexico

  molino had seen it frequently before
and each time luckless american us had
been slaughtered without mercy

  the mexican horsemen moved in a
straggling line across the fields toward
the inn stretching out until they
formed a circle broken only at one
point

  mazatlan had drawn his saber and
the twoscore men on either side of him
unslung their carbines the trained
cavalry horses broke into a brisk trot as
the circle of evil faces and shining steel
closed in upon a common center

  the solitary sentinel standing before
the door of the inn looked across the
fields and saw the rapidly approaching
line of horsemen lie had received his
instructions and waited coolly-the ap-
proaching riders were not yet within
carbine shot

  the sound of galloping horses became
distinctly audible suddenly the sen-
tinel raised his carbine and fired turned
quickly and sprang through the open
door of the inn

  it was what mazatlan expected the
shot would awaken the sleeping ameri-
cans but before they could seize their
arms and defend the house his guerril-
ieros would be upon them

  a fierce spanish yell echoed across
the fields a tumult of liorses and
swarthy-faced riders swept like a whirl-
wind upon the inn from three sides a
dozen carbines flashed the bullets shat-
tering the boards over the windows

  the foremost of the guerrilieros
hurled his horse against the door beat-
ing upon it with his saber

  had the men within been suddenly
awakened from sleep nothing could
have withstood so sudden and un-
expected an attack as it was a score
of mexicans had thrown themselves
from their saddles and were rushing for-
ward forcing an entrance through the
doorway

  ii	seemed as though those within the
house must be stricken motionless with
terror and surprise no one opposed
the mad onrush of tle yelling guerril-
ieros-not a shot answered the discharge
of the hostile carbines


the argosy

  a dozen mexicans had forced their
way through the doorway with ready
pistols and uplifted saber but no one
fired and not a single blade descended

  because only blackness and utter
silence greeted those who were prepared
to engage in mortal combat had the
mexicans discharged their pistols had
they struck-the bullets and the saber
blades would have been wasted on the
empty air

  the interior of the inn contained not
a single american

  the guerrilleros who had forced their
way through the door stood motionless
those who pressed behind paused in
amazement

  a horseman forced his way to the
threshold it was mazatlan

   in the fiends name he shouted
fiercely  what is this if they will not
fight kill them where they kneel

  a voice from within the inn answered
hoarsely

   we cannot senor for-there is no
one here to kill 

  the guerrillero leader threw himself
from his saddle and rushed over the
threshold 

  what devils trick is this where
are the americanos  he shouted

  the guerrilleros gave way before him
a number began to cross themselves
mazatlan glared into the darkened
room

  a light what are you waiting
for he struck the mexican nearest
him with the hilt of his sword one of
the men tore off his jacket rolled it to-
gether and set fire to the cloth the
flame flared up and showed the room
-empty

   fire the house  shouted mazatlan
 if they are in the cellar-

  one of the guerrilleros touched him on
the arm

   pardon senor but now i remem-
ber  have heard that upon the aca-
pulco road was an inn which was pro-
vided with a secret passage it may be

possible-

    a thousand devils why did you
not think of that before they have
escaped that way but we will catch
them in the hills shrieked mazatlan

  he rushed through the door and out
into the moonlight the guerrilleros

who were in the house poured after
him and half had regained their sad-
dles mazatlan had gathered up his
reins when above the tumult of shout-
ing cursing men arose a sound familiar
to every cavalryman-the regular muf-
fled thunder of innumerable horses
hoofs pounding pounding upon a hard
roadbed a frenzied yell came from the
guerrilleros on the outskirts of the
crowd which pressed about the door of
the inn these looking up the high-
way saw an avalanche of dark forms
advancing in the moonlight

  as it approached the front of this
swiftly moving mass spread out into the
fields on either side of the road a
sheet of flame burst from the advancing
line the air was filled with leaden rain
which buzzed like a swarm of angry
bees and a dozen mexicans tumbled
from their saddles

  on the instant mazatlan compre-
hended what had happened lie not
the americans had been ambuscaded
he would have given no mercy and-he
asked for none

  shouting a sharp order he wheeled
his horse and spurred toward the ad-
vancing horde of northern cavalrymen
with a score of his guerrilleros following
him and in a moment mexicans and
americans were mingled in a strug-
gling melee

  haddon riding in the front rank of
the attacking lines saw a number of
swarthy passionate faces confronting
him lie warded off a saber stroke and
cut down the mexican who was pushing
his horse against his own

  as the man fell another pressed for-
ward from behind him this second
guerrillero was clad in a gold-embroid-
ered jacket and fought like a d emon
his face dark with passion was disg-
ured by two livid scars

  the press of horsemen before and
behind forced ijiese two so closely to-
gether that they gazed into each others
eyes but in those of the mexican came
no look of recognition

  for an instant iladdon saw the wild
ferocity which doubly distorted the hid-
eous features then his horse swerved to
the right it was all that saved him
from a fatal saber stroke

  in the brief instant given him for
the eleventh rider



thought what he believed io be the true
solution of tins mysterious mans
actions hashed through his brain he
had been trying to fathom the motives
of a madman this mexican who one
day betrayed santa anna and the next
turned with brutal ferocity against the
americans had been rendered insane by
his sufferings

  senor perote or mazatlan as one
chose was a maniac whose acts were
prompted by the workings of a diseased
brain

  now thoroughly upon his guard the
virginian parried a second stroke of the
flashing saber and even though he knew
the mexican was trying desperately to
cut him down he resolved if possible to
spare him

  he struck back fiercely but each time
twisted his saber so that did his adver-
sary receive the blow upon the head it
would be from the blunt side of the
weapon

  a thin froth appeared upon the lips
of the mexican angered beyond
measure that he could neither cut down
his enemy nor pass him he warded a
blow skilfully with his right hand and
at the same instant with his left
snatched a pistol from his sash had-
don saw the move and jerked his horse
back upon his haunches the ball
from the pistol buried itself in the ani-
mals shoulder mazatlan hurled his
own beast forward and lunged fiercely
with his sword but the point did not
reach his adversary

  at the very instant when the steel
was within an inch of haddons breast
and he powerless to parry a second
-alter struck aside that of the guerrilla
leader before mazatlan could re-
cover himself this second saber darted
forward and the point caught the mex-
ican squarely in the throat

  the horseman who had saved had-
don from death or a serious wound
turned his head sharply

   it was a close call sir when you
fight the devil do not try to spare
him

  having given utterance to this blunt
speech sergeant bradley turned and
hurh-d himself into the thickest of the
mlc

  so unequal a combat could not last

forever the americans pressing for-
ward at every side speedily cut the
handful of guerrilieros in pieces

  at the end of ten minutes half of
mazatians followers were dead a few
wounded and prisoners while a paltry
dozen lied panic-stricken across the
fields in the direction of chaleo

  after a little while lights were gleam-
ing in the inn opposite the triple boul-
ders tjpon the door of the main room
lay the body of the guerrilla leader
mazatlan the wound he had received
from the texans saber had not killed
him instantly and under haddons di-
rections he was lifted from the spot
where he had fallen and carried into the
house

  the surgeon of the cavalry regiment
bent over him and examined the wound
in the room were gathered haddon
sergeant bradley and a dozen american
officers some of them had seen the man
when as senor perote he had entered
the lines others knew of the famous
guerrilla chief onty by reputation

  the surgeon arose and shook his
head

   the man cannot live a quarter of
an hour with such a wound it is a
miracle he has lasted so long said he
gravely

  haddon looked upon the disfigured
fare and an expression of regret came
into his eyes he could not forget that
this man had freed him from his bonds
in that very inn that on three other
occasions he had rendered service to the
flag he served

  mazatlan stirred feebly and his eyes
opened haddon leaned forward for
it was possible he wished to say some-
thing the lips of the mexican parted
but  sound passed them

  he was staring straight ahead past
haddon-at the door

  the voice of sergeant bradley hoarse
with amazement broke the silence

  my god lieutenant look there

  the virginian turned quickly

  never to his dying day could he for-
get the sensation which passed over
him-a feeling of amazement unbelief
and terror

  in the open doorway stood the figure
of a man this man was a mexican
clad in the uniform of santa annas


the argosy

cavalry but it was not that which
had brought the exclamation to the
texans lips and stricken iladclon
dumb

  the face of the newcomer was turned
toward the light and that face was
frightfully disfigured by two livid scars
beginning at a joint near the center of the
chin and extending upward to the bottom
of the ears

  so intense a silence reigned in the
room that the faint breathing of the
dying man upon the floor could be dis-
tinctly heard then with an almost
imperceptible gesture the figure in the
doorway advanced a few feet within the
threshold

  his gaze traveled from the face of
the man upon the floor to that of lieu-
tenant haddon

   surely the senor has not forgotten
-i am perote said he quietly

  haddon stared mutely at the speaker
a faint smile touched the disfigured lips
of seiior perote

   i see-i understand why the senor
is amazed is it not so-the scars
said he

  iladdon recovered himself but his
face was wet with perspiration

   you are perote said he and there
was a hollow ring in his voice  who
then is this man

  perote looked down upon the figure
on the floor

  you should know senor for you
have been in chaleo who but mazat-
lan would santa anna send to ambush
the americans it is mazatlan but
before that happened he was seiior
amador

  suddenly something of the truth
dawned upon the virginian he re-
membered the face of the man whom
he had seen that night lying dead on
the hill behind the inn he knew that
more than one must have been con-
cerned in the disfigurement of senor
perote and the face of the man upon
the hill gave him an inkling of the
manner in which perote had worked out
his revenge

  now that the two faces each with the
livid double scar were before bis eyes
he noted that these sears were the result
of different kinds of wounds those
upon the face of the real perote were

broader as though made by some dull
instrument but except for this slight
difference each disfige eraent was strik-
ingly similar

he knew how the guerrilla leader
mazatlan had come by the scars which
made him a marked man yet he put the
question which hovered on his tongue
senor perote nodded grimly

   it is even so seiior for it was in
that manner i might make this man
share my suffering and some suffering is
worse than death

  lie paused then continued quietly
there were two this amador and
the other-valeno it so happened
that i permitted a certain paper to be
taken from them the robber fled and
they accused me of being an enemy to
mexico

   had they killed me nothing more
would have been heard about the mat-
ter for to kill a man in mexico is no
great thing they chose to torture me
under my own roof they burned me with
hot irons and laughed at my suffering

  from that hour a demon took pos-
session of me sleeping or waking i
desired but one thing-to find these
men and kill them

   it was one night that that one slept
in an inn in chaleo i watched his light
go out and waited until the inn was
quiet i crept through the open window
to the bed and looked down upon him

   it was in my mind to kill him as he
lay but the demon of revenge showed
me a better way it was done quickly
no light was necessary i cut deeply
even as he had burned me with the iron

  i knew that when the wounds
healed there would be in mexico two
who would carry to their graves a livid
cross a disfigurement which could only
be hidden in the tomb

  lie paused and looked from one face
to another then continued with awful
calmness

   i on know what occurred afterwar
the demon which possessed me entered
captain amador he became man-
lan who slew men for the love of kill-
ing i bated mexico-because the of-
ficers of santa anna had tortured me i
resolved to aid the invaders of mexico
that santa anna might be humbled
len to-night senors i have done some-
the eleventh rider



tiling for it was i who carried to chaleo
the report which sent mazatlan north-
ward and i knew that not a handful
of your cavalrymen but whole regi-
ments were pushing toward the cap-
ital

  haddon turned to the others in the
room

  it i-i as he says senor perote has
aided us in many ways already gen-
eral taylor has trusted him

  he turned to the mexican

   and now senor surely you will re-
main with us to-nights work will
tell santa anna whats in your heart
senor perote smiled grimly

    i do not fear santa anna senor
perhaps i alone of all mexico do not
fear him - your army is marching ou
the capital it may be permitted that i
serve you further

  the man upon the floor had remained
motionless for some minutes though his
eyes were fixed in a dreadful stare upon
the face of senor perote

  the surgeon bent over him and thrust
his hand beneath the braided jacket
over the heart for a moment he re-
mained in this attitude listening

   he is dead said be gravely

  a strange expression crossed the face
of senor perote he advanced a step
and stood gazing down upon the livid
double scar which crossed the features
of the dead guerrilla leader his lips
quivered he turned silently and re-
traced his steps to the door upon the
threshold he stopped

   ec is it not as i said sefiors  said he
in a quiet voice  such scars accom-

the

 puuy him who bears them even to the
 grave

   lie passed out into the moonlight
 and none in the room followed 
 seemed almost that the man who had
 been speaking-lay dead upon the floor

	  

   for many years after the capital had
 fallen and the northern invaders re-
 crossed the rio grande strangers who
 visited a certain part of mexico heard a
 curious tale

   it was said that in the mountain fast-
 ness beyond the lonely pass of cerro
 gordo there dwelt in a rude hut hidden
 in the chaparral a terrible old man
 tliis strange hermit never came into a
 town or near a place of habitation

   it was held by some that he was a
 holy man who was working out a pen-
 ance by a life of solitude and that the
 blessed privilege was permitted him to
 wear upon his person the figure of an in-
 delible cross

   others asserted however that the
 lone hermit had been guilty of an un-
 pardonable wickedness and that god
 had punished him by marking him for-
 ever so that all men might see and
 know

   these conflicting opinions had doubt-
 less found their source in the report
 brought from the mountains by a
 hunter who had met the man in a
 desolate ravine of resaca de la palma

   he had seen his face-a face horribly
 disfigured by two livid scars beginning
 near the center of the chin and extend-
 ing upward to a point a little below the
 lobe of each ear

how opportunity broke its rule knocked twice at the same gate and what came of it

the room was losing itself in twi-
light there was a somber touch
of shadow lighted by old gold a melan-
choly shaft of sun fell in a narrow line
of pale yellow across the hardwood
floor it was a time for memories and
for dreams

  elinor lying back in the shadowy
recess of an easy-chair felt it as she
spread open with caressing fingers the
letter in her lap her throat was con-
tracting her eyes were wells ol tears
the years of her waiting slipped from
her as a garment and with it she threw
off the cramping clinging fetters of the
past

  the thin foreign paper with its
closely written lines spelled only one
sentence to her sharpened fancy lloyd
was coming back-free

   lloyd -her lips framed his name
with whimsical tenderness for the
first time since his marriage she could
call him that without feeling the ghost
of their love rising before her threat-
eningly to close it with the terrible
dearness of outlawed possession the
little futile figure of his wife with all
her immature affection and unreasoning
jealousy had been swept forever from
the horizon she was dust

  for the first time elinor thought of
her with pity she seemed to be at the
beginning of things-to see with eyes
that had hitherto been accustomed only
to darkness the broad beautiful way of
a future remade in the light of it the
past grew less a thing of bitterness she
could look back upon it as one looks on
a grave grown green

  and it had all come right after all
there had been no dim hope to lure her
on she had never thought of him ex-
cept as of some one irretrievably lost
she had even kept down the sin of wish-
ing it different till into the bare lone-
liness of her quiescent life had fallen
this letter

  it said very little his wife had died
at nice in december-it was now april

and he was coming home to her free

if she had waited it might be as if their
parting had never been--and they could
marry at once and forget

  in a sudden passion of joy she crushed
the paper in her fingers bruising it with
the strength of her remembrance she
got up carrying it to the light that she
might read it again with a more com
plete interpretation

  and between the lines she read his
love-that was to make up for all-all-
all the whole gray tragedy of her un-
crowned maidenhood was vindicated

    elinor  

  she turned quickly

   oh martin-is it you come in 
her voice held a vibrant note quite
new to him-he was keenly alive to it
as he was to every change in her he
came in quietly as one accustomed to
the threshold and laying aside his hat
and cane seated himself by the win-
dow the light of it fell in unflattering
clearness across his large-featured face

  elinor glancing at him smiled to
herself-it was so palpably the face of a
friend-there was so little about him
of the lover she went over to a
center-table where a crystal lamp stood

 shall i light it she asked  or
will you wait till the tea comes in
he watched her white hand playing
with the globe against a background of
shadow

   dont he said  this light is per-
fect and any way ive only a minute to
stay i just dropped in on my way from
the club to see-well -he laughed a
trifle nervously- to see you you know
-and all that

  she crossed over to the easy-chair
throwing herself back in it with a low
sigh

     i wish she said k youd leave out
the  all that martin 
the space between



   lie smiled deprecat ingly

    i cant elinor - honestly and
why should i  

  she failed to answer him lie
laughed again-a laugh that lacked as-
surance

  my dear he said gently you
i do- i know what they mean to me-
those daily glimpses of you seeing you
n your own home is next to having you
-in mine since you wont come to
me well-mohammed must go to the
mountain thats all

   she tapped with one hand on the arm
of her chair and her face was slightly
troubled

    martin yon mustnt talk that way-
i any longer

   he looked at her quickly

    why not any longer elinor

   but she felt the pressure of a con-
strained silence he rose and went
over to her chair bending his tall figure
and accentuating the slight stoop of his
shoulders

    elinor he said   lets have it
  out

   his voice faltered then he went on
more steadily

    weve been years beating about the
bush you and i-weve almost knocked
all the blooms off weve been like chil-
dren playing a game and after all it
isnt wise dear to play games with
hearts ive tried my best to win out
but you havent exactly been square-
you havent let me know whether i had
any show im a stupid old chap but
ive loved you for a long time doesnt
that count for something 

   his hand sought hers where it lay on
her lap but she drew it suddenly away
no no martin-not that
instinctively he straightened up
i folding his arms in pained silence
with a feeling of compunction she
touched his sleeve

    martin-oh martin-aint you just
be my friend  

   he shook his head sadly

    ive been trying to all my life he
 said   since we were children together
 but elinor its hardly fair-to me
 she bit her lips

    i know she said uncertainly  but
 you knew the truth--yon knew i loved
 somebody once so that i couldnt ever

again in that way ive tried -she
raised her head- i have martin tried
my best but  cant

  her last word was barely whispered
but he hinched as if from a blow
is that final elinor

  shemodded she could not trust her-
self to speak he drew a long breath
then put out his hand

   will you seal the bond he said
slowly  of our-friendship 

  she put her band in his with the
knowledge that tears were in her voice

  martin she said good old mar-
tin  

  lie sat down again crossing his
hands on his knees and shaking off with
visible effort the burden of his depres-
sion

   oh he said  ive grown gray in
the service elinor

 and  ve given you-starvation
wages martin it hasnt paid has it 
she tried to speak lightly but over
the glow of her joy had crept a shade
she cared for martin in a very real way

  he nodded smiling his broad un-
beautiful smile

   yes it has-just this moment would
pay if there had been nothing else to
be sure of a good womans friendship-
well its next to the-other thing

  a sudden realization of all the gen-
erous years of his self-imposed servitude
came to her and in the light of it she
felt she could keep no secret hid she
leaned over her hand fingering the
letter in her dress

   martin she said slowly  lloyd is
coming home
lie started

   lloyd derevan  

  yes she said lloyd derevan
something in the way she lingered
over the name made him turn a shade
paler

   and mrs derevan   he asked
  there was a moment of silenee-
   mrs derevan is dead

  a strange hush fell between them
she was only conscious of her letter as
he was only conscious of her his eyes
searching her face read enough to
make him steady the expression of his
own

   will it make-any difference to you
elinor
the argosy

 she smiled but her lips were trem-
 bling

  all the difference in the world

 he felt almost as if he had been in
 the confessional he looked at her a
 moment without speaking then he rose
 taking up his hat and cane

    his eyes were a trifle strained and
 there were lines about his mouth but
 he spoke indifferently

  theres going to be a meet at med-
 wood tuesday would you care to go  
 she hesitated her voice softened

    tuesday she said  lloyd comes
 she went on hurriedly the steamer

 gets in at noon and- she stopped

 constrainedly

 he held out his hand

  i know he said  dont trouble
 to explain ill drop in if i may to-
 morrow-just to indorse the bond
 and he smiled

 she was leaning back against the
 doorway looking away from him

  martin she said  i want you to
 keep coming just the same-always
 his face flushed

  ill come to-morrow he said
 evasively after that-the deluge
 he moved out into the hallway where
 he paused

  elinor are you quite sure of-your-
 self

 she looked up

  quite sure

  and of him-i mean of what he
 is

 she smiled

  big men are only boys grown up
 martin to know lloyd once would he
 to know him forever there-dont
 lets talk about it any more i cant
 ask you to be glad but i ask you not to
 be sorry about my gladness

 lie pressed her hand reassuringly
 no he said i cant quite be
  glad can i  the under dog you
 know-but if you are i can be-well
 lets call it content there good-by i
 must hurry along

 she turned to him impulsively

  martin therell be somebody better
 than i some day

 the ghost of a smile curved his lips
 will there he said  you were
 always hopeful elinor well well

 loo

  but as he left her she knew that to the
endhis home would be desolate unless

she filled it

  she went back into the empty room
the darkness had fallen quickly yet she
lit the lamp lingeringly-she had dwelt
so long in shadows

  she drew up a low chair and sat with
her arms across the table thinking

  perhaps not thinking so much as re-
membering she remembered those
early days of lloyds devotion and the
future that was to be all mist and moon-
shine and then she had gone abroad
for two years with her invalid mother
and come back alone to find him bound
to another

  he had accused her of forgetting and
told her that because of it he hadnt
cared much what might happen and so
he had married a girl from the west

  that first interview afterward had
been painful-she closed her eyes even
now she remembered that she had
had the strength to cut short his protes-
tations to keep her eyes dry and her
heart in the iron grasp of reason but
somehow he had left her with the im-
pression that he still cared-desperately
-and that things must go on so till
the end

  she had felt quite limp and nerveless
afterward-there had been several un-
avoidable meetings once at a dinner
once during a week-end visit and two
simple notes from her requesting the
return of her letters

  then came the blind jealousy of his
wife and after that a long gap-a blank
of six years-if years could be blank
that were filled with such conscious
suffering of remembrance

  through it all martin who knew
had been the one calming influence he
had helped her to catch up the broken
threads of her torn existence but the
warp and woof of her fabric had still
been gray-always gray a friend
can move mountains but not dry up a
dead sea

  and so the years had slipped bv

  as she counted them now she felt
a sudden unreasoning fear-had they
changed her too terribly  had she lost
the light of her eyes the color from her
hair would she be less dear to him
now that he could claim her
the space between



  she got up and went with lagging
steps to a mirror lighting a bracketed
candle as one who dreads to see and
yet must look

  the reflection calmed her she was
still young-the old edition of herself
in a larger reprint that was all

  she stepped back with visible relief
a sound of cab wheels rolling over the
asphalt drew her to the window part-
ing the curtains she looked out the
night was marshaling its host of stars
the warm moisture of spring lay on the
pavements

  the cab had stopped at her door

  she turned inquiringly as a maid en-
tered bearing a card on a silver tray
before she had fully mastered the mean-
ing of the name she heard a mans quick
step in the corridor

  as the maid retreated her expectancy
grew almost to be physical pain with
straining eyes she watched the doorway
it was here at last-this meeting of the
bridged-over years

  the next moment they stood facing
each other

   lloyd 

   my dear elinor 

  she felt as mary did confronted by
lazarus the grave-clothes still about
his head then her voice left her-her
lips hot and dry could form no greet-
ing only her eyes gave him the wel-
come he craved

  as his hand found hers she sank on
a divan trembling he explained in
broken sentences

   i took an earlier steamer-it was
beastly over there i lost at monte
carlo-and like a small boy  wanted to
get home away from it - i came straight
to you

  she hardly heard what he was saying
-tlie tumult of her jov seemed to be
killing her

  he leaned over and kissed her on the
lips passing his fingers across her fore-
head the caress left her weak-she
was like a sensitive lily alive to the
touch of the first despoiling hand at
last she sat up smiling tearfully

   oh fche said  i know what
heaven is-its a meeting-plaee for
parted souls lloyd oh lloyd-to
have you back again

  he laughed shortly

      	a

   you always were strong on eni-
mont elinor so youve missed me
thats pleasant i think  want you
now as  never did in those old days
you are like good wine-age has im-
proved you

  she flushed with pleasure to vie
weighed in the balances and not found
wanting

   lloyd she whispered  lloyd

   oh he said lightly u i was sure of
you elinor-thats why  wrote i
heard from the badgelys you were still
in the same place  met them at pisa-
after ethel died  roamed around a good
deal getting used to my freedom it
was sudden you know-she always did
things that way we were at a hole of
a place in nice when it happened i
did all i could-i tried to make up at
the end but it doesnt matter now
whether i did or not-im back with
you

  she was looking at him intently he
gave her a sensation of strangeness
his words she hardly heard-she was
so alive to the tones of his voice-listen-
ing for familiar cadences

  lie leaned back watching her

   the badgelys told me that you had
dropped out of society that was fool-
ish elinor you owe it to me to be
somebody they said your long-legged
lawyer friend still looked after you-he
was a clever fellow it was a wonder
you didnt marry him-i was out of the
way

  she looked up at him

  lloyd it was all  could do to be true
in the one way left to me

  he patted her hand

   what a dear little fool you were
of course  knew vou were true even

if i-

  he stopped abruptly

   oh she said  how the years have
cheated us 

  he nodded

   in more ways than one but well
pay them back elinor well live the
rest of our lives to the limit and well
cheat them in another way-by forget-
ting

  she stroked his hand

   dear she said  can one ever for-
get it seems as if my life has been
spent in remembering


the argosy

  he laughed

   thats the woman of it to forget
is a mans creed-he has to he lives so
intensely there are some things it
doesnt do to remember so he smokes
a cigar or plays a game and the ghost
is gone its as easy as that elinor
ill teach you lots of things

  she watched his eyes his lips as a
mother might watch a son grown up
and come home after many years
they were familiar and yet new lie
had the same trick of smiling the same
nervous gesture of pushing back the
waves of his hair but the boyish look
she remembered was gone his chin had
grown harder his eyes more restless

  as he looked back at her lie drew her
suddenly to her feet

   let me see you from all points he
said youre not pretty any longer
elinor-you are beautiful only your
mouth is too sad thats right smile
do you know ive a queer feeling with
you-as if i were giving my recording
angel an account of my sins yrou
wouldnt know if i skipped any would
you  

  she shook her head

   oh youve been good lloyd-you
have-ivealways -wanted you to be it
was the one prayer i could pray-i
couldnt ask to have you back i could

only-

  she paused her eyes moist at the re-
membrance of those nightly vigils those
tearless petitions coupled with his un-
spoken name

  his expression changed slightly his
eyes looked away from her

   would it have made any difference
he said carelessly if ihadnt been
good  

  she sent him u startled smile

   why lloyd- she began

  suddenly he faccd her

    elinor if i didnt want you so much
id make a clean breast of it all-not
that there is so much to tell one or two
dark spots besetting sins and so forth
he rose walking nervously up and
down the room she sat watching him
with parted lips her eyes troubled

  her silence brought him back to her
side

   you havent asked me to dinner 
he said  arent you going to  

  the intensity of her gaze softened

   oh she said  how careless of
me her voice was a trifle con-
strained  we dine at seven-it must
be nearly that now father is away
theres nobody but me-we can have it
together

  it was with a feeling of relief she
led the way into the dining-room the
hour had been so vital to them both

  she seated herself opposite him at the
round table

  under the light of the chandelier his
face looked older with darkened lines
under the eyes in spite of herself she
felt that she was watching him-watch-
ing for something she missed there
was an intangible difference that threat-
ened to level their love down to mere
acquaintanceship one cannot love the
unknown

  afterward when they were back
again in the lamp-lighted room she
knew it was the space between un-
accounted for-a shadow that stretched
over that backward way covering a
great void

  her hands on the cushioned arm of
her chair trembled he seemed sud-
denly a thing apart clothed with a ter-
rible strangeness-the strangeness of
change-of subtraction of multiplica-
tion of addition

  w ith a sudden fear she turned grop-
ingly to the past to drag from it some
familiar sign some bit of common sod
on which their feet could rest together

  she leaned toward him appealingly

   lloyd do you remember that day at
medwood years ago wrhen rou were
jealous of old mr olliver he died
last month 

  he lit a cigar casting the burned-out
match carelessly away from him

   ou seem mightily concerned he
said  perhaps i was right in being jeal-
ous but  shouldnt be now

   wouldnt you she asked

  he laughed

  not a bit not after the look of
your eyes when i came to-night it
made you mine forever-you gave your-
self up 

  she drew back

    one never gives oneself quite up
one reserves a part for-for friends
she finished weakly
the space between



  a vision of martins seriously kind
face confronted her she fell as if she
were smiting him between the eyes

   no she said  lloyd i make one
reservation- owe it to-others who
filled the years yon left empty

  there was a silence between them
he sent blue rings of smoke upward
his lips curving deliberately her eyes
were downcast but she felt his presence
in the room

  with a sudden rush of tenderness
she went over to him leaning oh the
arm of his chair

   lloyd she said tremulously  it
all seems-so strange i-hardly seem
to know you

  he half turned

  well he said ive changed
thats all the trouble is you havent
elinor a man goes through a mill-
he comes out different over there the
pace is rapid

  she felt a weighing sense of depres-
sion it was as if the yeast had been
left out of the bread of her joy she
looked wide-eyed at the tantalizing vis-
ion of an imperfect happiness she put
one hand on his hair

   lloyd she said tell me about
those years between

  he laughed a trifle harshly

    it wouldnt be pleasant hearing eli-
nor you see ethel comes into it-
and a few others i guess we had
better let it go as a blank

   but we cant she breathed
 there are shapes crowding into it i
cant tell you how but i feel almost as if
some of them were flesh and blood
they are separating you from me
lloyd

  he stared into the shadow

  you are romantic he said and
imaginative to such a woman as you
things would sound even worse no no
-well let sleeping dogs lie well forget
it

  its a mans creed she murmured
 never a womans

  he got up slowly

   well he said lightly   advise
you to make it yours at any rate there
-kiss me elinor 

   at the touch of liis lips the old love
for him came back she threw her
arms about his neck

   lloyd lloyd she sighed  its the
beginning and end of my dreams

  he loosened her clasp

  not the end elinor-leave that
out-an ending is a synonym for death
and im afraid of death 

  his words cast a shadow over her
she shuddered he walked across the
room nervously puffing at his cigar

   when ethel died he said  i felt
as if she were only going on ahead to
tell on me-to let them know that i had
cheated her to the last

  she sat down weakly

   cheated her lloyd   she asked
faintly

  he nodded

   i never loved her exactly but i pre-
tended i did-you have to with some
women after she found out she made
me keep it up-the pretense-to the
end but i knew she was scorning me all
the time

  elinor shivered

  poor little thing she whispered
poor little thing

  for pitys sake he cried dont
deal in cheap sentiment you did your
share toward it 

  she stood up her face pale

   i   she said  lloyd what do you
mean  

   just that he answered shortly
 you were as guilty as i-you were in
love with me-and i was her husband
something in elinors throat seemed
to be choking her it was with an ef-
fort she kept her burning eyes un his
face

   for shame she cried  lloyd for
shame 

	she stopped suddenly with a revul-
sion of feeling could it matter now
what he said or what he thought she
turned away her lips trembling

  he came swiftly to her side

   elinor forget it-ali i said some-
how it made me feel less in ihe wrong
if it seemed that you were in it too 
he tried to put one arm about her
waist but she drew away slowly she
went over to the window looking out
half-blindly the dark spaces of the
sky were set with stars but she did not
see-she was only conscious that she
had eaten of the tree of knowledge and
that the fruit was bitter
tiie argosy

   she pressed one hand against her fore-
head and closed her eyes thinking the
tumuli of her thoughts hurried her on
to one inevitable conclusion it had
been there from the first but onl now
did she realize it-that there was a pain-
ful way which she must walk in alone

  she turned with no haste her eyes
seeking his held him

    lloyd she said faintly  there is

no bridge

  he stood in the center of the room
looking at her lie was like a prisoner
at the bar of her judgment llis face
under the lamp-light took on weaker
lines

  im afraid i dont understand he
said stiffly  you deal in riddles eli-
nor

  she crushed the window curtain in
cue white hand

   there is no bridge she repeated
hurriedly  i cannot come to you-
you can never come to me-there must
always be the space between  

  the spell of a pregnant silence held
them both ii is eyes shifted then he
looked over at her boldly

    what are you trying to get at  he
said sharply  do you mean that you
have ceased to love me  

  she shook her head

    i still love you lloyd-that part of
you that is dead and buried in a grave
the part that lives still belongs to
ethel and those others

  he laughed harshly

  you talk wildly elinor the
dead have no claim ethel-god am
 never to be rid of her 

  she passed her hand wearily across
her eyes

   lloyd she said shiveringly  we
must be plain-we must understand
as you cheated ethel you have cheated
me i have clung all these years to a
wraith a memory-to something that
had ceased to exist-and to find it out
is the bitterest thing i have ever
known

  lie stepped uncertainly toward her
his mouth had taken on cruel lines

  and what of me-what of me
must i cross the world to you for noth-
ing tell me that

  she put out one hand
  a there is a sea between us still she

sobbed  oh lloyd cant you see it i
we are so far apart-so far apart 
lie caught her wrist holding it firmly
are you sending me away he
asked do you mean that dont
be afraid-fm not sure that i even wish
to stay you send too big a flashlight
over my soul 

  she didnt answer him her eyes were
drinking in every detail of the once-
loved face for the last time

  at length she leaned over

  lloyd she said very gently do
you mind-going now

  he dropped her hand in the gesture
was final relinquishment it was like let-
ting a curtain fall between them when
he spoke it was from the other side

    perhaps he said  it is as well so
good-night elinor-and good-by
she stood in the daze of a broken
dream as his footsteps sounded down
the length of the hall

  when the door closed she shuddered
and awoke

  there were no tears in her eyes she
felt only a sense of desolation-of lone-
liness-as one feels when the dead have
been taken away then with dragging
feet she left the room

   a little later as she tossed on a sleep-
less bed she heard her father come in
the sound of his key in the latch
brought her the homely comfort of a
familiar thing-she realized at the mo-
ment that lowers grow on graves with
the thought she tried to curtain the
painful vision of the evening as he
passed her door he called to her

   elinor are you awake they kept
me late at the davisons martin was
there and  heard news-lloyd dere-
van is coming back 

  yes she said i know good-
night  

  she pillowed her head on her arm
staring into the darkness

  martin she sobbed martin will
understand 

  the morning found her calm and
heavy-eved her grief had worn itself
out but she felt like a thing left deso-
late by the sweep of some storm-site
must begin all over again-everything

  it was difficult the trivialities of
the household irritated her the shrill
voices of the maids broke in upon the
the space between



silence of her endurance with rasping
insistency she turned instinctively to
the end of the day for the opportunity
for rest

  when at last it came it brought
martin she was sitting dully and
listlessly in a window-seat piled high
with languidly luxurious cushions
the candles had been lit and in the
cheerful halo that they cast no ghost
could venture-there was no ghost for
her

  lloyds image was receding far into
the dark and impenetrable background
-she only felt the soreness of her own
hurt-the consciousness of all that she
had missed

  as martin entered she motioned him
to his favorite easy-chair his face was
slightly graver his eyes preoccupied as
lie put away his hat and cane he looked
over

   its good-by to-night elinor im
going away

   going away  she faltered  why
martin-where  

  l ie drew off his gloves smoothing out
the barely perceptible creases he was
a methodic man

   well he said  im not exactly
sure where  shall go its partly
business-partly because  think it will
be for the best  thought of going out
to seattle-there are interests there
somebody else might manage but its
as well to go oneself

  she sat in a strained silence holding
herself in check not daring to think of
what his absence would mean to her-
for she knew now

  suddenly her nerves gave way-she
leaned her head back weak tears tilling
her eyes in a moment he was at her
side

   whv elinor-why my dear-what
is it  

  she caught one of his hands im-
pulsively in both of hers

  martin she sobbed oh martin
are you failing me too 

  he stood in a torture of absolute
embarrassment stroking her hand un-
certainly

   youre nervous little woman he
said but yon mustnt say that-im
too stupid to fail any one least of all

you i only know how to be loyal in a
jog-trot way 

  she held to him tightly as to a long-
lost hope

   dont go she said faintly
 dont go-its so terribly sad to be-
alone

  he stood over her his face falling into
shadow

   my dear he said gently  there
will be-others to fill my place-its
such an unimportant one 

  something in his voice sank into her
heart she sat up looking away from
him

   martin she said brokenly lloyd
came last night-and i sent him-
away

  in the hush that followed their eyes
met

   sent him away  he asked stupidly
 i dont-quite understand elinor
she stood up still clinging to his
hand

    dont myself she said wearily
 it was all wrong somehow-he was
different-we both were there was
that space between-i only realized it
then-that one can never go back one
must go on forever 

  he looked at her steadily

  you told him to go he asked
 loving him you told him that he
should go

   loving his memory she whispered
 i wanted to keep it sacred-because
he was dead-that was why

  suddenly he understood a light
swept over his face he trembled with
a strange hope

   thank god he said quietly
 thank god you found it out-in
time

  she eyed him wistfully

 and you wont go martin-now 
 not if you want me to stay elinor
her lips crept into a faint smile-she
wore the look of a child who had dried
its tears

   martin i think i shall want you-
always

   elinor 

   yes she said slowly  i mean just
that

  in the silence that followed he bent
down and kissed her

miss farrar wants to take my groom
the fugitive



imbarak and cross to the other side
of the river

  well why shouldnt she asked
the major if the raft will hold them
both  

    thats just what  said  exclaimed
may

   because replied mohun gravely
 imbarak tells me the other side is un-
safe that boars have occasionally been
found in the thickets there that the
footing is treacherous and that snakes
are not unheard of in the patches of
marshy ground but if miss farrar
really wants to cross and if you think
it safe sir i shall be glad to cross with
her

   so shall i broke in sir arthur
 id be jolly glad to escort her any-
where but if theres really danger
hadnt she better-

   i dont want the escort of either
of you thanks retorted may with
pretty wilfulness  i mean to be the
first of my party to explore the east
bank of the jordan imbarak doesnt
count he says he understands rafts
and he can shoo away any boars be-
sides ive got this -and she drew a
small revolver from her pocket-in
case of snakes or-

   if the snakes would only stand be-
hind you theyd fall read victims to
your skill as a markswoman laughed
the major but of course you can go
if you choose to ive no patience with
this talk of peril in the orient

   syria is as safe as jersey city
every traveler knows that robbers
dangerous wild animals and fanatics
were all cleared out years ago but
americans who come to the holy land
like to pretend they are in an atmos-
phere of peril

   it disgusts me this continual harp-
ing on danger danger danger cross
the jordan if you want to may if
youre sure imbarak understands hand-
ling a raft the worst danger youll in-
cur will be a spill into the water and
i think there are enough men here to
rescue you if you do upset

  but protested sir arthur it
would be beastly cold to tumble into the
jordan in winter do be careful miss
farrar

  there was a laugh at the baronets

serious tone and a second laugh at the
blank stare of surprise then with a
triumphant glance at mohun may
farrar left the group and beckoned up
a small wiry man in native garb

   imbarak she called loudly enough
for mohun to hear  get the raft ready
and we will cross now

   i-o-a sit  yes madam responded
the little brown man with alacrity - but
mr mohun  does he say i can go  i
am his groom

  may turned impatiently toward
mohun too proud to ask his leave but
he saved her the trouble by nodding
curtly at imbarak and then turning his
back on them both

  you spoke a few minutes ago sir
he said to the major  about the
absence of danger in syria you were
partly right of course but in all
eastern countries so i have read noth-
ing is certain except uncertainty and
syria is no exception

   of course the bedouins no longer
as a ride commit robberies openly in the
more settled districts here nor do
moslem fanatics openly kill christians
just to prove their piety but bedouins
are still thieves at heart and fanatics
only await the chance to kill every
christian within reach all that either
bedouins or fanatics need to make them
as dangerous as of old is a word of en-
couragement from high quarters

   but that word shall never be

spoken the sultan of turkey is-

   the sultan is a solitary isolated
man struggling vainly to reform and
build up a nation which ought to be the
richest on earth and which is the
poorest the pashas grind down the
peasantry and townfolk and send lying
reports to their masters of the countrys
condition the christians in syria
especially in damascus where we are
planning to go next week have pros-
pered under the just laws of the present
sultan and the local mohammedans are
discontented

  f theres a fairly well-defined rumor
that the authorities at damascus are
scared at the growing hatred against
the christians and that a clique of
nobles there are almost openly advocat-
ing a massacre and a general looting of
christians property the nobles have


the argosy

their eyes on the  unbelievers  wealth
and also want to make themselves pop-
ular with the rabble the authorities
fear the influence of the nobles with
the sultan and therefore they dare not
crush the threateued revolt with an iron
hand things are getting serious up
there i hear perhaps it might be
wiser to postpone-

   postpone our trip there cried the
major who had listened with incredu-
lous impatience  my boy youre talk-
ing arrant nonsense were living in
the latter half of the nineteenth century
and under the protection of the ameri-
can flag massacre rot

  but its true that fanatics from all
parts of islam are flocking to damascus
and bedouins from the syrian desert
and-

   if youre afraid to risk your life
there ralph said the major disgust-
edly  stay in the safer neighborhood of
jerusalem we should be sorry to lose
your society of course but we dont
want you to die of fright

   why man alive do you suppose id
take my niece to damascus if there was
an atom of danger or that id advise
the rest of our party to go there with us
if it were not perfectly safe absurd 

   i think you know that i dont fear
for myself said mohun rising from
the deck chair into which he had thrown
himself  but as to safety-well as sir
richard burton once said  there can
be no real security in the lands dark-
ened by the shadow of the prophet 

  he strolled away toward the river
bank where he stood watching imbarak
deftly guiding the raft through the
swirl of yellow waters toward a wide
strip of white sand on the opposite
bank

   pui sorry i spoke so harshly to the
boy said the major looking after
him  i shouldnt have pretended to
doubt his courage for if im any judge
of men lies as plucky and as square a
cluip as ever i saw but his talk of
danger riled me i trust madam he
went on turning to mrs sharpe  that
you are not alarmed at the prospect of
going to damascus with us

   why to be frank with you i am
replied the old lady  im a little timid
by nature  suppose and all this talk

of fanatics and bedouins and the
 shadow of the prophet  frightens me
but she added brightly im going
all the same it will be my only chance
for i must return to boston next
month

  so soon i thought you avere to
stay on this side of the atlantic until
summer

   i was but my mail that m gelat
sent on from jerusalem to-day has
altered my plans

  no bad news i hope 

   very bad  fear but its a longish
story and i wont bore you with it
nothing you tell me madam could
possibly bore me and there was a note
of reai feeling in the pompous tones
that brought a faint flush to her with-
ered check   beg that you will let me
know if i can be of assistance in any
way

   thank you major i appreciate
your words more than i can say my
news in brief is that the great banking
house of warren  co of boston is
in grave danger

   you dont say so i thought it was
one of the most solidly established
houses in america mark warren the
president of the bank was a chum of
mine in yale i havent seen him for
ten years but up to that time we were-
like brothers poor old mark

   you are wasting your sympathy on
him if the reports in my letter are true
it is thought that he or some member
of his firm has squandered in specula-
tion a large sum of money entrusted to
the banks keeping all my little for-
tune is involved and if the bank fails

i- but dont let us think of that i

only mention it to explain why i must
cut short my visit to the east my letter
was from a lawyer whom i know it
was delayed three weeks by the cholera
quarantine at port said i should have
received it nearly a month ago at the
time it was written the story of the de-
falcation was still hushed up but it is
probably public by now and the bank
may have gone to pieces for all  know
h i there were only some means of

getting news i-

  a cry from the farther bank au
answering shout and the sound of a
plunge iuto the water brought them
the fugitive



both to their feet sir arthur cole
who had strolled farther up the clearing
also turned and all three ran toward
the bank

  there one glance explained the entire
situation to the majors eyes sharpened
as they were by many campaigns and
surprises

  may farrar and imbarak had beached
their raft on the east bank and had
started across the wide strip of white
moist sand toward the higher ground
they had not taken a dozen steps when
both had sunk to the knees in the
treacherous footing

  the groom had at once recognized
the nature of the danger and had tried
to throw himself face downward on the
sand but his feet were already too
deeply embedded may not compre-
hending had struggled to free herself
with the inevitable result that she sank
at once to the waist in the white
shifting sands

  iinbaraks agonized face and his gasp
of quicksands told her the full
story of her peril and she cried wildly
for aid

  ralph mohiiii  the opposite bank
had for the moment turned his eyes
from the newly - landed explorers and
was watching a gnarled tree floating
down-stream but mays cry had scarcely
reached his ears when his coat waist-
coat and shoes were tossed oil and he
had leaped into the icy waters of the
j ordan

  with long overhand racing-stroke he
battled his way across the swift stream
aiming for a point higher up in order to
counterbalance the effect of the current
each stroke carried the upper half of his
body out of the muddy torrent

  logs branches and other floating
debris buffeted him cruelly but he
managed to keep his head clear of any
of these obstacles and each cleaving
stroke carried his muscular body nearer
the quicksands

  the major sir arthur and the serv-
ants meantime were rushing aimlessly
along the western bank in the vain
search for a boat and bellowing foolish
advice to the imperiled girl

  imbarak had ceased to struggle and
bin brown face took  a stoical dull
look the intense fatalism of the east

having laid hold upon his brain and
nerves

  may however her straining eyes fixed
on the alternately rising and sinking
face of the swimmer continued to
struggle fiercely as she felt the quick-
sands drawing her deeper and deeper
into its grip

  the jordan at no point wide is
barely two hundred feet from bank to
bank at the spot where tourists usually
camp it was thus but the work of a
minute for so expert a swimmer as
ralph moliun to reach the place where
the raft was beached scrambling on it
he bent his full strength to the task of
ripping off the broad boards that
formed its deck

  the raft was old the nails rusty and
in a moment he had torn four of the
boards free throwing them two by-
two upon the sands he sprang across
them to where mar buried almost to
the shoulders awaited him the wide
surface of the planks withstood the suc-
tion of the treacherous sand

  luckily in quicksand it is almost as
easy to draw forth an object emi-edded
as it is for that object to sink in
therefore a single tremendous pull of
ralphs powerful arms sufficed to lift
may from the moist quaking grave into
which she had so nearly lost her life and
to place her trembling and exhausted
on the planks beside him

  his arm still encircled her and for
one brief pregnant instant rescuer and
rescued looked into each others eyes

  in that look a knowledge a wonder-
ful certainty- passed from one to the
other

  through her exhaustion the girl felt
a wave of color surge to her face the
mans eyes glowed and darkened
neither spoke

  a cheer from the little group on the
opposite bank and the spell was broken
picking her up lightly in his arms
ralph moliun carried may to the
wreck of the raft set her down there
and bounded back to where imbarak
waited

  wresting the luckless syrian from the
clinging sands less gently than he bail
lifted may from them mohun deposited
the limp nerveless body on the planks

   come  he said sharply  brace


the argosy

up help me move these planks back
to the raft step on the next one anrl
then lift this one youre on now well
need them

  dully the native obeyed he had
been too near death to realize clearly
his unexpected deliverance

  working mechanically under mohuns
orders hegained the strip of safer sand
where the raft lay and set to work at his
task of repairing the rude vessel

  five minutes later the three were 
the west bank again may crying
quietly in mrs sharpes arms and
mohun looking very foolish as he re-
ceived the thanks of the much-flustered
major

   you showed pluck my boy the
older man was vociferating  and what
is better you showed presence of mind

it was a proof that-

   that there may still be a few dan-
gers even in syria queried ralph
innocently and the majors mingled re-
sentment and gratitude strangled the
reply in his throat

  but a diversion occurred to end the
embarrassing situation imbarak the
groom who had stood stupidly staring
across at the quicksands suddenw
turned and walked up to the tourists

  slowly unwinding his dirty white
turban the syrian laid it at mohuns
feet ignorant of eastern customs
ralph did not realize that this is the
world-old oriental form of vowing
eternal allegiance-not until the
grooms words enlightened him

   howajisaid imbarak simply  i
am your dog by the tombs of my
fathers by the sword of the prophet i
lay my life forever at your feet when
the hand of death was on me you lifted
me to life again another would have

i imbarak abou-najib

  the quiet simplicity with which he
spoke robbed the words of much of
their melodramatic effect yet with the
anglo-saxon hatred of demonstrative-
ness mohun looked and felt supremely
uncomfortable as he answered lamely

   oh thats all right glad to have
been able to do you a good turn let
the matter drop there 

  he walked away leaving the native to

pick up and resume his turban and to
mutter guttural prayers of gratitude in
his own dissonant arabic tongue

chapter ii

a surprise

  for two days longer the party re-
mained encamped beside the jordan
making little horseback trips to the
near-by ruins of ancient jericho to the
salt plains at the northern end of the
dead sea to that weird uncanny body
of water the dead sea itself  and to the
sites of the cities of the plain

  the whole valley of the jordan is full
of wonders of nature and of historical
and religious interest the americans
with the exception of two of their party
enjoyed the experience to the full

  these two exceptions were ralph
mohun and may farrar and the
reason for their lack of interest in out-
side environment was easy to under-
stand

  when ralph mohun had chanced to
meet miss farrar and the major
through having a seat at their table at
shepheards hotel in cairo a month
before both uncle and niece had taken
an instant liking to him on hearing
that he was on his way to the holy
land they begged him to join their
party hesitatingly he consented

  a frank friendship of rapid growth
had sprung up between the young fel-
low and may and had unconsciously on
both sides ripened into a deeper feeling
of whose nature and comprehensiveness
both had for the first time become
aware in that one moment of rescue on
the quicksands

  but since then to mays surprise and
chagrin the man appeared to avoid her
he seldom addressed her directly and
evaded all chances of a tete-a-tete

  at first may fancied this attitude on
his part might be accidental and she
was secretly grateful for the respite
wherein she might adjust her mind and
heart to this new and wonderful emo-
tion which springing into life in one
moment now filled and swayed her
whole being

  rut before the party turned their
laces toward jerusalem on the morning
the fugitive



oi the third day may farrar could no
longer doubt that mohuna new cold-
ness of manner and actual avoidance
of her were intentional

  that he was unhappy she could
plainly see that his disquiet had to do
with her she readily guessed

  woman-like and conscious of free-
dom from oifense she was too proud to
seek an explanation or to try to force
her society on a man who was obviously
seeking to avoid it

  thus it was that with unseeing eyes
the two young people gazed on scenes
fraught with the worlds most marvel-
ous history and most sacred religious
associations

  it is a days journey by fairly easy
stages from the valley of the jordan
to jerusalem part of the route lies
over a rough road laid in the days of
roman rule and little improved in the
past nineteen centuries and part lies
over a mere narrow rock-girt path
where carriages cannot pass and where
horsemen must ride single file

  the first portion of the journey is
through shaded orchards of olive
orange and lemon trees laden with
fruit and flower the latter part is over
a mountainous barren desolate tract
where dull-gray rock and duller brown
earth blend into a monochrome of
dreariness

  u it is like a land of the dead com-
mented mrs sharpe to the major who
rode beside her palanquin

   it is a land of the dead he an-
swered gravely  a land whose glory
is departed but there are more holy
memories roused by the outlines of
these barren hills and by the very dust
of these roads than by all the beauties
of the rest of the world

    this land is the cradle of our faith
 feel that with every step i take i am
treading on holy ground i only wish
he added with a sigh  that i could in-
stil a little feeling of the sort into our
young people here

  he indicated with his head sir arthur
and may who were riding together a
hundred yards in advance of their
elders laughing and ehatting gaily

  youth is youth responded mrs
sharpe oracularly  but evidently the
 triangular love affair is no longer tri-

angular where is mr mohun have
he and may had a tilt

  c  hope not  said the major turning
in his saddle to locate the missing
swain  for i like the boy id be sorry
if may had trifled with his heart to any
serious extent hes too good a chap for
her to torture there he is now riding
with imbarak nearly half a mile behind
us what ails tho lad on the journey
from jerusalem to the jordan he never
left mays side

   i wouldnt worry probably some
silly misunderstanding such a- young
people enjoy you seem fond of mr
mohun are you prepared to welcomc
him as a nephew-inaw  

   well id hardly say that you see
i know so little of him we met him
accidentally in cairo and liked him and
insisted on his joining us he is from
boston is recently out of harvard and
is spending a year in travel before set-
tling down to business thai is all he
has told me about himself he seems to
have plenty of spending money and
plenty of leisure and from his manner
i can see he is a gentleman by birth and
breeding

   thats all i really i-now of him if
he and may come to an understanding it
will of course be my duty as her uncle
and guardian to make strict inquiries
as to his family finances antecedents
etc but it has struck me that for the
past day or so he and may dont seem
as fond of each others society as of old
-ever since he helped her out of the
quicksands in fact queer isnt it  but
young cole is getting his innings on ac-
count of it

   ive lived in and around boston all
my life said mrs sharpe reflectively
 and i know by name or personally
nearly every family of any account in
the whole city but i recall no name
such as mohun nor though ive ques-
tioned him once or twice can i make
him speak of any acquaintances in bos-
ton besides ive noticed that though
we have all been together for more than
a month he has never received any mail
not a single letter

   nor have i ever seen him writing so
much as a postcard in the hotel writing-
rooms on steamer-days it is none of
my business and i suppose i am a pry-
the argosy

mg spying old woman but all this
strikes me as odd may  advise you in
ease affairs do come to a headto make
very strict inquiries before trusting that
dear little girls life and happiness into
his care 

   you may count on me said the
major stiffly but i believe and ear-
nestly hope that you are mistaken-if 
am any judge of faces and yet all you
say of his peculiarities strikes me as odd
now that i think it over well let s
hope it will turn out all right but im
sorry to have a doubt of ralph planted
in my mind for as i said im fond of
the boy let us talk of something else
please

  meantime mohun had some time be-
fore made a pretext of dismounting and
examining his saddle-girth with im-
baraks assistance and had thus allowed
himself to drop behind the rest of the
little cavalcade

   well he said to the groom as he
remounted you asked me to drop
back what did you want 

  to speak to you in private howaji
 may not get a chance at the hotel

   if it is any more of that nonsense

about your gratitude-

   it is not howaji but it is because
of that gratitude that i speak may 
proceed  

  the groom like many another mos-
lem in impoverished circumstances had
as a boy taken advantage of the univer-
sal opportunity which the american
college at beirut offers to natives to
secure an occidental education he
therefore spoke english with an almost
imperceptible accent and while cling-
ing to moslem faith and islam condi-
tions had acquired as much occidental
learning as the average american gram-
mar school graduate

   go on assented mohun  what is
it you wanted to tell me

   what i say i must ask you to regard
as secret sir have  your promise
mohun nodded carelessly his mind
and eyes on a trim slender figure in
close-fitting riding-habit half a mile
ahead

   i wish to warn you howaji not to
go to damascus and to beg vou to pre-
vent your friends from going

   then you believe this rumor of an

uprising against the christians
asked ralph with new interest

   believe it  i know it is true the
jtch-ul-llasoul brotherhood of the
prophet of which i am a member has
sent word to damascenes in every part
of syria to  come home to the feast

 am of damascus my mother lives
there in the street of the mehdan

   and you mean to say that this fra-
ternal crew of cut-throats is actually
sending out invitations to its members
to come and cut christians throats it

is the most-

  f do not judge howaji you are of
the west we of the east you cannot
understand the ukh-ul-rasoul is but
one of many guilds in damascus that
have suffered from the sultans weak
toleration of the christians the
nobles are behind us the serail local
government knows but cannot prevent
there will be killing and plundering
and burning  whose life is yours
warn you to stay south here where there
is safety

   and you actually intend to join in
this slaughter

  i no howaji i have learned the
education of the christian  have seen
that he is a good man and not a sorcerer
as my brethren believe while i do not
embrace his creed i honor and revere
it i shall take no part in the  feast 
 yet you will keep silence and let
innocent men-perhaps even women
and children-he murdered

  it is kismet howaji it is fate
their lives are in the hollow of allahs
hand it is not for me to speak be-
sides he added a practical note creep-
ing into his apathetic voice my breth-
ren would kill me with most unpleasant
tortures if i betrayed them

     e will not go to damascus i can
answer for that i suppose i ought to

thank you but-

    ihe major is calling howaji shall
we catch up with the rest 

  putting their wiry syrian ponies to a
gallop they swept past the baggage
mules laden with tents and chests
breasted the rise of the hill and joined
the tourists who were awaiting them
mohun tried to laugli off the majors
remonstrances at his long absence but
his mind was busy with plans for pre-
the fugitive



venting the proposed visit to ancient
damascus

  they rode into jerusalem tired
dusty and hungry at nightfall mohun
lingered for a word with imbarak as
the party dismounted in front of the
grand hotel the others passed on
into the terrace reception-room

     any new arrivals since we left land-
lord asked sir arthur as the portly
host greeted them on the threshold

   only one sir replied the boniface
an american gentleman-mr zcnas
shattuck of boston u s a

   another feilow-citizen of yours
mrs sharpe the major was beginning
gaily when a man who had been stand-
ing in the center of the wide room
slouched forward toward them

  lie was long rather than tall lean to
emaciation with enormous hands feet
and ears and a wrinkled grayish face
in whose narrow eyes and tliin-lipped
mouth a half-humorous shrewdness and
a tremendous fund of latent energy
seemed to dwell

  his keen glance swept the group and
there was a suppressed look of disap-
pointment on his leathery face as lie
ended the scrutiny

   heard my name mentioned he said
in an unmistakable  down-east 
drawl  let me make myself ac-
quainted im zenas shattuck of-

  he paused and turning suddenly
walked up to ralph mohun who was
just entering the room

    want you young man he said
laying his hand on the newcomers
shoulder

  ralph spun around as though gal-
vanized by the touch his eyes rested
on shattuck with a sort of horrified fas-
cination as the latter opened his thin
lips to speak again

  but the words never left them for
shaking off the momentary apathy of
amazement mohun drove his left fist
full into the others face

  the long lean man reeled backward
with the velocity of a catapult caromed
against a table and tumbled heavily to
tlie floor upsetting a chair and a bric-a-
brac-covered taboret in his fall before
the prostrate victim could make a move
to rise before the amazed spectators
could move or speak ralph mohun with

a single bound had reaehed the long
french window leading out into the
hotel gardens

  he tugged fiercely atthe knob then
putting his shoulders to the sash burst
the stout fastenings and leaped out into
the darkness a shower of glass clatter-
ing to the polished iloor behind him

  zenas shattuck revolver in hand
sprang through the wrecked window in
hot pursuit

chapter iii

i-v the garden of sorrows

  in speechless astonishment the four
tourists looked from one to another of
their number each seeing reflected in
the nearest face the blank amazement
of his own

cole was the first to break silence

   our friend mohun seems to be-er

-wauled as the london bobbies say
he remarked dazedly  what the
deuce do you suppose lies done that
chap was a detective ill bet a fiver

  s o one answered old mrs sharpe
with feminine intuition came closer to
miss farrar and slipped an arm about
the trembling girls waist she felt
mays heart beating tumultuously and
knew what that moment of suspense and
shock must mean to her

 the embarrassing interval was
broken by the return of zenas shattuck
he reappeared in the broken window-
frame muddy and bruised from several
tumbles in the dark garden his forehead
bleeding slightly from ralph mohuns
blow and his whole aspect the picture
of rough usage and disorder

  but the white blaze of rage in his
little blue eyes the wrath and pallor of
his sallow leathery face drew attention
from mere details of costume

   did you catch him   asked sir
arthur with cheerful fatuity

   yes snarled shattuck savagely
 of course ive got him here in my
pocket any fool could see that

   i-i suppose youre a detective 
faltered sir arthur his anglican mind
groping for a hidden meaning in shat-
tucks words

   and  spose youre an english-
man snapped zenas and that shows
how all-fired smart we both are
the argosy

s

   my friend sir arthur cole did not
intend to annoy you mr sliattuck 
said ihe major eonciliatingly  ia

i introduce myself  i am major craw-
ford of new york you must pardon
us for seeming inquisitive you see
the man who has just escaped ihrougn
no fault of yours i am sure-was a
friend of ours we have traveled for
some time with mr mohun and--

   mr who broke in the detective
  mr mohun-mr ralph mohun-

the man-	

    so thats the name is it  growled

zenas

   why what other  do you mean
he was traveling under an alias

   what i mean or what i dont mean
i no concern of anybodys but mine and
his hes the man im after all right
ive seen him often enough in boston to
know him and ill get him too even
if he has given me the slip for the min-
ute in that measly black garden out
there oh ill tttfhim right enough 

   wont you tell us with what crime
he is charged constable   asked cole
easterly

    no  wont is that plain enough 
its none of your business ive got a
warrant for him and   get him thats
enough for you to know if id had
sense enough to communicate first with
the chief of police here instead of
trying to be a smart alec and play a
lone hand id never have let him slip
 do you know babbled cole his
monocle sweeping the group with be-
nevolent triumph  ive always had my
suspicions of that mohun always said
to myself he was a queer johnny hed
never talk about himself you know
always distrust a chap that wont talk
about himself now i am always glad

to talk about myself i-

   im afraid you were right mrs
sharpe in the suspicions you voiced to-
day said the major sadly i blame
myself bitterly for being taken in by the
fellow and yet he seemed so straight-
forward so gentlemanly 

     oh dont talk of my wretched sus-
picion-  cried the poor old lady cast-
ing a frightened glance at may who at
her uncles words drew quietly away
from the elder womans protecting arm
 dont talk of my wrctched suspicions

im i bad-hearted old creature ever to

have had suck thoughts or to have
spoken them no doubt i was utterly
mistaken he may dear himself yet
not he retorted the major with
sorrowful conviction  an honest man
doesnt take to his heels when accused of
crime or when accosted by a detective

    but he may have lost his head

    the man who had coolness and pres-
ence of mind enough to plan and carry
out the rescue of may and the groom
from the quicksand isnt likely to lose
his head under a lesser emergency no
no im the last man who would have
believed in his guilt if he hadnt given
ample proof of it by running away

   always suspected him queer
johnny  supplemented sir arthur

chuckling

  if youll excuse me uncle said
may  i think ill go to my room im
very tired

  zenas sliattuck looked keenly after
the departing girl noting the drooping
liues of her figure and the set hopeless
look on her white face

   the only one of the whole crowd
that hadnt something to say against
him he muttered under his breath
 shell bear watching

	   

  early the following morning may
farrar came down into the terrace-
roorn the hotel was silent and the
lower floors deserted in the gray of the
syrian dawn

   the girl had passed a sleepless mis-
erable night the indoor air suffocated
her

  she dreaded meeting her friends at
the breakfast table to hear their com-
ments on her pallid complexion and
black-ringed eyes she felt that she
must get out of doors-anywhere-by
herself to think matters over and to
get a fresh grip on her shattered nerves

  throwing a wrap about her shoul-
ders-for the morning was as chill as
the noon would be hot-she passed the
sleeping porter and let herself out into
the narrow street

  the thoroughfare was empty on
the roof of the gray tower of david
directly opposite a drowsy turkish sen-
tinel paced turning to the right may
walked rapidly toward the jaffa gate
the fugitive



  even the walled confines of the holy
city seemed to oppress her she
wanted to be in the open country of
jerusalems six modern entrances the
jaffa gate lies nearest to the grand
hotel the warder had just opened it
for the day as may appeared

  the stolid syrian stared open-
mouthed at the unprecedented specta-
cle of a woman walking abroad alone
and at dawn grumbling something to
himself about the  madness of all
feringhl  foreigners he watched her
as she struck out with the free grace-
ful stride of the anglo-saxon pedes-
trian along the by-road that skirts the
citys walls to the north

  jerusalem long ago outgrew its walls
and the overflow lias spilled in dis-
orderly fashion to the west and south
of the city in the shape of all sorts of
irregular untidy structures from pack-
ing-box shanties to mud and stucco
community buildings to the north and
the east the holy city cannot spread

  the deep and precipitate sides of the
valley in whose center lies the brook of
kedron and whose farther slope culmi-
nates in the mount of olives cut off
further building on the east while a
mohammedan cemetery and irregulari-
ties of ground render growth almost
equally impracticable on the north

  with this conformation vaguely in
mind yet half-unconscious as to her
direction may farrar rounded the
northwestern buttresses of the gray old
walls and turned east toward kedron

  scavenger dogs prowled in the ditch
at the base of the wall an occasional
peasant leading a donkey laden with
wares or the mornings market passed
may in the narrow road and eyed her in
stupid wonder but her self-possession
and the absence of all furtiveness from
her manner served almost as effectively
as did the dumb misery in her face to
avert insult

  she moved on unmolested this slen-
der sad-eyed american girl where a
woman of any race save the anglo-
saxon would have been subjected to a
thousand perils

  only once she paused she was op-
posite the damascus gate and stopped to
gaze for an instant at a low skull-shaped
hillock just north of the ditch-road

  the little hill was dotted by a number
of graves and in its sides were the scars
of abandoned quarries the summit
presented the one green spot in all that
dreary grayish landscape

  it was in a cave at the base of this hill
that gordon discovered the tomb and
other evidences which led him and a
large portion of the christian world to
identify the spot as the real mount cal-
vary the presence of moslem graves
on the sacred hill have prevented its
demolition before the encroachment of
building enterprises

  the sun rising over the mount of
olives gilded the green crest of calvary
as the girl gazed reverently she
bowed her head and stood thus a mo-
ment in silence before hurrying on

  a long string of mangy mouse-
colored camels laden with bales and  d
by a furrv little gra donkey was toil-
ing up the steep hill leading from
kedron as may began her descent and
she stood aside to let the ugly brutes
and their grinning shouting drivers
pass

  then she picked her way along the
stone-strewn dusty highway to the
valley below later in the day the
dried bed of kedron brook at this point
would be alive with traffic discordant
with the yells of vendors and infested
by loathsome lepers and other more or
less unsightly mendicants

  but now over the whole scene brooded
the solemn peace and hush of the
dawn the mount of olives loomed up
before her somber and beautiful
about its lower slopes clustered olive
orchards and the white walls of monas-
teries

  breasting the slope may checked
herself to look in through the wide-
open gates of a walled garden wind-
ing natural paths intersected the neg-
lected flower-sprinkled turf and
enormous gnarled ancient olive trees
cast a soft shade along the reaches of
swaying grass

  the whole enclosure breathed of
peace repose silence

  passing through the gateway may
farrar eutered the garden here for
the fust time her restlessness vanished
a mystic sense of calm crept over her

  the tension of the past twelve hours
 foliage of
 far



relaxed throwing herself face down-
ward in the long soft grass the girl it
to sobbing softly and with the teaib

came peace

above in the gray-green
the olives birds were twittering
in the distance the voice of a muezzin
priest calling the faithful to morning
prayer came faintly to her ears  oice
after voice from the distant city caught
up the call as from minaret to minaret
the muezzins sent forth their sonorous
chanting summons

 allah-hu-akbar la malt illah -m 
mah mo ad s iadnah raso u i a hah

    light step on the gravel path near
by broke in on the girls grief and she
sprang hastily to her feet

   before her his face swathed m the
folds of a brown silk icafieh native head-
dress stood a syrian some distance
behind him in the gateway of the gar-
den a second native was waiting may
at a glance recognized the farther man
as imbarak the groom

   despite the icafieh which shrouded the
face and the long-striped abbieh and
kurnbaz which muffled the figure of the
nearer native there seemed something
familiar about his bearing

   what-what do you want she
faltered in english

   then as he did not answer her at
once she repeated still more nervously
in french

    que voulez-vous 

   a shake of the head and the icafiehs
folds fell away from the mans face

    ralph mohun  cried may incredu-
lously

   mohun his bronzed face dyed to an
even deeper shade of brown his dark
mustache shaved his muscular figure
disguised in the shapeless costume of
a native syrian of the better fellaheen
class might have walked unrecognized
through a double line of his closest
friends but the eyes of love are keen
and at a glance may farrar knew him

   surprise was her first emotion then
followed a feeling of anger against the
man who all unworthy had won her
love and had caused her such suffering

   it was mohun who spoke first

   imbarak supplied me with this

the argosy

dress he began lamely enough and
he got me the dye for iny face  here
are so few americans m syria that 
would have been captured in a day if i

 hadnt disguised myselt

  lc why do you tell me this she
asked coldly finding her voice at last
 it can be of no interest to me

    did not venture to hope it would
 interest you he answered  i only
 spoke of  it to explain my odd appear-
 ance	

   it needed no explanation but
something else does and that is your
motive in addressing me after -

after--

    after last nights scene he sup-
 plemented you are right miss
 farrar my venturing to address you
 at all or to claim acquaintanceship with
 you under such circumstances surely
 requires an explanation believe me it
 was not from an idle whim that  fol-
 lowed vou here

   on second thought mr mohun i
do not care to hear any explanation you
may offer please dont detain me any
longer  must get back to the hotel
but he barred the path she looked
at him in astonishment

  i shall only detain you a moment
he pleaded  and i must ask you to
hear me out  should not trouble you
with any affairs of my own please
believe that but this concerns your
own safety

   she stood still without replying and
 he continued

  the major intends to take you to
damascus in a day or two he must
not do so this is imperative had i
remained with your party i should have
found a means to prevent it as it is
i can only appeal to you for your own
sake not to go there is the gravest
sort of danger awaiting all christians-
native and foreign alike-at damascus

    i tried to make your uncle under-
 stand this but he would not he may
 believe you if he does not you must
 feign sickness or resort to any subter-
 fuge to avert the trip your life and
 the lives of the whole party may hang
 on this

    oh cant you see i would not have
 risked detection and capture by linger-
 ing near jerusalem until this morning
the fugitive



 if it had not been necessary to give you
 this warning and if tlie warning had not
 concerned your very life

  he spoke with an earnestness that
for the moment carried conviction
whether or not his warning was justi-
fied may felt that he had indeed im-
periled his liberty by remaining to
deliver it and a quick revulsion of
feeling seized her as she looked up into
his troubled eager eyes

  mr mohun-ralph she ex-
claimed laying her hand impulsively
on the coarse sleeve of his isumbaz
 forgive me it i judged you too harshly
i was wrong to condemn you without a
hearing tell me the truth about your-
self perhaps  can help you

  a spasm as of pain twisted his brown
dyed face and a light sprang iuto his
haggard eyes as he listened he opened
his lips to speak then checked himself
as if by a tremendous effort the
perspiration stood out on his forehead

  a terrible struggle seemed waging
within him but when he spoke again
his tone was dull and hopeless and his
eyes were averted from the pleading
beautiful face upraised to his

   i can tell you nothing he said
but you dont understand she
insisted   am ashamed of myself that
i ever doubted you even for a moment
if you had stood your ground last night
none of us would have believed that
wretched yankee detective oh why
did you run away it was so-so unlike
you

  i i can tell you nothing he re-
peated dully

   you must  she cried stamping her
foot with pretty insistence  cant
you see ill believe whatever you say-
thal ill knoiv youre speaking the
truth-that i trust you all you have

to say is  i am innocent and-

   i cannot say it

  the words were spoken so low that
she scarcely caught their import but
the droop of the mans head the utter
misery and despair of his countenance
went straight to mays tender heart

  she could not-would not-believe
him the guilty wretch that his face his
bearing his words implied she made
one final effort to break down his re-
serve

      	a

  ralph mohun she said more
quietly  i know little of the world as
men sec it-little of the temptations and
pitfalls that beset a man so it is not
for me to judge you but this i do
know  if you have been led into any folly
or lawless act-i will not believe you
capable of crime-the only honest and
manly course open to you is to go back
and bravely face the consequences of
that act not to hide from its results
do that and whatever your punishment
 for one will be proud to call you my
friend and to help you by every means
in my power

  she checked herself for as she had
spoken his face had gone ghastly white
under its coat of tan

 with inarticulate murmur his
parched throat sought to form words
of reply

  you are suffering she went on
with a thrill of quick sympathy in her
hurried words  it would make it
easier for you to tell me everything i
might help yot the mouse set the
lion free from the net you know

and-

  the man had regained control of him-
self his face was calm his voice ex-
pressionless as he broke in

   i need not tell you miss farrar
that it would be sweet beyond words to
me if  might confide in you-if in
other words i might be cur enough to
roll my own load of responsibilities upon
your shoulders

  but there are reasons which i i aunot
explain that forbid my taking advantage
of such a chance even could i bring
myself to do so i repeat  can tell you
nothing and unfortunately  cannot
even act on your advice to give myself
up you will of course attribute this
latter determination on my part to cow-
ardice

  the cold studied brutality of his tone
struck the girl like a blow in the face
dampening her ardor chilling her zeal
in his behalf

   then she said slowly  am  to

believe- 

  you are to believe what you will
he replied the same forced coldness and

the aegosy

trude on you no longer i can only
thank you for all your kindness to me
for the faith you have tried to have in
me for the oniv words of hope and kind-
ness that i shall perhaps ever hear

   you avoided me after you saved my
life at the jordan why
ee i cannot tell you

   had i offended you in any way  
you no you could never of-
fend me

   oh why make a mystery of all this 
why not be honest with me isnt
there enough suffering enough sorrow
in the world without needlessly causing
more  

 enough sorrow and suffering
echoed mohun with a mirthless laugh
 oh theres enough of both il you
came here to forget them you chose a
strange place for the purpose

   do vou know he added his cynical
tone changing to one of reverence  do
vou know what garden this is  

 no
   it is gethsemane 

   gethsemane  

   the garden of sorrows was it by
chance you came here  

   yes she spoke with a certain
awe recalling the mystic feeling of sur-
cease from pain that had stolen upon
her the moment her feet had crossed
the threshold of the enclosure

   and now resumed ralph after a
pause  i must go i shall probably
never see you again there is much i
would say to you if i had the right but
i cannot even ask you to think gently of
me so let us say good-by i suppose
you dont care to shake hands with
me  

  the appeal in his tone strangely
enough awakened her slumbering in-
dignation

   how can you ask it  she said bit-
terly you imposed yourself on us
accepted our friendship and became a
member of our party without stopping
to consider the disgrace and mortifica-
tion that might accrue to us when the
exposure came and when we should be
known as the dupes and associates of a
felon

   i have appealed to you this morning
-lowering myself to plead with you as
i never thought i could with any living

person i have begged you to be honest
with me you owed unit at least to me
and to all of us you refuse

   i have implored you to return and
face the consequences of your act as any
man with a spark of honesty and cour-
age should you refuse i have no
alternative but to believe the worst of
you dont you know yourself that
an honest man could not act as you are
doing 

   yes assented mohun heavily  
suppose he couldnt and now if you
have quite finished may i go

from pity to contempt

  the reaction from may farrars
burst of righteous anger had set in she
was half-inclined to beg his forgiveness
for the harshness of her judgment yet
had he not even now by his reply ac-
knowledged the justice of that judg-
ment 

  the memory of his face as he had
looked into her eyes when his strong
arms snatched her from death in the
quicksands recurred to her with vivid
distinctness

    spoke cruelly she said with im-
petuous haste  i forgot for the mo-
ment that i owe you my life i ask your
forgiveness

   there is nothing to forgive he re-
turned and if you feel you owe me
anything for what happened at the jor-
dan you can at once cancel the debt and
make me happier by forgetting the
whole occurrence

   i can never forget it she faltered
instinct and logic warring within her
and with the usual result

  she sank on her knees in the deep
grass buried her face in her hands and
broke into a passion of weeping

   dont for gods sake dont  he
implored brokenly  im not worth it
im not worth it i tell you 

  he bent with outstretched arms as
though to gather her to his heart but
by a mighty effort at self-control for-
bore

  a strand of her gold-brown hair had
become loosened and fell across her
heaving shoulders glinting and shim-
the fugitive



mering a the morning sunbeams danced
through it

  ralph mohun dropped on one knee
lifted tiie stray lock reverently unob-
served by the weeping girl and pressed
it once twice thrice in silence to his
lips

  then he rose and said once more in
a voice that he strove in vain to render
conventional

   good-by miss farrar

  a quick patter of slippered feet along
the gravel behind them caused mohun
to turn nervously and brought may to
her feet

  imbarak came hurrying toward them

   howaji he cried breathless with
fear hide yourself it is too late
to go out by the gate and there is no
other exit

 whats the matter asked
ralph

   that tall man the detective you
told me had crossed the seas to find you
he is coming hide 

   shattuck  gasped mohun in
alarm

   yes  saw a man in feringhi
clothes standing in the valley he
seemed to be waiting for the sit he
was too far away for me to see his face
but he started this way just now as if
he was tired of waiting and then i
recognized him hide liowaji ah it
is too late 

  a long shadow fell across the gateway
and zenas shattuck looking even more
emaciated and gray of face than on the
previous night slouched into the gar-
den

  may farrar glanced keenly at mohun
and read in his face a panic-fear that
changed her grief to a quick contempt
that one human being should thus
shrink in dread of another filled her
with disgust and robbed her of her one
remaining vestige of pity for the cower-
ing man before her

  m mu time shattuck after one com-
prehensive look among the shadows of
the- garden strolled forward to where
may and the two men stood lie noted
her attitude of repulsion toward the
nearer of the two supposed natives

   these heathens botherin you miss
farrar he drawled as he came up

  mohun cowered at the voice raising

his hands to his face as if expecting a
blow

  but may her eves still fixed on him
noted that the gesture was made for
the purpose of drawing one of the long
silken ends of the jcafieh across his face

  but ralphs next move struck her
dumb with astonished disgust

  extending his lean brown hand
humbly toward her mohun whined
cringingly

   baksheesh sit baksheesh  in the
true syrian beggar accent

  gee vociferated shattuck it
does beat all how these dirty eastern
beggars can pester one i spose he saw
you come in here alone and thought he
could scare you into giving him money

  here you turning threateningly
on the cringing mohun  get out o
here  git before i break this umbrella
over yer heathen head whats he got
his face all bundled up for i wonder 
he added curiously taking a step toward
the supposed beggar

  may gasped but ralph desisting
from his plea to her addressed himself
to shattuck never faltering for a sec-
ond before the others shrewd scrutiny
baksheesh howaji he whined in
raucous coughing accents  baksheesh 
abras abras alms i am a

   whats he jabbering about now 
snorted shattuck

 a speculation in shirts

by l h bickford

what the difference between the lucky and the only dollar meant to sowders and how be
contrived to turn a foolish investment into a bonanza

siding who had come to shoot the under
sheriff

sowders passed up tontic avenue in
the best of humor a man who had a
mission to kill did not then interest him
why ugly death as an amusement when
there was gold to be had in the lucky
dollar and a place to put the gold into
circulation-many places for that mat-
ter since the crystal palace was dupli-
cated everywhere up and down the
street 

he entered the maze of them and
there were more toasts then out then
in and so on until-and here our story
begins-he was come to the shining
front of the levi brothers  gents
furnishing store the rendezvous of
male fashion in tontic the mart of
neckties and other fripperies

the lures of the levi brothers were
in two large windows in one was a
stiff gentleman of faultless form who
wore a pepper-and-salt suit of clothes
a derby hat and patent leather shoes-
an effect that might be reproduced in
toto for the inconsiderable sum of
thirty dollars and seventy-five cents
this glass of fashion was companioned
bv a woodenv child whose seven-dollar
sailor suit was the bargain blazoned
upon the sign in the window

these figures did not comprise all the
enticements a glass jar containing
beans sat on a field of pink-and-blue silk
handkerchiefs this was a game he
who came nearest to guessing the num-

as to whether sowders was a fool of
luck or a great financier there has
long been a division of opinion in ton--
tic it is however certain that he im-
pressed himself on the community

  the circumstances of his arrival are
obscure for he was merely an addition
of one to the changing population we
first hear of him in the chronicles of the
time-and they are now more or less
legendary-on a night in january when
the crystal palace was filled with the
light and life of the mining camp

  he entered it-according to report-
like a breeze from the snow hills in
one hand he held an assay certificate
and in the other a large sum of money
he was but a head taller than the bar
and when all there had been summoned
about him he stepped upon the seat of
a look-out chair that be might not be
lost in the crowd gathered to accept his
invitation of cheer

 there he stood a while the crowd
constantly augmented and anon he
lifted his glass toasted the lucky dol-
lar mine and called on all to witness
that an assay ticket did not lie many
toasts followed until in the end
sowders rolled down from his perch and
stumbled out into the street to leave
those that hung on the fringes of ton-
tic night life in other hospitable hands

  crystal palace diversions were varied
and when sowders was gone he was pres-
ently forgotten in the excitement of-
fered by the arrival of a man from bull
a speculation in shirts



ber of beans in the jar-provided he
had previously purchased one dollars
worth of goods-received at a stated
time and after the beans had been
counted the large gold watch that lay
in a velvet case at the feet of the gen-
tleman in the pepper-and-salt suit and
here also were colored ties jeweled
scarf-pins glittering studs and buttons
and checked hose

  sowders leaning for support against
a watch-makers post contemplated the
glories in the levi windows for some
minutes his eyes traveled from the
pepper-and-salt suit to the bean jar
from the sailor boy to the golden but-
tons

  they lingered for a time on the velvet
case and finally they fell to the least
of these things-so far as their vogue in
tontic went-a box of shirts whose stiff
white bosoms glittered under the gas-
light soavders moved forward

  in all his life this prospector-tramp
wearily going by trail from camp to
camp delving now here now there now
winning now losing had never owmed a
white shirt with a stiff shiny bosom
until that moment he had never con-
sidered white shirts desirable but with
that assay certificate clutched in his left
hand the white shirts opened a new life
to him

  lie saw himself sitting in the rotunda
of the windsor hotel in denver his
shirt bosom shining as it rose from a
waistcoat of scarlet at his collar a
string-tie of solemn black

  the vision was not impossible of real-
ization the assay certificate told him
that

  sowders opened the door and went in
he was not at this time entirely articu-
late but young mr abram levi the
younger member of the firm had keen
understanding

  in a trice he surrounded his customer
with a mountain of shirts they over-
flowed from blue boxes with their tissue
paper surroundings their bosoms
gleamed and shone and it seemed that
their white arms reached up in suppli-
cation

  sowders was bewildered he had
wanted one white shirt- young mr
levi had tempted him with all there
were in stock

  sowders wavered the pity of it to
take one lone shirt from its fellows
when all seemed eager to become the
property of the discoverer of the lucky
dollar the injustice of it to leave
these brother shirts to their eventual
fate as part of the apparel on the re-
gardless form of afaro dealer or the
man in the look-out chair

  sowders made a sudden resolution

   i want em all said he to young
mr levi all-each an several you
call a spresa wagon

  within ten minutes the store of the
levi brothers war destitute of white
shirts and within a half-hour sowders
was sitting on the seat of an express
wagon rolling happily along toward the
lucky dollar mine

  the driver turned now and then to
glance back at the boxes after which he
would crack his whip and whistle it
was odd but a fare was a fare and a
job was a job and all sorts of people
came to tontic

  for two days the world was a mist to
sowders on the third day he was
awakened to a sense of the gauntness of
life and of the uncertainties of the
future

  luck deserted him and without seem-
ing reason the cup of dreams was
snatched from him there had been a
hideous mistake at the assay office the
certificate he held was that of another
the owner of the only not the lucky
dollar

  when he had obtained his own card
it told nothing of stored riches there
was to be sure a trace of lead in the
samples he had left but--

  the hollowness of the error caused
him to hasten from the assay office be-
fore the chemist had concluded his
apology for the blunder xo apology
could reconcile sowders to the situa-
tion of not being a prospective million-
aire and more than this he had
squandered in premature celebration the
cash stake he had been so long accumu-
lating against his tontic venture

  he went back to his tireless grubless
and necessarily cheerless cabin piled
high with white stiff-bosomed shirts
and as lie contemplated the symbols of
his extravagance as the picture of him-
self in the lobby of the windsor hotel
the argosy

faded he sat on the side of his bunk

and groaned aloud	-	

  and it was then as if the snow long
was moved to pity for the spendthrift
that the heavens shook great white
flakes from lowering clouds and covered
the earth the enow fell for days until
tontie eighty miles from a railway sta-
tion ten thousand feet above sea-level
approachable only by winding roads up
the mountainsides found itselt cut oft
from the great world without

  a year before when the camp was in
the first bloom of its youth a similar
incident had not concerned any one
tontic had been snowbound for twenty
days and had survived it would doubt-
less survive now even if its supply of
fresh meat was not forthcoming the
tin can of civilization was here for the
tin can ever accompanies the advance
to the frontier

  the tontic commissary-stocked
against just such an emergency with the
all-seasonable things that come in tins
square and circular tins oblong and
flat tins gaily covered or merely
stamped-would serve an army

  tontic sank back complacently after
the first week of the snow blockade
blessing the tin can but it sat bolt up-
right directly when it appeared that
there was a famine in something to
which the community had never before
given a thought

  and as this famine strangely enough
had to do with the folly of sowders
mention must be made at once of a most
important person-the most important
person-in tontic society mrs senator
b y l judson wife of the represen-
tative of the tontic and eldora dis-
tricts in the upper house of the state
legislature

  coincident with the beginning of the
storm mrs judson had announced a
function at the tontic grand hotel to
which all that was socially possible in
the town had been bidden

  it is not too extravagant to say that
in this function the camp faced its first
great social event it had been whis-
pered that mrs judson had contracted
fot the entire second floor of the cara-
vansary and as for expense senator
judson had himself consigned the ques-
tion to a place remote

  and it was further reported that

among the items to grace the banquet
were the rare and succulent provisions
of the oyster beds to be transported
directly from the sea-shore thousands
of miles away these provisions had
indeed providentially arrived with the
last loads of freight that came into
camp before traffic was interrupted and
had since been on ice awaiting the
eventful night

  therefore let the storm king rage
mrs judson was not to be denied

  and thus on the eve of the great
function when the five hundred elect of
tontic-and they were at this period
mostly masculine-quivered with antici-
pation of the morrow a short hoarse
cry rang out into the night it was a
cry for a white shirt witli a stiff bosom

  the cry went far and was echoed
tontic made  great exactions in the
matter of dress in general it worried
along in blue flannel and corduroy

  but here was more serious matter
respect for mrs senator judson re-
spect for a  parlor affair demanded
of all male comers at least a white shirt
and a string tie and it was the dis-
covery that white shirts were not on the
market that caused strong men to utter
the language that conies only with great
emotions

  in vain the levi brothers affected to
explain in vain they realized too late
that mr abram levi had made the
financial mistake of his life when he
sold for two dollars each shirts that
would now bring almost any amount

  and vainer still was the pleading of
the levis after they had gone down the
long street to sowders cabin and there
offered him double and thrice his money
for sowders sitting in the midst of
ruin cowering under remorse had at
once grasped the situation and sent his
callers forth with a stern and firm voice

  when therefore a committee of
earnest citizens representing nearly all
who had been favored with an invita-
tion to mrs judsons epoch-making
party waited upon sowders after levis
negotiations had failed they found a
calm supremely-poised individual
basking in the sunlight of self-oonfi-
dence

  he listened unmoved to entreaties
a speculation in shirts



the offers of five dollars a shirt were
scorned not until the gentle art of
sareasni came into play did he show a
trace of color

    yon wont lend em to us com-
plained an exasperated committeeman
 and you wont take a reasonable offer
for em so what wed like to know is
what you reckon youre goin to do
with em  

   it has occurred to me said sow-
ders suavely  that i might wear em
it has happened to occur to my dense in-
tellect that way

   so you might scorned the com-
mitteeman  ajthough i present this
argument to these here that its
strange a man wants three hundred
shirts when he aint changed the one
hes got on for what appears to be a
spell of about two months

  sowders looked pained but not sur-
prised ignoring the speaker he glanced
into the crowd that accompanied him
and in stately self-respect spoke these
words

   it is one of my precepts that any
man has got a right to say right out
anything he may have on his mind in a
general way so long as he dont break
though any side walls into the claim of
another mans feelins now my shirt
goes to the sluice every tuesday after-
noon whether ive one or fifty it dont
take no assay to see that the gentlemen
assembled here beneath my roof have
a matter of wearin apparel they desire
to air

   if this meetin has a spokesman
who is familiar with the fundamental
rules of etiquette to be observed when
one respectable citizen is addressin an-
other its his turn to get into the bucket
and give the signal to proceed to the
top

  thus sowders proud injured inno-
cent the man who had spoken fell
back and the crowd gathered to itself

  tact it was plain was needed here
as was meet the task fell to the justice
of the peace

   the esteemed fellow-citizen who
has just spoke said the justice in a
tone of conciliation  voiced his senti-
ments in a spirit of what we may call
shirt-less exasperation and his condi-
tion of mind is to be taken into account

   i need not remind the hon mr
sowders here that the situation which
confronts many of the people of this
camp is in many respects peculiar we
take a survey we find that we are each
and generally committed to a social
duty it would be ungallant for any gen-
tleman to shirk

   we find that there are ah-certain
necessities of the sartorial art insepa-
rable with carrying out this duty-acces-
sories i may say that are indispensable
in the presence of ladies and it fur-
ther appears that the principal acces-
sory is to wit a white boiled shirt so
far as i am concerned gentlemen-

  here the justice turned to the listen-
ing committee while his bosom swelled

   so far as i am concerned rather
than appear at mrs senator judsons
function without the proper embellish-
ment of a white boiled shirt rather
than insult that ladv by appearing with-
out it rather than flount in her face a
blue flannel turn-me-down or a calico
made-easy i would go forth into the
night of social oblivion

   we know what is demanded of usy
gentlemen we cannot plead ignorance
of social custom we either go in the
manner somewhere described as aw fay
or we dont go at all and if we dont
go at all we deliberately cut the feelings
of a lady

  there could be no dissent to this pre-
sentation of facts and conditions the
committee solemnly declared its truth

   bein so continued the justice
 we confront the hon mr sowders and
the question of his shirts we cannot
deny three tilings gentlemen they are
that mr sowders has the shirts that it
is desirable that we obtain them and
that it rests with mr sowders to point
the way to the-ah gratification of our
desires

   and we must not act in haste nor
with temper it is not to be denied
that mr sowders is honorably possessed
of these shirts the same as if they were
wheat or corn or any of the commo-
dities of the market that are likely to be
in demand they are his paid for with
his cash and for him to have and to
hold until he sees fit to part with em-
which brings us to the point of our mis-
sion


the argosy

mr

  u we are given to understand
sowders that you refused the messrs
levi their offer of six dollars each tor

these shirts  -	  

  sowders still standing beside the
table waved one hand to the justice m
appreciative cordiality at the same
time his face did not relax its severity

  	the understand you have lie
said  is unanimously correct

   then mav i ak resumed the jus-
tice  if you have fixed any particular
price on the precious articles that are
now in your possession  

  the committee made a movement
that- suggested the keenest interest

   keplvin to your perfectly respect-
ful question said sowders  i will say
that i have fixed a price and further
replviu i will say that  do not propose
to dispose of these shirts in no common
way ive been revolvin the situation in
my mind mr justice and gentlemen of
the committee

   i am not mercenary-in fact my
nature is calculated to respond to them
thats in distress or that has struck bot-
tom with nothin to show for it if you
were poor gentlemen and came to me
empty of pocket distressed demandin
of my white shirts i would give freely
but as i take it this is no ten-cent
community lookin for alms

  a murmur of assent told sowders
that he was not in a ten-cent com-
munity in tact the faces of several of
the citizens of tontic reflected resent-
ment

  we are quite able hete ventured
the justice of the peace  to pay any
price you may ask

   i will ask you to remember them
words said sowders  when i have
related to you the fable of the king of

egypt-

  the crowd stared curiously sowders
placed one hand on the table for sup-
port and gazed serenely toward his vis-
itors

   i am actin under historical pre-
cedent he said  as my fellow-
citizen the justice may recall from his
studies of the land of the pharaohs-
and i am not speaking of a lay-out
gentlemen-there was once a king who
ruled over a good acreage of land but
who had trouble find in producers

   his treasury was empty at about
the time the gods called on him to build
a temple and as he owed the affiliated
orders of egypt pyramid masons and
brick layers pretty heavy for some old
jobs things begun to look black

  just here the court philosopher
who usually had a vein he could tap
even if it was only in his head hove on
the scene as radiant as the dews of the
morn  what you want  mighty king
said this here philosopher  is a special
assessment tax

  it wont work says the king

 ive got only about five hundred thou-
sand people and if i make the ordinary
average equality tax there wont be
enough to build a side wall let alone a
whole temple

    weve been taxin the poor until
theyve got nothin left to take and as
for the rich theyve got their assessment
cases up before the supreme court now
on the basis that the last levy was too
high

    ive got about two thousand mil-
lionaires it is true but i dont seem to
be able to get at em goin to show
gentlemen that times hasnt changed so
all-fired much

   and now comes the court philoso-
pher with his scheme  what you want

	king says he  is to excite these
millionaires into a game of chance you
just announce a royal nile lottery of
which half the proceeds go to buildin
this temple an the other half to the
man who draws the lucky number and
you issue just two thousand tickets for
this same game of chance

  you dont want any ordinary lot-
tery the stakes must be high it oc-
curs to me  king that the loyal sub-
ject who draws number one should pay
therefore one piece of gold the second
pays two pieces the third three and so
on to the end when youve got your
capital prize-to be cut in half-
amountin to the sum total of two thou-
sand pieces of gold added down to one

   the moral of these remarks gentle-
man was that the king was struck
mightily the royal nile lottery went
into operation and the result was one
of the monuments to architecture the
ruins of which we see in egypt to-day
if we happen to travel those trails

i
a speculation in shirts



  w and now my fellow citizens ive
no wish to prolong or to adorn this
parable history is a great thing it
has come to my rescue in this crisis my
proposition is this

   in a proper receptacle will be placed
three hundred pieces of paper numbered
consecutively the fortunate individual
drawin number one gets his shirt for
the inconsiderable sum of one dollar
one half what i paid for the same the
second pays two dollars the third three
as was the way in egypt and each figure
thereafter represents a similar advance
in this way we may dispose of the prob-
lem that confronts us any other way
 regret to state an i keep the shirts
the auditors of sowders did not at
once break their silence when he had
concluded they were confused partly
by this plunge into history-or fable-
and partly by the mathematics pre-
sented

  understanding first dawned on the
individual who had offended sowders by
his reference to laundry shortcomings

  this means he said slowly ad-
dressing the happy owner of the shirt
mine  that one of us pays three hun-
dred dollars for the privilege of ap-
pearin at mrs senator judsons soiree
in one of these genteel furnish ins-am
i right  

   the idea assented sowders
 seems to have percolated

   an somebody else pays two hun-
dred and ninety-nine-

   an then the scale drops assented
the shirt man

  he who had grasped the situation
turned on the others

   dont you see he exclaimed  the
way he figures it out is better n if hed
busted up faro charlie dont you see
that hes smeltin free-millin ore  hetl
get a pile out oi these shirts its
geometry-i cant figure it out but its
geometry-an its like the frog what
jumps two feet up the well an falls back
three

  his companions stared some at-
tempted to count on their fingers
others made hopeless mental calcula-
tions sowders broke in on their be-
wilderment by another statement of
facts 

   it aint geometry he said calmly

 its plain addition an some division
it means just fortv-one thousand five
hundred dollars to me or it means
nothin  may remark in this connec-
tion that  aint sojournin here for the
benefits afforded by the climate or to
rebuild a racked and wasted constitu-
tion but-sadly-i had calculated
there was some sportin instincts in this
population

  the justice spoke again

   of course we can all send our re-
grets to mrs judson-

  he got no further there was a
babel of protest it welled up vigor-
ously from a large person who longed
for oysters and it was shrilled by a
thin citizen who reminded every one
within ear-shot that whatever he was he
was not cheap

  the objections were so general and
pointed that the justice recalled his re-
mark he had made the suggestion
purely at random he said in a thought-
less moment and in the interest of
economy but he would be the last he
averred to criticize the unique propo-
sition made by mr sowders which was
perfectly legal as well as worth atten-
tion from its historical inception

  and the truth was that the element
of speculation appealed directly to the
majority of sowders hearers theirs
was a life of chance chance sent them
into the rock-fast hills by day chance
brought them together in the halls of
tontic by night

  chance was a game now lost now
won the pursuit of chance made the
blood tingle

  chance was life and he who brought
chance in a new form was to be consid-
ered lie offered something to the sport
of luck

  sowders smiled faintly as the men
before him were swept by the wave of
chance that drowned the minor voices
of protest he knew his market and
those who would come to purchase

	  

  at the crystal palace an hour later
a pyramid of shirt boxes rose pictur-
esquely from the center of the room
guarded bv sowders on a near-by
table faro charlie sorted little bits of
paper and placed them in a jar and
when he had concluded his task a line


the argosy

of three hundred men formed in a circle
about the room and began a procession
past this given point of interest

  as each man reached the jar his hand
shot into the opening and his lingers
closed on a piece of paper a ridicu-
louslv simple transaction yet offering
moments of suspense that were hig  y
dramatic

  for as the number was high or low
the possessor was correspondingly de-
pressed or elated and his luck deplored
or approved by his interested friends

he was followed from the jar to the

pyramid where in exchange for the
cash equivalent of the number lie had
drawn sowders gave him a box con-
taining one white stiff-bosomed shirt

  there never was such a night it
reached its height when the disclosure
was made that to the justice of the
peace fell the pleasure of paying for the
tliree-hundred-dollar shirt which re-
mains to this day the highest price ever
paid for an article of this sort within
the borders of colorado

ttlrle  co limited

trenwycks forte was the ex-
traordinary and it seemed natural
for the unusual things of life to come
his way so it can scarcely be called
an accident that brought that peculiar

-	ad  to his attention the paragraph
lurked obscurely in the want column
of his morning paper blowing across his
path with all the outre freshness of a
discovery that might lead to startling
results

  wanted-a party of courageous men
experts in the various trades to accom-
pany a philanthropic gentleman on a
mission of enlightenment to the middle
ages single men only references ex-
changed an opportunity offers to con-
struct anew the history of several be-
nighted nations if interested call or

no  forty-third street

  trenwyck read it aloud to blinkers
blinkers it may be explained in passing
was a texas product whom through
earnest solicitation trenwyck had
undertaken to exploit through the
many abnormal phases of his own
career

  blinkers was always at high pressure

to suit his taste life had to be piquant
with the unexpected thrills were his
stock in trade andlie was never so much
at home as when tending shop

   if i could understand that said
blinkers referring to the  ad  i
dont know but it would make a hit with
me what does it mean tren

   i give it up trenwyck admitted

   suppose we take a whirl over on
forty-third street and look into the
thing  

  trenwyck agreed and in twenty
minutes a cab set them down in front
of tapscotts lodgings a maid opened
the door and ushered them up one flight
to the philanthropic gentlemans apart-
ments

  she was not a nice-looking maid her
hair was fuzzy with curl papers and her
apron should have been at the laun-
dry

  when she left the two callers she
shrugged her shoulders put her tongue
in her cheek and squinted her eyes

   what do you mean by that young
lady blinkers asked looking over
the banister as she slouched downward

   youre a couple o nice ones to be
callin on the likes of him-i dont
think she answered with refreshing
candor	
marooned in 



  whats the matter with him

  she drummed her knuckles against
her forehead

   dippy she gurgled and went on
down

   this grows interestin murmured
blinkers turning away from the ban-
isters as trenwyck knocked on tap-
scotts door

  the door was opened by the philan-
thropic gentleman himself re was
well advanced in years wore an old
dressing-gown and a pair of earpet-
slippers and was holding a test-tube in
his hand

  on a table off to one side streamed
the bluish flame of an alcohol lamp
over the table was a shelf containing
a glass retort two or three parting-
flasks and many bottles

  a dank unhealthy odor caused by a
combination of plant-life and a super-
heated atmosphere manifested itself in
the room there were three windows
and each was filled with potted plants-
strange plants such as trenwyck had
never seen before

  reporters asked tapscott look-
ing his visitors over

   no trenwyck answered

   certainly not police officers-in
disguise  he went on holding the tube
between his eye and the light and
searching its contents

   certainly not 

  tapscott heaved a long breath evi-
dently of relief placing the test-tube
in a rack on the table he capped the
spirit lamp waved his callers to chairs
and took a seat opposite

    would you believe it said he  you
are the first ones to call on me in a spirit
of legitimate inquiry are you pre-
pared to take hold of my project

  you mean to finance it tren-
wyck returned

  tie tossed his hands in petulant dep-
recation

   no money is needed what i want
is brains-nineteenth-century brains to
grapple with the barbarism of the dark
a-s

  blinkers rolled a cigarette and set-
tled down to a quiet enjoyment of the
interview trenwyck having secured
the keynote of tapscotts mania played
it to draw him out

   wouldnt that be a trille difficult 
he suggested  providing a man could
get back to the era you suggest its his-
tory is already made and could not be
warped one way or the other

  color rushed into tapscotfs sallow
cheeks his eyes lit up and his whole
form grew animated

   time he pursued dogmatically
 even when following his ordinary for-
ward course and registering his prosy
stages on a clock dial is the producer
of many riddles that vex the under-
standing yet when as i can make
manifest he reverses his course and
covers centuries at a backward bound
our respectable gregorian calendar
staggers with the weight of its mys-
teries

  blinkers was over his head so was
trenwyck for that matter although he
was thoroughly determined to persist
until he had come closer to tapscott s
hobby

   we are dealing in general terms
trenwyck observed  suppose we
come at onc-e to the crux of the matter
mr tapscott just what- sort of a
proposition have you to make

   we cannot get away from these
general terms until we are done with the
very bone and marrow of the proposi-
tion he answered  time gentlemen
is inerely a personal matter it is as
much a mans property as the clothes
on his back or the dollar in his pocket
time is the inheritance of life which in
itself is but a manifestation of time
time begins at birth ceases at death
and for him that was time is and can be
 more

   sir i am on intimate terms with
time the old gentleman has grown
fond of me and from a simple desire to
please he will take me by the hand turn
squarely about and retreat along his
ancient path

    might state that we have formed
a partnership known as time  com-
pany limited in this scheme for the
regeneration of the middle ages we
work together with an eye single to the
main purpose

   what  desire cried tapscott
warming to his theme  is to plant a
colony of skilled artisans somewhere in
the feudal period-in short giving our
the argosy

benighted brothers the glorious civiliza-
tion of our own progressive times i
would present them with the telegraph
the telephone the electric light the
printing press the steamboat anil the
thousand and one other nineteenth-
century wonders

  the essence of the plan was begin-
ning to dawn upon trenwyck truly
it was a colossal idea and most at-
tractive

  it is your intention then saul
trenwvck  to assemble a number of
master workmen representatives of
various trades and take them and their
paraphernalia backward through the
ages  

   xot their paraphernalia mr tren-
wyck it is possible to take with us
only such material as we can carry in
our hands once we arrive on the scene
of our labors we will fall to on the raw
product and build out of that the
various vehicles of latter-day progress
do you follow me  

  blinkers sat as though stunned the
cigarette had burned itself out between
his fingers and his wide eyes were
fastened blankly on the face of tap-
seott

  trenwyck was only a degree less im-
pressed during the silence that fol-
lowed tapsc-otts query as to whether
they grasped the amazing terms of his
proposition a rough hand was laid on
the hall door and threw it open two
police officers entered

  tapscott was on his feet in a flash

   what is the meaning of this intru-
sion he demanded

  your name is tapscott inquired
one of the officers

   yes

   then youll have to go with us
dont get excited now the officer
added in his most soothing tones
 were not going to do anything to
hurt you

     have done nothing to warrant my
arrest faltered tapscott looking help-
lessly toward trenwyck and blinkers
i am a law-abiding citizen officer

   of course you are acquiesced the
officer cheerfully

  then what is this all about

   well a complaint has been entered
against you

   what kind of a complaint 

   youll have to appear in court mr
tapscott and convince the judges that
you are mentally competent and that
vou will not endanger the peace of the
community if left at large

  a look of horror overspread tap-
scotts face suddenly a choking cry
escaped him and he whirled and dashed
for a rear room

  one of the policemen caught the
living skirts of his dressing-gown and
brought him to so abrupt a halt that lie
fell to his knees

   wed better pull out tren said
blinkers starting up

  trenwyck likewise arose before
they gained the hall tapscott called to
them

  wait gentlemen just a few mo-
ments i beg of you 

  humor him one of the officers
whispered in trenwycks ear  the
old chap means well enough but hes
dotty-theres no kind of doubt about
that

  is byngs back of this inquired
tapscott of his captors  t orcival
byngs 

   professor byngs made the com-
plaint was the answer

 ah a glint came into tap-
seotts eyes as he got up from his knees
 i thought as much

  trenwyck and blinkers returned to
their chairs trenwyck had an ill-
defined feeling that something remark-
able was going to happen and awaited
developments with profound curiosity

chapter ii

  tapscott takes french leave

   gentlemen observed tapscott
 this is a plot against me engineered by
my rival byngs emeritus professor of
polynesian flora in the university of
hoboken lie resents my success in
acquiring a unique plant from borneo
and his small mind suggests retaliation
in this despicable manner

  he turned to his captors

    i will make you no trouble but if
you will allow me i should like to write
a letter

   go ahead mr tapscott was the
marooned in 

answer  we dont want to be hard on
you

   watched vigilantly by tlie bluecoats
tapscott pulled a chair to the table and
brushed aside the scientific clap-trap to
make place for his epistolary labors

   from the shelf above be took a bottle
of ink and a pen and from the table
drawer a pad of paper

  his slightest movement claimed the
closest attention of four pairs of eyes
the officers were on the alert to fore-
stall a deed of violence while blinkers
and trenwyck were under thrall of a
suspense that grew sharper by swift
degrees

  tapscott now calm and unruffled
pulled a sheet from the pad folded it
carefully and divided it in half then
he reached for the test tube and emptied
its contents - a heap of brownish
grains-upon one of the scraps of
paper

  with muttered exclamations the of-
ficers darted forward tapscott smiled
at them

   u do not be unduly exercised gentle-
men said he  this is merely the
fruit of one of my crazy experiments
and hence not of sufficient importance
to cause alarm

  the officers drew back abashed and
tapscott proceeded with his work
with the pen point he counted out a
number of the grains and slipped them
to the other scrap of paper after which
he folded both papers into neat little
packets

   now for the letter said he and
set himself to writing

  a few minutes completed the task
addressing an envelope he placed the
folded letter inside together with one or
both of the packets

  trenwyck was under the impression
at the time that both packets went into
the envelope and was sure the officers
were of like opinion tapscott manipu-
lated the matter so deftly that what
happened was all the more surprising

    there said he handing the sealed
envelope to trenwyck  will you have
the kindness to deliver that for me mr
t renwyck  

  the letter bore the memorandum
 for you to be opened some time after
you leave here



  trenwyck gave him a nod and put the
letter in his pocket

   thank you

  tapscott removed another packet
wrapped in green paper from the table
drawer and got up

   of course be said to the officers
 i cannot go out on the street in a
dressing-gown and slippers will you
allow me to go into my bedroom and
make ready to accompany you  

   you go with him pringle said one
of the policemen to his companion

  trenwyck thought a shade of annoy-
ance crossed tapscotts face but it was
only momentary his vision cleared
and he started for the door of the rear
room followed by pringle

  hand on the knob he paused and
looked back at trenwyck it was a
long look and a strange one pregnant
with deep meaning

  trenwyck was mystified only in the
light of later events did the significance
of that last look become clear

  heres a layout muttered
blinkers drawing a long breath
 talk about your mysteries tren-
this is the clear quill and no mistake
 not much of a mystery here struck
in the officer  the old gent is off his
trolley and lias been for a year or more
did you see that ad  he put in the
paper this morning

  t thats what brought us here said
trenwyck  curiosity you know he
hastened to add

   byngs is the best friend tapscott
ever had if he did but know it con-
tinued the officer  but tapscott thinks
byngs is jealous of him when one of
these scientific codgers gets an idea like

that in his head lies-

   a wild rell burst from the other room
trenwyck blinkers and the officer
sprang up in consternation and rushed
at the door the officer leading

  pringle liis face ashen and distorted
with fear and wonder was leaning
against the wall tightly clutched in
bis hands was tapscotts dressing-gown
tapscott himself was not in evidence

   where is he  cried the officer who
had led the rush into the bedroom
 wake up man  he added grabbing
pringle by the shoulders and shaking
him roughly wheres tapscott
the argosy

  pringle lifted a hand to his head
with the other hand he raised the old
dressing-gown and shook it feebly ap-
parently with some notion that tapscott
might drop out of it

  good heavens gasped pringle
then cast the dressing-gown from him
and sank limply on the bed his eyes
roving about the narrow chamber

  the other bluecoat had impatiently
rummasred through a closet looked be-
hind a dresser peered under the bed
and was now examining the fastenings
of the window

   speak cant you   he demanded
turning to pringle

  did-did he get out through the
other room   inquired pringle in halt-
ing tones

   of course he didnt

  li then vou search me hickman it
beats the devil just after  closed the
door tapscott went to the washbowl and
drew a glass of water quick as a wink
he emptied something into the glass and
took it down at a gulp just as i jumped
at him

   then what happened   queried
hickman

   thats too many for me replied
pringle shaking his head  all i know
is that  stood there holding the dress-
ing-gown tapscott was gone

   he dodged out somehow declared
hickman it aint possible for a man
to make a get-away like that without
having things fixed you look around
here while i go and search the rest of
the house

  during the excitement that followed
trenwyck and blinkers slipped away
in the hall outside they encountered the
skulking figure of a man standing close
to the door

  he might have been a lodger at-
tracted by the disturbance in tapscotts
rooms be that as it may he was a low-
browed questions ble-loo king fellow
and trenwyck and blinkers eyed him
suspiciously as they passed

  the cab that had brought them stood
in front on waiting orders and during
the ride back to their hotel the two
friends smoked and wrestled with the
bituation

  at last trenwycks thoughts drifted
to the letter on opening it he found

that only one of the packets was en-
closed-the larger of the two

   what does the letter have to say 
asked blinkers and forthwith trenwyck

read it to him

dear sib 

  as you have seen circumstances over
which i have no control make necessary
my abrupt departure for the past i
have long known this storm was brewing-
but hoped i could make port in the
middle apes with my colony of artisans
before it burst upon me now i alone
must be the evangel of civilization and
progress to those benighted peoples

  although  enclose you the means i do
not ask you to follow me it is a step no
man would dare consider unless impelled
by convictions as strong as my own

  the packet given you herewith con-
tains a supply of seeds of the wonderful
plant developed by me after years of
painstaking culture this hybrid i have
dubbed the lempus fugitarius it is a
cross between the indian poppy and a
rare plant of unknown species found in
borneo

  to become effective as a means for
bridging the present and the past the
seeds must be treated chemically-which
while rounding out their tremendous
powers at the same time renders them
instantly soluble in water i had just
finished treating the seeds enclosed when
you called on me this morning besides
these and those i have with me there
are no more in existence and the mother-
plant has been destroyed

  every one of these time seeds will set a
man back half a century i shall make
my journey by easy stages covering fifty
years at first and proceeding to the scene
of my labors in darkest europe then
on and on as fancy takes me my one
regret is that untoward events make
necessary an ill-timed departure

  should you have recourse to the seeds
in your quest after ancient times fail
not to take them on the very spot where
you would cast your fortunes and re-
member you can take nothing with you
apart from what can be carried in the
hands or stored about the person

  across the years i give you greeting
half a century separates us and yet the
ink is scarcely dry on this letter which i
have written

percival tapscott

  what do you think blinkers
trenwyck asked replacing the letter
and the packet of seeds in his pocket
marooned in 



   cleopatra and the nile said
blinkers musingly  hank billings of
san antone lent me a book once that
told a lot of yarns about cleopatra do
you think there are enough seeds to take
us that far 

   it would be a waste of good ma-
terial even if there were answered
trenwyck sharply  well try tap-
scotts prescription however

  dark ages blinkers asked lugu-
briously

   not so far spain-bonaparte-
peninsular campaign ill write a
sequel to the  mistakes from the view-
point of an eye-witness

  blinkers brightened perceptibly but
trenwyck could see that his fancy was
still hovering around the pyramids

  youre the doctor tren said
blinkers clasping his friends hand
just pick out your century and well
emigrate no one ever did anything
like this before do you think

  no one but tapscott

   its a comforting thought blinkers
observed as they descended from the
cab in front of their hotel

  had trenwyck considered wisely he
would have left blinkers behind when
taking that headlong plunge into the
past blinkers had a weird propensity
for giving rein to his own sweet will
utterly reckless of consequences-a
characteristic as dangerous for his
friends as deplorable for himself

  with trenwyck however blinkers
was a habit acquired to an extent which
rendered the expedition impossible
without him

  so they were to  emigrate  in com-
pany

chapter iii

a frustrated robbery

  jason trenwyck came of a good old
family noted for its self-sufficiency in
fact that honest one-legged despot who
was the last dutch governor of new
york was numbered among his for-
bears

  this scion of the trenwycks was born
into poverty and its attendant priva-
tions early in youth he availed him-
self of horace greeleys advice and
trekked for the setting sun

   years later when he returned to his
 native city he brought with him a vast
 fund of experience much wealth that
 hatred of the commonplace which
 formed his most distinguishing trait-
 and blinkers

  trenwyck had taken his turn at
 ranching mining politics and a dozen
 other pursuits the west had to offer as
 his mind expanded he developed a taste
 for literature which coming arm in arm
 with a saving sense of humor fell just
 short of a dangerous stage

   it may be remembered that he found
 a  cypher  in the so-called shake-
 speare plays which laid their authorship
 as unquestionably at the door of the
 lamented bill nye as others have laid it
 at the -door of francis bacon

   he also wrote a volume on  the mis-
 takes of napoleon with especial refer-
 ence to the peninsular campaign
 the ms of this work was returned by
 one publisher with a personal letter to
 the effect that  they were sorry to re-
 turn his paper but he had written on
 it trenwyck immediately published
 the book himself

   late in the evening of the day that
 witnessed their adventure in forty-
 third street trenwyck and blinkers
 were in the sitting-room of their suite
 discussing ways and means trenwyck
 was lounging in an easy-chair by a table
 a cigar between his lips a mug of his
 favorite shandygaff at his elbow and the
 seeds of the tempus fugitarius heaped
 up on a piece of paper on the table-top

   there were ninety-three of the seeds
 as they had found by actual count each
 about the size of a grain of millet the
 entire supply could easily have been
 placed on the blade of a pocket-knife

   just how many years tren said
  blinkers blowing thoughtful whiffs
 from his cigarette  are locked up in
 that thimbleful of seeds

   four thousand six hundred and
 fifty answered trenwyck

  great christopher what a heap
 of traveling we could do if we used all
 those seeds for transportation-provid-
 ing of course tapscott hasnt rung in a
 bluff on us

    you havent any doubts about tap-
 scott have you it seems to me he has
 proved his case


the argosy

   the idea sort of staggers me re-
turned blinkers  id like a little more

proof	

   well test the seeds ourselves anti
that will be the very best kind of proof
 then were off for spain 

   by first boat i have already en-
gaged passage to liverpool

  a summons fell on the door at that
moment blinkers answered it and a
thin little man in rusty black topped
with a high hat that might have been
the vogue in the s stepped across the
threshold

   pardon me for coming right up
gentlemen said the caller removing
his hat  my business is very impor-
tant so yon will excusc the lateness of
the hour

  his hair was white and he wore large
glasses through which he looked penc-
tratingly from trenwyck to blinkers
and back again to trenwyck

   my name is byngs he proceeded
 and l hold the chair of polynesian
florauniversity of hoboken i under-
stand that you -he was now addressing
trenwyck- were handed a letter this
morning by mr tapscott may i in-
quire sir if that letter was for me 
trenwycks face hardened here was
the rival scientist whose attempt to halo
tapscott before the insanity court had
sent that gentleman into the past before
he was ready to go

   the letter was not for you profes-
sor byngs said trenwyck coldly

   no the little man evinced con-
siderable disappointment  was it for
the institution with which i have the
honor to be affiliated

   it was for myself replied tren-
wyck

  the professors eyes fell on the table
and a cry escaped from his lips

   there they are-the seeds of the
hybrid 

  he flung himself forward but
blinkers grabbed him about the
middle and deposited him in a chair

   take it easy professor said
blinkers  those are the seeds all
ri t but we can t allow you to tamper
with them

  byngs writhed in the chair until he
was able to fish a red handkerchief from
the tail of his coat

  you gentlemen do not understand
this matter said he mopping his
brow

    believe we understand it quite
thoroughly answered trenwyck fold-
ing up the seeds and depositing them in
a drawer of the table  your designs
upon mr tapscotts liberty have led to
deplorable results professor bvngs

   i still insist that you are not ac-
quainted with the ulterior aspects of the
proposition persisted byngs  the
department of which i am the honorary
head was left a bequest of several thou-
sand dollars for research among the
flora of borneo and taliati

   a yacht was chartered and i went
 polynesia where i secured a single
specimen of a unique plant quite un-
known to the botany of the pacific
islands or any other part of the world
that plant gentlemen had an affinity
for the passing hours telling each one
of the twenty-four accurately through
color changes in the petals of the blos-
som

   had i been allowed to make further
study of this rare specimen-which i
called the tempus byngiensis-i am sure
that the name of byngs would have
leaped into fame among scientists every-
where but this renown was basely
filched away from me

  stolen exclaimed trenwyck

   aye stolen tapscott heard of
the plant and bribed the skipper of the
yacht to smuggle it ashore and give it
into his hands the theft was safely
consummated and the fruits of my labor
were lost to me

   tapscott as is very well known is
not mentally responsible i am told he
has destroyed the specimen of the
tempus byngiensis but that some seeds
still remain likewise i was told that
he had written a letter and enclosed
therein a packet of the seeds entrusting
same to your care

   i had hoped that repentance had
urged him to rectify the great wrong he
had done me and that the letter and the
packet were for myself inasmuch as
this is not the case i consider that  am
well within my rights when  demand
that you turn the seeds over to me

   that is your storv professor
byngs said trenwyckbut you cannot
marooned in 

suppose that i would give up the seeds
until i had heard tapscotts side of it-
which is now impossible

    where is tapscott  

     cannot tell you for to do so would
betray his confidence

  the professors eyes gleamed angrily
as he got out of the chair

   will you give me part of the packet
then   asked he

   no

  byngs walked to the door his slight
form shaking with the wrath that con-
vulsed him

   we shall see we shall see he mut-
tered  shere are ways to compel an
adjustment of the wrong  have suffered
and  shall lose no time in setting about
it

  with that the little man flung out of
the room and slammed the door

  whew exclaimed blinkers as
he shoved the bolt behind him
 these scientists are warm fellows
when they think they have a grievance

   byngs made tapscott a lot of
trouble said trenwyck  and possibly
he will annoy us with his schemes unless
we take time by the forelock and get out
of the country fortunately we sail in
the morning

  trenwyck got up laid aside the re-
mains of his cigar finished the last of
his shandygaff and went off to bed
blinkers soon followed him

  two bedrooms opened off the larger
room one at each end in his own
chamber blinkers wrestled with his
thoughts for a long time at the expense
of his rest

  when he finally lost himself it was in
an uneasy slumber from which he was
abruptly awakened some one it
seemed to him was moving stealthily
about the sitting-room

  getting softly out of bed he stole
to the chamber door and peered
through

  a gas-jet was burning dimly above the
table in its light he saw that the tablc-
drawer was open that the paper con-
taining the seeds had been removed
and unfolded and that a questionable-
looking man stood close by and was
gazing down at them

  the intruder wore a cap and a mask
a dark lantern with the shutter closed

      	a



stood on the table near a decanter of
wine and a revolver lay near the seeds

  trenwycks suite of rooms was in the
third story at the back of the hotel
a fire-escape ran past the window of
the larger room and blinkers observed
that this window was open

  a robbery was being consummated
as blinkers watched the thief pushed
back his cap and shifted the mask to
brush one sleeve across his forehead

  lie was the very man who had been
in the hall outside tapscoits lodgings
when blinkers and trenwyck had taken
their departure for the forty-third
street house

  after replacing his cap and mask the
robber poured himself a drink out of
the decanter and tossed it off at a swal-
low then he took a hasty look around
picked up his lantern and revolver and
started softly into trenwycks chamber

  blinkers had plenty of courage and
part of the equipment he had brought
from texas included a brace of six-
shooters with cat-like softness he
moved to his trunk look out one of the
revolvers and then stole from the cham-
ber

  the robber was still moving around
in trenwycks room at the table an
idea came to blinkers-rather a vague
expedient but he thought it well worth
the trying

  lifting one of the millet-like grains
on the point of a steel paper-knife he
dropped it into the glass by the de-
canter his next move was to hide
behind the curtains at the open window

  lie had not long to wait the robber
presently emerged from trenwycks
room and returned to the table there
he put down the lantern again thrust
his revolver into his hip-pocket and be-
gan folding up the packet of seeds what
blinkers had hoped for came to pass

  the intruders thirst once more mani-
fested itself and he poured a drink from
the decanter into the glass lie
quaffed it and then-the tumbler
crashed to fragments on the table

  aroused by the sound trenwyck
leaped from his bed and rushed into
the sitting-room blinkers a strange
expression on his face stood by the
talile and gave his friend a dazed look as
he ran toward him
the argosy

whats the matter blinkers

asked trenwyck

 r-r-robbery stuttered blinker

trenwyck turned up the light the
dark-lantern engaged his attention ana

then the packet	

 where is the thief cried tren-

  lie-he got away answered blink-
ers with a shiver  he was after those
eeds i reckon tren but i interrupted
his work before he could make off with
them

did he make oft with anything

else	 

  i dont know youd better look
through your clothes and find out

  trenwyck found that his pocketbook
was missing the night clerk was sum-
moned and the house policeman was put
on the trail

   the loss of a few dollars was nothing
to trenwyck who was more than thank-
ful that the packet had been saved
when he again sought his bed after the
excitement he had the packet under liis
pillow

  blinkers awed at his own temerity
and bewildered by the result of it
thought best to keep his own counsel

   if trenwyck ever counts up and
finds that one seed is missing thought
blinkers hell think the thief got away
with it well he did-but by chris-
topher it was sudden i i reckon tap-
scott wasnt so crazy as byngs is trying
to make out

chatter iv

sad business at burgos

  trenwyck and blinkers came into
spain by easy stages lingering in the
various capitals for a last taste of that
 glorious civilization  which tapscott
was seeking to carry to the middle
ages

  the delights of london and paris
almost wooed blinkers from their set-
tled purpose but trenwycks per-
suasions fortified by an important tele-
gram that reachcd him in the french
metropolis were sufficient and tren-
wyck brought blinkers away to bayonne
and thence into the basque provinces

  the telegram was from an old friend
major wickers who represented his

country at one of the spanish ports
meet me fonda del norte burgos
wednesday imperative so ran the

message

  the major was a bachelor upward of
fifty and in his native xuabama was
known as a successful iron founder
what imperative business he could have
with trenwyck was more than the latter
could imagine

  this was not the only thing that both-
ered trenwyck during the voyage
across to liverpool he had counted the
time seeds and had found that there
were but sixty-eight leaving twenty-five
unaccounted for

  what had become of the missing
twenty-five he questioned blinkers
and blinkers had evinced surprise but
nothing akin to guilt

  he suggested that as he seeds were
small they might have sifted out of the
packet trenwyck did not think this
possible but immediately he took steps
to keep the rest of the seeds secure be-
yond all possibility of loss

  professor byngs was on the boat with
them during the first day or two of
the voyage he had importuned tren-
wyck to divide the packet with him as-
serting that he had taken passage for
the sole purpose of securing some of the
seeds and that he would persist at all
hazards until he gained his end

  after two days of ineffective threats
and entreatiesbyngs apparently yielded
to the inevitable and frequented the
card-room where blinkers was passing
most of liis time in liverpool the
professor succeeded in effacing himself

  the contrast between byngs behavior
at the beginning of the trip and at the
end of it was so remarkable that tren-
wyck might have suspected that he had
accomplished his purpose had not the
difficulties in the way of it been so great
as it was he merely wondered and re-
frained from pressing any inquiries

  at irun just over the spanish boun-
dary the customs officials fell on blink-
ers luggage and confiscated two dozen
decks of playing-cards a box of chips a
roulette wheel and a faro layout

  they would have gone further and
confiscated blinkers hi in self no doubt
if trenwyck had not made judicious use
of a few pesetas
marooned in 



   what in the world were you going to
do with all that plunder trenwyck
demanded

   just in case we ran out of funds
tren blinkers explained  if were
to carry our civilization into the na-
poleonic era it struck me id look after
that end of it

   this comes of that gambling you
did on the way over said trenwyck
severely  and it isnt the sort of mis-
sionary work were going to engage iu
our business in making a jump back to
the beginning of the century blinkers
is to look up a few points of history and
to benefit the people as much as we
can in our feeble way-not to coax
louis dor from the french camp through
the medium of games of chance

  they reached burgos at ten in the
evening and were hauled to the majors
fonda by a row of three mules attached
to a rickety bus the whole force of
the establishment came out to receive
them and they had a chance to try the
greaser spanish they had picked up in
arizona

  it proved adequate and they were
conducted to a dingy salon with two bed-
rooms adjoining the omnibus mules
were stabled directly under them-but
they were in spain and not disposed to
be fastidious

  they had a late dinner sent up to
their rooms while they were discuss-
ing the soup the major stormed id

   knew youd come by gad he
shouted shaking trenwycks hands ef-
fusively and blinkers too well
well youre good to me boys by gad 
this comes of having friends when you
need em 

  the major was short but ponderous
the red of his pudgy face was relieved
by the white of his large mustaches

  his face was a little redder his mus-
tache a little whiter and his hair a little
thinner than when trenwyck had seen
him last

  but otherwise he was the same tem-
pestuous old major

   how did you know i was in paris
major trenwyck asked while his
friend floundered into a seat and
-quirrned to get at his cigar-case

   met dave gillum at barcelona-big
dave right from the states hes

thinking of taking a bunch of basques
or moors-i dont remember just which
-to the chicago fair dave said he
had met up with you and blinkers in
london and that you were to stop in
paris and then come on this way sorry
if i hurried you tren but i need you
to-morrow afternoon

   what for  

  the old fire-eater leaned back in his
chair and lighted his cigar

   duel he answered tersely

  trenwyck dropped knife and fork and
straightened up with a gasp blinkers
also showed a profound interest

   you dont mean to say that youre
going to fight a duel  exclaimed tren-
wyck

  who else the major returned
complacently  dont be in such a
taking tren its not the lirst time
by gad no dutchman can jump on the
stars and stripes and make faces at
the monroe doctrine while wickers is
around 

   is that what happened   trenwyck
inquired

   is it  the major wheezed  is it
the barcelona papers are full of it
this baron von lauderbach aired his
views at a little dinner given to the
foreign representatives what he said
-but i wont repeat what he said bv
gad it was enough i threw wine in
his face and would have followed the
wine with the tumbler if they hadnt
stopped me

   we exchanged cards if dave
hadnt been in a rush to get to madrid
id have had him for a second but
when he told me about you why i shot
that telegram into paris

   preliminaries are all arranged i
named place and weapons and selected
burgos and six-shooters-burgos be-
cause its on your route and i didnt
want to put you to any more inconven-
ience than  had to

  good heavens    trenwyck mut-
tered  are you mad major if you
go ahead with this piece of folly youre
liable to involve three governments

   i dont care a hang if i involve a
dozen wickers bristled no for-
eigner is going to shake his fist at the
american eagle in my presence without
hearing from me
the argosy

   where is the duel to take place
 lu a quiet little courtyard just long
enough for twenty paces dont try to
stop me tren fm all worked up about
this business and  have it out with
that baron if its the last thing  ever

do	

  he was as fixed as gibraltar and
when he went away about midnight
trenwyck was in no enviable frame of
mind

  baron von lauderbach the other
principal the major had told them was
an attache of the german embassy at
madrid

   the olcl boy is on the warpath
tren chuckled blinkers dropping the
stump of his cigarette into one of the
empty dishes and getting up with a
yawn

  -	weve got to stop this duel in some
way said trenwyck

    can stop it said blinkers
  how

   leave that to me tren

   no foolishness blinkers  tren-
wyck warned him

   sure not  returned the irresponsi-
ble blinkers  do you want me to go
ahead and try my hand  

  well you might trenwyck an-
swered yielding weakly to the gravity
of the situation  if you really think
you can accomplish anything

  blinkers went blithely to bed and in a
few minutes trenwick followed his ex-
ample trenwyck heard the call of the
night-watch two or three times before
dozing off to sleep and when he did
sleep he dreamed of duels and interna-
tional complications and other things
that had burdened his waking hours

  it was late when he woke up and-gave
his attention to the bread and chocolate
a waiter brought to the door blinkers
had dressed and gone out presumably
to execute his plan for putting a quietus
on the duel

  trenwyck hadnt much faith in
blinkers ability to have the affair called
off he had no acquaintance with the
baron but if that gentleman had come
all the way to burgos to fight it was
hardly possible he could be made to
apologize

  for trenwyck to go to the alcalde
with the matter would be to affront the

major most direfully yet that j- pre-
cisely what trenwyck was determined
to do before he should allow the foolish
affray to take place

  by the time trenwyck was dressed
wickers dropped in to consult with him
upon personal affairs as a provision
against fatalities blinkers returned
during the course of their conversation
and vouchsafed trenwyck a reassuring
wink

  had he really accomplished any-
thing if so what-and how tren-
wyck turned this phase of the matter
over in his mind as the three of them
went up-stairs and had their ahnuerzo
together

  trenwyck found no opportunity for
a quiet word with blinkers and hoped
wickers would leave them for a short
time after the meal but he did not
he had some tinkering to do with his
revolvers and followed them back to
their rooms to do it

  blinkers continued complacent and
reassuring the major smoked and
chaffed as he worked just to show how
cool he was and trenwyck fidgeted and
fretted

  while they were thus occupied their
host came to announce a caller and the
caller proved so impatient that he ran
excitedly into the room at the hosts
heels

  the major looked up and a stern ex-
pression overspread his red face

   zimmerman the barons second
said lie shooting a glance in trenwycks
direction and nodding toward the caller
after the landlord had retreated zim-
merman was tremendously wrought up
about something

  without any preliminaries whatever
he leaped into a torrent of german
striving to keep his frenzied gestures
abreast of the oral flood

  so far as trenwyck was concerned
the german language was an unknown
quantity blinkers apparently under
the spell of a pleasant excitement was
manufacturing a cigarette and smiling
to himself

  wickers whether he drew any sense
from the harangue or not preserved a
studied indifference

  presently trenwyck stepped forward
and interrupted herr zimmerman he
marooned in 



assured him in english that what ho
was saving was greek o them  also that
he was major wickers second and that
whatever he-zimmerman-had to say
must he put in terms they could under-
stand

  the perturbed teuton poured a glass
of water from a pitcher on the table and
while drinking it seemed to get better
control of himself when he spoke
again he was a little more lucid his
friend baron von lauderbach it ap-
peared had mysteriously vanished lie
had risen early that morning and had
begun writing letters

  on a desk in his chamber was a letter
half-written-broken abruptly off in the
midst of a sentence his hat and cane
were in the chamber and there was every
evidence that he had not intended
taking his departure

  yet he had departed and a search of
several hours had failed to reveal his
whereabouts

  the major gave a sarcastic laugh it
was a laugh that turned zimmerman
pale with vexation and chagrin for it
reflected upon the courage of his prin-
cipal

  so exclaimed the major not
daring to stand before me and give me
satisfaction this valiant baron takes to
the woods ill make this known
throughout the length and breadth of
spain by gad and if the poltroon
ever shows his face in my vicinity ill-
ill pull his nose for him 

   vat you speak iss nod true  cried
zimmerman  der baron has nod
taken by dcr voods no he has nod run
avay he vould haf a scorn for such as
d ot  immelblitzen  

  produce him produce him re-
turned the major if you dont pro-
duce this friend of yours zimmerman
the public will draw its own conclu-
sions

   how can i produce him ven i dond
know vere he iss gone said zimmer-
man helplessly  some accident has
happened mit him jali it must be you
vill be patient ilerr major und gif us a
leetle more time hey 

   not another hour said trenwyck

  zimmerman shrugged his shoulders
and walked to the door pausing there
he turned to add

   if der baron iss nod foundt it vill
afford me g-r-reat pleasure to take hin
place said he  i vould nod haf der
herr major disappointed

 never  declared trenwyck  my
friend lights with the baron or no one
zimmerman bowed humbly and left
he seemed a nice soldierly fellow and
trenwyck was sorry for him

 the moment zimmerman was gone
the attention of trenwyck and the
major was drawn to blinkers who was
choking with mirth in his chair

   look here blinkers said tren-
wyck  do you know what has happened
to the baron  

   my but this is rich  gasped blink-
ers of course i know whats hap-
pened to the baron tren if zimmer-
man finds him hell have to go back
some four hundred years 

  gad muttered wickers rising to
his feet and peering at trenwyck across
the table  is the fellow mad  

   what crazy thing have you done 
hissed trenwyck in blinkers ear bend-
ing over him and gripping his arm con-
vulsively

   i gave him eight of em admitted
blinkers  we had a glass together in

his room and i smuggled the-

  a slow horror ran through tren-
wycks veins

  blinkers reading the trepidation of
his soul in the lines of his face subsided
weakly

   i may have been a little hasty

tren blinkers quavered  but-

 hasty echoed trenwyck in a
hollow voice and turned away

chapter y

ttte cap sheaf

  a deep silence fell over the three in
the room the only sound that was
heard was caused by the restless tramp-
ing of the mules in the stable below

  tren pursued blinkers desper-
ately  there wasnt anything else for it
on mv word that baron was as cold-
blooded as a channel catfish hed have
made a vacancy in the diplomatic serv-
ice just as sure as youre a foot high 

  where did you get the seeds
asked trenwyck


the argosy

  blinkers grew suddenly mute

  events were trending toward a reve-
lation that dismayed him

   come out with it went on tren-
wyck with cutting firmness  where
did you get the seeds  

  on the boat when we came over
fi h then vou have abused my con-
fidence have you why didnt you tell
me you had rifled the packet when i
spoke to you about the loss i had dis-
covered  

   well temporized blinkers i did
not care to have you know those sharp-
ers were getting the best of me at one-
call-two

   what has your gambling on the
boat got to do with the missing seeds 
 pretty nearly everything oh hang
it tren im not going to keep this on
my mind any longer i took those
twenty-four seeds out of the packet
while you were sound asleep in your
bunk

   twenty-four came caustically
from trenwyck  there are twenty-
five gone wheres the other  

  i	got rid of that burglar in new
york with the other

   thats where the burglar went is
it  

yes i gave him fifty years byngs
got four hundred same as the baron
im beginning to understand what
sort of a deal did you make with

byngs

   i gave em to him reasonable tren
-fifty dollars per seed he got eight at
that figure and i sailed in with the pro-
ceeds and tried to win back what id
lost but the tinhorns had the cards
marked

   did you tell bvngs anything about
the mysterious properties of the

seeds 

    i did and he said i was crazy i told
him  wasnt as big a fool as  looked
and he said i couldnt be

  byngs had it about right blinkers
 ou wasted one on the thief eight on
byngs and eight on the baron that
leaves you with eight and i guess vou
better turn them over to me i am very
much put out with you blinkers

  the major had listened to this con-
versation with falling jaw and distended
eyes

   have you fellows gone daft entire-
ly he spoke up you talk like a
couple of madmen

  he turned to blinkers

   blinkers he went on sternly  if
you have been meddling in my affair of
honor it is high time i knew something
about it by gad 

   he did his meddling by my request
major said trenwyck

  wickers stared at trenwyck

   let me understand this matter
said the major with painful delibera-
tion  you sent blinkers to the baron
to see if our differences could not be
patched up without a resort to arms
 you do not appreciate the gravity

of the situation major or-

   i appreciate sir thundered the
major  that the wickers honor is at
stake i appreciate sir that this titled
nincompoop this baron nobody has
slurred that glorious banner that waves
above my home and my iron works and
that i am to be denied retaliation
and finally mr trenwyck i appreciate
that one whom i supposed to be my best
friend has had the audacity to restrain
me from the defense of my honor i
have the pleasure sir of wishing you a
very good morning 

  more in sorrow than in anger the
major gathered up his revolvers and
stalked toward the exit he found
trenwyck barring his way

  go back and sit down ordered
trenwyck 

   when the bands of friendship be-
gan the major morosely  have been
weakened to breaking by the misguided
officiousness of-er-er-of an inju-
dicious gentleman who-

   the injudicious gentleman means
what he says major wickers inter-
rupted trenwyck sternly go back
and take your chair blinkers was too
zealous he exceeded his instructions
you must give me the opportunity to
explain

  themajor returned gloomily to his
seat laid his revolvers on the table and
passively awaited the explanation
trenwyck took up the subject of the
seeds described the manner in which
they came into his possession and told
what he intended doing with them
major wickers injured dignity was
marooned in 



lost in a sudden and absorbing fear for
trenwycks sanity

     merciful heavens  whispered the
major hoarsely  is it possible that in
this year of grace  there is one sen-
sible man who will put any faith in such
a lot of rubbish  

   blinkers and i believe in it an-
swered trenwyck steadily

   then you and blinkers are entitled
to a couple of guardians

   i cannot shut my eyes to the proof
tapscott was snuffed out the thief van-
ished and now the baron has followed
both of them into the past

   bosh   wheezed the major  the
baron lost his nerve and ran away in
spite of you and blinkers youre daft
trenwyck clean daft let me have a
look at those wonderful seeds

  blinkers in response to trenwycks
request had removed from his vest
pocket the paper containing the eight
seeds he had left he was holding the
packet in his hand and trenwyck mo-
tioned him to show them to the major

  the major wearing a smile half-
pitying and wholly incredulous poured
himself a drink started to raise the
glass to his lips and suddenly set it
down again

   there they are major said blink-
ers unfolding the packet and stepping
closer so that major wickers could
see the seeds they look harmless
enough but theres a hocus-pocus of
fifty years wrapped up in every one of
those little grains

  the major took the paper eyed the
seeds cynically then quickly slipped
them into the glass of water a pre-
sentiment of further trouble darted
through trenwycks brain and he
darted forward with outstretched hand

  major he cried in consternation
 what are you about to do 

   stand right where you are tren-
wyck commanded the major waving
him back you too blinkers im
going to prove that the baron ran away
of his own accord-and incidentally
that you gentlemen are victims of your
own disordered imagination

   he lifted the glass a quick sparkle of
determination showing in his eyes

   stop wickers shouted trenwyck
frantically leaping toward him

  the glass was already at the majors
lips trenwyck caught it away but too
late a choppy defiant laugh echoed
through the room

  another moment and trenwyck and
blinkers were alone staring dumbly at
each other across the spot where the
major had just stood a groan escaped
trenwycks lips the glass fell crashing
from his hand and he dropped limply
across the table

chapter vi

a double departure for the past

  the baron was gone and the major
had followed him both had been pro-
jected four hundred years into the past
what was to happen when they met in
those old times afforded trenwyck
much material for gruesome specula-
tion

  he was glad the major had left his
revolvers and ammunition behind if
the duel was fought in that other age it
would have to be with crossbows two-
handed swords or blunderbusses and
there was the chance that these un-
familiar weapons would make the
combat less sanguinary

  from worrying about the major and
the baron trenwyck fell to worrying
about blinkers and himself myste-
rious disappearances even in spain are
not allowed to pass without investiga-
tion

  in the present instance there were
two powerful governments to force the
hands of the authorities trenwyck
and blinkers could hardly avoid becom-
ing entangled if they tarried in burgos
so they deemed it expedient to get away
as quickly as possible

  trenwyck appropriated the majors
guns they were beautiful weapons
silver chased and had the initials
ii w-horace wickers - wrought
into the stocks

  trenwyck settled their reckoning at
the fonda marched along the row of
waiters scullions and stable boys and
tipped impartially after which he and
blinkers climbed into the old bus and
were rattled away to the station
blinkers had suggested that it was a
propitious moment to take their own
the argosy



leap into the dark but his friend was not

in the mood for it	  

  they were to have a night ride to
madrid and thought luck was with
them when thev chanced upon a vacant
compartment before the train leit the
burgos station however zimmerman s
square-jawed face appeared in the door
and he crawled over them into the car-
riage	    

  if he recognized them in the dim light
he gave no sign after stowing his
luggage in the racks he settled into a
distant corner and presumably went to

sleep-	

  plis presence gave trenwyck a feeling
of decided discomfort could he by any
possible chance be following trenwyck
and blinkers and keeping them under
surveillance 

  zimmerman could hardly have tailed
to discover that blinkers had called on
the baron not far from the hour of his
disappearance what inference would
zimmerman draw from this if any 

  when they were fairly off on their
journey trenwyck drew the silk curtain
across the hole in the top of the car-
riage and shut off the rays of the dimly
burning lamp

  blinkers slept like a log and snored
resonantly trenwyck passed the time
in fitful cat-naps peering at intervals
at the blot of shadow which was all he
could see of zimmerman

  no morning ever dawned that was
more welcome to trenwyck than the
one that followed the dreary appre-
hensive night at a station where the
train lingered for a period out of all
proportion to the size of the place he
bought a couple of jugs of goats milk

  quietly rousing blinkers trenwyck
gave him one as he took it blinkers
looked significantly toward the sleeping
zimmerman and trenwyck shook his
head to signify that nothing of impor-
tance had happened

  an hour or two before they reached
madrid zimmerman sat up yawned
and phook himself together he and
the other two in the compartment how-
ever might have been total strangers
for all the attention they gave each
other

when the capital was finally reached
the three traveled in the same omnibus

to the hotel de la paix wherever
trenwyck turned he was sure to see the
german not watching him apparently
but merely loitering in his vicinity

  he got more and more upon trcn-
wycks nerves until it grew so serious
that trenwyck could not look at an
alguazil without a shudder of appre-
hension they took lunch at the
hotel de la paix and then trenwyck
hurried poor blinkers away to seville
and cadiz

  they paused for breath in cadiz for
although zimmerman had bobbed up
serenely in seville they missed him at
the seaport but when they had been
rowed to the steamer that was to take
them through the straits to malaga the
first person they saw on gaining the deck
was their nemesis-as studiously indif-
ferent as ever

   i could plant a few more of those
seeds where they would do us a lot of
good tren muttered blinkers darkly

  no you dont  said trenwyck in a
tone there was no mistaking

   but that fellow is camped on our
trail are we going to let him chase us
all over spain  

   im trying to figure out what sort of
a game lies up to trenwyck answered

   and while youre doing your fig-
uring like as not hell land us in one of
these spanish lock-ups

   no if he should try that well fall
back on the seeds ourselves and connect
with that peninsular campaign mix
us a shandygaff blinkers and bring it
out on deck

  trenwyck made it a point to travel
with all materials necessary for the
beverage-excepting the cracked ice
according to bis notion it was the most
harmless and satisfying of ail the con-
coctions invented by man

  the zimmerman riddle was not
solved on the voyage to malaga nor in
malaga itself proceeding on to gran-
ada the travelers quartered themselves
in the siete suelos overlooking the red
walls of the alhambra

  once more they experienced a feeling
of relief-zimmerman had not been iu
evidence since they left malaga the
time had conic when trenwyck could no
longer dilly-dally with the set purpose
that had brought him to spain if he
mabooned in 



was ever to look in on that peninsular
campaign it was advisable to be about
it

  trenwyck could be brave enough in
a pinch but there was something so
uncanny in the way a person slipped the
leash under the spell of those lit tie
seeds that the very thought of it gave
him pause

  as for blinkers he was in no wise
perturbed by the bizarre workings of
tapscotts prescription nothing in the
nature of the unaccountable ever
aroused his concern only the humdrum
and the ordinary could do that

  lie would as cheerfully have accom-
panied trenwyck to the stone age as to
the napoleonic era despite his secret
longings for the nile and the times of
cleopatra there was a rnild excite-
ment in being dogged by zimmerman
whenever zimmerman failed him he
fell back upon veiled hints cunningly
calculated to keep their main object
fresh in tremvycks mind

  in the afternoon of the day of their
arrival at the siete suelos therefore
blinkers received with much delight
trenwycks announcement that the
long-expected moment was at hand
with tingling nerves they set about
their small preparations

  a hamper with materials for a hun-
dred glasses of shandygaff was not the
least important part of trenwycks per-
sonal equipment then there were a
dozen note-books a fountain pen and a
quart bottle of ink  six -size boxes of
colorado maduros and a supply of
matches and a small bag of money in
gold pieces of fifty pesetas these were
all compactly packed for hand carriage

 upon trenwycks person were
various articles necessary and other-
wise including the majors brace of six-
shooters

  trenwyck did not inquire too search-
ing y into the character of blinkers
odds and ends he knew he had a
brace of revolvers - s like the
majors-with cartridges to fit ample
materials for cigarettes a rawhide
riata-relic of his texas days-a water
flask with two collapsible cups and
other things

 at the last moment trenwyck
thought best to allow blinkers con-

siderable latitude then if he landed
at the beginning of the century unpro-
vided for iu any essential particular lie
would have no one but himself to blame
for it

  a muleteer an asturian in a wonder-
ful red paauela and answering to the
name of anselmo was hired for what
purported to be an ordinary ramble
through the hills and the paraphernalia
was loaded upon the panniers of his
patient beast the hotel bill was not
settled the residue of luggage being left
in lieu of the money

  the muleteer desired to know their
pleasure as to the course they should
take

   anywhere in the hills anselmo
trenwyck answered and the little cara-
van got under way

  skirting the beautiful gardens of the
generaliffe they struck inio a lonely
mule path that wound upward through
bleak hills along the bottom of a narrow
barranco or ravine

  it was a wild and rugged country
bare desolate and suggestive of dantes
inferno anselmo a picturesque object
in his bright panuela brigand-like cloak
and laced alfargatas was extremely lo-
quacious -v

  he explained that they were on their
way to the crest of the mountain of the
sun the highest elevation iu the vicin-
ity of granada and he was at great
pains to point out the chair of the moor
and other landmarks and to give some
account of the traditions connected with
them

  blinkers chatted with the fellow in
peon castilian but trenwyck took no
part in the conversation aud listened
only casually had the gay anselmo
been mephistopheles leading them up
the brocken he could hardly have been
more heavily oppressed

  they were passing from the nine-
teenth century in a manner that har-
monized well with their extraordinary
purpose as they proceeded ruins of
ancient structures rose thickly about
them

  ahead and to the left trenwyck took
note of a stone tower in a tolerable
state of preservation his eves were
fixed on this tow-er when a clatter of
hoofs from behind and a startled ex-


the argosy

clamation from blinkers drew his at-
tention		

  zimmerman astride a mule as gal-
loping after them up the barranco
mounted on horses and following him
closelv were two alguazils their white
hats bobbing excitedly as they rode

  yait a leetle shouted zimmer-
man rising in his stirrups

  the tjens darmes repeated the com-
mand in their own tongue emphasizing
it with a wave of their drawn swords

  christopher growled blinkers
reaching for his guns  theyre after
us tren

   leave your guns where they are
said trenwyck -and get up to that old
tower as fast as you can unload the
mule and make everything ready-ill
stay here and parley with them while
youre doing it sing out when you ve
got things in shape blinkers 

  as trenwyck finished he handed his
friend the packet of seeds

  the texan was all activity on the in-
stant anselmo frightened by the hos-
tile manner of the alguazils grabbed his
mule and was for holding it in that spot
until the officers arrived

  blinkers lifted him from his feet and
cast him aside then took hold of the
mule himself and scrambled for the
tower the fact that trenwyck was re-
maining to talk with them in a manner
calmed the officers and acted as an off-
set to these warlike proceedings

  the muleteer rising from where he
had fallen stood inert dividing his be-
wilderment between the vanishing mule
and the approaching riders blinkers
was at the tower and unloading the
plunder when zimmerman drew rein in
front of trenwyck

   herr trenwyck said the german
 you und your friend vill haff to go
back by granata under arrest

   why so  returned trenwyck dis-
sembling to the best of his ability

   y ou haf been suspected oof know-
ing someding aboudt vat has happened
mit baron von lauderbach by burgos
und it is believed dot you can also make
some explanations concerning der vere-
about oof der barons enemy der herr
major

  nonsense cried trenwyck in
great indignation  major wickers
was my friend man as for the baron
i never saw him in my life

  no veil your friend saw him
und aboudt der time vat he vanished
away j haf been following you herr
trenwyck und in your stateroom on der
boat between cadiz and malaga i findt
me dot you carry two refolfers marked
mit der initials oof der herr major ha 
iss it nod so you must go mit us by
granata 

  the alguazils had dismounted and
now came up echoing in their own
tongue the statement that he must
return to the town

   everythings ship-shape tren  
came booming down the hillside from
the tower

   this is an outrage  trcnwyc-k
fumed  but if you insist i suppose
there is nothing for us to do but to
yield 

  then in spanish to the officers

   i will accompany you to the ruins
and explain matters to my friend he
is a little hot-headed and might make
trouble for you if you went alone
this appeared like a reasonable sug-
gestion and they all ascended the slope
the alguazils still keeping on either side
of trenwyck

  blinkers stood in the doorway of the
tower a cup in each hand

   heres that drink you wanted
tren said he handing his friend one
of the cups  whats the matter with
these lads anyhow he added sweep-
ing his eye over zimmerman and the
alguazils

  zimmerman began to talk but tren-
wyck cut into his remarks with the word
now accompanied by a significant
look at blinkers

  at the same instant the two cups were
lifted and drained a sort of haze
caught up everything within trenwycks
line of vision his ears roared as with
deafening thunder blackness descended
and closed- him in the earth shook
under his feet and he felt himself
hurled outward and down down down

          until sensation failed and there was
          nothing but oblivion

 to be continued
the murder of eben canniff

by w bert foster

the champion ofthe doelger crowd and what his espousal of his father s cause did toward

putting a rope around his neck

when eben canniff was elected to
the office oi district attorney
there was no flutter in the political
chicken-roost of denborough

  canniff was known as a good lawyer
a supposedly good party man and he
gave a certain tone to the rest of the
ticket that the most enthusiastic mem-
ber of the  gang  had to admit was
sadly needed

  canniff was a silent taciturn individ-
ual who showed his whole mind or
heart to no man he could not be frank
but that was no reason for the party
managers to believe that he was not
honest

  and within three months the man-
agers or the  doelger crowd  as they
were called awoke to the terrifying fact
that in the new district attorney they
had an uncertain quantity

  lie took his oath of office seriously
and in those first ninety days he dis-
covered just how rank was the crowd
who had misgoverned affairs for some
years in denborough

  and then instead of winking at this
matter or of making a gallery play by
indicting some small boodler he went
at the foontain-head of it all and laid
evidence before the grand jury which
if true and proven in the courts would
send mr graham doelger himself
 over the road

  when the local newspapers breathed
these tidings with awe and the more
distant newsmongers blazoned the story
broadcast with no fear of the doelger
crowd before their eyes burke doelger
saw it

  burke was at harvard how he man-
aged to scrape through the examina-
tions to get there may be better under-
stood when t say that he was six feet
three inches high broad in proportion
and the greatest center rush the college
had ever had on its eleven

  burke was a good-natured giant who

never took his college course seriously
but who considered athletics worth
while as he was a wealthy mans son
the college had been unable to oiler him
any pecuniary inducement indeed the
board never really knew how it came to
secure the prize

  burke might have told them there
was just one person in the world whom
burke doelger worshiped-and it
wasnt a girl

  old graham doelger in his sons
eyes was the greatest man who ever
lived the boy never tired of hearing
liis father tell of his first struggles when
he doelger senior arrived from the old
country

  when it came time for burke to de-
cide what he would do in life graham
doelger had heard or read that a col-
lege educated man had an advantage
over other men and that a diploma was
an open sesame to that society which
had refused to welcome the great cheese
manufacturer himself

  doelger had gone into politics and
ruled the city or thought he did for he
was too simple to see that he was used
by more unscrupulous men to their own
ends but he was not satisfied he
wanted burke his only child to be
something better and greater

  burke had brains enough to know
that he did not come of a family that
took easily to book learning he hated
books but he said

   all right dad what track do you
think id better be trained over

   they all say that theres a place
near boston thats chock full of book
learnin and such replied the old man
wistfully  its a long wavs off--

   well fix that declared burke
 ill take your private ear and run back
and forth frequently i know about
harvard i guess theyll have me
there

  for lie had already been approached
 

the argosy



by certain alumni who had the welfare
of their athletics at heart

  that is ancient history however
when burke heard the stories of the
new district attorney getting after
graham doelger the private car
brought him home to den borough
faster than it ever had before

  he reached the city in time to be
present in court at his fathers exami-
nation	     

  it was terrible to think that that
white-haired old man who looked so
blighted now should be brought on
such a charge before the court of the
city which he had practically governed

  doelger had allowed his name to be
used by his henchmen money had been
looted from the city treasury  if canniff
could prove this the old mans wealth
could not save him for a wave of re-
form opinion was sweeping the state

    i knew youd come burke  gasped
graham doelger as the big fellow slid
into the seat between him and his
lawyer and took the old mans hand

  come you bet id come-from
hades dad growled burke his eyes
flashing whos doing this what
does it mean

  it is that can niff i-dont-just
-understand-it faltered the old
man hanging his head

   does he really mean to try to indict
you muttered burke

   im-im afraid so he says he
isnt after money

its a dirty political trick gasped
burke  hes trying to make himself
solid for the gubernatorial nomination
 i-i dont know stammered his
father

   by god if he does this ill have his
life  burke burst out and there were
many who heard him

  the court session-the first scene of
a drama bound to be intensely interest-
ing to den borough-droned on in-
fluenced as lie was by party prejudice
and bv the knowledge that he was ex-
pected to stand up for the  boss the
magistrate was finally forced by the
astute district attorney to hold graham
doelger for trial

  by the time the fight over the bail
was over it was growing dusk in the
corridors of the court-house

  as eben canniff stern-faced tari-
turn clear-eyed as ever came out of
the court-room after most of the crowd
and the prisoner himself had gone he
was suddenly confronted by a huge
figure whose pallid face and blazing eyes
were those of a madman

  you scoundrel hissed burke in
the attorneys face  if you dont drop
this youll be the sorriest man who ever
wore boots 

  the district attorney did not change
the expression of his liatchet-like
countenance lie brushed by the young
giant and without hastening his pace
in the least went down the steps and
entered the old building a short dis-
tance along the street in which he had
his office

  several loungers had noted the en-
counter in the hallway of the court-
house they had marked burke
doelgers attitude and noted his words

  and perhaps eben canniff took the
threat seriously too when he reached
his office after putting his papers in
the safe he sat down in his hat and
coat before his desk and rang up judge
blaine

  judge blaine was the senior justice of
the county a man of irreproachable
character a man with whom canniff
had advised before taking this first step
in the punishment of the boodling ring

   i am threatened he said over the
phone to the judge  they are mad
enough to do some foolish thing 
doubt but you have the combination
of my safe and the papers are all there
 have nothing personal against poor
old doelger he was merely a catspaw
but his son burke thinks i have

  that was all he said judge blaine
remembered it clearly afterward

  some men in the street had seen the
lawyer enter and walk up the single
flight to his office his shadow had
crossed the drawn blind once or twice

  then a bulkier shadow had darted
into the doorway and disappeared in the
darkness of the stair flight

  by and by the electric light which
had been turned on in can niffs office
when he entered was extinguished no-
body saw either the lawyer or the big-
ger figure which had followed him come
out of the building
the murder of eben canniff



  canniff was not a married man and
there was nobody to be worried over his
non-appearance at home but he had an
office boy and at eight oclock the next
morning that young man ran shrieking
and blubbering from the old building
and quickly gathered a startled crowd

  he had found eben canniff dead
upon the floor of his office the at-
torney had fallen or been hung from
his chair

  later it was decided that the murder
must have occurred immediately after
his brief talk over the phone with
judge blaine in falling canniff had
dragged the transmitter he had hung
the receiver upon it and still clasped
the nickel standard when he fell

  there was a pool of blood on the rug
his chair had been overthrown and like-
wise an iron dictionary stand from the
deep gash in his head the blood had
spurted upon everything for several
yards around

  it was a most foul and horrible mur-
der even the previously lukewarm
newspapers of denborough took up the
hue and cry for the apprehension and
punishment of the one who was guilty

  and before noon every soul that had
arrived at years of discretion within
the precincts of the city of denborough
knew who the guilty man was

  a dozen witnesses to burke doelgers
threats in the court-house were ready
with affidavits half as many more
could swear to seeing the big fellow fol-
low canniff into the building where the
district attorney was found slain

  public opinion demanded that the
harvard center rush be put behind the
bars of the county jail at once there
was no bail for such a creature and
the doelger crowd were on the run
any way	f

  old graham doelger was shaken out
of the dazed condition into which his
own arrest had thrown him

  the coroner refused bail it was true
but graham doelger hurried to obtain
the best legal help in the state for his
accused son had he known burke to
be guilty he would have done the same
probably and burke assured him that
he had not killed canniff

  to do the thing was in his heart that
evening the vonng fellow did not

deny that indeed he would have ad-
mitted it to the reporters had not his
legal adviser forbidden his speaking

  burke had followed eben canniff to
liis office determined to force the at-
torney to give up the prosecution of
his father he went as far as the office
door and then feariug what he might
do to the smaller and slighter man if
the latter refused the big fellow tied
temptation postponing the interview
until he should be calmer

  but to make an admission like this
would be fatal it was the work of the
prosecution to prove burkes connec-
tion with the murder

  there was a bare possibility that cir-
cumstantial evidence could not convict
him of murder in the first degree in
other words there was a narrow chance
for the sentence to be life imprisonment
rather than death by the electric chair

  a post mortem examination had
shown no other mark upon can niffs
body than the wound in his head and
no weapon had been found

  indeed the physicians did not en-
tirely -agree regarding that wound

  in itself some said the blow would
not have killed the murdered man it
must have stunned him and he had iain
there during the night slowly bleeding
to death

  on the other hand other of the medi-
cal examiners declared that death must
have been almost if not quite instanta-
neous it was true canniff had bled a
great deal and such wounds do not
bleed much after the victims heart has
stopped its action

  the spattering of the blood however
seemed to prove that it had spurted in
great quantity from the wound and in
that case much could have been lost in
a very few moments

  however despite these small dis-
agreements in the medical testimony
public opinion declared that burke
doelger was guilty and there was none
to rise in denial of the charge save his
broken white-haired old father himself
an indicted criminal

  grandy edwards would have lilted to
do so he had been burkes chum at
the local schools and he knew just how
good-hearted and noble a fellow burke
doelger was


the argosy

  when the city rang with the story of
the murder grundy was horrified he
almost fainted when his chief gave him
the assignment to interview burke m
his cell in the county jail

  my god leggett gasped the re-
porter  give it to some other man
burke and i were churns

   so much the better he  talk to
you said the editor who would have
sacrificed his own grandmother for a

news item

  grandison edwards would have gone
to his own hanging more cheerfully
than he visited the county jail on that
occasion he sent in his name to burke
and it was evident that burke forgot
that his old friend was a newspaper
man

  it was really the first ray in the
darkness-this visit of grandys the
latter was the only old friend who had
come to see him

  grandy felt like a thief but he was
heartily sympathetic and came away
from the jail with the idea that burke
doelger was not guilty

   they all believe i did it burke
said quietly  that is all but poor old
dad

  u even the lawyers seem to go to
work on that basis instead of looking
for the real murderer they are endeav-
oring to throw all the dust possible in
the eyes of the prosecution and base
ill hope of acquittal on the inability of
the state conclusively to prove me
guilty

   my god grandy i dont want to be
released from a murder charge merely
because they cant actually prove me
guilty  want to be honestly cleared

  this appeal made a telling point in
edwards story when he handed it in to
the bugle but the editor penciled it
out

  the bugle was not running the risk
of appearing to back up the doelger
crowd now that the regime was bound
to be changed and the reformers were
coming in

  secretly however grandy remained
impressed with the truth of burkes
statement he believed his old friend
guiltless

  but a belief based on mere sentiment
would not go far in such a case

  grandy was not an inactive fellow
his work gave him opportunities of
talking with all manner of people and
he had an open sesame to all manner of
queer places

  lie determined to look over the scene
of canniffs murder himself although
the bugles police reporter had done that
already

  unfortunately just as he came down
to the old building in which cannilf had
had his office so many years a lire broke
out in the upper hallway and although
his badge carried him past the fire lines
the department would not let him into
the building until the fire was out

  canniffs office was smoke-filled but
the fire had begun in a closet in the hall
and seemed to have no connection with
the murder of the attorney even in
grandy edwards suspicious mind

  he could not learn at once what had
started the conflagration so he hung
about the neighborhood until after the
insurance people had examined the
place and it was this hanging about
that first set grandys mind in the
groove which later had so great a bear-
ing on the murder mystery

  next to the old rookery that had
come so near being destroyed by fire
was a little cafe patronized by the
loungers of the neighborhood it was
a good place in which to pick up news
as grandy knew of old

  while he was there a lineman of the
electric lighting company came in and
over his beer began to talk with the
barkeeper

  grandy sidled up and listened you
never know how much of importance
may be unintentionally dropped in
casual conversation

  the lineman had been sent over to
repair the wires in the building where
the fire had occurred in the opinion
of the fire marshal the conflagration of
the morning had been caused by a live
wire the insulation of which had become
worn

   an i reckon hes right said the
repairer  theres a mess of wires in
that closet ive got an afternoons
job

  and while the lineman did his work
in the closet he had an interested spec-
tator in grandy edwards
the murder of eben canniff

ill

  grandy was as full of questions as he
could stick the lineman was inclined
to be grouty despite a big cigar the re-
porter gave him before his catechizing
was complete

  burke doelger had been held for the
murder of canniff on the coroners find-
ing the public prosecutor who had
been eben can niffs assistant in office
was in no hurry to ask for an indict-
ment the finding of the coroners jury
would hold until the case against burke
was in better shape

  but to his surprise-to the amaze-
ment of the whole city in fact-dod-
gers counsel suddenly moved in the
matter application was made for
burkes release from custody on the
ground that there was no evidence to
support the accusation upon which the
young man had been arrested

   theyd show better taste by wait-
ing was the legal concensus of opinion

  there is never anything to be gained
bv hurrying the public prosecutor

   besides there is always a chance of
something turning up to favor the ac-
cused as time goes on delay benefits
the prisoner ilis own lawyers seem to
wish to railroad him through

  but the public-or that part of it
which could crowd into the court-room
-was still more amazed when the lead-
ing counsel for the defense in address-
ing the justice not only declared his
client guiltless of the crime laid at his
door but broadly hinted that he was
prepared to offer evidence proving this
amazing fact

  the course of the defense seemed
inexplicable instead of taking the ag-
gressive in this way it was expected
that burkes lawyers would harp upon
the fact that his absolute connection
with the murder could not be proven by
eye-witnesses

   the nature of this evidence you
claim to possess queried the bench
of the confident lawyer

  i have three witnesses if it please
your honor declared the attorney
 one is a gentleman who first suspected
the facts in the case-mr edwards
yonder engaged on the ienborough
bugle

  another is a lineman and repairing
electrician in the employ of the lighting

company the third is dr abram
little -pointing to a professional-
looking man who sat beside the re-
porter

   with your permission i will call dr
little first dr little is on the medical
board of the state penitentiary it has
been his privilege to examine and pro-
fessionally pronounce dead most of the
criminals that have received the ex-
treme penalty of the law in our state
during the last ten years

   dr little has examined the body of
our late district attorney eben can-
niff the medical testimony given at
the inquest showed more than the usual
discrepancies no two of the medical
examiners agreed upon all points re-
garding eben canniffs-er-taking
away

   because my client in the heat of
youthful anger threatened the unfortu-
nate man who is now dead he was at
once accused of murder-even before
it was proven that murder had been
committed will the court hear dr
little

  the court would for it as well as
the spectators was on the qui rive it
was plain that the astute attorney was
working up no legal  bluff

  under his questioning dr little
showed the number of bodies he had ex-
amined following their death in the
chair offering voluminous notes regard-
ing the state of the various organs and
the condition of the flesh

  then he said while the dramatic ten-
sion was too great to be expressed in
mere words

   it is my opinion that the body of
eben canniff shows in every important
particular the same indications which
marked the bodies of those criminals
who have been electrocuted in this state
during the last decade

   there are no exterior evidences of
the electric current as i have said but
to the trained eye the manner of mr
can niffs death is conclusively proven

   he was killed by the shock of an
electric current passing through his
body strong enough to have killed ten
men  

  the testimony of the lineman and of
grandy edwards followed the stories
given out by judge blaine and the


the argosy

other men whom the prosecution in-
tended to use as witnesses in the convic-
tion of burke doelger were skilfully
utilized by the defense

  judge blaine had told how he had
spoken over the phone with the dead
district attorney and the men in the
street testified to the sudden putting
out of the electric light in canmirs
office

   that light your honor declared
the lawyer  was the shaded bulb over
mr canniffs desk

   he sat there in his hat and coat
ready to go home while he telephoned
to judge blaine as he completed his
message he hung the receiver on the
shaft of the telephone standard and as
he placed the latter ou his desk reached
up to turn out his electric light

   as the testimony of the lineman
and his letter from the electric light
company proves-as well as the con-
tributory evidence of the recent fire in
the building and the report of the city
fire marshal on the same-the worn
insulation of the lighting wire in the
closet on the floor with mr canniffs
office doubtless caused a grounding of
the current and the metal trimmings of

the globe over the dead mans desk were

heavily charged with the fluid

   as cannitr turned out his light he
touched this metal instantly his body
short-circuited the electric current his
right hand still grasping the telephone
standard in falling to the floor his
head struck the dictionary stand and
was cut

   your honor i ask that my client be
set free at once there was  murder
eben canniffs death was caused by an
act of god with which is found some
contributory negligence by man

  the death of our brilliant district
attorney eben canniff is a public mis-
fortune he undoubtedly made ene-
mies by his determination to root out
the evil of misgovernrnent that has
sapped the political strength of our
community however to hold my client
an hour under this awful charge and
after these proofs are laid before the
court is an injustice that i do not be-
lieve my brother -with a bow to the
public prosecutor- will countenance

  he sat down half an hour later
burke walked from the court-house a
free man with his broken and white-
haired father leaning upon his arm

synopsis of chapters previously published

   richard wallace is a young college graduate thrown upon his own resources in new york he
has failed in various pursuits and has reached his last cent at this crisis he is notified that an uncle
has died bequeathing him a cattle ranch in the wilds of arizona

    wallace works his way to new orleans and there seeks to got money enough from the ranch to reach
arizona he receives discouraging news from the foreman miguel but no cash in reply to his letter
taking his last few dollars to buy a supply of food he stows away on a freight train loaded with cotton
for san francisco california

chapter v

my troubles seem only to begin

being in total darkness  could not
tell the hours i slept well on top
of a bale of cotton and was awakened
by the jar of getting under way

this

  the rumbling continued there were
jolts and jars the noise of couplings
and then a steady motion and rumble
on the track that indicated we were
going forward

  the only way i had of judging time
was by my hunger

ttory began in the july issue of the argosy which will he mailed to any address on receipt

                                      of  cents
the hoodoo ranch



  i forgot to say that one of my pur-
chases was of necessity a can-opener
whenever  felt hungry  would take a
can trusting to luck whether it was
salmon or beef and open it eating all
 wanted

  when  was hungry again  judged
about six hours had passed

  when i was sleepy  lay down to rest
and when  awoke according to my cal-
culation about eight hours had passed

   so it was according to my calculation
 had been rumbling along about three
days i was growing stiff and cramped
and wished  could run about and ease
up my muscles

  then there came some more jolts and
jars we were shifting or being put
into another train i didnt care i
knew we were going to san francisco

  again there came the steadiness of
onward motion and the speed seemed
greater than before

  we had gone on thus for two meals
my only clock and calendar when there
was a terrific shock that hurled me
against the front end of the car and then
anotherand a crunchinggrating sound
and before  could realizewhat had hap-
pened the ear swung to one side swayed
from right to left and then turned
turtle

  i heard the splintering of wood but
the weight of the cotton as the car stood
on its head almost killed me and i be-
came unconscious

  when at last  recovered conscious-
ness  was not lying under the cotton in
the top of the car but on top of it the
cotton had been disarranged and the
car was light

  i crawled to the edge of the load and
found that the strain from rolling down
some embankment or falling from a
trestle had sprung the door one bale
of cotton was missing

  i reached out and got my jute bag
with what was left of my eatables and
worked my way down to the door i lost
my hold on the cotton and slipped i
fell on the missing bale of cotton which
had fallen under the door

  the air was warm and dry i took
a few deep breaths to fill out my lungs
after the stifling air of the car and then
looked about me

  three cars lay there mine alone right

      	a

side up one was on its side and the
third was completely upside down

  there had evidently been a rear-end
collision for the back of the last ear
was smashed the platform was gone
and the iron ladder twisted into all
kinds of shapes

  the track was about fifty feet above
me and the bank down which the cars
had plunged was torn and plowed up by
the weight of the loads

  i clambered to the top and gazed upon
the veriest scene of desolation it had
ever been my lot to look upon there
was not a house in sight uot a barn-
nothing that looked like a habitation

  acres of withering grass was all i
could see waving in a wind that was
hot enough to bake it without the aid
of a blistering sun

  i looked as far as i could see in every
direction aud could not make out a sign
of anything alive

   well  said to myself  i am no
worse off if i can reach some kind of
town and learn where i am this is not
louisiana that is certain its a cinch
im in texas

  i stood for a moment longer contem-
plating the scene

   funny they left the cars i said
 but theres nobody here to steal the
cotton i suppose they will send a gang
now then which way to the nearest
station  if i go back i am going far-
ther away from mackinville if i go
forward i draw nearer arizona

  forward i started my jute bag over
my shoulder it was some lighter than
it had been  wondered what  should
have done if the stuff had not lasted till
i reached san francisco

   trudged on and on and grew parched
with thirst i saw no signs of water
until i had gone perhaps five miles
then i perceived a few trees ahead and
trudged on joyfully for the lines on
which they grew told me they were be-
side a little stream

  xnd i found it so i discovered a
shady spot under a tree right at the side
of a brook and sat down to eat first
i quenched my thirst and then  opened
a can of beef and a can of tomatoes
putting salt and pepper on these i
made a first-class meal and drank my fill
of the sweet water


the argosy

   i washed the two cans thoroughly
 filled them with water and journeyed
 on

   i walked i suppose ahout four miles
 more drinking from the cans when
 thirsty then i saw ahead a shanty
 on the side of the track going some
 distance farther i saw a house and a
 little store

    at last  said to myself joyinlly
  i am in luck i wont have to sleep
 out in the desert to-night wonder
 what place that is

   the first building i reached was the
 little box-like affair- near the track the
 door stood open and looking inside 
 saw a man of about forty silting there
 with his feet on a box and a pipe in his
 mouth

  do stranger tramped fui- was
 his greeting

 not very far i answered only
 from the wreck

  holv smoke did they leave you
 behind

  yes but i dont mind a little
 thing like that

  come in ill flag a train fer ye
 but i have lost everything my
 baggage and money and ticket are all in
 the train

   this was a taudom shot for  did not
 know whether it was a passenger train
 or another freight that hit us

   wall ye kin git them any time
 ill explain ter the conductor

   i began to feel as if  had been hurled
 into luck after all

    what place is this  i asked
 this yar place why this is
 greens corners

    are you the station-master

    wall sorter ye see this aint noth-
 in but a flag station im all they is to

and is greens corners in texas

   yep jest a few miles this side er

  i did not ask him which side of hous-
ton we were on but wondered

said  what you carry in that bag

   i found it down the track some
tramp had it of course  found some
canned goods in it there are cans of
beef some of salmon and some of to-
matoes

green

   by gol they could dont ye want

take a look at a big ranch i own in ari-
zona you dont think there will be

   will there be a passenger train to-
day  

   not a good one not yourn you

  i accompanied mr green to his store
apparently nothing had been disturbed
in some time for every thing was covered
the hoodoo ranch



with dust but dust gets into every-
thing down here and  doubt mans
ability to keep it out for one day i
enjoyed a bountiful supper and found
airs green an affable and pleasant
woman

  we chatted during the evening heard
a local go by and mr green remarked
that a freight would be due soon this
was their life listening for trains that
seldom stopped

  bacon and creamed potatoes good
coffee and a great plate of luscious ber-
ries with cream made a fair breakfast
at ten oclock the passenger came along
and mr green flagged it the con-
ductor wanted to know what was up

   yer see conductor said mr
green u this gent was on the express
what run inter that freight yistiddy lie
got out ter look en ther dura tiling
went off an left him

   he walked here an stayed all night
he had first-class passage with cowpons
fur meals an sleeper but everything
is in that train he aint got no money
ner ticket ner nothin

  u thats a bad predicament to be in
out here said the conductor smiling
 i suppose about ten thousand damages
might satisfy you 

  i knew this was a feeler

   i dont want damages i replied
 so much as  do haste i am wanted
at mackinville arizona where i own
extensive properties  really ought to
be there now

   i guess the company will stand by
what i do he said   have room so
come with me ill drop you at mack-
inville

  luxury thou art a jewel

  i received a pullman seat a ticket for
a sleeper and a meal check

   make yourself perfectly at home
said the conductor u you are as wel-
come to all the comforts just the same
as though you had bought that ticket
my report will cover that

   richard i said as the train sped
on  once in awhile the devil takes care
of his own he seems to be a friend of
yours

  therewas no more trouble after that

i lived sumptuously and slept well and
eventually having ridden through cac-
tus mcsquite and drifting sands the

t rain slowed up at a little station where
i knew an express would not stop

      this is mackinville said the con-
 ductor  good-by hope you have
 had a pleasant ride

     very and i thank ou i said

 for once  had told the truth

     i alighted from the car and looked
 around

 mackinville seemed to be pretty much
 on the straggle the streets were
 crooked and there were more street-
 than were necessary for the accommo-
 dation of the number of houses

 there was a general store and the
 post office was in that in the next
 building there was a dentist and next a
 drug store then a one-story affair
 with the sign on the door

jaffry  jones attorneys

 i walked into the office a tall raw-
 boned man sat in a wooden chair read-
 ing a legal paper

  i am richard wallace i said  is
 this mr jaffry  

 no im jones glad to see you
 mr wallace your hand glad to see
 you jaffry is out to lunch hell be
 back sit down

 mr jaffry came in soon alter my
 arrival jones introduced me

  ha ha did you get bit on cot-
 ton   laughed jaffiry

 f cotton i never speculate in cot-
 ton

  see that hear that jones ke
 never does what did i tell your that
 fellow in new orleans was an impostor

 then he told me all about it

   would never think of asking a
 favor of a stranger i said

 we got down to business pretty
 quickly

 i cared little to hear how my uncle
 died i was satisfied that he had died
 at all i wanted to get out to my ranch
 where i could breathe like a free man
 the owner of all he surveys

 i gave them the letter the certificate
 and my fathers picture

 by jove jones that looks enough
 like old tom to lie himself when he was
 young said mr jaffry

 the evidence was sufficient and jaffry
 said

  mr jones will take you out to the

i


the argosy

ranch by the way mr wallace yon
will perhaps want a legal adviser many
do around here we should be pleased to
have you for a client

   then count me as one i said  it
i need a lawyer mr jaffry i shall call
on you

  k thank you

  a boy brought a buckboard to the
door it was drawn by two texas
ponies tough wiry but not at ail
handsome

   the proper papers will be prepared
to-morrow mr wallace and we will
drive out to see you

   all right mr jaffry ill be on the
lookout for you

  i got into the buckboard after jones
 asked him all sorts of questions elicit-
ing the following information my
ranch contained two thousand acres it
lav to the westward of mackinville about
twenty miles mackinville was the
nearest post office though there were a
few small villages between

  the ponies trotted away at a good
gait the road was dusty i was
parched again the air was too dry
after a life in xew york my throat
filled with dust

  we passed mesquite groves and great
cacti grouped together as if for mutual
protection

  as we decreased the distance between
us and my ranch the scenery grew more
desolate we reached a place where
there was not a house in sight grass
was growing and cattle were nibbling at
it but it was withered with the baking
sun and had little if any nourishment
in it

  there was a line of mesquite with a
break in it we drove through the
break

  here was a small adobe dwelling one
storv high big enough for two rooms if
the rooms were very small

  desolation was rife not a bit of
water not a spear of grass that had not
been blighted by the heat

    this said jones grandiloquently
waving his hand all around him is
your splendid property this house the
old man built himself

  my heart sank down into the heel of
one of my shoes this-this vista of
drifting sand and smothered grass-my

fortune this pile of mud my home
not a soul to speak to

  i got down from the buckboard and
swallowed hard it was tough the
old fool did have a grudge against me
after all

   thought of new york with its bril-
liant lights the display of fine dresses
on the avenues the places of amuse-
ment the sparkling conversation at the
press club to which i still belonged
and then-miles upon miles of desert a
lot of scrawny starving cattle a few
sheep that were dying and a mud hut
to live in-alone

  i had ten cents in my pocket

   youre a lucky man wallace said
jones  youve got the biggest ranch
in arizona

   it looks to me  said as i contem-
plated the vast waste  that my uncle
has left me all of arizona who owns
whats left  

  jones laughed and drove away leav-
ing me alone-alone with my big ranch
near mackinville arizona

chapter vi

i stumble upon a mystery

  i watched the disappearing buck-
board as jones drove down the lane to
the mesquites and when he had turned
into the main road i laughed a grim
sardonic laugh

   at last  said  i am monarch of
all i survey

  for a moment the spirit of desolation
seized me but i was not of a despair-
ing nature and soon rallied

   there is this much about it i told
myself  richard the old man left you
this ranch probably because he didnt
have anything any worse to leave 
wonder if he planted a curse anywhere
around here the future will tell that
now richard explore your magnificent
palace

  to tell the truth  was somewhat
agreeably surprised when  entered the
place from the outside the house
looked more like a heap of sun-baked
mud than a habitation the entrance
had no door but was simply an irregular
opening so low that  had to stoop to
get inside
the hoodoo ranch



  this led to a room larger than the
entire thing seemed to be from an outer
view in this room there was a bed and
two wooden chairs and a small table
on this table there were a few old papers
on agriculture and grazing

  in a corner there was a mesquite bush
cut to form a sort of lial -tree and on
this there hung a coat a sombrero an
old rifle and a pistol near the tree
stood a pair of heavy boots

  the next room was about the same in
size and in this there was a table and
two wooden chairs of the same make
as those in the first room around the
walls were pegs on which hung sides of
bacon a couple of hams bunches of
sage dried apples and other things i
did not recognize

  in one corner of this room the
kitchen a crude attempt had been made
to build a closet in a corner this was
a triangular affair with a door on
opening this i discovered some dishes
knives forks and spoons

  a few pots and pans were hanging
near the old cook-stove that stood at
one side its chimney being a hole in
the roof through which the stove-pipe
went up straight

  the spirit of adventure that seemed
to go with the rest of my experience now
settled upon me and  began to relish
the joke my uncle had played on me

   i had gone to a terrific lot of trouble
to reach that ranch  had worked like
a slave on a ship had smothered in
cotton had lied owed vidal three
weeks board and now that i was here
i determined to make the best of it

   at any rate i said  i must have
some cattle and sheep if the worst
comes i can eat them

  what bothered me was i saw no men
i wondered where miguel my superin-
tendent was

   was hungry i hustled around and
back of the house found a small pile of
gnarled pine sticks unfit for anything
bitt firewood  took some of these and
found an old paper and soon had a roar-
ing fire

  i sliced some bacon and found some
potatoes and cooked a couple of them
i found coffee tea and sugar half a
can of condensed milk was also in the
cupboard

   ill get along i reckon  i said to
myself

  supper over it was growing dark and
 began to feel rather lonesome  lit
my pipe for with all my poverty i was
never without a little tobacco and went
outside to smoke

   took a chair with me and tilting
against the adobe wall leaned back and
contemplated my future life

   it isnt going to be the most hila-
rious in the world i said to myself
 but it is a living and ill wring some-
thing from this old grass bakery before
i am through with it

  i heard the soft patter of an unshod
horse and turning saw a dark-featured
fellow apparently about my own age
galloping toward me

  you take him easy that life
senor he said

   i feel as if i could take anybodys
life without any trouble at all i re-
plied  live around here

  he laughed showing two rows of
white teeth

   yes i live here but you senor
you make free

   well confound it the thing is mine
so i suppose i can lean against it
everything seems to be lean around
here

  ho then you are seiior wal-
lace  

 well i suppose i am a senor to you
 own this blooming ranch any way
good yer good i am miguel
sebastian i was superintendent for
the old man

  oh you are miguel eh well let
me congratulate you on the fact that
you speak english a heap better than
you write it

   si sehor i talk with men and
learn but  never went to school

   so thats it well miguel get off
that horse get a chair and lets con-
verse happily upon the situation let
us commune with each other about cat-
tle and sheep and sing a dittv about
 the desert life is the life for me
come miguel light up and talk

  he was applying a match to a
cheroot

  he let the horse wander where it
would and got a chair placing it near
mine
the argosy

   are von the only in an on the

 ranch   i inquired

   oh no senor many my brother
he is in charge of the horses and sheep
in the hills his name is manuel
then jose niclco he is with three boys
down with the cattle and i am there
also but i see to all senor  see to

   i have no doubt yon are faithful
 how many head of cattle have we  

   two thousand

  thars a lot how many sheep
   one thousand

   wow how many horses 

  five hundred ponies

  good how many hogs

   no hogs only a half-breed who eats
 everything his name it is dumfer
 he is no good he is with manuel

   then the ranch is really worth
something

  oh yes ver good ranch for ari-
zona some time much rain then grass
good an wool good the cattle they
get fat good money then this year
no rain wool coarse an short no good
wait till rain come then be good

   any neighbors  

   such a way like that he said
pointing toward the north  mr be-
thune ver nice man ver nice an
the senorita ver nice

   how old is this very nice girl  
 oh some time twenty maybe
 twenty-two

   looked around me again if this
wasnt a dandy place for a girl twenty-
two years old i was willing to swallow a
lump of my own ranch i had swallowed
some any way

    look here i said  i cant find any
 drinking water

   not here old man he never drank
any water he get whisky down to
mackinville

   that was his drink eh but what
about making coffee and tea i found
in a barrel outside some water that
looked and tasted like stagnant rain
water i used some it wouldnt hurt
after it was boiled

   old man he earn- water from the
creek over there yes deep some
place big falls pretty place

   we must improve that that
wont do where do you sleep  

   we got a little shack down in
meadow yes logs we live in that

   i think you had better move in with
me then we can talk over matters
evenings

   as you say senor

  he rode away about nine and being
wear after my day of excitement and
the ioug ride i went to bed i slept
like a iog scarcely stirring once i
heard a peculiar cry as of a dog i
learned afterward that it was the cry of
a hungry coyote

  in the morning while i was getting
breakfast i heard the clatter of hoofs
again and went to the door it wras
miguel and he had a fine young pony
with him saddled and bridled

   you take a look at your ranch
senor he asked i brought a pony
for you

   i thank you miguel have rou had
your breakfast

  yes i have had breakfast senor
shall i wait for you 

   yes

  i swallowed my breakfast got on the
ponys back and we started off

   shall not go into a wearisome de-
tailed account of my long dusty ride
over my possessions it was in reality
a vast domain had it been well
watered undoubtedly it would make its
owner rich

  there was about as much prospect of
making it better as there was of
carrying it to new york

  for a mile on the south the line ran
straight marked by pine posts painted
white set at such a distance from one
another that from any one you could
see another in either direction then
there was a peculiar turn and it ran on
a slant to the north and the northern
boundary was irregular

  the eastern boundary was the main
road that led from mackinville to pres-
cott having turned from a westerly
to a northerly direction at santa rosa

  my ranch comprised all sorts of land
there were hills covered with pine
there was a gorge through which a
pretty stream tumbled and foamed
the gorge was about a hundred feet
deep in some places and in others less
or more the stream so miguel told me
emptied into the colorado
the hoodoo ranch



  i saw my herds and though they were
thin they did-not seem to he in a weak
condition

  i left miguel talking to manuel his
brother and jogged toward a house i
saw not a great distance from rny bor-
der miguel told me it was where mr
bethune lived and i wanted to get
acquainted with my nearest neighbor

  as i clattered up to the door a girl
with her face out of sight in a huge sun-
bonnet was just coming from the door
with a pail evidently going after water
she heard my horse gave a startled
glance and ran back into the house

  the house itself was a much more
comfortable looking one than mine it
was built of logs and very substantially
built too

  in a moment a tottering old man
came to the door in his hand there
was a pistol

   not going to shoot before you know
me are you  i asked as i dismounted

  the old man looked at me a moment
with dim ees

   thank god  he cried  i thought
you were de paro

  then he turned and tottered back
into the house

   eunice eunice  he said  it is
not de paro thank god  

   but to-morrow-to-morrow oh
my god  i heard the girl sobbing

   it is evident richard  said to
myself ie that there is something radi-
cally wrong here and especially with
de paro i am not acquainted with 
senor de paro but whoever he is he
is persona non grata in this place well
do we go in or return home to wonder
what the trouble is  

   stood debating with myself when
the old man came out

   stranger he said in a trembling
voice  wont you come in

  i tied my pony to a stake near the
door and entered the girl had east
aside her sunbonnet and i saw that she
had been weeping not merely the
little show of emotion she had exhibited
upon my arrival but there were tear
stains and pale cheeks and other evi-
dences that some great trouble was on
her mind

  the old man was just the same his
dim old eyes were filled with tears when

 lie looked at the girl and his voice broke
 into a quaver every few minutes

   i could not as a stranger ask what
 was the trouble as they were evidently
 trying to keep it from me still i knew
 that nothing short of a tragedy would
 catise so much emotion

   the conversation was short and i
 introduced myself first saying that
 miguel had informed me they lived
 there

   when i left the old man followed me
 to the door

   he stood wringing his hands as if in
 agony and whispered

   m will you be at home in the morn-
 ing sit-or perhaps this evening 

    this evening any way i an-
 swered

    dont speak so loud-she will hear
 i will come and see you before dark
 may v 

    i shall be glad to have you come
 at any time i said

   greatly amazed at what seemed to be
 an indication of some terrible anxiety
 oil the part of the old man and the girl
 i rode homeward

    any way i said  eunice is a
 pretty girl eunice is a pretty name and
 ill do anything the old man wants me
 to there what a fierce resolve 

   i laughed and got myself a bite to
 eat

chapter vii

listed to a strange story and
spend a terrjjle moment

   i was sitting with my chair tilted
 back against my beautiful adobe house
 about half-past four when i saw the old
 man coming along the road he was
 driving a pony to a buckboard and
 through the mesquite i could watch his
 bent old form his head would every
 few minutes drop on his breast and then
 he would shake it sadly

   reaching the mesquite gate heturned
 in and i rose to greet him

    you kept your word mr bethune
 i said

   he stepped down from the buckboard
 and ljft the pony to his own devices

    ah mr wallace he began  if you
 had carried the load that i have had on
 my heart for two years and had afcen


the argosy

to-day the first frank and manly face
the first face you could trust in all that
time you would keep your word also
yes thank vou i will sit down i am
not as strong as i was once

  that was an evident fact the poor
old fellow sank into a chair and to my
utter amazement burst into tears

   poor eunice poor eunice  he
moaned a ruined life  see it a
life of degradation and misery with an
evil man oh my god 

   mr bethune i said  dont take
it so hard if you wish to tell me any-
thing let me hear it perhaps i can
help you out

 ah perhaps you can let me
ask you sir are you a married man
no sir i answered with a laugh
  have not met the lady yet-that is
to know it

    am an old man my head is full
of fanciful ideas but you must excuse
me he said you would he better
married

  i laughed putting my hand in my
pocket i felt the ten-cent piece all i
possessed i was going to show it to
him hut he broke in

   i came to tell you a story mr wal-
lace-to ask your help your advice and
perhaps a sacrifice i am bewildered-
strangely bewildered but let me begin
you will see that there is enough at this
time almost to make me insane

  i filled and lit my pipe again and told
him to proceed

  mr wallace he began up to four
years ago i was a happy man living with
my son his wife and eunice their
daughter in a pretty home in missis-
sippi my son was named john and
my own name is william

  john became dissatisfied with con-
ditions there and having read of the
enormous profits in sheep-rasing here
he came out and purchased the ranch
upon which we live now of course you
see the land is of poor quality owing
to lack of water we had no money
and could not improve the natural con-
ditions my sons wife could not en-
dure the loneliness and soon pined
away after that my son was not the
same he took to drink and spent much
of his time in mackinville

  there he met companions that were

not good for him and at times they
would come out to the ranch and all
day sunday would drink and play cards
my son grew so bad that i was afraid
eunice would sicken and die she wept
so much

   then two years ago the awful
thing happened among the boon com-
panions my son had found at mackin-
ville was a mexican named de paro
frederick de paro was perhaps the
worst of the lot he was not a bad-
looking fellow but a dare-devil unscru-
pulous when it was necessary to get
somebody out of his way-in fact a
perfect scoundrel

   he was apparently rich and it was
said that he got his wealth by stealing
cattle at any rate it was known that
he was the chief of a gang of mexicans
that infested the border always making
trouble well one sunday they were
all out at the ranch six of them drink-
ing heavily and betting high my son
had already lost his little savings

   among the others was the sheriff
lie was a rough man but not a wicked
one but he traveled with a bad lot
and he too drank a great deal toward
night the game was almost a frenzied
one horses and cattle were wagered
on the cards and one man wagered his
farm and lost a week later he shot
himself

   my son john had lost all control of
himself but de paro never did that
lie was always cool and calculating and
never lost an opportunity that showed
itself

   i had sent eunice away to the front
of the house so that she would not hear
their coarse vile language i watched
them for i did not know what they
would do

     am out  i heard my son say c i
am busted

     youve got a ranch and plenty of
cattle said de paro

   you see mr wallace the ranch and
stock were all mine he could not bet
that

    well i heard de paro say to my
son  if you cant bet the place bet the
girl i like her she is pretty and i
want a wife any way bet the girl
ill put up a thousand dollars against
her
rile hoodoo ranch



   my son eagerly leaped at such an
offer because he was drunk

  c i protest  shouted it is uot
legal

   there was a loud insulting laugh
of course they did not care whether it
was legal or not

  it was a most exciting game and
my son lost

   oh god how my old heart throbs
now as i recall the scream that eunice
gave when john told her she had been
lost to de taro

   she fell on her knees and implored
him not to sacrifice her to such a man
but whisky had got the best of john
and he would not relent

   there was a brother of de paro in
the crowd he and john were always
having words the younger de paro
did not like john

   they had words that day and my
son drew his pistol and shot young de
paro dead

   at first there was consternation
but the coolness of the living de paro
was such that the others became calm
the sheriff was going to arrest john
but de paro stopped him

    wait he said   let me have a few
minutes speech with eunice

   at that moment there was a clatter
of hoofs and two horsemen rode up
they were united states officers and
they wanted de paro for a crime they
covered him with revolvers took him
away and when they saw the dead body
of his brother they asked who commit-
ted the murder the sheriff showed
his badge

    ive got him all right said he

    gentlemen i know what you want
me for said de paro  youve got the
drop on me and  will go but first i
want to talk to the girl who is to be my
wife just a moment

    hurry up said one of the officers

   de paro went in where eunice was
crying herself sick and tried to calm her
he said he would be kind to her he
said the marriage could not be at once
any way for two men were going to take
him on a long journey for awhile it
was for cattle-stealing on the indian
reservations

  e he called for a pen and some paper
and he wrote oh do you know what

he wrote he wrote to the effect that
she was to be his wife that her father
had killed his brother and that unless
she agreed to marry him the day he re-
turned he would shoot her father her
grandfather-thats myself-and carry
her off to mexico where he would keep
her so she could never escape

  vc the poor girl was in terror she
was white and trembling and the
thought of her father being hanged for
murder impelled her to do the bidding
of de paro she signed that paper
promising to become his wife on the day
he was liberated

  the old man stopped and a sob broke
from him i sat silent pondering upon
the question whether such a promise
was good for anything or not

   did your son die  

  that sir i do not know he got
worse and one day went to mackinville
and never came back we have not
given him up for dead

  the story had stirred me greatly i
knew the kind of man de paro must be
without soul or conscience and to pic-
ture pretty eunice bethune the slave of
such a one was revolting

   now mr bethune i said  tell me
just what you think i can do to help
you and eunice

   ah  my head is old and full of fan-
cies i did think something when i
saw how manly how honest you looked
and how strong but it would be too
great a sacrifice

   no sacrifice would be too great if by
it i could insure your happiness i
said

   what i thought in my old head
came the quavering voice  was if you
should take the right to protect eunice
i am old one day not far from now i
shall lie down and never wake
eunice then must light the world alone
which she could not do she is a good
girl educated and pretty she would
make a good wife i thought if you
should marry her before de paro came
he would be afraid of you when he
wouldnot of an old man like me

  i was stunned for a minute this
was certainly a strange request yet as i
looked upon the wild surroundings the
uncivilized setting in which the girl was
placed  could not wonder at it


the argosy

   mr bethune  am a poor man i
paid   have this ranch and just ten
cents to my name

   you have a big ranch at your age
it ought to make no difference whether
you have money or not eunice is a
hard worker w hen i die she will have
that ranch of a thousand acres y ours
is two thousand you will be rich
enough you two

  -	but i stammered  would eunice
consent 

   would she  consent to marry you 
when she knows that she must marry
de paro to-morrow if she does not
she will be worse off  shall be killed
but i care little for that my tirnc has
almost come but with you  know my
eunice would be safe

  if eunice wishes it to be so mr
bethune i will do it i said

  i had become so reckless that i was
ready for anything

  i saw some difficulty ahead but at
least the marriage would be legal it
would give me the right to protect the
girl if anything did happen to the old
man

  at my reply his eyes closed and a
bland smile of happiness came upon his
face he slowly rose to his feet he
held out a trembling hand to me and i
took it

   he tried to speak but his voice failed
he swayed with glad emotion or weak-
ness and i tried to help him into the
buckboard  heard him make a
peculiar noise

  i looked at him his eyes were star-
ing at me and he was evidently trying
to say something an ashen gray color
had spread over his face

   it will be all right mr bethune i
said

  i was alarmed at his condition

  he understood the poor worn-out
heart gave way and he sank back against
me-dead

chapter yin

i ittnt up the wrong man

  here was a predicament that i had
not bargained for i now had my work
cut out for me and no mistake it was
growing dark and eunicc was alone i
supposed they had men on the ranch the

same as i had but none to protect her at

 the house

 i wanted miguel then worse than i
 had wanted money in new orleans
 but miguel was nearly a mile away

 manuel was nearer  could reach
 him by making a detour to the west on
 my way to bethunes house but i
 could not take the old man very well
 on the buckboard for it was not a targe
 one and the idea was not pleasant

  carried him inside my house and
 placed him in my own bed then i
 caught my pony and leaping into the
 saddle galloped off

  found manuel and spoke to him at a
 distance

  manuel  i called

  si senor 

  take a man with you get miguel
 and go to the house mr bethune is
 there dead

 for a moment he stood and stared
 then with a wild rush he caught a horse
 and without saddle or bridle started on
 a wild career to the southward an-
 other of my pony herders followed and
  went on my way to bethunes eunice
 was standing in the door as i rode up
 and her face showed great anxiety

  mr wallace have you seen my
 grandfather she asked

 i dismounted before i replied

 yes miss bethune i said he
 came over to see me

 about-about-

  yes about to-morrow

  what did he say 

  sit down and i will tell you

 she sat down and looked at me in a
 way that seemed almost terror-stricken

 i repeated just what the old man had
 told me and she said it was all true

  now miss bethune he asked me to
 assume the right to protect you

  how can you 

  well his idea was for me to ask you
 to be my wife if you consented it
 would give me the right if you did
 not consent of course i could do noth-
 ing any more than any friend

 she shrank from me

  but  do not know you you do not
 know me

  i explained all that to mr bethune
 but he seemed to think it was the only
 way out
the hoodoo ranch



   and you  

  well as for me i am the gainer
since i get a wife i do not ask you
thinking that you wish to marry a man
you have seen only a few minutes and
never heard of before that would be
preposterous but our ranches are
close together you knew my uncle and
if you like you can get my record from
new york

    on the other hand there is de paro
and now you have no one but me to
rely on

  yes grandfather is old lie can-
not do much

   miss bethune when your grand-
father had my promise he attempted to
get into his buckboard but the ex-
citement was too great and he sank into
my arms dead

   oh  oh oh  she moaned placing
her hand against her heart alone
alone helpless and alone 

   you see now it becomes even more
necessary you cannot remain alone in
your house somebody must protect
you i do not wish to force myself upon
you miss bethune if you prefer not
to enter into the matter at all you must
tell me so i had not thought of such
a marriage perhaps i might in time to
come but until yom- grandfather asked
me pointblank i had no such thought
now think about it a moment take
time

  oh take me to grandfather she
sobbed

  i saw then where i had blundered
t had ridden my horse and left the buck-
board at my place

   can you manage with this saddle 
i asked her

   yes anything to get to poor grand-
father

   i assisted her she arranged her skirts
and we started we reached the adobe
house having had very little conversa-
tion on the way

  miguel and manuel stood before the
door

  this ver bad news senor said
miguel what happened

   why he came lo see me and became
somewhat excited and as he went to go
dropped dead

  it was no quarrel

   no nothing like that it was per-

haps more a sudden relief from tension
than anything else-a reaction

  miguel nodded but probably did not
understand

  eunice had rushed into the house and
i went slowly after her  heard her
sobbing and saw her down on her knees
kissing the dead mans hands

   grandfather if it was your wish
if you said so  will consent any-
thing dear grandfather lo be free from
de paro 

i went over and stood by her side
with my hand resting on her brown hair
finally she rose and looked at me

   mr wallace she said and her
voice did not tremble as much as it had
 i see nothing before me but darkness
if my grandfather trusted you i may
do so it seems a strange thing to do
but now i am all alone and this is not
the place to be left alone i could per-
haps sell the ranch and go elsewhere
but nowhere would i be free from de
paro  have no one to whom i could
go i must place my confidence in
you

   it shall not be misplaced i an-
swered  i swear it at your grand-
fathers side

  she began to weep again

  you must be calm i said  we
have much to think of in the first
place you must not go back to your
house to-night i am going to start for
maclcinville and will not be back till
some time to-morrow you see i can
trust my own men miguel and manuel
they could not go to your house and
protect you because they would have
no authority to keep any one out here
they have that authority even to shoot-
ing if i am absent so you remain here
to-night and they will take care of you

   if any one should come to see you
to-night they would go to your house
not finding you they might return to
maclcinville or wherever they came
from and not molest this place at all
dont you think it better for you to re-
main  

   i cannot think  she said i will
do whatever you advise

   that is settled then now miguel
you and manuel remain here to-night
and keep watch permit no one to see
miss bethune if any person i care
	 the argosy

not who tries to force his way in shoot
him at the door do you understand

senors  

    si senor

  once more mounting my pony 
dashed away

  it was with a strange tumult within
me that i rode to mackinville about ten
oclock that night the owner of a
big ranch on which three thousand
five hundred animals were slowly starv-
ing to death with ten cents of work-
ing capital  was going to be married
to-morrow

  i remembered as i rode into town that
jones had not kept his promise and had
not come out to see me about the papers
as he had agreed to do but they could
wait i wanted to see jaffry first
there was a light in the office and i
went to the door dismounting i
walked in jones sat writing

   how are you mr jones  

  he looked up and i thought a note of
surprise came into his face and at once
died away again

   hardly expected to see you he
said and -i fancied there was a tinge of
restraint in his voice

  where can i find mr jaffry
asked

   i am not sure but he may be over
at the hotel playing pool

   you did not get out to ray ranch
to-day

   no he said beginning to write
again   was busy

   maybe hes got a sore head because
i didnt offer him any money i said to
myself

  i walked over to the hotel and there
was jaffry with several others playing
pool a group stood watching the
game

   motioned to mr jaffry and fancied
a look of annoyance showed itself on
his face but he came to me

   mr jaffry tell-me something about
the marriage laws of arizona

   why they are about the same as
elsewhere he replied  the cere-
mony performed by a minister or a
justice of the peace is binding

   where is the nearest minister
i asked

  he looked at me curiously and as
though amused

   are you going to be married he
asked

   yes

   you are in somewhat of a hurry
dont you think-the second day you are
here  

   the circumstances make it neces-
sary i answered

   oh he said with a smile of sig-
nificance

   will you tell me where to find the
minister  

   why yes the rev mr slimpeke
he lives on mexico street near the
church

  where is that  

  he showed me and  went to see mr
slimpeke

  the minister took me into his little
room which was called by courtesy a
library

   sit down he said smugly but with
a tone of inquiry in his voice

  lie was the kind i never liked he
was too infernally good a religion in
which his selfish personality was the
central point stood out all over his every
feature

   mr slimpeke i said  i am about
to be married to-morrow it is rather
a sudden call my name is wallace i
live on the ranch that was my uncles
west of here

   ah yes um  who is the fortu-
nate young lady 

   miss eunice bethune on the next
ranch to mine

  bethune eunice bethune 
could not do that there must be
some mistake i have already received
a fee to marry miss bethune to-morrow
morning at ten oclock to a mr de
paro

   do you know you would be aiding
and abetting in a great crime if you did
that

  young man a minister of the gos-
pel judges his acts by the-

   money he receives i answered
 all right good-night

              there is one hope left i told my-
          self  the justice of the peace i
          wonder where he is

 to be conlinved
 dixons venetian dodge

by matthew white jr

an americans memorable night in venice when he took a desperate chance in a daring game

dixon stepped out on the little bal-
cony and gnashed his teeth as
his eye took in the beauty ol the scene
across the grand canal the church of
la salute stood out in all its transcen-
dant beauty revealed by the red fires
burning on its steps countless gondolas
threaded their way in and out of the
space between while over all the moon
looked down and across the waters came
the tinkle of mandolins accompanying
an italian baritone in the toreador
song from  carmen

  it was dixons first night in venice
an experience to which he had been
looking forward ever since february
when his passage had been taken and
here he was-alone

  it had been arranged that he was to
join the van brunts in austria he
and the girls had read up and thought
up and talked up this particular evening
all the trip across and while business
detained dixon in london he had kept
in frequent touch with them by letter
and post-card while they made the
grand tour and now mrs van brunt
had fallen ill in vienna the girls could
not leave her and so dixon found a
telegram in innsbruck to inform him
that they could not go into italy just
then

  and it was equally impossible for him
to wait lie was to sail back from cher-
bourg on the following sunday and as
his tour tickets had been bought there
was nothing for it but for him to go on
by himself 

  he was thinking ruefully of what
might have been and trying to decide
whether there would be an atom of
pleasure in taking a lonely gondola ride
when his attention was caught by a pet-
ulant exclamation in the room behind
him

   i think it was very inconsiderate of
the keelers to leave italy out at the
eleventh hour in this way here we are
cooped up on this glorious night because

we havent a man to go out with us no
mother ill just sit here and read it
only exasperates me to look at some-
thing when i cant be part of it

  dixon turned and saw a girl he had
noticed when they changed cars that
afternoon at verona she was a stun-
ning creature and he had not known
till now that she and her mother had
come to his hotel

  the mother had stepped out on the
other balcony and the girl had thrown
herself into a chair which she had
drawn up in such a way that it blocked
his return into the room

   i wonder if i dare

  schemes began to make a wild circuit
of dixons brain here they were a
man and a maid each from the far-away
home country each pining for compan-
ionship of the opposite sex and yet
placed as far apart as though the whole
atlantic rolled between by a mere law
of convention

   no that wont do he cogitated
 merely asking her to move her chair
a few inches so that i can pass will
scarcely constitute a sufficient excuse
for inviting her and her mother out in
a gondola no hugh dixon you must
play high or pass lhe trick

  he might pretend that he had met
her at some dance at home and forgot-
ten her name but this was terribly
risky when he didnt even know tho
city from which she hailed besides it
savored too strongly of the conlidence-
man trick as played on the rural visitor
to the metropolis

  meanwhile the precious minutes of
his few hours in venice were hitting
he must think of some device and at
once

  the old lady was absorbed in the gay
scene on the water the hotel itself ap-
peared to be deserted every one was
out on the grand canal dixon turned
and took one more look at the tempta-
tion with its back to him
the argosy



  what an entrancing curve of the
cheek that was and he was sure those
eyes now fixed so moodily on the three-
weeks-old tribune could dance with

                             

  suddenly he had an inspiration
where was it he had seen the name
keeler across the end of a dress suit-
case if he could only recollect that
the wav might be open

  ah he had it now it was on the sta-
tion platform at botzen where he had
stopped for lunch

   aleck he remembered now hear-
ing the woman say  you had better
keep vour eye on that man and she
had pointed to a traeyer who was walk-
ing ahead of them with the suit-case in
question

   its a mighty insecure peg  which
to hang an acquaintance dixon told
himself  but ill risk it so here goes

  pate helped him to the extent of his
being obliged to speak to the girl in any
case in order to leave the balcony

   i beg pardon he said keying his
voice to a pitch which he thought would
not reach  mothers  ears

  the young lady started nevertheless
as if a cannon had gone off behind her

   oh she exclaimed leaping to her
feet and turning around so as to face
dixon then with a relieved look as
she took in the unmistakable american
cut of his clothes  im in the way im
very sorry i didnt think

  she stood aside while dixon bent over
and moved the chair stepped into the
room drew a long breath and then
made his desperate plunge

   by the way i believe i met some
friends of yours this meaning

   you did she cried hr face
alight  who were they and -here dd
you meet them not here in yepiee
surely

  no it was back in austria at bot-
zen keeler was the name i think

  how perfectly jolly oh mother
mother here is some one who knows the
keelers and she stepped to the other
window and appeared the next instant
with the chaperon iu tow

  dixon came up to the scratch in tine
form

   my name is dixon hugh dixon
he said in his easy way   am from

new york and merely ran into the

keelers in passing

  yes said the old lady who was
surveying him through her lorgnette in
critical fashion  they were to have
met us here but sent a wire was it bad
news from home that caused them to
change their plans

   oh no answered dixon recklessly
you see at the last minute mrs
keeler conceived a terror of italy in the
hot weather

   mercy do you think there is any
danger burst out the old lady while
at the same instant dixon noted that
the daughters eyes first grew round in
amazement and then began to glint
with the fun-light that he had wanted
to see in them

  not in the least he declared
you see how delightful it is here or
at least it would be if we were out in the
moonlight on the grand canal allow
me to be your escort i think i can
secure a gondola

   oh mother it would be heavenly 
and dixon hew to the porter to make
arrangements fearing to linger lest the
old lady might put more embarrassing
questions regarding his acquaintance-
ship with the iveelers

  once aboard the gondola dixon as-
sured mamma that as daughter was
the lightest she must sit in the middle
with himself and mother on either hand
to trim ship and so the ecstatic evening
began

  dixon reeked not of the awful blun-
der he had made and wilfully shut his
eyes to the fact that he did not evtm
know the names of his companions
was he not floating about the grand
canal under the moon with music in
the air the stones of magnificent venice
rearing their impressive architecture
about him and a pretty girl who was
also clever by his side later when the
lights on the water began to thin out
they landed at the piazzetta and dixon
prevailed upon the ladies to take re-
freshments at florians while they lis-
tened to the band play in st marks
square

  it was while he was face to face with
 mamma  at the small round table
that dixons bad quarter of an hour
began
dixons venetian dodge



    it is most fortunate mr dixon
she said  that the keelers told you to
look us up you see we have only this
oue night in venice and i would not
cousen to come out without an escort
and p or ethel was most disconsolate
did miss lveeler find the ring she lost
in paris  

  the perspiration broke out on dix-
ons forehead and he wondered in alarm
what would come next

    who the mischief is miss keeler  
he asked himself

   but he knew that he who hesitates is
lost so he replied glibly

    no  not yet but detectives arc at
work on the case i believe with hopes
of success

   and what have they heard from
home lately  went on the old lady

   oh mr dixon im sorry ex-
claimed ethel

  her glass of water had overturned
and sent a stream trickling over the
table into his lap

  damages repaired  mamma  re-
turned to the charge this time from a
new quarter

    they tell us mr dixon she began
 that listeners never hear any good of
themselves but i should like to have
overheard the keelers description of
us which enabled you to identify us so
readily

   how absurd mamma broke in
ethel  dont you remember those
snap-shots on the ship  they were very
good indeed i am sure mr dixon must
needs be very dense indeed if he could
not readily locate us after a glimpse of
them

  dixon did not dare flash her the
grateful glance which was inspired by
her words

    she is either  on to me  he told
himself  or else all the gods in the
world of chance have camped on my
trail

  meantime  mamma  was rambling
on

  you know we met the keelers on
the basis of a blunder we were all
stopping at narragansett one summer
and our letters were continually getting
mixed

  you see ethel struck in while
keeler and riker dont sound much

alike they can be made to look so in
writing

dixon fell back in his chair could

it be possible

  are you ethel riker he gasped
in astonishment

yes to be sure i am and whv

not  	j

   and you knew the gliddens at
narragansett 

    they are our best friends declared
mrs riker

    then ive carried a letter of intro-
duction to you all over europe what
an idiot ive been 

  how remarkable exclaimed the
chaperon  i should have thought that
the letter would have occurred to you
when the keelers told you to look us
up

    yes added ethel wickedly as dix-
on fished the letter in question out of
his pocket and handed it over to her
mother mrs keeler might better
have been talking about the gliddens
than telling you about the detectives
she engaged to hunt the ring that
she wrote me her brother found the
very next day i forgot to tell mamma
of it

   ethel had lowered her voice and was
leaning across the table toward him
while her mother was absorbed in the
letter from mrs glidden

    i believe you were  on  from the
first whispered dixon

    you mustnt talk slang in poetical
venice the other admonished him
 did you say you werent leaving until
to-morrow afternoon  

    yes but well have plenty of time
to do the doges palace together  -
eagerly

  i hope so you certainly should
make a pilgrimage across the bridge of
sighs to groan over your sins of this
evening

    but isnt it better to lie a little as
blanche bates used to tell us in the
darling of the gods than to be un-
happy much besides maybe i made
two people happy he added auda-
ciously

   i wonder rejoined ethel with the
glint of mischief again in her eye
 shall we not ask my mother to tell
us

a conspiracy against a wall street manipulator which found itself astray and wrought fear

and frenzy aboard an ocean liner

synopsis of chapters previously published

     the yacht babbler belonging to brandon burgess the wealthy wall street speculator lies across the
pier from the steamer yantic both are ocean bound burgess and his secretary horace tarr are to
take a mediterranean cruise two trunks both marked h t in a diamond are brought to the pier ad-
dressed to the yantic and the babbler respectively one is stenciled in red and one in black

     the watchmans dog excited by the constant ticking in one of the trunks worries off their tags which
the watchman replaces in reverse order

     helen trainor her invalid brother calvin and her aunt are to sail on the yantic burgess who is in
love with helen decides to send tarr on their steamer in case that he may be of service tarr suggests
his destitute cousin ben crowding as valet for trainor crowding has been employed in burgess
milk which are shut down and he is very bitter against him tarr has met his cousin in suspicious places
and notices that he seems ill at ease in burgess presence

     while befriending a little italian boy angelo tarrs attention is called to an old woman in the steerage
who bears a striking resemblance to brown one of crowdings suspicious associates through angelo the
old woman tries to discover tarrs identity

     miss trainor finds the wrong trunk has been sent to her stateroom and asks to have the right one
stenciled with a black h t in a diamond sent up from the baggage-room angelo searches for the trunks
and reports only a red label of the same style ho says something was moving in the trunk

     on his way back from the baggage-hunt tarr overhears the conversation of some passengers by a
marconigram they have learned that burgess stocks are rapidly falling and that he has left the city
pondering this he notices angelo thrust a note into crowdings hand crowding reads it and faints in
attending to him tarr discovers a goad concealed in crowdings clothes preventing him from lying down
or even resting in the stateroom crowding seems terrified and he obviously has some terrible secret
that is preying upon his mind but which he refuses to divulge

    up on deck tarr finds miss trainor with the broker kinney one of burgess rivals an un-
pleasant remark is passed between the men later kinney insults tarr who boxes his ears the rumor
is circulated that the quarrel occurred about helen trainor and that tarr has been sent to watch her by
burgess

     tarr receives word that crowding has become delirious and after an interview with the old woman
in the steerage has tried to break into the baggage hold going to his stateroom he finds crowding
raving about something which he must stop and shrieking over and over again  only a hundred hours

chapter xiv

an unanswered problem

day broke at last-a blowy misty
dirty morning a morning when
it looked all along the sea-line as though
the slatternly wind-sprites had hung all
their dirty rags of cloud out to air and
the sea was sullen

wave after wave rose out of the
northeast to meet the proud prow of the
yantic slapped her sullenly and with no
little spitefulness on either jowl and
parted for her passage running hissing
aft as though angry that they could not
stop her progress

horace tarr viewed the unsightly

 prospect from the door of his stateroom
 as soon as the gray light of dawn shim-
 mered on the apparently flat surface of
 the sea the air was raw the smell
 of fog was still dank in his nostrils
 the night which had just passed had
 been no time of rest or calm for him

   crowding had finally sunk into a stu-
 por and his babblings had ceased for
 the time but the broken sentences
 rankled in tarrs mind-gave him no
 peace-gripped his thought and would
 not set it free again

  what was the mystery which had
 driven poor crowding into his present
 state of mind what did those broken
 words mean
downing the king-pin

   there was a deep and sinister signifi-
 cance tarr was certain to every sen-
 tence the sick man uttered

   in the calm of the morning after re-
 viewing each particular phrase the sick
 man had used it seemed rather improb-
 able that his mention of the  red dia-
 mond  had aught to do with either
 tarrs trunk which he had sent down
 to the babbler the night before he sailed
 on the yantic or with the trunk that
 trimble had found in the hold marked
 in the same way and with the same ini-
 tials

  and while he stood there watching
the changing sea the figure of little
angelo appeared before him

    signor is the other signor better
 this morning he asked in his soft
 voice

  tarr looked down upon him rather
blankly for a moment

   io you mean crowding-mr
trainors man  

    si signor

    he is no worse  but he is very ill
 he does not know me and he is likely
 to be ill a long time

    it is bad signor said the boy with
 his ingratiating smile and would have
 withdrawn had not tarr stayed him
 with a beckoning forefinger

    who sent you to inquire angelo
he asked

    she sent me

   the-the old woman below 

  the boy nodded and would have
again departed but tarr had another
question

    see here my son he said drawing
 some silver from his pocket  you
 earned half a dollar yesterday by telling
 me something now here is another
 and he held it up

   the boys black eyes snapped and he
 waited in silence for what was to fol-
 low

  you went into the hold with mr
trimble to look for that trunk yester-
day forenoon tarr observed watching
the boy closely

   the change that came inlo the little
 fellows face at this was quite startling
 he paled and drew farther away from
 the secretary

   dont be afraid tarr said sooth-
ingly  i saw you go down there you

      	a



found a trunk marked in red with two
letters-h and t-inside a diamond
figure likewise marked iu red you re-
member  

  the boy evidently remembered
there could be no doubt of that but
why being reminded of that trunk
should so trouble him was quite mysti-
fying

     whats the matter the secretary
demanded   ou were telling something
about that trunk to the old woman be-
low--

  no no signor gasped the boy
still drawing away  i sav noting
eet is not so

     come heres half a dollar for you
repeat to me what you said-

  but before he could say more the
boy turned and darted away and was
quickly out of sight

    hang it  muttered tarr  thats
messerodcs fault he threatened to
beat the boy if he repeated it what
was it-something about a noise in the
trunk a clock ticking what an asi-
nine thing it is for me to pay any at-
tention to such foolishness

   what could it possibly be the
boy imagined something or he is a nat-
ural born liar as messerode intimated
i-im a fool 

   he tried to drive away all thought of
the trunk and when the steward c-ame
up ordered an early breakfast sent to
his cabin crowding was still asleep
when dr meachem appeared

   youd better get some rest your-
self the surgeon advised  go down
into my cabin-youll find it quiet
there

  but tarr would not leave the room
he lay down on the extra berth how-
ever and slept soundly for an hour
while the doctor watched the patient

   tarr was awakened by the thin voice
of crowding babbling his incessant
phrases about the red diamond and a
hundred hours and all the rest of it

    i feel a hundred per cent better
the secretary declared when the surgeon
would have urged him to retire for
proper rest

   indeed he felt anxious to have no-
body listen to crowdings delirious
words he was convinced that there
was some sinister meaning to them


the argosy

  when the doctor departed ho sat
down beside the sick man and listened
again and yet again to the familiar
phrases by and by lie seized a pencil
and paper and began to jot them down

  crowding seemed to go through the
same formula of words ending with
that terrified cry about  a floating
hell  and then began all over again
part of it he muttered too low for tarr
to catch the words but it was not
always the same phrases that were miss-
is

  by writing down all he said the sec-
retary saw a chance of finally obtaining
a pretty connected expression of what
was on the sick mans mind

  in some book he had read a secret
had been discovered in this manner
the words crowding uttered he was
sure were the same each time and they
were not many

  when the poor fellows mind had
given way his trouble had expressed
itself in these thoughts and now that
he was delirious these same thoughts
recurred to his weakened mind again
and again finding expression over and
over in the same phraseology

  each time the poor fellow reached
the climax of his reflections his agony
became more intense after one of
these paroxysms when he began to
speak again tarr with his ear held
close to enable him to distinguish the
faintest sounds wrote down the words
as he heard them

   the red diamond    i must stop
it-i must stop it    these inno-
cent people-god help them    set
for one hundred hours    one hun-
dred hours and then-hell    
the last of the words were too in-
distinct that time for him to get but
the sick man writhed on his couch and
beat his hands feebly in despair then
he began again and the first words tarr
distinguished were different

  i must open-    only one

hundred hours what a wretch-

these innocent people-god help them 

	  happy untroubled secure   
half has passed    hell-a float-
ing hell 

  once more the muttering began

   i must stop it i must stop it

	  what a wretch  am my punish-

ment is too great    they little know
-unconscious of peril    it was set

for one hundred-    

  and on and on the poor fellow bab-
bled his misery while tarr the sweat
standing on his brow jotted down the
broken phrases until he like crowding
himself had learned them by heart

 and what did he make of them
after the sick man had worried himself
into exhaustion tarr set himself the
task of dove-tailing the words together
into their logical sequence

 the red diamond i must

open- i must stop it i must

stop it only one hundred hours
what a wretch i am my punishment
is too great these innocent people-
god help them they little know-
unconscious of peril happy un-
troubled secure it was set for one
hundred hours half has passed one
hundred hours and then-hell a float-
ing hell 

  tarr read this striving to understand
the mystery to which the words referred
lie knew he had not gathered every
word of crowdings delirious mutter-
ings he had been unable to learn what
it was the man felt that he must
 open

  and the reference to the  innocent
peoplewho were  unconscious of
peril m was quite as blind crowding
had done or thought he had done some
dreadful thing which had imperiled
others had it been something which
had occurred before tarr met him in
new york 

   perhaps the story he gave me about
losing his job and being half-starved
and penniless because of the shutting
down of the mill was not entirely true
he may have done something-broken
the law in some way - and run away
from his home

    but surely there is some foundation
lor his agony there must be some
fire where there is so much smoke
the reference to the one bund rr cl
hours puzzled tarr quite as much as
anything else what had crowding
set for one hundred hours and
what did he mean by  a floating hell 

  surely that last must refer to some
craft something may have been done
on a boat what boat could it be
downing the king-pn



that some peril threatened the yantic
why that seemed impossible what
could crowding know about this steam-
ship he probably had never heard of
the vessel until tarr had told him of his
chance to serve calvin trainor as nurse

   yet that follow brown-or what-
ever his name is-is aboard this ship
and crowding knows him it was di-
rectly after an interview with brown
that he went off his head entirely mut-
tered the secretary

   is there some plot against the peace
and lives of the passengers on this ship
but that is preposterous if it were so
surely brown and crowding if they
knew of it would not have risked their
own lives by corning aboard her no
no that cant be it and who can
i take into my confidence i cannot he
a traitor to my own cousin-not to ben
crowding with whom i played and stud-
ied years ago-even if he is mixed up in
a criminal conspiracy

   until i have proof that he has really
committed a crime i am not called upon
to sacrifice him and perhaps not then
my mind is not at all secure on that
point

  he rose and began to pace the con-
fines of the stateroom the situation
presented an unsolvable enigma

charter xv

news of ttte babbler

  a gentle rap at the door startled
tarr as though it had been a much more
commanding summons it was now mid-
forenoon and the deck was well peopled
with first-class passengers despite the
unfriendly aspect of the weather when
he opened the door his amazement was
in no way decreased by the presence of
helen trainor awaiting his pleasure

  for a moment tarr was quite speech-
less

   good-morning she said quietly
and without her usual smile  i undcr-
-tand you have been watching with your
cousin all night mr tarr we shall
have you ill next you must allow us

lo	assist you

   really-really stammered tarr
 i dont know what you can do-

 i can sit beside him while you go

somewhere and lie down she said
quickly

  hut miss trainor i do not think i
ought to allow it lie is quite de-
lirious

ir meachem tells me he is far too
weak to try to get out of his berth now

	poor fellow  what a terrible thing it
is how little we know what far-
reaching results may be entailed by our
actions

   what do you mean   he asked won-
deringly

   i presume you realize that as the
doctor says this condition of affairs has
been brought on by mental worry
poor crowding being driven from home
and from those-from her whom he
loved by the shutting down of his work
has now come to this pass it is terri-
ble-

  tarr saw that she and probably her
brother blamed it all upon brandon
burgess and his corner in cotton but
tarr was not minded to oppose her
statement now

  indeed he was rather glad that she
looked upon crowdings illness from
this standpoint

  t she will not suspect anything if he
babbles this stuff to her he ihought
aloud he said  it is not right to tax
you with my cousins care miss
trainor

   but if i wish to do this 

   then i surely will not refuse you
and i thank you heartily for your kind
thought ferhaps i will be better for
to-nights watch if i sleep some during
the daytime

  she was looking at him with unwaver-
ing eyes as lie spoke and although she
flushed a little her reply was uttered in a
firm tone

   do not mistake me mr tarr if i
am land it is for the sake of the poor
man who is ill you certainly do not
look for any favor at my hands sir
the words were biting and tarr fell
back before her as she entered the state-
room he knew to what she referred

  as calvin had told him and as he had
seen the evening before by her manner
helen held him accountable for the un-
pleasant position in which she had been
placed by the gossip having its birth at
the quoit game
the akgosy

  so she believed that he had allowed
her name to be brought into a low row
on the public deck of this steamer  tarr
withdrew without further words he
was too hurt to seek to defend himself
or to deny what she believed true he
avoided calvin when he went out upon
deck although he saw him in the dis-
tance attended by the ex-waiter ji
was a fact that  more than he was
troubled by the mystery of crowdings
illness tarr was disturbed over this
misunderstanding with helen rl rainor
and her brother and aunt

  and as his mind dwelt upon the fact
it was not for calvins mistrust in him
that he mourned he thought first of
helens attitude

  lr meachem had evidently been 
the lookout for him and kindly insisted
that tarr go below to his the doctors
cabin and lie down but despite his
wakeful night the secretary could not
sleep for long

  h-is many worriments were with him
in his dreams burgess and the bab-
bler kinney and helen trainor
crowding and the disguised brown
passed through his visions in continuous
procession

  and finally the luncheon bugle
awoke him as though it were the
signal of some threatening disaster
which had troubled the latter part of
his dream

  finding it impossible to sleep again
he arose had a bite of luncheon him-
self learned that the doctor had re-
lieved miss trainor as nurse and felt
able to go into the steerage before
returning to his own cabin

  as he drew near the strains of a fid-
dle and an accordeon and the shuffle of
feet announced the fact that the steer-
age passengers were having an after-
noon dance although there were few
young people among them aside from
the small children the returning emi-
grants mustered a goodly company on
the cleared space of the deck which
answered for the floor of the ball-room

  the couples were gravely moving
about in time to the rather rasping
sounds of the two instruments tarr
wended his way between them paying
no attention to either the dancers or the
audience of first and second cabin pas-

sengers that had gathered he had
spied the figure of the disguised brown
in an out-of-the-way corner and ap-
proached him directly

  he did not startle the supposed old
woman this time for his coming was
observed

   i have a word to say to you in pri-
vate he said in a low voice looking
intently down upon the shawl-shrouded
fic-ure  do you wrant to see me
here 

  the supposed old woman showed no
sign of understanding him her face
retained an expression of perfect blank-
ness and she shook her head with en-
ergy

    no no signor  she whined

  come come exclaimed tarr
 dont play the fool with me i know
you and unless you want me to go to
the officer of the ship and tell who you
are-

   i no spek inglese whined the
creature again vigorously shaking her
head

  one of the men who had been danc-
ing came over to them mopping his
flushed face with a yellow bandanna and
smiling broadly

    she no understand you sir he said
showing his white teeth in a broad
smile  she only speak-a da italian

  by jove muttered tarr she
writes english all right 

  no no how can that be cricd
her fellow-countryman  she no spek
eet how can she write eet 

   i no spek inglese declared the
supposed old woman for the second
time

  her face was swathed in a bandage
and she put her hand to it now and
began to moan rocking her body to and
fro

   she haf one bad tooth-eli  said
the man commiseratingly yet still smil-
ing brilliantly what you want wit
her signor  

  tarr saw that unless he was ready to
make a row right then and there there
was no use in following his intention
further

  the creature wouldut speak or give
him any satisfaction

  besides so much did she seem the
character she appeared that the secre-
downing the king-pin



tary was puzzled and began to grow
doubtful again

  suppose be had made a mistake
suppose it was not brown after all
many old women have a down on their
upper lip as heavy as that which shaded
the mouth of this person lie would
have given a good deal to remove the
bandage from about her face he be-
lieved that it hid from view cheeks
which would show plainly the need of
shaving

  he had to beat an inglorious retreat
and on his way to his own stateroom
to relieve dr meachem mr brier found
and halted him

   mr tarr captain holds wishes to
see you he is on the bridge hows
your friend no better sorry to
hear it

  the secretary of the millionaire cot-
ton king hastened to find the com-
mander of the yantic the captain was
pacing the deck with a slip of paper in
his hand

   youre mr horace tarr   he asked
in his gruff way

   i am what can i do for you 
asked the young man

   not a thing sir-not a thing
snapped captain holds you can
answer a question however sir

 tarr waited in doubt captain
holds did not seem in a very pleasant
mood

   i want to know sir if you know
anything about this -and ho held the
slip of paper toward tarr  what is
this yacht chasing us for i tell you i
dont care to have my steamer chased
as though she was a stray pup what
does it mean

  tarr in vast amazement read the
typewritten lines on the paper

  yacht babbler new york burgess
owner midriff master spoke us this
forenoon fifty miles eastward asking for
yantic anxious to speak

   wha-what does it mean gasped
tarr

   thats what i want to know sir-
thats what i want to know growled
captain holds  you are employed by
this burgess they tell me ho you
know anything about it  

   how should i know  

   dont dodge my questionsconfound
you  snapped the captain

   and dont you address me in that
manner i dont like it declared tarr
angrily  i had heard that the bab-
bler left new york night before last

y	our own wireless telegraph operator
got the news from some shore station i
believe

   i had no idea that the vacht was
following us i dont know what mr
burgess wants with you im sure i
dont know what he wants of me-

   well sir when a man chases a
steamship which numbers atuong its
passengers one of his trusted employees
he doesnt usually do it for pure enjoy-
ment sneered holds

   what do you mean by that sir
flashed out tarr

   i judge sir that you catch my
meaning said the captain of the ytan-
tic boring him with a suspicious glance
 there is something very strange about
this-very strange indeed

   your insinuating tone implies an
insult that i will not bear sir cried
tarr  explain yourself

   you declare you know nothing
about this message

   i dont even understand how you
could have got such a telegram-

   we passed the savoird of the
merchants and importers line an hour
ago she communicated by wireless
with us the yacht spoke her as you
can see this forenoon it must have
passed us and is now somewhere ahead
looking for us i want to know what it
means 

   well dont ask me i cant tell
you declared tarr

     seems very suspicious to me mr
tarr said the captain

    and your remarks seem very impu-
dent to me cried the passenger and
turning on his heel without further
words he left the bridge

  he was quite enraged at the english-
man but nevertheless the message as-
tounded him he was completely dazed
by it

  what did it mean the babbler
should be far on her course to the
mediterranean if burgess had really
started on nis vacation why should


the aeg os y

lie yacht he in this part of the north
atlantic

  and hunting for the yantic v by
it seeincil preposterous

  what should possess brandon bur-
gess to start out of the port of new
york on such a fool mission as this
searching the highways of the sea for a
particular steamship seemed a good deal
like looking for the proverbial needle in
a havstaek

  what was the matter with him  had
burgess too gone mad j if there had
been a raid made upon the cotton mar-
ket he should not have left new york
at all and to be wav of here--

  its nonsense sheer nonsense  he
muttered as he hurried to his stateroom

  yet looking down he saw the paper
in his hand and again read the type-
written lines that made it look very
real

  but it did not explain the mystery

chapter xvi

the treasure chamber

  it was plain that dr meachem was
greatly worried over crowdings condi-
tion despite the fact that the steam-
ship physician was a most self-opinion-
ated man he was devoted to his profes-
sion and the chance of losing a patient
worried him

   the fellow is badly off i admit
mr tarr he declared to horace
when the latter appeared in the sick-
room again  i have changed his med-
icine the treatment of disease is for
the most part a groping in the dark bv
even the best - trained physician we
know what remedies will act upon cer-
tain diseased organs but they will not
act the same with every person  can-
not seem to allay this mans fever jt
is terrific he grows weaker

   these delirious paroxysms are be-
coming more infrequent-

  and isnt that a good sign asked
tarr wondering if the doctor had made
anything out of crowdings wandering
speech

    it is not-assuredly not you hear
him gabbling a lot of stuff here now
and then between the times of this
speech yon suppose he is calmer 

   of course declared tarr

   no no youare wrong there is
something of extreme moment on that
mans mind it was on his mind as we
know when be was iaken with the first
mad paroxysm down below he repeats
over and over again wliat was making
that strong impression upon his brain
at the moment he collapsed do you
follow me  

  tarr nodded nobody knew better
than he that poor crowding was repeat-
ing again and again that mysterious
combination of phrases

   well sir he continually goes over
these same words at times he is
strong enough to repeat them aloud
but when he apparently sleeps or sinks
into exhaustion his state at this pres-
ent moment his troubled brain is still
engaged with these same thoughts
over and over again time after time
into the many thousands the man has
repeated these sentences since yesterday
afternoon

   he is repeating them even when he
is silent 

   automatically his thoughts repeat
them there see his lips move as
though he whispered in his sleep he
lies like a dead man otherwise dye see
like some machine geared to a system
of perpetual motion his mind contin-
ually repeats this thing that troubles
him

   and until  can assuage this menial
disturbance how can i get the best of
his fever can you tell me that mr
tarr   demanded the worried physi-
cian

 good heavens how can i tell
you   gasped the secretary

   the moment will come when the
mans brain will be sufficiently clear to
understand what is said to him if one
knew what had so disturbed his mind
at that-well call it occult moment he
might be assured that the cause of his
worriment was removed then i
would have a better chance to bring
him out of this condition

   but-but we dont know whats the
matter with him gasped tarr

  ah thats it said dr meachem
slowly wagging his head thats it
and what it is we may not be able to find
out you should le better able to guess
that than anybody sir
downing the king-pin



   i wish to god i did know  cried
tarr fervently

  the physicians remarks put him
quite in u fever of worriment when
he was left alone with the sick man and
the latter began babbling again tarr
drew forth the paper on which he had
transcribed the sentences which were
the burden of crowdings delirium and
studied them once more

  the red diamond  must

open- now what could that

mean what of the red diamond and
what was it the delirious crowding felt
that he must open

  when he had suffered his collapse the
previous afternoon crowding had been
fighting like a madman to enter the hold
forward through the hatchway in the
orlop deck trimble had reported that
the man tore tooth and nail at the
hatch fastenings

  was that what he had felt he must
open  and why 

   or had the association of ideas in his
poor weakened mind made him do this
tarr could not see how any danger
known to crowding could menace the
yantic it must be some other vessel
which was referred to in the mans de-
lirium as a floating hell

   crazed as he was muttered the
secretary  he would not be likely to
distinguish between this boat and the
one which troubles his mind if he
knows of some accident which has be-
fahen or is about to befall another shin
in his sudden insanity he might try to do
aboard this ship what he would do
aboard that other were he there
something has happened or is about to
happen in the hold of another vessel
crowding is criminally aware of what
it is his conscience as he told me
himself yesterday morning and as his
previous actions prove was lashing him
terribly

   he has done something or has
knowledge of the doing of something
which endangers the lives of innocent
people when he went entirely off his
head he strove to get into that hold be-
cause he thought that was the place
where this awful thing would occur

  gad what a mess it isnt pos-
sible that any danger threatens vs
that fellow brown-if it is brown-is

mixed up in it hed never risk his
neck on u vessel that was likely to be
injured-blown up or scuttled or any-
thing like that

  tarr paccd the confines of his cabin
in a terribly disturbed state while he
thus soliloquized and the thought of
brown set his mind ofe on another
track

  could it be possible that he had been
mistaken in that individual below in the
steerage if not the man was a con-
summate actor

  it might be a woman after all-an
old woman of browns own nationality
and who looked like him

   et he swore to himself crowding
had recognized the person too crowd-
ing had denied all knowledge of the
identity of the old woman yet angelo
said he had been the means of commu-
nication between them and tarr had
seen the boy pass the paper to crowd-
ing

  confound it somebodys lying
messercdc said the boy is a liar
crowding told me he had not received
any note and knew nothing about it
the boy acts strangely it is true-he
acted strangely this morning when i
spoke about that trunk yet what
object can he have in mystifying me 

  and with these and similar thoughts
he worried his mind for several hours
lie did not forget to attend to crowd-
ings every want however and fol-
lowed the physicians instructions im-
plicitly

  the forenoon passed and several pas-
sengers came to the door to inquire
about the sick man

  thai part of the deck was avoided by
the passengers in general who realized
that the doctor desired quiet for poor
crowding

  toward mid-afternoon two visitors
came whom tarr was not anxious to see

-	helen and her aunt the strained
relations which had existed for the last
twenty-four hours between the train-
ers and himself made any conversation
extremely awkward

  mrs shackelford showed this awk-
wardness more than helen for ihe
latter was anxious regarding crowding
and put every other thought aside but
that of mercy


the argosy

  you must let m relieve you for
awhile mr tarr she said while mrs
shackelford looked coldly on in the at-
titude of a person bent upon upholding
the proprieties but with interest neither
in the sick man nor his nurse

    it is good of you but you have your

own trouble with calvin-

  c this messerode is vcrv efficient
we have decided to take him with us
to berlin declared helen  he is well
recommended-

  and poor crowding wasnt i sup-
pose she means thought tarr  well
its an unfortunate mess i reckon bur-
gess would be sorry lie sent me on the
yantic if he knew how objectionable i
had become to helen trainor

  this swung his thoughts pendulum-
wise to burgess and the babbler and
as he left liis cabin to pace the deck
for a breath of air the strange message
received from the passing savoird puz-
zled his mird again

  whv had burgess changed the direc-
tion of his intended voyage across the
atlantic why was he hunting for the
yantic

  the cotton king had been greatly dis-
turbed by nervous apprehension as re-
garded helens trip across but tarr had
attributed this nervousness on his
employers part to overwork for
six months burgess had carried a re-
sponsibility that was bound to tell upon
any man

  he had engineered a financial scheme
such as the street had never seen
before and he had done it practically
alone there was little wonder that
burgess mind was easily disturbed

  but after sending his secretary on the
steamship with the girl whom he so
much admired burgess should have
been ratisfied this chasing the yantic
about the ocean was an utterly ridicu-
lous thing

  yet so much had occurred within the
last few hours to puzzle horace tarr
that the message from the savoird dis-
turbed him greatly and it had evi-
dently bothered captain holds likewise

  tea is usually served in the after-
noon aboard the ships of the blue cres-
cent line and having paid little
attention to his meals of late tarr was
hungry and went below as he came

down the companionway to the main

deck he noticed a sailor in uniform and
with a short cutlass strapped to his side
standing upright before a heavy -teel
door which was built into the bulkhead

  it was a place where the officers and
other members of the crew were passing
and repassing all the time both day and
night and tarr knew he had never seen
this sentinel here before observing
mr trimble the junior officer passing
he asked him what it meant

   why im sure sir i couldnt tell
you trimble declared  that is the
strong room-you knew that didnt
you 

   the strong room   repeated tarr
much puzzled

  yes sir the treasure vault

   where the passengers put their dia-
monds for safe keeping  asked the sec-
retary smiling

   oh no sir those go into the pur-
sers safe but that is literally a treas-
ure vault sometimes there isnt much
in it but at others the old spanish
treasure ships which morgan and his
ilk captured didnt have in their cargoes
the worth in gold and silver that is
locked into that vault

   you surprise me 

  most people would be surprised if
they came to think of it you read a
line in the newspaper that such and such
an amount of gold was exported by a
certain ship to europe one doesnt
realize what it means the captain is
held personally responsible for what is
in that place lie alone has the com-
bination which opens it

   and how much do you suppose is
in there now asked tarr mildly cu-
rious

  why i heard before we sailed that
they expected to put twenty millions in
gold behind that door

  twenty millions gasped tarr
amazed

   sh  trimble warned him seeing
brier passing and watching them
closely  so i heard i dont know
what the captain has suddenly put a
guard there for ho has his reasons i
expect were not supposed to speak
of the room or its contents to the pas-
sengers sir you will excuse me
now  
downing the king-pin



  something in the pursers looks had
seemed to trouble the junior officer and
he hastened to break away from tarr
the latter went on to the table how-
ever without attaching any particular
meaning to this

  his mind reverted again to the twenty
millions in gold however and whose
would not

chapter xvii

under the ban

  for the first time since the little
scene at the quoit game tarr came face
to face with kinney he sat down at
a table just opposite him kinney re-
turned tarrs look with an offensive
stare then he whispered something to
a man beside him and he likewise lifted
his head and looked sharply at the new-
comer

  but the secretary had made up his
mind to get into no further trouble with
lodowicks man

  had he noticed the company before
sitting down tarr would certainly have
selected another table but it would look
childish to change his seat now and he
paid strict attention to the viands which
the steward brought him

  but this did not satisfy kinney he
was one of that breed of curs which
are never contented to ignore one whom
they dislike he must needs snap and
snarl at his heels

  and possibly having the fear of tarrs
strong hand before his eyes the broker
cast about for other means of tantaliz-
ing his enemy than by personally ad-
dressing him the men about him
were gentlemen he dared not speak of
helen trainor

  therefore he set upon the one other
subject that was bound to  get a rise 
out of the secretary he did not glance
at tarr while he talked but he raised
his voice so that the young man would
be sure to hear every word

   as you were saving he remarked
to his next neighbor  the crash is going
to be a  beaut the fellow wont have
enough left to pay his laundry check
call him the  cotton king-huh hes
the cotton fool i reckon

   tarr did not raise his eyes but a little
silence fell upon the men near at hand

all realized that the broker was baiting

his vis-a-vis

   and the rascal deserves all hes
going to get hes a mucker any way
w ho ever heard of him before he struck
new york god knows how he came
by the money he started with hes
about the smoothest proposition that

ever broke into the market-

  tarrs spoon dropped into his saucer
with a sharp crash-a sound that
startled even kinney himself the sec-
retary half rose from his chair and
leaned across the board

  sir he exclaimed in a low but clear
voice  you are speaking of a man whom
 count as my friend as well as my em-
ployer i see plainly that you are
talking with the hope of creating a dis-
turbance again and i presume you
intend lying about the cause of our dif-
ference of opinion as you did before

   but let me warn you sir and i take
these gentlemen to bear me witness
that i shall consider any slurring refer-
ence to mr burgess from you a personal

insult and-

  he had leaned farther over rhe table
as he spoke his eyes blazing and his face
deadly white kinneys smile rather
lost its freshness as he observed these
indications of passion he had in-
tended to annoy his enemy but he did
not seek a personal encounter with him

  at this instant however a heavy
hand was laid upon tarrs shoulder and
he was jerked back into his chair the
effect of this upon the young man was
to set him in a violent rage wrenching
himself free he rose to confront ibis
new antagonist

  mr brier he exclaimed seeing
that burly officer at his elbow

   now look here mr tarr ex-
claimed the purser firmly well have
no more of this this is our public
dining-room you cant pick a quar-
rel here-nor anywhere else on this
boat you should be ashamed sir
 ashamed   gasped tarr

  now now pursued the purser
 dont have any words over it youre
a gentleman i hope

  	was maddening but what could
tarr do or say the word of the offi-
cer of a ship is a law that no sensible
passenger will disobey


the argosy

  it was evident that the garbled ac-
count of his former trouble with kinney
had reached the ears of the powers that
be and brier seeing the two men to-
gether again had seized upon rlarr as
the aggressor the latter would not
belittle himself by explaining

  he left his luncheon and without a
word to either brier or the others about
the table hurried out upon the open
deck

  there he paced to and fro the length
of the promenade along one rail boiling
with rage and wishing with all his heart
that he had never stepped foot upon the
yantic

  and yet how he had been secretly de-
lighted when burgess insisted upon his
accompanying the trainor party across
the atlantic

  and why not because he needed a
vacation he would have been much
more comfortable on the babbler the
yacht was a floating palace

  tarrs eves were being broadly opened
to his interest in helen trainor the
fact that to his mind it savored of dis-
loyalty to brandon burgess made no
difference to the truth tarr had looked
forward to the companionship of helen 
that was the chief pleasure he would
have taken in the voyage under other
circumstances

  but whether he had been disloyal in
thought and intention or no the fact re-
mained that his association with helen
trainor was not fruitful of much pleas-
ure he really shrank now from going
back to his cabin and relieving her in
her care of the sick man her coldness
was hard to face especially when he
knew he was undeserving of it he
awoke to the fact after a time however
that for some reason he was attracting
a deal of attention while pursuing his
lonely promenade

  most of the passengers were on the
shady side of the deckhouse but two of
the junior officers-one forward the
other aft-watched him at every turn

  at first he thought this imaginary on
his part but when he went into the
smoking-room for a drink one of these
young men followed him going out
through the opposite door and passing
around the other alley into the hows
he found the second man on his trail

   confound them all tarr mut-
tered  do they think im looking to
pick a fuss with kinney or what is it

i seem to be under a ban

  this surveillance made him nervous
and it seemed to him that every person
he passed looked upon him askance he
could swear that more than one prome-
nading couple glanced at him and whis-
pered together

  this became so unpleasant at last that
he was fairly driven back to his own
quarters mrs shackelford was evi-
dently glad to see him come and rose to
leave the cabin at once crowding was
muttering and crying out again and
helen was bending over him bathing
his face and moistening his parched and
fever-cracked lips

   your cousin is very very ill mr
tarr she said looking up with a
curious expression upon her face

   i am afraid he is i wish we were
ashore

   his mind seems weighed upon by
something-do you hear him

  tarr nodded and dropped his glance
for lie felt that there was something
more than ordinary curiosity behind her
question

   he says the same things over and
over that must be what the doctor
says is worrying him do-do you know
what it means mr tarr

   sick people in his condition usually
have their heads full of fancies he is
delirious i presume like any other
person suffering from such a trouble

   i believe that -his worriment is the
cause of his present condition helen
said firmly  and he says such strange
things

   i hadnt noticed muttered tarr

  but as she went out following her
aunt he knew that the look she gave
him showed serious doubt

  tarr avas in a cold perspiration
how much of crowdings babblings had
helen heard and understood

   by gad  if she is wise to much of it
and knows what he means shes better
at guessing than  am he muttered
when he was alone

  he was convinced however that he
had much better remain by his cousin
all the time and let nobody else care for
him he was likely to say something
downing the king-pin

that would reveal the mystery whatever

ii	was and tarr felt that he lacked only
the keyword to explain the secret about
which crowding muttered

   suppose the doctor or helen or some
other visitor should discover this se-
cret suppose while helen sat there
this very hour crowding had murmured
the keyword to the problem tarr
looked at the paper again

  the red diamond i must

open- open what ah if

crowding should say what he wished
opened while tarr was absent

    i must remain here from this time
on until we land nobody must learn
the meaning of his mystery until i have
found it out myself hetold himself

   he was not disturbed by visitors -for
the remainder of the afternoon and
nobody but the physician came to the
cabin during the evening excepting the
steward with ice and with his own
dinner

   the change in the weather which had
threatened early that morning finally
culminated in a thunder storm and elec-
tric display about nine oclock this
drove everybody below but the officers
and members of the crew whose duty it
was to remain on deck

   but after the rain stopped an hour
later tarr set open his door and sat
there watching the foam-flecked sea and
dun clouds for a long time sea and
sky were as perturbed and troubled as
his own mind

chapter xviii

an abtoundtng message

  the thunder storm was a prelude to
a bad night-the overture of a wag-
nerian session of wind rain and beaten
maddened sea after midnight the re-
turn of the rain drove tarr inside the
stateroom and a little later he heard
the men rigging life-lines along the
upper deck

  the yantic began to heave unpleas-
antly too and the slapping of the
waves against her tall hull sounded like
the crac-k of a long pennant in a hurri-
cane now and then the clouds seemed
to open and the water came down by the
bucketful

  a the night grew old and the worrv

of the storm increased the sounds evi-
dently made some impress on crowd-
ings troubled brain once he weakly
rose up in liis berth-something he had
not done for hours-and looked wildly
about

  at the moment be came close to being
conscious-he knew that he was in
i arr s room and that his cousin was
with him the latter had sprung to his
side and enfolded the mans form in his
own strong arms

   wha-what is it  gapped the sick
man

   its storming old man lie down
its all right said tarr soothingly

  the patients eyes rolled around in
their sockets till their glance was
focused upon his nurse tlien suddenly
he whispered

    what day is it 

   saturday morning replied tarr in
amazement

  saturday-saturday- my god

let me get up i must stop it  must

stop it only one hundred-

  his eyes were glazed with delirium
again he sank back upon the pillow
and was babbling his mysterious phrases
once more the momentary hash of
intelligence had gone

  but this incident assured tarr that
lie was right the moment would come
when crowdings secret could be ob-
tained by his nurse

   nothing shall get me out of this
room again if i can help it thought
tarr  and the next time he shows
the least intelligence ill ask him what
it is he wants opened ill get to the
root of the matter then

  it was almost dawn when he looked
out of his stateroom door again upon
the wet and glistening deck torn rags
of cloud were scurrying overhead ap-
parently scarcely out of the reach of the
steamships snubbed bowsprit as she
shot heavenward upon the heave of
every giant wave

   about these tattered storm-flags was a
heavy and impenetrable blanket of mist
of a dun color excepting where the wind
had whitened the edges the dawning
day threatened to give the passengers
of the yantic a taste of the atlantic in
her worst mood


the argosy

  a sailor was pacing the deck directly
before the stateroom door and lie
turned quickly to look at tarr when the
latter appeared the passenger was re-
minded of the surveillance which he had
noted the evening before but put it
away

   my imagination is getting the better
of my common sense he muttered as
he looked off across the sea he had
to cling to a line the instant he stepped
out upon the deck for the slant of the
planks was painfully acute

  far out on the sea line he observed
a smudge of smoke he thought of the
babbler which was somewhere in this
part of the ocean if the report from the
savoird was true

   what do you suppose that is out
yonder he asked the sailor

  the latter glanced up at the shrouded
figure on the bridge before replying in a
low tone

   i couldnt just say sir barring that
its a steamship shes likely one of
our own line or a cunarder it might
be the peruvian monarch she should
pass us hereabouts shes a-many miles
away from us sir

   you have no sure way of telling at
this distance  asked tarr curiously

   not now sir if its the monarch
shell send aboard the news youll get
it at breakfast in the extry news-
letter

   oh bv the wireless system  

   aye sir

  an officer approached and the sailor
turned quickly away tarr went back
into his room and lay down a bit as
crowding seemed very quiet the con-
stant strain and his sleepless night had
exhausted him and he sank into a
slumber that was only broken when a
steward came with his coffee

  beside the urn was a note from the
captains clerk

   captain holds requests mr tarrs
presence in his the captains cabin im-
mediately

   what the devil does that mean  
growled tarr  what does he want of
me  

   i could not tell you sir said the
man politely

   but i cant go down there now i
cant leave my cousin alone

   the clerk told me to remain with

him if you so desired sir

   you can tell the clerk with my com-
pliments to go to the devil  exclaimed
tarr in a rage the order stirred his
bile no offense to you young man
but crowding is much too ill for me to
leave him

   but its the captains command
sir said the steward softly

  when the doctor comes up ill see
about it meanwhile if captain holds
wishes to see me he knows where i am
the steward looked horrified but
there was nothing more to say and he
hackcd out of the rocnn

   catch me chasing around at the
beck and call of that pig-headed eng-
lishman muttered tarr who vividly
remembered the manner of the com-
mander the day before

  ten minutes later mr brier rapped
at the door of the cabin the purser
was buttoned tightly into his uniform
his face was very red and lie puffed as
though he had hastened up from his
room which was the truth

   see here you sir  lie exclaimed
mr tarr if thats your name the
captain wants you at once

  tarr was by no means appeased and
he stepped out of the room closed the
door so as not to disturb the sick man
and shook his fist in the pursers face

   who the dickens are you speaking
to   he demanded in a tone which made
brier draw back do you think im
one of your crcw  my passage is paid
for on this steamship and was paid for
by a man who may have some influence
with the directors of the blue crescent
line

   i consider that ive borne from your
captain about all ill stand now take
that back to him with my compliments
and let me tell you sir when you speak
to me to be a little careful what you
say and how you say it 

  brier had been opening and shutting
his month like a fish trying to get a
word in edgewise all this time now he
sputtered forth

   i-i reckon the man who sent you
here wont have much influence with the
owners by the time you reach land mr
tarr and passenger or not you must
obey the captain of this ship
downing the king-pin



    ill see him hanged first  declared
tarr with emphasis  when the doc-
tor comes up to look after my cousin i ll
call on the captain but not before

    sir sir  gasped brier

  but the passenger turned on his heel
and went back into the room

  mr brier had been routed out of his
early morning nap it was his watch be-
low to bring tarr into the captains
presence he knew better than to ap-
pear before captain holds without him

  but having had a chance to cool a
little he favored accomplishing his ends
without further trouble with the obsti-
nate passenger so down he trotted to
the surgeon and in a little while dr
meachem entered the besieged cabin

  great scott he said youll get
yourself into serious trouble sir ill
stay with the patient--how is he this
morning-while you go down and see
the captain

    well i dont know whether i will or
not said tarr

   come come mr tarr  advised the
physician  dont get into unnecessary
trouble dont make matters worse
than they are

  tarr wondered what he meant by this
but although tempted to ask him he
would not do so finally putting on his
hat and raincoat and stepping out upon
the deck

  mr brier was waiting for him and
favored the obstinate passenger with no
cheerful face

  oh come along exclaimed tarr
in disgust  yourehere to take me to
the captain i suppose but id like to
know what these actions mean

  brier grunted and went ahead rap-
ping at the door of the captains private
suite of rooms when he got an an-
swer from the commander he opened the
door motioned the passenger inside and
shut the door quickly remaining outside
himself

  captain holds in a rather undress
uniform of peajacket over his pajamas
and a steamer rug wrapped loosely
about his legs was seated at the table
in the chart room he wore a white
nightcap too which made his face seem
redder than usual

   well young man youve taken your
time in coming here  he exclaimed

  usually do returned tarr

  w hat do you want of me i am not
used to having the captains of third-
rate steamers like the yantic play the
grand mogul with me what is your
meaning any way

   look here sir-

   and you listen to me cried tarr
angrily   ou insulted me yesterday
on your bridge let me tell you that
the officials of the blue crescent line
will be held accountable for your ac-
tions

   and ordering me through a subor-
dinate to your cabin is not one of the
least things for which you will have to
answer

  holds looked at him from under his
shaggy gray brows

   i dont know whether you are a fool
or a knave young man he growled

   and  am quite convinced in my
mind which you are tarr said with
blazing eyes  in addition  wish to
know at once why you called me here
i am in no mood for conversation with
you captain holds be quick please

  the commander of the yantic looked
for a moment as though his temper
would burst all bounds of control but
finally he gulped down his choler and
suddenly spread a sheet of paper on the
table between himself and the passen-
ger

   sec here he growled  heres an-
other message we just received it from
the peruvian monarch which passed us
somewhere to the northard an hour or
more ago

  of what interest is it to me de-
manded tarr coolly

 its addressed to you young man
was the captains surprising statement

  a wireless telegram to me ex-
claimed tarr and seized the paper in
vast amazement

  the reading of the message did not
serve to decrease his wonderment

  mk horace tarr str yantic blue
crescent line-transmitted for b bur-
jess yet babbler by peruvian monarch
of the green star line your trunk on
yantic by mistake open it at once
matter of life or death

very likely tarr read these lines over
at least ten times and the tenth time he


the argosy

understood quite as much of what he
read as he did the first-and that was
nothing at all

  the words were there it was type-
written in english all right but the
message itself made absolutely no in-
telligent impression on his brain

    well sir well sir  snapped the
captain at length   hat does that
mean  

  but tarr looked at him with unseeing
eyes nor did he hear him for a moment
instead he was trying to make head or
tail of the telegram

  was it a joke  was somebody trying
to play upon his credulity

  it was hard enough for a man to be-
lieve in the reality of the wireless tele-
graph any way-at least so tarr told
himself but to believe that a sane man
like brandon burgess would be trav-
eling about the north atlantic on a big
steam yacht searching for this steam-

to he c

ship merely for the sake of telling him
that there had been a mistake in a
trunk-

  what could it mean  was it the
trunk he had sent aboard the babbler
as lie supposed the evening before the
sailing of the yantic was it the
trunk marked with the red diamond and
his own initials-the trunk of which he
had been reminded when trimble
looked through the hold ol the steam-
ship for helen trainors missing prop-
erty 

  but here captain holds driven to
desperation brought his fist down with
a crash upon the table and swore a
round oath

  answer me sir what does that
mean be roared starting from his
seat and facing tarr across the table
 answer me sir or by heaven ill
put you in the brig passenger or no
passenger 
itinued

the run on the herdsmans

by edgar franklin

face to face with disaster and the intangible ally that was finally enlisted in the fight against it

there was a time even now not
beyond the memory of some of
our graybeards when chicago and
harksbury stood upoii a precisely equal
footing as regarded the killing of
beeves and the shipping of meat

  then times changed as times will
and men and their plans changed with
them the capital that was interested
in meat-packing seemed inexplicably to
flow toward chicago in harksbury the
industry stood still

  unavailing efforts were made to re-
vive that beautiful temporary boom
the huge graves slaughter-house con-
tinued a brisk enough business-even
built a group of additions in the course
of time and eventually a big refriger-
ating plant-and some half-dozen
smaller establishments still operated
but that was the extent of beef-dressing
done at harksbury

  however the little town was not alto-
gether idle in other directions shoe

factories grew up and a monster tin-
plate plant the population swelled
from four figures to five and progressed
cheeringly into the teens of thousands
and harksbury came to be in every way
a satisfactory city

  it was a great point of pride with
harksbury that everything in town was
solid everything paid and kept on pay-
ing

  there was money and to spare for all
requirements public and private-for
asphalt streets and electric lights and
sewers for residences that grew more
ornate and expensive with each new
erection for churches and schools and
libraries harksbury in a word existed
calmly and happily in that heavenly
state we call assured prosperity

  conceive therefore the shock when
one morning during the last money
panic harksbury awoke to find that the
triit company had closed its doors

  there were many who had had open
r

the run on

    misgivings about that trust company
    and they wove a placid i-told-you-so air
    that maddened many others who had
    not

      the former contingent was frank in
    believing that the smash would have
    come iu any event the latter knew for
    a moral certainty-which was the fact
    by the way-that the prevailing up-
    heaval in the money world had been at
    the bottom of the affair

      at any rate the trust company was
    out of business temporarily at least
    and a slate of things ensued hitherto
    unknown to smug little harksbury

      something past noon that day the
    poor young stone street bank began
    to feel a sad tugging at its purse-strings

the tugging increased-the tuggers
grew from a long line to an uneasy
 crowd

      the stone street people paid and
    paid and paid until three oclock next
    morning they continued paying and
    paying and paying

       and at noon three or four policemen
    gently persuaded the depositors to step
    outside and the big doors closed and
    a weary-looking clerk stepped up inside
    and pasted a little white notice on the
    glass panel

      the stone street bank had sus-
    pended too

       two of itarksburys financial institu-
     tions had gone by the board-two re-
     mained the bank of harksburv and
     the herdsmans bank down bv the
     stockyards

      the former held the bulk of harks-
    burys ready money and the way that
    harksburv having regained breath
    descended upon it was what is some-
    times termed a caution

       huge notices were posted at the be-
    ginning of the rush little circulars were
    even mailed to the depositors that first
    evening frankly setting forth the sitna-
    lion and making it clear that harksburv
    had it within her power either to wreck
    or to perpetuate her main bank

      perhaps the arguments appealed to
    the depositors collectively it is very
    likely that they did but individually
    each of them wanted his money and
    wanted it right away and the simplest
    method of satisfying the want was to
    take the next trolley down-town and get

the herdsmans	

on the line that stretched a block be-
yond the harksburv bank

  lhis last run had been going on for
one solid drearv day and part of an-
other when young robert janewav
superintendent of the graves packing
establishment and refrigerating plant
stepped across the alley that separated
the abattoir from the herdsmans
bank to pay a morning call upon his
brother richard who happened to be
eashier of the institution

  he found the latter with an out-
thrust under lip and au unlighted cigar
staring with just the least suggestion of
a frown at the calendar on his desk

  ilis face cleared though as the little
door swung open and he turned with a
cheery

   hello bob

   hello dick the younger man
found himself a chair and reached over
for the cigar-case that lay in sight
 you look chipper

   feel so-reasonably

   youre not worried then

  not particularly

   things seem to be getting pretty
lively up-town-they say theres a
dickens of a run on the harksbury
the cashier smiled amiably

   so i hear

  well why hasnt it struck the
herdsmans thats what beats me
ilis brother laughed

   it doesnt beat me bob ive been
giving a bit of thought to the subject-
naturally-and i cant see any real
reason why there should be a run here
for one thing were the richest bank in
town

   even so the depositors have just
that much more to get scared about

   very true but theres another point
as well my boy-most of our depositors
live out of town-in the cattle country
and elsewhere

   the shoe factory people dont

   no of course not but a great part
of the others do news doesnt reach
them so quickly

  maybe not but when it does-
phew wont there be a rush for harks-
lury 

   i dont know that there will

   i do youll see those drovers
flock in here by hundreds and roar out


the argosy

for their cash dont believe it eh
you never can tell whats going to hap-
pen at a time like this 

 no as a matter of fact bob i don t
believe it still -his face grew grave
-it is very true that one can t tell
 and suppose there was a run 
could vou stand it  

  -the elder janeway chewed
his cigar- it would depend very
largely on the size of the run things
are strained mighty hard just now as
you seem to be aware we havent much
money and wed have to scratch like sin
to get more nevertheless we could
stand any ordinary demands on us

   if they come they wont be ordinary
-ill gamble on that 

   look here my pessimistic young
brother said the cashier  will you
kindly drv up about runs and such like
cheerful things dont you suppose
ive been over this devilish situation
somewhere between three and four
thousand times if a run should come
wed have to do the best we know how-
thats all but ive got my mind firmly
made up that there isnt going to be any
tun-sort of christian science or new
thought treatment i guess-and if you
have no objection well let it rest at that
until were forced to do otherwise

   good sensible way to look at it
the graves superintendent commented

  he nodded to some one passing the
glass partition

  whos that richard behind his
desk could not sec the entrance

   carter dick

   frank carter

   same old frank carter manager of
the smith shoe factory

yes the cashier shook his head
impatiently  hes after his payroll
confound him i wish to heaven theyd
postpone payday for a week this time 
  hat does it amount to 

   oh about nineteen hundred as a
rule thunder i dont want to pay
that out to-day 

   cant be helped smiled his brother
   no i suppose it cant

  richard janeway drummed on his
desk for a moment and mentally con-
demned people who hail to have payrolls
in the middle of a money panic he
turned quickly as a teller entered

   what is it brown  

   mr carter mr janeway hes just
turned in his check for live thousand
four hundred 

  fifty-four hundred the cashier
gasped  what the deuce does he want
all that for 

   dont know sir it wipes out his
account to a few dollars  think

   five thousand four hundred dol-
lars muttered the elder janeway
its nearly four thousand more than
lies ever drawn on monday before 

   yes sir

   must be taking on new hands up at
the shoe place the young brother com-
mented facetiously  thats a husky
little payroll dick

  the cashier scowled then turned to
the teller with a resigned shrug

   well give it to him thats all
brown

   very well sir

  the door clicked again and the
cashier whistled softly his brother
wagged a knowing head

   what did i tell you  

   theres no need to gloat over it
bob carters taken a bit of a fright-
thats all it amounts to i dont blame
him altogether

  and he looks relieved there he
goes now with a wad of greenbacks big
enough to fill a wheelbarrow

   fifty-four-hundred   richard
repeated under his breath  well i
hope most fervently that hes the first
and last of his kind

   so do i

   oh pshaw he must be  the
cashier was trying hard to convince him-
self  theres nothing to justify a run
on this bank were fully equal to
weathering even this crisis if theyll let
us alone were solid in so many

ways--

  aha another

   another what  

   another old friend dick look at
him

  the cashier arose and glanced along
the bank he sat down again with a
smile of satisfaction

   thats only old jim coles the cat-
tleman this is his day for depositing-
fifth of the month you kuow well
that means live or six hundred at least
the run on the herdsmans



 does it though  is he in the habit
of depositing his cash at the paying
tellers window

  the what  

  hes standing there now yes as
 sure as youre born hes passing in a
 check to be cashed  

  good lord  

 richard janeway was on his feet
 again he squinted down toward the
 window finally he strolled through the
 little cages toward the teller

 he glanced casually over the clerks
 shoulder there lay a check laboriously
 signed janies c coles and written
 for three thousand dollars

  ah good-morning mr coles said
 the cashier with a smile in which the
 pleasure was plainly forced

  hornin the drovers volubility
 seemed to have vanished

  fine day isnt it

  tolerble

  making a draft on us i see  

  yep

  going to do some buying 

  nope

 janeway was rather nonplussed
 coles seemed dogged and avoided meet-
 ing his eye he shifted before the win-
 dow for a moment then grunted some-
 what gruffly

  gimme fifties and hundreds mister
 im in a hurry

 he received his money and left
 quickly the cashier returned to the
 office a troubled light in his eyes

  how much asked the graves
 superintendent

  three thousand bob nearly nine
 thousand dollars paid out in ten min-
 utes  

  phew 

 i wonder- jimminv it does

 look as if it were coming 

  i should say it did and when that

 eleven oclock train gets in-

  its going to bring some of our out-
 of-town friends yes im afraid thats
 not outside the possibilities

 robert glanced at the clock and re-
 called that the graves company was not
 paying him a salary for morning calls
 he strolled to the door of the office and
 was about to say good-by when the tele-
 phone bell took to ringing lie paused
 the cashier stepped to the phone

       a

   hello hello yes-janeway yes

oh is this you thomason 

  thomason eh muttered the
younger brother  the bank of harks-
bury must be on the wire 

   es i-is that so-yes i knew
about it-what what-just now
great csesar-all right thanks for let-
ting us know-no i dont see that we
can do anything else-no-good-by
when richard janeway turned back
his face was several shades paler

   well the harksbury has closed up
bob

   harksbury too 

   yes thomason says that all the
big depositors must have secured first
places on the line theyve been abso-
lutely cleaned out-he says theyve got
about seven dollars in cash-all told
 good gracious 

   and were next now  groaned the
cashier  the christian science treat-
ment was no go was it 

   seems not

   well skip out of here bob the
cashier ran his fingers through his hair
 ill have to think up some scheme or
other-im blest if i know what
with sympathetic words the graves
superintendent left

  from his private office at the top of
the next building he watched almost in
voluntarily for a sight he knew to be
inevitable

  he was not disappointed just before
half-past eleven knots of three or four
were to be seen coming down the street
below-big burly rough-clad men from
the ranches

  they hurried too and at the door of
the herdsmans bank they disappeared
afterward singly they emerged and
walked away more slowly

  the news had indeed traveled and
the run on the bank was under way

  the one oclock train brought more-
the one-fifty still more they appeared
regularly at the corner of the street
leading to the railway station others
resident depositors could be seen drop-
ping olf the trolley cars twoblocks away
and scurrying toward the bank

  within an hour robert came to know
perfectly what their movements would
be

  they popped into view walking leis-


the argosy

urely they looked down the street and
saw a group of people and quickened
their pace coming nearer they knew
the group to be at the herdsman s and
they ran the last half-block at lull tilt

  at two or three-minute intervals they
stirred swayed forward and  parted
again a man walked out and stepped
briskly up the street carrying in his
pocket just so and so many dollars from
the herdsmans treasury

  thus far it was a very quiet orderly
proceeding but for the bank it was
spelling disaster with a large d

  something past three robert man-
aged another trip to his brothers office

  the doors were closed and in the
street a crowd of unsatisfied men talked
rapidly and loudly there were gesticu-
lations and here and there a candid
shaking of fists

  the general opinion was all too evi-
dent-they were first on the spot and
there they would remain until the bank
opened on the morrow and business was
resumed regardless of the eighteen or
nineteen hours of discomfort that must
ensue they formed in regular order
along the wall some lounging some sit-
ting on the pavement some calling to
passing boys to bring them sandwiches
or some other refreshment

  the cashiers face was drawn when
his brother entered for the second time
that day

   your friends seem determined the
latter remarked

   theyre all of that bob

   are they going to spend the night
there 

   looks like it

   pshaw  how are things going 

   rotten  replied the cashier tersely
and inelegantly

   cash running out  

   running out no its not-it has
run out 

   all gone  

   all but three or four hundred dol-
lars bob i instructed the tellers to
dilly-dally and fuss and fumble as much
as they could and i fancy that theyve
been doing it but if three oclock had
been ten minutes later we should have
had to suspend to-day 

   and as it is 

   we shall have to suspend about ten

minutes after we open to-morrow
said the cashier bitterly  mercifully a
lot of the little fellows came in first -
thats all that saved us this afternoon
when we open in the morning-well
theres bain bridge cashier of the tin-
plate works sitting on the step hes
third in the line

   how much will he want 

   seven thousand and something
cant you see him getting it richard
laughed harshly

  it-it does look bad the graves
superintendent contributed

   bad its more than bad-its abso-
lute ruin and the worst of it is that
its entirely unnecessary this fiendish
situation isnt going to last more than a
day or two longer-i had wires from
chicago this morning stating that two
or three of the big fellows are going to
resume the panic will be over at the
end of the week-all over and this
bank needirl break at all unless the
depositors go to work deliberately and
smash it as they did the harksburv
why on earth cant the fools realize
that why cant they-oh damn
outside the broad window two or
three had taken note of the cashiers
excited mien and commented thereon
several more hurried to the bars before
the pane and stared curiously inward

  richard sat down with his back to the
crowd and lit a cigar

   well cussing wont help it much
his brother observed

   im afraid it wont but-oh well
theyll have it their own way any way i
suppose first come first served and
the devil take the hindmost 

   looks as if he would too just now
see here dick have you done anything
toward getting more cash

   not being entirely daft  have
but it wont help us now that  can see
t sent burroughs the assistant cashier
up to chicago on the two oclock ex-
press hell get in too late to do any-
thing much to-day in the morning
ive ordered him to hustle about and
raise all the money he can before the
eleven oclock train leaves well have
to shut up shop long before eleven
oclock however as things appear now
-and he may not be able to get any
money at that
the run on the herdsmans

   hum

  robert janeway had taken to sharp-
ening his pencil in an absent-minded
fashion having achieved the very per-
fection of smooth points lie proceeded
further lo carefully carve scrolls along
the length of wood that accomplished
lie set about rounding off the end

  finally however he snapped the
knife-blade and looked across at his
brother with a queer little grin

   dick that fatal rim is cock-sure
to come in the morning isnt it

   cock-sure

   and youd like to avoid it

   yes wed be real happy to avoid it
his brother acquiesced dryly

    all right then  we will

   hey  

 i said that wed try avoiding it
u what the deuce have you in mind  
whats in the cellar inquired
the graves superintendent irrelevantly
 eh  why the vaults of course

   what else  

   oh old packing-cases in the rear
i suppose and the gas-meter and the
furnace and a couple of broken chairs
why  

   never mind is our old friend
timothy still night watchman

   of course

   all right you be sure to tell
tiinothv to come over and see me as
soon as he reports for work fm going
to spend a few hours with him to-night
just for sociabilitys sake as it were
and the bank will open its door on time
to-morrow morning and therell be no
run ill guarantee that

  but-

   oh dont bother about details as
a reputable bank official you might
have a conscience and object anybody
like me who associates with a few thou-
sand chilled corpses every day cant be
expected to distinguish between the
strictly right and the possibly wrong
you send timothy over come down to
business on time in the morning-and
leave the rest to me good-afternoon
lii chard

  he was gone and richard janeway
having stared at the closed door for a
moment turned savagely to his desk
and came near to swearing at a brother
who could be flippant at such a time

  toward evening though he grew
more desperate more in a mood to
snatch at straws file outlook was ini-
coming blacker and blacker and when
timothy appeared just as he was about
to lease the cashier paused and with
shame in his heart directed him to step
across the back alley to the packing-
house and ask for mr robert janeway
who wished to see him

  i-ie had no particular desire to push
through that inquiring crowd outside
he left by the rear entrance and sur-
veyed the ground from the corner

  undeniably there was a quantity of
anxious ones down there by the door
the line had grown-longer and
thicker it covered almost the block
and reenforcements were arriving all
the time another train would be due
from the ranch country at ten-another
at eight next morning what would
happen at nine when the bank was to
open for business 

  janeway knew his clientele-knew
that they lived near to nature and that
natural instinct predominated when
they found that their money was not
forthcoming would they break loose

  would they not very likely tumble
pell-mell into the bank and essay a loot
-where there was nothing to loot-
was there not a very good chance of
their swarming in and attempting to
shoot up the outfit 

  well they were perfectly welcome to
try it having demolished the business
standing of the institution they might
as well make an end of the structure
itself if it pleased them

  the cashier shrugged his shoulders
again and strode oif for the car-line

  he waited through most of the night
for news from burroughs for he had
directed that any important cheering in-
formation should be sent to his home
none came and toward morning he
snatched a few hours of sleep

  throughout the panic he had con-
sidered that the game was fairly within
his hands now it had left them entirely
and he became resigned to the end

  he walked to the herdsmans bank
next morning fully prepared to see the
throng further augmented clamoring
at the doors

  he was most pleasantly disappointed


the argosy

  not only were the depositors refrain-
ing from battering down the panels
but they seemed to have conceived an
actual distaste for the herdsman s
bank for fifty feet either way there
was not a soul on the sidewalk-most of
the waiting crowd had assembled across
the street

  among those nearest the bank he
recognized the clerical force some of
them bareheaded standing about and
talking hard among themselves he
pushed closer and i rom half a dozen
directions at once he heard the word
ammonia and wondered further

  then he was through and in the open
space-and he found himself choking
and gagging the air was filled to suffo-
cation with the odor of ammonia 

  the doors of the herdsmans were
open and the unbearable stench seemed
to surge through and into the outer air
janeway recalled his brothers words of
the night before stared hard at the
open doors and shook his head

  for the moment it was beyond him

  he searched for brown the paying
teller and found him devoid of hat and
with red running eyes

   whats happened brown

   the lord only knows mr jane-
way the teller coughed and wheezed
 we were just getting ready to open
up when-it came

 it what

  that fearful ammonia sir great
scott its something awful in there
it just seemed to pour in from every-
where at once theres no living within
ten yards of the place sir

   but where the deuce does it come
from  

   one of the ice-machines in the cold-
storage plant next door burst they say
we sent word around to know what was
up and thats what they told us they
hope to have it fixed by noon sir

  the cashier shielding his nose and
mouth with a handkerchief tried to
enter and investigate he walked
through the very doors watched
curiously by the crowd and stepped
into the main aisle of the bank

  his stay was brief there seemed no
breath of air in the place-every cubic
inch had been replaced by the strang-
ling fumes of ammonia gas

  with an effort and a distress that
were in no way simulated janeway stag-
gered into the open air fell and was
dragged away by a daring clerk

  he recovered himself in a minute or
two and one great fact rose uppermost
in his mind-beyond all dispute there
would be no run on the herdsmans
bank until the building was clear of
that infernal smell

  he permitted himself a quiet smile
whether this were chance or some of
roberts work the result was glowingly
perfect

  but a crowd of money-mad men do
not stand long upon ceremony a sort
of informal meeting took place at about
ten oclock and a delegation was ap-
pointed to call at the graves plant and
ask whether the ammonia could not be
cut off or turned away from the bank

  they were received most politely by
the superintendent he was charm-
ingly frank and anxious to please

  lie told them that one of the am-
monia ice-machines had broken during
the night while in charge of an inex-
perienced workmen that as they would
readily understand no repairs could be
made until that particular cylinder had
exhausted itself and they were able to
send workmen to the spot that how-
ever there was every prospect of their
getting at the job within fifteen minutes
or half an hour when the regrettable
nuisance would of course cease

  they asked why the bank was so full
of gas and he told them that the ma-
chine being located at the side which
abutted on the herdsmans had blown
away a portion of the wall and was dis-
charging its deadly vapors straight at
the bank he added a further brief dis-
sertation on the marvelous penetrating
powers of ammonia and suggested that
if any one doubted his words they might
step inside and conduct a personal in-
vestigation

  no one eared to attempt it the dele-
gation returned to the main body and
another consultation followed

  something like half an hour later
they reached a new conclusion

  it being plainly impossible to do
business in the herdsmans bank the
sole alternative was to do it outside
in short as a newly chosen committee
the run on the herdsmans

of three set forth to richard janeway
it was the duty of the bank officials to
bring forth their cash and their hooks
ailit conduct the banking in the street

  warrantably lie declined the com-
mittee returned very shortly a mur-
muring arose the crowd drew to-
gether and advanced as a solid mass
upon the cashier

  llere and there a rough shout arose
demanding that the money be brought
out and paid in order they crushed
against janeway and the tellers and
forced them along toward the wall of
the bank the ammonia notwithstanding

  when finally the vapors did halt
them the cashier leaped to one of the
lower window ledges and clinging by
the bars addressed them with pithy in-
formality

  see here all of you he shouted
i dont know whats wrong in there
but im not responsible for it and im
not going to lose my life by going into
the vaults for money-nor am i going
to sacrifice any of the employees
youll have to wait until the machine
can be fixed when business will be re-
sumed

  a dozen voices yelled at him and he
shouted again

   im sorry you dout like it but if
you think its possible to enter that
place just now go right in and take all
you can lay hands on  

  it was an unexpected suggestion and
excited as they were they adopted it
without due thought with a simul-
taneous impulse the crowd surged
about and straight toward the main
entrance

  jane way caught his breath and won-
dered for an instant whether he had not
been the most monumental kind of
idiot to make that last statement and
run the chance it entailed-but  it
was all over even then

  the leaders as they came to the open
doors shrieked aloud and pushed fran-
tically backward one or two fell prone
and were in danger of a trampling

  some five or six seconds they swayed
uncertainly-and the ammonia won
to the last man the depositors hed pre-
cipitately from the invisible invincible
foe

  no further talk of assault was heard



 ihere was a fluttering of handkerchiefs
 as eyes were wiped there were cough-
 ings innumerable and curses as well but
  one eared risking another rush
 they settled instead to a season of
 dogged waiting-for they wanted their
 money and some of them had spent the
 night waiting for it already and they
 would wait now until the ammonia had
 dissipated itself whether it consumed
 the day or the week

   w hen things in general had quieted
 down janeway heard the tolling of
 eleven from the distant city nail clock
 and some five or six minutes later he dis-
 tinguished the whistle of the outgoing
 train as it took a crossing beyond
 harksburv

   burroughs must be in town now
 what success had he to relate or had
 he returned emptv handed 

   it was an anxious quarter-hour for
 richard janeway alternately he
 watched the crowd and the streets the
 former was silent the latter empty

   he glanced finally at his watch it
 was twenty minutes past eleven-and
  burroughs

   but as he looked again a dust-cloud
 up crossley street resolved itself into
 a span of galloping horses janeway
 knew them on the instant-dr parkers
 gray team-and parker was a great
 friend of burroughs

   something less than a minute later
 all doubt was past with a clatter of
 hoofs and shouts of warning from the
 two men in the carriage the span
 trotted briskly through the crowd and
 drew up before the bank

   janeway waved them away from the
 entrance burroughs stood erect and
 in either hand was a heavy leather
 satchel

    its all right he sang out joy-
  ously  cadman and paulson have both
 started up again and the third
 national brooks  company and
 phillips brothers and three or four
 more resume to-morrow 

   did you get money the cashier
 inquired in low tones

    one hundred and fifty thousand
 right here i didnt even wait to get dev
 tectives to come with me 

   janeway leaped to his side and raised
 a hand for silence


the argosy

  will you please form in hue and
present checks to rue here he cried
  think-we shall be able to accommo-
date everybody jenkins and brown
will you come here and give me and
mr burroughs a hand

  human nature as some one may have
observed before this is a queer thing
five minutes before the croyd had been
almost ready for bloodshed so that it
secured them their money now anx-
ietv vanished as if by magic

  some two or three dozen lined up
beside the doctors carriage before
their turns came half had dropped out
the body of the throng talked excitedly
and argued among themselves for a
time and then departed

  the run on the herdsmans was prac-
tically over

  some thirty minutes later the street
was clear save for those directly inter-
ested in the banks operation janeway
was explaining to burroughs why the
place could not be entered when a voice
came from the doorway

wont you step in and sit dbwn

  it was the graves superintendent
hi face was covered by a heavy cloth
and he blinked painfully but some-
where behind the covering lurked the
emblance of a grin

   the airs more breathable now he
supplemented thickly

  but the best part of another half-
hour had elapsed before the brothers
choking still found themselves alone by
the open window of the cashiers office

   well the bank opened her doors
didnt she and there was no run was
there  

   there certainly was no run bob
how on earth did you manage to smash
an ice-machine in such a fashion that
this whole building next door was
filled  

u ice-maehines dont smash in a

plant that i run returned the younger

brother serenely  ours have been
going without a hitch for the last six
months

  then-

  where did the ammonia come
from how does this strike you 

  tie raised his arm and turned on the
gas-jet a strange lively hissing re-
sulted and he quickly shut it off again

 i guess youll smell a little more
ammonia in a minute he commented
the cashier smiled in bewilderment
 you dont mean to say that you
turned ammonia gas into those pipes
last night  

   but i did ray boy with the assist-
ance of your good timothy i opened
your supply pipe down-stairs by the
meter hitched ou a few lengths of
piping which protruded from our cellar
and coupled a cylinder of compressed
ammonia at the other end we left all
the gas-cocks opeu and at eight-thirty
sharp this morning  started things up
with a monkey wrench say dick you
should have seen your clerks break for
the open 

    well ill be everlastingly hanged 
the cashier muttered

   you neednt be it was a very
bright bizarre little idea i will admit
but its going to cost you just ninety-
seven dollars in cash thats the value
of the gas ive squirted in here to-day
and i dont care to have the transac-
tion on the books

  silently the cashier walked out
when he returned it was with a hundred-
dollar bill

  robert pocketed it indifferently
selected another cigar and headed for
the door

   ill keep the odd three he ob-
served  i need a new hat and ive
earned it by-by dicky get busy with
your banking business

a story of college life with a tragic start and an atmosphere of solution-defying mystery

synopsis of chapters previously published

    arthur stanton toastmaster of the freshman dinner at old orange college is kidnapped by nine
sophomores they give him chloroform to keep him quiet hut are horrorstricken to find him dead on their
hands it seems that he had been stabbed with a dagger of glass and the nine sophomores are summoned
to president cadys house where coroner jackson and chief of police cottrell place them under arrest
they have already been suspended for complicity in the murder of stanton who had been paying atten-
tion to effie hilton in whom courtney is also interested courtney is one of the nine but fails to respond
when his uaire is read off by cottrell it seem that he has been seen leaving town satchel in hand
a search of courtneys rooms shows that his departure was hurried and also results in tee finding of
the handle and upper portion of a glass dagger among his things -

    the eight sophomores present are placed under arrest and a telegram is sent to courtney he
appears on the following day under charge of officers sent to his native town whither he hd gone believing
himself expelled from the college by the rules already existing against hazing

     professor starling an amateur detective secretly undertakes the case and decides chat the murder
was committed by a woman the clues seem to lead to effie hilton

    at the preliminary trial it is discovered that miss hilton had in a spirit of perversity refused
courtneys offer of marriage telling him of a previous engagement to stanton which had been arranged
in their childhood by their respective parents

ormsbys testimony is the only direct evidence against courtney but the jury renders a verdict of guilty

chapter x

  the professor asks questions

after the coroners inquest court-
ney was taken back to his cell to
be kept there some weeks awaiting trial

  he had not been there for more than
half an hour when he received a visit
from professor w ilson of old orange
law school

   courtney began the professor
 at the request of president cady who
takes a warm interest in you and greatly
regrets the straits in which you are
placed i have come to offer to take your
case

  courtney was sitting dejectedly in a
corner of his cell with his elbows onhis
knees and his hands supporting liis chin

    very well he said almost listlessly
i shall be glad to have you undertake
my defense professor  know that if
anybody can save me you can 

   i can save you my boy and i will
i am going to make the fight of my life
to do it at present  must admit the
case against you looks pretty strong
even at the coroners inquest the police

have forged an almost incontrovertible
chain of evidence

   by the day of the trial they will have
strengthened this chain considerably in
all probability and you must admit that
the circumstances are all against you

   you didnt come here to tell me
that professor protested bob wearily

    knowi did not now courtney
my boy this sullen air will not do at
all dont act like a guilty man for 
know that you are not such throw up
your head and keep up your spirits and
we will break through this cloud yet
you must give me all the help you can
though my boy

  i help vou why how can  do
that  

   easily first of all you must an-
swer all my questions truthfully re-
member i am your counsel and you must
conceal nothing from me now i want
to know how the police came to find that
dagger in your room

   see here professor wilson said
courtney starting suddenly to his feet
 t of course appreciate your desire to
help me and naturally i have no wish to
the two back numbers will be mailed to any

 this story began in the june issue of tub argosy

address on receipt of  ccnts


the argosy

die an ignominious death on tlie gallows
if i can help it but nevertheless i can-
not answer a single one of your ques-
tions-that one particularly if you
want to undertake my defense you must
do it without asking me to answer a
single question i would rather go to the
gallows than do so

   well well this is most extraor-
dinary said professor wilson in
amazement   never heard of a
prisoner refusing to confide in his coun-
sel before except when he was guilty of
the crime and even then many have
trusted their lawyers with a full con-
fession beforehand and got off scot free
as a consequence

   think me guilty if you want to pro-
fessor said courtney with a bitter
laugh  perhaps i am those are the
only terms however on which  will
consent to being defended at all if
you want to take up my case you must
not  repeat expect me to answer a
single question

   but my dear fellow dont be ab-
surd how can i build up any sort of
defense without your help be reason-
able tell me at least why you fled to
slocum corners instead of awaiting de-
velopments as the others did

  i can tell you nothing professor
if you cant build up a defense without
my help why let me hang i wont
blame you any

  youre not guilty are you my
boy  asked the lawyer in so anxious a
tone that the words were robbed of all
offense

    you can believe me so if you wish
replied courtney obstinately  i may
plead not guilty to the charge or i may
change my mind even about that
what do i care if i am hanged or if i
am freed  

   and you wont tell me how that
dagger came into your room

   i must respectfully decline

   you are assuming a very foolish at-
titude

  possibly so but remember profes-
sor these are the only terms on which
i will consent to being defended at all
dont think please that i do not appre-
ciate your kindness and thekindness of
president cady it is impossible how-
ever for me to make any explanations

about this affair i must let things
take their course and trust to fate
if you persist in this silence there
is not one chance in a thousand of
getting you off do you understand
that

  bobs only reply was a shrug of his
shoulders

   well said professor wilson al-
most angrily  perhaps youll change
your mind later on and desist from this
stubborn course  will leave you now
and do all i can to help you think
this thing over and see if you would not
be doing better by taking me into your
confidence

  professor wilson left the prison and
as he walked up the road to the uni-
versity he met professor starling

  hello wilson exclaimed the lat-
ter  just been to visit your client i
suppose  

  yes  have was the moody reply
 guess you will have a hard job to
get him acquitted eh

   i shant be able to get him ac-
quitted at all burst out wilson angrily
 the confounded young ass will hang
for a crime i am almost sure he did not
commit

   what you dont mean to say you
have despaired of the case already

   yea that is just what  do mean to
say i cant get any help out of the
young fool he wont answer any of
my questior or take me into his con-
fidence at ill maintains a haughty
indifferent manner as if i were the pub-
lic prosecutor instead of the lawyer for
the defense

  the deuce you say did you tell
him that he was running a desperate
risk by such a course  

   i most certainly did i told him he
would positively hang if he did not open
up to me the silly ass replied that he
didnt care if he was hanged or not
 most extraordinary attitude to as-
sume well we must save him some
way

  save him with that strong cir-
cumstantial evidence against him  tell
you there isnt a chance in the world
why  almost begin to believe in his
guilt myself

   nevertheless we will save him i
am working on this thing too my dear
who and why 



wilson before the day of the trial i
will put you in possession of some evi-
dence which will surprise you as much
as it will the judge and the jury court-
ney will go free without any doubt

   you surprise me greatly starling
rejoined the lawyer  cant you give
me tliis evidence now and allow me more
time to amplify  

   no i cant do that because there are
still some links incomplete and i want
to work the whole thing up to a finish
alone and unaided perhaps in a day
or two though i will offer you the
results of my careful investigations
which will cause a greater surprise than
any scandal which has ever shaken old
orange society

   you dont tell me well i am all
impatience to hear what it can he 
hope that it is really good and strong
for the case certainly needs it we
havent got a leg to stand on at present
with courtneys confounded obstinacy
to handicap us

   wait until  get through and you
will have two legs to stand on my dis-
closures will also explain somewhat
courtneys stubbornness  think
with that the two professors parted
late that evening professor starling
paid a visit to the home of the hiltons

   is miss hilton within he asked
of the maid who responded to his ring

   no sir none of the family is home
at present

   good my girl tell me what is your
name

   ruth sir

   well ruth can vou tell me what
this is  

   it looks like a ten-dollar bill sir
answered the girl

   exactly a bright girl-a very
bright girl one of the brightest girls
 have seen for many years this is
a ten-dollar bill-absolutely correct
now how would you like to own this
ten-dollar bill ruth

  the girl appeared undecided whether
to close the door in this strange mans
face or to continue the colloquy avarice
inclined her to the latter course how-
ever ten dollars was a lot of money in
her eyes

   what is it you want   she asked
suspiciously

   dont be alarmed ruth i am pro-
fessor starling of old orange univer-
sity see here is my card i want you
to answer a few questions in return for
which you shall receive this brand new
ten-dollar bill is it a go

    v	ou can ask the questions sir re-
plied the girl pertly  if i dont care
to answer them thats another matter

   well for a starter what kind of
perfume does miss effie use 

  what an extraordinary question
why i guess there is no harm in
answering that jockey club sir

   jockey club very good very
good indeed ruth and what kind of
note paper does your miss eftie use gen-
erally  

   that i dont know sir i think she
has several kinds of writing paper as
all young ladies have-some fancy and
some plain

  humph now tell me ruth just
what you know about poor mr stanton
did he come to this house ver- often 
 he did sir quite often

   and was he very friendlv with miss
effie

   he was sir we understood as how
they was once going to be married

   do you think that miss eftie is
very grieved over his death

   she does take on a little about it
but then of course it didnt mean so

much to her since- the girl

stopped abruptly and colored up

   since what go on my gill said
the professor eagerly

   nothing sir my how ones
tongue do slip away with them when
one isnt careful i was goin to say
something i shouldnt have mentioned
 oh yes you should ruth coaxed
the professor in his most wheedling
tone  since what  come tell me 
 i cant sir it is something that i
mustnt tell to anybody

  the professor held the ten-dollar bill
temptingly before the girls eyes

   tell me what you want to know and
what all this questioning means she
demanded

   i want to try to clear an innocent
man of the charge of murder if you
will tell me all you know my girl you
will save an innocent man from the gal-
lows if you hold back important evi-


the argosy

dence yon are a murderess do you
hear that ruth-a murderess 

  the girl shuddered

   it isnt for the ten dollars sir-
dont think that lor a minute but i
cant see anybody what is innocent suf-
fer hanging by the neck untii he is dead
and i dont want to be no murderess- 
 then tell me what it was that hap-
pened which made miss effie care less
for poor stanton than she did for-
merly-

   well sir they had a quarrel

   a quarrel what about my girl
come tell me all you know and  will
add another five dollars to this ten

  the girls eyes sparkled greedily

    dont know how they started it
sir you see i only heard it from out-
side in the hallway you see  couldnt
help hearing it sir they spoke in such
loud voices i hope you wont think
that i would deliberately listen at a key-
hole sir

   of course you wouldnt my girl
tell me quickly what did you accident-
ally hear - 

   i heard mr stanton tell miss effie
that he was going to get married to an
actres and he asked miss effie to re-
lease him from his promise to marry
her

and what did miss effie say

   she seemed kind of bitter spoke
in that loud haughty tone she can use
so well she said something about mr
stantons being mistaken about there
being any arrangement between them
that she hadnt made up her mind to
accept him any way she hoped that
they would both be very happy she
didnt sound as if she meant what she
said though for she seemed horribly
angry

  and what happened after that
 mr stanton left soon afterward 
met miss effie on the stairway there
were tears in her eyes and she looked
very pale but real scornful-like and
handsome

  and when did this little quarrel
take place ruth

  u last monday afternoon sir

   last monday afternoon-the day
of the murder hah the professor
could not repress the exclamation of
triumph wliich rose to his lips

  i hope that you are not trying to

iusinuatc that miss effie- cried the

girl suddenly wide awake

   miss effie bless me no why
the idea thank you my girl you
have helped me considerably in my
efforts to clear an innocent man of this
fearful crime llere is the fifteen dol-
lars

  the girl took the money almost un-
willingly despite her previous eager-
ness

   oh what have i done what have
 done  shouldnt have told you any-
thing about it she said beginning to
cry

   hush my girl it will be all right
you have done only your duty dont
cry ytou will get into no trouble

   you wont tell miss effie that  told
you  

   i will not ruth but hush here she
comes now unless i am very much mis-
taken

  effie with her mother was entering
the garden gate professor starling
doffed his hat

   i have been waiting to have a few
words with you miss hilton he said

   certainly professor how careless
of ruth to keep you waiting outside on
the stoop come right up-stairs into
the cozy-room please we shall be
more comfortable there

   my luck is with me the professor
told himself  she probably has her
typewriter in her eozy-room i was
afraid that she might ask me into the
parlor

  professor starlings supposition
proved correct as effie led the way
into her favorite apartment and lit the
gas with her own hand he noticed the
typewriter on the table in the corner

  leisurely and unostentatiously he
walked over to the machine one
glance told him what he wanted to
know it was a double keyboard make

  that one glance told the professor
even more

  on the table beside the typewriter
was an open box of writing-paper-
plain white writing-paper of the same
style as that on which the anonymous
letter was written from the interior
of the box came a faint odor of jockey
club perfume
who and why 

   well professor said effie cor-
dially sinking on the lounge and mo-
tioning him to a comfortable armchair
  very glad to sec yon and hope
that  can he o some service to you
 on can miss hilton replied the
professor slowly rising and taking from
his pocket a typewritten letter you
wrote this anonymous communication to
president cady as one of the faculty
of old orange university i want you
to tell me why you did it

  effies face flushed scarlct

    how do you know that i wrote it 
she said stiffly

  	i have every proof miss hilton is
it necessary to go into that will you
not confess that you wrote it and save
lime and trouble

   well yes replied the girl slowly
 i will confess that i wrote it since
ou put the question so positively
what of it

   why did you write that letter

   because  wanted those cowards
punished for hazing a defenseless fresh-
man

   i dont quite understand

   i should think that my words were
perfectly comprehensible professor i
will explaiu more fully  was at this
window when i saw  the kidnapping
taking place across the campus there at
the left-wing dormitory  detest those
hazing plots they are so cowardly it
is many men against one who has no
show of course  did not then know
who were the parties concerned i
could not recognize them at that dis-
tance and besides the men were
masked

   you knew that it was stanton who
was being kidnapped 

   yes  recognized him but if it
had been any other man my sympathies
would have been with him equally

   but my dear miss hilton if you
could not recognize the faces of these
men how did yon know their names
which were mentioned in your anony-
mous letter

  for a minute the girl hesitated

   that is perfectly simplev she an-
swered   was unable to sleep and
was standing at my bedroom window
several hours later when the men came
home from their expedition i recog-



nized the face of each as he passed the

house

    in the dark asked the professor
dubiously

     i hat street lamp yonder lighted up
their laces with perfect clearness

    oh yes of course and you sent
that anonymous letter because you dis-
approved of hazing

    not at all knowing that the pen-
alty was expulsion i would not have
acted the part of an informer no matter
how much  personally detested the
act replied the girl with eyes flashing
scorn and defiance at the professor

 then why did yon send ihe letter 
because early that morning mv
brother brought the news to me that he
had heard from a freshman that stan-
ton had been murdered then i
deemed it my duty to inform president
cady of what i knew about the matter
 and in that event miss hilton why
is it that you omitted from your letter
the names of two of the participants
 ormsby did not come back with ihe
others i did not see him and did not
know that he was with the party

   well how about the other kidnap-
per robert courtney

  as the professor asked the question
he looked at the girl keenly -her eyes
fell beneath his gaze and again the warm
blood rushed to her face

u professor starling she said  why
do you cross-examine me this way

   did you know that courtney was
among those kidnappers  asked the
professor ignoring her question

  i did

  k then why did you omit his name
from the list  

  the girl raised her eyes and fairlv and
squarely met those of the professor
over her strong handsome face came a
look of quiet determination

   i wanted to shield him-because i
love him she said

  ah said the professor and fum-
bled in his coat pocket for a minute
taking therefrom a little lace handker-
chief with two round holes cut in it

   miss hilton said the professor
very gravely  is not this your handker-
chief  

  the girl took the handkerchief and
examined it carefully


the argosy

   no she answered  i have never
seen it before

chapter xi

two startling surprises-

  when eftie hilton declared that the
handkerchief was not hers her denial
somewhat staggered professor starling

  of course it was hardly to be ex-
pected that the girl would freely admit
that the handkerchief belonged to her
when she must have known what such
an admission would imply

  there was so much earnestness in
ethes manner however when she made
her denial and she had such an air of
telling the truth as well as of being in
ignorance of the significance of the
question that the professor experienced
a sharp pang of disappointment

  if she had stammered out a wild pas-
sionate denial-if she had shown the
slightest evidences of confusion or had
launched into vehement exaggerated
protestations of innocence-he would
have been sure that his chain of evi-
dence had led him aright but the
coolness and sincerity of efries maimer
made him begin to doubt his ground

   either the girl is the cleverest
actress and the most treacherous and
heartless woman i have ever met he
said to himself or  have been mis-
taken in suspecting her in this affair
in that event who was the woman who
did this thing the only answer that
suggests itself is the actress who eflie
says was engaged to marry poor stan-
ton i must learn more about this
actress as soon as possible

he turned to effie a trifle uneasily

   miss hilton he said  would you
forgive me if i asked you rather an im-
pertinent question 

   have not most of your questions
-o far been more or less on the verge of
the impertinent  suggested eflie with
the shadow of a smile on her lips

   i want to ask you about your quar-
rel with young stanton

  effie started from her seat as if she
had been shot

  my quarrel with stanton who
told you of that  she cried white and
trembling

  e never mind who told me i know of
it i know that you quarreled with him
the day he died and that he told yoii
he was going to marry an actress and
left you very angry as a consequence
 you are mistaken sir in that last
respect young stantons plans were of
the utmost indifference to me

   he would have married youthough
if this actress had not intervened to
claim his affections suggested the
professor mercilessly

   you are a little wrong there said
the girl haughtily lie might have
wished to marry me but i should never
have consented to marry him

   why  

   because i did not love him and i
did love-somebody else

   but love apart you would have ob-
tained his uncles fortune by marrying
him lie and you both knew that
yrour words have ceased to be
merely impertinent sit they are down-
right insulting

   i must ask your pardon if they have
become so miss ililton said the pro-
fessor  but i am acting in the interest
of one who is dear to both of us i am
trying to clear bob courtney of this
murder charge and place this crime
where it belongs

   then why do you comc to me  how
can i help you  i wish that i could
professor starling hesitated for a
second and his face turned a trifle paler
then he said firmly looking the girl
straight in the eyes

   because the strongest of evidence
now in my possession shows that this
murder was committed by a woman
because moreover this woman is
known to have used jockey club per-
fume and to have been acquainted with
the undergraduates of old orange
because this woman was the owner of
this lace handkerchief

  the professor stopped for eltie had
risen and stood facing him indignantly

  no need to go on professor she
aid icily  you think that  murdered
poor arthur stanton do you not 

   here was just the suspicion of tears
in her eyes but her voice was firm the
professor felt very uncomfortable this
was a more desperate job than he had
imagined
who and why 



   no he said  not quite that miss
hilton i will admit that i did be-
lieve that you were guilty of this deed
up to the time when  entered this room
to-night now however since you have
denied the ownership of the handker-
chief  am convinced that the murder
was committed either by yourself or
by the actress whom stanton was to
marry

   the actress arthur was to marry
was in london when the murder was
committed did you not know that
replied the girl  she is filling a three-
months engagement at the prince of
wales theater and as she gives a per-
formance every night the lady should
have no difficulty  think in proving
an alibi that leaves me the sole sus-
pect and under the circumstances pro-
fessor you will excuse me if i wish you
a very good night

  the professor found himself ushered
out of the house before he could utter a
word of expostulation

  well well he muttered to him-
self  she certainly is the most pecu-
liar combination of a firebrand and
icicle  have ever come across god
help poor courtney if he should be
saved from the gallows to be married
to her

  the professor as may be guessed was
a confirmed woman-hater and held the
entire sex in dread

  as he walked out of the front door
of the hilton cottage and was proceed-
ing slowly up the road he heard the
sound of footsteps hastening after him
and he knew that they were the steps of
a woman

  he turned quickly half suspecting
that it was effie come to assassinate him
for he stood in considerable fear of the
girl to his great relief he saw that
it was ruth the hiltons servant girl

   oh sir gasped the girl  you did
not tell her did you  

   dont be alarmed i have got you in
no trouble answered the professor

   dont let on that it was i who told
you will you sir  heard all that you
said to her i happened to be standing
outside the door

  seems to be an unfortunate habit
of yours-that listening act remarked
the professor dryly

  i just happened to accidentally

overhear it sir i hope that you dont
think i was deliberately listening at the
keyhole sir protested the girl

   of course i do not answered the
professor in a tone that belied his words
 but why have you followed me now
my girl  there are no keyholes out
here

   because i heard all that you said
and i have made up my mind to tell vou
all

  to tell me all do you know more
than you have already told me come
answer me quickly  

  yes sir i know something that
i had made up my mind to tell to abso-
lutely nobody but i have been thinking
it over these last few minutes and  have
made up my mind that it is my duty
to save poor mr courtney no matter
how much trouble it gets miss effie
into

   quite right my girl tell me
quicklv what is this information you
have so properly determined to give

me  

   simply this sir and i beg you to
keep it secret and not let miss effie or
mr courtney know that i told you on
the sad day that we all learned poor mr
stanton had been murdered last tues-
day it was air courtney visited this
house

   ah   exclaimed professor starling
at what time ruth

  in the morning sir he rang the
bell and i answered his ring he came
to see miss effie but she had gone out
with her mother he asked for permis-
sion to come in and write a note to miss
effie and i asked him into the cozy-
room where miss effie has her desk and
writing materials

   mr courtney went to miss effies
desk and spent several minutes scrib-
bling on several sheets of letter paper
all of which he tore up after writing a
few words on each

   then he changed his mind and came
out to me and said  guess i wont
write her a note after all then he
left saying he was going down to the
police station to see if miss effie and
mrs hilton had gone there to see poor
mr stantons body

   about an hour afterward he came


the argosy

rushing back hot and out of breath he
had evidently been -running hard he
gasped out that he had left hid pen-
knife up-stairs and wanted to get it
i was surprised to see him again and
in such a state of excitement too he
rushed up-stairs to the cozy-room and
 watched him through the keyhole for
he shut the door behind him what do
you think he did sir

  what speak quickly girl said
the professor excitedly

   he ran tight to miss effies desk
stooped to the floor and picked up from
a corner under ihe desk a little flashing
object that looked like the handle of a
dagger with half a blade of glass he
put this quickly into his pocket and
rushed out of the house

   good heavens girl are you sure
of this 

   absolutely positive sir i could
see the handle of the dagger and the
glass blade quite clearly i couldnt
understand at the time why he did it
but since i heard you accuse hiss etfie
 the murder i begin to understand a
little more

   hush girl hush dont breathe a
word of this to any one you are a
good girl though to have told me of it
you are sure that courtney got the
dagger from underneath miss effies
desk  

   positive sir

   and did you ever see the dagger
before that day 

   i never did sir that was the first
and last time i laid eyes on it

   well said the professor  it may
not mean anything or it may mean
much perhaps courtney put the dag-
ger there on his first visit and then
repented of the act and came back for it
afterward

   i am sure he did not sir for i was
watching him all the while he was in the
room the first time

   that time you really were looking
through the keyhole eh ruth sug-
gested the professor

  no i was not sir the door was
ajar i aint the keyhole-spying sort
of a girl i would have you to under-
stand sir

   well well ruth you had better
get back to the house before your ab-

sence is discovered i thank you very
much for what you have told me

    like mr courtney and i aint
going to see him suffer for somebody
else said the girl as she turned away

  the she-devil muttered the pro-
fessor as he continued on his way
 the she-devil so i was right in my
suspicions after all and the handker-
chief did belong to her 

  at this point he met professor
wilson still looking worried and de-
spondent

   starling said the lawyer  i seem
to be always meeting you lately i hope
you are soon going to spring that
startling surprise in the courtney case

   yes sir replied professor star-
ling   will spring part of it now if you
like i know who committed that
murder

 the deuce you sar who was
he

  it wasnt a he at all it was a

she 

   a she why what woman would
have done it  

   wilson arthur stanton was mur-
dered by effie hilton

   miss hilton good heavens man
you are absolutely crazy is this the
grand sensation you promised me

   it is and what i am telling you is
absolutely true dont ask me to ex-
plain any further to-night because i
dont intend to do it perhaps to-
rn orrow  will give you convincing
proofs any way i will do so before
the day of courtneys trial

  starling avas turning to go but the
lawyer seized him roughly by the shoul-
der

  see here starling he said you
dont think for a moment that you are
going to get away like this you
dont seriously mean to charge miss
effie with this foul murder do you 

   i most certainly do so will you
when i tell you all i know come up
to my room to-morrow evening and 
will perhaps be in a position to give you
the entire evidence you will he sur-
prised and convinced when you hear it
old man

   it astounded me when i made the
discovery but there isnt the shade of a
doubt of my being right any jury
who and why 



would convict her on the evidence i
have

 good heavens and you wont
tell me any more to-night

  not to-night wilson i have one
or two little questions to clear up before
i confide my ease to anybody see me
to-morrow night at mv room l hope
to be able to tell you everything then
 well well  said the lawyer to him-
self as he left starling the man
must be crazy to accuse effie hilton of
such a crime but if he should be right
good heavens that would explain
courtneys reticent attitude though
we know that he loves her he may be
forced to maintain silence in order to
shield her i certainly will keep that
appointment with starling to-morrow
night and  wish it was to-morrow night
now starling can generally be de-
pended upon to have a level head
meanwhile the professor of chemistry
was unlocking the door of his bachelor
apartment as he stood there keys in
hand he heard the sound of somebody
ascending the stairs

  the person was approaching with a
heavy tread and presently stood revealed
before the professor in the uniform of a
western union messenger boy

   i have a telegram fpr professor
starling gasped the youngster  is
he here

   yes  am professor starling

   sign this receipt first demanded
the careful boy

  the professor complied with his in-
structions and eagerly tore open the
envelope then uttered a cry of surprise
as he read its contents

  it was a telegram from billy hilton
sent from ossington and it ran

professor starling

       old orange university

  come here at once if possible most ex-
traordinary discovery found stantons uncle
in his room with his brains blown out and
pistol in hand evidently a suicide aston-
ishing circumstances surrounding same dont
fail to come

                                  hilton
         chapter xii

who and why

  phofessor starling took the mid-
night train for ossington and arrived

  in that bustling little town before two

oclock

  he found hilton at the ossington
inn the sophomore was asleep but
had left instructions that he was to be

awakened when the professor arrived

   this is a bad business professor
said hilton as the former entered his
bedroom  a startling surprise i pre-
sume to you as well as to me

  u it most certainly was tell me all
you know i must go and see the body
of course but we can do nothing like
that until morning  presume that the
ossington police have been notified

   oh yes they have left the body
where it was discovered as the coroner
has not yet made an examination the
police say however that there is not
the slightest doubt that the old man
committed suicide you see when i
discovered the body he was lying on
his face on the floor with a gaping hole
in the back of his left ear and a re-
volver clutched tightly in hi hand
how long he had been lying that way
nobody seems to know

   y ou were the first to discover
him  

   yes as soon as i arrived in os-
sington last night i went immediately
to old daniel stantons bachclor apart-
ment he lived there all alone you
know

   with all his wealth he would never
consent to hire a man  when these
hands of mine cant dress me without
the assistance of a male nurse he would
say  ill go to a foundling asylum and
ask for admittance

   well last night  went up to his
apartment on the third floor and
knocked several times there was no
response and when i tried the handle
 found that the door was locked- i
then went down to the basement to
find the janitor and ascertain when mr
stanton was expected to return

    dont know sir was his reply

	havent seen him for several days
 where has he gone my man   i
asked  dont know was the answer
 last i saw of him was last monday
evening when he met me in the hall as i
was coming out and he was going in

    and you havent seen or heard ot
him since i inquired


the argosy

   then suddenly a startling thought
shot through my brain it came to me
almost intuitively for there was no good
reason for it   wonder i said if
mr stanton could have met with foul
play  

     maybe so sir said the man almost
indifferently although  hope not sir
for he was as kind an old gent as ever
wore shoes

     the last you saw of him he was
going up-stairs  said suddenly  then
you never saw him go out again at all

     i did not sir

    then for all you know he may be
up-stairs now perhaps lying dead or
helpless

    he may sir but i hope not the
fellow replied with a coldness and indif-
ference which maddened me

    suppose we go up-stairs and find
out i suggested

   we cant sir replied the man
f the door of the room is locked and
mr stanton sir left strict orders
when he took the apartment that
nobody was to enter the rooms when he
was out he is a regular crank in that
respect not even the cleaning woman
i allowed to go into his rooms when he
is not at home

   well i said  if nobody has been
up to that room since last monday
evening im going to break in that door
for i am afraid something terrible has
happened i am a friend of mr stan-
ton and will assume full responsibility
for what i do

   well after a great deal of argument
the man finally consented though with
great reluctance and i took an ax and
broke in the door

   there i saw the horrifying sight i
have described to you poor old stan-
ton lay dead on the floor with the re-
volver clutched tightly in his hand
there is scarcely a doubt that it was a
case of suicide the door was locked
from the inside and the key in the door

   of course  yelled for help as soon
as i made the discovery and the janitor
went out and called in the police poor
old man no wonder he did not come
to his nephews funeral when we tele-
graphed to him

   on the contrary said the profes-
sor with head bowed in thought  the

  most surprising feature of the case is
that he did not come to his nephews
funeral young stanton was murdered
last monday night his uncle must
have committed suicide since then
why it looks at first sight as if the old
man must have killed himself directly
on receipt of the news of his nephews
deathbut surely he would not have been
as much bound up in young stanton as
all that

   no of course he thought a whole
lot of young stanton but  hardly think
he cared enough to commit suicide be-
cause of his death  know however
that he was very much set on arthur
marrying my sister he was always
talking of it to both stanton and
effie

   did your sister know the old man
well  asked the professor suddenly

    of course she did she was a great
favorite with him but he was so set on
her marrying that he had sworn not to
let either of them have a cent of his
fortune unless they agreed to marry
each other

   and you think that effie intended
to marry stanton if the latter had not
been murdered   asked the professor
taking care not to put too much interest
into the words

   i do think so professor you see

i	am sorry to say effie is a girl who
cares a great deal for the good things
of life and i think that she would not
have let a fortune go begging she had
already refused poor courtney you
know who is a much better fellow than
stanton ever was

   but your sister denied at the inquest
that she intended to marry stanton

   that is something i cannot under-
stand said ililton shaking his head
and wholly unsuspicious of the drift of
the professors questioning  she
must have changed her mind very sud-
denly i think

   i think so too said the professor
snln voce but aloud he merely replied
 well we are straying from the subject
arent we to return to old stantons
suicide the point i should like to de-
termine is exactly when he died of
course there is no way of our telling
that in what condition did you find
the body  
who and why



   well from its condition the police
think that he must have been dead at
least two days

   of course they couldnt tell exactly
but wait a minute  i have an idea if
the old man committed suicide on re-
ceipt of the telegram telling of his
nephew s death that telegram ought to
have been found in the room was it 
 yes i forgot to mention that pro-
fessor every one of the six telegrams
from old orange were in the room but
all unopened the messenger boy had
simply shoved them under the door

   what you dont mean to say that
the old man did not get any of these
telegrams  

   evidently not for there were six
telegrams from old orange unopened
and i understand that was all that were
sent to him when the police slit the
envelopes they found three despatches
from president cady and three from
me

  one of the telegrams from presi-
den cady notified him of his nephews
death and the others urged him to come
to old orange immediately to take
charge of the body mine were of
course couched in a similar strain

   then if he didnt get that first tele-
gram of dr cadys he couldnt have
known about his nephews death so he
certainly did not commit suicide for that
reason

   by jove professor you are
right there i never thought of that
j am afraid i am a failure as a detec-
tive

   and also continued professor
starling  we get an idea from those
telegrams as to when the old man died
the first of the despatches arrived
tuesday morning and he was already
lifeless it seems or the messenger
would not have shoved the message
under the door

   you seem to be right in that respect
also professor what next

   j want you to describe to me the
appearance of the room when you en-
tered it as nearly as you can

   i am afraid that i didnt stop to
examine it very closely all  remem-
ber in that the old mans will was laid
out on the table as though he had placed
ii iluro before committing suicide it

       	a

was a regularly drawn up legal docu-
ment

   was there anything on the table
besides that will  

   i don t think so professor i
can t remember anything else of im-
portance about the room as i say i
am at raid that i am a poor detective
yon see  was so horrified at finding
the body that  did not stop to examine
much else

   there were no signs of a struggle
though were there you ought to re-
member that

    no i think that i should have no-
ticed any signs of that the furniture
was not overturned or anything of that
sort i dont think that there is a
chance in the world of bis death being
due to anything but suicide

  it doesnt look like anything else
but suicide does it well my boy you
get some sleep now and at nine oclock
we ll call on the ossington chief of
police and visit poor old mr stantons
rooms

  the professor left hilton to his slum-
bers but he himself did not take advan-
tage of the few intervening hours for
the purpose of sleep

  he sat on the hotel porch and
pondered and pondered till nine oclock
came around

   now why on earth did the old man
commit suicide  wonder he kept
saying to himself u i wonder if it
could have been because he heard of
young stantons intention to marry the
actress and give up effie it hardly
seems possible that lie would have com-
mitted suicide because of that i won-
der if he really did commit suicide the
police are such blind fools well i
shall have to wait for a few hours and
see for myself

  at nine oclock tiilton freshened by
his morning bath joined him and the
two went in search of the local chief of
police

  this was a man named morton a
thick-set coarse kind of man who was
wont to boast that he had been for
six years on the new york police force

  professor starling introduced himself
to chief morton who sniffed contempt-
uously when he heard of the professors
interest in the case


the argoss

  want to see the body eh he
grunted  all right i ii take you
around there professor but mind you
i dont want any interfering in our work
or trying to teach us our business
theres no doubt about the thing being
a suicide-not a thousandth part of a
doubt

  accompanied by morton the profes-
sor and hilton climbed the stairs of the
bachelor apartment where old stanton
had lived and entered the death cham-
ber

  as hilton had said the police had
allowed the body to remain exactly as
it had been discovered pending the ar-
rival of the coroner

  with hats in hand each of them stood
looking silently at the ghastly figure of
the dead man for a full minute

  the police official stood by in stolid
indifference the other two were some-
what overcome by the terrible sight

  professor starling however despite
his emotion did not fail to take a rapid
inventory of the room with his eyes

   you see professor said the official
almost sarcastically  everything is
perfectly regular and there is no doubt
of suicide here is the gun as we found
it clutched tightly in his hand with his
finger stiffened on the trigger here
is the poor gentlemans will on the table
evidently placed there by him just
before be did the deed so that there
would be no mistake as to where the
propertv was to go evervthing regu-
lar eh

   there are one or two little things
you perhaps may not have noticed
chief morton replied the professor
coldly  i will call them to your atten-
tion because i myself cannot find time
to come here and work up this case and
must leave it to you

    you will notice in the first place in
the grate here the charred ashes of what
was once evidently a sheet of paper on
the table i half of a cigar with the label
on also those two chairs there at the
table are drawn up as if two persons had
put them in that position to enjoy a
chat

   then there is a kid glove on the
floor here which i take the liberty of
picking up and which has a button bear-
ing the stamp of a paris glove-maker

also the telephone receiver over there
is dangling from the hook on the end of
the wire which isnt the proper attitude
for a well-regulated telephone receiver
to assume perhaps you have not no-
ticed some of these little things

   if i have or if i havent what is
the difference mr sherlock holmes
said morton sarcastically   cant see
that they mean anything any of them
 and yet how easily they might mean
something said the professor with a
sarcastic smile almost equal to that of
the policeman  how easy they might
mean for instance that this poor old
man was murdered instead of a suicide

  murdered you are crazy profes-
sor if you will excuse me for saying so
show me what these things have got to
do with a murder theory

   easily that is what  intend to do
chief now in the first place these
chairs placed as they are indicate that
the dead man had a visitor shortly
before he died perhaps only a few min-
utes before he died

   the cigar would lead us to the latter
belief you sec it is half smoked who
smoked it and left it there not the
dead man for i have learned from this
young man here who knew him well
that the deceased never smoked and in
fact had an aversion for tobacco then
how came that cigar in his room am 
getting interesting chief

   pooh  scoffed the police official a
little uneasily  you attach too much
importance to trifles professor thats
the trouble with all theorists but go
on and have your say

    this kid glove picked up off the
floor and with a paris trade-mark on the
button to whom does that belong
 to the dead man you are about to
say for there is the other glove on the
sideboard there with his hat and cane
well you will be wrong there for these
gloves as you will see if you look again
are not mates-they are both for the
left handand probably the buttons show
them to be two different makes yes
look here you see  am right-this one
is a paris make and this one was made
in new york according to the trade-
mark on the button evidently the
man who sat in that chair and smoked
that cigar had placed his gloves near
who and why 

g

those of the professor and in hurrying
out made the mistake of seizing one of
the professors gloves instead of his own
am i right chief

   sounds pretty but how do we know
the dead man didnt make a mistake
earlier in the day and get somebody
elses glove without noticing it 

    that too is possible but it has been
cold weather lately and he would prob-
ably have tried to wear the gloves and
thus have discovered his mistake but
to proceed to our most important clue
of all-that innocent-looking telephone
receiver why is it off the hook 

   fell off suggested the chief of
police impatiently

  fell off eh did you ever hear of
a telephone receiver falling oil its hook
without being pushed chief that
theory is hardly plausible no 
think we should assume rather that it
fell from the deceaseds grasp when he
dropped dead with a pistol shot behind
his left ear

   that may very easily be true pro-
fessor he may have had bad news
over the telephone and shot himself as
a consequence

   yes that is true chief as you
imply he may have heard such bad news
that he threw the telephone receiver
from him and then in despair took out
a revolver and shot himself

   that is a question which we must try
to decide by other clues if you can
find out from central what was the last
call of this wire it may give you con-
siderable help

   i dont suppose that central would
remember that after all this time
growled the chief of police

   well wait a minute see here is
another clue i had almost overlooked
the open telephone book over there

you observe chief that it is opened
about the middle of the book there is
strong probability that that page con-
tains the last number the poor man tried
to call you will see too that the num-
bers on this page are all for old orange
so evidently he was either speaking or
trying to speak to somebody in old
orange just before he died that you
will admit is an important clue cen-
tral at least ought to remember when
old orange was last called  this tele-
phone

   but wait a minute it isnt n  -
sary to ask central at all look there
chief morton on the wooden slab of
the telephone is a little memorandum
pad used for jotting down numbers
with a pencil beside it and see the
old man has noted down the number he
was calling

   we all do it when we are using a
telephone if we have a paper and pencil
handy we look the number up in the
book and then jot it down to have it
before us so that we shant forget it
before we get central that is exactly
what this old man did see here is the
number scrawled on this memorandum
pad- old orange

   lets look down this page for that
number- old orange ah here
it is right against the name of john
d warren lawyer main street old
orange

  and now let us look at the law-
yers name on this will john d war-
ren lawyer there you are

  chief of police morton concluded
the professor triumphantly his face
pale with excitement  that poor old
man there was brutally murdered-shot
from behind by somebody while he
turned his back on the assassin to call
up his lawyer on the telephone

      her first smile

professor jonkins cannibal plant

              by howard r garis

  a triumph of cultivation which threatened a tragedy in mastication

after professor jeptha jonkin
had by skilful grafting and care
succeeded in raising a single tree that
produced at different seasons apples
oranges pineapples figs eoeoanuts and
peaches it might have been supposed
he would rest from his scientific labors
but professor jonkin was not that kind
of a man

  he was continually striving to grow
something new in the plant world so it
was no surprise to bradley adams when
calling on his friend the professor oue
afternoon to find that scientist busy in
his large conservatory

  what are you up to now asked
adams  trying to make a rose-bush
produce violets or a honeysuckle vine
bring forth pumpkins

   neither replied professor jonkin
a little stiffly for he resented adams
p ayful tone  not that either of those
things would be difficult but look at
that

  he pointed to a small plant with
bright glossy green leaves mottled with
r i spots the thing was growing in a
large earthen pot

  it bore three flowers about the size
of morning glories and not unlike that
blossom in shape save near the top
there was a sort of lid similar to the flap
observed on a jack-in-the-pulpit plant

   look down one of those flowers
went on the professor and adams
wondering what was to come did so

  he saw within a small tube lined
with fine hair-like filaments which
seemed to bo in motion and the shaft
or tube went down to the bottom of
the morning-glory-shaped part of the
flower at the lower extremity was a
little clear liquid

   kind of a queer blossom what is
it asked adams

   that said the professor with a
note of pride in his voice  is a speci-
men of the sarraeenia nepenthis
whats that french for sunflower

or latin for sweet pea asked adams
irreverently

   it is latin for pitcher plant re-
sponded the professor drawing himself
up to his full height of five feet three
 one of the most interesting of the
south american flora

   the name fits it pretty well ob-
served adams   sec theres water at
the bottom i suppose this isnt the
pitcher that went to the well too often
 the sarraeenia nepenthis is a most
wonderful plant went on the professor
in his lecture voice not heeding
adams joking remarks  it belongs to
what darwin calls the carnivorous
family of flowers and other varieties of
the same species are the dionaea musci-
pula or venus fly-trap the darling-
tonia the pinguicula and aldrovandra

as well as-

   hold on professor pleaded
adams  ill take the rest on faith
just tell me about this pitcher plant
it seems interesting

  it is interesting said professor
jonkin it cats insects

   eats insects  

   certainly watch

  the professor opened a small wire
cage lying oil a shelf and took from it
several flies these he liberated close to
the queer plant

  the insects buzzed about a few sec-
onds dazed with their sudden liberty

  then they began slowly to circle in
the vicinity of the strange flowers
nearer and nearer the blossoms they
came attracted by some subtle perfume
as well as by a sweet syrup that was on
the edge of the petals put there by
nature for the very purpose of drawing
hapless insects into the trap

  the flies settled down some on the
petals of all three blooms then a
curious thing happened

  the little hair-like filaments in the
tube within the petals suddenly reached
out and wound themselves about the
professor tonkins cannibal plant



insects feeding on the sweet stuff and
which seemed to intoxicate them in
an instant the hies were pulled to the
top of the flower shaft by a contraction
of the hairs and then they went tum-
bling down the tube into the miniature
pond below where they were drowned
after a brief struggle their crawling
back was prevented by spines growing
with points down as the wires in some
rat-traps are fastened

  meanwhile the covcr of the plant
closed down

   why its a regular fly-trap isnt
it remarked adams much surprised

   it is replied the professor  the
plant lives off the insects it captures
it absorbs them digests them and
when it is hungry again catches more

   whered you get such an uncanny
thing asked adams moving away
from the plant as if he feared it might
take a sample bite out of him

   a friend sent it to me from brazil

   but youre not going to keep it i
hope

   i certainly am rejoined professor
j onkin

   maybe youre going to train it to
come to the table and eat like a human
being suggested adams with a laugh
that nettled the professor

   i wouldnt have to train it much to
induce it to be polite snapped back
the owner of the pitcher plant

  and then seeing that his jokes were
not relished adams assumed an interest
he did not feel and listened to a long
dissertation on botany in general and
carnivorous plants in particular

  he would much rather have been eat-
ing some of the queer hybrid fruits the
professor raised lie pleaded an engage-
ment when he saw an opening in the
talk and went away

  it was some months after that before
he saw the professor again the botan-
ist was busy in his conservatory in the
mean time and the gardener he hired to
do rough work noticed that his master
spent much time in that part of the
glass house where the pitcher plant was
growing

  for professor jonkin had become so
much interested in his latest acquisition
that he seemed to think of nothing else
lli plan for increasing strawberries to

the size of peaches was abandoned for a
time as was his pet scheme of raising
apples without any core

  the gardener wondered what there
was about the south american blossoms
to require such close attention

  one day he thought he would find
out and lie started to enter that part of
the conservatory where the pitcher
plant was growing professor jonkin
halted him before he had stepped inside
and sternly bade him never to appear
there again

  as the gardener crestfallen moved
away after a glimpse into the forbidden
region he muttered

   my that plant has certainly grown
and i wonder what the professor was
doing so close to it looked as if he was
feeding the thing

  as the days went by the conduct of
professor jonkin became more and
more curious lie scarcely left the
southern end of the conservatory save
at night when he entered his house to
sleep

  he was a bachelor and had no family
cares to trouble him so he could spend
all his time among his plants but
hitherto he had divided his attention
among his many experiments in the
floral kingdom

  xowt he was always with his myste-
rious pitcher plant lie even had his
meals sent into the green-house

  be you keepin boarders asked
the butcher boy of the gardener one
day pausing on his return to the store
his emptv basket on his arm

  no why

   the professor is orderin so much
meat lately i thought you had com-
pany

   no theres only us two mr adams
used to come to dinner once in a while
but not lately

   then you an the professor must
have big appetites

   what makes you think so 

   the number of beefsteaks you cat
number of beefsteaks why my
lad the professor and i are both vege-
tarians

  whats them

   we neither of us eat a bit of meat
we dont believe its healthy

   then what becomes of the three big


the argos

porterhouse steaks i deliver to the pro-
fessor in the green-house every day  

   porterhouse steaks   questioned
the gardener amazed

  do you feed em to the dog

   we dont keep a dog

  hut the butcher boy questioned no
further for he saw a chum aud hast-
ened off to join him	
 three porterhouse steaks a day 
mused the gardener shaking his head
 i do hope the professor has not ceased
to be a vegetarian yet it looks mighty
suspicions and hes doing it on the sly
too for theres been no meat cooked in
the house of that pm sure

  and the gardener sorely puzzled over
the mystery -went oil shaking his head
more solemnly than before

  he resolved to have a look in the
place the professor guarded so carefully
he tried the door when he was sure his
master was in another part of the con-
servatory but it was locked and no key
the gardener had would unfasten it

  a month after the gardener had
heard of the porterhouse steaks adams
happened to drop in to see liis friend the
professor again

   hes in with the sarracenia nepen-
tliis said the gardener in answer to the
visitors inquiry  but  doubt if he
will let vou enter

  why wont he

   because hes become mighty close-
mouthed of late over that pitchcr
plant

   oh i guess hell see me remarked
adams confidently and he knocked on
the door that shut off the locked section
of the green-house from the main por-
tion

   whos there  called the professor
   adams 

   oh in a more conciliatory tone  
was just wishing youd come along i
have something to show you

  professor tonkin opened the door
and the sight that met adams gaze
startled him

  the only plant in that part of the
conservatory was a single specimen of
the sarracenia nepenthis yet it had
attained such enormous proportions
that at first adams thought he must be
dreaming

   what do you think of that for an

achievement in science awked the
professor proudly

   do you mean to say that is the
small fly-catching plant your friend
sent you from brazil  

   the same

  but-but-

   but how its grown thats what you
want to say isnt it

   it is llow did you do it 

   by dieting the blossoms

  you mean-- 

   i mean feeding them listen i
reasoned that if a small blossom of the
plant would thrive on a few insects by
giving it larger meals i might get a
bigger plant so  made my plans

   first i cut off all but one blossom
so that the strength of the plant would
nourish that alone then i made out
a bill of fare i began feeding it on
chopped beef the plant took to it like
a puppy it seemed to beg for more
from chopped meat i went to small
pieces cut up i could fairly see the
blossom increase in size from that 
went to choice mutton chops and after
a week of them with the plant becom-
ing more gigantic all the while i in-
creased its meals to a porterhouse steak

a day and now-

  the professor paused to contemplate
his botanical work

  well now questioned adams

  now went on the professor
proudly  my pitcher plant takes three
big beefsteaks every day-one for
breakfast one for dinner and one for
supper and see the result

  adams gazed at the immense plant
from a growth about as big as an easter
lily it had increased until the top was
near the roof of the green-house
twenty-five feet above

  about fifteen feet up or ten feet
from the top there branched out a great
flower about eight feet long and three
feet across the bell-shaped mouth
which except for the cap or cover was
not unlike the opening of an immense
morning glory

  the flower was heavy and the stalk
on which it grew was not strong enough
to support it upright so a rude scaf-
folding had been constructed of wood
and boards and on a frame the flowei
was held upright
professor jonkins cannibal plant



  in order to see it to better advantage
and also that he might feed it the pro-
fessor had a ladder by which he could
ascend to a small platform in front of
the bell-shaped mouth of the blossom

   it is time to give my pet its meal
he announced as if he were speaking of
some favorite horse  want to come up
and watch it eat

   no thank you responded adams
 its too uncanny

  the professor took a large steak one
of the three which the butcher boy had
left that day holding it in his liand
he climbed up the ladder and was soon
on the platform in front of the plant

  adams watched him curiously the
professor leaned over to toss the steak
into the yawning mouth of the flower

  suddenly adams saw him totter
throw his arms wildly in the air and
then as if drawn bv some overpowering
force he fell forward lost his balance
and toppled into the maw of the pitcher
plant

  there was a jar to the stalk and blos-
som as the professor fell within he
went head first into the tube or eating
apparatus of the strange plant liis legs
sticking out for an instant kicking
wildly then he disappeared entirely

  adams didnt know whether to laugh
or be alarmed

  he mounted the ladder and stood in
amazement before the result of the
professors work as he looked down
into the depth of the gigantic flower
increased a hundred times in size

  he was aware of a strange sickish-
sweet odor that seemed to steal over his
senses it was lulling him to sleep and
he fought against it then he looked
down and saw that the huge hairs or
filaments with which the tube was lined
were in violent motion

  he could just discern the professors
feet about three feet below the rim of
the lower they were kicking but with
a force growing less every second the
filaments seemed to be winding about
the professors legs holding him in a
deadly embrace

  then the top cover or flap of the
plant closed down suddenly the pro-
fessor was a prisoner inside

  the plant had turned cannibal and
eaten the man who had grown it

  for an instant fear deprived adams
of reason lie did not know what to do
then the awful plight of his friend
brought back his senses

   professor  he shouted u are you
alive can you hear me

   yes came back in faint and
muffled tones  this beast has me all
right

  then followed a series of violent
struggles that shook the plant

    ill get you out wheres an as
ill chop the cursed plant to pieces
cried adams

   dont dout  came in almost
pleading tones from the imprisoned pro-
fessor

   dont what  

   dont hurt my pet 

   your pet  snorted adams angrily
nice kind of a pet you have one
that tries to eat you alive but ive got
to do something if  want to save vou
wheres the ax  

  no no begged the professor
his voice becoming more and more
muffled  ttse chloroform

   use what

  chloroform youll find some in
the closet

  then adams saw what the professors
idea was the plant could be made in-
sensible and the imprisoned man re-
leased with  harm to the blossom

  he raced down the ladder ran to a
closet where he had seen the professors
stock of drugs and chemicals stowed
away on the occasion of former visits
and grabbed a big bottle of chloroform
he caught up a towel and ran back up
the ladder

  not a sign of the professor could be
seen the plant had swallowed him up
but by the motion and swaying of the
liower adams knew his friend was yet
alive

  he was in some doubt as to the suc-
cess ol this method and would rather
have taken an ax and chopped a hole in
the side of the blossom thus releasing
the captive but he decided to obey the
professor

  saturating the towel well with the
chloroform and holding his nose away
from it he pressed the wet cloth over
the top of the blossom where the lid
touched the edge of the bloom


the argosy

  there was a slight opening at one
point and adams poured some of the
chloroform down this he feared lest
the fumes of the anesthetic might over-
power the professor also but he knew
they would soon pass away if this hap-
pened	

  for several minutes he waited anx-
iously would the plan succeed would
the plant be overcome before it had
killed the professor inside

  adams was in a fever of terror
again and again he saturated the towel
with the powerful drug then he had
the satisfaction of seeing the lid of the
pitcher plant relax

  it slowly lifted and fell over to one
side making a good-sized opening the
strong filaments not unlike the arms of
a devil fish adams thought were no
longer in uneasy motion they had re-
leased their grip on the professors legs
and body

  the spines which had pointed down-
ward holding the plants prey now
became limber

  adams leaned over he reached
down grasped the professor by the feet
and being a strong man while his
friend was small and light he pulled
him from the tube of the flower a little
dazed from the fumes of the chloroform
the plant had breathed in lrjit otherwise
not much the worse for his adventure

  he had not reached the water at the

bottom of the tube which fact saved
him from drowning

  u well you certainly had a narrow
squeak observed adams as he helped
the professor down the ladder

    i did admitted the botanist  if
you had not been on hand i dont know
what would have happened  suppose
i would have been eaten alive

   unless you could have cut yourself
out of the side of the flower with your
knife observed adams

  what and killed the plant i
raised with such pains ejaculated the
professor  spoil the largest sarracenia
nepenthis in the world i guess not i
would rather have let it eat me

   i think you ought to call it the
cannibal plant instead of the pitcher
plant suggested adams

   oh no responded the professor
dreamily examining the flower from a
distance to see if any harm had come to
it  but to punish it i will not give it
any supper or breakfast thats what it
gets for being naughty he added as if
the plant were a child

   and i suggest that when you feed it
hereafter said adams  you pass the
beefsteaks in on a pitch-fork you
wont run so much danger then

   thats a good idea ill do it an-
swered the professor heartily

  and he has followed that plan ever
since

the black smudge

by j aubrey tyson

a story of russia in the present setting forth the thrilling experiences of an american who
became entangled in a grand ducal conspiracy

chapter xiii

on t it e ride- t ack

within six hours after his escape
from the krazo and his finding
of lankirk kcnck and peringofle grid-
ley learned more of the wonderful
resources possessed by the men whose
lives were consecrated to the struggle
for russian liberty

 this story began in the may issue of the argosy the three back numbers uill be mailed to any

address on receipt of  cents

   the young engineers determination
to start in pursuit of claire and edith
had excited the forebodings of the two
russian patriots they soon convinced
him of the futility of seeking the aid of
the united states consul

   then just as they had almost made
him despair peringoft suggested a plan
which made the blood leap into the
veins of both grid ley and lankirk
the black smudge



  in accordance with peringoffs sug-
gestion the two americans were to
enlist as privates in a russian regiment
that had been ordered to join the army
of general kuropatkin in manchuria
this regiment known as the twelfth
riazans and commanded by colonel
crieff was to start from rijsk a few
hours ride from moscow on the follow-
ing day

  captain sinoff commanding one of
the companies it was explained was
like hundreds of other military officers
in the russian service an ardent revo-
lutionist

  ci in the twelfth riazans are many
men who are our friends peringoff
had added  these are going to the
far east for the purpose of carrying-
on our propaganda among the troops in
the field in every town you will find
friends with whom we are constantly in
touch sinoff is a tower of strength
without exciting any suspicion he can
summon scores of men to your aid in
any town through which you may pass
trust him as you would trust us tie
will not fail you

  in a few hours gridlev and lankirk
were in rijsk in the province of riazan
there they enlisted in sinoffs company
and on the following morning they were
en route for the far east

  two days later colonel crieff of the
twelfth riazan regiment was in de-
spair the regiment was on two trains
and when it left rijsk it had been
supplied with only one days rations

  for the last sixteen hours the men
had been looking from their car win-
dows with sullen faces-the result of
empty stomachs

  the owners of these sullen faces were
for the most part sons of moujiks and
from the colonels view-point they were
no more than dogs rut famished dogs
may become as dangerous as famished
wolves

  while serving in trans-caucasia the
colonel had seen some of these famished
dogs kill their officers that was
scarcely likely to happen here of course
but the congestion of the railroad ahead
of them and behind them was responsi-
ble for great difficulty in carrying out
certain orders

  the colonel knew that strikes on sev-

eral divisions of the trans-siberian
railroad were imminent that the spirit
ol revolt was stalking through the east-
ern as well as the western provinces and
that despite the rigid censorship re-
ports of risings in st petersburg and
moscow were being received by all
classes of the inhabitants

  i	low had these reports been carried
the government officials shook their
heads proclamations issued by the
revolutionary leaders in st petersburg
had been torn from walls and posts in
public streets as far east as ufa and
orenburg

  and so the government had given
strict orders that commanding officers
should see to it that there should be no
communication between civilians and
soldiers en route for harbin and muk-
den the whipped and disheartened
army in the far east must not know
that the nation which had sent it out
half-clothed half-fed and inadequately
armed was a house divided against
itself

  the trains that were bearing the
twelfth riazan regiment were stalled
with nearly a score of others just west
of kind a little town in the province
of samara that constitutes the junction
of the trans-siberian railroad and the
branch that runs to orenburg

  colonel crieff striding to and fro
beside the cars stroked his beard ner-
vously

   how long is this going to last
captain sinoff he inquired of that
officer who having been on ahead now
approached and saluted  vy e have
been here for two hours is there no
relief in sight 

  none colonel said the other
quietly

   how are the men behaving them-
selves  

   my company is perfectly orderly

   good kelpz had to shoot two of
his young whelps this morning for
trying to desert at samara

  sin off shook his head gravely the
colonel passed on toward the head of the
train the captain looked after his
superior officer thoughtfully for several
moments then walked on slowly in the
opposite direction

  at length he paused beside a ear from


the argosy

the windows of which were thrust half a
dozen frowsy heads

   send kogalonovitch to me- he said
to one of the men who were leaning out

  the head disappeared and a few mo-
ments later a short stocky private with
a broad face climbed down from the car
and saluted

  captain sin off walked to the rear of
the train followed at a respectful dis-
tance bv kogalonovitch hen the two
men were half-way between the last car
of their train and the locomotive of the
train behind them sinoff stopped
glanced around carelessly then said in
a low voice

   tell levaine that his car is side-
tracked just this side of the great kinel
bridge fifteen miles ahead of us we
will overtake it at kinel station tell
him also that he must make no move
without first consulting me

  kogalonovitch saluted and returned
to his car walking forward on the
other side of the train sinoff came upon
lieutenant kratow of his own com-
pany

   well kratow how are the men
standing it  

   splendidly under the circum-
stances when i left them last they
were trying to draw out those two
frenchmen we recruited at zaraise

   theyre a taciturn pair

   so i thought at first but they seem
to be livening up this morning and are
keeping the others in good spirits

  it was dark when the train bearing
the men from riazan got under way
at eight oclock that night it slowed
down in kinel and in kinel it remained
on a side-track for many hours

  from one of the cars occupied by
members of the twelfth riazan two
men descended shortly before midnight
both wore privates overcoats as they
stepped to the ground they were
promptly challenged by a sentry they
gave the password and walked on until
they came to a railway carriage which
having been detached from the train
stood alone on one of the side-tracks

  the shorter of the two riazans ad-
vanced and answered the challenge of
one of the three sentinels who guarded
the car the sentinel called to one of
his comrades who went within in a

few moments he came out of the car
and beckoned to the shorter of the
visitors who quickly ascended the steps
and entered the forward compart-
ment

	  

  tossing restlessly in their berths
claire and edith victims of the most
profound despair sobbed softly prayed
and then told themselves that heaven
was too far from russia to hear their
supplications for relief

  suddenly both started the sound of
voices in the compartment ahead of
them was followed by a brief period of
silence then a vigorous rapping on the
locked door

  both women who were partly
dressed leaped to the floor and looked
at each other with expressions of great
alarm

  there was a pause then the rapping
was repeated

   who is there    asked edith
sharply

   a friend in gods name open
quickly

  the voice of the speaker was new
to them but the words were iu eng-
lish

  throwing a shawl around her shoul-
ders edith brushed aside the warning
hand that claire had placed upon her
arm then she opened the door she
saw the pale face of a stranger-a
stranger who wore a gray military coat
similar to that worn by sviokon he
was of sviokons build but was scarcely
more than thirty years of age his hair
and mustache were dark

   gridlev in the uniform of  a rus-
sian private waits outside said the
stranger quickly  im his foreman-
lankirk you must get into these at
once

  as he spoke he thrust through the
door the overcoat blouse and trousers
which he had worn when he entered
the car

  edith gave a little cry of horror in
a corner she saw something covered by
a quilt from the berth

   never mind that said lankirk
sharply as he followed the direction of
her eyes  this is russia be quick
miss if you want to leave it

   but the princess 
the black smudge

  come come-either one of you
dont stand talking there well return
for the other afterward be quick i
tell you 

  lie closed the door soon afterward
lie rapped again

  for gods sake woman  he called
impatiently

  the next time without rapping ho
flung open the door the princess clad
in the blouse and trousers was strug-
gling with the overcoat which edith held
in her hands

  let me have it lankirk com-
manded between set teeth

  in another moment the princess was
in its folds

   turn up the collar-there 

  he suited the action to the word and
grasping the princess by the arm he
hurrred her through the other compart-
ment

   walk slowly keep erect and dont
speak to any one until gridley gets you
away brace up now go

  he swung open the door and thrust
her out then he closed the door and
after locking it he darted back to edith

   get ready to slip into gridleys uni-
form he said e hell be here in a
minute

  he closed the door as he turned
away from it he drew a white wig over
his head and placed over his ears hooks
that held a white beard to his face

  this done he nervously paced to and
fro then raised the quilt from the still
figure in the corner

   it will do he said as he dropped
the quilt again

  a few moments later there was the
sound of feet on the steps without then
a knock on the door lankirk opened
it

   all right said gridley

  the door was opened wider and the
young millionaire stepped in

  lankirk now completely disguised as
sviokon opened the door again and
stepped out

   sentinel come here he com-
manded calmly

  the sentinel saluted and ran up the
steps when he had entered the com-
partment the door was closed and locked
behind him

   i want you to take a message to the



station-master lankirk said and as he
spoke a paper that he had been holding
in his hand fluttered to the floor with-
out waiting for a request the sentinel
stooped as he rose a blow from a
short loaded stick felled him to the
floor two blows followed in quick suc-
cession

  when he too found a place beside
the body of sviokon beneath the quilt
his uniform and overcoat had been
thrust into the adjoining compartment

  attended by two figures in the attire
of russian privates lankirk still dis-
guised as sviokon left the compart-
ment locked the door behind him and
quickly descended from the railway car-
riage he returned the salutes of the
two sentinels who remained on that side
of the car and walked briskly away
with his companions at his heels one
of the sentinels chuckled as he turned to
the other

   by the soul of the great peter
theyve recruited ivan crasky for the
third section v he said

   nay ivan craskys still inside the
carriage replied the other i was
standing near the steps when they came
down and-

 but he said no more behind
him--

  three hundred persons standing on
the platform of the kinel station were
deafened by the sound of a terrific ex-
plosion four hundred yards down the
railway line there was a blinding flash
of light-then darkness

  hundreds of windows in cars and
stores and dwellings were shattered into
bits there was a shower of frag-
ments of wood and iron and unsightly
things that afterward were identified as
pieces of human flesh

  with cries of alarm more than six
thousand soldiers leaped from their
cars hundreds of others lay limply in
seats and on floors as a result of the
concussion

  bewildered officers shouted orders as
bewildering as their own mental facul-
ties bugles were sounded and there
was a general reaching for rifles and
sabers

  while the excitement was at its
height five persons-three in the uni-
form of privates one in the overcoat and


the argosy

cap of an officer and another in the
dress of a moujik-were plunging
blindly and half-stunned through a
great snowdrift near the railway three
of them soon recovered however and
were supporting the two others when
four moujucs went to their assistance
three sledges were at hand and in a
few minutes the whole party was safe
in a hut well back from the railroad and
out of the town

  a quarter of an hour later captain
sinolf of the twelfth riazans was
standing on the platform of the station
when he was approached by colonel
crieff the commanding officer of the
regiment

  the colonels face was drawn and hag-
gard and there was a look of horror in
his eyes

   my god sinoit it is awful  he ex-
claimed

   in heavens name what does it all
mean   asked the captain

  what does it mean why it
means that right in the midst of eight
thousand russian soldiers count
sviokon and a party of grand duke
casimirs friends have been assassinated
in casimirs private car by revolution-
ists

   revolutionists 

   aye answered the colonel  this
unhappy country affected by our far
eastern reverses has gone mad

  as the agitated colonel hurried on
captain sinoft stroked his long mus-
tache to hide a smile

   it was work well done he mut-
tered

chapter xiv

the right of way

  at six oclock on the morning fol-
lowing the destruction of sviokons car
the einel station-master stood beside
one of the telegraph operators in the
station his face was pale and drawn
and the hand that rested on one of the
shoulders of his subordinate trembled
visibly

  the operator had just repeated to the
master a message that he had received
over the wire from moscow the mes-
sage was as follows

  westbound red cross train leaves
buzuluk at  keep lina clear

  the division mentioned had only a
single track and the station-master was
sorely perplexed lie hesitated for a
few moments before he spoke

   tell him he said  that ten thou-
sand troops for harbin short of rations
which cannot be supplied this side of
buzuluk are waiting here at kinel

  the operator nodded and fingered his
key

  when lie had finished there was a
pause then the receiver began to
click

  the operator spoke the words as they
were sounded

  the red cross train has the right of
way to moscow by order of the czax

   so lie it then the station-master
said

  he opened the door of the telegraph
office and standing on the threshold he
repeated the words to a score of anxious-
faced officers who were assembled out-
side

  there was a discontented murmur
and a shrugging of shoulders then the
group dispersed among the first to go
was captain sinoff

   seventy miles-two hours he
murmured with a chuckle suddenly
liis face grew grave  aye god loves
liberty and these americans are in his
keeping he said

  and as he spoke he made the sign of
the cross upon his breast

  a few minutes afterward the kinel
operator sent to the colonel command-
ing at buzuluk this message

  are nurses needed on the red cross
train that has just left your town

  the answer came

  yes supply four if you can

  the written answer was placed by
colonel crieff in the hands of captain
sinoff

   i only know of the two that i have
mentioned the captain said when he
had read the message

  then he added carelessly by
the vay colonel when we put these
women on id like to ship with them a
the black smudge



couple of queer frenchmen that we re-
cruited a few days before we left they
are in a pretty bad way it seems their
faces arc as yellow as old parchment and
they arc only holding in their stomachs
bv their teeth whether it is the lack
of food or something still more serious
our surgeon cannot say any way they
havent sufficient stamina to stand the
campaign wed better get rid of them
now

   who accepted them  

    did-in an offhand sort of way at
the last moment they seemed to be

likely fellows but-

  the colonel made a gesture of im-
patience

   the devil take them then he said
 all frenchmen lack stamina they
go at things with a rush and then col-
lapse ship them on the train

  captain sinoff produced two blanks
that had been tilled with the names of
the despised frenchmen

   here are the orders sir he said
 we will be well rid of them

  the colonel drew out a fountain pen
from his pocket and with a few exclama-
tions of disgust he signed the necessary
orders then he hurried off

  when the red cross train steamed
into the kinel station claire and edith
clad in the trim gowns and caps of
nurses were escorted to it by captain
sinoff and his lieutenant

  a few moments later two men were
borne aboard  stretchers the skin
of both indicated that they were suffer-
ing from some form of jaundice

  when still with the right of way the
train started on its run to samara the
two new nurses with heavy hearts ad-
dressed themselves to the tasks that
were assigned to them in cars other
than those in which the two frenchmen
lay side by side

  there still was something in the sud-
den illness of the two men that they
could not understand they knew the
cause but were apprehensive concern-
ing the nature of the effects but they
were not alone in their fears as the
red cross train rolled out of the kinel
station a moujik approaching captain
sinoff suddenly seemed to lose his
clumsiness

   what do you think of it captain

he asked cautiously as the captain
slowly stroking his long mustache
looked half-smilingly after the disap-
pearing train

  the captain chuckled

what do i think monsieur
mouji he murmured laughingly

  well im thinking how happy id be
if with two such women with me 
could so easily leave all my troubles be-
hind

  the mavjile shook his head

   ah captain you should have seen
them cat that soap  he said

   dont be alarmed my dear count
the captain answered reassuringly lay-
ing his hand on the arm of the pre-
tended mouji- vou and those amer-
icans did something last night that has
contributed much to advance the cause
of free russia sviokon is dead may
god have mercy on his soul 

   amen murmured the count

  then without so much as a word of
farewell or a handshake they parted

  no tickets or passports were required
of the passengers on the red cross
train five or six times on its way to
moscow it was side-tracked but it was
only for brief periods that its humming
wheels were still

  flowers did not bloom in the gardens
of russia during those rigorous winter
days any more than they bloomed in
the hearts of that dark nations unhappy
people but as the red cross train
passed over steppe and through cities
men removed their caps and bowed their
heads

   they are our brothers who have
come back to us said the mimjiks

   they are the little fathers chil-
dren said the priests as they stood
with upraised crosses

   thev are the sacrifices which we
have laid on the altar of russian despot-
ism said the sons of freedom

  and so in the course of time the
red cross train came to moscow most
of the invalids were distributed among
the city hospitals some however
were pronounced convalescent and were
discharged with passports to their
homes

  the two frenchmen henri levaine
and louis rot in received pa sports to
st petersburg two nurses marie


the argosy

caton and louise barteau went with
them the four had a compartment
to themselves old friends would have
recognized in marie the princess ko-
daleski and in louise her friend edith
wvanforth

  the four had spent several days in
moscow keeping close to their rooms
in a part of the city that was inhabited
by workingmen kenc-k had selected the
apartments and it was through kenck
and peringoff that they obtained their
news from the outside world by
means of the  swallow post they
learned that casimir believed that edith
and claire had perished with sviokon in
the private car which was destroyed at
kinel assured of this they decided
to go to st petersburg and place them-
selves under the protection of the
united states embassy

   after bidding farewell to kenck and
peringoff they boarded a train about
eight oclock on the morning of satur-
day january  the train was an
express which was scheduled to make
only two stops between moscow and the
capital

  these stops were tver and bologoe
the latter being about half-way between
their starting-point and their destina-
tion

  the day was clear and as the four
friends were borne northward in the
swift-moving train their spirits were
almost as unclouded as the skies when
the train slowed down at tver however
the two women watching gridley saw a
grim look come into his face as the door
of the compartment was dung open and
the conductor accompanied by an
mt- nr of the police demanded passports
and tickets

   both were returned and all breathed
easier when the train moved off
however gridley unfolded one of the
passports

   and as he did so he gave utterance
to an exclamation of dismay it was
obliterated by a black smudge

   each of the three other passports was
examined in turn all were smudged

   gridley passed the papers to lankirk
who after glancing at them regarded
hi- friend blankly

  the two men tried the doors they
were locked and even if they had not

been the speed of the train would have
made leaping suicidal

  and so hour after hour the four sat
in silence with haggard faces until the
train finally drew up at the bologoe
station

  the car scarcely had come to a stand-
still when the door was opened by the
conductor gridleys heart sank within
him

  behind the railway official he met the
searching eyes of colonel verbanovof

   tickets and passports demanded
the conductor

  with his eyes still on those of ver-
banovof gridley hesitated then he
passed out the papers

  the conductor took them and handed
the passports to verbanovof the rep-
resentative of the third section with-
out opening them smiled faintly at
gridley and returned the unopened
passports to the conductor who passed
them on to the young millionaire the
door was slammed shut and about two
or three minutes later the train moved
on

  in five hours more they were in st
petersburg

  with beating hearts the four fugi-
tives left the railway carriage the
clothes they wore had been obtained in
moscow kenck who selected them
had been careful to see that the outer
wraps of each were provided with big
collars

  these were now turned up the
little party had no luggage so it did not
pause on its way from the station plat-
form to the street

  two sleighs were quickly found
gridley and edith seated themselves in
one and lankirk and the princess en-
tered the other the drivers were
directed to go to an address in the work-
ingmens quarter that had been given by
kenck

  twenty minutes later they took pos-
session of four neat but plainly fur-
nished rooms in a quiet apartment above
a furniture store

  the night was uneventful despite
kencks assertion that they would be
visited before midnight by one of the
members of his society they had no
callers at about one oclock they
retired
 

the black smudge

    shortly after six oclock in the morn-
 ing all were awakened however by a
 violent thumping on the main door

chapter xv

this  little fatiieus  children

   as the knocking continued gridley
 rose and being already partly dressed
 hurried to the door and opened it

    a man heavily muffled in a fur over-
 coat quickly entered the room

     close the door he said abruptly
 as the visitor rolled down his collar
 gridley recognized worenkenski the
 president of kencks society

   gridley held out his hand and
 worenkenski grasped it perfunctorily

   anything wrong asked gridley
 with a sudden feeling of apprehension

     there is likely to be if you do not
 keep close under cover the other an-
 swered - you have been traced to this
 street and nearly every house for three
 minutes walk on each side of you is
 watched by spies

  on what charge will they attempt
 to arrest us  

  the assassination of sviokon
 gridleys face grew pale

  all of us i  he gasped
 c the four said worenkenski
 tersely

    is it known then  

  only to casimir and verbanovof i
 think the formal charge will not be
 made until after you are in custody
 you were recognized at tver in
 heavens name how did you get past
 bologoe  

 	verbanovof-

 gridley stopped

  our passports were not examined
 there he went on

 worenkenski looked at gridley
 sharply then rolled up his collar again

  do not leave the house or be seen at
 the windows under any circumstances
 he said if all goes well we may ar-
 range to have vour comrade-

  lankirk

  ave thats the man i mean we
 may arrange to have him see some repre-
 sentative of your embassy to-dav you
 must get away to-morrow

worenkenski turned abruptly and



without further ceremony left the
room

  the woman who had admitted them
to the house served the little party with
l light breakfast i fer manner was sul-
len and when gridley attempted to im-
prove her temper by offering a couple
of gold pieces to her she refused them
with a contemptuous gesture

    you are my mans guests not mine
she said  im no servant who is to be
paid with money

  shortly before ten oclock there was
another series of knocks on the door
when gridley opened it he saw a man
in the sunday dress of a workingman
standing in the hall

   a letter for monsieur gridlcv said
the man

  gridley tore open the envelope
within was a letter that read as fol-
lows 

  the bearer will conduct you and your
friend to a place where i am awaiting
you with a representative of your em-
bassy leave the princess and made-
moiselle where they are you will have
passports in time to start to-night

w orestkekshl

  gridley turned to lankirk and gave
him the note the foreman nodded
and in a few moments both men had
slipped on their overcoats said a fewr
encouraging words to the two women
and set off after the messenger

  their conductor led them dowm a
stairway in the rear of the building and
thence through several alleys to a street
that ran at right angles with that in
avhich they had their lodging as they
emerged into this four policemen
suddenly seized them by the arms

  both men turned upon the captors
and fought desperately the street was
crowded and from the throng that
surged toward the struggling men there
suddenly leaped a brawny man in a fur-
lined coat

  they are our brothers quick my
friends-release them 

  the speaker was worenkenski

  in a thrice the policemen were thrown
down and trampled underfoot woren-
kenski caught gridley by the arm

  why did you leave your rooms
he demanded with flashing eyes

  the american thrust into his hands


the argosy

the note that the messenger had given
to him worenkenskis hands trembled
as he read the lines

   the women-the women-back to
the women  he cried  it is a trick of

casimirs 

  followed by a little group of woren-
kenskis friends the three men ran on
with all the speed that was possible in
the crowded street as they came
within sight of the house in which the
party had spent the night they saw a
closed carriage moving away from the
door 

  stop them stop them woren-
kenski cried in russian

  a hundred voices took up the cry
and the crowd started in pursuit

  a few moments later the carriage
turned into the nevski prospect
there the driver encountered an unex-
pected obstacle

  from curb to curb the broad thor-
oughfare was crowded with marching
men-thousands of workers clad in
holiday attire all were orderly but
each face wore an expression of grim de-
termination and from time to time
iee-pieks the ends of clubs and other
rude weapons of self-defense were to be
observed thrust in pockets and coat-
sleeves when indeed they were not
carried openly

  it was in vain that the driver at-
tempted to force his way through the
inarching throng a dozen hands
seized the bridles of his horses and
forced the animals back upon their
haunches

  the sturdy shoulders of worenkenski
and gridley forced a way through the
crowd lankirk was close upon the
heels of his companions

  as the three men drew nearer the
vehicle however their progress was
more difficult fifty feet away from it
the closely packed mass was impene-
trable

  it was in vain that worenkenski de-
manded recognition the howls and
jeers of the persons around the car-
riage smothered his words

  women vied with men in shouting in-
putting epithets to the occupants of the
carriage in a few moments the doors
were a-swing three or four pairs of
arms reached within

  then there was a mighty shout and
persons standing in front of gridley
tried to climb on the shoulders of those
in front of them

  with a hoarse cry of desperation
gridley again began to light his way
forward ahead of him as in a mist he
saw hundreds of heads shoulders and
moving arms and the black top and
sides of the carriage

  inch by inch he moved forward his
hat was gone his coat was torn and the
veins in his head and neck stood out
like cords at length he was within
twenty feet of the vehicle

  through one of the doors a man in a
military uniform was being dragged
for an instant only gridley saw his
face

  it was carboloff the lieutenant he
had seen in the krazo

  the american saw a club fall on the
head of the young officer the crowd in
front of him surged back hoarse yells
-jubilant and vengeful-rose from
those around the victim of the awful
fury of the mob and these were taken
up by the thousands who were now surg-
ing behind him

  then a second man was dragged from
the carriage he wore a gray beard
and was clad in the uniform of an officer
of police

  as he fell forward there came a shout
from an intersecting street and a detail
of police forced its way to where the
wrecked carriage stood the vehicle was
drawn away and the police finding that
they were unable to cope with the angry
marchers gave way

  the tumult subsided and the march-
ers began to move on again the voices
of the leaders began to be heard-voices
giving utterance to frenzied appeals for
order

   brothers would you ruin all 
cried one  would you go to the little
father with blood upon your bands

   the quarrel was of their seeking
cried a workingman at gridleys elbow
 did not the autocrats try to beat down
our women and children under the feet
of their horses  

   why did they drive among us 

   would they pave the streets with
our bodies 

  while these cries were rising around
the black smudge

 him gridley turned and tried to get
 into the street into which the wrecked
 vehicle had been drawn but breathing
 heavily as a result of his exertions and
 almost paralyzed by his apprehension
 concerning the safety of claire and
 edith lie was no more capable of free-
 ing himself from the onward-moving
 human tide than a man would be in an
 attempt to swim against the rush of
 water in the rapids of niagara

  were there women in the car-
 riage   he cried addressing the crowd
 around him

  aye ayef answered one  two
 hussies-hung with silk and diamonds
  ay nay there were no women
 cried another  a russian working-
 man would not harm a woman

  aye there were women said a

 third   saw-

  nay nay there--

 some one began singing the mar-
 seillaise

 silence silence shouted a score
 of voices

  we are workingmen-not revolu-
 tionists  

 silence we are children of the
 little father

 the voices that had taken up the song
 were stilled

 will the little father see us

  yes

 another voice began singing the
 national anthem of russia others took
 up the words

  hurrah for the little father 

  hurrah 

 tlie head of the procession had now
 come into the great semi-circle in front
 of the winter palace before them rose
 the lofty column of alexander  the
 shouts died away and the marchers
 spoke in whispers

  will he come to us 

  yes

  see the soldiers does the little
 father fear his children  

  no no hush 

  what regiments are there

  cossacks

 aye and the jsmailovsky guards
  the pavlovsk and pracobrajensky
 regiments of infantry

  aye aye i see them now

  will they fire on us

      	a

  no we are their brothers but

 ir i pest speaking to an officer

 he holds his crucifix aloft
 lie is a noble man

  aye

  what are they saying

  no man can hear as far as that
 will the little father come to a
 window or ride forth from the neva

 gate  

  the window

  no he will ride out to us

 see the priest and those around
 him are moving forward 

 there was a crash of firearms

  my god 

 heaven help us they are firing
  they are blank cartridges no one

 falls but-

 then came a second volley louder
 than the first

 the priest stood alone with upraised
 crucifix around him lay a score of
 human bodies-some were writhing-
 some were still

 from the assembled thousands rose a
 cry the like of which no man ever heard
 before-a cry similar to that a loving
 wife might utter when felled to the
 floor by the blow of her husband she
 falls with her cherished ideals in the
 dust

  and now ye fools ye have the
 little fathers answer cried a ster-
 torian voice

  little father-little devil 
 trembling with anguish hundreds of
 men raised clenched hands to their eyes
 wailing women with horror-stricken
 countenances threw shawls over their
 heads and turned away

  the cossacks the cossacks 

 a thousand horsemen were spurring
 their steeds toward the mob

  ah heaven save us the little
 father has gone mad 

 the lips that spoke the words were
 closed and numb and bleeding as the
 result of the blow of a powerful fist

 little father exclaimed the
 owner of the hand  let no man call
 him f little father more curse him
 -curse him he is a tyrant 

 there was another volley from the
 regiments of infantry then the cossacks
 were upon them with the blood-lust in
 their eyes


the argosy

  in the sun of that holy sabbath
morning their sabers hashed on high
then they fell and when they were
raised again the blood of unarmed men
and women had robbed them of their
sheen

  back back pressed the mob with
horror-stricken faces ay omen fainted
and sank down to be trampled to death
under the feet of men

   then there rose a cry of  casimir
thousands of voices shouted his
name ice-pieks stones and clubs were
hurled at the heads of the cossacks
whose steeds were trampling down the
human grain that cossack sickles
reaped

  but above the din-the last despair-
ing shrieks of ihe dying the cries of the
wounded and the roar of the fleeing
mob-rose the angry shout

  casimir casimir it is the work
of casimir 

  gridley found refuge in a doorway as
the frenzied mob surged past the cos-
sacks glutted with blood turned back
and as they went the american saw a
priest who with pallid features still
stood before the horrified throng

   in his hand he held a crucifix before
him was the cossack horde returning
with dripping sabers to the vinter
palace of the czar behind him was his
flock

  then the black-robed man bent down
at his feet was lying the bleeding and
mangled form of a little child who felt
no pain

  into the blood of the little one the
priest thrust the crucifix then he
raised it heavenward and said

   again  father of us all look
upon this blood-stained emblem of the
sufferings of thy son and let the
light of tliv mercy shine once more
upon the children of men

   then with the cross still upraised he
turned to the throng behind him and
went on

   like the old herod he whom we
in our blindness have called our little
father has shed the blood of the inno-
cents lie has defiled the image of the
christ-child he has caused those to be
slain who were created in the image of
the virgin henceforth the only father
that russia may call its own is our

 father which is in heaven nicholas
no longer our  little father is the
tyrant of all the russias he can beget
only tyrants that can find no favor in
heavens eyes may his whole reptile
brood be accursed  

  he stopped and pressed to his lips
the blood-stained crucifix

   for several moments all were silent
then a womans voice said

   amen 

   amen   the throng repeated after
her

  amen the little father is no
more 

  from across the nova there came the
sound of rifle volleys the mob began
to murmur

  to casimirs to casimirs

  the murmurs swell to shouts

  to casimirs to casimirs

  and rushing on at the head of the
avengers was gridley

  to casimirs he cried

chapter xvi

the house of casimik

  to casimirs

  gridleys voice was hoarse his head
was bare his coat was torn and his
face had the expression of a fanatical
russian revolutionist

   to casimirs 

   they came to casimirs palace at last
mounted cossacks were on guard-a
score of them-but the onrushing mob
laughed at the bared sabers

  one of the riders aimed a blow at
gridley the american laughed wildly
as he dodged it when he raised his
head the foaming mouth of the steed
brushed his cheek

  in a moment he had thrust his hand
in its nostrils over over with a mighty
grip he turned the horses head the
animal fell on its side

  the toes of heavy hoots were kicking
the head of the entangled cossack
gridley picked up the fallen saber fight-
ing with another member of the mob for
its possession the american kept the
blade

    on on  he cried as he flourished
the weapon over his head

  another cossack aimed a stroke at
the black smudge



him gridley caught it on his saber
then thrust his blade through the body
of the horse the animal went down

  the mob surged over the rider and
the american ran  to where a group
of men were striving to break the lock
of the steel-barred gate to the palace
yard the lock gave way and the mob
rushed in

  on the four sides of the palace the
mob howled and jeered the windows
were shattered by hying missiles and
revolvers began to bark ominously

  the bronze entrance doors were
locked with gridley at its head the
mob mounting on boxes and brawny
shoulders began pouring through the
windows

  as the invaders passed from room to
room the servants tied aghast mirrors
were shattered furniture was broken
and costly pictures and carpets were
slashed by ruthless knives

   casimir casimir where is casi-
mir   was the cry

  room after room on the first floor was
searched closets were opened and the
stairways creaked under the weight of
the advancing throng

   casimir-coward  casimir come
out where is the degenerate son of the
romanoffs  

  all over the second floor of the palace
the searchers spread in a womans
boudoir they found a cigar and a ciga-
rette both were burning

  ki he is here the scent is hot casi-
mir casimir

  a group of vandals tore down a paint-
ing it was a portrait of peter the
great they trampled it under their
feet

  as they passed on gridley paused a
line in the wall just beneath the top of
the frame caught his eyes

  as he passed his finger along the bot-
tom of the frame it touched a lever
he gave this a twist and the frame
moved outward

  below the frame was a mantelpiece
and beneath this stood a chair he
mounted in a moment

  then saber in hand he entered the
opening in the wall turning to the
right he saw a flight of steps at the
top he came to a little attic-room about
ten feet square

 casimir was before him a revolver in
 his hand the weapon snapped in
 another moment the saber had knocked
 it to the lloor and the point of the
 blade was at the grand dukes breast

stop

a woman clothed in black rushed
forward and one of her hands closed
over the blade

 remember 

the speaker was kortese the
tzigane

  you have won she said address-
 ing gridley  but your triumph is my
 own the life of casimir is mine 

 cut by the blade one of the hands of
 the tzigane was bleeding

 with a firm grasp on the grip of the
 weapon gridley lowered the point of
 the saber and hesitated

  you and all your friends are free
 said kortese

 gridley looked once more at casimir

the grand duke nodded

 i have been wrong he said
 leave russia when you will-all of
you

 his face was pale and haggard and as
 he sank down in a chair beside a little
 table he picked up a pen and wrote a
 few lines on a writing-pad that lay be-
 fore him

 while he was thus employed gridley
 took from his pocket a little bag of
 chamois skin and held it toward kor-
 tese

   have not touched a copeck of it
 he said coldly

 the tzigane hesitated then took it
 from his hands

  and you will not permit that mob
 to-

  no said gridley  our accounts
 are balanced now

 as casimir placed a paper in grid leys
 hands there came to their ears a hoarse
 shout from below

gridley rushed down the steps he
found three men staring at theopen
panel

   found the panel and searched the
 chamber he said there is no one
 there

even as he spoke cries of warning
echoed through the house

 the cossacks-the cossacks are
here 


the argosy

  the invaders fled as gridley was
running down the stairs an officer
aimed a revolver at his breast

  gridley held forth the paper he had
received from casimir but which he
had dot read

  the officer scanned each line care-
fully

   pass on he said

	  

  at the house in which he had passed
the preceding night gridley found
lankirk and a note

  the note informed him that when the
carriage had been stopped by the mob
claire and edith had been allowed to
escape they were at the home of
worenkenski and there the two men
found them

  tlie note written by casimir was as
follows

  john gridley edith wyanforth
stephen lankirk and the princess ko-
daleski have placed themselves under my
protection they will leave russia within
the next forty-eight hours any person
who places an obstacle in the way of

their preparations or departure will
make an enemy of

casimir

  note-necessary instructions will be
given to all government officials c

  on the following morning gridley
called on torrell and obtained the nec-
essary passports through torrell he
learned that prince ivodaleskis rela-
tions with certain revolutionists had
been discovered and that compelled to
llee from russia he was awaiting the
arrival of his wife in paris

  that afternoon gridley claire
edith and lankirk left st petersburg
for berlin a week later in the
american church in paris edith in the
presence of lankirk and the prince
and princess kodaleski formally sub-
stituted for wyanforth the surname of
gridley

  as they leaned over the church reg-
ister gridley passed the pen to his
bride and said

   here at least my dear we need
have  fear of finding the black
smudge of casimir

the end

the tale of the truthful unfortunate

 by earle ashley walcott

an up-to-date experience on the arabian nights order and which is submitted minus a moral

the first day of the month having
arrived the caliph ilaroun al
raschid assumed the disguise of a
working journalist and in accordance
with his custom walked abroad to in-
spect the order of the city

  he chose for his escort only the faith-
ful mesrour chief of the eunuchs and
him he equipped in the habit of an artist
bearing a kodak in his hand as a guar-
antee of good faith

  the electric lights were blazing
brightly along the bagdad streets as the
pair set forth from the palace and
joined the throngs that hurried along
on business or pleasure bent

   bismillah  cried the caliph
angrily as he was compelled to make
the running broad jump to avoid being
run down by a trolley car  make a

note of that motorman his head shall
be struck off to-morrow

   i was so overcome by your majestys
peril that his face is but a blur in my
memory faltered mesrour

   what is your kodak for ex-
claimed the caliph  of all the in-
competent character artists in the
palace you are the worst but never
mind your fault can easily be reme-
died have the heads of all the motor-
men in bagdad struck off

  by this time they had reached the
business center of bagdad and the
caliphs ill-humor was dispelled by the
sight of a crowd gathered about some
center of attraction with signs of in-
terested attention that promised an
entertainment exactly to his majestys
liking
the tale op the truthful unfortunate



  the faithful mesrour opened a lane
for his master through the throng and
the caliph then discovered a young man
in evening dress attempting to walk on
his hands while he balanced his feet
gracefully in the air the amateur
acrobat had marked out a small circle
on the asphalt and his immediate pur-
pose appeared to be to accomplish the
feat of walking about it in the inverted
position described without touching his
feet to the ground

  three times the caliph saw the young
man lose his balance before he had com-
pleted the circuit and at each failure
the unsuccessful acrobat gravely rose
as gravely tossed a silver coin into the
crowd and then betook himself once
more to his manumotory progress at
the fourth trial the young man com-
pleted the circuit without touching his
feet to the pavement whereupon he
rose bowed to the spectators with prac-
tised grace and taking up his silk hat
from the center of the circle passed it
about among the crowd with the air of
an imam taking up the collection

  at this end to the performance the
throng hastily dispersed the young
man showed neither surprise nor morti-
fication at this response to his enter-
prise and haroun al raschid forget-
ting the responsibilities of his disguise
threw a purse of sequins into the hat

  the young man halted and with
marks of lively astonishment on his face
took the purse from the hat scrutinized
the coins closely tested one with his
teeth and his doubts satisfied put the
purse in his pocket and the hat on his
head

  as he was turning to walk away the
caliph overcome with curiosity de-
tained him

   pardon me lie said  but may 
ask the reason why a young man of
your appearance and habit should per-
forin so extraordinary an action  

  the young man looked doubtfully at
the caliph for a moment and then with
an exquisite bow replied

   i observe that you are a journalist
nevertheless as you are the first man
to show financial appreciation of my
efforts and have thereby saved me from
the last refuge of despair t do not feel
at liberty to refuse your request i

place myself in the keeping of your dis-
cretion come in here and have one on
me while i tell you the atorv of my
life

  he led the commander of the faith-
ful and mesrour to a neighboring cafe
and when they were seated at the tabe
before the foaming schooners of zern-
zem he began his tale

   you behold before you he said
 the miserable victim of a malignant
genie ruined by the affliction of an in-
tempestivitous veracity

   bismillah  interrupted the caliph
 say that over in arabic

   the curse laid upon me explained
the young man  takes the form of an
irresistible impulse to tell the truth at
the most unseasonable times

   the koran said the caliph se-
verely  teaches us that the truthful
man is blest of allah

   that may very well be admitted
the young man  for we are told that
he blesses also the poor and the sick
yet however grateful the pursuit of
truth may be to allah i have proved
that it is ruinous to the life and for-
tunes of man listen my father was
a merchant of balsora and by a steady
attention to the business of morganeer-
ing amassed a splendid fortune

   for many years the wisdom of
providence denied him a son but in his
old age allah listened to his prayers and
vouchsafed him an heir who he fondly
supposed was to transmit his name and
wealth to future generations but alas
in pursuing his plans for consolidating
all the water-powers of the earth int 
the ownership of one company he had
seized upon one of the cataracts of the
caucasus that had been reserved by the
king of the genii for his own use so
when the festivities that celebrated my
birth were held with all the magnifi-
cence of display for which my father
was noted the king of the genii en
tered the hall and with royal condescen-
sion said

    i will endow your son with a
precious possession he shall be able
to speak nothing but the truth

   my father was overjoyed at this
mark of favor and offered on the spot
to consolidate the properties of the genii
into a single corporation and to under-


the argosy

write the issues of securities for half
the usual commission my father at that
moment remembered the copy-book
mottoes with their high appraisement of
truth and forgot how little of it he used
in his own business

   my father died before he saw the
full effect of the malignity of the king
of the genii yet i am assured that i
made his last years a heavy burden by
my plain speaking upon his course of
life before i reached the age of fifteen

i was left with the largest fortune in
the caliphs dominions and the curse of
the genie on my tongue i am now
twenty-five in ten years i have wasted
those immense accumulations you saw
the last of his sequins ilung among the
unappreciative herd to-night and but
for your bounty i should now be on the
way to the morgue without a coin in my
pocket

  the caliphs curiosity was but
whetted by this summary of the young
mans career and he demanded

   how did your gift of veracity de-
prive vou of the enormous fortune that
your father had provided for you 

    i must speak frankly and trust to
your good nature to keep the most
shocking details out of print replied
the young man

  the caliph bowed at this tribute to
the excellence of his disguise

   we suppress more horrifying de-
tails than we publish he said

  the young man pushed back his
damp hair from his forehead and re-
sumed his tale

  li  make no claim to be wiser or bet-
ter than other young men of fortune
therefore a good share of my fathers
stealings went in tribute to the twin
evils-avine and women but that is a
mere detail my fortune would have
survived the tax for the sparkling
liquors and the hand-ful of jewels that
i flung about me had it not been for my
fatal gift

   my fathers funeral had been but a
few months past when the trustees of
the estate called me into council and ex-
plained that one of the corporations in
which i was the principal stockholder
had proved unprofitable and that it
would be necessary to sell out if it avere
not to prove a total loss

  but who will buy a worthless
property  asked

    oh we will unload it on the pub-
lic replied the trustees  we will pay
a thumping big dividend and drop hints
about a coining consolidation of warring
interests and the lambs on the street
will be breaking their necks to pay a
fancy price for the stock

    but that will be stealing i ob-
jected 

     it ill becomes you to say so said
one of the trustees  it is the way your
honored father may he rest in abra-
hams bosom brought this great fortune
together

     often told my father that i sus-
pected him of being a thief i returned
noav i am sure of it

  the trustees were shocked then
angry and when  said calmly that no-
body but a thief avould make such a
proposition they threw up their hands
and said that they would let the prop-
erty go to ruin  replied that they
might use their judgment about that
i avas merely stating the truth-not at-
tempting to influence their action

   one of the trustees a little later
confirmed my judgment of him by run-
ning aavay to the dominions of the
sultan of cashmere taking wtli him
five millions of my inherited sequins
after that  came into the management
of my oavn business but the genies
gift was fata to every enterprise in
which  embarked

   i told the truth about the corpora-
tions in which  was interested few of
them were able to survive the ordeal i
explained to one of your brethren of
the press those methods of letting con-
tracts to ourselves that make it so
profitable to hold the control of rail-
roads when we own so little of the
stock we were thrown out at the next
stockholders meeting and some other
plunderers were put into our places

   i explained to another of your
fellow-reporters the methods by which
the bagdad city council was induced
to grant us the privileges for running
street railroads without compensation
to the city as a result several of my
friends were sent to jail aud i myself
was indicted it cost me one million
sequins to avoid a trial
tiie tale of the truthful unfortunate



   enough of business those are but
samples of the chain of circumstances
that brought me to betake myself with
my diminished fortune to the study and
practise of the law  purchased a part-
nership in a noted law firm in one
year  had ruined the business

   the genies fatal gift forced me to
tell some of our best clients that they
had no case and they took their busi-
ness to another firm  settled in a day
an estate from which the firm had
drawn a comfortable income for ten
years i told a jury that our wealthiest
client was engaged in an attempt to get
by the chicanery of the law the property
that rightfully belonged to another and
that we hoped they would assist him in
that nefarious scheme j confessed to
the court that there was just as much
law on the other fellows side as on ours
and that we knew he would decide as
his prejudices dictated anyhow

   in fine  offended our clients-even
those i benefited by my plain speaking
- and brought down the wrath of the
judges on our firm by candidly explain-
ing the shams of the law in open court
so we were soon ruined

   i was advised to enter the noble pro-
fession of medicine and did actually be-
gin its study under the patronage of
one of the foremost practitioners of
bagdad but within three months i was
turned out of his office for telling the
richest woman in the city that there
was nothing the matter with her except
her gluttony and that the medicines
she was paying us a thousand sequins
a month to furnish her were no better
than so many bottles of water out of
the tigris the doctor overheard me
andi was thrown down-stairs by his
ethiopian bouncer

   i would have sought refuge in the
church and a life of devotion but the
genies fatal gift was the flaming sword
that barred me from this paradise i
complained before the college that the
imam was not taught to preach the
message of the koran but was required
to expound a faith founded on the in-
terests and prejudices of his congrega-
tion whereat  was summarily expelled
from the school as a heretic

   i was as unfortunate in love as in
business a few years ago i became de-

votedly attached to a young lady she
was something above the average of her
sex in good looks and rather better in
temper than the majority

     hen i tell you that she endured
my plain speaking for above a month
you can believe that she returned my
affection but a trifle parted us

     ou will perhaps remember that a
few years ago fashion decreed that the
young women should wear from five to
ten black patches on their faces this
appealed to me as a highly barbarous
and offensive form of decoration i
told mv affianced that they suggested a
condition of her blood that demanded a
less gluttonous diet and advised a
course of those sarsaparillas that are ad-
vertised so profusely in your enterpris-
ing journal

   she condescended to explain that
the object of these patches was to en-
hance the whiteness and smoothness of
the remaining skin in the eyes of the
beholder by the effect of contrast i
was forced to assure her that the effect
was not only unpleasant but that it was
also a gross form of deceit unworthy of
a modest and truthful woman

   instead of taking my remonstrance
in good part she flew into a passion
declared she was glad she had found me
out for a domineering jealous brute be-
fore it was too late then she flung the
betrothal ring in my face and called
her slaves to throw me out they did
it with so much zeal that i was confined
to my house for many days then 
sought forgetfulness of her in the wine-
shops and in the halls where the mem-
ory of the great pharaoh is revered

   three days ago i discovered that
mv fortune was reduced to a few
sequins and i contemplated putting an
end to a seemingly worthless existence
yet before taking such an important
step it seemed but right to consult the
will of allah if he had work for me
it would be but the act of a poltroon
to desert in the face of difficulties
therefore to discern the will of the
most high i devised the test whose con-
clusion you witnessed and i may even
say assisted

  the young man now fell silent in
contemplation and the caliph eagerly
demanded


the argosy

   describe the test i cannot read
riddles

  the tone was so commanding that the
other hastily continued

   i had never in the course of my life
made a profit on any investment specu-
lation or form of labor whatsoever
therefore i determined that unless
allah should within three days show me
a way in which i might secure a return
from my fellow-man equal at least to
the outlay i should put an end to an
existence whose uselessness was proved

   at this determination some power
of the air put it into my head to at-
tempt a street acrobatic entertainment
i knew nothing about acrobatics there-
fore when i made a mess of an act my
sense of justice demanded that i pay to
the crowd the sum that i regarded as a
satisfactory reward in case i succeeded
therefore at every failure i threw the
spectators a sequin whenever i suc-
cessfully performed an act i passed the
hat

   unhappy man  cried the caliph
 why did you impose on yourself a test
so hopeless

   allah is omnipotent was the reply
 and all tests are alike to him i may
freely confess however that the task
seemed impossible for three evenings
i have performed my feats on this
corner and not a sequin had i received
until vou tossed vour purse into my
hat

   and you have been saved by this
narrow margin   asked the caliph

   the will of allah is manifest said
the young man in the three days i
have spent thirty sequins in this
purse which is the first reward of my
skill or folly i find thirty-one sequins i
take them as a sign that allah has still
sortie work in the world for me to do

   you have indeed been unfortunate
declared the caliph  but better luck
next time

  and giving the signal to mesrour to
keep the young man in sight he re-
turned to the palace

  when haroun al raschid opened his
divan on the following morning the
young man in the evening dress was
brought into his presenne between two
stalwart guards

   for what are you brought hither 
asked the caliph

    know not answered the other
 unless it be that i am to have the
privilege of serving you in your justly
celebrated prisons

   do you not remember me   asked
the caliph sternly  look into my
face

   the reporter- commander of
the faithful gasped the young man
trembling with remembrance of the
penalties for lese majcste into which his
passion for speaking the truth might

 how blevins made good

                     by charles carey

a theatrical tale  an exacting manager an indolent press agent and a wandering juvenile star

blevins had been luxuriating in
what is vulgarly known as a
 snap for three months now his
duties had been limited solely to the
drawing of his salary and to sending an
occasional notice to the sunday papers
announcing that   ring-around-a-
rosy that somewhat different musical
comedy with its phenomenal child
little joseph is still continuing its
record-breaking run at the gaiety

   is this what you call  press-
agenting  a show   demanded hender-
son the manager one day when lie
met blevins leisurely sauntering along
the rialto about the middle of the
afternoon  i havent seen anything
about us in the papers for more than a
coons age

  whats the use retorted blevins
airily   ring-around-a-rosy  is the
big bona fide hit of the season we are
sold out for every performance and the
wednesday afternoon matinee looks like
a bargain-counter rush theres no use
in booming a thing thats already
boomed or as the late w shakespeare
put it good wine needs no bush

   hm mused henderson reflective-
ly  that might be taken to mean that
a good show needs no press agent
not at all not at all hastily in-
terposed blevins  a press agent is as
necessary to a show as a cigarette to
the villain of melodrama one may see
no particular use in either of them
but to try to get along without them
is to put your show or your villain
whichever it may be very promptly on
the blink 

   that may all be admitted the
manager dryly  but it strikes me that
unless the cigarette gives out a few
puffs of smoke once in a while the vil-
lain might as well have a quill tooth-
pick stuck in his mouth however -
impatiently- im in a great hurry just
now and ive got no time to argue the
point with you

   only he added significantly id
advise you to smoke up a bit im not in
the habit of paying the price for egyp-
tians when i get nothing more than
quill toothpicks

   and he means it too solilo-
quized blevins ruefully as the other
turned swiftly away and raced off down
the street  thats the trouble with
henderson hes so blamed strenuous
that he wants every one around him to
work his head off too whether theres
anv use in it or not

   yes -with a sigh of regret for his
vanished hours of ease- i guess it be-
hooves me to get somewhat of a hustle
on myself or i might be looking for an-
other job

  thereafter no one on the staff of
 ring-around-a-rosy  could have
been more indefatigablv industrious
than was the  promoter of publicity
early and late he was at- his desk and
under his flying fingers his typewriter
reeled forth ream after ream of fic-
tion

  at night he tossed upon a sleepless
pillow cudgeling his brains for novel
schemes of advertisement and he clung
to every newspaper man he met with
the tenacity of a stranded poet seeking
to make a touch

   i never worked harder when i had a
dead frost on my hands he confessed
bitterly to a friend than ive had to
to  ballyhoo  this bloomin old suc-
cess

  but the very frenzy with which he
worked wrought exactly the opposite
effect to that which was intended

  wily dramatic editors noting the
zeal with which blevins bombarded
their citadels began to suspect that
there was a method in his madness and
that all was not as prosperous in the
 ring-around-a-rosy  camp as ap-
peared upon the surface

  a whisper commenced to circulate
through the newspaper offices and


the argosy

thence penetrated to the outside world
that the audiences which crowded the
gaiety were largely  paper  and that
very fit tie real money was coming in at
the box-office

  and as this gossip was passed along
it rapidly magnified into a story that
the production was a complete failure
that its backer was about to withdraw
its support and that a speedy collapse
was imminent

  xow if it be true that  half of suc-
cess is the appearance of success no
less is the contrary an undeniable fact
and these rumors and reports soon be-
gan to react upon the business of
 hing-around-a-rosy  in a most de-
pressing fashion

   oh dont lets go to see that pro-
tested the public u they say its on its
last legs so it cant amount to much
lets go to  the kings houpla  in-
stead

  even those who had seen the play
and had formerly been most vociferous
in commending it now turned face and
discovered that it was lacking in inter-
est

   rather pleasing in parts you under-
stand was their revised comment

  but hardly up to the standard of a
broadway production dont you
know  

  henderson unable to account for the
sudden turn of the tide ramped about
the office like a veritable demon of
unrest and kept constantly plodding
blevins up to increased endeavors

   its all your fault he would aver
scowling savagely at the unfortunate
press agent and garnishing his state-
ments with a string of double-jointed ex-
pletives  if you had been attending to
business instead of loafing on me for
three straight months this would never
have happened

    but worst of all blevins was no lon-
ger able to secure the insertion of the
 copy  which he so madly ground out
even the sunday notice was shorn of
the glittering adjectives which had for-
merly passed unchallenged and now ap-
peared merely as a curt announcement
that ring-around-a-ro-v  would
continue at the gaiety for at least an-
other week

    blevins dangled his most fascinating

lures in front of the dramatic editors
he concocted fictions of such verisimili-
tude that even the most doubting of
thomases should have believed but it
was all in vain not a nibble rewarded
his efforts

  at last henderson out of patience
called him sharply to book

   look here said the manager with
withering sarcasm  dont you think it
would be rather nice to have our show
mentioned just once in a while in the
newspapers  have heard that some
press agents occasionally find time from
their other arduous labors to do a little
of that sort of thing and although i
wouldnt for the world encroach on your
valuable time i thought possibly you
too might find leisure to get us up a line
or so

  then cutting loose from persiflage
he launched forth into a flow of invec-
tives which surpassed all previous ef-
forts and left blevins limp and gasping
in his chair

   i dont want to hear any more ex-
cuses he concluded grimly its up
to you and youll make good to-day or
therell be another man behind that
desk to-morrow morning

  of his earnestness there could be no
doubt and when the press agent was
finally able to pull himself together and
review the situation he was obliged to
confess that the prospect could not well
look more desperate

  to be discharged from his present
position as incompetent would give him
a black eye from which he could hardly
hope to recover it meant a long fare-
well to his xew york car eer-at the
best a recourse to the arduous and pre-
carious life upon the road

  yet what could he do he had
pulled every editorial string which lay
to his hand had exercised his inventive
faculties to their full bent and all to
no purpose even while he had plenty of
time at his command

  but now he was abruptly ordered to
score a hit upon the moment and as an
alternative was threatened with imme-
diate dismissal

    why its rank idiocy to attempt it
he protested  i should simply have
my trouble for my pains no i guess
theres only one thing left for me to do
how blevins

and that is to get out before he has the
chance to tin-can me

   accordingly he dipped his pen in the
ink and writing out a formal resigna-
tion proceeded with it at once to hen-
dersons office intending to accompany
its delivery with a few pointed remarks
in return for the insults which had been
heaped upon himself

  the manager however proved to be
out and as he was not expected to re-
turn before two oclock blevins was
compelled to postpone his interview for
a season

   lie decided that he might most profit-
ably put in the time in getting some
lunch and in framing up a few more
stinging retakes to hurl at the enemy

   engrossed therefore in his thoughts
and with his hat jammed over his eves
he strode fiercely along sixth avenue
shouldering his way through the shop-
ping crowds with a fine indifference as to
whom he might jostle in his progress

  but suddenly he was brought to a
halt by an angry voice raised in expostu-
lation

    hi i say there fellow look where
you arc going you nearly pushed me
into the bloom in gutter 

  blevins glanced up quickly to meet
the indignant glare of a monocled eve
and to take in an ensemble of top-hat
frock coat boutonniere fresh ruddy
complexion and long tawny mustache
which inevitably proclaims its possessor
as an englishman

  at the same moment he gave a vio-
lent start for with a flash of instant rec-
ognition he perceived that the other was
no one else but lord balmoral the
wealthy british nobleman then on a
mysterious visit to new yorkand whose
portrait had been appearing in all the
papers for the past week

   beg pardon i am sure he began
hastily  but just then he was interrupted
by a joyful hail of welcome and turning
his eyes in the direction whence it came
was amazed to sec his lordships hand
tightly gripping the collar of  little
joseph the very clever child actor of
 ring- arou n d -a- r osy

  u oh mr blevins cried the boy
tearing himself loose from his captor
and casting himself tumultuously upon
the press agent take me away from

made good	igy

this nasty man hes going to take me
to the pleeee-station and i havent
done a thing except to run away from
the theater and get lost dont iet him
give me to the p leece mr blevins ill
be a good boy after this and never run
away again if youll only save me
the little fellows face was tear-be-
grimed and he was evidently consumed
with a nervous terror at the thought
of being consigned to the clutches of ihe
law but blevins quickly soothed him
promising that no harm should befall
him then he turned to lord balmoral
for an explanation

   ha said the englishman with a
gleam of relief  you know the lad eh
w ell im glad of it i ran into him cry-
ing down here on the street dont you
know and when he told me he was tost
started to take him to a police-station
but the young beggar has been resisting
all the way kicking at my shins until
they are black and blue ill be only
too happy to turn liim over to you
blevins had it just on the tip of his
tongue to thank the other for his kind-
ness and to announce that he would
take the boy back to the theater when
a sudden inspiration seized him

    not so fast he exclaimed fiercely
 thats a very pretty story but it dont
go with me officer he shouted to a
policeman standing over on the corner
and at the same time grabbing the
lordly sleeve in a detaining clutch
 officer come here 

   phwats th matt her   wheezed
patrolman casey propelling himself
into the melee and bringing a crowd iu
his wake  phwats all this disturb-
ance about  

    this man is a kidnapper charged
the press agent raising his voice so that
all could hear i insist that you ar-
rest him for attempting to abduct lit-
tle joseph the famous child star of

	ring-around-a-eosy 

   oh but thats all bally ri dont
you know stuttered lord balmoral
drawing back from the policemans
heavy hand and growing very red in the
face  what do j want with the kid-
die this man is insane why i am
lord balmoral

   it was an unfortunate admission for
casey was just then deeply incensed


the argosy

over the afflictions of some relatives
who had been evicted from this very
lord balmorals estates in ireland

  an so its that erool-h ar-r-ted
spalpeen yez are  he broke in excited-
ly  well thin i dont doubt but that
th lads tale is tlirue at anny rate
well be lettin th captain find out
yezll be cornin along wid me now quiet-
like or with a significant grip on his
club  ill be aither findin out th ray-
siu why

  so for all his protests the indignant
peer was marched away to jail with
blevins still holding little joseph by
the hand chuckling along behind and a
crowd the size of which caused the press
agents heart to swell with exultation
tailing in the rear

  at the station-house the rescuer of
little joseph with one eye on the news-
paper men who had gathered eagerly
around volubly pressed his terrible
charge and insisted on recounting a
story full of lurid details  the impa-
tient sergeant

  the men there were police reporters
and it was hardly to be expected that
they would spot the fake so he felt free
to elaborate and embroider to his hearts
content

  but suddenly when in the full tide
of his narrative his tongue faltered and
his heart sank to his boots for there
sauntering leisurely into the place
came belknap shrewdest and wiliest of
all the dramatic editors

   hello blevins grinned the critic
malevolently  trying to rig up a new
gas-plant for your wilted old balloon
eh i heard about it over at a restau-
rant where i was eating and thought
id drop over and spike your guns just
for fun

   but belknap protested the other
reporters  lord balmoral is the pris-
oner in the case lie would never stand
for being rung in on such a deal unless
there was something behind it

   of course there is something behind
it sneered belknap his noble
lordship is now a member of the the-
atrical profession i happened to learn
only this morning that the purpose of
his mysterious visit over here was to
invest in some american musical com-
edy and i doubt not from these devel-

opments that ring-around-a-rosy i-
the one he has selected in short boys
dont let blevins sell you this is all a
big fraud framed up in hendersons
office

   whats that you say  broke in the
englishman who up to this point had

seemed completely dazed by the swift
progress of events  that  am a
willing party to this outrageous arrest
you dont know what you arc talking
about true i did purchase a musical
comedy to-day but it was  the kings
houpla not that miserable old thing
the  ring-around-a-rosy there-
fore i-

   what   cried belknap springing
excitedly to his feet you own the
houpla then this must be on the
square after ail

  and without waiting for further ex-
planations he dashed oil for a tele-
phone the whole pack of other report-
ers trailing at his heels

  then you want this prisoner held
do you inquired the sergeant gruffly
of blevins

  want him held repeated the
press agent  not in a thousand years
 wouldnt cause him another second of
uneasiness he has saved my life if any
man ever did

  a slow comprehension dawned in the
eyes of lord balmoral lie opened and
shut his mouth uncertainly once or
twice

   then this was really a trick to get
your bloody show mentioned in the
papers   lie questioned

   yes admitted blevins it was i
am sorry to have had to drag your
lordship into it but when ive ex-
plained the circumstances-

   no apologies necessary inter-
rupted balmoral and then as the full
humor of the thing broke on him he
went off into peal after peal of ringing
laughter

  suddenly however lie checked him-
self and looked at blevins with a quick
interest

  by jove he exclaimed you are
just the chap i need for  the kings
houpla would you consider a change
of berth  

   would i  cried blevins rapturous-
ly  you bet i will 
 a plurality of burglars

by edward a moree

a summer nights adventure with a housebreaker who proved to be more than the stuff of

  which dreams are made after all

i opened the wooden door meant to
 protect the house against burglars
with the sort of homesick feeling which
everybody who has spent a night in a
summer-closed town house has ex-
perienced

  really it seemed a pity i had not
hunted up father and stayed with him
at the club but the fever was on me
and  simply had to look up that refer-
ence

  i was a little sore however on the
merry old rabelais for not having been
more decent with his jokes so that i
could have found him without coming
all the way back to town but rabelais
isnt for all men and i was in town and
 intended to do a lot of reading that
night

  as soon as  got into the hall i
lighted the gas the yellow globe over
the lamp made everything look so un-
earthly especially the canvas-covered
furniture that i immediately put it out
and started up-stairs in the dark

  every step gave out a creak that
sounded like a gun explosion in that
closed-up silence and despite the
efforts of a caretaker there was a tomb-
like musty odor pervading the place
which was exceedingly oppressive

  i was in that mental condition a
legacy from our stone age ancestors
when everything is magnified into some-
thing to be afraid of i was very alert
and indeed i had a half-feeling of
which i was very much ashamed that
something was about to happen

   was nearly at the top of the stairs
when l caught sight of the crack under
the library door

  i believe that my heart actually
stopped beating for several seconds
there was a light in the library a
burglar in the house

  something was happening

  i stopped on the stairs to collect my
thoughts and listen

  the silence was worse on my nerves
than tlie trooping of a hundred burglars
through the hall beneath me would have
been i stood it for a while until 
could come to a decision as to what to
do-lor i am a very careful man and
never do even the most trivial things
without giving them a great deal of
thought

  this characteristic was accentuated
now that there was a real emergency be-
fore me i remember trying to think
when i had ever before been confronted
with the problem of catching an actual
burglar

  of course the first thing to do was of
a negative order that wa not to make
a noise i therefore very cairniv and
very deliberately took off my shoes

  then before starting to descend the
stair in search of help i looked to
see if mv burglar was still in the library
the light had disappeared

   nice position this i thought
lt here i am right in the path of a
desperate man bent on escaping he
probably heard me take off my shoes

  but  was not going to run away no
the face of a lace-bedecked ancestor
seemed to stare out from one of the
portraits in the hall and bid me pre-
serve the dignity of a family of fighters

  i crept up one step intent on seeing
the thing through if it should cost me
my life i had no more than moved
than the light in the library flashed out
through the crack again

  still there what luck and then he
certainly had not heard me or he would
not have flashed the light from his
lantern again

  satisfied that the intruder was still in
a capturable situation i made a quiet
descent of the stairs

  you can bet that as soon as i reached
tlie bottom  took the precaution to
arm myself true the armory facilities
of our house were not very extensive


the argosy

nor very efficient in ease of a real
serious emergency

  	 but i thought as i took down that
old revolutionary sword and carelessly
flourished the  horse pistol  these
burglars are usually arrant cowards
and only need ihe show of fight to
frighten them into submission a real
brave burglar would rob a house in
broad daylight where there was some
chance of resistance

  i had started up the stairs again when
mv precautionary instinct stopped me

  what reason had i to think there
were not three or four burglars in that
lighted room why if there were only
two they would make it exceedingly
difficult for me to capture them

  no i never could think of going into
that room alone against a possible mul-
titude of burglars i was not afraid of
one but it would be folly to think of
attacking two or three

   must have police aid still  did not
want to leave the house

  the intruder or intruders-for i had
decided that no one man would be bold
enough to light the gas in a house he
was robbing-might take it into their
heads to depart at any moment and
then i would have my labor for ray
pains

  a happy thought struck me un-
doubtedly if they decided to leave the
house knowing that it was empty they
would come down-stairs and depart by
one of the lower windows

  i had no sooner decided on my plan
than i proceeded to carry it out forth-
with a characteristic of our family and
peculiarly prominent in me

  my idea was to barricade the stairway
simple yes but how beautifully effee-
tive if those men in the library should
come down they would run into that
barricade and probably seriously injure
themselves and be unable to escape be-
fore i arrived with the police

  i took chairs and made a nice topply
pile of them and on the pinnacle of the
heap nearly sis feet high i placed an
exceedingly heavy piano stool

  i was almost sorry for those burglars
when i thought of that stool crashing
down upon their heads but they had
no business in my fathers house at that
time of night

  after carrying out my exceedingly
clever scheme i crept to the door and
cautiously unlocked it

  the street was deserted the cold
flags gave me a little chill coming in
contact with my stocking-clad feet but
i ran rapidly and soon forgot the dis-
comfort at the next corner  looked up
and down for a policeman none was in
sight and  went on

  at the second crossing i came upon
an officer sleepily leaning against a
store door i went up to him and stated
in very calm language just what i
wanted of him

   and phwat the devil do ycz call
thim things ye hov in yer bonds he
inquired in an exceedingly insolent
tone

  it never pays to wake up even a
policeman suddenly for they are liable
to be rather dull of comprehension

  i explained that the sword and horse-
pistol were weapons of offense or de-
fense as occasion might require i
really had not intended to take them
out on the street with me but in my ex-
citement had forgotten to leave them
behind

   but are you not coming to my assist-
ance in capturing these burglars 
demanded of that stupid policeman

   lade on me hearty lade on he
made answer

  and we set forth to the scene of the
battle that was to be

  coming to the stoop  allowed the
policeman to precede me there is no
use running unnecessary danger and
then the officer had a revolver in his
hand which would be much more ef-
fective in ease of an encounter than my
rather antiquated weapons

  when we got into the hallway how-
ever the officer insisted upon my lead-
ing the way

  come on come on i shouted-
for there was really no need of main-
taining silence now-and ran for the
stairs

  there was a terrific crash a splinter-
ing of chair legs and i found myself at
the bottom of a heap of mahogany fur-
niture i had forgotten all about my
barricade yet how beautifully it had
worked

    was a little dazed at first but i felt
a plurality

even in that condition that my plan
would have succeeded the bumps ou
iny head were not painful enough to
take away the pleasure of that realiza-
tion

   i was brought back to the serious
business before me by hearing mut-
tered curses and a violent struggle at
my lelt the burglars must have de-
scended and been stopped by the
policeman

  but upon investigation i found my
reenforcement had simply fallen in with
one of the barricading chairs and was
having a fine time extricating himself
from the tangle of rounds and uphol-
stery

   thots the foinest skame i iver
saw muttered the officer  thims
foxy burglars to cook up a trap of thot
kind

   it was unnecessary to explain to him
then that the plan had been mine so 
suggested that we proceed at once to the
capture

   i had nearly reached the top of the
stairs when my foot came in contact
with something which moved and i
took a sudden drop i was stopped by
the policeman

  and now phwats the matter he
demanded

    i stepped on some shoes i think i
whispered

  the foxy schnakes took off their
shoes did they  

  again  did not tell him the shoes
were mine its very curious how a
person endowed with great reasoning
facilities will do things unconsciously
that are for the best

  now if those burglars had struck
those shoes they would have pitched
head-first into my barricade making t  e
wreck and their consequent inurics
much more serious an explanation of
all this would have been lost on that
policeman and there was serious busi-
ness before us yet

   as i proceeded up the stairs t caught
sight of the light from under the l ibrary
door again and actually felt a thrill of
pleasure that the intruders were still
there and about to be brought promptly
to justice

   theres the light  t whispered
breathlessly

of burglars	

  t stepped down to the policemans
side to point it out whereupon the
gleam promptly disappeared

  i he thing was getting almost un-
canny  was unable to explain the dis-
appearance and reappearance of that
light the only explanation i could
offer was that the intruders had heard
us coming up the stairs and were now
preparing to meet our attack in the
dark

   lut i was not in the least frightened
after getting my breath i persuaded
the policeman that there was really
nothing to fear and clutching my
weapons firmly i followed him up the
stairs

     i iiere it is remarked the officer
in a quiet tone before he had taken
many steps and lo if the glow of light
was not shining from under the library
door again just as i had seeu it when
i first entered the house

  we crept on up the stairs and would
you believe it we had hardly started
when that light went out again then
the whole explanation flashed vividly
upon me

  that seeming putting out and relight-
ing of the lamp in the library was caused
by some one passing before it yes
that was the solution of the mystery

  well i can tell you i did feel proud
over figuring that out

  but my pride did not take away my
desire to see those burglars brought
before the law no i was right on the

     	o

heels of the policeman when he threw
open the door

  the most astonishing thing you
know that room was absolutely empty

  surely no one had had time to get out
of it since i last saw some one standing
before the light not three seconds be-
fore ndthe shutters were closed the
windc v locked and there was no other
means of getting out of the room by
that door into the hall

  a really sensible person does not be-
lieve in ghosts but candidly if i had
ever given them any credence whatever
i would have thought they had been at
work now but on the other hand i
had never before heard of a ghost light-
ing a gas-jet

  no there must be some one in the
house


the argosy

  i was thinking deeply as is my habit
when confronted by anything myste-
rious when  felt a stealthy clutch at
my arm

  sh whispered the policeman
 lies somewhere else 

  of all the absurd declarations  ever
heard that was the worst of course lie
was somewhere else but why had lie
left everything in the library just as it
was tuesday afternoon when  was last
in town the light-well now do you
know that was the first i had thought
of my leaving the gas lighted that after-
noon after i had got through with rabe-
lais

  there was a translation and an old
original worth enough to tempt any
burglar lying on the table no one
can ever tell me again that any one can
have a mind capable of remembering
triiling details  had completely for-
gotten my lighting the gas instead of
taking the trouble to open the shutters
for light

  i did not like to tell the policeman of
my mistake so when he proposed that
we search further for the burglar i
readily assented

  the dining-room was our first objec-
tive point when we entered and lighted
the gas a scene of utmost confusion
presented itself

  the sideboard drawers were pulled
out and everything was in heaps upon
the floor and the silverware was strewn
about the table

  then there had been a burglar

   skeart off laconically remarked
the policeman picking up a bottle of
testing acid

  well to make a long story short we
hunted all over that house but could
find no other trace of the robber
nothing had been stolen and the
burglar had been nowhere excepi in the
dining-room

  this morning  found a partial expla-

nation of the mystery in the newspaper
here it is

confesses many burglaries

tenderioin police make important cap-
ture

  the police of the tenderloin station
arrested a man last night who after
getting the third degree confessed to
having robbed several fifth avenue man-
sions the burglaries at the time of
their commission were great mysteries

  the police believe the man committed
many more than he has confessed to
among the latter was the mysterious
burglary in the flacker home in lower
fifth avenue the man said he was
passing the house bent upon another
job when he saw the door open he en-
tered and had just begun his work when
lie was frightened away by a terrific
crash in the hall he waited a moment
and heard two persons mount tlie stairs
and then fled by the way he had come

it will be remembered that the last case
caused considerable comment at the time

  why yes  might have left the door
open when i went out after the police
i do not remember now but note how
that barricade of mine frightened away
the thief before he had an opportunity
to steal anything

  still with all my hard thought upon
it and with all my analytical ability 
am unable to explain what made that
light disappear

  yes it might-why of course it did
-strange  never thought about that
dont you see  when i took off my
shoes i stepped down one stair and it
seemed as though the light disappeared
and then every time we moved up or
down there on the stairway it would ap-
pear and disappear as the crack under
the library door came in range or out

   knew id think of a solution in time
pm now all ready for my next burglar
for there was one you see after all

joy

joys have three stages hoping having and had

the hands of hope are empty and the heart of having is sad 

for the joy we take in the taking dies and the joy we had is its ghost

now which is the better- the joy unknown or the joy we have elapsed and lost

how i make the
blind see and cure
all eye diseases

without the knife or pain in
patients own home

glasses are thrown away

  cataracts and all other eye diseases which produce
blindness are caused by poor circulation of blood in the
eye the result of eye strain some
time in the past

   it is folly to attempt to restore
the usefulness of the eye by ap-
plying a knife to any of the deli-
cate intricate parts think of
tlie pain suffering blindness and
even death that lias been caused
by the use of the knife on the eye

  i discoveied several years ago a method of restoring
the natural circulation of blood to the eyes which is so
simple that a child can apply it

  when this treatment is applied it immediately removes
all strain ou the nerves and muscles of the eye equaliz-
ing the circulation thereby assisting nature in restoring
the eye to its normal functions

  glasses are eye crutches you have to wear them
because your eyes are crippled

  after a course of my treatment you can discard your
glasses eye crutches just like one can discard other
crutches alter recovering from a broken limb

  my book about eyes sent free tells all about it and
contains pictures of and letters from hundreds who have
been cured

  a postal card will get the book and i will give you my
free advice if you will write me a short description of

strated by actual results that
goat lymph is the scientific
and rational treatment for all

men medical journals and
the daily press after invest-
igation have given it their
unqualified endorsement

  the action of the lymph is
such that the exhausted nerve
cells are physiologically revit-
alized thusgivingnewlifeand
force to the worn-out system
for this reason patients suffering from serious nerve
complications have found prompt and permanent
relief through its use

    our faith in this treatment is unbounded our pur-
  pose is to extend the knowledge of it as widely as pos-
  sible and if you are a sufferer we advise you to send for

the goat lymph magazine

  which will be mailed to you upon request if at the
  same time you will in your own language outline
  your ailment we will be glad to discuss the sub-
  ject with you and advise you as to the results you
  may reasonably expect to obtain from the adminstra-
