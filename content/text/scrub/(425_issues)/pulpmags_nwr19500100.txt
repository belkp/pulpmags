the wolf -woman
of chandindu

        by c hall thompson

north of the circle out on the ice-chokel chandindu morna dark-skinned
seductive daughter of a pelly squaw and a red-headed irishman set her sights
on a stolen pelt-treasure    then watched grimly while three wench-hungry
brutes sought to lay the prize at her feet

captain mackenzie said it
wont be easy

cody didnt answer he stood by
the window his shoulders square and
hard under the whipcord shirt his lean
weather-burnt face didnt change expres-
sion but watching the sprawling main
street of fortymile his eyes frowned the
brassy roll of a pianola in the malemute
saloon sounded far away and sad some-
where a team of huskies yipped and boots
crunched in the snow yukon nightwind
chewed at the cabin-chinking outside the
window a frost-eaten sign creaked peel-


ing letters pale by starlight-alaska-
american fur company
mackenzies voice came again

no gentlemen the job wont be easy
cody turned slowly eyeing the man be-
hind the desk mackenzie had shoe-leather
skin a clipped gray mustache and a clipped
ex-army air cody let his lips smile

  captain you got a talent for under-
statement

the laugh came from
chair by the chimney
tened swinging to the

a battered leather
codys eyes flat-
sound of it dix

brando didnt quit laughing he leaned

northwest romances

back in the chair square-jawed and blond
easy-moving and sure of himself eight
years younger than codys alaska-hard-
ened thirty-three the kind women went
for cody thought the deviling grin glib
lies and hell-for-leather glance even a
sweet kid like beth had been fooled

  brandos pale eyes were mocking the
great cody a  a top troubleshooter-
fretting about the routine of tracking down
pelt-thieves 

  a muscle knotted in codys jaw lets
face facts netting black tucker wont be
routine

  brando lolled back insolently he built
a cigarette and lit it the smoke curled
through his grin captain mackenzie
cleared his throat for a moment on
brando his watery gaze was indulgent
then he straightened formal again
northwest manager of alaska-american

  cody may be right my boy tuckers
no fly-by-night fur pirate mackenzie
frowned used to be one of the best
traders in the territory then we made him
chief factor of the chandindu post i
dont know maybe too much power
turned his head anyway rumors started
nasty rumors

  brando smoked but behind the gray
screen pale eyes had narrowed cody was
quiet waiting

  you heard about the cree mack-
enzie said crawled into town one night
not pretty to look at somebodyd used a
blacksnake and hobnails on him he
talked before he died a wild discon-
nected story about tortured indians and
black tucker furs stolen from the com-
pany and hid in a secret cache

  cody nodded thats why the chan-
dindu turnovers been so light

  for the last two years mackenzie
said tucker told me the seasons were
bad i took his word for it-up to now
the deskchair scraped as the captain rose
his face had a flushed heavy look its
going to stop i want friendly crees not
slaves i want those pirated skins i want
foolproof evidence against tucker

  the office was quiet logs creaked under
the tightening band of northern winter
down the street a whiskey-baritone
chanted several beats behind the rowdy
brass of the pianola cody turned to bran-
do one eyebrow lifted with the smile

  routine chechako

  brandy wasnt laughing burnt birch
sagged a cloud of sparks beat up the
chimney mackenzie cleared his throat

  you have your orders gentlemen its
all yours

  brando unfolded smoothly and stood up
he was tall and broad at the shoulders
he walked easily toward the door cody
didnt move his voice was dead level now

  one more thing captain i could work
better alone

  brando stopped short mackenzie looked
up sharply his bullneck got red brando
said

  glory-hogging cody trying to make
an impression on beth

  the jaw-muscle twitched cody stood
very still the job needs experience cap-
tain not smart hothead tactics we have
to handle it cool without force

  brando curved thin lips no use glory-
boy beth doesnt even know youre ali

  lean fingers clamped on the mackinaw
brandos head jolted back

  mackenzie snapped thats enough i
codys grip relaxed slowly a taut white
line edged his mouth

  sorry sir

  the captains gaze was cold this is
no personal matter gentlemen youll
work together brandos had experience
with other companies hes a man with a
future in a  a

  and the son of your best friend cody
thought  the son of a trapper that died
and made you promise to look out for his
boy all cody said was

  yes sir

  mackenzie nodded thats all gentle-
men you leave at sun-up

  cody turned and walked to the door
brando opened it with a grinning mock-
bow

the night air was sharp and clean
cody took a deep breath forty-
mile rocked with life miners jostled
through the churned mud and snow of the
street the shrill laugh of a dance-dolly
echoed from the malemute an old trail-
chaser squatted on the company porch bot-
tle propped on his belly snoring it off
brando flipped away his cigarette it made
a bright red arc against the night cody
started for the company barracks
the wolf-woman of chandindu	

  brando said this is a big chance the
man that nails tucker might even be the
next factor of chandindu

  cody said theres packing to do you
heard mackenzie sun-up

  yeah a real big chance the sar-
donic grin widened too bad you couldnt
go it alone it might make you a hero
beth might   

  quietly cody said we got a job
brando well follow orders together
sure anyway i dont figure you could
buy beth

  codys shoulders went rigid he took a
step toward brando

  dix ive been waiting for you

  the girl came up the steps running a
little small and well made with dark hair
blowing softly against her shoulders a
warm flush under clear skin her lips
parted with- the smile her hand was light
on brandos arm beth had lived too long
in the frozen wastes of the yukon tending
the old trader that was her father until
his insides rotted with liquor and they
buried him she had been raised with the
tude hard-driving men of the territory and
dix brando was something new to her
she had never known a man who could
talk poetry and dress the gentleman and
make her feel like a fine lady stepping
out of godeys magazine she laughed now
looking up at brando cody had seen
that trusting look more than once in the
eyes of a fawn just before the hunter
fired he started to turn away

  going so soon brando grinned
looking at the girl codys kind of miffed
thought hed have the big deal all to him-
self the captain thought different
cody didnt speak

  come over to beths place brando
said drink a toast to our partnership
beth smiled it was automatic she
wasnt really seeing cody

  her face turned to brando a dan-
gerous job

  brandos arm pressed her close nice
to have a woman worry about you eh
cody the laugh cut deep no call to
fret lady the great codys going along
ill be safe with the great   

  cody said ill be turning in now

  a hand reached out brushing his sleeve
her dark gaze was sincere

  you will take care of dix

  codys chest felt tight he didnt look
at brando he didnt want to see that
smile

  hell make out cody said gently
dix dont need anyones help

  he walked away his boots struck hol-
low sounds from the planks halfway
down he crossed through slush to the
barracks brando and the girl had not
moved they stood close in the porch sha-
dows her face turned up to his cody
didnt look back again

  the barracks was dark and cold he
didnt set fire to the kerosene wick he
sat on the windowsill listening to the
snow-muted rumpus of fortymile some
of the laughter belonged to brando and
beth he got out makings and rolled one
the planes of his face were hard in the
match-flare none of your business cody
a woman does her own choosing be-
sides she could be right sure brando
could be solid under the cheap trimmings

  but when he bedded down sleep wouldnt
come he lay staring at the uneasy dark
once across the street he noticed the yel-
low glare of captain mackenzies window
and brandos tall shadow standing by the
desk

  it didnt make him sleep better

  in the dark before sun-up fortymile
was as close to bed as it ever got the
pianola still tinkled shrill polkas a barfly
wandered out of the malemute got as far
as the hitching post and sat down a
tousled husky stretched and padded around
the company corral there was a smell of
snow in the air and codys dogteam
snapped restlessly at harness cody
worked silently on the leather sledstraps
he did not watch beth

  she stood by the corral post small in
the circle of dix brandos arm he kissed
her she didnt let go he kissed her again
and laughed

  cody straightened pulling up his parka
hood

  whenever youre ready brando

  brando grinned beths hand in his
eager boy always in a hurjy

  cody ignored it north before the chaf-
ing team the street lay white in the paling
darkness beth said

  i dont like it dix this tucker is
in too deep that kind kills when hes
cornered


northwest romances

  easy humor went out of brandos face
it got thoughtful set with a brittle hard-
ness as if he were enjoying the thoughts

  unless you kill first he said

  cody frowned for a second beth drew
away then the mood passed brandos
arm tightened on her waist

  i told you lady quit fretting after
all with the great  

  cody looked at him levelly

  beth said you wont forget cody

  forget brando laughed he loves
me didnt you know he loves us both

beth flushed cody turned back to
the sled his eyes were flat on the
bleak reach of windswept tundras beyond
the town he hove against the gee-pole
the runners rocked free

  pretty near sun-up he said and threw
a sharp haw at the team brando fell
into stride by the lead-dog as the lines
hauled taut the sled lurched forward
cut down the long empty street the
pianola had gone dead there was no
sound but the bright yelp of huskies and
brandos shouted aiee mush cody
could see the girl small and alone in the
growing light she was still waving but
not to him

  they struck north a short leg along
the yukon through silvered spruce groves
and the cold shadows of sheer ice-hills
brando moved steadily cursing the dogs
his face wasnt easy and laughing any-
more his eyes were harsh narrowed
daylight went too quickly handling the
pole cody didnt talk he kept thinking
of brandos eyes hearing words in the
biting rush of wind unless you kill first
unless you kill   

  he told himself lie was crazy letting
his feelings for beth overrun common
sense mackenzie was nobodys fool come
time brando would handle tucker and
the indians in the right way hed keep
his fist away from the colt thonged to
his thigh cody tried to believe it the
accident didnt help

  the sun was going a wolf loped to
the crest of a distant tundra and squatted
panting watching them the birch sled
swung right at the crotch in the yukon
and pitched northeast on the treacherous
rimreck of chandindu river rounding
a sharp bend the sled-dog lost footing

and slithered over the edge the runners
listed crazily and cody lunged back
against the geepole for counterbalance the
sled teetered settled upright

  brandos mukluks made a driving angry
grind in the snow the muscles of his
jaw had that set white look and he had
freed the rawhide whip from his belt
cody said listen    the wet tongue
lashed out slicing across the sled-dogs
muzzle the husky yelped and bristled
brandos lips pulled back from clenched
teeth the thong swung wide for another
blow cody caught the wrist

  easy mister

  we got time to make no dumb bitch
is going to bog us

  codys grip tightened the whiphand
lost color

  in a toneless voice cody said thats
not tucker youre beating

  wind brushed south over the ice-choked
chandindu brando stood very still then
his eyes veiled he had control of him-
self without a word he twisted away
cody took the lead after that brando
didnt argue they had no more trouble on
the rimrock but in gathering twilight
cody felt the pale eyes on him watching
thinking

  they pitched camp at the foot of a steep
hill dotted with a stand of aspens it was
too quiet somewhere on the tundras a
wolf worried the moon the fire was feeble
and sank low in melted ice cody dished
up the grub the bean-mash had no taste
and the tea was bitter brando didnt
eat he sat silent now smoking easy and
sure again the boy with the clever smile
finally cody set down his tin plate

all right he said lets settle it
brando let out a smoke-cloud damp
kindling sputtered in the fire cody said
that talk about killing tucker forget
it

  so you give the orders now

  well skip the humor brando well
forget beth thats our score but this
job is company business we take it slow
and easy we get evidence we find out
where tucker cached the contraband and
how he figures to get it out of the terri-
tory then the law gets him

  all nice and neat brando said only
maybe i got other ways of settling tucker
for good he rose slowly facing cody
the wolf-woman of chandindu



of course my way takes guts

  cody went ramrod stiff one hand
caught brandos shirtfront brando threw
the right low under the belt cody dou-
bled and a driving knee met his jaw half-
way he wheeled back jarring against
the sled the dogs roused snapping cody
shook his head to clear it his eyes were
cold expressionless brando closed in
codys mukluks dug deep bracing for the
charge it didnt come

  halfway between them a sudden geyser
of snow spouted up a split-second later
the hammer and whine of a - echoed
high in the aspen grove cody went belly-
flat in the sled shadows for a moment
brando stood numb outlined against the
fire down cody snapped and in the
trees an orange flame-needle darted ice
splintered near brandos foot he swore
sprawling in the snow not far from cody
he was breathing hard his lips looked
bloodless cody smiled thinly

  you wanted it the hard way baby
here it is

  bright boy brando growled

  a minute passed the gun in the hills
waited the wind soughed still lying flat
cody slid the winchester from its sled-
strapped boot his eyes swung past a roll-
ing snow-hummock to a nest of jagged
boulders ten yards beyond the firelit camp
circle

  im going over there he said the
risell cover me keep him busy with your
colt when i get there quit firing
but  

quit firing cody said whoevers
up there hell get curious and head down
he knows something we want him alive
brando frowned drawing the colt
get that cody told him alive
brando nodded

the going was slow the hummock
was shallow poor protection but be-
yond the fire darkness helped cody
crawled flat against the ice holding the
winchester clear brando opened fire the
colt slugs fluttered and ricocheted and
in the aspen stand a heavy roar answered
codys hand was numb on the rifle an
iceridge dug at his face he kept going
he made it the colt let go a final shot
the - flashed and echoes died slowly
then there was no sound at all

  cody hunched in the lee of a tall boul-
der his gaze flicked to brando if that
gun-happy chechako moved too soon but
nothing stirred by the sled the hillgrove
was different a small slide of shale and
muddy ice trickled downgrade codys fist
hugged the rifle the trigger was cold
under his finger the footsteps came down
slowly wary the quick light tread of moc-
casins the man was wearing a parka the
- was ready in the crotch of his arm
firelight picked out the flat blank planes
of an indian face hard black eyes probed
the clearing the indian took a stride
toward the sled cody stood up and lev-
elled the winchester

  dont turn around

  the indian didnt only his arms moved
slowly swinging out and up cody moved
in the chatter of his mukluks sounded
loud he stopped with the riflle muzzle
nudging the mans spine the indian let
go of the -

  cody said all right brando

  the figure by the sled stirred brandos
lips were drawn back as he bent for the
rifle his eyes glittered he clubbed the
- and wheeled for the indian
easy cody snapped

  brando stopped the blow midway but
his mouth stayed crooked

  facing him now cody reached out and
slid the skinning-knife from the indians
belt the indian stood quite still nothing
at all in his level stare but when he
breathed a strong smell carried on the
night air-the stink of white-mans rotgut

  in english cody said youre a cree
from chandindu post

  the black eyes slitted no savvy
  youre a cree tucker sent you

  the brave took a step back automati-
cally his hand went to the empty knife-
sheath all he said was no savvy
lying sonofa    the lunge was ani-
mal-quick like the flare of brandos eyes
the colt-barrel raked down in a vicious
arc the indian staggered to one side
cody stepped between them his voice was
flat final

  the crees are friendly they can help
us

  friendly brando grated yellow
rats that snipe at you from ambush but
he didnt go near the indian again

  cody turned the cree was on his feet


northwest romances

a long rib of broken flesh oozed slow
drops of blood that drained down the set
mahogany jaw there was something lost
and beaten in the blank gaze

  gently cody said you can talk to us
the indian stared cody switched to
cree dialect

  it would be better for your people
if there were no tucker many sleeps ago
a man came to your outpost and goodness
went out of your lives because he brought
hate and fear he fed your braves whiskey
to rot their minds and used a bullwhip
on your squaws pie worked you until
you dropped and stole most of the fruit
of your traps for his own gain

  for a moment the crees face was not
so empty cody said we can rid you of
tucker your children can laugh and be
strong again if you will swear that this
man cheats you if you will say how he
hides and sells the peltries that belong
to you and the company   

  the indians mouth worked then hope
shadowed away the cree shrugged

  it is not easy to forget fear it is not
easy to risk a squaw and two sons when
you have seen a woman cut to ribbons be-
cause she did not obey you remember
you obey

  talk brando rasped let me handle
this yellow   

  codys glance shut him up

  there would be a new factor at your
post cody told the indian you would
have to fear no man

  maybe the black gaze twitched toward
the tall dark reaches of the aspen stand
the crees tongue was thick

  it is not only a man we have to
fear

  the words splintered onf a sharp cry
the crees eyes went wide and he stumbled
as the whine of a rifle whipped down
from the grove he swayed  his legs bellied
and blood came from his mouth and nose
he crumpled

  swearing hoarsely cody spun levering
the winchester firing blind into high
blackness echoes rebounded the other
gun didnt bite back through his teeth
cody said take care of the indian
and started up the steep grade he ran
in a low crouch drifts dragged at his tnuk-
luk he waited for a yellow spurt of
fire from the ambush it didnt come the

climb was rugged rocks scraped at his
clawing hands branches reached down
and slapped across his face he found the
spot

  moonlight etched the long print of a
body where the cree had sprawled and
drawn bead the chopping hoofmarks of
two ponies beat off down the north side
of the hill jumbled here with the deep
wide scars of the indians tread then
cody whistled softly and went to one
knee another set of prints fanned out
near brush where the horses had been
tethered-the prints of small feet in dainty
moccasins cody stood erect frowning
half aloud he said not only a man   
abruptly he headed downhill the indian
had talked but not enough the talk had
shied clear of something some special
detail tied in with tucker and a kings
ransom in pirated pelts half running he
reached the campsite and stopped

  brando stood by the fire building a cig-
arette slowly he lit it with a burning
twig the smoke looked white in moon-
light cody did not notice he watched
the cree the ragdoll figure lying face-up
now its eyes open and glazed the blood
making dark frozen stains in the jaw-
stubble a small wind brushed snow from
the tundras flakes settled on the indians
eyes they did not blink brando smoked
cody said he didnt say anymore
he was dead when he hit ground
the pale angry gaze switched to the as-
pens nothing up there

  cody stared at the indians frozen secret
face pony tracks heading north
brando stiffened maybe if we trailed
them  

  at night with a team of beat-out
malemutes 

  they wouldnt have a chance they both
knew it

  cody sounded tired bitter we better
dig a grave

  brando stood there gradually the old
mocking grin returned dont beat the
poor indian dix use kid gloves on him
let him stall wait till hes dead-then
ask questions

  shut up cody said

  the smile warped maybe youll let
me handle things next time

  cody went to the sled he shouldered
the pick and dug the spade into snow near
the wolf-woman of chandindu



brandos feet

  we better dig a grave

  they burnt a pit through the crusted
snow and broke the rockhard earth be-
neath it took time neither of them talked
a pack of gray wolves came down to the
edge of the hillgrove and sat panting yel-
low eyes shining noses twitching to the
smell of death brando swore and took a
shot at them they scattered minutes later
they were back waiting

  the two men bedded down cody slept
badly there was a dead indian face in
his sleep a dead mouth that whispered
moccasins not only a man more than
a man to fear dainty moccasins cody
started awake there was cold sweat on
the fist that reached out for the winches-
ter the camp was empty still maybe he
had dreamed the soft grind of footsteps
in the snow but he couldnt get shut of
the notion that they were watched by
more than wolves he did not sleep again
he lay there wondering

the chandindu layout was a
poor excuse for an outpost the
skinlodges were mangy and neglected the
untended fires were scanty squaws and
children with the swollen bellies of
hunger stood silent under the tent
flies their faces flat and beyond feeling
only the black eyes narrowed following
cody and brando as they tooled the sled
into the compound cree braves came
slowly from the lodges rifles and skin-
ning-knives close to hand their faces
were feverish with whiskey and blank sur-
prise as if they watched dead men walking
by brando flicked cody an uneasy glance

  i dont like it

  easy does it cody kept walking
sled runners creaked loudly in the late
afternoon quiet the outfit headed past
ragged tents toward the long low square
of the headquarters cabin they didnt
get far

  a tall bony-ribbed cree with the gold-
ore amulet of a chief hanging from one
earlobe made a swift sign nooselike the
indians closed in on the sled the lead
dog reared back white fangs bared hack-
les bristling cody gentled it the cree
chief was close now breathing whiskey
his hand tight on the knifehilt sun winked
on the razoredged blade brando squared

off and his right swung low to the colt
quietly cody said no guns brando
waited the indians halted cody looked
at the chief

  we come to see tucker

  a rough mutter ran through the crowd
it bellied back at the name but the chief
came on slow deliberate the knifehand
lifting

  enough tantlak

  the cree froze moccasined feet set
for the spring something like panic
stirred behind the dark rum-fuzzed eyes
the wasted face went shapeless he
stepped back from cody and turned the
bucks made a low trapped sound an aisle
opened in the noose cody and brando
watched the white man advance

  black tucker wasnt tall but built
across with more than two hundred
pounds of sinewed meat sheathing hard
heavy bonework thick arms and shoul-
ders strained against the plaid mackinaw
his face was wide with eyes like frosted
steel and seams of jowlfat hidden by a
clipped blond beard teeth showed very
white in a broad smile hobnail boots made
a strong grating in the packed snow

  he looked at cody and brando weighty
wheezing faintly with movement he
turned to the chief the pleasant smile
stayed put tantlak took another back-
ward step an old squaw stiflled a scream
as tuckers haunch-like fist flung out
cody caught the glint of brass knuckles
the chief lurched and sprawled crazily
casual deliberate tucker drew back the
left boot the hobnails got tantlak just
over the temple he flattened without a
groan

  tucker smiled eyeing brandos fist
white-knuckled on the gunbutt

  i reckon you wont need that mr

  brando relaxed slowly finally his lips
bent brando he said

the broad face nodded genially swing-
ing to cody mr brando and   
cody told him tucker nodded again
just so ive been looking forward to
your visit

  the big hand reached out cody ig-
nored it the watching crees murmured
uneasily tuckers smile got strained he
swung to the indians jabbed a finger at
tantlak get him out of here

  the bucks did not move the deep voice
	northwest romances

went harsh

  i said take him away

  reluctantly two braves obeyed sup-
porting tantlak by the armpits they
dragged him off to a distant lodge cody
watched his mouth set and thin tucker
had the grin back in place

  youll overlook the little rukus friends
you cant trust these heathen devils for
a minute

  did you ever try cody said

  tucker laughed as if it were a fine joke
but his eyes didnt laugh with the rest
of him

  youve had a hard trek friends youll
want a drink theres a good fire in the
office

  he led the way the sun lay very bright
across the compound but there was no
warmth in it the crees stood quite still
watching as cody and brando followed
there was blood on the snow where their
chief had fallen

  the company office was dim and hot
with a smell of stale food and tanned hides
a hangdown kerosene lamp swayed idly
above the rough-hewn table the moth of
flame danced high and dwindled with the
closing of the door casting dwarf-shadows
on the mudchinked walls the floorplanks
groaned under tuckers rolling stride he
brought a jug and tin cups to the table
wheezing smiling

  grade a rum straight from dawson
nothing like a cup of cheer among friends

  he stopped his eyes showed a flicker of
annoyance cody saw why

  brando had already spotted the girl
she stood on the right in a bead-cur-
tained doorway that led through a hall
to another cabin by lamplight her skin
had a deep copper glow that blended with
the mahogany red of thick soft hair a
full body pressed against the cotton blouse
and fringed buckskin skirt and there was
a taunting promise in dark eyes and red
parted lips she walked with the native
grace of a deer her dainty quilled mocca-
sins made little sound those eyes smiled
at brando

  it is not often we have distinguished
guests

  her voice was warm like the searching
touch of a hand cody glanced at brando
smiling brando eyed the girl easy and
speculating he wasnt thinking of beth

  its not often you find a beautiful wo-
man north of the circle

  tucker scowled then covered with a
gravelly laugh his tone had a sarcastic
edge gentlemen my faithful wife mor-
na my little halfbreed minx

  the girl finished pouring the drinks
and offered a cup to brando their fin-
gers brushed cody took his cup he didnt
drink

  brando said to the minx

  morna laughed black tucker didnt
he downed the whiskey neat his fat
arm circled morna blunt fingers dug into
the flesh of her shoulder she let him kiss
her cody saw brandos lips tighten

  a rare flower gentlemen tucker
grunted into the rustic chair by the table
her father was one of the first trappers
to push into the barrens big red-headed
irishman that took a pelly squaw to his
bed and board the mother died in the
plague the irishman went chasing a rain-
bow gold pot never came back and poor
little morna was all alone the wheeze
was meant for laughter it wasnt pleasant
but even before we married she could
hold her own oh yes little morna will
always hold her own

the lamp idled gently outside
wind brushed against the walls the
silence got awkward morna tasted her
drink watching brando over the cuprim
she went and sat on the quilt-covered sofa
by the fire stretching like a contented
animal her legs round and firm under the
buckskin skirt

  tucker refilled his cup getting back to
business was an effort he frowned the
worry looked real

  i warned the home office mr cody
heard they were sending you up and
figured on trouble these crees hate the
white mans guts no telling what they
might try on strange chechakos took
me over a year to get them to heel
with hobnails and rotgut cody said
tonelessly

  tucker did not blink the girl stopped
sipping whiskey the lamp swayed then
that imitation wheeze-laugh shook the
massive chest

  indians all they understand is the
whip and the boot the grin jelled i
been here a long spell mr cody i run
the wolf woman of chandindu



my bost the way i see fit

 cody said the company wants
friendly crees not brow-beaten enemies
thick jowls reddened blunt fingers
closed hard the cup nearly bent under
the pressure if i hadnt beat tantlak
youd have a slit belly

  cody ignored the quick glance between
brando and the girl

  youre discouraging he said so was
the ambush

  anger had drained out of tuckers face
his mouth hung open wet and surprised
give him one thing cody thought he
knows his act carefully moma set down
the tin cup pier eyes were on cody now
no longer smiling or coquettish

  they tried to bushwhack you tucker
said started already these sneaking
crees the chair rasped as he rose ill
get to the bottom of this ill whip the
hide off the one that  

  no use whipping a dead man cody
said

  tucker halted halfway to the door
steel-gray eyes flicked to the girl she
turned away some of the warm color
had left her lips

  dead tucker asked

 cody nodded we caught him we
started to ask questions somebody shut
him up for good

  slowly shaking his head tucker
moved to the table he poured a stiff one
and swallowed it another cree they
had to keep it quiet

  codys eyes were steady we dont
figure it that way

  tucker looked up sharply morna had
come nearer the table she stood very
close to brando her eyes bright and hard
talk straight tucker said

  cody was silent for a time he looked
at the girl the brazen painted quillwork
of moccasins more than a man his mind
said more than a man to fear he swung
back to tucker

  where were you last night

  an icy draft moaned in the chimney
a small powdering of snow fell and hissed
in the fire flames leaped higher there
was sweat in the seams of tuckers face
a single drop ran down into his beard

  i dont think i like this gentlemen
you come here on a routine company
check-up youve got no right to make

insinuations

  brando stared at the girl not exactly
routine tucker the girl did not look
away tucker sat down his hands were
out of sight under the table cody re-
membered the heavy colt thrust into the
wide john brown belt

  i told you once mr cody talk
straight

  cody nodded straight he said
mackenzie wants to know why the chan-
dinku fur-take has dropped by two thirds
tucker let out a short laugh the flat
of one big hand slammed the table he
swung to morna

  a fine thing eh my sweet a lot of
gratitude i get i slave to keep this post
out of the red the winters are lousy
the tramplines all but empty-and the
company accuses me of cheating
piratings the word cody told him
selling contraband to a higher bidder
tucker got up and put his arm around
the girl he didnt quit smiling

  ive had a hard day mister i like
music but whistling in the dark bores me
my wife and i did not leave the post
last night youve made indian enemies
thats your lookout the post is open to
inspection ask your questions ask the
crees if im stealing their furs tell me
how i get the goods out of alaska then
prove it

  the grin spilled over into that short
belly-laugh

  stay as long as you like gentlemen
investigate well make you comfortable
well help the genial mask turned to
moma the old north cabin should do
my dear youll show them the way
brando frowned the lines about his
mouth rigid with anger he started to
speak cody shook his head maybe that
didnt stop brando the quick look from
morna did

  cody said thanks for the invite
the hearty laugh came again the girl
slipped into a parka and lit the wick of
another lamp they followed her to the
door a cold blast of night wind brushed
into the cabin

  tucker said one thing more i cant
promise to control the crees forever
cody just looked at him well take
our chances-with the crees

  he closed the door even through the
	northwest romances

heavy planks he could hear the jibing roll
of tuckers answering laughter

  they crossed the compound through
pallid starlight the bobbing lamp made
a brighter lake around them mornas
skin was flushed with the cold her dark
eyes moved to brando at her elbow then
lowered nice touch cody thought mod-
esty and invitation in one neat package
brando was smiling to himself cody didnt
like it

  he didnt like the stillness either the
silent statues of indians by dwindling
lodge fires a screech-owl hooted in the
spruce stand beyond the tents ice mut-
tered contracting over the river getting
the pack from their sled they passed the
chiefs lodge tantlaks heavy-lidded gaze
trailed them the blackened welts of hob-
nails stood out above his temple moma
shivered walking closer to brando cody
frowned

  the north cabin was one room with
gray dusty bunks and a draft through
the crumbled logchinking the butterfly
lamp flame hovered playing on the warm
hollow of mornas throat she paused at
the door her eyes still holding brando

  she said my cabin is next to the
office if you want anything   

  the words were for both of them the
tone was for brando

  cody looked at her well make out
brando worked that easy boyish smile
too long in the barrens maam lost
his eye for beauty

  she colored nicely then quickly with
a shade of fear i hope you will stay
well stay brando nodded a long
while

  moma went out

ill

the lamp flickered the fresh pine
and violet scent of her skin was still
in the cabin neither man spoke there
was kindling in a bin by the bunkwall
cody started a fire in the squat potbellied
stove brando leaned by the window star-
ing across the compound finally he said
now what

  cody rolled a cigarette now nothing
the pale eyes narrowed im not so
sure

  cody lit up tossed a splinter of tinder

into the stove tuckers got it tied up
these crees arent going to talk whiskey
and terror its a sweet technique

  brando turned his mouth smiled but
his eyes glittered with that undertow of
violence the indians wont talk but
somebody might

  twin ribbons of smoke drifted from
codys nostrils shes his wife

  thats why shed know the faqts
  and hide them

  the smile went tight she could be
innocent cody she could be under his
thumb and crying to get free

  and i could be president geveland
  maybe you ought to shut up

  cody just looked at him brando turned
and walked to the window

  shell talk he said all she needs
is a sympathetic listener

  cody killed his cigarette against the
bunkpost thats out

  brando wasnt hearing cabin next to
the office he said if you want any-
thing   he straightened the smile
was handsome sure again

  codys voice was even i said thats
out

  remember the dead cree glory-boy
this could be your second mistake
brando started for the door

  what about beth cody said

  it was more than a name it was dark
clean-smelling hair and the soft lips of a
girl laughing as she danced at the forty-
mile shindig to the lilting squall of a fiddle
beth wasnt far away anymore she was
here in the cabin between them brando
wheeled slowly the grin looked painted-
on

  what about her this is strictly busi-
ness

  they stood face to face quietly cody
said dont get twisted dix dont head
out on the wrong trail

  brando let go a vicious sideband codys
head slammed back against the bunkpost
his mouth had a wet salt taste one fist
knotted control wasnt easy he man-
aged

  yeah he said strictly business
brandos neck reddened abruptly he
turned and went out

  cody could still taste blood he got a
canteen from the sled-pack the whiskey
burned he washed it through his teeth
the wolf-woman of chandindu



and spat he stood quite still staring
at space you deserved it his mind said
you asked for it brandos right you
think of beth and everything else goes hay-
wire forget beth remember the job
the job quillwork moccasins small
prints in a moonlit hillgrove the minx
knows something and brandos the boy
to find out sure the job

  he built up the fire the stove hissed
and blushed orange at the seams the
room was still cold he brewed scalding
black tea it was rotten but it kept him
awake he built a cigarette beyond the
steamy window nothing moved tucker
was still busy in the office the lamp burned
steadily curtains were drawn on the cabin
next door an occasional cree ghost drifted
across the white clearing snow eyeing
codys window tantlak sat statuelike by
his fire it was too still cody sat smok-
ing the colt on the table beside him
eight cigarettes later he heard the foot-
steps

  tliey belonged to two people-one stride
heavy and long the other quick and light
and trying to keep pace codys hand
covered the gun the door opened he
relaxed brandos lips stretched thin with
the smile

  no second mistake glory-boy

  cody let it go he watched morna close
the door and stand with her back to it
her expression was just right timid but
anxious for talk dark eyes moving hope-
fully from him to brando

  shes got evidence cody asked

  brando drank from the canteen set it
down

  youre looking at an eye-witness

  cody didnt smile back the girls lips
opened her breasts rose and fell under
the tight blouse brandos tone was too
gentle

  its all right morna tell him

  she crossed to the table the movement
looked impulsive her voice trembled i
have been hoping so long i thought the
company would never send someone

  you know about the missing pelts
cody asked

  mr brando said you would help me
she made the name sound like a prayer
for two winters my husband this   
animal has sent many men on treks far
north of here indian trains with packs

of a hundred skins each he said the furs
went to the company but the nearest post
lies south so i knew he was hiding them
   somewhere

  codys expression did not change and
the indians

  brando was impatient you know how
he kept them quiet

  without answering cody poured whis-
key into a cup and offered it to morna
she shook her head eyes wide uncertain
he drank it himself and stared at her
i dont know one thing he said i
dont know why you kept quiet

  color rose warmly along her cheeks
she turned to brando i do not under-
stand i try to help and you turn against
me

  it was convincing a nerve twitched in
brandos jaw

  damn it cody shes willing to stand
evidence for the company

  after keeping quiet for two years
softly morna said you forget my
husbands reputation i am a woman much
easier to torture and kill than a cree
brave youve got to believe me if you
leave me here now   

  a thick voice said hell believe you
something happened to momas face
it was no longer young and lost the eyes
hardened through drawn lips her teeth
showed small and white and predatory
cody sat very still brandos hand inched
down to the thonged holster

  tucker said you wont need that
chechako

  he stood short and square in the door-
way cradling the double-barreled shot-
gun  the muzzle was trained on brandos
chest tucker had that fat smile in place
but his breath came in ragged wheezes and
under the blond beardstubble his skin was
gray and dead-looking little gusts of
wind swooped in from the compound
ruffling his thin lank hair he eyed the
girl

  theyll believe you little minx men
always do

  the raw tone made morna step back and
breathe dix    brando didnt move
the shotgun hadnt lost bead

  tucker nodded little morna always
had a way with the boys and a real busi-
ness head smart quick the grin went
lopsided smart enough to see the tide


northwest romances

turn and switch colors eh little minx

  nobody said anything his face was
sweating as he advanced his mouth was
wet it was crazy but he looked as if he
might cry cody leaned slowly forward
in the chair tucker didnt notice any-
thing but the girl

  smart enough to knife a fat old man
in the back when a pretty-boy chechako
comes along testify against me eh may-
be youd like to hear some real testimony
gentlemen

  morna had backed away now she stood
flat against the wall a cornered she-wolf
her beauty wild and bare-fanged

  hes lying dix trying to drag me
down with him he hasnt hurt me
enough

tucker laughed it wasnt a normal
sound the gun-barrel swung abrupt-
ly to moma she screamed cody made
his move he went in low tucker stag-
gered sidewise and swore cody brought
up a pile-driving left knuckles dug into
the thick midriff cody saw the clubbed
rifle stock coming and pain sliced across
his head just over the ear he sank to one
knee the kerosene lamp went out of
focus tucker was a blurred shadow wheel-
ing for the door brando took three steps
and halted with the shotgun against his
belly tucker backed out the door
slammed cody felt hot stickiness run down
behind his ear he made his feet brando
had the colt free and the door flung wide
two shots rocked in the stillness and the
lamp vibrated shrilly brando cursed and
levelled the colt again

  cody said we want him alive we
want those skins

  it wasnt necessary brando didnt fire
again his face was dead white his eyes
flared

  he made the headquarters cabin
brando said

  he turned to moma sobbing hands
covering her face she leaned against him
brando said softly well get him mor-
na

  over her shoulder codys gaze held
his for a second beth was in the room
again cody turned to the table and poured
a drink finally the girl stopped crying
wide innocent eyes looked up at brando

  hell barricade the office hes got a

small arsenal in there

  brando went to the sledpack he broke
the winchester checked the load and
snapped it shut the metallic click sounded
loud in frozen quiet brando headed for
the door i dont mind blasting him out
cody set the canteen down hard no
guns therere other ways

  pale eyes slitted brandos mouth
worked no words came cody took the
colt from the table and hitched it into
his belt he went out through the open
door the girl stared at brando after
a minute they followed

  tiny puffs of powdery topsnow lifted
on the night wind across the clearing a
tangle of tom brush rolled into their path 
brando kicked it impatiently it bounced
away and came to rest against a hitchpost
cody took several strides and halted the
compound had been empty it wasnt
empty now

  down at the south rim beyond view of
headquarters the crees stood in a long
motionless line smouldering faggot-glow
played across gold armbands and hunger-
gaunt faces eastward in lodge shadows
the squaws stood silent holding children
close to ragged skirts over a score of
bucks flanked the dark lean tallness of
tantlak they were armed to the teeth

  brando cursed hoarsely cody heard the
girl draw a sharp breath without a word
alone he went on across the compound
it was a long walk his mukluks made
sad crunching noises the office windows
were black but there was no movement
no quicksilver glint of rifle-metal

  the crees muttered one brave drew
his hunting knife cody came on steadily
he stopped in front of the chief he
spoke in dialect

  you will not stop us now

  the indians made an unsure animal
sound tantlak raised one hand - the
sound quit the chief stared at cody
the white man will talk

  codys mouth felt dry he met the blade
stare

  tucker is finished we know every-
thing of the torture and theft he hides
now like a wolf at bay waiting to be
taken to face the white mans law

  moccasins shifted in the snow behind
indian masks hope flickered

  tantlak was expressionless and when
the wolf-woman of chandindu	

tucker is gone

  there will be a new factor cody
said a just man there will be no more
fear there will be salmon and deermeat
and true payment for the riches of your
traps your tribe will not decay and go
down into the earth

  a papoose whimpered and was hushed
by its mother the silence was complete
once wavering tantlak stared past cody
to brando and the girl then deliberately
he unsheathed his knife and held the hilt
toward cody

  fear is like the black hole dug by the
snakes fang it must be cut out we are
with you

  quickly now brando crossed the clear-
ing the smile fixed in icehard eyes moma
stayed close to him never in range of the
headquarters windows she did not look
at the crees

  all right brando snapped enough
palaver for one night he swung to the
chief if youre with us you take or-
ders

  tantlak looked at him nodded slowly
brando gripped the rifle tight

  your men are armed more than
twenty-to-one against tucker get the
women clear we mean to charge

  a low rumble ran among the indians
tantlak did not move a vein stood out
in brandos forehead you heard the
order

  tantlak shook his head we are not
afraid to die in battle yet we do not
walk like blind fawns to certain slaughter
the black stare turned calmly to cody
we will take commands from the leader
brandos face stopped being handsome
he took a step toward the chief cody
stepped between them put the gun up
dix

  brando didnt tn the grove beyond the
lodges the screechowl cried

  put it up cody said

  brando did cody said the indians
right that doors made of two-inch
planks probably barricaded tucker could
pick them off like flies

  the tension eased brando didnt meet
the girls glance

  maybe you got a better plan

  a plan that wont cost a massacre
cody looked at moma theres an en-

trance from your cabin

  she nodded

  a back door

  she nodded again cody swung back to
brando and the chief

  youll stay here tucker cant see you
hell worry wait for a charge he wont
expect one man from the back way

  brando smiled thinly and youre the
man

  cody spun the colts barrel checking
the chambers we want tucker breath-
ing hes going to tell us where he cached
those pelts

 he thought mornas eyes widened
briefly switching to brando

  brando kept grinning glory-hogging
again

  cody said theres a job to do i dont
figure to kill indians doing it he turned
to tantlak ill yell if i need you

  the cree nodded that was all

  without looking at brando or the girl
cody headed back through the chill dark
of the grove beyond the lodges

  he tried to shut out thought he tried
to forget the silent questioning look that
had passed from moma to brando he
circled the post widely blue-green bran-
ches shuddered with his passing dropping
small muted avalanches of snow and brit-
tle needles he cleared the spruce stand
at the north end beyond the office cabin
cutting west and south again through
the high shielding passes of tundras

  malemutes kiyi-ed in the corral behind
headquarters his fingers felt numb on
the carved hilt of tantlaks knife the
wind bit at his face ahead now he saw
mornas cabin low against the tall stone
finger of the headquarters chimney
there were no lights he was halfway
to the back door when the firing started

  cody cursed and broke into a run in
the compound cree guns flared orange
against the night a heavier rifle ham-
mered steadily in tuckers office pain
screams lifted wild and drained away to
moans but the indians kept firing cody
shouldered into the small cabin and down
the dark connecting passage the screams
got worse one cree let out a high
agonized wail and the cry of a squaw an-
swered
	northwest romances

  cody felt sick over and over his mind
said the fool the damn gun-crazy fool
the office was black and the stink of
burnt powder bit his nostrils he moved
slow and careful against the gray square
of the east window he glimpsed tucker
levering steel into the smoking rifle cham-
bers shouldering the butt in the sharp
flame of the shot he saw the broad face
tucker was laughing

  outside over the screams brandos
hoarse voice rattled commands tucker
kept firing cody edged forward as
sound thundered in the cabin a sound
heavier than the gun-roar the door
planks sagged inward and shuddered
brando shouted again the battering-ram
exploded against the planks tucker grated
indian rats and pumped the rifle the
ram shot home again flatly in the next
brief silence cody said thats all mis-
ter

  tuckers head swivelled wildly the
jowls and mouth were gray in the window
light the laugh didnt re-echo he lunged
forward trying to wheel he wasnt made
for fancy footwork the massive torso
lurched as he brought up the gun-barrel
cody was in under it jarring the muzzle
high slamming out with a backhand right
the rifle bellowed and overhead glass
tinkled and the hangdown lamp swung
crazily codys left found soft gut and
wind jolted out of tucker he lunged
back arms flung wide a chair-leg shat-
tered under his reeling weight

  some of the wounded were still scream-
ing the cabin rumbled with the rams
impact the heavy doorbar gave and
cracked tucker was on his feet wheez-
ing like a wounded musk-ox circling
cody for the charge cody set his feet
as the door splintered and crashed wide
spilling moonglow into darkness hulk-
ing low in the light tucker closed in
then beyond him in the doorway an-
other figure squared off lifting a rifle
cody yelled no dix it was lost
in the ripping blast of the gun

  tucker stopped dead and stared stupidly
at nothing brando fired again a bullet
in the spine straightened tucker con-
vulsively he rocked on his heels for a
moment then fell like a damp-rotten log

he tumbled over on his back and lay
still a fallen whiskey bottle came to
rest near one clawed hand the liquid
draining slowly from its shattered neck

  cody was breathing hard his lips were
a taut thread he bent down tuckers
eyes were open the first bullet had torn
out the front just over the heart dark
blood welled soaking into the plaid mack-
inaw cody stood up and faced brando
i said wed take him alive

  the answer was slow in coming bran-
dos back was to the light cody could
not see his expression but the tone of
faint surprise sounded real

  it was him or you cody maybe you
ought to thank me

  maybe cody looked down at the
dead sagging face he couldve told us
everything now theres only   

  he cut it short looked at brando
quickly then shouldered out through the
door

iv

the snow was red with paling
stains that trailed across the com-
pound a child cried and a silent brave
sat holding his crushed knee between his
hands tuckers fire had caught one cree
full in the mouth n old squaw sat crad-
ling his ruined head in her arms she
did not cry her face was empty two in-
dian woman tried to make her come away
she sat there at the south edge tant-
lak watched cody and brando advance
his arm was bleeding under the tom buck-
skin tunic he didnt notice turned on
brando his eyes were dull and sick

  there are six dead three were no
more than striplings

  you dont win battles without losses
brando said

  codys gaze raked the clearing came
back to brando

  where is she 

  brando looked puzzled

  the girl where is she

  the pale stare flattened i wasnt
guarding her i had my own troubles
she got away

  i told you once she didnt know any-
thing

cody kept looking at him first
the wolf-woman of chandindu	

tucker now the girl the only two that
could lead us to the cache

  brando went rigid he took a stride
toward cody then drew up calm again
with the winchester resting in the fold
of his arm

  you worry too much cody maybe
its my deal from here in

  whats that supposed to mean

  the wounded liad quit moaning the
old squaw still sat cradling the dead boys
head slowly now in the white silence
of the compound cody felt it a change
in brando a harder self-assurance cody
turned to the cree chief tantlak looked
away

  i will see to the digging of graves
i told you not to charge cody yelled
at him

  the indian started away cody snagged
his arm

  do you always send your children to
slaughter

  it hit home old half-buried pride
flared tantlak freed his arm the black
gaze reached past cody to brando

  there were other orders the cree
said orders from him who will be the
new factor of chandindu

  cody turned brando was smiling
thats the story cody i talked to
mackenzie the night before we rolled out
mac remembers old friends-and promises
do a good job dix well need a new
boss for that post

  cody stood there a sinew in his jaw
tensed and relaxed and tensed again

  i talked to beth too brando said
shell come up now that its over bring
that circuit-riding preacher along he
looked at the dark hulk of headquarters
well be married in our new   

  cody hit him hard across the mouth
brando went back a step but the gun
didnt come up

part payment for six dead crees
cody said theres more to answer for
carefully brando remade the smile
their eyes held codys voice was too
quiet

  i could ride back to fortymile i
could tell mackenzie about a dead factor
a prisoner that just happened to escape

-northwest romances-winter

a fortune in furs that we never found
he might wonder why you   

  brando shook his head youre not
the type besides he wouldnt listen nei-
ther would beth i performed my duty
as i saw it cody nobody listens to
the crooked lies of a jealous suitor
and the pelts

  brando laughed theres time ill lo-
cate the cache ill turn the furs over
to the company

  cody stared at him for a long time
  sure he said flatly sure you will
  brando laughed

it didnt take long the crees were
still filling graves when brando started
to move in he sat by the west window
at tuckers rolltop desk in tuckers
swivel chair he smoked watching the
indians struggle under the old trunks
hauling them to the bonfire at the center
of the clearing the last of tucker went
up in russet flames that colored the office
window leapt higher in the raw wind that
swept south from the tundras

  the office was quiet cody did not
talk he sat at the table under the new
glass-chimneyed lamp from time to time
he refilled the whiskey jigger at his elbow
the liquor got to him burning his throat
and chest it didnt make him feel better
it didnt make brandos smile easier to
take

  brando watched the slow pulsing of
bonfire glare he looked at the fresh-
scrubbed floorplanks and furniture the
gaudy indian blankets decorating the walls
the daguerreotype of beth on the chimney-
piece

  he grinned shell like it shell like
it fine

  cody drank brandos voice was like
a taunting nettle pricking and waiting and
pricking again

  she wrote a letter she gave it to
the cree when he got to fortymile with
my report she says mackenzie thinks we
did a damn good job

  we cody said dont get generous
it ill-becomes you

  brando laughed riding gently in the
swivel chair he had the look of a gambler
with all the chips and a pat hand
northwest romances



  shell be here tomorrow with the
preacher

  cody didnt answer

  so its all settled brando lifted a
paper from the desk-a long letter in
official-looking script my appointment
as factor a home a wife contented in-
dian trappers

  sure codys eyes came up quick and
hard the crees are tickled to death
whats a few casualties in a noble cause

  brando rose and came to the table

  he filled a jigger and lifted it his gaze
mocking over the rim

  yes sir all we need is a best man

  cody set his glass down hard his eyes
narrowed after a minute he got up and
walked out he didnt look back he
knew brando would be standing there
still smiling

  the sled came the next morning the
rubdown porch of headquarters had been
half-decorated by the indians they
hadnt finished the job squaws sat silent
under the flies of empty lodges tantlak
stood near his tent circled by a knot of
staring hardfaced bucks they watched
the sled tilt its nose up and then down
over the final rise and round the south
bend of the spruce grove nobody laughed
or cheered

  cody rolled a cigarette in the cold
shade of the porch brando frowned at
the unfinished trimmings of quillworked
robes and tanned hides and bright-hued
beads

  steel blades squealed to a halt and male-
mutes jumped in the traces or squatted
for a rest panting the preacher stood
by the geepole tall and bone-thin with
a solemn smile on his face beth climbed
out of the fur-covered seat and tossed
back the hood of her parka her hair
glistened in the brittle northern sunlight
like warm whiskey to a man numbed by
arctic trailwind and snow she waved
one mittened hand

  brando ran down the steps cody stood
smoking he saw brando catch beth in
his arms and whirl her about heard the
sound of her laughter full and clear in
the morning stillness the indians watched
waiting slowly cody walked out to the
sled

  preachei- cotton was booming in a

righteous kindly voice but behind their
pouches his eyes kept flicking uneasily
to tantlak and the circle of cree braves
beth laughed her hand warm in codys

  isnt it wonderful captain mac was
so pleased with dixs report

  i can imgaine cody said

  she linked arms with brando were
really grateful for tlie way you helped
dix

  cody only nodded his chest felt tight
he wanted to smash that satisfied grin
from brandos face maybe beth felt the
tension she paused uncertain the
preacher coughed and she followed his
unquiet glance to the watching indians
now her voice sounded a little too bright

  youll stay for the wedding tomorrow
cody

  brando laughed hugging her close
didnt i tell you codys going to be
best man arent you

  cody managed a smile so did beth
but it was strained her eyes searched
brandos face it was as though she were
looking at someone she didnt quite know

  brando said youll be wanting a toddy
after that long trek eh preacher

  cotton bent his solemn mouth i sup-
pose it is in order a toast to the happy
couple

  they started across the compound the
squaws sat quiet with no chatter or smiles
for beth the braves drew closer a tight
wall behind tantlak halfway to the
cabin brando halted he looked at the
cree chief and his grin flattened just
a minute he said

  beth glanced quick from him to cody
dix   

  brando didnt wait he moved in short
choppy strides his hand swinging free
just over the holstered  the indians
didnt stir preacher cotton muttered
something it sounded like a prayer

  brando spoke very clearly  told you
the decorations were to be finished i told
you the squaws were to cook a special
dinner

  tantlak eyed him without blinking my
people are in mourning they haw no
cause for celebration

  cody saw brando pale the square jaw
clamped shut the hell you say maybe
you didnt savvy im giving the orders
the wolf-woman of chandindu



here things are changed

  you say they are changed my people
wonder a different man rules chan-
dindu yes black eyes swung acrcss the
glittering compound to beth but not
a different woman

  the words slurred beside cody the
girl lifted her hand and let out a small
hurt cry dix    no cody swore and
took a step forward brando struck out
again the indian spilled sideward his
head jarring hunger-weak legs gave under
him cree braves surged forward like a
roused pack brandos knuckles went livid
around the colt butt he could have
fired from the hip the crees didnt come
any nearer without taking his eyes from
them brando reached down and hauled
tantlak to his feet the chief moaned
cody felt beths grip tighten on his arm
in a low flat voice brando said the
decorating will be done the food will
be cooked tomorrow there will be a
celebration

  tantlak didnt answer his eyes had a
fixed finished look cody had seen the
look before-when black tucker was liv-
ing

  brando turned and walked back to
beth his skin was flushed he smiled
beths head moved from side to side
unbelieving

  dix    did you have to   
youll get used to it lady somebody
has to control these damn  

  the preacher coughed but my boy
brandos glance cut him short the
lips kept smiling the pale eyes didnt

  youre here to preach a wedding cot-
ton thats all

  well how about that toddy

they went on toward headquarters
cody and the preacher walked a lit-
tle to the rear ahead brando had his
arm about beths shoulder again but she
wasnt as close to him as she had been

  at twilight the cabin was dark they
ate by candlelight the flames were tall
and thin glittering on the glass candlelabra
beth had brought from fortvmile catch-
ing fire in the brazen designs of cree
blankets that draped the walls there was
rich food and a bottle of skagway wine

sent up for the wedding by captain mack-
enzie cody drank without tasting it
vaguely the booming jokes of the preacher
came to him he heard himself answer
it seemed unreal nothing was real but
beths eyes meeting his time and again
dark and questioning glancing quickly
away as if afraid of an answer

  her gown made small rustling sounds
her skin was cool and white by candle-
glow and her voice like the sudden thaw
of a late-spring freshet here in the lonely
arctic reaches but she spoke too often
anxious to fill the long silences her smile
was fixed and trembling brando didnt
notice after half-a-bottle his tone got
loud and heavily mocking once a squaw
nearly spilled a steaming soupbowl the
sharp flare of his eyes wasnt nice to see
he drank some more cody was glad when
the meal ended

  outside it was better dusk wind stirred
the powdered topsnow of the compound
cody breathed deep and leaned against
the split log porch-rail he made and lit
a cigarette frowning through the smoke
at the completed decorations the smoul-
dering lodge fires far across the clearing

  beths slippers made little noise on the
rough planking he could smell the violet-
scented freshness of her hair they did
not look at each other for a time she
stood by the rail watching the lifeless
compound softly she said

  the preachers a chess expert dix bet
he could beat him

  cody made a smile behind them in
the cabin brandos voice was boisterous
and whiskey-edged they heard the clink
of bottle and glass cody smoked wait-
ing conscious that they both waited for
something beth kept watching the clear-
ing finally it came

  whats happened to him cody hes
so    different

  he half-turned to her ready to speak
the lost puzzled look of her face stopped
him he shrugged

  a man likes to show-off for his bride-
to-be

  beth shook her head that indian he
looked weak and sick he couldnt even
fight back

  cody didnt answer the bellow of
	northwest romances

 brandos laugh rolled out into gray still-
 ness it took her a long time but she said
 it

  and the words he used    before
dix hit him he said    not a different
woman   abruptly she turned to
him her eyes bright again probing it
meant something cody you know what
it meant

  gently cody said listen beth dont
 get hurt

  she was very close he could feel her
breathing

  i dont know she murmured i
never knew a man like dix i thought i
loved him but when i saw the way he
   maybe even before the indian i
sensed something    something wrong
cody  

  she swayed nearer her lips parted her
 eyes deep and warm

  then she turned away

  its no good cody

  i know

  hes sick inside he needs me i cant
 leave him now

  cody ground his cigarette into the rail
 a tiny shower of red sparks drifted down
 dying in the snow her hand touched
 the whipcord sleeve

  but    cody im all mixed up

  he looked at her

  cody  

  then she was in his arms her body
soft and pliant against him her hands
cool on his face her lips were soft and
answering his arms tightened

  a pretty pose glory-boy a touching
picture

  the girl drew a sharp breath cody let
 her go brando stood in the doorway
 the light behind him glowed palely on
 his hair his eyes had a drunken glitter
 they could hear the slow rasp of his
 breathing

  it would have been better if hed
shouted struck out in fury he stood
there weaving slightly smiling

  a bit early cody you dont kiss the
 bride till after the wedding

  beths gown rustled as she moved
toward him dix

  quite all right my dear a harmless
little fling didnt mean to butt in the

preacher got sleepy and went to bed
she shook her head even in the yellow
glare of the doorway she looked pale
her mouth quivered without another
word she brushed past brando into the
cabin he stepped aside with a taunting
bow

  cody waited his feet set wide his eyes
level

  youre all wrong brando shes con-
fused but shell stick shes that kind
she thinks you need her

  brando smiled like i said-touching
the corner of the smile twitched theres
dust in the office safe ill pay you off
tonight i reckon well do without a best
man

  lean jaw muscles knotted he started
for brando then slowly relaxed some-
thing went out of his eyes let it go his
mind said maybe shes right maybe it
couldnt work-you and beth shes not
made for running away from promises
maybe its better this way-for her

  he followed brando into the office
the birch fire was low comer shadows
were cold and black and melted wax had
stained the glass candlelabra cody glanced
past the beaded curtain far down the
connecting hall a bar of light showed
under beths door he thought he could
hear the muted sound of her crying

  brando stooped over the fat-bellied
floorsafe the tumblers rolled and clicked
on the table the dinner dishes looked
stale and ugly cody poured three fingers
it didnt warm him brando brought the
dust pouch and a small scale to the table
it was very quiet the spilling gold span-
gles made a tinny drumming in the tray
the scale dipped brando emptied it into
a second pouch and threw it across the
table candle flames wavered with the
breath of his movement cody did not
touch the pouch he eyed brando

  the pay-off he said this settles
everything

  everything you finish a job you mush
on theres a calico pony in the shed
youll move quicker with him

  cody weighted the pouch in one palm
his tone stayed even

maybe you ought to do the same
brando had lifted the bottle measuring
wine against firelight he set it down
the wolf-woman of chandndv



there was no expression in his face
  lets say what we mean

  cody kept it soft dont get in too
deep brando clear out now-while you
can beth wants you all right but i
wouldnt like to see her hurt

  the grin was forced you think im
crazy 

  maybe not but youre heading down
a one-way trail ive seen what power
can do to men-decent honest chechakos
with good intentions then they get too
much power in their fists it goes black
inside and rots like frostbite the good
intentions peel away he set the pouch
on the table get out dix take beth
with you together you can make a better
life somewhere    anywhere but here
brando just stared this time the raw
laugh was real

  and you call me crazy walk out
on a sweet set-up like this listen cody
im boss now i got a good house good
grub the best whiskey im going to have
a wife im going to make this god-
forsaken hole pay

  in more ways than one

  a log-skeleton sagged on the hearth
the smile faded

  talking in riddles again

  maybe cody said a lot of maybes
maybe youre not figuring on more than
an honest percentage maybe you did gun
tucker to save my hide maybe mornas
gone for good and never told you about
that nice fat cache

  brando had lost his schoolboy com-
plexion

  he swayed a little bracing his hands
flat on the table

  still at it glory-boy youd like to
steal my job with lies youd like to turn
beth against me a jealous punk will
do a lot of rotten   

  the short brutal left caught him square
in the mouth he reeled back clutching
at the tablecloth dragging it with him
plates and cups rattled along the floor
the wine bottle teetered and spilled dark
red on the white linen closing in cody
let go another left feeling the power of
it drive up from his planted feet brando
grunted his head lolled doll-like as he
pitched against the log wall clawing for
support

  his lower lip was split blood ran down
his chin he made panicky whimpering
noises and dragged the colt free of lea-
ther codys knee jammed the gun wrist
against rough bark grinding hard
brando swore the gun clattered to the
floor collaring him with his right cody
slammed the left back and forth across
the bobbing face

  the beaded curtain rustled cody

  he stopped he turned unsteadily
breathing fast and faced beth there was
blood on his knuckles when he let go
brando sagged hanging against the wall
gasping air through the torn hole of his
mouth cody shook his head listen
beth   

  her face was quite still there was
nothing at all in her eyes she went past
him she got brandos arm around her
shoulders and helped him to the couch
by the fire cody stood there watching
as she tore a strip from her petticoat and
soaked it with whiskey she bathed bran-
dos lips he winked his head rolling from
side to side

  beth cody said

  she turned on him the movement swift
with pale anger

  that was it she said you just
wanted to win you couldnt stand los-
ing

  cody straightened his voice was quiet
if you see it that way

  she wavered unsure for a moment
brando coughed and groaned her mouth
set again

  hes sick he needs help not a beat-
ing i guess he was right jealousys a
pretty rotten thing

  it ait deep and hard cody didnt blink
he watched her bathe brandos mouth
with deft gentle touches after a time
he picked up the dustpouch and tucked
it into his belt at the door he said
ill take the pony ill head out by sun-
up

  he didnt wait for an answer

v

get out his mind said saddle the
calico and ride and keep riding only
he wasnt listening to his mind

  he struck for the north cabin past
	northwest

the front gate of the dog corral male-
mutes lay sleeping dug into small snow-
pits for warmth the last gray light was
gone beyond the winking sleepless stare
of cree fires the ice-strangled river and
lonely tundras reached away into empty
darkness nothing he thought beyond
here beyond beth-nothing

  the cabin was cold he lit the lamp
wick the potbellied stove was black with
dead ashes he didnt build a fire he got
the canteen and swallowed a stiff drink
he screwed on the lid and stood silent
for a long time his mouth worked
abruptly he let fly the canteen clanked
against the wall and rolled to rest in
tangled bunkblankets cody lay down and
shut his eyes why wait  why hang
around till morning dont kid yourself
glory-boy morning wont be better he
could see that grinning mask against his
closed eyelids he could hear that cool
taunting laugh   

  shut up

  the lamp vibrated to the ragged sound
of his voice

  he took another drink forget he told
himself sleep and torget a moment n
the blue shadows of the porch and the
arch of beths body to his circling arm
the deep promise of her lips parted under
his it didnt mean a thing not a thing
just a mixed-up kid needing a shoulder
to cry on good old cody the man with
the friendly shoulder damn good old
cody the canteen tilted a little whiskey
spilled along his jaw he wiped it away
forget this morning too shut out the
memory of uneasy fear in her eyes when
brando butchered the cree get rid of
the notion that the whole mess is twisted
and wrong forget

  in the end the liquor got to him the
lamp glow swayed with the soughing
cabin drafts and went far away he
dozed it was like dreaming something
had roused the huskies one dog yapped
and whined endlessly there was a creek
of steel runners on packed snow and
somewhere a door closed cody jolted to
a sitting position he felt sweat along
the small of his back the lamp wick
simmered low there was no sound at
all he swore silently nerves waiting

romances

and nerves with a sudden final move-
ment he got up

  it didnt take long to pack the saddle
roll it was not thinking now it was
moving acting letting it all go for good
there was no emotion in codys face as
he hauled on mukluks and parka the ker-
osene flame still burned he ignored it
outside there was no moon the sky hung
black and heavy and there was a tang
of snow in the air that ripped down from
the barrens a light still gleamed in bran-
dos office but the window of beths
room was dark cody didnt look at it
he headed for the corral

  at first he didnt notice the sled he
started toward the clapboard leanto where
the calico was stalled then the fresh
scars of sled blades printed themselves
across his consciousness he frowned
turning to follow them the sled had been
parked in black shadow by the rear cabin
wall its seat was loaded with a heavy
grub pack and sleeping bag the male-
mutes bright-eyed with hunger and a long
haul were still lashed in the traces the
sled didnt belong at chandindu

  cody crossed to the shed it was dark
inside and heavy with the odor of stale
mash and horse nitrogen the calico whin-
neyed blowing against the raw wind from
the door cody gentled it reaching up
to the peg-hung saddle his hands stopped
halfway his mouth went stiff

  the sounds came clear and sharp in
night stillness-the murmuring jumble of
footsteps in the softer corral snow cody
stood in black shadows behind the cali-
cos stall a long minute passed rest-
less dogs whimpered in the corral the
warped leanto door groaned wider then
shut and the sound of breathing was loud
in the dark a lamp-shutter creaked
shrilly a wedge of light cut across the
shed cody could see brandos pale face
the eyes were harsh with damned-up
fury so was the voice

  i told you to stay away

  nobody answered

  the calicos here cody wont ride
out til morning you shouldve waited

  the other figure was motionless back
to cody short and thickset in a mans
oarka and mukluks
the wolf-woman of chandindu



  brando said theres beth too if she
gets curious  

  the short figure moved forward half-
turning the front of the parka was
open the hood fell back thick russet
hair gleamed framing the soft white face
and throat the red smiling lips the body
under mannish clothes was all woman
momas smile twisted

  yes the sweet innocent beth it
would never do  

  you shouldve waited brando snapped
a week to be safe

  some things wont wait

  an uneasy scowl edged anger out of
brandos stare

  moma said im heading for the cache
tonight

  trouble

  not yet there could be if jessup
gets wind of tuckers death he might
lose his head i have to get to him before
anyone else i have to tell him nothings
changed

  the shed was cold but sweatbeads glis-
tened under brandos eyes

  he wont balk

  moma laughed it should have been
throaty and clinging to match her soft
womans face it wasnt

  jessup takes orders she said he
guards the cache and gets his cut tuckers
finished youre taking over with me
thats all

  she moved closer to brando her voice
lowering

  another year and we ship the furs
out a yukon steamer captain buys them
no strings no questions asked then
its the top dix then its you and me
and a fortune

  her mouth was open turned up to
his her eyes had a hungry animal look
brando didnt kiss her he smiled crook-
edly

  and no tricks i can trust the little
minx 

  the eyes widened sharply unsheathed
claws trust thats my line isnt it
how can i be sure of you what about
this sweet bit of fluff

  breath went out of her as brando drew
her close his arm tightened under the
loose parka

  shes nothing moma you know it
i knew it the minute i saw you shes
a front a pretty domestic picture to show
the company like you said one more
year and  

  his mouth covered hers long white
fingers clawed burying themselves in his
hair holding the kiss cody could hear
them breathing

  in a thick whisper brando said let
me know how you make out

  moma nodded wet red lips smiling
wait up for me ill be back

  the heavy mannish clothes muttered
then she was gone the door swung to
thumping idly the calico stirred and the
stallion in the next stall nickered for a
long time brando did not move his face
was clear in the lantern glare he was
smiling too

  codys mouth had a bad taste some-
thing burned behind his eyes and one
fist clamped hard on the stall post he
wanted to let go feel that damn grin
smash and break again under driving
knuckles he didnt evidence his mind
rasped none of its any good without
evidence the cache the skins tucker
had pirated and brando figured to build
higher with another season of theft mor-
na was heading out now by dogsled sure
she wouldnt be hard to trail if the
snow held off the calico could catch up

  it took time it took a lifetime of wait-
ing minutes he thought brando would
never move even with brando gone
alone in the dark saddling was slow
careful work he led the calico out through
the rear corral gate he didnt swing
astride till he was well clear of the post
the calico was fresh so was the long
weaving trace of paw-churned snow be-
tween purplish ribs cut bv runners it
struck dead north across river ice toward
the barrens

  a shrill wind was risinsr the calico
drove forward head down blowing
against the needling cut of it once a
foreleg buckled and lurched the pony too
near the rim of a sunken drift cody
hauled taut on the reins wheeling back
to the trail that reached up through black
spruce stands to a higher plateau of dead
white silence the wind got higher the
	northwest

sled-marks blurred with shifting snow
the calico broke through tangled brush
into the clear and ahead abruptly the
land reared in a steep hill that ended
above the snow valley a sheer cliff over-
hanging a two-hundred-foot drop to ice-
capped boulders cody drew in sharply

  the cabin was on a deep ledge set back
from the frozen lip of the cliff windows
blinked light like the eyes of a crouched
wolf and pale smoke blew in heavy clouds
from the chimney it was a good spot
a spot where a single man with a rifle
could command the valley on every side

  cody sat quiet at the grove-edge eyeing
the twin runner-ribbons that slid out and
up the violent grade toward the cabin
he could circle maybe in darkness he
could take the cabin from the rear may-
be but there was a sound now in the
wind a low beating voice wait up for
me ill be back    his jaw set before
dawn the evidence and the skin-pirates
all in one neat bundle he swung the
calico south along the back-trail and dug
in his heels

the cree councilfire had dwindled
to throbbing orange faggots beside
it tantlak sat crosslegged chin buried in
his bony chest a raw gust flurried across
the compound he did not stir under his
skins but his eyes moved slow and
sleepless toward the north cabin

  cody swung down and tethered the
calico to a rail the chief watched him
unbutton the parka and draw back the
right side when cody walked the thonged
colt rode clear just under his fingertips
halfway across the clearing their eyes
met cody kept moving the cree did
not try to stop him

  long easy strides took him through
the puddle of light that spilled from the
office window the porch boards sagged
faintly complaining about his weight his
breath came even he didnt hesitate his
knuckles rapjed quietly on the door
planks

  nothing happened across the deserted
compound tantlak watched cody knocked
again inside a chair scraped softly and
the heavy crossbar slid back the door
edged open

romances

  mor  

  brando didnt finish he had begun a
smile he didnt finish that either he
went back several steps cody shut the
door and leaned against it brando stood
in the middle of the floor his skin had
a gray look about the eyes the drawn
lips behind him the hangdown lamp
swung in a lazy circle brandos voice was
harsh

  i told you to clear out

  keep it down cody told him
  what the hell   

  i said quiet cody glanced at the
black hall beyond the restless beaded cur-
tain let her sleep its better that way
shes had enough trouble

  brando frowned then tried another
grin i dont get you

  dont you

  the bottle was on the green desk blot-
ter cody walked over and measured a
long one he drank he could feel brando
staring waiting

  without turning he said i located
tuckers cache

  no answer the lamp creaked on its
restless chain he thought brandos breath-
ing missed a beat brando moved slowly
to the swivel chair

  good job mackenziell be glad to
hear  

  some things he wont some things
people said in the corral shed

  brando didnt blink he sat down ills
hand on the chair-arm close to a half-
shut drawer of the rolltop

  you cant prove it cody

  a cabin in the barrens is proof and
morna wont sing love songs when she
knows you figured to turn her in if the
going got too  

  it broke off sharply cody made a quick
move toward the desk brandos hand was
quicker the drawer jarred wide the
little derringer looked lost in his fist the
business-end centered on codys middle
he quit moving

  the swivel hinge groaned as brando
eased back he smiled but the tic kept
twitching in his cheek

  thats your trouble glory-boy too
much honesty you shouldve shot first
then explained to mackenzie a little
the wolf-woman of chandindu



mistake that changes everything now i
do the shooting it wont be a nice story
the jealousy that twisted your mind
made you pull a gun on me not nice but
convincing

  he got to his feet smoothly hob-
nails biting the planks moving nearer
cody the pale eyes had a fixed glassy
brilliance this means a lot to me cody
im not settling for half-measures maybe
youd be satisfied with beth and this
pennyante hell-hole some people are al-
ways content to grub in the mud of the
valley momas different so am i were
going all the way glory-boy were going
to the top of the mountain and no valley-
worms going to stop  

  cody moved fast his left clamped on
brandos gunwrist wrenching it wide
his right slammed in like a pile driver
brando jackknifed fonvard and went back
two steps jarring into the desk cody
was over him now digging one elbow deep
under the handsome jaw the only sound
was brandos choking struggle for breath
the gun cody said

  brando struggled the elbow drove
harder

  give me the gun

  he did codys fingers closed on the
small pearl butt he backed away brando
sank into the chair holding his throat
coughing air into cramped lungs the
cold sweat of fear pocked his forehead
the dark red line of the healing split
showed clear on his pale lower lip

  all right he said hoarsely you got
it all now

  i didnt want it this way kid you
dealt the hand

  brando stared up white face suddenly
very young and confused

  listen cody i made mistakes i
thought a lot of crazy things but i didnt
do anything

  cody looked at him and felt a little
sick the voice was a desperate whisper
now

  you hear me cody you got every-
thing all right i made mistakes does
that say i never get another chance
cody was silent brando rose slowly
the words spilled out in a nervous jum-
ble

  itd be better for beth wouldnt it
cody you said you didnt want her
hurt see  no court trial no mud on her
skirts i just ride i get out of the terri-
tory i never come back

  cody turned away from the bloodless
sweating mask

  no you got to listen hell cody
i was all mixed up when i got near that
moma bitch something happened to me
you dont know her shes like a poison
in the blood but i never did anything
i gunned tucker to save you honest
to god cody i never did   

  flatly through clamped teeth cody
said get out

  you wont regret it

  get out of alaska get out and stay
out

  brando got dressed he didnt waste
time he kept throwing quick glances at
codys stiff face cody stood at the table
not watching at the door brando paused
started to speak cody looked at him he
got out cody filled a cup and drank as
if to wash a bad taste from his mouth

  the room was very quiet after a time
he heard huskies snapping and the jar
of runners creaking free of ice-crust
brandos haw was shrill and muted
cody walked to the door and watched the
sled wheel south and east hurrying out
of the compound a few cree braves
had wakened to the night noises they
stared after brando nobody tried to
stop him cody closed the door

  it was right right for beth for every-
body but still  he poured another
one but only stood there frowning swish-
ing the amber liquid gently to and fro
in the cup hell brando was young a
crooked woman could do crazy things to a
chechako sure starting again in a new
country the kid would ride straight right
it had to be right

  the rest was waiting sitting here a
welcoming committee that morna didnt
expect taking her south to the authori-
ties and turning the cache over to mack-
enzie routine he told himself a routine
that would end and time that would pass
time for beth to realize and forget
time when he could be near and ready
to help
	northwest

  thought snapped clean as broken ice
deliberately cody stood up and faced
the door outside steel whined in the
snow and was quiet a second passed
mukluks trod easy on the porchboards
and the inner doorlatch tilted up moma
started to speak the words dried in her
throat spots of color showed high on her
cheekbones the rest of her face was pale
in the fur frame of the parkahood

  cody said shut the door

  she stood still her eye narrowing the
lampchimney shivered in the draft
brando wont like tricks she said
brandos gone

  the colorpatches flamed her mouth
closed hard youre lying

  he ran out morna the dance is all
yours now-and you pay the fiddler

  she came closer small in the heavy man-
nish rig her lips peeled back from white
clamped teeth

  youre a liar

  am i

  liar

  it was a shrill scream savage bewild-
erment shadowed tne restless eyes

  dix wouldnt turn tail it was all
settled even that little mouse he meant
to marry all a front it was him and me
cody heard the soft intake of breath
his gaze swung to the curtained doorway
beth swayed a little staring at the girl
shaking her head in slow stubborn dis-
belief mornas red mouth went out of
shape

  you heard me miss prim love you
a man like dix it was him and me dix
and moma get that cody the two of
us together straight down the line
and this is the last stop cody said
the parka hood fell away as she
lunged for him a cornered wolf with
bared teeth and red hair flying wild cody
sidestepped and caught her arms from be-
hind the grip was sure unyielding she
struggled heavy mukluks kicked back at
his shins she tried to bite him

  get one of the indians beth tell him
to come in cody said

  numbly she nodded and went to the
door morna had quit fighting she stood
very still drawing long quivering breaths
a cree brave came in with beth a -
 rested in the bend of his arm cody

romances

let go of morna

  take her to the north cabin lock her
in stand guard till morning

  the indian straightened his eyes on
cody flickered with respect and old fight-
ing hope moma didnt say any more she
let the cree lead her out all the time her
eyes stayed on the waiting -

  the cabin was still for a time beth
did not move the soft child-like be-
wilderment had not left her face she
looked at cody

  i thought hed change    once we
were   

  i know cody said

  he crossed the room his hands were
gentle on her arms then she cried with-
oue a sound deep inside her face close
against the patient strength of his shoulder
finally she grew quiet dark shining eyes
came up to his

  it was them    dix and her    from
the start

  cody told her the facts he didnt color
them they were bad enough he thought
she might cry again she only pressed
his hand and made a small sad smile she
nodded

  i was afraid i guessed but i couldnt
be sure till i heard her

vi

the scream was high and shrill
cutting outer darkness like the roaf
of a wounded bear cody stiffened beths
fingers closed tight on his in the frozen
moment of shock a sharp totoo of hooves
drummed across the packed snow of the
compound cody said damn and
wheeled for the door the clearing had
gone wild with movement and a babble
of indian voices bucks brushed into the
open through whispering tentflies and
headed for the north cabin preacher cot-
ton came through the offiice in night shirt
and trousers my boy what    it
stopped short as the cry of a squaw rose
again

  cody broke into a run shouldering past
the knot of crees by the north cabin
hitching post the squaw was kneeling
beside the indian that cody had set to
guard moma nobody had to explain the
hunting knife had bitten deep under the
the wolf-woman of chandindu	

left rib cawing and sliced up toward the
center of the chest the wound gaped
still bleeding but the cree was beyond
pain preacher cotton was beside the
squaw now his lips moved in a silent
prayer tantlak stood quiet on the edge of
the crowd his eyes held codys

  alll cody said was ill get her

  the chief did not answer

  beth had reached the cabin cody
turned trying to cut the body from view
she saw it and pressed white knuckles
to her lips cody steadied her he looked
at the hitching post

  she took the calico fresher than her
dog team

  beths eyes stared questioning hd
nodded

  shes after brando it wont be pretty
if she catches up

  she wouldnt  

  his laugh was harsh shes been
crossed beth you dont cross a she-cat
and get away scott free shell smile shell
go into his arms then  

  his gaze moved to the red stain widen-
ing in the snow by the crees body the
squaw was still crying

  go in the house beth

  cody  

  im tired im done playing games it
has to be settled

   but  

  the quiet determination of his face
stopped her he smiled once and kissed
her bps they were warm he turned ab-
ruptly and crossed the clearing to the dog
corral

  it was treacherous going the huskies
werent rested the storm had lowered
giving a dark glow to the tundras cody
swore squinting against the first biting
needles of snow the calicos trace cut
south and east paralleling the ribbons
sliced by brandos sled snow pits waited
just a step from the broken trail the
storm got worse cody concentrated on
beths smile the memory of her standing
alone in the compound watching him drive
out it was better than thinking of what
lay ahead

  white flurries thickened uphill through
a deep stand of evergreen the trace
wavered the runners bogged and had to

be dug clear the team kept pulling gray
arctic dawn glittered on the ice-capped
cones of pine and blue spruce and then the
grove had dropped behind and the long
rise before him was a blizzard-whipped
desert showing nothing but blurred hoof
prints and the bobbing lines of brandos
course

  at the crest of the hill hidden by a
jutting ridge cody hauled in his snapped
order silenced the dogs he lay belly-
flat unconscious of the cold gnaw of
snow against his face westward the
land dropped white and dead to the frozen
chandindu shallows he oould see the
sled standing deserted on the flat and
just east of it the sharp bluff crowned
by jagged outcroppings

  he watched the calico pick its mincing
way along the sled trail the thick figure
swaying man-like in the saddle he
frowned his eyes swung to the eastern
bluff a shadow moved in the outcrop of
boulders early daylight glinted on gun-
metal codys mouth twisted geez no
fire flashed and his cry was lost in the
nasal whine of the slug and down on the
flat the calico reared its reins dragging
the rider straightened sharply then sagged
forward clutching the ponys mane the
body slipped out of the saddle and lay in a
snowbank near the sled one mukluk still
caught in the stirrup the calico pawed
snow blowing shrilly

  the wind beat against silence cody lay
without moving on the east rise the
shadow stirred again stood erect and
walked slowly downgrade the winchester
held tight and ready cody got to his feet
brando didnt notice anything but the
dark crumpled form by the sled he bent
warily rolled it over his curse carried
loud on the whirling storm

  you know dix i wanted to believe
that reformed sinner line

  brandos back went rigid wind and
confusion had blottted out the- whisper of
codys advance bravdo did not turn he
held his crouch the rifle balanced on one
knee large flakes came to rest and melted
slowly on momas empty upturned face
cody spoke quietly now close behind him
and to the left

  you though she was me wearing
	northwest romances

mens clothes riding my calico you
figured id trail you make sure youd
clear out one bullet and business as
usual bushwhack me and everything
would be fi  

  branco pivoted blindly rolling back
bringing up the black barrel and firing
cody tried to fall away to the right it
was no good the yellow spike of fire
burned along his temple and wild northern
lights rocketed in the darkness of his
brain things went out of focus he
pitched face-down in a smothering ice-
crusted drift

  he tried to see brando was only a
fuzzed quick-shifting shadow a pair of
boots and a gunmuzzle too near his head
words seeped down through the stagger-
ing pinwheel of lights

  same old glory-boy never learn will
you shoot glory-boy then talk ive
changed that story a mite like to hear it
i tell the mounties you know about morna
and the cache you trailed her and she
used a rifle you got her but the shot
stunned you twenty-below did the rest
a man dies easy at twenty-below glory-
boy

  cody shook his head it didnt clear
his own voice sounded far away

  it wont tie in brando too many loose
strings

  the laugh ripped across the moaning
storm

  only one string the furs somebody
might wonder why i didnt turn them in
long ago somebody might find jessup
ask questions so they find jessup-dead
and they find the cache burned to the
ground see glory-boy morna did it
when we got too close for comfort morna
was a very nasty little girl    the smile
jelled all right i lose the pelts but
im still factor of chandindu theres
plenty more where they came from

  cody made one knee grabbing for
brandos boot brando stepped back the
ground came up hard cody swore thickly
loose string his mind said always a
loose string somebody knows too much
beth somebody that has to be shut up-
for good  

  cody said you lousy sonofa  

  the hobnails sidestepped again and for
a moment over him cody saw the un-

balanced grin the slow brutal lift of the
gunbutt he started to roll away the
metal heel came down too fast

his arms and legs wouldnt move
somebody was pressing a white hot
faggot against his temple when he tried
to talk his lips were numb and then ting-
ling with the burn of whiskey on liis
tongue running down his throat he
coughed a knee and arm supported his
shoulders the glaring white flats reeled
and righted themselves the canteen-neck
pressed his lips again

  tantlak said drink

  he drank beths voice was close mur-
muring softly you didnt come back i
was afraid the chief offered to help
her fingers gently probed the scalp wound
cody winced then sat up abruptly
brando

  beth shook her head he was gone
when we got here

  how long

  half an hour her hands restrained
him you have to rest your head   
damn my head

  he lurched to his feet and swayed
pain throbbing in the pit of his stomach
beth was at his elbow so was tantlak
cody took raw air deep in his lungs

  all right he said all right now
waiting crees had knotted nearer
someone had covered mornas body with
skins and laid it in one of the sleds har-
nassed malemutes lay watching their jowl
hair silvered by frost more steadily cody
said he hit out for the cache north to
the barrens if he burns those pelts theres
no proof

  tantlak nodded his jaw firm decided
i have sleds i have braves to fight be-
side you

  cody looked at him then grinned he
cant be far ahead even if he did take
the calico he turned to the girl beth
you oughtnt to   

  but her gaze was quiet moving from
him to tantlak its all of us now
cody together

  the cree nodded again briefly codys
arm drew her close

  there was no more talk

  cody took the lead led the storm did
not let up and when they struck north
the wolf-woman of chandindu



the wind was full against them it cleared
codys brain the indians moved quick and
sure hawing the dogs tooling the other
three sleds with sharp skilled wrenches of
the geepole beth didnt speak but more
than once her eyes reached out to cody
he smiled reassurance he didnt feel
like smiling

  stridng ahead he used snowshoes to
break bogging drifts for sled-passage
short-lived arctic daylight glared across
the blurring wastes the huskies floundered
and had to be stopped for a breather once
an outfit slurred close to a deep ice-chasm
a husky was pinned under the runners
its belly slit the crees didnt like the
job but nobody wasted time on words
they used a - and cut the dead
animal from the traces

  the sleds ground on skirted the eastern
rim of chandindu post a few of the
squaws stood by the grove watching the
sled that carried mornas body cut out
heading for the compound the rest kept
going

  the trail didnt get better north of the
post the barrens sprawled deceptively
level pocked with hidden pits through
blinding snow the crees drove forward it
was easier in the spruce grove high
clashing branches flawed the wind the
teams hauled through dead-silent pockets
cody had drawn a winchester from the
fur-lined boot strapped to the lead-sled he
made a sign indians hove back on poles
braking the dogs even before they came
to the north lip of the stand they could
hear the bellow of the fire

  the steep cliff-grade was dotted with
the calicos prints halfway up a figure
lay spreadeagled black against the snow a
rifle flung clear of its clutching hand
jessup had a broken dead look

  at codys side beth stifled a low cry
he followed her stare the indians had
seen it too on the deep jutting cliffledge
the cabin was a mass of frantic licking
flames black smoke billowed up against
the bloodred glow of the sky freeze-
rotten timbers were already groaning sag-
ging forward on the ledge and ice-boulders
slagged away crashing down to shatter on
the jagged rocks of the valley but more
than the fire held their attention they

could see brando outlined very clearly
against its rising roaring torch

  he stood straight facing the grove his
legs wide set the wind tearing at his
clothes and hair the winchester was
levelled for action one of the crees
made a deep angry sound in his chest and
stepped into the open the winchester
arched up and flashed back splintered from
one of the tree trunks just above the
indians head the cree didnt go any far-
ther another brave cranked his own rifle
drew bead softly cody said hold your
fire the indian obeyed cody started
forward beth touched his sleeves his
hand covered hers its all right he
said he turned to face the cliff

  the heavy cabin roof was crumbling
slowly threatening to cave a charred
loosened timber rolled free thundered over
the rim dragging snow and dislodged
rocks in its wake on the ledge brando
raised his gun codys voice was clear and
carrying

  youre coming down brando

  the winchester took aim breath caught
in beths throat she saw the yellow dart
of fire and heard the bitter singing of the
bullet codys shoulder jolted twisting him
to one side snow whirled on the valley
wind cody kept walking his tone didnt
change

  youre coming down brando you
hear me

  the cabin inferno belched black smoke
roof-joists sagged and jarred foundations
shuddered

  you havent got a chance brando
when that roof goes so does the ledge
come down or be buried in an avalanche
the rifle hammered again a wave of
snow billowed near codys foot then they
heard a crazy sound laughter shied across
the rising growl of the flames high hys-
terical laughter

  come and get me glory-boy didnt
i tell you some people can grub in the
valley that was never for me it was all
the way right from the start everything
or nothing it lifted on a ragged scream
hear that morna  i told them wed make
it top of the mountain

  the laughter was swallowed by the last
rolling updraught of flames eaten timbers
screeched and bellied grinding forward


northwest romances

the jutting ledge tore loose at one side
and pitched crazily brando wheeled mak-
ing a try for solid ground it didnt work
beth screamed once huge flaming logs
lunged into space dragging tons of loose
icerocks and snow brando was directly
under them nothing could have lived
through it

  slowly the wild thunder rolled away
across valley tundras the snow-slide
grumbled and settled in white clouds drift-
ing down like dust a few small boulders
teetered and came to rest in the end
there was only the soughing of the wind

  cody walked back to the grove none
of the crees spoke he put his good arm
around beth she touched his shoulder and
he winced then smiled its all right he
said everythings all right now she
came against him holding close as if she
would never let go

  after a time the indians moved they
talked then quickly with a growing real-
ization of hope in their eyes that turned
to cody they wheeled the sleds and
mushed the teams loudly one of them

laughed it was a good sound

 cody and beth walked to the lead sled
 tantlak faced him dark eyes questioning
 there will be a new leader at chan-
 dindu

 cody did not smile his gaze turned to
 the cliff slow and thoughtful

once i told a chechako-powers a
disease it takes root and grows and eats
inside it can twist a man

the cree chief shook his head not
all men

 cody didnt answer

he turned to the sled and tucked the
fur rugs close about beth for a moment
her fingers pressed his

 not all men she said gently

 he smiled then swung to the lead dog
 the haw of his voice was clear and
 strong the sleds headed south nobody
 looked back

 the snow fell

 on the shattered crest of the cliff black
 beaten fragments of brandos cache still
 smouldered but the wilderness air was
 clean and good in the valley

pampering the
whale

  whaling in the strait between alaska and
siberia is a rather prosaic business in
which the modern whaling gun is used even
by the eskimos but as recently as forty
years ago the iatives invested their spring
whaling operations with considerable se-
crecy and ceremony about the last of april
a long lead would open up in the ice off
pt hope alaska along this stretch of
water the bowhead ivould make its way to
the arctic ocean

  the men of the village would go out to
the edge of the land-fast ice poise their
skin-covered umiaks above the water ready
to be launched at a moments notice and
lay out their lances of slate or jade each
man wore some mystic sign or image usu-
ally the oomalik captain owned the boat
and since he usually had more wives than
he knew what to do with tradition author-
ised the harpoooer the most important
man in the boat to choose any one of them
for his companion on the night before the
hunt was to begin for the medicine man
assured them whales preferred to be killed
by a man who had just left the bed of the
lady of his choicei

useful umiak

  the eskimo umiak is usually thirty feet
long and comes to a point at each end the
frame is made of driftwood and the pieces
are lashed together with walrus-hide thongs
the skins walrus bearded seal or killi-
luak are carefully stretched and double-
stitched with  sinew to make them abso-
lutely water-tight

  this boat can be sailed paddled or
towed when eskimos travel around the
shore-line of a lake or along a sandy beach
they hitch their dogs to a tow-line and sit
back while the dogs do the work

  an umiak will hold thirty people or a
ton of freight it is so light that it can be
carried across an ice field by four men-or
hauled on a sledge by a team of six dogs
it can bump into heavy ice without being
stove in as a wooden whale-boat surely
would be and it can be paddled through
thin nczvly-farmed ice without having holes
worn in the sheathing-something that can-
not be done ivith a whale-boat sent head-
on into an ice floe the umiak will bounce
back like a rubber ball and if you do
break a rib or punch a hole in the skin
covering they can be repaired as easily as
you replace the rib in an umbrella or patch
a pair of pants

oure a chump dizzy izzy
courting me i can pick you up
with one hand you five foot
nincompoop katys voice whirred like
the turbine at ballycop falls

  but katy dear im crazy about you
youre so tall and forceful dizzy ran his
slim little fingers delicately along her mus-
cular arm they sat watching the roaring
blaze in the puddingstone fireplace of katys
golden goose saloon it was one of those
rare lulls in an evenings business when
her pint-sized suitor could get a word
in edgewise

  throw more pine needles on the fire
ordered katy the place stinks of to-
bacco

  you never minded the whiskey did
you katy youre what i need a big
lusty wife to take care of me

  i wont wash your diapers anyway
pm a rawboned horse when the stork
brought me he forgot my hips the lazy
old bird threw in an extra set of muscles
instead of going back after them sure
i didnt need em now managed to make
my pile without em but that dont make
me no charmer




northwest romances

  she glanced at the cracked bar-mirror
behind the counter to her right the face
that stared back at her from under coarse
black hair was a healthy looking one and
it still showed traces of youthful vigor
but it was oh so homely those cheek-
bones pushing through its tanned skinni-
ness reminded her of those of an indian
squaw the thin lips between the heavy
set jaw and broad nose opened to speak
and katy heard herself saying what
you want is my money

  dizzys mouth sagged until it was higher
than it was wide youre dead wrong
katy he appraised her with his snap-
ping indigo eyes beady little eyes like
those of a turtle no katy you dont
understand you attract me just the way
you are

  this passion of his in size  shoes
with her broad shoulders and wiry body
was an amazon as she sat beside him
on the split log bench before the fire
even dizzy had to admit that the graces
had bypassed the lady proprietor of the
golden goose

  but he loved her large mouth the
shrewd blue eyes under her shaggy brows
and her spirit of comradery her very
size and might answered the deep longing
of his soul we so often mate by oppo-
sites

  if i ever parked my six foot carcass
on your lap dizzy id crush that moaning
mooncalf out of you youre after money
and you wont get it so stop your apple
polishing and scat

  but cross my heart i love you katy
dizzys shrill voice screeched with the
earnestness of his conviction as he sol-
emnly crossed his left breast your
money has nothing to do with it

  do you know dizzy i wish i could
take an oilcan to that throat of yours
sometimes you get on my nerves

 katy crossed her arms where her
breasts should have been and faced him
with distain all right little lad if you
dont want money then show me the
color of yours to prove it

 but katy you know im broke
wailed dizzy his sharp little features look-
ing as if he wanted to cry he pulled his
pockets inside out to prove it

  sure and broke youll stay a fine
husband youd make katy stood up

to wait on the customer who was pushing
through the swinging doors a whiff of
crisp spring air puffed in his wake

  hello jake hows luck she in-
quired

  as dizzy slipped out of the saloon un-
sped by any cheery word of good-night
he glanced at the full moon in the sky
about it was a rainbow ring he recalled
that it was an important omen but he
couldnt remember whether it was for
good or bad

  why has lady luck always over-
looked me  he wondered perhaps im so
tiny she cant see me he may have been
right too life is hard on the frontier
when one is on the wrong side of five
feet even the unruly pompadour of curly
hair that grew straight up from his scalp
couldnt snitch enough height from fate
to put him in the five foot class that held
all average men the miners treated him
like a puppy

  on the other hand when katy opened
the golden goose the golddust from the
ballycop mines came knocking at her
door begging to be melted into fiery
hot liquor she never refused to grubstake
a miner after she had cleaned him out
instead she sent him out into the hills
again on shares she had become co-
owner of more than one rich mine

katrinka had even grubstaked dizzy
on his first venture he had re-
turned complaining sorrowfully that other
men had cleaned him out she didnt out-
fit him again not because she didnt trust
him but because he was too small to be
useful

  how it happened no one could guess
but dizzy fell in love with katy that
dark giantess who some hinted bore the
legal name gwendolyn however it would
have been sissy to call miss katrinka gor-
don that

  katrinka couldnt believe her ears when
he told her it was positively ludicrous
to have such a puppet for a lover no
wonder she put it down as his bid for
a soft berth and-easy money

  katys ultimatum left dizzy no alter-
native but to make money and the only
way in these mountains was to find a
gold mine katrinka had cornered other
profitable business with more resolve
rainbows end



than his neighbors along the ballycop
river would have expected he laid his
plans

  hed have to win his pile against katys
opposition she was that kind shed test
her man to the limit before shed con-
sider him but that didnt phase dizzy
like many small folk he had ample vanity
as compensation

  there were miners all about the settle-
ment some were in town some camped
just beyond it not one of them would
have grubstaked dizzy knowingly yet
there is something in human nature that
yields to the importunity of a buzzing
fly of a beggar just to be rid of him

  dizzy visited each miners cabin with
some trifling request perhaps for a can
of beans or for a slice of bacon

  please may i have that womdown
shovel 

  you wont want that frying pan with
the broken handle

  his victims fell to the attack dizzy
found a complete grubstake when he cat-
alogued his loot and he had bartered no
share of his enterprise to get it

  but no one had volunteered to give away
a mule so dizzy would have to tote his
own burdens hed have to prospect near
home this was much-tramped territory
prospected since early goldrush days itd
be hard to hit the jackpot that is unless
he contrived to beat the game

  dizzy dropped in at the mining claims
registry office asking to see the books
ike martin the grizzled old clerk whose
smile was usually warm with friendliness
gave him a hard look

  ye aint thinking of claim jumpin be
yer diz

  distaining to reply dizzy scrutinized
the many entries among them were some
rich and famous mines here was katys
own poverty alley the mine that had
started her on her road to riches shoot-
ing star had waved a golden fortune un-
der the noses of three partners intoxi-
cating them with its heady wine of riches
until they battled to the finish their final
location notice was on a wooden head-
board large enough for three in the hill-
side graveyard back of town

  however more than half the entries
had never proved out they were just

-northwest romances-winter

the rush of timid prospectors to protect
half explored mistakes coupling miners
gossip with failure to report each years
assessment work on the property dizzy
proceeded to eliminate these claims they
were no good

  he was looking for that rare oppor-
tunity for profit where a prospector had
discovered what looked like a good mine
had filed on it leaving the description of
his claim here in the record office-then
had neglected to develop his claim to the
extent required under the mining laws
to hold it

  sometimes unhappy things happen to
miners they get into fights someone
gets hurt maybe killed men get run out
of town put in jail sometimes men just
die maybe that leaves a rich mine up
in the hills without an owner or a newly
filed claim without the exploration tunnel
completed on it to show how rich it is

  dizzy was hoping against hope for some
such piece of luck he might hit some-
thing good by refiling on a likely property
other men had although it was a dan-
gerous practice the former owners ob-
jected when they returned to town or
got out of jail to having their property
taken over by new management it was
all perfectly legal however and dizzy
felt virtuous

  the mining property held by gwen-
dolyn katrinka gordon by assignment
from andrew johnson in payment of a
whiskey debt finally held his attention
dizzy recalled old andy he had hung
around the golden goose a couple of
years back katy had apparently accepted
this undeveloped mine of his to settle up
his bill at the time he left town there
might have been something to his mine
andy had been an erratic sort of man
he would work himself sick out in the
hills finally come into town to recover
then he would drink himself silly get
morbid chuck whatever he had been up
to and start all over again

  the fact that a fellow like andy hadnt
returned to his mine didnt mean it wasnt
any good also katy hadnt troubled to
take care of the assessment work uncle
sam requires a yearly effort to expand
and improve a mine to prove its owners
interest in it otherwise a mining claim
lapses leaving the property open to re-

filing

  old ike went out while dizzy was en-
grossed in his reading he returned
bringing katrinka with him her face
flushed as she confronted dizzy he
couldnt tell whether with excitement or
anger

  thinking of claim jumpin you little
squirt cant get my money one way so
youre scheming to get it another which
claim do you figure to jump smarty-
pants 

 wouldnt you like to know my
sweet its all fair and legal if you
want to keep your claims seems like you
should keep them legal

  i dont know about that retorted
katy some of em aint worth the ex-
pense of the yearly digging ive got a
lot of claims to hold but if i catch you
monkeying with any one of em ill send
a slug into the seat of your claim-hoppin
pants

  as katy was a dead sure shot this
argument may even have borne more
weight than the law in the vicinity of
ballycop but dizzy was a nervy little
chap given half a chance

the night was warmly humid in
the light of the full moon it was
already late about  am when a man
came walking carefully along aspen
creek a rippling little stream tributary
to the ballycop and leading up into the
high ranges

  the sharply outlined moonshadows hid
pitfalls beneath their blackness ankle
breaking holes left by rotted stumps
along the streambank toe-catching cross-
trail creepers deep narrow gullies cut
by the recent spring run-off

  the man cast a little shadow like that
of a doll a very dumpy doll broader
than he was long who skipped along the
trail with more liveliness than life

  perhaps half a mile behind strode a
taller figure restraining its customary
rapid gait with difficulty the tall one
carried a rifle under her arm it was
katrinka stalking her little suitor

  dizzy had left town shortly before
dark to locate katys johnson claim from
its brief description in ikes records he
thought he could find it easily because
of its reference to aspen creek par-

ticularly to the spot where it cut rapids
through a narrow gorge between beetle-
browed cliffs the exact spot being marked
by a slanting vein in the face of the
cliff it seemed impossible to miss

  he had shoved a couple of sandwiches
into his pockets and concealed his rock-
hammer in his shirt before sauntering out
of town with such obvious casualness as
to allay suspicion

  katyll sure be furious if she catches
on he thought but it didnt seem she
had he waited concealed in the brush
beside the trail just beyond town for a
full half hour to make certain that no
one intended to follow him then he had
zigzagged double-tracked and looped
taking every precaution to conceal his
intention of hiking up aspen creek

  katy might have been fooled tonight
except that she had kept watch over the
little one ever since she had caught him
in the registry office

  two minutes after dizzy hit the trail
her informer rushed into the golden goose
with the news she might have sicked
willing henchmen on the little rascal but
she did nothing of the sort she would
pursue him herself she liked to fight
her own battles

  a good tracker like katy didnt need
to rush after dizzy she gave him plenty
of time to strike out where he was really
going she was careful not to approach too
close for once he found her on his trail
he would head for home without showing
his hand

  then dizzy pulled his final trick he
dropped down from its aspen wooded
banks to walk in the creekbed where the
water flowed over a flat slab of rock
looking reddish beneath the swiftly flow-
ing current it was flanked by a thick
grove of small quaking aspen trees their
leaves still green and small with the first
rush of new growth these trees filled
the tight little vale between the rounding
shaley walls of the canyon of the stream
at this point

  dizzy broke a small branch from the
greenish white trunk of a tree overhang-
ing the water it snapped with a brittle
sound he left it swinging still suspended
by a slender thread of bark from the
trunk of the tree this was his way of
drawing a red herring across the trail
rainbows end	

as the saying goes no tracker could help
but see it

  he dropped his rock hammer and two
sandwiches on a log on the streambank
while he completed his deception to ac-
complish this he swung up into the bran-
ches the slender trunk would never have
carried a full weight tarzan but it held
dizzy readily enough

  he swung monkey-fashion from tree
to tree across the little forest for fifty
feet or so until he reached the shale clut-
tered hillside as he went every now and
then hed drop a leaf or break a twig
just enough to disclose to a prying eye
that someone had climbed through the
trees finally he dropped to the ground
among the rocks of the hillside to leave
an obvious trail up the slope

  this delaying action completed he back-
tracked through the branches once again
to aspen creek where he picked up his
hammer and his lunch and went on up-
stream anyone following his trail would
have to stop to investigate this possible
switch in direction even if the tracker
mistrusted it that would absorb time and
time was all he needed but dizzy did
not give enough credit to the depths of
katys perception

  if katy had been tracking a man to an
unknown destination when she arrived
at the rock-slab she might have been
fooled but by now she knew that dizzy
was heading toward her johnson quartz
claim after all he had to there was
no other place he could go from here
she chuckled at the thought of dizzy dis-
porting himself in the trees more like a
chump than a chimp if hed only had a
tail she concluded he might a made a
respectable monkey

  she tried to recall the details of the
johnson claim she had visited it two
years ago just as she did all her mining
ventures there hadnt been much work
done on that quartz vein the only good
thing she remembered of it was the beau-
tiful sunset on the cliff face

  all that dizzy would ever get out of
the johnson claim would be trouble she
thought and his troubles would start this
evening if he insisted on going through
with his plans claim-hoppins a mighty
bad thing to encourage in these mountains
she decided as she fingered her rifle

eanwhile dizzy was toying
with his rock hammer as he con-
tinued upstream it had a long slender
handle light for carrying and a very
sharp point curved to pick out rock he
wondered if hed be picking out any rich
ore samples tonight

  presently he recognized the landmarks
flanking cliffs topping the foliage that
embraced the little sparkling rapids the
whole a moonlit diamond gateway to the
high mountain regions beyond

  but he was not to be waylaid by visions
of mountain beauty swinging abruptly
away from the stream he ascended the
western hill a mass of broken slabs and
shale at the base of the cliff to the left
the grade pulled at his lungs as he climbed
straight uphill

  with five minutes vigorous effort dizzy
topped the rise arriving at the base of
the cliff he paused to ease his straining
lungs

  nature checked closely with the re-
corded description behind and below
roared the rapids of aspen creek across
the stream rose the companion landmark
cliff the vertical wall of the cliff he
stood beneath was marked by the slanting
undercut vein he had to be right he
thought

  yet he lingered studying the twinkling
thread of silver that rippled below him
he wanted to make certain that no one had
pursued him up aspen creek he saw no
indication of movement in the moist little
vale of the stream the brush grew green
and rank making observation difficult

  but finally satisfied dizzy turned to
the cliff whose brow protruded above him
towering a distance of some three hundred
feet he advanced along its flank exam-
ining its shadows at close hand

  the rock mass angled to the right
revealing a natural pathway up the under-
cut vein across the surface of the cliff
the bright unobstructed moonlight at this
point gave it the effect of an etching in
the rock

  the cutting winds of time had scraped
this foothold into the granite sandwich of
the crag yet they had not overdone their
labors there was barely width for tiny
dizzy to claw his way along the slope
on hands and knees

  by throwing his weight inward away


northwest romances

from the precipice and steadying himself
at times by the rock that shelved out both
above and below him for about eighteen
inches of foothold he crawled along the
narrow slot in the vein leading some-
times gently sometimes steeply up the
face of the cliff

  the perils of the ascent would have ter-
rified most men but dizy had never been
afraid of height he kept good control
over himself not looking down to the
depths of space below him but up toward
his goal a fault plane in the cliff where
his gold would lie if anywhere at all in
this eerie spot

  he brought his hammer into use test-
ing the solidity of the weathered rock
along the ledge presently his efforts
brought him to the end of the slot two
hundred feet in the air where the vertical
fault plane in the granite cliff had abruptly
sheered it off

  the fault at this point was about five
feet wide and filled with an outcropping
of white quartz below him long before
reaching the ground the fault pinched off
into a mere crack in the granite prospect-
ing from below might not have shown it

  now that dizzy thought about it his
ascent of this slot in the cliff hardly more
than a mere scratch on the face of na-
ture was about as crazy as trying to
climb a rainbow in the sky the question
now was had he discovered the pot of
gold at the end of it

  even the surface of the quartz was
hard he hammered off as many of the
small projecting lumps as he could several
of the chips bounced over the face of the
cliff as he hammered his blows resounded
with telltale sharpness in the night air

he was much too busy to notice
katy emerge from the creek bed
to approach the rock face katy with her
gun in her right hand she passed beneath
dizzys perch stopping to examine the
chips falling from his blows she walked
three hundred or so paces further along
the cliff and toyed with the loose rocks
there retracing her steps she paused
again in the shadows standing just south
of the vein and hidden in the darkness
she looked up and watched him intently
finally she disappeared westward into the
night

  dizzy halted in his hammering to study
the little pile of rock chips on the ledge
in all of them were large yellow particles
of gold he had found the hoped-for pot
of gold at the end of his rainbow he de-
cided that he would christen his discovery
the rainbow road

  wont folks be excited when i tell em
about this he thought in high glee it
was the biggest moment of his life
perched as he was two hundred feet up
in the air with what seemed like all the
gold in the world right beside his elbow

  he took a folded sugar bag from his
breast pocket and filled it with samples
of the ore these he stuffed back into
his pocket to think that johnson the old
guzzler had traded off a bonanza like
this for the price of a few drinks

  dizzy backed down the trail rubbing his
hammer handle across the ledge as he
went to erase his tracks he certainty
didnt want anyone to discover his rain-
bow road at this point now he must get
the location safely refiled on at ike mar-
tins office

  just beyond the point at which he had
commenced to climb the vein he was
startled to find a three foot monument
of loosely piled rocks then he recalled
that of course johnson had to build
monuments on his claim i should have
expected to find them he thought for-
tunately they were in good condition itll
save me spending the rest of the night
building them he had barely time to
return to ballycop falls before ike opened
up

  he bent over the monument and found
a tobacco can with a claim paper in it
this is johnsons work remember he
used to smoke that kind of tobacco too
he decided to add his own notice of lo-
cation to it after he had replaced the
can in the monument he hightailed it for
home

  when ike martin opened his office door
at  that morning the first citizen of
the town to greet him was dizzy izzy
isadore dizzy swiftly accomplished his
legal business refiling the original john-
son notice changing only name and date
exact duplication seemed to tie up his
ownership clearly to that known location
when he had finished- his new wealth
seemed safe
rainbows end

  by noon every ballycoptian had heard
the news little dizzy izzy had refiled
on the johnson claim and the ore sam-
ples from his land had proved to be the
richest ever tested in the assay office
what was that high-fallutin name
dizzy had rechristened the old johnson
claim oh yes the rainbow road

  within the hour every curious rider
who could borrow a horse was on his
way out to look over this old johnson
property meanwhile dizzy dropped into
the golden goose to call on katrinka
and to press his courtship

  with the joy that only love can lend
he told of his discovery and consequently
the fulfillment of her demand for success
and wealth on his part he again asked her
to marry him

  lets wait a little longer dizzy until
were sure

  what do you mean sure he de-
manded the cocky little man of sudden
wealth was surprised i could have a
thousand women now he told himself
yet katy puts me off still those gals
wouldnt be like her though he de-
cided to le magnanimous and wait a little
longer for her to be reasonable

  katrinka would give him no explanation
wait and see was all she would say

  late in the afternoon the horsemen
returned from their trip to the johnson
mine they had carefully followed the
original description of the property the
one which dizzy had refiled in his own
name that morning they stomped into
the golden goose nearly slamming the
doors off their hinges to confront little
dizzy

  if you were only heavy enough to
tighten a rope wed string you from hang-
mans tree said the larger man who
acted as spokesman

  whats the matter boys inquired
supercilious dizzy he was remembering
his wealth and tried hard not to quiver
from mere force of habit

  theres no gold on that johnson claim
that you swiped from katy here whered
you get that rich quartz you pretended
came from there his tormenter de-
manded

  and whats that to you men de-
manded katy coming around the end of
her crude oak bar with the menacing air



of a mastiff protecting her puppies you
certainly dont own it in any case that is
unless you had thought of jumping it to-
day yourselves

  that could-a been mum admitted
the oldest among the men apologetically
he had learned from experience to tell
only the truth in the vicinity of the golden
goose

  mebbe you didnt know already went
on katy that old man johnson faked
that claim he gave me just to wheedle me
out of a few drinks there never was any-
thing to it and i knew it only i felt sorry
for the poor mutt

  the men were silent they could prac-
tically hear the air escaping from dizzys
punctured balloon katy turned to her be-
wildered little suitor and laughed

  as for you little one she commenced
you didnt ever even set foot on the
johnson claim that you refiled on this
morning

  i cant believe it insisted dizzy the
creek the path the cliff the vein every-
thing matched johnsons description i was
there i know i was there

  mind answering a question then little
one

  of course i dont mind snapped the
possessor of uncertain wealth he was try-
ing to cover his confusion by a sign of ir-
ritation

  when you arrived at the rapids on
aspen creek toward which shoulder of
the gorge did you turn

  i turned left toward the west cliff

  and you men katy turned to the
restless group of disgruntled riders lined
up before her bar you just tell me now
how you went following dizzys copy of
the old johnson claim just as he refiled it
this morning

  we went east stated the older man
yeh we went right every man agreed
thats the way the notice in ikes book
said

  could it be that you have made a mis-
take mr isadore inquired katrinka
with mock politeness and you trying so
hard last night to put something over on
me 

  great guns katy exclaimed the
startled dizzy at last comprehending what
he had done i discovered a fortune on
once claim and filed on another i dont


northwest romances

want that johnson claim at all mines on
the west side

  so at last youve figured it out com-
mented katy the drinks are on the
house boys but katys invitation cost
her nothing once dizzy had let the cat
out of the bag everylxidy dashed out the
door after the little minerjin a race to be
first at ikes office windcv to file on a
slice of the bonanza so suddenly revealed
to be without an owner

  a score of men had run out after
dizzy men with longer legs he arrived
last of all at ikes office winodw as he
stood last in line he thought what a fool
he had been to make such a stupid botch
of the biggest opportunity of his life

  of course you fellows know ike ad-
dressed the crowd that a man cant prop-
erly meet the law until he has first posted
his notice of location on the property
itself marking the boundaries of his claim
with the proer monuments then is the
time to make your entry at the registry of
mining claims

  he knitted his brows at the man attempt-
ing to scrawl out a notice at the office
wicket im sorry abe but you and every-
one else will have to follow the rules
courts wouldnt hold with tryin to do
things backwards like you jibberin mag-
pies are doing here might take a lifetime
of investigating to determine who had the
legal claim nobodyd benefit by that

  he put the squeaky official pen and its
bottle of muddy ink under the counter to
emphasize his stand in the matter tell
you what his face brightened you fel-
lows could always go out there and shoot
it out he slammed down the window

  the goldrush was on although it was
late in the day every man who had been
at ikes office grabbed himself the first
nag he came to and hightailed it out in
a wild race to see who could get his
monument up first on the real rainbow
road claim this time there wasnt much
doubt but that they all would turn west

  but poor little dizzy was out of the
running he crumpled down on the
wooden steps outside the claims office
overcome by his woes and sobbed hed
lost a fortune hed lost fame hed lost
everything but chiefly hed lost katrinka
this was the deepest hurt of all to make
a perfect fool out of himself before the
woman he loved shed never look at him
again probably wouldnt even let him in
the golden goose

  old ike martin stuck his head out the
office door quit braying and come in
here i have some news your long ears
will be interested in i didnt tell the
crowd thought the boys would like their
fun but there was an entry filed this
momin party got me out of bed she did
i was mad said i wouldnt then i ad-
mitted i would she had a gun shes
kinda nervous with her trigger finger so
that entry got in the books right early
want to see it

  no moaned dizzy nothing seemed
to matter now

  well here it is anyway ike lugged
the great thick ledger out of the office
and slammed it down on dizzys knees
now read it

  thus bidden dizzy read it was the
correct description of a claim filed on his
rainbow road somebody else had beaten
him to it not late this afternoon but
even early this morning somebody had
gotten to the office from aspen creek
before he did it seemed incredible
read the signature prompted ike
dizzy obediently read he knew what
was coming katy had beaten him to it
when hed thought all along he was out-
smarting her he read gwendolyn kat-
rinka gordon isadore

  she said twarnt no good until you
ratified it  added ike theres been a
sheriffs possee sittin on their fannies
out there all day guardin that claim fer
you two katy said therell be trouble
before sundown and made em go
what is so right about this picture

i it that dads finally retired  the old
alarm clock gagged for good

  ia it because now mom wont have to
watch him leave for the office any more
looking just a little bit tired

  or is it because now dad and mom will be
starting an especially bappy time of ufe to-
gether

by anson slaughter

the icy arctic gives bountifully to those of honest heart to those
who cozen and defile it it sets the elements against them so
proclaimed the aged gold-seeker wash tetley    and his
saga of john cottrell and the man-killer pass bore him out

nobody believed him and

you couldnt rightly blame em
men heard queer stories about
wash tetley chechakos fresh from the
outside listened to the old ones talk
through cutplug pipesmoke about weather
that froze your breath on the air and
sealskins worth a kings ransom about
snowbound cabins and gliostwolves and
pelly squaws with amber skin-and wash
tetley

  twenty years man and boy old wash
had combed white wastelands and sterile
arctic peaks for the yellow metal in
sixty-two a whisper of gold was reported
by hudsons bay company men tetley
found nothing but months of loneliness
and dead malemutes and threatening hun-
ger then in seventy-one a trek along
the rat to the headwaters of the porcu-
pine and suddenly molten sunlight glim-
mering in a creekbed he was rich  he had
money to bum and big stories to squander
but it was only skim-digging the strike
ran dry tetley got just enough out of it
to stake him on another wild goose chase
that was when wash became more than
a nickname

  back in missourah mah and pap used
to call him wash for short and down to
the settlement schoolhouse mousey miss
tolliver always spoke it out proud and
proper-like - master washington tetley
but half a lifetime made a difference up
here in north  country when someone
winked at the grizzled old buck by the bar
and said hi wash he wasnt thinking
of the father of his country he was
laughing at washout tetley the cootiest
goldbug north of fifty-three

  and they laughed that night in skag-
way the mudchinked walls of guthries
trading post flung back the echo of their
laughter and it ran along the bar and



gurgled in the tap of the rumkeg big
matt set up a fresh one and shoved it at
wash

  so you done it again you old siwash
you struck it rich again  

  its real matt this time its the
mccoy a mother lode  

  the guffaws got louder a barfly banged
one foot on the brass rail unable to quit
giggling only the tall dark-faced man at
the end of the bar did not laugh

come off it big matt said rinse
that blarney down with rotgut   
washs grey eyes burned like hot ice
he said quietly its no use talking to
a bunch of jackasses that figure gold
ought to hop into their pockets

  this is  wash the streams was
milked dry long ago sure alaska can
make a man rich a fur man   

  they roared the man at the end of
the bar set down his glass his voice was
level maybe tetleys got something
smart men would listen

  he had the hard look of a man who
could tell a mule to move on and make
the order stick eyes turned to him the
laughter dwindled

  smart wash said mister you got
these boys wrong they want it all the
easy way no hard work just spill water
through a pan and fill your poke with
dust his laugh was flat arid they
cant understand a mans got to know the
land hes got to coax her along keep her
warm shes got things to give but she
dont give for nothing

  like a female big matt said just
like a squaw eh wash

  it started all over again the chuckles
and roars in smoky stillness the kerosene
lamp swayed somebody said

  you coax the land wash ill do my
coaxing on the real thing something with
lliij




northwest romances

curves in the right places

  tetleys grip on the whiskey jigger
was taut so were the words

  i need a grubstake and a sidekick to
help me mine the stuff he looked at
the dark-faced stranger there ought to
be one man jack amongst you bright
enough to get on the bandwagon ill split
the take fifty-fifty all we got to do is
cross white pass

  is that all somebody said sourly
why not just commit suicide with a gun
its simpler

  the man at the end of the bar said
white pass is dangerous

  dangerous big matt chuckled niew
to this country aint you friend most
folks knows about the pass it s a man
killer aint nobody loco enough to use
that route to the inside cept injuns and
eagles

  wash downed his drink and stared at
the empty glass

  menve crossed her i crossed her my-
self therell be more like me and the man
killerll be good to them to the right
one shell say go on take what you
want only the wrong ones shell shut
out the lands got a feeling about right
and wrong good and bad

  mister tetley and blushing bride
alaska i

  it was a great joke the laughter was
raw in his ears and his neck felt hot he
didnt say anymore he went to a table
in a far corner and sat there alone and in
a while they forgot him and found some-
thing else to laugh at the sound of their
voices seemed far off march wind washed
in from the bering sea buffeting flurries
of snow against the oilskin cabin windows
and wash sat very still listening to the
soothing murmur of the land close and
friendly and without mockery well show
them he said aloud one of these bright
mornings

  a tall shadow fell flat across the rough-
hewn table hands set a mug and bottle
in front of him wash looked up into the
strangers slow grin he filled the glass
and drank

  go on he said thickly heehaw with
the rest of them jackasses

 the man from the bar sat down
stretched long legs and studied the blunt
tips of his mukluks

  maybe they got reason to laugh dont
seem like the discoverer of a rich lode
would have to hustle a grubstake

  wash refilled the glass the smoke of
rum had begun to haze his deep-set eyes

  let em laugh they always laugh at
men like harper and mcqueston and
me    mister i could tell you    but
whits the use youre like all the rest
the stranger leaned forward im john
cottrell i came to alaska to prospect   
im not laughing tetley im listening
wash stopped drinking his gaze held
cottrells

  i said before mister men dont rightly
know this land they figure her gold ought
to be floating free in creek and river
beds some of it was but that was just
a beginning the real paydirt lies twenty
foot down under drift from the glaciers
frozen at bedrock i wasnt funning about
keeping the land warm i had to build
fires to thaw her out i had to dig for days
but shes there hundreds of pounds at
eighteen hard dollars an ounce

  cottrells dark face was stiff the eyes
had gone bright and brittle wash finished
off his drink

  but mining takes time i ran out of
grub it was a long haul back to skagway
this mine cottrell said where is
it you made a map

  wash started to speak he didnt the
creases tightened about his eyes

  maybe thats my business he said

  it was like a slap in the teeth cottrell
straightened very slowly he stood looking
down

  i got a good packhorse and enough
dinero to stake two men you said the
deal was fifty-fifty if you dont trust
me    he shrugged turning away

  hold your horses wash stared at
his glass dont get me wrong i got to
be sure thats all i nursed this country a
long spell me and her were friends i
dont want nothing to change that no
wrong ones thatll make the pass sore at
me if my partners a wrong one that man
killers going to stop us i tell you cottrell
a country knows the ones thatll hurt her
one way or another she keeps them out
cottrell sat down again he refilled
washs glass

  but you and me shell let us through
well take this man killer in a breeze
shroud of snow



  sure wash grinned through thick-
ening whiskey mist in a breeze

  cottrells smile was cold and artificial

  wash didnt notice

everything seemed fine the horse
was a chestnut with powerful withers
and a friendly disposition john cottrell
had money enough to buy the best and
plenty of it the men at guthries post
had stopped laughing wash enjoyed the
mixture of surprise and growing thought
in their eyes he pulled the packcinch tight
around the ponys belly and looked at cott-
rell in the pallid mist of dawn the dark
face was calm and sure cottrell winked
hawing the animal on toward the marshes
and plodding alongside silently wash
whispered to the waking earth this is it
baby now well show them it was a
long time before he realized the land wasnt
answering

  a notionable wind purged down from
the blinding steep wall of the pass had
turned suddenly icy gritty blasts of snow
exploded in their faces the marshes
seemed thicker and mud clung heavy to
their mukluks and over everything lay
a dead while silence broken only by the
uneasy snuffing of the horse cottrell
pushed forward steadily he seemed not
to notice the sudden grayness of the land
wash shrugged off a shiver day-dreams
he thought why should the land turn
against him they were friends they
had lived together a mighty long time
they knew and trusted each-other still
the face of white pass glared palely at
their approach the wind was too sharp
and quiet and at noon in the last treach-
erous reaches of the marsh the horse
caved in

  the leg wasnt broken but the muscles
were strained cottrell straightened from
examining the animal

  shes hauling too much well have to
back-pack some of the stuff

  he started to unhitch the rawhide
thongs wash didnt move to help he
stood staring through silent whirling snow
at the bleakness of the pass

  i dont like it he said softly

  cottrell looked at him wash shook his
head

  she looks bad mister this here lands
got her dander up about something first

the storm to make the going harder now
the horse i tell you shes got a mind to
stop us

  the tall man laughed the ponyll be
all right and no storms going to keep me
from a fortune in dust

  i know this country cottrell i lived
with her

  cottrell faced him square the smile
was gone

  it couldnt be tliat youre welshing
could it it couldnt be that youre the
lying coot they call you

  shut up

  maybe there aint no mother lode
theyll like that when i tell them theyll
have a great big laugh

  washs mouth was a rigid line a long
minute passed finally he said

  well mush whenever youre ready
things didnt get better cottrell hauled
half the load on thickset shoulders and the
chestnut went on but she was nervous
now her eyes had bugged and the broad
chest heaved too quickly her footwork was
skittish and unsure slowly the party
moved through a tangled spruce grove to
the foot of white pass neither man
talked there was only the frozen snap of
undergrowth and the wind playing sullenly
at hide-and-seek the pony whinneyed
shrilly the evergreens thinned and then
coming into blanched naked foothills they
began the climb

  once the trail that straggled up the
mountainbelly had been covered with top-
soil but for years now indians had used
white pass as a portage quilled moc-
casins and unshod hooves had worn away
the earth coating and now the searching
foot found poor hold on jagged slippery
rock and shale the path was narrow and
steep the chestnut shied back from the
sheer lip cottrell swore prodding her on

  wash tetley said nothing his weath-
ered face squinted against rising storm-
wind had a listening expression he looked
like a man who load asked a question and
waited for an answer the land rose bare
and silent against a crepe-gray sky the
snowfall thickened and the answer did
not come maybe he was wrong maybe
the anger of the man killer was a passing
thing and the storm would let up he
told himself that but he never believed
it
	northwest

  the answer came at nightfall they
struck camp in the lee of a trail-bend
wind worried the lean-to but it kept out
the snow the horse kept shrilling at the
cold darkness silently cottrell unhitched
the pack wash ixint over the sunken pit
of dead kindling the match scraped and
he leaned forward but he did not set it
to the wood a noise stopped him cottrell
didnt speak tetley was very still before
he turned he knew what he would see
there had been a winchester in a cinch-
holster they load brought it along for
caribou only right now cottrell had
forgotten caribou the muzzle was trained
on the back of washs head

tetley stood up slowly cottrells
face wasnt pretty it was a rock face
with eyes like mountain ice he took a
step forward and the frozen mouthline
twitched he didnt get the words out
wash came in low and a knobby shoulder
dug into cottrells gut the veined fists
cut deep cottrell cursed and twisted back-
ward lie used the gunbarrel very neatly
and when it came away the lived welt
along the old mans cheek bone purpled
and needlepoints of blood pressed through
the torn flesh wash sank back against the
rock wall his voice was ragged

i knew she was right you cant fool
the land mister right from the start
she had you tagged for a wrong one i
shouldve figured she was warning me
cottrell wasnt listening

  all right he said no more eye-
wash back at the post i asked you a
question you almost answered then you
went cagey the grin was crooked you
got a map tetley i want it

  snow and wind chewed at the lean-to
the chestnut threw back its head and
screamed and the sound went out over
stony silence dying a slow death wash
shook his head

  youre day-dreaming mister there
aint no map leastways not on paper
one bent finger tapped his forehead shes
all right here

  the winchester came up again it didnt
fall walsh smiled

  thats it friend always think before
you bash a mans brains in you cant
kill me you need me

  cottrell didnt answer he went to

romances

tetleys pack even when he moved the
gun didnt lose bead cottrell swore at
the rawhide knots and then his free hand
tore through the pile of patched shirts and
drawers and cooking tins he searched
every pocket he came back to wash and
said stand up through his teeth his
hands were rough they found nothing
tetleys smile stayed in place

  like i said you need me-me and
my map in my head

  cottrells mouth worked as if the words
were hard to control

  i can handle you when we get there
  if we get there

  maybe the gun wavered maybe some
of the stiff certainty went out of cottrells
face quietly wash said

  use your head son youre risking
your hide this country dont like wrong
ones you could play it square take your
half and everything be fine but if you
steal and kill   

  and if i did play it square i guess
youd forgive and forget i guess you
wouldnt gun me now if you had a
chance

  i wont have to tetley stopped smil-
ing the landll take care of you the
man killer will kill now like a woman
they said maybe they were right

  their eyes met then and held and he
wanted to make cottrell see how it was
to find the words that told about a man
who lived with a country through forgot-
ten springs and winters and knew the
secret whisper of the wind and life in
young trees and the special smell of the
lands dead wood burning in an autumn
campfire so that in the end the country
was part of him like his breathing or the
wife he never married the land was the
good book and a loving woman put to-
gether and if you believed in her and
loved back if you gave something for
what you took she denied you nothing
but there were the wrong ones that came
to take all and give nothing and the
country knew them and hated silently and
even if you wanted to warn them they
would not understand because the love
or anger of the land wasnt words or
thoughts but a feeling that no man could
communicate

  you started to say something cottrell
said finish
shroud of snow



  wind ripped down the mountains face
snow whirled swiftly and without sound
the old voice was gentle

  not this way boy you cant walk in
without work without love cheating and
murdering and tearing the dust from her
you cant use her and throw her away
shell remember shell hit back the
pass has got ways of levelling you a
man could die in these storms he could
take a wrong turn past the peak and head
into bogs that swallow and smother his
foot could slip on rocks that look safe as
kingdomcome

  cut it

  its a long drop to them foothills
break every bone in a mans   

  the words slurred under cottrells
knuckles the two men stood still

  thats better cottrell said too softly
youll shut up now we move on at
sunup youll lead me to that claim and
no more eyewash about land and man
killers

  wash didnt answer he only stared un-
blinking finally cottrell turned and went
to his sleeping bag he muttered crazy
eyewash again and tried a laugh but
it didnt quite come off he lay huddled
in his blankets the stock of the win-
chester under his fingers and watched
tetley led down dark mountain scrub
rattled in the raking wind a drift
mounded over the unlit fire tetley slept
once in the night a sound woke him
across from him cottrell sat rigid the
rifle half-lifted to his armpit his eyes
searched the darkness beyond the bend in
the pass but there was nothing only
trackless white and the secret face of the
summit brooding over them cottrell didnt
look at the old man he lay back and pre-
tended to sleep again it was a rotten piece
of acting his grip on the winchester
didnt relax for a second

the fire made things worse before
dawn cottrell was working over
frozen kindling wash leaned against the
wall watching the snow-wind had turned
temperamental it worried a man and let
him be and then came back to worry some
more it played hell with cottrells matches
the tall man swore and tried again the
lean-to canvas flapped a sulphur tip sput-
tered and blackened stillborn tetly laughed

softly

  i told you one way or another the
land fights back

  cottrell fumbled with another match

  careful wash said in a storm
like this without fire youre a dead man

  a minute passed deliberately cottrell
closed the matchbox his liand shook

  well eat the mush cold tonight well
find a better camp in the lee

  wash didnt say no he just smiled

  they had to use mauls even then the
drift-choked gulches were hard to navigate
the horse shied and snorted its fear cott-
rell took to using a blacksnake it only
terrified the animal more wash didnt
interfere he studied cottrells dark face
the mask of certainty had gone crooked
a tic twitched under one eye and dry
lips moved as though cottrell cursed voice-
lessly cursed blinding sleet and smother-
ing wind and maybe the echo of tetleys
warning easy wash thought hes
hooked now give him play and think
plan under his boots the earth muttered
secrets he listened

  hope of a better camp was a daydream
they both knew it the trail narrowed as
it climbed and sheer wall pressed them
too near the treacherous edge there was
no lee only a shallow sterile clearing
gnawed on all sides by the elements the
fire they managed was feeble without a
word they ate and turned in wash waited

  cottrell lay on his side facing the old
man his frost-stiffened parka shadowed
the hard features maybe his eyes were
closed maybe they were open and watch-
ing his finger twitched on the rifles
triggerguard after a time gently he
snored tetley moved carefully the scrap
of paper was dirty and creased the pencil
stub worked by instinct in the dying fire-
light time and again wary eyes flicked
to cottrell then the work was finished
wash folded the paper its crackle was
like a gunshot in nighted stillness wash
fumbled with the sheath of his canteen
thrusting the paper between it and the
metal flask the noise got louder cottrell
gave a thick grunt and sat bolt upright

  what was that

  wash had moved fast but maybe not
fast enough cottrells gaze locked with
his

  tetley winked sleepily what was


northwest romances

what 

  a snapping sound like brush under-
foot or paper folded

  wash looked away he yawned and
huddled down in his blanket

  maybe me just took a swig to warm
me

  cottrells breathing was heavy and fast
maybe he said but he didnt believe
it wash could tell by the tautness of his
voice and he could feel the questioning
eyes that studied him for a long time
that night

  by sunup the pass was snowbound deep
clots hid the treachery of the rocks a man
could miss footing and drop hundreds of
feet cottrell stood at the lip of camp eye-
ing the white death-trap viciously he
broke a twig and flung it into the fire
then conscious of washs stare his face
went blank he tried to sound calm

  well stick here a couple days the
stormll let up sunll melt them drifts

  tetley mopped up bean sauce with a
crust of hardtack and drank the last of
his coffee from a tin cup he didnt look
at cottrell he picked his teeth with a
thumbnail softly he said

  the storm wont let up

  how the hell do you know it broke
harsh in cottrells throat

  for a long second tetley looked at him
a smile eased the lean grizzled face

  the man killers working mister and
she knows all the tricks stay here and
your grub and matches give out you
freeze or you starve wash shook his
head un-unh you got to go on no mat-
ter how dangerous she gets the passs
got you cottrell shes laughing at you
cant you hear

  wind screamed through the high de-
solate peaks only it wasnt wind it was
laughter that came and went and came
again shrill and mocking sweat-beads
glistened on cottrells upper lip it wasnt
because he was warm

  youre crazy he said hoarsely

  you can say that but you cant be
sure and this is just the start friend
now shes playing cat-and-mouse but in
the end comes the kill slow and round
about and painful-and too slick to side-
step

  the words made sharp separate im-
pacts like slugs from a  cottrells

mouth warped he held the gun in a vice
to still the trembling of his hand after
a time he got control of his voice

  well keep moving he said and
well get through

  the two men stared at each other the
wind laughed

tetley expected the accident it
was bound to happen nerves had
screwed up every tendon in cottrells body
he had to take it out on something the
horse couldnt fight back its strained leg
had grown steadily weaker now fear
never left the bulging black eyes it
screeched and floundered at the smallest
barrier the thin trail rose steeper with
every yard it would have taken patience
to get the animal around the last bend that
led to the summit cottrell wasnt the man
for the job

  the chestnut shied and bleated and
cottrell said you stubborn- and laid
the blacksnake across her gleaming flank
the whip was a whitehot iron against the
muscles of the strained leg the horse
reared lurching sidewise and under its
hind hooves snow slagged away cottrell
lost grip on the reins blindly forelegs
flailed the air the pony slithered toward
the edge as wash dove forward his fingers
hooked in the canteen strap hitched to the
animals bellycinch the thongs went taut
with dead weight the horses cry sounded
too human tetley would have gone over
with her if the canteen thong hadnt
snapped he stumbled back and one leg
buckled under him and then slowly very
slowly the scream of the beast died cott-
rell stared down at the broken carcass and
the pack still strapped on its back

  fool he said to the dead horse
stupid fool

  wash sat propped against the naked
wall he touched his ankle carefully cott-
ell looked at him

  get up

  maybe he could have he didnt he

said

  i wont go far with this leg

  cottrells eyes narrowed the tic in his
cheek jumped tetley smiled

  piling up on you aint it friend  first
the storm then the pony gone with half
the grub and supplies now a cripple on
your hands

out of bounds

  fridtjof nansen the famous arctic ex-
plorer reported having seen a walrus on
the ice in lat   n and long 
 e approximately  miles from the
north pole and  miles from the nearest
land since the arctic ocean is more than
two miles deep at that point and the chief
food of the walrus is clams which they
dig with their tusks from comparatively
shallow water it can only be assumed that
the ungainly beast was hemmed in by a
series of pressure ridges while he slept on
an ice floe that he was unable thereafter
to reach the edge of the ice field and throw
himself into the water and was being
carried on the ice across the top of the
world

  the tall man didnt say anything he
still held the winchester washs voice
stayed cool careful

  youre in a sweet spot you cant stick
here grubd run out the freezed get
you you cant backtrack to skagway with
me alive and kicking i know too much
cottrell came a step nearer the rifle
lifted

  and you cant kill me and go on alone
remember no map

  the breech clicked open deliberately
cottrell loaded the chambers and snapped
it shut the wall felt hard and cold cutting
into tetleys spine you done it he told
himself you overplayed it the gun-
muzzle was close cottrell said quietly
youre wrong i can go on from here
alone the grin was too stiff funny
thing happened when the horse went over
you almost got killed trying to save that
canteen

  the snow fell soundlessly momentarily
the wind had stilled

  wash said maybe i got a soft spot
for rum

  thats good pop youre a real come-
dian ill take the map now

  wash sat still his fist held tight to the
canteen strap

  i keep telling you there aint no map
the rifle nudged his chest he could
hear cottrell breahing

  im tired of games tetley no man
trusts a gold location to memoiy you
was writing on paper last night you aint
the diary-keeping kind you hid the paper
a man dont risk his skin to save a swig

basket weavers

  when the western aleutians were over-
run by the japanese early in world war
ii attu was the first island to be captured
previously the attu natives had woven the
most beautiful baskets in the entire terri-
tory they were fortunate in having a type
of grass on the island better adapted for
basket making than the grass that grozvs
farther eastward along the chain and
in and out among the very fine straw they
wove strands of richly-colored silk

  the largest and most ornate basket ever
woven by these aleuts was made especially
for miss helen gould more than forty
years ago to show their appreciation of her
generosity in sending food when they were
badly in need of it some of the most ex-
pert weavers on the island worked months
in making this museum piece

of rotgut but a map

  they both moved at onec cottrells fin-
gers closed on the canteen and wash
rolled to one side yanking the thong he
didnt see the knee coming it caught him
in the chest and slammed him back against
jagged stone and wind pushed out through
his gaping mouth he let go of the canteen
strap cottrell backed away three steps
without lowering the rifle his free hand
worked on the flask sweat stood out under
his eyes as he tore at the covering and
then the canteen fell the whiskey bubbling
hot and russet on the snow and cottrell
didnt notice because he had the map

  it was old paper and soiled with smeared
pencil lines a dotted line crawled up
white pass to the summit and just be-
yond turned west and north across flat
wastes to a creek marked with a circled
cross the laugh was low in cottrells
chest his eyes had got too bright

  x marks the spot eh pop

  tetley kept quiet he didnt like the
finger that itched on the winchesters
trigger and the way cottrell came toward
him slow and ramrod-stiff he waited for
the upswing of the muzzle the dark eye
that stared incuriously an instant and
then the burning blindness of the shot   
it didnt come above him cottrells voice
was edged

  so the lands against me dont look
that way now does it it was your lady-
friend gave me this hunk of paper i
the horse hadnt slipped i wouldnt have
guessed where it was hid

caribou crowd

     caribou occur in large bands that range
   over arctic canada and much of northern
   alaska both males and females grow
   horns which they shed once a year during
   the late winter new antlers begin to grow
   early in the spring during their summer
   and fall migrations the caribou congregate
   in such numbers that a hundred thousand
   may be seen in a single day from a given
   point

   washs gaze stayed on the gun a note
of gentleness that was almost pity touched
the words

  im warning you son so far shes
toyed with you go on with this and itll
be the end the man-killers tricky she
coaxes you on till its too late to turn
back you cant do it if you gun me  

  one eyebrow twitched upward

   aint i told you i give up the notion
of using a gun its too crude no this
land of yoursll do the job for me a man
cant travel on a bad leg and he cant
live without food and matches i keep
going you    you wait men say you
get sleepy after a spell the freeze creeps
up someday maybe theyll find you see
how it works pop nice and clean no
dirt on my hands just an old coot and
his loving land that killed him

   wash didnt blink he should be smart
now he should shut up only he had to
make one more try

   you cant fool her cottrell youre the
wrong one and youre the one shell get
dont be a jackass chechako play it
straight while youre still breathing if you
follow that map  

the slap was hard it left pale
finger-stripes on tetleys face cott-
rell kept smiling as he hefted the pack to
his shoulders and moved off along the
trail to the gray trough that cut west be-
yond the mountains peak once he stopped
and looked back the smile was still in
place it wasnt nice to see

  tetley sat without moving and in the
narrow canyon of the pass a fresh wind
rose wild and echoing sleet ripped in from
the north and under the storm there was

   this sudden suspension of sound so that
it seemed as if the land paused and
waited like a cat and finally the cry came
it lifted above the wind and richocheted
against glistening rocks then quickly
it was shut off and tetley knew the bogs
had won the bottomless mudpits that
looked like solid footing until a mans
weight broke the frozen crust until the
earth sucked him down swallowing and
smothering   

  the old man didnt smile in the stillness
his lips moved maybe it was a prayer he
whispered or maybe he spoke then to
the land and the wind softened and he
knew the land understood she knew how
a man had to help sometimes how he
had to nag and taunt until nerves were
raw and the wrong one had nothing left
but suspicion and gold-fever and was ripe
to fall for tricks like a game leg and a
false map that led through the summit
of white pass and west-and the bogs
you could try to stop a man you could
want to make him see the wrongness in
him but in the end he did the choosing
the battle was between him and the land
that hated him

  the backtrail wasnt easy wash moved
slowly though he could use the leg
miles of downgrade slippery rocks didnt
help strained muscles he fell and crusted
ice cut his hands hunger weakened him
but the storm had slowed and died in the
mountains and the march wind at his
back had gentled with coming spring
when he made skagway he wasnt pretty
to look at but he was alive

  big matt and the boys at guthries
post listened to the story of john cottrell
they watched the circuit doctor bandage
washs swollen ankle and the thought of
the man killer was in their eyes and they
didnt laugh

  but they still kidded wash tetley about
his gold-claim in the early summer they
saw him head north to white pass again
and maybe some among them felt the
green promise of the land that rolled out
under his feet but nobody really believed
that the land that killed could love and
give it was nearly a year before they
learned how right he was about his strike

 qhost river

by tom oneill

  eerie echoing laughter haunted pehays chippewayans fear-hud-
  dled in their huts they slowly starved until carnes of the mounted
  mushed a ghost atrol bent on blasting that dread river phantom

whoo-oo ou-oo-o ee-o

out in the northern night a bel-
low of maniac hooting boomed
through the dense blackness of the spruce
woods echoing along the forlorn shores of
powistic river

  the weird cry rang out again and again
at it the four-footed prowlers stalking
each other through the forests matted
jungles halted momentarily eyes gleamed
in the murk ears flickered back to that
sound whose note carried menace in its
tones for all the dwellers of the barren
lands

  whoo-oo ou-oo-o over and over

  the cry floated down to a score of tee-
pees close to a lopsided cabin that sat clear
of the timber and beside the rivers glim-
mering waters under the new moons rays
the native dwellings stood out as whitish-
brown blurs against the forests gloom

  but now the hunting lodges were de-
serted and all pehays chippewayans
crowded the cabin they huddled together
on the earthen floor whites of eyes m fear

-northwest romances-winter

every ear attuned to the approaching
marauder

  oh pchay great one dost thou hear
anything a womans low voice whined
in the gloom at it the eyes rolled again

  there was no answer some of the
children crept closer to the women there
was an uneasy stirring among the half-
starved huskies tied up in a corner

  again the squaw began her query oh
pehay great- the rest of the sentence
trailed off into nothingness a soundless
shiver ran through the natives

  once more that jeering laughter from
the woods came distinct and clear on the
night air it was something akin to the
snow-owls hooting or the grunting of a
startled grizzly but possessing a strangely
terrifying note hard to fathom

  the chippewayans squatted in fearful
expectant silence again the cry came from
the forest closer now

  still the indians waited petrified mounds
of shadow in the cabins funereal black-
ness in a moment their death-like patience
was rewarded  a scratching came


	northwest romances

from outside the log walls faint at first
but rising in volume

  yip-yip-yip 

  a dog yelped suddenly when the heavy
bear smell was wafted in through the un-
chinked walls one of the braves leaped
to his feet and the huskie was knocked
senseless with a clubs blow

  the scratching continued but from far-
ther along the wall now it was as if the
spirit bear were seeking some weak spot
through which it might force an entrance

  all at once the roughly hewn boards of
the barricaded door gave slightly at the
bottom a fog of white breath billowed
through the jagged cracks puff puff puff

  still the tensed natives waited the wo-
men and children with old rags about their
heads the men holding hands over their
ears without shame

  ayeah ayeahl now we die came
in a whispered chorus from the old squaws
they knew the signal

  in time to shuffling and grunting as the
bear made its way along the wall outside
every eye was turned to the cabins end
wall there one of the logs had been par-
tially chopped out to form the frame of
a rough window or ventilator now the
scratching came from directly underneath
this aperture

  a soundless shiver ran through the hud-
dled natives their bulging eyes saw two
stubby ears being slowly elevated above the
bottom of the log then followed a huge
bears head every hair brought into vision
by the moonlight the little pig eyes swept
the cabins murk the head turned slowly
from side to side one ear twitched and
flattened the great cavern of a mouth
opened wide and then again the beasts
laugh rang out filling the packed dwelling
with its horrid note

  scratching claws sounded on the logs
rough bark again then an aching silence

it was broken by a womans scream
bedlam followed the dogs howled in
unison as the squaws vented shriek after
shriek the men beat themselves on the
chest pounded on the log walls with their
fists they had to react or go mad now
that the nights ordeal was over

  behold i am very brave i tanissi
will see this thing a shout came from one
of the younger men hands clutched at

him in the dark but the boy evaded the
fingers he reached the wall and clambered
up moccasined toes wedged in the log
crevices

  tanissi peered through the aperture
fastening his gaze on the short stretch of
white sand that lay between the cabin and
a high rock ridge to the east

  the spirit bear was in full sight of the
watcher with great head swinging it
ambled in the direction of the ridge sud-
denly the thing stopped and swung about
after several unsuccessful attempts the
brute finally elevated itself upright on the
hind legs forepaws held out straight in
front then it swung from side to side
head swaying back and forth as if per-
forming some bestial dance

  whoo-oo ou-oo-o

  again the brutes unholy laughter filled
the open spaces under the spruce woods
gloom tanissi could stand no more his
fingers suddenly relaxed and he fell in a
sodden heap on the hard-packed earth
floor

  water thrown on the boys face and
rough hands shaking him finally brought
the indian out of his swoon he visioned
the crowding face blurs and suddenly be-
came conscious of pehas croaking voice
droning endlessly

  let it be thus the chief mumbled
because of the spirit bear we cannot
hunt being greatly afraid we have eaten
many dogs and now there are but few
remaining for the pots ayeah it is bad
but one thing can be done word must
be carried to those very strong men the
red coats then they will come in fast
canoes they will kill this spirt bear
and we will live in peace there are brave
men and cunning hunters in the teepees
who goes to carry word to the red
coats

  pehay finished in a silence broken by
soft moccasin shuffling as the men faded
away from the chief go for the red
coats brave the spirit bear and the
terrors of the unknown namoya na-
moyaj

in a moment the old man stood by him-
self in the center of the hut staring
about him in mute bewilderment voices
hissed together as the chief slowly turned
before he had time to speak again three
ghost river



men stepped out of the gloom

  let is be thus one of the braves
clucked in cree behold here is this
tanissi always the boy talks with a big
mouth making a play that he is one of
great courage let him go for the red
coats he is but a youth not having
taken a squaw therefore if the spirit
bear devours him there will be none to
weep this is a strong and good talk i
have spoken

  all at once the hut broke out again into
a babel of sounds the shrill voices of
the squaws were drowned out by a con-
certed boom of assent that came from the
men

  tanissi howled his terror but little no-
tice was taken of it a sacrifice liad been
found a few minutes later the boy was
thrust through the door shivering with
fright the indian came to his feet
clutching a bag of pemmican in one hand
a canoe paddle in the other his bulging
eyes went to the white sand that swept al-
most to the cabin door

  there the spirit bears tracks showed
distinctly huge paw marks tipped with
indentations made by the claws and little
wriggling lines where the long fur on the
beasts feet had dragged along

  the boys eyes went to the serrated line
of cliffs to the east where the bear dis-
appeared each night after his visitation
sudden fear gripped tanissi with a shrill
yelp he bounded down the short beach
threw himself into a little birchbark canoe
and drove the craft out into the gleaming
water with desperate strokes

  from the woods shelter two figures-a
white man and a half-breed-watched the
boys frantic paddle gathering the moon-
beams as the dripping blade flashed and
dipped

  vance the trapper lowered his win-
chester and laughed gone for the noble
red coats eh well let him i have it
in for that guy carnes up here is a good
place to settle it too let him bring the
darned mounties suits me

  he patted his rifles black shape and
the breed joined dutifully in his chuckle

sergeant richard carnes
picked up a stick of firewood from the
pile by the cookstove and fired it with
unerring aim into constable andrew

burkes bunk

  if you had to fchop that stuff you
wouldnt be so damn liberal with it young
fella the smitten man grumbled as he
came upright

  the constable yawned running freckled
hands through his thick hair as he went
on here im improvin my mind trying
to figure out a new way to cook fish sos
you wont know its fish and you-

  listen andy the sergeant halted
him swinging about from the paper lit-
tered table he held up a brown hand for
silence gray eyes on the doorway the
crisscross weather lines on his tanned face
puckered up into little ridges of annoyance

  another dog fight carnes grumbled
as again the distant yelping came to his
ears thats old sokki piling onto the
pups go down and knock the stuffing out
of him i want to finish this cursed re-
port

  some life burke grunted as his moc-
casins thudded to the floor wish id
joined the air service stead of the mounted
police nothin to do up there but turn
a handle an sail around graceful like oh
well i suppose ill be a sergeant some day
myself and then ill pile it onto the un-
fortunate bucks too

  the constable jerked a dog-whip off the
wall and in a moment his thick-set frame
filled the doorway he stepped out into
the norths eye-stabbing sunslune and pad-
ded off toward the yowling that floated
up from the beach below the athabascas
rocks

  the whitewashed walls and red roofs
of the mounted police post stood out
in startling contrast to the blue-black of the
spruce woods sweeping down to the shore
the shimmering lake stretched endlessly
to the blue hills beyond the horizon swal-
lows skimmed along the cliff face and far
out on the lake the inland gulls circled
and shrilled

  but the constable saw none of these
things his gaze was fixed on the yelping
pack that raced up and down the beach
bushy tails flagging wolf jaws snarling de-
fiance at a little birchbark canoe halted in
indecision just out of range

  indian andy said to himself got
a danged good mind to let the dogs chew
you up too bearin tidings of great sor-
row if i know anything quit throwin
	northwest romances

kisses af me you yabbering ape he
growled in reply to a flourished arm

  here youl sokki nistam otak cot
it out now lie down you weinie hounds
burke roared at the leaping dogs

  the long whip thong crackled answer-
ing yelps came from the huskies and in a
few minutes the animals were sitting in a
row atop the cliff pointed ears pricked
venting yapping protests

  the boy paddled to shore got out and
pulled his birchbark up on the beach he
waved a tattered deerskin arm at the con-
stable saying in cree behold i am
tanissi of the people of the river i am
a brave man and very strong i come
bearing a message-

  you got a strong smell anyhow burke
broke in tell your bedtime story to the
chief im only a buck not supposed to
have any brains come on dogs wont
touch you theyre particular as billy-be-
damned

  heres young christopher columbus
with a hot story for the front page
burke roared thrusting the boy into the
cabin

carnes laid a sheaf of papers back
on the table and got to his feet he
towered over the indian boy as tanissis
darting eyes roved from the big mans
moccasins to his yellow-striped riding bree-
ches then to the trig khaki shirt and
the appraising eyes under the close-cropped
brown hair

  whew the sergeant breathed when
the youngsters torrent of speech finally
halted what the devil do you make of
that andy a laughing bear that ram-
bles about scaring the indians out of their
wits

  theyve been making home-brew otrb
of raisins if you ask me the constable
replied ive seen pink kangaroos and
green ostriches doing the black bottom m
my time but these boys sure have a new
brand of parlor tricks better tell him to
go home and tell the tribe to try prune
wine for a change not so much kick to
it

  no theres something behind this fool-
ishness carnes said thin lips set from
what this kid says the tribe is just about
all in from starvation been huddled up
in that cabin for over a month curse

these indians anyhow theyre nothing but
a bunch of children well go up

  burke groaned and walked over to his
bunk collecting his camp clothing he
well knew what was coming and it did

  well get one of the indians at kapows
camp to come down and look after the
dogs carnes told the other man as he
slipped into his revolver belt this will
be about two weeks hike pack the stuff
down to the canoe while i straighten
things up and give this boy something
to eat

  an hour later the three were paddling
north in the police canoe penned up in
the dog pound the huskies rent the air
with their lamentations but the sound
was soon lost and the little craft was
speeding over the glinting water alone but
for the wheeling gulls and piping swal-
lows

three days later the canoe was port-
aged over die height of land it
dropped down the swiftly flowing snow-
bird and shot out onto the smoother waters
of powisitic river

  behold soon we come to the strong
woods mewassii the smell of the deer
country is in my nostrils tanissi clucked
in cree pointing with his paddle

  hope youre right noble redman
burke grunted my backs nearly bust
with driving thi danged canoe all over the
map if there aint no circus when we
arrives look out for-holy cats

  the constable suddenly halted his speech
jerking a thick finger ahead to where the
brown blur of a canoe was shooting along
under the shadows cast by the branching
spruce woods

  carnes had seen the craft too and had
stopped paddling staring from under eye-
shaded hands white men andy he
rumbled at length going the same way
we are and licking right along now id
like to know who those hombres are and
what theyre doing so far north

  tanissi could not understand the words
but the accent he knew the boy plucked
urgently at the sergeants sleeve clucking
that strong man vance and the half-
brother tameau all the time they trap
in the land of little sticks taking many
fox behold they are very-

  you hear that andy the sergeant
ghost river



queried frowning guess the boy knows
what hes talking about vance and that
saskatchewan half-breed two bad actors
trapping in an indian hunting preserve
too sink that paddle now

  burke waited for no more his great
shoulders heaved as the yellow blade bit
the water and in a moment the police canoe
was leaping toward the other craft

  glancing up carnes saw white water
spurting from the trappers paddles he
sensed that they had increased their pace
and had no intention of being questioned

  no sounds now but panting breaths the
creak of knees on the canoes bottom and
the steady whoosji-whoosh-whoosh of the
paddles the police vessel drove through
the water like a thing alive but another
quick glance told carnes they were gain-
ing nothing

all at once the sergeant stopped pad-
dling cupped hands to mouth and
sent a ringing call it came back in boom-
ing reverberations from the cliffs above the
spruce woods was echoed by the winging
gulls

  but the two men in the fleeing canoe
took no notice they were lifting their
craft with long tireless strokes bending
every effort to get away

  stop the canoe-line down and hold
your breath the sergeant ordered his
gray eyes were blazing when he jerked the
long-barreled colts out of its holster and
threw himself flat in the craft

  waiting calmly until his own short
breathing had returned to normal and the
canoe was motionless carnes held the wea-
pon on the canoes rim sighted carefully
and fired

  cr-ack a little spurt of white water
leaped up ahead of the other vessel

  rotten shot burke grunted i could
hit that canoe with a beer bottle from here
theyll be aroimd that point in a minute
go on dick let em have-

  cr-ack in time to the revolvers report
a cry of surprise welled out across the
water the man in the bow of the trappers
vessel was staring stupidly at his pad-
dle the bullet had severed the slender
shaft

  cripes  what a fluke andy laughed
but it did the work    hot dog here
we go the constable called when he heard

carnes blade slash into the water again

  the trappers made no move to get away
now they sat motionless in the little ves-
sel while the two mounties paddled lei-
surely across the lake

  whats the idea carnes threw out
when the two canocs were bobbing side by
side he addressed vance beetle-browed
and sullen sitting crouched forward with
a dirty mackinaw shirt slouching back over
his great shoulders

  ill show you what the idea is the
other man threatened thrusting out his
stubbled face eyes gleaming i aint done
nothin an you cant arrest me for travel-
in around on a pleasure trip can you
correct the sergeant admitted cheer-
fully but his voice was cold i cant
but what i will do is arrest you for trap-
ping within the confines of the athabasca
indian hunting preserve

  hear tliat vance turned to the half-
breed waving a thick arm in disgust says
were trappin in the reserve but he dont
see no traps does he humorous guy eh
tameau

  go ahead vance challenged swing-
ing back again you see two guys doin
the tourist act on powistic an you arrests
them for trappin go ahead ole-timer
youll have a fine record at headquarters
by the time im finished with you

  go through them andy the sergeant
ordered ignoring vances tone he was
watching the big mans hand crawl down
to the black muzzle of the winchester ly-
ing against the canoe strut when burke
reached over

  dont a single word that leaped out
in time to the colts vance slumped back
again a half grin on his thick lips two
rifles clattered aboard the police canoe and
burke sat up again daintily dusting his
hands

  all right the sergeant said to the
trapper ill allow you to make camp here
for the night but youll turn back for fond
du lac in the morning get that

  say youre generous vance sneered
when im done with you youll wish
youd left an innocent guy alone go on
tameau get away from these crazy ginks
before i goes sick at me stomach

  the half-breed dipped his paddle in re-
ply to the order

  once out of earshot vance laughed
	northwest romances

again rumbling at the other man thats
puttin it over eh  thought them guns we
pinched from pehays lodges was ours
didnt know we was out there layin for
them to grab us too late for them to do
anythin tonight tameau well pull our
stuff an lay low till they beats it a
week of hangin around here will sicken
them bozos go on paddle

  burke watched the moving canoe with
rebellious eyes querying why the blazes
didnt you arrest them and have done
with it

  because i have no direct evidence so
far nothing but a hunch those two
slinks have some hand in this spirit bear
foolery and ive got to catch them and
their animal red-handed   

  how far to the teepees of your people
oh tanissi he asked the boy in cree

  the youth pointed a leathery finger to
the trees rimming a long point carnes
nodded glancing at the dimming sun and
measuring the distance to be traveled

mhphats a good kid for an indian
x the sergeant informed the other
man pointing to where the red spot of a
distant camp fire flickered against the black
background of the spruce woods if we
get out of this okay ill see that he has
some decent clothes and a trapping outfit
in his mind the mountie estimated the
distance between the fire and pehays
cabin as he said vance will be watching
that fire and when he sees fresh wood
being put on it hell know were there-
only were not lets go

 you take too much for granted
dickie burke grumbled he aint so
thick in the head as all that bet a months
pay he watched us land here told you i
saw something moving back in the brush
behind us well where are you heading
for anyhow

  over to that ridge crest carnes told
him ignoring the advice tanissi says
thats where the spirit bear comes from
every night go easy with the canoe now
not a sound mind

  the sergeant waited patiently until he
noted a drift of clouds sailing toward the
half moon the first rolling puffs were
obscuring the yellow crescent when carnes
pushed the birchbark off and drove the
little vessel toward the ridge

  the two mounties reached the willows
fringing the shore cautiously pulled the
canoe up in the shelter of the bushes and
set off they kept their heads well down
to avoid the stinging withes zig-zagging
about the clumps they passed through
bushes of dwarfed poplars and jack-pines
twisted by the ever-present winds and
reached the base of the rock-ridge on
silent moccasins they leaped from one
boulder to another crouched down halt-
ing every now and then to listen

  by cripes this jazz bear is givin me
the willies-

  carnes whirled about white-faced under
the moons faint rays he darted back
throwing burke across a smooth rock one
hand pressed hard on the constables lips

almost at the same moment from
directly overhead the spirit bears
mocking whoo- ou-oo stabbed the
nights quiet

  carnes got to hi hands and knees again
immediately he beckoned the constable
to follow and crept forward to throw
himself flat all at once

  burke obeyed the urging hand joined
the sergeant and glanced through a cleft
in the rocks about twenty feet below him
a hard-packed trail twisted about through
the boulders

  the sergeants steel-muscled fingers bit
into burkes arm when a moment later his
eyes visualized a huge moving bulk trotting
down the trail the soft padding of furred
paws came distinctly on the thin air

  the two men gazed at each other wide-
eyed when the thing passed from view in
the difection of the indian camp the si-
lence was broken by burke exclaiming
low-toned by my sweet aunt polly but
its a bear all right well now wouldnt
that give you a pain in the neck 

  the sergeant nodded agreement know
what i think andy he querried pretty
sure this is one of vances tricks youll
remember that scare he threw into the
dogribs over on the great slave im
satisfied hes trapping on the reserve and
whats more that hes trying to scare these
chippewayans away so as to have a clear
field for himself thats a bear right
enough guess he caught it as a cub and
trained the brute easy to do that youve
seen performing bears in a circus often
ghost river



enough

  by golly youre the hunchiest guy i
ever gambled around with burke ad-
mitted what are you goin to do-

  his words were cut off by the bears
yowling roar from the river again and
again it sounded a faint chorus of
screams answered then the huskies howl-
ing notifying the waiting men that the
nights terror was over for the indians

  hope mr vance is still watching us
feeding that fire the constable chuckled
reckon ill have to take on the job of
bear trainer now as well as policeman
cook engineer canoeman and a few other
odd jobs not a dull moment in this
mounted police show is there

  carnes hard hand signaled for silence
the laughing bear was returning the
sergeants heart sounded loud as a drum
beat but above its thudding came the pad-
ding of the great feet below

  he saw the brown shadow pass up the
gully stand for a moment silhouetted
against the clear sky then disappear

  now andy carnes whispered to the
other man as he slithered silently to the
trail below to stand there gazing at the
huge pad marks

  get your gun out came the low order
bent double the two men reached the ridge
crest and crept forward

  whew a whistling breath of sur-
prise from the sergeant they stopped
momentarily staring at the trail where it
disappeared into what was apparently the
mouth of a cave

  both men threw themselves down lying
with distended nostrils endeavoring to ob-
tain some sound or scent from within
nothing came carnes motioned with his
hand and commenced working forward ex-
tended full length on the rocks

  presently the sergeant picked up a faint
glimmer of moonight penetrating through
some of the caverns crevices carnes
forced himself to remain motionless until
his eyes became accustomed to the gloom
reaching back he kicked burke softly with
his moccasin

  with a bound the sergeant came to his
feet racing across the caves uneven floor
toward an upright blur

  down down canres yelled to the
other man throwing himself flat

  in that moment two shots rang out fill-
ing the cavern with thunderous booming
and the acrid odor of burned powder

carnes was up again leaping for-
ward  one outthrust hand tipped with
glinting light above the racing man the
bears great bulk towered as the thing
fumbled with its forepaws and now the
cave was filled with the thudding of mocca-
sined feet and short stabbing breaths

  cr-ack another stab of yellow light
when carnes fired again

  the laughing bear swayed uncertainly
for a moment then suddenly crashed for-
ward in a coughing heap an automatic
revolver clattered to the cave floor from
one fore paw

  there was a seconds eerie silence as the
two men looked at each other then back to
the long-haired thing stiffening in death at
their feet

  burke stepped forward poking at the
bear with his colts all at once an ex-
plosive oath broke from him he dropped
the revolver snatched out his hunting knife
and commenced hacking at the hide

  half a dozen quick slashes at the thongs
lacing the skin and he threw the bears
head back to reveal vances heavy face
now white and still

  carnes nodded sheathing his revolver
came out pretty well as i thought
andy he said soberly ive seen the same
game played on the arctic coast with the
eskimos vance was scaring the indians
away so that hed have this white fox
country for himself huh-huh he paid the
price

  sure did burkes cheerful voice filled
the cave with rumbling echoes clever
guy wasted up here see all that junk he
had for rigging himself out some back-
stage this is all right

  carnes eyes roved to the clothing and
camp gear scattered about the cave walls
yeah he grunted strip that skin off
andy well take it back to the chippe-
wayans otherwise theyll never believe but
that this was a spirit bear im going to
send some of the hunters to bring tameau
in well meet at the indian camp

  burkes whistling followed the sergeant
as he crawled out into the norths crisp
clean air
fossilbunk

by g w tweeddale

professor of paleozoology waa the lordly monicker the stranger dangled
before the awe-struck klondike sourdoughs and the power of the name
was playing havoe along rich bonanza creek

andy burke laid the last rock
atop the monument he was erect-
ing and turned triumphantly to his
partner bill he said this camp is go-
ing to be another klondike and sitting
as we are astride of the three best claims
on bonanza creek were in the money
why i bet we clean up a whole million
and i aint in favor of taking any less
bill simons carefully folded his loca-
tion notice placed it in a tobacco can
and tucked it into a niche between the
rocks andy he chuckled when the
lord made little men he gave them a heap
of optimism-kind of apologizing i guess
for their size - and i agree my small
friend with his judgment he really owed
them something for shortchanging them

the way he-

  andy burke rose to his full five foot
one inch height and glared disparagingly
at his partner as he shouted i agree that
little men have plenty of optimism and
there aint no wonder all they have to
do when they get to feeling low is to
look around at some of them there big
hulks that just missed being beef cattle
account of having been cheated out of
two extra legs

  and when you go to studying the situa-
tion its plain to see why the lord went
to all the trouble of making them there
big unwieldly lummoxes and in case you
aint figured it out its this away hav-
ing used all his choice clay in making
a perfect man according to his model he
finds he has left over a heap of waste
clay that aint fit to use and he throws it all
together in a pile and sir when that mas
starts to walk away he aint got the heart
to stop it only hows hell fasten on two
extra legs on the next one and call it an
ox

  bill simons lowered his bulk onto a flat

boulder ana smiled at his partner as
you have now delivered your little speech
he said you can let yourself down and
relax standing on tiptoe does not as i
have so often reminded you add anything
to your height just makes you look to a
full-grown man like a bantam rooster get-
ting ready to crow

  and your self-applauding theory about
the reason for a little mans optimism re-
minds me of a very old saying small
things please small minds which explains
your evident satisfaction with yourself

  then that wild prediction for this
chisana camp look my small fry at
those saw-toothed porphyry mountains to
our west while even here on bonanza
creek is slate and shale no schist in sight
and you yell klondike and spout about
a million dollar stake i am again re-
minded of that old saying just quoted

  as a discreet cough interrupted bill
the partners turned to face a tall bewhis-
kered man bill simons quick eye gauged
the stranger at a glance first from the
twinkle in the deep-set eyes he knew that
the man had been listening to their dis-
cussion second the hands clasping the fur
cap were long and slender and well-cared
for certainly not the hands of a miner

  my name is goudlemeyer their visi-
tor announced professor of paleozoology
these mountains to the north and west
look most interesting early cambrian i
would say who knows what fabulous
treasures may be locked in the bowels of
yonder range what long sought-for fos-
sils what fortunes in gold perhaps the
mother lode think of it gentlemen the
great mother lode which has been search-
ed for by countless generations of men
since the beginning of time may be con-
cealed in yonder mountains the pro-
fessor concluded his remarks with a beatn-


ing smile directed at both his listeners

  but it was andy burke who stepped
forward and extended his hand andy rec-
ognized in the professor a champion to his
cause professor he said my name is
andrew percival burke and im sure glad
to meet up with a man of real intelligence
he looked condescendingly at his partner
you know a man can get just as hungry
for intellectual companionship as he does
for victuals and im telling you profes-
sor im just about starved in this respect

i can appreciate all you have said about
this camp making history knowing some-
thing of geology like i do

  bill simons saw the professors beard
tremble just a little as andy ceased speak-
ing but bill could not tell whether the
professor was concealing his mirth or
smothering a yawn

  mr burke said the professor
while my examination of the area has
as yet been superficial i feel that it has
been sufficient to justify the positive pre-


	northwest romances

diction that this camp will go down in
history as one of the worlds greatest
placers later after i have made an ex-
haustive examination of the terrain i
will know more in fact it is quite pos-
sible that i may gain geological data that
will reveal the whereabouts of the pre-
glacial channels responsible for these placer
deposits in which event i will pass along
the information to you miners again the
professor was beaming now in our short
acquaintance i have grown to like you
gentlemen and have in just the last few
moments decided that you shall be the
first the very first to profit financially
from any information i may obtain as
for me gold has no attraction my only
interest is in paleozoology and now my
dear friends i must be returning to my
studies and shall bid you a very good
day he bowed profusely and turned
away

as the tall form of the profes-
sor disappeared over a ridge bill
simons glanced down at his partner andy
was again standing on tip-toe rolling a
cigarette with his left hand and pointing
dramatically in the direction the professor
had taken with his right

  there goes real learning andy de-
clared admiringly and i just hope part-
ner that you come to realize that from
me and the professor you can learn all
there is to know about geology and the
like and all free of charge

  bill picked up a rock and with an
underthrow tossed it at a whistler perched
on a piece of projecting rim rock calling
to mind a little story about a spider and
a fly he said i seem to see a certain
half-pint of my acquaintance in the role
of the fly and in the bewhiskered stranger
i see the spider and now while your
bulging intellect wrestlers with this be-
wildering comparison i am heading for
the recorders office happy in the thought
that i have free access to such a vast
reservoir of knowledge

  bill simons was worried as he left the
tent he hoped that andy had been clown-
ing and had not accepted the professor
at par but he never could be sure about
andy bill himself was convinced that
the man was either a crank or belonged
to the slicker type

  he reached the tent-office of the dis-
trict recorder and filed his notices of
location then headed for the roadhouse
to pick up a few items of food their camp
was short of as he entered the big tent
and elbowed his way through the crowd
to the grocery department a small man in
miners boots and mackinaw sauntered
casually away from a group of men and
stopped by bill and extended his hand

  was just figuring to look you up he
said i have some news bill nodded in
quick understanding and the man contin-
ued on through the crowd

  bill hastily selected his purchases then
hurried out the side entrance shorty best
must have some worthwhile news he felt
or he would have waited till evening when
he and his partner would be as was their
habit dropping into bills tent for a game
of poker he found shorty seated on an
empty packing case

  shorty took one quick look over his
shoulder then whispered excitedly bill
word has just come in that a new strike
has been made back of the porphyry
range on wilson creek and being in a
slate and schist country it sounds good to
me

  bill simons rested his pack on the tent
rail and lighted his pipe how far he
inquired

  as the crow flies ten miles answered
shorty by pack trail thirty-five if we
leave pronto we can by traveling light hit
the head of wilson creek by noon to-
morrow my horse is already caught up
so you and andy can use my camp out-
fit no time to go to the beaver after
your stock ive plenty of grub packed too
now if youre going to take in this strike
go get andy and well hit the trail

  bill adjusted his pack then extended
his hand thanks shorty andy and i
will be waiting for you at the eldorado
trail-crossing so long

  bill made the mile to camp in record
time he found andy seated on his bunk
with a much-used geological bulletin spread
on his knees bill smiled broadly as he
noted the deep frown on the little mans
forehead

  brushing up on picture geology i see
he teased oh yes there is a map a sim-
plified one i believe

  andy carefully folded the map closed
fossilbvisk	

the book and rose to his feet some-
bodys been talking he stated haughtily
and im glad to know that youre capable
of learning didnt stop in at the profes-
sors on your way back did you

  considering the source i choose to
ignore both of the implications contained
in your remark bill answered and ill
talk about more important business we
are leaving in just ten minutes for a new
strike on wilson creek and i suggest
that you get your puny frame in motion
and roll your pack

  bill simons and andy reached the el-
dorado crossing just as shorty broke over
the bank with a wave of the hand shorty
started for the divide and the partners
fell in behind the pace never hurried
never slowed but maintained an even gait
that ate up the miles

  dusk was falling as the three men
reached the summit of the pass shorty
made for some scrub spruce a mfle down
the slope the snow which covered the
summit to a depth of two feet thinned
perceptible as they descended only a skim
of white remained at the grove but an icy
wind was blowing off the glacier bluffs to
the north of the pass

  andy and shorty pitched camp and bill
took an ax and attacked a dead spruce
tree slashing some of the smaller boughs
soon the men were sipping hot tea and
munching hardtack before the relaxing
comfort and warmth of a bright crackling
fire

  suddenly andy pointed to the back-
trail stampede he shouted and it
looks as if all the chisana camp has turn-
ed out

  bill looked towards the pass just as the
moon emerged from behind a cloud bank
and there against the sky line he could
see many moving objects shorty best
took one look then raced for his horse

  well have to hit the trail and now
he called over his shoulder

  in just a few minutes they were again
on the move there was no trail but an
almost full-moon made the descent not
too hazardous shorty urged the little pack
horse into a shuffling trot while andy
speeded up and took the lead many times
in the next few hours bill marveled at
his small partners ingenuity once when
they were on the edge of a seemingly

precipitous diff andy with almost uncan-
ny accuracy led them to a passable descent
dawn was breaking as they reached the
wilson creek beach and clambered down
to the creek level

  a puzzled look spread over bill simonss
face as he looked at the sheer walls of
the granite cliffs across wilson creek he
nudged shorty and pointed shorty best
took one look and leaped high into the air
then threw his hat to the ground and
stamped it

  this here calls for killing he shouted
wrathfully and when i get my hands
on that there white-livered tadpole sam
williams ill make buzzard feed why
that wolverene told me this here was
a schist country and gravel pans went up
to an ounce and what do we find  noth-
ing but granite bluffs bet there aint a
flashet of gold this here side of the
divide

a hearty burst of laughter
caused bill to turn angrily in the
direction of andy who was mounted on
a large boulder holding aloft a long sliver
of granite rock

  this here explained andy is a
crystalline rock commonly known as gran-
ite and im just announcing that yester-
day i opened a school on geology yes
sir and you fellows were my two first
pupils you see andy paused to snicker
figuring as i always do that experi-
ence is the best teacher i dont say a
word when bill breaks the news about
this here wilson creek strike and how its
a schist country when i know that the
geological survey shows a granite con-
tact less than a mile west of wilson pass

  bill simons dived for his partner but
andy was much too fast for him why
you midget-brained little weasel shouted
bill ill pull you apart and poison the
buzzards with the remnants of your car-
cass ill-

  a choking sound from shorty made
both men turn short was sitting on the
wet gravel his face convulsed as bill
started toward him shorty let lose with a
roar of laughter bill he sputtered be-
tween spasms that there partner of
yours is holding four aces and you and i
have it coming we both knew bettern to
swallow this here wilson creek strike


northwest romances

just didnt use what the lord gave us for
brains

  brains said andy who had again
closed in to within speaking distance is
described by noah webster as a soft
whitish convoluted mass and he says con-
voluted can mean twisted not that im
making any personal insinuations

  intelligence my small prune only
comes from cultivation of the soft greyish
matter you just referred to bill gave a
snort of derision and might i remark
when that same soft greyish matter be-
comes addled as in the case of a certain
little termite of my acquaintance the rea-
soning powers which normally act as a
balance are gone

  i do enjoy hearing you two fellows
spout interposed shorty but im look-
ing to the head of this here bar where
a good half of the chisana camp is gath-
ered with more outfits coming in by the
minute im anxious to close m and see
if that there sam williams is in the bunch
grave digging will be easy on this here
bar

  at that moment the aforementioned
sam williams walked away from the
crowd at the upper end of the bar shorty
bests hand dropped to his gun and he
stepped clear of his two companions

  make for your iron you damn pole-
cat  he commanded one of us is fer-
tilizing this here bar

  sam made no move for his gun but
continued to walk steadily forward and
only stopped when he stood in front of
the irate shorty wjhat in sam hill is
eating you he asked you knowd i
aint been across this here civide before
for answer shorty bests hand shot out
and sam reeled back from the force of
the open-handed slap go for you gun
you sidewinder yelled shorty or aint
you got the guts

  the face of sam williams grew livid
and his hand flashed to the  at his belt
the next instant the almost deafening roar
of the two guns fired almost at the same
time shattered the stillness then both
shorty and sam were sprawled full length
on the gravel bar but not from the effect
of bullets

  andy burke and bill simons had leaped
a scant second before the trigger fingers
had tightened andy was now sitting

astride sam williams while bill hrfd
shorty easily one big hand bearing down
into his middle

  when you two firebrands decide to
talk this matter over in a sane manner you
will be allowed to get up bill grinned
as he laid down the law until that time
you will remain exactly as you are i dont
know just what is behind all this but im
willing to bet a hundred to one that this
fake stampede was not started by a sour-
dough

  you is correct in that growled sam
williams and if anybody butts in when
im bumping off that there professor ill
slit his gizzard wide open even if hes my
best friend now bill if you will just
call this here little bulldogs off me i agrees
to wait till after ive bumped off that
fossil-hunting varmint before i musses up
that there polecat you is holding in your
protecting embrace

  nobody is protecting me bellowed
shorty but from where i am it looks
as if you were going to have to get leave
from that half-pint of dynamite thats
straddling your frame before you can even
stand on your two legs and if you know
when youre lucky williams youll keep
a bodyguard handy after andy lets you
go

any further remarks from
shorty were muffled out as bill
deftly flipped him on his face and bore
down hard andy following his partners
lead pressed a hand firmly over the mouth
of sam williams

  here you both lie raving like a pair
of mad malemutes while that fake pro-
fessor hightails it out of the country why
i bet right now hes well out on the mc-
carthy trail

  bill was interrupted by a smothered
sound from sam andy removed the pres-
sure on the hand covering his prisoners
mouth

  is willing to call it square with shorty
if he apologizes for the way he called me
sam promised

  bill raised shortys head just enough
to permit him to speak you can lift your
damn carcass off me shorty mumbled
pears like i flew off to sam and i
pologize

  a moment later the two men were on
fossilbunk



their feet hands clasped you dumed old
fire-eater said sam aint you knowm
me long enough to know i aint staging
no fake stampede

  just mad at myself i guess shorty
answered sheepishly although back at
camp you wouldnt tell me where you
heard about this here strike and some-
how when i saw these here granite bluffs
i got the fool notion you done tricked me
if you lovers is through holding hands
i make a move that we hit the trail
andy burke suggested i take it you
are both anxious to see the professor and
i just remembered i ran away and left
some unfinished business myself

  as shorty best reached for the halter
rope of his pony a group of men joined
them from the upstream camp where sev-
eral campfires indicated that at least some
of the stampeders were not too angry to
think of breakfast bill simons recognized
the man in the lead it was dan sullivan
an operator from fairbanks dan was
laughing

  have any of you fellows seen a tall
be whiskered stranger he inquired it
seems that some of the boys have business
with him this stranger i am told is or
was accepting small contributions in gold
for the furtherance of scientific research in
alaska and in return he was giving out
red hot tips on rich placer deposits

  you can just tell them fellows that
this here professor is my meat sam
shouted and for them to lay off i gave
this here polecat twenty-five ounces for the
tip i got on this here wilson creek i dont
give a damn for that tfiere gold but i is
bound on principle to make this here faker
into buzzard feed

  you have considerable competition
dan sullivan told sam at least half a
dozen of the men who arrived about the
time i came in have designs on the scalp
of goudlemeyer and as at least two of
them have already hit the back-trail i
would say that you sam have at best
a fourth mortgage on the scalp-lock of the
gentleman in question

  sam leaped for the bank and started
across the bench in a long easy dogtrot

  i hope that sam does not attempt to
keep that pace all the way over the sum-
mit bill simons said

  if he doesnt slow down before he hits

high ground were going to have to throw
the pack on my bob horse and load the
durned fool on prophesied shorty and
seeing we have no business cm this here
wilson creek i move we grab a snack
and then hit the trail

  i agree about our having no further
business on this side of the divide but it
is my opinion that each one of us who
was tricked into this mad rush to wilson
creek owes it to himself as well as to
the citizenry of alaska to make an ex-
ample of this cheap grafter so lets follow
shortys suggestion

  i heartily concur with your idea bill
dan sullivan said i myself will be con-
tent to start now and munch some hard-
tack on the trail

  all set shouted shorty as he again
reached for the halter on his pony and
started up the bench

  dan sullivan was close at shortys heels
and bill started to fall in back of dan
when he stopped and looked around
where in hell is andy he asked

  you mean that partner of yours
aked dan sullivan in surprise why i
thought you knew andy legged it out
right after he made his little speech i
only heard the end where he stated he
had unfinished business in chisana

  ill bet a plugged nickle that the little
runt is planning to put something over on
us im telling you fellows that half-pint
ispends half of his time figuring ways to get
my goat

  in spite of it all bill you have stuck
with andy for the past eight years so i
take it you like him as he is i have
known andy for twenty year and i can
say that your judgment is good andy
burke is a very loyal partner dan sul-
livan turned and looked down at bill
that is be amended wih a chuckle he
is when you are not in hearing distance
bill simons made no comment he was
watching the bulky figure of sam wil-
liams outlined on a hogback about half a
mile ahead sam was climbing in long
strides but a big smile came when bill
caught sight of a tiny moving speck far
up the mountain and well to the left he
reached for hie field glass and adjusted
it to the range

  that runt andy he remarked to no
one in particular is really making time

but why in hell is he so far south hes
heading directly into the saw-tooth
range

  dan borrowed bills glass and studied
andys position for some moments your
partner is i would say using what the
lord gave him for brains he will have
tough going but if he can make it through
the saw-teeth he will hit the headwaters
on bonanza creek and cut the distance to
chisana in three in other words bill even
with tough going andy should barring
mishap be in camp before we reach the
summit

  in silence the men continued to climb
finally bill spoke in a thoughtful manner
almost as if he were thinking out loud i
cant figure just why andy is in such a
rush to reach camp it is not all just
the responsibility of citizenship in so far
as the professor is concerned although
the little cuss is a stickler for square deal-
ing

it was approaching midnight when the
three men reached the eldorado cross-
ing bill quickly bade his companions good-
night and headed for his tent he was dead
tired every aching muscle in his body
rebelled against any further movement
but he gritted his teeth and climbed to his
tent he fully expected to see a lighted
candle in the tent and to hear andys
cheerful wisecracking but all was dark

  he groped for a candle and lighted it
then staggered toward his bunk he would
stretch out for a short breather before pre-
paring supper for an hour he lay relaxed
and motionless then as his eyes became
heavy he scrambled to his feet sleep
would at the moment be far more wel-
come than food but he had work to do
he must find andy then assist in the hunt
for goudlemeyer

  bill picked up kindling and started the
fire then put on water for tea he felt
much refreshed from his short rest some
hot food and he would be ready for the
trail again

  just then an agonizing human wail
sounding from the direction of the bonan-
za creek trail brought bill around to face
the tent entrance he reached for his gun
belt which he had left on the bunk and
leaped through the door and down the

trail the trail was easily discernible and
a pinkish glow on the eastern horizon
heralded the rising sun

  bill reached the bench overlooking the
tent town of chisana and started down
then as his eyes focused on the trail
ahead he skidded to a halt and stared in
momentary disbelief a horseman was
advancing up the trail traveling at a fast
walk just ahead of the horse stumbled the
tall lanky professor goudlemeyer the
horseman was andy burke mounted on
his own pony

  he was leaning over the horses neck
and prodding the professor with a slim
pole held in his left hand a heavy 
rested menacingly in his right andy was
talking in a loud voice apparently trying
to drown out the low moaning of his pris-
oner

  im he was saying willing to donate
that twenty ounces you snitched from me
but as i done told you back at the
beaver im relieving you of all that dust
you stole from those other miners also
as ive before stated youre taking a forced
march across the wilson creek divide on
short rations

  catching sight of bill andy called hi
there partner you going some place
better turn back or youll miss a good
show he reined in his pony and beamed
down on bill simons

  the limbs of the professor crumpled
from sheer weariness and his bloodshot
eyes fastened pleadingly on bill please
mr simons he wined call this fireball
off me im dying from exhaustion i re-
peat i am about to expire if you refuse
to intervene you will be found guilty of
brutal murder bill simons ignored the
professor

  how did you succed in overtaking
this sidewinder he inquired of andy
he must have had a good head start

  it was not often tliat andy had such
an advantage in height when talking with
bill he threw a leg over his saddle pom-
mel and gazed down on his partner

  knowing that if justice was to pre-
vail in the case of this here professor
moren talking had to be done i figured a
short cut across the saw teeth but when
i was crossing glacier park i decided that
there was no use in bearing north to get
to chisana when this here hyena would

     in the great northwest the lynx is the
   deadly foe of the fox which has little
   chance of escape when the snow is soft
   reynard makes good time during the frst
   five or six miles of his flight although he
   sinks deeply at each bound meanwhile
   the lynx just slogs along at the same steady
   trot and finally catches up to his victim

     the lynx has one weakness-that of fol-
   lowing the trail of a trapper just out of
   curiosity if the trapper suspects that he
   is being followed he just lies in ambush
   and comes back to the cabin zoith a good
   pelt a beaver too has been known to kill
   a lynx one day in the early spring an in-
   dian saw a lynx crouclting on a log watch-
   ing the beaver hole in the ice at length
   a beaver came up cautiously and crawled
   out of the water the lynx sprang but the
   beaver dived back into the hole with the
   lynx hanging onto him

     the indian ivaited he might get one
   skin out of this fight-maybe two but
   neither the beaver nor the lynx came to the
   surface he cut himself a forked pole and
   fished about on the bottom of the pond
   finally he found the bedraggled body of
   the lynx the beaver had drowned him

be hightailing it for the white river so
naturally i headed south and reached tha
beaver last night just when this polecat
was climbing aboard my horse which he
had caught up

  andy slapped a black leather satchel
strapped to his saddle pack this here
bag lias all the swag the professor col-
lected in chisana and while i havent
weighed it up i estimate its weight at
around two hundred ounces

   bill was not awed by his partners height
or achievement in capturing the professor
singlehanded one question my little
man he said sarcastically just when
did the professor get you for that twenty
ounces we only met him yesterday a
scant two hours before hitting the wilson
creek trail and at that time he promised
us a tip sometime in the future

  andy scowled down at the professor
thats right bill he answered soberly
it was just ten minutes after you high-
tailed it for the recorders office that he
comes puffing up the hill and tells me he
is passing out that tip said he knew all

the time he was talking with us that wil-
son creek had real pay but wanted to sat-
isfy himself we were okay then when the
damned polecat was leaving he told me how
his research work was dependent on con-
tributions and i like a sucker dishes out
my twenty ounces thats why i was look-
ing over those maps when you showed up
it was right then as i told you and shorty
on wilson creek i started my school on
geology

  sam williams with a loud shout came
racing up the trail brandishing his gun
is obliged andy for delivering this
here prisoner he panted me and the
gang just came in we was headed for the
skola to cut off his retreat when shorty
spotted you in the beaver flat now all
the citizens of this here camp is assembled
awaiting this spotted cat

  which means said andy with a great
sigh that im cheated out of a little
trip to wilson creek poking the profes-
sor with his long pole the little man
snappped climb onto your dogs whis-
kers im releasing you to tire tender mer-

the ballad of gum-boot ben

 by robert service

       he was an old prospector with a vision bleared and dim

      he asked me jor a grubstake and the same i gave to him

      he hinted of a hidden trove and when i made so bold
      to question his veracity this is the tale he told

i do not seek the copper streak nor yet the yellow dust

i am not fain for sake of gain to irk the frozen crust

let fellows gross find gilded dross far other is my mark

oh gentle youth this is the truth-i go to seek the ark

i prospected the pelly bed i prospected the white

the nordenscold for love of gold i piked from morn till night

afar and near for many a year i led the wild stampede

until i guessed that all my quest was vanity and greed

then came i to a land i knew no man had ever seen

a haggard land forlornly spanned by mountains lank and lean

the nitchies said twas full of dread of smoke and fiery breath

and no man dare put foot in there for fear of pain and death

but i was made all unafraid so careless and alone

day after day i made my way into that land unknown

night after night by camp-fire light i crouched in lonely thought
oh gentle youth this is the truth-i knew not what i sought

i rose at dawn i wandered on tis somewhat fine and grand
to be alone and hold your own-in gods vast awesome land

come woe or weal tis fine to feel a hundred miles between

the trails you dare and pathways where the feet of men have been

and so it fell on me a spell of wander-lust was cast

the land was still and strange and chill and cavernous and vast

and sad and dead and dull as lead the valleys sought the snows

and far and wide on every side the ashen peaks arose

the moon was like a silent spike that pierced the sky right through
the small stars popped and winked and hopped in vastitudes of blue

and unto me for company came creatures of the shade

and formed in rings and whispered things that made me half afraid

and strange though be twas borne on me that land had lived of old

and men had crept and slain and slept where now they toiled for gold
through jungles dim the mammoth grim had sought the oozy fen

and on his track all bent of back had crawled the hairy men

and furthermore strange deeds of yore in this dead place were done
they haunted me as wild and free i roamed from sun to sun

until i came where sudden flame uplit a terraced height

a regnant peak that seemed to seek the coronal of night


 i scaled the peak my heart was weak yet on and on i pressed
 skyward i strained until i gained its dazzling silver crest

 and there i found with all around a world upine and stark

 swept clean of snow a flat plateau and on it lay-the ark

 yes there i knew by two and two the beasts did disembark
 and so in haste i ran and traced in letters on the ark
 my human name-ben smiths the same and now i want to float
 a syndicate to haul and freight to town that noble boat

      i met him later in a bar and made a gay remark
      anent an ancient miner and an option on the ark

      he gazed at me reproachfully as only topers can

      but what he said i cant repeat-he was a bad old man

the ragtime kid

      the kid that handled the music box the night dangerous dan mcgrew was shot in the
   malemute saloon died quietly in seattle according to the united press

       hartley claude myrick sixty-five was the ragtime kid of robert services poem of the
   yukon he was a sourdough in the northland at the age of thirteen atid played the first piano
   brought into skagway alaska

       in  he was playing a piano in white horse yukon territory the night service got the
   inspiration for the shooting of dan mcgrew the poet once claimed that the names in his
   ballad were fictitious but the poem was based on actual happenings

      myrick became known from nome to chilkoot pass as the ragtime kid he followed
   the gold rushes of the north and later the glitter of the stage pounding on his music box
   but he didnt make a strike until he set up business in seattle

       he was wiped out in the  stock market crash but re-established himself in business
   and lived comfortably until his death last july

murder
without
penalty

there may be plenty of perfect
crimes committed but because of
their perfection the police never
even hear of them it is the almost perfect
crimes that make the trouble for both the
perpetrators and the police one case i
worked on came so close to being perfect
it caused me to make an error that almost
ruined my career in the royal canadian
mounted police and occasioned a serious
miscarriage of justice

  but-and this is the strange aspect of
the case- the man who committed the
crime could be killed tomorrow by a cer-
tain other man and the law could not
touoh the murderer

  in the first place i am forced to admit
that i blundered badly the upshot was
that one man was sentenced to be hanged
another to a term of imprisonment

  at the time of this happening i was in
charge of the peel river post one spring
day-march th-two young men called
they gave their names as harold kearson
and charles ripley they were drifting
north on a prospecting trip i checked
over their supplies carefully saw that
they were well-equipped and sent them on
their way at the time i didnt dream that
within a few months i would be called on
to arrest one of them on a charge of mur-
der and robbery

  in september just before freeze-up
charles ripley again called at my post
he was played out from paddling up-
stream for two days but he managed to
narrate a wild and lengthy story

  ripley said that he and kearson had



by william brockie

ex-constable royal

canadian mounted police

a weird narrative of fiendish northland
murder that stumped the best brains of
the mounties

drifted slowly along when one day they
came across an isolated cabin its occu-
pant an elderly prospector was dying
of scurvy there was a lot of scurvy in
the north that year because vegetable crops
had been frozen

  they did what they could for the sick
man whose name they learned was curtis
martin but he died just the same be-
fore he died martin made a rough will
leaving all he had to ripley and kearson
making but one condition they were to
turn half of the gold already on hand
and what they worked from his claim over
to the authorities this half was to go to
martins son provided the authorities
could locate him ripley and kearson will-
ingly agreed to the terms because there
was quite a lot of raw gold in the shack
and the claim was a real strike but that
same clause in the will was the cause of
an almost perfect crime being perpetrated

  the partners worked the claim all sum-
mer until it petered out they checked over
the gold on hand and it rated about twen-
ty thousand dollars mighty good returns
for one seasons work

  then according to ripleys story came
friction his partner kearson was against
turning over half the gold to die authori-
ties he wanted to slide out of the country
quietly and not report at any of our posts

  ripley said that he was dead against
the suggestion he wanted to keep the
promise made to martin the partners
argued the matter so violently they al-
most came to blows

seeing that matters had come to a show-
northwest

down ripley took the will and their only
rifle and told kearson that he was head-
ing for the nearest police post to explain
everything they could then leave the
country with their stake and all would
be in order

  kearson produced a pistol ordered rip-
ley to drop the rifle and will and head
inland he also told ripley that when he
returned he would find the shack burned
down and he kearson with most of the
gold missing he added that he would
leave part of the gold in the cache so that
when ripley returned with the police they
would find the small amount of gold and
not belive ripleys story that kearson had
threatened him and with devilish
cunning he had also planned something
worse

ripley said that seeing cold murder
in kearsons eyes he was only too
glad to head into the bush as ordered but
he did not go far from camp shortly af-
ter noon he sighted flames and smoke he
waited until the next morning figuring
that by then kearson would be well on his
way then he cautionsly approached the
camp he saw no sign of kearson smold-
ering ashes were all that remained of the
cabin he was then surprised to find the
rifle leaning against a tree it was fully
loaded then another thing surprised him
at its usual mooring he saw their canoe
he picked up the rifle got into the canoe
and headed for my post

  to me ripleys story seemed utterly
preposterous i did not tell him so but
ordered him to guide me back to the
bumed-out camp when we arrived i
poked about in the cabins ashes and
discovered to my amazement the charred
remains of a human being

  while i had been poking around ripley
had remained seated on a log nursing the
rifle and eyeing my every movement he
was in a highly nervous condition i saw
that he had not noticed my discovery i
walked over to him and asked him to show
me their cache in it i found several
pouches of raw gold a later assay proved
it to be worth two thousand nine hundred
dollars there was also a supply of food
in the cache

  that intensified my doubt of ripleys
story i managed to separate him from the

romances	

rifle then told him of the body i had
found he appeared terribly shocked i led
him to the corpse and compelled him to
help me lift it clear of the ruins

  mounties have to be customs officers
coroners and everything else as well as
being policemen i performed a rough-
and-ready post-mortem on the body and
it wasnt a nice job a burned human form
is unpleasant to handle this one was al-
most totally consumed every bit of skin
and flesh had been burned from the skull
and the corpse was completely unrecog-
nizable

  but the autopsy brought to light a damn-
ing piece of evidence-a small hole in
the carbonized skull it had been made by
a -calibre rifle bullet i found the
smashed bit of lead i asked ripley what
he had to say to that he stuck to his
story

  i hunted around in the ashes again
and unearthed a number of tell-tale articles
where the body had lain signet ring
watch and other personal effects after
cleaning them ripley identified them as
having once belonged to his partner kear-
son he offered as explanation that some-
one might have overheard him and kear-
son quarrelling and kearsons plan also
learned of the amount of gold on hand
after seeing ripley head into the bush
this unknown had shot kearson and taken
most of the gold had in fact carried
out in part kearsons own plans i
thought this suggestion a bit too thin and
placed ripley under arrest

  in the first place for all i knew the
gold i had found constituted the total
amount in the second place the burned
man had received a bullet through the head
in the third place the canoe had not been
taken other points were ripley had fol-
lowed the safest plan remained in the dis-
trict and reported the crime himself pre-
tending ignorance of a corpse in the ruins
had he left it to chance for the crime
to be discovered and a check-up of my
district showed he had run for it he would
have been apprehended for it is almost
impossible for a wanted man to avoid
eventual arrest no matter what part of the
world he goes to your clever criminal al-
ways pays a lot of attention to that last
point plans to avoid even the faintest sus-
picion the ignorant crook commits a


murder without penalty

crime then runs for supposed safety a
foolish thing- to do

  at the time i thought ripley had made
a serious mistake in not smashing in the
burned skull before reporting at my post
and not telling a simple story that he had
returned from a hunting trip and found
the cabin burned and the body of his
partner in it i thought that he had alto-
gether over-played his part

  we buried the charred remains along-
side the grave of martin the aged pros-
pector owing to the stony nature of the
ground we could not dig a deep grave
so as ripley and kearson had done for
martin we piled rocks on top to prevent
wild animals from molesting the corpse
i then took ripley to my post

  while holding him there awaiting word
from the outside i had all our fellows
working hard to try to find out if any-
one had disappeared recently not that
we can keep tabs on everyone in the
north its a big country and harbors
many people who prefer to remain un-
known the result of the check-up was
that no known person had died that sum-
mer and most significant no one had
ever heard of an aged prospector named
martin

  i tackled ripley about it asked him
why either he or kearson had not re-
ported to my post at once when martin
had died ripley replied that the gold
fever had got into them and they hated
to waste the time they intended to do
so on their way out in the fall

  his answer raised the question in my
mind as to whether the grave he had
shown me as being martins wasnt just
part of a shrewd killers plan i doubted
the old prospector part of his story from
that moment later investigation proved
that grave to be empty but the fact was
not learned until months later for several
feet of snow made it impossible to lo-
cate and open the hole just then

murder is a grave charge and exe-
cutions are ghastly affairs i had
charged ripley with murder i wanted
to give him every chance to prove his
innocence if he was innocent i tried my
best to get his viewpoint but the more
i thought about it the worse it looked
for him

  a fellow who worked at a crematorium
once told me of the terrific heat required
to reduce a corpse to ashes there is not
one case on record of human bodies being
totally destroyed in burned buildings but
few people know of this physical fact
i came to the conclusion that the aged
prospector curtis martin had never ex-
isted that ripley and kearson had hap-
pened on a good claim by chance that
when it petered out ripley shot kear-
son then attemped to hide all traces of
his crime by trying to destroy kearsons
corpse by fire noting that there were
charred remains to tell a tale he had pad-
died to my post conjuring up his story on
the way

  i told ripley my conclusions but he
stuck to his story

  a few weeks later i was ordered to
take him to edmonton alberta to stand
trial

  i was the chief witness the crown
prosecutor made ten points out of every
word i said and hammered home each
point

  ripley had been found in possession
of raw gold food a loaded -calibre
rifle and a canoe means to kill and run
instead of taking flight he had attempted
the safest plan remained in the district
and himself brought the police to the
scene of the crime such an act proved
that the accused had planned his das-
tardly crime with consummate nerve and
skill for months for reason of personal
gain he had schemed to murder his part-
ner the story ripley had told to the police
was preposterous

  ripley liad a good defense counsel and
he did his best but he hadnt an argu-
ment left after the prosecution got
through he argued that the post-mortem
had been performed by a policeman with-
out the slightest training in medicine he
tried other arguments he then tried to
get the charge reduced to manslaughter
stating that his client had admitted to
quarreling bitterly with his partner it
was useless the jury brought in a verdict
of murder on november   and
ripley was sentened to be hanked by the
neck until he was dead as is usual in
canada the date of the execution was
set three months ahead-february 

northwest romances



  i was commended for my good work
and given thirty days furlough i de-
cided to spend my leave in edmonton
and have my teeth attended to i went to
my usual dentist while working on me
he talked a lot about the ripley case
which had aroused wide interest and
then he casually mentioned a simple fact
that made me jump higher than any of
his drilling-the simple fact that no mat-
ter how badly a corpse is burned it is
rarely that sound teeth are destroyed
i had barely glanced at the jaws of the
remains i had found in my haste to get
an unpleasant job over and done with

  after thinking the matter over i jour-
neyed to the fort saskatchewan gaol
a few miles outside edmonton where rip-
ley was confined he was very decent to
me he told me that kearson had pos-
sessed a perfect set of teeth also though
he added that there was no doubt in his
mind but that the charred remains i had
found were those of kearson that as-
sertation made me wonder if he was on
the point of breaking down and confess-
ing i talked to hirri for a long time but
he persisted he was innocent i still did
not believe him

had been back at my post about two
months when i was notified that the
date of ripleys execution had been set
forward to permit further investigation
of the case ripleys counsel had appealed
on the grounds that the autopsy on the
remains had been made by a man un-
skilled in medicine myself and the court
of appeal had upheld him the news
brought me wonderful relief

  in june the chief surgeon of the
northern detachments accompanied by a
private doctor and ripleys counsel ar-
rived at my post i took them to the
scene of the crime i insisted that we
open the grave supposed to contain mar-
tins remains first it was as i thought
empty ripleys counsel who had ham-
mered me hard all through the trial paled
a bit at that we then opened the other
grave it contained the remains i had
found in the charred embers of the shack

  in the clearing the two medical men
held their post-mortem it was then my
turn to get a jolt the upper and lower

jaws contained not one single tooth

  of course we had only the word of
a man fighting to save his neck from the
noose that kearson had possessed perfect
teeth on the other hand victims of scurvy
invariably lose their teeth lefore they die

  i worked furiously from then on i
got a detailed description of kearson
from ripley and had it circulated weeks
later he was picked up in montreal he
broke down and confessed to what we
all suspected after the last post-mortem
he had dug up martins coqxse put a
bullet through the skull then placed it in
the shack and set fire to the building

  kearson had committed an almost per-
fect crime he had avoided suspicion by
having substituted a corpse and a few
personal trinkets which would lead the
police to believe that the body was that
of himself he had left the canoe be-
hind and made his way outside by the
simple procedure of walking thirty miles
or so upstream to a native camp there
he hired a canoe and two indian padd-
lers he changed his name and reported
at some of our posts on his way to rail-
head at waterways as there was no hue
and cry out for a man corresponding
to his appearance he was treated with
the courtesy accorded any other traveller

  but with all his cunning kearson made
one serious mistake-that of substituting
the body of an aged toothless man for
his own and he is now entirely outside
the protection of the law for this tech-
nical but legal reason

  charles ripley had been brought to
trial for murdering a man named harold
kearson he had been found guilty and
sentenced to be hanged the discovery
that kearson was still alive and the con-
fession he made caused the authorities to
have ripleys sentence quashed under
our law if a man has his sentence quashed
he cannot be tried and sentenced again
for the same crime

  kearson was tried convicted and sen-
tenced on two charges robbery and mach-
ination he served his sentence and is
again a free man therefore if ripley
murdered kearson tomorrow the law
could not touch him because of the near
perfection of his crime kearson is today
entirely outside the protection of the law

by dan cushman

 the stormtcind cache i a quarter-ton of hidden yellow gold jackpot bait
 for hungry adventurers jim ryan swapped his forty-dollar seattle suitcase
 for a packsack and moosehide mucks    and found himself riding a skin

boat into the mouth of hell

jim ryan had reached moyukuk
city the hard way

hed taken a train up the narrow
gauge from telaqua bay at apex hed
swapped his forty-dollar seattle suitcase
for a packsack and a pair of moosehide
mucks and had traveled afoot northward
through the squawman hills it was mid-
night and hed been thirty-six hours with-
out food when he finally waded across
windrows of thawing placer gravel to
moyukuks one long street hed saved ten
days by not waiting for the river steam-
boat but hed paid for every hour of it

seattle had left him soft his legs
ached his back was stiff he spat and

laughed from one side of his mouth and
cursed

  ryan he said to himself here you are
back again after all the brags you made
youre back and worse than being back
youre broke ryan youre a great lad in
adversity but prosperity is more than you
can stand ryan what you need is some-
one to stand beside you what you really
need is someone to stand behind you and
kick your seat higher than your shoulders

  he was about thirty he was six feet
tall though a breadth of frame developed in
the timber camps ofwashingtonmade him
seem short his face was slightly battered
and it had a pleasing ugliness a couple of


	northwest romances

his teeth had been kicked out and replaced
with gold he had formed the habit of
carrying a twig match or toothpick in
one corner of his mouth giving the perpe-
tual impression of just having left the
dinner table

  it was a twig he was carrying now he
spat it away hitched up his sourdough
pants and waded the alaska muck to the
front door of sky-noo sammys bar and
raffle

  midnight had brought with it a half-
darkness so lamps were lighted shining
ruddily through the smoked-up windows

  he kicked the door open and stood with
his packsack balanced on one shoulder
looking around

  sky-noos was a battered plank-and-
tincup saloon with a sour smell of beer and
stale tobacco but it was home to ryans
nostrils and he breathed deeply of it just
as hed breathed the odor of the coastal
forest when he got off the boat at telaqua
bay

  a rawboned muck-smeared miner saw
him and bellowed my gawd its ryan
there he is the old billy-be-damned gug-
genheim himself back for another ton of
chilliwook gold or did them slickers in
the states roll you for a chechako and
skid you out the back door

  the miner had guessed it theyd rolled
him all right and theyd given him the
skids

  with a grandiose gesture ryan pitched
his warbag to the corner and shouted to
the bar all of you sammy throw away
that eopard milk and set out the best you
have in the house bonded kentucky
thats what ryan buys for his friends he
then turend his attention to the rawboned
miner travis those seattle necktie-punks
never saw the hour they could roll a son of
the ryans and skid him from the back
door with his pockets plucked

  he was thinking that hed got out of
seattle in good shape however thered
been a girl named irene in san francisco
a horse named best regards at tijuana
and a pair of dice that refused to come up
little joe over in carson city and in
all of those places thered been champagne
ryan still felt a little throb in his head
at the thought of champagne

  he took paper money from his mack-

inaw pocket and slammed on the bar in
the manner of one who draws on a bottom-
less supply actually it was almost the
end of a twelve thousand dollar stake hed
left the country with

  after taking on a couple of bourbons
ryan said its old dave carson im
looking for the friend of my heart i
grubstaked up on porcupine creek a sick
man he is and im taking him back to the
states

  the poker game had got under way
again but at mention of dave carson a
squat black-whiskered prospector tossed
in his cards and walked over slightly splay
footed in his mucklucks

  you mean theres something wrong
with dave i saw him ten-twelve days
ago at tonka landing he didnt look sick
to me

  come to think of it ryan didnt know
what was wrong with dave either it
was just that a telegram had been wait-
ing for him in telaqua-

byan theyre after me if you want to see
me alive be in moyukuk by the fifteenth dave

  until that moment ryan thought it
had been the black cough or whiskey or
some other hazard of thecountry now
the message hit him with new significance
he wondered-then he shrugged it off
nobodyd be after dave he didnt have
an enemy in the world

  ryan said what days this eight-
eenth he should be here in town

  nobody had seen him the steamboat
had come down but dave hadnt been on it

  sammy grussman the proprietor a
red-headed irish jew was looking at him
grimly from behind the bar i dont want
to worry you ryan but i heard something
you remember that russian breed they
call johnny louse well he came down
from that porcupine country on the tail
end of the big chinook and said dave had
gone crazy

  crazy

  thats what he said of course i
didnt put too much weight in it because
the louse isnt too bright himself but he
said dave had it in his head somebody
was trying to kill him wait now wait
until you hear the rest and decide for
yourself whether daves crazy he thought
somebody was after him trying to kill him
bonanza



for something he had want to know what
it was 

  of course i want to know

  now ryan steady yourself they
were after a girdle

  you mean one of those things like a
corset that women-

  dont ask me about girdles im not the
one thats just been to the states im tell-
ing you what louse said a girdle and do
you know who carson thought was killing
him to get it back a girl a white girl
with black hair and blue eyes and from
the way dave talked about her she didnt
need any damned girdle

  everyone was hee-hawing about it
heat and tobacco smoke and liquor com-
bined to make ryan feel unsteady he
got outside by himself and let his head
clear

  dave hadnt gone crazy he wasnt that
kind he was in trouble he was in a
whole hell of a lot of trouble or hed never
have sent the telegram

yan spent a third of his remain-
ing cash for an outfit and betore
noon the next day he set out paddling a
canoe upriver toward tonka landing

  the kuskokwim flowed between great
barren hills snow still lay in the gullies
and a ceaseless wind cold and damp blew
down on him making his teeth chatter des-
pite his mackinaw despite the springtime
sun swinging around the horizon

  he slept at a siwash fishing camp lulled
by the wind and the steady creak of the
fishwheels through the short hours of
twilight and night he went on fighting
the high current of midstream hunting
the quiet waters near shore picking his
way through vast accumulations of drift-
wood from the high waters of other
years fatigue lay like paralysis and pain
in his body but he went on and fatigue
left him as his body toughened and the
fatty poisons of civilization were sweated
off

  the country to the north and east be-
came more rugged broad valleys were
choked with cottonwoods just coming to
bud he passed the hundred mouths of the
neversink and on the third evening he
brought his canoe up to some steamboat
docks with the log and shanty town of

tonka landing on the hillside beyond

  the warehouse and telegraph office of
the yukon transportation company had a
new coat of red barn paint but nothing
else seemed to have changed the same
loafers were on the bench at gilligans
the same gaunt malemutes barked and
showed their fangs from the pens by cul-
tus charleys

  he went inside the ramshackle two-
story hotel and found the owner blind
tom addison behind the desk

  blind tom a scarecrow tall man with
a grayish complexion recognized his voice
and cackled so you come back like dave
said well they all do sooner or later once
they have this yukon muck in their blood-
streams

  he shook toms hand and said daves
here then

  he was here the cheerfulness left
him that was bettern a week ago he
wasnt drunk and happy like he used to
be though

  sick

  no-o got a room and stayed there
used to send the injun out for likker sit
there and drink it by himself but it didnt
get him drunk when a man drinks and
doesnt get drunk theres something bother-
ing him then one morning- he
snapped his fingers gone just gone
left owing me twenty-two dollars of
course hed be welcome to stay here a
year if he was broke but just walking
out isnt like him well maybe he went to
moyukuk

  i just came up from moyukuk he
found a twenty and two silvers pressed it
in the blind mans hand

  oh hell im not worried-

  take it i grubstake him you know
ryan signed for a room and paused a
quarter way up the rickety stairs with his
packsack on his shoulder

  did dave say anything about a black-
haired girl cliasing him to get her erirdle
back

  blind tom doubled over from laughter
oh hell ryan you ought to know bettern
that daves too old for that kind of stuff
theyre never to old to talk about it
ryan climbed the stairs and walked
down the hall even in summer it was
draughty and cold one winter hed stayed
northwest romances

in the hotel when the thermometer in this
upper hall stood at twenty-two below

  he sat around in the room smoked
and thought about dave he chewed a
match and looked out the window it was
cheerless and gray with a line cold rain
falling he lighted a lamp and looked at
himself in the piece of rusty mirror he
had a three-day growth of whiskers he
was hungry but he didnt feel like eating
dave was the best friend hed ever had
and slowly the certainty had been rising in
him that he was dead

  he cursed and without realizing what
he was going to do turned and swung
his fist to one of the door panels he
hadnt done that since he was a show-off
kid the panel was split and two of his
knuckles bled he laughed at himself but
he felt better

  he went to the american bar and drank
whiskies the swamper had a barber chair
in a back room so he spent a dollar on
a shave half the men in tonka were at
the american by then but nobody was
able to tell him about dave

  it was past midnight when he groped
back to his room through the dark hotel

  there was no lock on the door nobody
ever locked a door in alaska he went
inside closed the door with his heel and
took the chewed-up match from his teeth
to light the lamp suddenly he realized
there was someone in the room

  he started back hand by habit going
to the place at his waist where hed carried
the  smith  wesson on his way up-
river but the gun wasnt there hed
left it in his warsack

  the click of gun hammer stopped him
then a voice followed it from the black-
ness stand where you are

  sure i got no gun

  well i have dont make me use it

  ryan remembered the voice from some-
where it had been a long time before
down in the timber camps in bc or
washington or off port orford it was
too dark to get even a shadow impression
of him but he was a heavy man ryan
could tell that by the creak of the floor as
he moved

  a match flared up in his fingers he
lit the lamp put the chimney on ryan
still barely noticed his face au he could

see was the big round muzzle of gun aimed
at him it was a bulldog forty-five the
worlds most inaccurate firearm but at
that range it would cut him in half

  well ryan the man said with a
nasty smile so it is you

  ryan still had trouble placing him he
was in his middle thirties a rugged rangy
man with broad shoulders and he might
have been handomei f his face hadnt been
spoiled by a chin that was long and a
mouth too small the mouth and jaw re-
minded him of a picture hed once seen of
napoleon

  well ryan what the hell dont you
remember your old friends battles bill
battles texada inlet the andraes-me-
conochie timber war i remember you i
remember that night you lost those front
teeth fighting with big ole christopher-
son

  his eyes kept moving between the gun
and battles face you dont need that
thing pointed at me i hold no grudge for
the things that happened at texada i
never put faith in the story that you got
koval from behind anyhow its all
water over the falls

  oh that apparently battles had for-
gotten all about koval he gestured with
the vicious little barrel open your jacket
all right now turn the pockets out he
saw that ryan was unarmed put the gun
on the bed and sat down beside it

  ryan asked well what the hell do
you want of me

  he didnt get an answer after thinking
and running his tongue around his small
mouth battles said i hear you struck it
rich

  i hit a little pay streak enough for a
vacation outside

 you mean you left with twenty
thousand and went broke in one winter
ryan didnt like to be reminded he
thought of champagne and made a wry
face i dont know as its any of your
affair if youre here after what i got left
well take it and be damned he took
out what he had tossed it on the table-
crumped bills small change matches and
brass beer checks all mixed together

  battles didnt more than glance at it
he sat forward elbows on his thighs a
smile on his face that twisted his long
bonanza



loose jaw to one side

  tell me why you came back

  he cried i came back because i was
broke

battles picked up the gun he
cocked it and took aim at ryans fore-
head i never liked you ryan i wouldnt
mind killing you ever see anybody shot
right between the eyes it leaves a big
black hole like the burnt end of a cigar
and the back of your head-

  put the gun down it made ryan sick
the gun its deadly black muzzle and
battles leering behind it

  ill put it down when you tell me what

i	want to know you didnt come back
because you were broke you came back
because old dave carson ran onto a cache
just twice as big and you thought maybe
youd get your hooks into it

  so youre the one thats been after old
dave

  battles didnt answer he sat with his
lips twisted down the gun aimed im
going to count ten you start talking you
tell me all about it well see how much
talking you can get done before i reach
ten if i think its enough youll walk out
of here alive otherwise- he jiggled the
gun hammer and dont forget to tell
what it was dave sent you down in
talaqua bay

  he sent me a telegram saying he didnt
expect to live long and now its easy
enough to see why

  battles counting slowly reached four
you better get to talking five

  i tell you-

  what was that package he sent you
six

  he sent me no package if he did i
didnt receive it i had him grubstaked on
the porcupine and-

  seven

  put the gun down you damn fool if
you killed me what then what good
would i be to you dead 

  what good would you be alive unless
you tell if you were dead you wouldnt
be running to the us marshal saying i
was here eight im waiting ryan
nine

  his finger had cocked on the trigger
the tension of his arm telegraphing itself

along the gun barrel made a tiny tremble

  ryan had turned hot and cold sick and
sweaty but at ten the fear left him he
took a deep breath beyond the gun battles
eyes liad been the eyes of a killer but he
didnt fire he jerked back his head with a
laugh and said

  you win ryan  you got guts havent
you you got more guts than i gave you
credit for

  ryan felt dizzy his ears buzzed now
that the danger was temporarily removed
he was hot and sweaty again it was so
hot he had a hard time getting air to
breathe

  a sound at the door behind him made
him gather his faculties battles heard it
too and spoke

  shorty

  an unfamiliar husky voice answered
yeah

  well come in

  the door opened admitting a small
graying man with perfect fragile features
he seemed slightly jittery he brought
with him the whiskey smell of one who
had practically lived on the stuff for weeks
months even years

  well shorty asked find anything
out

  no but we will draw your gun
shorty and get behind him

  shorty carried a colt in a halfbreed
holster beneath his left armpit hidden by
his mackinaw the holster had a spring
mechanism designed to snap the gun up-
ward when the catch was released and
shorty almost lost it on the floor he got
it with a stab of his hand and wheeled
with it aiming at ryans back his finger
was so hard on the trigger it rocked the
double-acting hammer half way back

  ryan hissed be careful

  battles laughed he said stand up
raise your hands

  the ceiling was low and ryans fingers
almost brushed it

  what was it that carson sent you in
telaqua

  how many times do i have to say-
battles moved suddenly hed lowered
the gun now he brought it around in a
raking backhand swing

ryan saw it too late and tried to weave
aside the gun hit him the forward
	northwest romances

sight ripped him from the base of his
jaw across his cheek the bridge of his
nose

  it sent him staggering for a second he
forgot about shorty about the colt aimed
at his back he caught himself after two
half-steps and arms lowered started to-
ward battles battles was ready for him
he brought the gun back down and
clubbed him to the floor

  ryan had no recollection of falling he
was just there on hands and knees the
room spun around him

  get up he heard battles say

  he got as far as his kness effort made
him black out pain was a whirlpool in-
side his skull behind his eyes he could
hear battles voice it beat on his eardrums
but the words didnt get through to his
brain

  battles stood in front of him his logger
boots set wide he lifted one of the boots
ryan saw it coming he was like a man
in a nightmare whose muscles refuse to
answer to his will he couldnt move the
boot smashed him in the temple driving
him back against the wall

  where did he locate it battles was
asking for the third or fourth time

 locate-what ryan shouted the
words locate what

  battles hissed quiet or ill kill you
where did he locate the stormwind gold 

  there was a thud of feet running along
the hall he tried to get to his feet
shorty had his back turned propping a
chair under the door knob ignoring the
guns ryan lunged forward but battles
met him and slugged him to the wall he
tried to cover up as battles repeatedly
drove his hobs to the side of his head

ii

ryan was a long time coming awake
finally he sat up somebody had
placed a cold cloth over his face

  he said with his tongue feeling thick
where am i

  alaska said blind tom at his elbow

  he managed to laugh the sun was shin-
ing just edging the horizon coming
through the smoky window pane it hurt
his eyes his neck hurt when he turned
all his teeth ached they didnt mesh

hed taken beatings before and it had
been like that his lower teeth werent
built in the same contour as his uppers
and they pained him at each uncomformity

  he got out of bed finding a handhold on
the bedpost until a wave of blackness left
his brain he looked at himself in the
mirror his face was lopsided there were
several deep welts oozing blood from his
left earlobe to the bridge of his nose both
cheeks and his right temple were pocked
from hobs and turning purplish

  now theres a case of timberjack
measles for you he said thats the
worst ive had since big louie lamotte
worked me over with an ox yoke down
in aberdeen

  who are they tom asked

  bill battles and some old fellow he
called shorty he turned from the mirror
and asked is tonka without the law these
days 

  theres krause the us commis-
sioner

  you didnt call him

  i didnt want to until you came around
it might be some private quarrel and-
sure tom thats just as well im
developing a certain fondness for the
thought of taking care of this by myself
his room has been ransacked warsack
emptied things trod on kicked to comers
of the room his money was still on the
table his smith  wesson was on the
floor they hadnt found what they were
looking for because whatever it was old
dave hadnt sent it thered only been
the telegram

 a memory of something returned
battles had asked a question about storm-
wind he repeated the word stormwind
blind tom hearing him said now
youre out looking for the stormwind
cache are you ryan

  that was it he snapped his fingers at
the memory the stormwind cache

  story of the cache dated back to the
days of the first gold miners before the
klondike rush it was a legend something
that everyone talked about and only half
believed

  four prospectors were supposed to have
come down the yukon from circle city
with a quarter-ton of gold at that time
living in unakitleet was an outlaw colony
bonanza	

of salmon and fur pirates a group of
twenty of these scoundrels had camped on
the yukon and seeing the prospectors
bateau they attacked after an all-day
floating battle the prospectors escaped on
shore near the flattail muskegs and un-
der cover of the short summer night
tried to get out of sight in the scrub
timber covering the kuskokwim divide

  the pirates however picked up their
trail and fell on them again near the head-
waters of stormwind creek this time
the propectors were killed but they had
cached their gold which was never found

  that was one of the stories there were
twenty others for instance hed heard
that one of the men had escaped and re-
turned later to spend his life hunting
fruitlessly for the cache that one had
crawled off to die in an indian village
that hed escaped and died behind the bars
of the bc provincial asylum ryan could
even recall some gaudy headlines a few
years back when a convict at walla walla
claiming to be stormwind survivor con-
vinced a group of seattle businessmen
who used their influence to gain his parole
and subsequently took them for eight
thousand dollars in a variation of the old
spanish trunk racket
he said tom do you think theres
anything to that stormwind story

  the blind man laughed well maybe
but id rather go up to circle and sluice
my own quarter-ton of gold itd be easier
that way

  ryan saw no more of battles he stayed
in town recuperating from his beating
hoping that dave carson would learn he
was there and show himself when two
days passed and no word of him he went
upriver to the mouth of the comeluck and
thence up that swift silt-milky stream to
porcupine flats there an aleut half-
breed caught up with him bringing the
news dave carsons drowned body had
been washed up on the rocks below three
pillar rapids

  hed already been buried in the mission
yard of st pauls five miles downstream
when ryan got there

i want the body exhumed ryan said
his request angered the jesuit he
stood a big thick-necked man with his
back to the wind and his cassock blowing

around him and said nonsense ryan
i hate to turn a good irishman down
but what good could it possibly do the
man was drowned im not untrained at
medicine and-

  i dont doubt your word he was
drowned but they did it look at my face
look at the beating they handed me do
you think theyd come around and work
me over if they could still get to dave
whether they killed him or not they at
least knew he was dead when they came
from me

  after some consideration the jesuit said
very well and called to a couple of
siwash boys who were repairing the shake
roof in an hour their shovels revealed
dave in his rough board coffin

  he was dressed in the same sourdoughs
shirt and mackinaw hed worn when hed
been washed up on the crags women at
the mission had washed and pressed them
and put them back on him his boots were
still damp they were heavy ten-inch high-
cuts

  ryan pointed to them you see he
cracked up in no canoe ive seen him go
barefoot rather than injure a canoe with
heavy heels

  ryan searched him felt the seams of
his clothes slitted his boot soles taking
them off a layer of leather at a time

  the jesuit watching him said what
were you looking for 

  just looking

  a key

  dave didnt own a lock what would he
do with a key 

  i forgot to tell you but there was a
small brass key inside the lining of his
mackinaw i thought it had slipped through
his pocket

  ryan sat beneath the missions pole
awning all afternoon smoking feeling the
key in his pocket trying to get from his
mind the picture of daves drowned face

  suddenly he cried fort baker the
cudahay company had some lock boxes
there when they ran their express line
what ever happened to them 

  why theyre still there if anybody
wants to use them in the store

it was twilight and ryan had traveled
all day with muscles heavy from
	northwest

fatigue he turned his canoe ashore and
camped on a dry hummock among cotton-
woods

  he built a fire siwashed a salmon hed
bought earlier at an indian fishwheel and
with midnight sun still hanging on the
horizon rolled up in his rabbitskin blanket
to sleep

  he awoke suddenly and sat up he
didnt know what had awakened him

  the sun had slipped behind the mount-
ain horizon for the nearest approach one
had to night at that season a luminous
twilight reflected from the sky the river

  he listened ears straining the river
made a perpetual roar there was a slight
wind in the cottonwood branches a coal
popped in a dying fire a whisky jack
fluttered and chattered

  his hand groping beneath the blanket
found the cold steel of the revolver he
felt better then holding the gun he
kicked the blanket aside stood and spent
another three or four minutes listening

  he dressed and circled following the
river shore for almost half a mile looking
for the impressions of feet in the mud
there was little chance anyone would ap-
proach his camp from the river and ap-
parently no one had

  he laughed at himself and tried to
escape the impression that someone was be-
hind him in the timber watching each
move he made hed traveled too hard of
late he hadnt been eating enough he
hadnt had the whisky an irishman needed
to keep him going in this country and
the sight of dave carsons drowned face
had affected him more deeply than he
thought

  stretched in his blanket thinking these
things he finally fell asleep when he
awoke the first thing he noticed was a
bright strand of hair tangled in willow
blowing in the gentle breeze

  a spiderweb he thought knowing quite
well that it wasnt he pulled it free it
was a hair almost black about two feet
long

  and while he stood running the hair
through his fingers sky-noos words came
back -a white girl with black hair and
blue eyes

  he looked at his duffle nothing had
been disturbed his canoe was as it had

romances

been bottom up on the shore no sign of
moccasin tracks he tried to forget it but
felt someone watching watching   

there was no town at baker just the
ruined army barracks overlooking the
river from a high shoulder of ground the
long log trading post and half a dozen
driftwood shanties occupied by a branch
of the dogrib tribe from the hill country
to the north

  it had been three years since ryan had
come down from his claim on porcupine
so he had to spend some time renewing
acquaintances with the proprietor a huge
filthy man known as swede nels

  he dropped the key on the counter and
said i think dave left something here
nels said yah sure and without
hesitation started stacking aside sack after
sack of dog meal to get at some old
fashioned express lock boxes by golly
ay almost forgot dave did come in har
and put something away

  when was he here 

  couple month ago maybe only sax
weeks there bane plenty snow for sled
runner ay know that much

  mushed down

  yah

  nels kept trying the key in one lock
after another until he found one that it fit
the lock box contained something in an
old brown paper sack nels tossed it over
to him

  he left that old nanuck dog of his
sore foot you can pick her up if you like
charge you two dollar for feed nels
didnt seem to attach much importance to
the package he said so old dave bane
dead and gone by yimminy thats hell
ryan looked at the sack his fingers
trembled a little it wasnt like him to lose
nerve he wanted to rip the package open
and see what was inside but there was an
indian a stranger in the big trade room
so he checked himself

  to make an excuse he said ill take a
look at that malemute and went outside

  he walked to the dog pens opened the
sack and pulled out its contents there was
a single article-a piece of squaw bead-
work he unfolded it a strip of soft-
rubbed buckskin looked at one side and
then the other hed expected a message
bonanza



he could see none he turned the sack
inside out nothing there either

  he felt disappointed and let down he
stood by the dog pens folding and un-
folding the beaded strip wondering if
sky-noo hadnt been right about dave
after all this thing was a masterpiece of
the beadworkers art worth maybe twenty
dollars at the curio stores down at cook
inlet but it was nothing a sffne man
would carry down from porcupine and lock
in an express box

  it seemed to be very old the buckskin
had almost lost its in j un-smoke odor it
was browned and turned rather crystal-
line from age apparently it had never
been worn it was a belt or a collarpiece
about as long as his arm four inches wide
in the center and tapering to half that
width at ends which were fitted with tie
strings of pliant caribou tendon the front
was a solid mass of beads a pale blue
background worked with figures symbol-
ical of men animals canoes trees and
igloos in red purple and orange

  finally he rolled it up and thrust it in
his pocket that last winter of loneliness
had done it dave had gone crazy trying
to find the long end of a square quilt as
the saying went

  ryan sat at swede nels big rough-
board table eating lutefisk and drinking
home brew the swede was half drunk as
hed been off and on for two days in the
background moving quietly keeping more
home brew ready was nels wife a full-
blood aleut from kulakak bay

  for what must have been an hour with
no pause except to pour more home brew
down his throat nels had recounted his
adventures in the harvest fields of noord
dakota then while taking apart fargo
board for board he forgot his story and
got to bellowing the interminable verses
of a song each alternate stanza of which
ended in the words

  yah yah vat skal ve ha

  olga on a buggyride yah yah yah i

  ryan finally got up and went outside
it still frosted each night and the cold
felt good to him he didnt want to stay
there any longer but he didnt know which
way to turn

  the piece of beadwork made a lump in
his hip pocket for the twentieth time that
day he took it out to examine it the
sun had set but enough light remained
in the sky for him to make out the intricate
bead tracings

  he kept walking paying little attention
to his destination until he was stopped by
a heap of fence rails near the malemute
pens one old gray and tan with his
forepaws on the wire high as a mans
head was barking with his fangs peeled
back

  it surprised ryan for the malemute
had seen him enough to grow used to him

  suddenly he realized that there was
someone else moving in the shadow be-
hind him

  he turned with his hand dropping in-
stinctively to the smith  wesson then
he saw the gleam of a gun barrel aimed
at him and a girls voice spoke

  dont try anything dont try to call
i have a gun aimed at your heart i
wouldnt hesitate to shoot

  he recovered himself enough to laugh
but not enough to put his heart behind it
ill wager you wouldnt girl and what
do i have that you could want

  that thing in your hand

  this

  yes the girdle ill take it

  her words hit him like a blow between
the eyes hed been a fool his mind had
been on the girdles hed seen pictured in
catalogues but this indian belt could be a
girdle too

  give it to me i she hissed

  why sure girl he turned with it
holding it at arms length hoping she
would step forward to take it she wasnt
tempted she stood crouched forward in-
tent like a spring drawn and triggered

  bring it here

  he moved slowly and with a change of
position he had a better view of her

  she was a slim girl no more than an
inch or so over five feet she had small
excellently cut features no indian blood
her skin for that country was very light
she was dressed in high moccasins white
wool sox folded down below the knees
gave her calves a stocky appearance she
wore a buckskin skirt and jacket on her
head was a mackinaw wool cap her dark
	northwest romances

hair had been plaited and wrapped in a
coil but it was too luxuriant to remain
hidden and the cap gave the appearance of
perching atop of it her eyes might have
been blue but in the half light they seemed
black

she was excited and fighting to keep
the excitement down ryan could tell
that by her rapid breathing by the way she
kept biting down on her lip

  girl he said youre welcome to the
thing but tell me what are you doing a
girl like you traveling with the kind you
are what would a young girl like you
be doing with robbery and murder

  she cried with sudden angry defense
i have nothing to do with murder
then you wouldnt pull the trigger
toss it here

  the gun was clenched too tightly her
finger too hard on the trigger he didnt
want to push his luck

  all right catch it

  he tossed the rolled-up squaw girdle in-
tentionally a trifle to her right she might
try to reach and catch it and in that case
the gun might be turned for a second giv-
ing him his chance she didnt move it
struck the ground behind her a yard or
more to her right

  she did not change hands with the gun
she didnt try to bend and reach around
with her left she backed with the gun
still aimed came around it until it was in
front of her then she crouched and picked
it up

  he said its a small tiling the girdle
but still its robbery at gunpoint there is
nothing for me to do now except get the
united states marshal and run you down
she laughed at him and tossed her head
back youre not scaring me what
united states marshal would hunt down a
girl for taking such a thing

  it was true hed be laughed out of
alaska

  she backed around until she was on the
river side the malemute had stopped bark-
ing and now he started again there was a
gate to the dog pens held on the outside
by a prop-pole with heel he felt the prop
pole behind him and was tempted to drop
the gate and let the dog loose on her the
animal savage as he sounded wouldnt

actually attack her but hed get tier
turned away with the gun

  ryan hesitated and took his foot away
capturing her would do no good he
couldnt keep her prisoner he couldnt turn
her over to the law

  she shouted to be heard over the dog
frenzy dont movel i can see you all
the way from the river ill shoot if you
try to follow me

  she moved backward over hummocky
moss and stones a canoe had been pulled
in to shore among some flooded willows at
fifty yards she turned and watching bade
across her shoulder ran to it ryan could
have drawn and with the  blasted the
canoe bottom out

  now thinking clearly for the first time
in days he knew it would do him no good
to get the girdle back he had no idea
what value it had it would be better to
let her have it and follow her that would
be the tough part following her not
letting her get away along those trackless
rivers of the north

  he watched her slide the canoe from
the willows leap in and crouching drive
the paddle with sharp strength and skill
that sent the craft light as bubble into
the current holding a level course across
and downstream

  he ran to the trading house swede
nels beating the table with  his fists was
belowing out another ballad

  ryan threw his duffle together and
was outside in a quarter minute the
canoe was a shadow strip near the far
bank he launched his own canoe then
not wanting her to know she was being
followed he waited for what seemed to
be a long time as she approached the
downstream bend

ill

eor the first few miles it was quite
t dark with a few stars out then the
sun edged upward spreading a rose col-
ored dawn over the water the girl was
far ahead driftlogs made it impossible
to spot her canoe but occassionally his eyes
caught the sun-flash of her paddle

  he kept catching brief glimpses of her
until it was noon and hed passed the
mouth of the hsluika a swift treacherous
stream flowing down from the hill country
bonanza



to the north

  beaching his canoe he climbed a pro-
montory and looked both ways along miles
of river flowing between great barren
banks to the south the country rolled
away in vast undulations toward the ahk-
lun mountains to the north lay the sharply
dissected pine and rock country of porcu-
pine ridge and the stonnwinds

  no sign of the canoe thought that
she had pulled up to rest along one of the
cottonwood studded banks made him wait
rolling and smoking one cigarette after
another fighting down a natural impa-
tience

  no sign of her she had turned off
at the hsluika

  ryan was a good man with a canoe
taller than he looked with a strength that
gave him a long-reaching power on the
paddle but still the booming stream re-
peatedly fought him to a standstill he
was forced to use a pikepole he went
ahead with the babiche line towing it past
riffles and rapids wading waist deep in
the icy flood

  through wet-slick moccasins the rocks
of the river bruised his feet his body
ached from the cold water he kept driv-
ing on and on expecting her around each
sharp turn of the canyon walls but she
was never there at last with the sun
at the jagged horizon he fell face down
among the rocks on shore and rested

  he was protected from the wind that
blew a chilling blast on his wet clothes
but after half an hour he was forced to
get up and rub circuation into his mus-
cles he ate half of the smoked salmon
hed brought along put the rest away for
next day and wont on

  he kept cursing through his teeth he
was a fool he should turn back the girl
had tricked him no girl could battle this
hsluika and keep ahead of him shed
hidden on shore watched him go past
and now she was gone swallowed by the
vastness of the north

  he pulled ashore climbed a steep shoul-
der of rock from which he could see
stretches of the river for several miles

  he glimpsed it there the canoe riding
with corklike buoyancy while the girl
maneuvering it this way and that utlilized
every crosscurrent to move upstream skirt-
ing crags by the merest breath finding

-northwest romances-winter

clearance along shore where ryan with
his greater weight would force a canoe
down and rip its bottom out

  tired as he was he laughed and shook
his head by the great gods of the north
how she could handle a canoe

  darkness in the canyon made him stop
he built a fire dried himself and slept
for a couple of hours

  he ate he had enough food left for
one meal wind carried an odor of wood-
smoke two hours later he found the
drenched embers of a fire under a shel-
tering bank he placed his hand on them
the charcoal was cold the rocks be-
neath barely warm shed been gone more
than an hour

  he no longer kept track of time he
fought the river until fatigue drugged
him he fell on the bank to rest and
then fought it some more it came night
he ate the last of his food his blanket
was watersoaked he sat between a fire
and the reflecting face of a cliff dozing
jerking awake to listen to the close howl-
ing of wolves

  at midmorning in the narrowing can-
yon he found a series of steplike water-
falls blocking his way

  there again he saw the blackened em-
bers of the fire he looked at them with
fatigue-dulled eyes and suddenly jerked
erect as he saw a thin veil of steam rising
from them they had been drenched only
a few minutes before

  he crouched with misty cold spray of
the cascades drifting over him and looked
around shed seen him approaching she
might be waiting behind rocks or scrub
spruce just above gun ready

  no sign of her canoe shed cached it
downstream and come on afoot

  there was a portage trail along cliffs
and rock banks to the right a steep trail
a switchback trail a mountain goat trail

  working swiftly he made a wolf pack
of rifle ammunition blanket and extra
clothing it seemed like nothing after port-
aging the canoe

  he climbed the footpath made a series
of close switchbacks until it gained an
elevation somewhat higher than the crest
of the cataracts then it followed a con-
tour of the side it still wasnt an easy
trail a man had to watch for footing
steplike up and down often with foot-
holds barely wider than his outspread
	northwest romances

hand with the river vertically below
churning itself to a white froth

  a bullet pinged against rock and
screamed away with a clap of explosion
following it

  instinctively he went to one knee he
found partial protection behind a bulge
of stone his hand went oyer his shoulder
pulling the rifle free of his pack

  two hundred yards away beyond a
jagged rock shoulder a puff of powder
smoke had appeared

  there was a second squirt of smoke
the bullet hit an instant later above him
so close it showered him with stinging bits
of rock and left an odor like burned sul-
phur

  he tossed the rifle to his shoulder
aimed high of her position pulled the
trigger it was a  winchester a moose
gun a grizzly gun its  grain slug
kicked a shower of rock and spruce litter
about three feet above her head it made
her flinch so her third shot was far wide

  he fired once more aiming at the
same spot then he lunged to his feet was
exposed for three perilous steps along
the cliff and with a leaping dive found
cover in a narrow crevice filled with
twisted spruce roots and wedged-in slide
rock

  he half stood half lay on his side boots
anchored and got his breath there was
just room in the crevice to hide him
he could feel both its walls when he
breathed bullets screamed down struck
repeatedly within a foot of his head show-
ering him with stone as they glanced
away

  he laughed ryan he said what
a woman you picked

  he rolled a cigarette of sodden paper
with sodden tobacco the cover of his
match can had worked loose and the
matches were crumbly from dampness

  he cursed tore the cigarette open
chewed the tobacco like snooce beneath
his lip

  the shooting stopped but still he didnt
show himself carefully feeling for each
foothold he climbed using the crevice
for protection until he reached the fringe
of spruce timber high on the mountain
side of the canyon

  he glimpsed her then a mile away
traveling swiftly through the big timber
of the bottoms

ryan stayed with the high coun-
try and kept her in sight watching
her leave false trail double back hunt the
rocky going then leave false trail again

  yes ryan there was a woman clever
as a cross fox

  she left the valley crossed the narrow
ridge of hsluika divide

  beyond hsluika a wild pattern of gul-
ches fanned into muskeg which still held
the frost of winter a few inches beneath
the surface

  he bound the driftwood trunks of cot-
tonwoods together and crossed a current-
less stream here again was hill country
covered by jacktimber

  he caught an odor of woodsmoke
trails laced the hillsides the benches and
bottoms were pockmarked by old placer
diggings

  these he knew were the old mucker
diggings discovered back in  by men
moving through alaska from the klon-
dike diggings now mucker was an out-
law town reputedly the home of half the
sluice robbers and fur thieves of the yu-
kon

  from high along a ridge he looked
down on the town

  it had once boasted more than a hun-
dred houses but now all except seventeen
or eighteen lay in ruins or had disap-
peared using only their sill logs to show
where they had stood one a long nar-
row building had the appearance of a
trading post there was a creek which
joined a river about two miles below
town it was the same river hed crossed
earlier that day only larger now swifter
at one time thered been another settle-
ment there but now all that remained
was a ramshackle boathouse the only
movement he saw was a man over there
puttering around an upended canoe

  twilight settled as he descended hunt-
ing concealment among the bench dig-
gings he stopped behind a dog shed
about fifty steps from the long log
building

  the odor of food struck his nostrils and
left him momentarily weak

  he dropped his pack and rifle male-
mutes were barking at him but he paid
no attention he crossed to the house
stopped outside listened mens voices
came from the deep interior

  candlelight shone amber through some
bonanza



parchment windows he started around
to listen but a man was coming and he
quickly concealed himself in the shadow
of a storm shed that was built against
the back door

  the man was familiar bill battles

  hatred made him start forward but he
checked himself now wasnt the time

  battles went past so close ryan could
smell the tobacco smoke that clung to his
clothes and disappeared inside the house

  ryan waited he was sure battles had
gone on to the distant lighted room
through the open storm shed door he
could dimly see a kitchen the teeth of
ruddy light glowing through the open
draft of a cookstove

  he walked in he could hear battles
voice and her voice he knew shed come
there but it made him curse anyway she
was so young and pretty-he didnt like
the thought of her coming to battles

  he wolfed some left-over pancakes a
big iron pot of squaw mulligan bubbled
on the stove he dipped some in a tin-
plate ate spearing huge chunks of cari-
bou with his hunting knife

  with the edge off his hunger he paid
attention to the voices

  battles seemed to be in high humor
saying id liked to have seen his ugly
irish face when you took it

  he could hear the whisky-hoarse voice
of shorty and the girl was laughing she
seemed to be slightly hysterical hunger
and fatigue had left her that way

  len battles said youd better have
a little more to eat you wait ill get it
for you

  that was her name len

  ryan put his dipper of stew aside and
stood with his shoulders high his fists
doubled it would be a pleasure to smash
battles teeth down his throat when he
walked throtigh the door then reluctantly
he decided to stay quiet there was no
use of kicking things over now just when
he was on the verge of learning what he
wanted to know

  he hunkered behind the table as bat-
tles walked in the man was so close he
could have thrust a leg beneath the table
and touched him his back was turned
he took a lid off the stove for illumina-
tion firelight struck him strongly turn-
ing his face to yellowish copper bringing
put its hard lines the long jaw the small

mouth

  he filled a dish and without once look-
ing toward ryan went out leaving the
damp wool and tobacco odor of his clothes
behind

  it went against ryans nature to hide
he stood up cursing him stabbing chunks
of meat with his hunting knife carrying
them to his mouth finished he listened

  shorty said something about beadwork
and he knew they were examining the
girdle he stood close to the door but
only stray groups of words reached him

  he could hear from the intervening
room but it was too light and it offered
no place for concealment he considered
going outside lisetcning with an ear to
the parchment window but he gave that
up too

  his roving eyes fell on a four-rung
pole ladder that had been nailed to the
kitchens inner wall it led to a small loft
between the rafters and the roof poles

  he climbed crawled over some bundled
mildewed hides and stopped on one knee
to get dust and cobwebs out of his mouth
and nasal passages

  there wasnt room for a man to stand
upright even on one knee his head was
bent against the ceiling it was so warm
that sweat rolled off him six poles had
been laid side by side down the middle
across the rafters heavy gray building
paper had been tacked on the undersides
of the rafters to form a ceiling but it had
been punctured here and there and shafts
of light from the candle gave a fair illumi-
nation

  he edged forward stopping when the
voices lowered starting against when they
were raised or when someone laughed
it had been a long time since the foot-
poles had supported anyone one of them
settled with a slight thud he remained
very still the voices had stopped dust
rose in a cloud he wanted to sneeze and
cough he set his teeth held his breath
tears streamed from his eyes they were
talking again now

  for the moment lie gave up trying to
get closer he lay on his stomach and
listened

the girl had called someone uncle
mai it was shortys whisky hoarse
voice that answered her he should have
guessed before that they were related


northwest romances

they had the same broad foreheads the
same sharply cut features

  hed want it that way shorty was
saying you cant worry about such
things when you fight a wolfs fight you
have to use a wolfs weapons anyhow
nothing will come of it well register
this as newly mined gold and who is
there to prove that it isnt

  battles laughed saying well were
going to dig it out of the ground isnt
that mining it

  she said you sound as though we had
it already

  were closer than you think there
was a pause battles had looked at his
watch ryan could hear the snap as he
closed the case its been better than an
hour that breed should have been here
ten minutes ago

  she asked where was he

  at the siwash camp drunk again
where do they get the liquor to stay
drunk all the time

  make it out of the spuds old hakteel
raised

  shorty said i could use a few drops
myself

  uncle

  he cried damn it quit ragging me
who are you to be bossing me around
she didnt answer so he said anyhow
im only taking a drop i said i was
cutting down and i am a man cant
just cut himself off like that

  ryan could hear the squeak of a cork
the sound of little movements several
minutes passed finally battles said

  i think i could decipher this myself
if i had the time he was evidently ex-
amining the girdle ryan wanted to creep
a trifle further but he didnt he lay
still you see that len thats the si-
wash figure for nas-gin-ax-gan-three men
and those marks indicate the time of day
thats ga-gan or the sun those indicate
the length of shadows and that the day
of the year ive decided thats how the
old squaw established her direction to the
cache-through sunset on a certain day
of the year

  she said the day the gold was buried 
  i suppose

  what day was it i mean what time
of year

  late july id imagine or august
thats just a guess but their placer muck

wouldnt thaw up in circle until mid-
june and it would take them anyhow
three weeks to sluice it and clean up
then theyd have to paddle all this dis-
tance down the yukon dont worry len
well figure this out something told
ryan that hed laid his hand on the girls
arm sure well have it out of the
ground and be on our way to seattle be-
fore snow flies seattle len im going
to enjoy showing you that town then
san francisco los angeles maylje the
east coast theres no limit what we can
do with that kind of money

  the pieces all fit according to the
most commonly told story the four pros-
pectors had been attacked near the head-
waters of stormwind creek three had
been killed while a fourth escaped
wounded to a siwash village ryan could
put the rest together a squaw had hid-
den the wounded man from his pursuers
and hed died there after giving her the
location of the cache squaw-fashion this
information had been worked in the bead
pattern of the girdle

  and finally dave had got hold of it he
grinned and thought the old philanderer
hed heard many tales dating to daves
younger days telling of his prowess among
the squaws

  he lay listened to them talk of small
things move impatiently walk repeatedly
to the door to watch for the breeds ar-
rival

  there he is now battles said

  two men in moccasins by the sound
someone spoke a low word or two in an
indian tongue they walked through and
battles spoke calling them steve and
hakteel

  ha yes the one called steve cried
out here let me look at it yes that
is it i have seen it hanging on the medi-
cine stick in my mothers wickiup ten
hundred times and she would never let me
touch it i didnt know why this is it
then see hakteel what you think of
bead work ol mama damn good no
there was quiet evidently hakteel had
the girdle and was trying to decipher it

  ked-jin-qua he said over a couple of
times

  battles asked what does he mean
  a hundred the breed answered

  a hundred what

  hakteel muttered no savvy very
bonanza



hard savvy you give drink whisky maybe
hakteel savvy

  battles laughed said i should break
your neck but there was a squeak of
the cork and hakteels cough and in-
halation after the drink

  you see sharp mountain you know
sharp mountain

  which direction from stormwind
  like-so look like so

  ryan could tell nothing from the con-
versation he rose on hands and knees
slid forward little by little there was a
tear in the building paper about four feet
distant finally he reached it bent his
head far down between the rafters and
he could see them below they were
hunched over the table hakteel an old
ragged siwash pointing to some feature
of the beadwork with a fingernail that
looked white as a bit of clam shell on
the end of his filthy black finger steve
a tall lean half breed of thirty with a
deeply scarred right check and little pew-
ter rings in his ears battles on the other
side of the table with shorty trying to see
over his shoulder he couldnt see the
girl

  they kept talking with hakteel ex-
plaining things in the tlingit jargon

  suddenly he noticed that shorty was
looking directly up at him

  he checked the impulse to draw back
he remained as he was not making the
silghtest move it seemed that more than
a minute passed then shorty turned sud-
denly and nibbed his forehead as though
it pained him

  rvan slid back he didnt want to be
cornered there from below he could hear
battles coughing he realized that his
movement had started dust to sifting
through the air

  wliat the hell wheezed battles
steve said you need a drink all of
us need a drink how about it shorty
you need a drink

  ryan stood in a crouch climbed over
the bundles of pelts located the top rung
of the ladder descended to the kitchen

  he glanced around the kitchen seemed
to be empty he moved past the table
with long strides through the storm shed
and took a deep breath of the cold out-
side air

  dont move said the girls voice be-
hind him

iv

he stood stiffly erect by tilting
his head back slightly he was able
to see her moving from shadow at the
rear of the shed night twilight coming
through the slight mist gleamed on the
gun in her hand

  so you got here he said

  he managed to laugh you were the
clever one with all that backtrailing but
i had a balcony seat to it all

  what do you mean

  i was at timberline on the ridge watch-
ing every step you took

  mavbe you were too clever

  now what do you mean by that
he looked at the gun oh i see you
mean your friends will kill me like they
did poor dave carson

  he remembered her sharp reaction to
the charge of murder at baker it had a
similar effect now

  we never killed him

  oh but you did they did

  what proof do you have

  his body showed up drowned in the
river below three pillars drowned with
hobnails on dave would never use hobs
in a canoe

  her lips curled what proof is that
they killed him girl its true as im
standing here they killed him then they
came for me they were after the girdle
they were waiting in the dark at my room
in blind toms hotel look at my face
see the marks on it see where battles
beat me while that man they call shorty
held a gun in my back

  youre lying

  no i am not lying look me in the
eye and say what kind of men you have
joined up with

  her teeth were clenched she was lis-
tening men were talking unfamiliar
voices coming toward the front of the
house others in that outlaw valley were
prolably in on the plot and there was
another sound-a man coming heavily
through the house

  with a tightening of his muscles ryan
realized it was battles

  get back she whispered

  he moved into the shadow but not so
far but what he could see battles in the
door battles hesitated and said

oh its you len i thought i heard

romances

something why the gun

  you surprised me she put it away

  this things got you jumpy theres
nothing to worry about now nobody
would come here not even a fool like
ryan you better go back to the cabin
and get some rest

  all right

  ill see you later he said and turned
away

  she called to him bill will you tell
uncle mai to come right over i want
to talk with him

  ill keep him away from the bottle
if thats-

  send him over

  shed drawn the gun again and ryan
laughed at her youre being foolish
there was nothing to stop me drawing
on you a moment ago

  she stood with it aimed for a few
seconds then with a nervous movement
she stabbed it back in the holster

  all right maybe you want to come
to the cabin with me maybe you want
to accuse him of it face to face

  sure well do it any way you like
and well get the truth of it and what
then 

  she walked beside him without an-
swering he knew that she hadnt decided
herself

the cabin was dark save for a
slight glow that came from a low-
burned fire in the stove

  they went in together she closed the
door he could hear her moving around
blanketing a window then she lighted a
candle from the stove

  it had been twilight when he faced
her before this was his first good look
at her

  she seemed even prettier smaller her
hair escaping the cap fell iii thick coils
over her shoulders candlelight raised a
play of color from the strands it was
dark brown but not black her eyes were
blue unusually dark a midnight shade
excitement had brought a slight flush to
her cheeks her lips were parted she
kept touching her tongue to them biting
her lower lip with her small white teeth
her buckskin skirt was cinched more
tightly it revealed her slim waist accen-
tuated the soft curves of her body

  she said we might as well sit down

he might not even come he hates me
because of the liquor he ought to know
i do it for his own good

  we drinking men are that way ryan
said cheerfully and grinned showing liis
two gold teeth he spoke her name len
is that it

  you were up there eaves-dropping
he looked at the dust-coated front of
his mackinaw and pants im in no con-
dition to deny it

  what did you hear

  i heard that your name was len
len what

  len darrel

it surprised him that shed answered
ive heard of no white girl being at
mucker where did you come from
dont try to find out any more itll
do you no good

  a mans boots thudded the planks out-
side and she got quickly to her feet
uncle mai

  yes

  come in

  he opened the door came in started
to close it behind him then he saw ryan
he blinked a few times hed had too
much to drink hed had too much to
drink every day for months and it had
deadened his reflexes

  close the door she said sharply
ryan knew by the dart of the mans
eyes that he was afraid of the girl

  he said you ryan what the hell
are you- he checked himself ryaa
guessed why he didnt want len to know
theyd ever met

  she said howd you happen to know
who he was

  i guessed after you told about him
chasing you-

  and after all that you thought it
would be natural hed be here in the
cabin with me tell me the truth you
met before she waited for him to an-
swer did you did you meet him be-
fore 

  he seemed to lie baffled he weaved his
head from side to side

  she said you waited in the hotel room
at moyukuk and tortured him

  he kept shaking his head he was afraid
of the girl ryan had seen fear like his
in the eyes of a trapped wolf a fear
mixed with hatred

  she cried how did the old pros-
bonanza



pector die you went to porcupine and
followed him down to the rapids didnt
you you found him camped there you
killed him

  no damn it quit shouting at me i
aint going to take it any longer-

  she reached and grabbed a coiled dog
whip from a peg on the wall he started
back as the lash snaked across the room
and came to a stop with a crack like
a rifle shot

  he tossed both hands up there was
a stool back of his legs it tripped him
he sprawled to the floor hands in front
of his face

  lie to me she was a master with
the lash it cracked above his head so
closely it riffled his hair it terrified him
without striking him

  he whimpered ill tell you the truth
yes we waited for him in the hotel
room battles and me it wasnt my doing
thought it was battles i couldnt-
how about the prospector

  he crawled off shaking his head got
half way to his feet back braced against
the log wall he twisted aside as the lash
came once more powdering a bit of mud
chinking near his cheek

  we followed him down to the rapids
he was camped there battles said wed
talk to him them was his words i didnt
know what he had on his mind i didnt
know he intended to scorch it out of him
you mean you tortured him

  he was going to battles he was going
to make him tell where the girdle was
he can make it easy or tough on himself
those were battles words listen len i
tried to get him not to i said it wasnt
like a white man to treat another white man
like that beaates threatened to serve me
the same way so i sneaked around and
cut him loose but it was a mistake carson
made a run for it and battles hit him with
a pikepole we tried to bring him to but it
wasnt any use so we put him in his canoe
and turned him loose in the rapids we
didnt think hed be found anyhow we
didnt think theyd guess but what he got
swamped trying the shoot the rapids
she looked at her uncle as though she
hated him with her lips drawn to a tight
line she said you bushwhacker

  it wasnt my fault the experience
had left him so weak and shaky he could
barely stand i got to have a drink

  she turned her back and he found
the whisky bottle took a huge drink and
stood shuddering like a man getting chill
out of his body he kept looking at her
his werent the eyes of a whipped dog
they were the eyes of a whipped wolf
filled with craftiness and hatred

  he whispered dont let battles know
i told you hed kill me len hed-

  i wont tell him

  she hung the dog whip back on its
peg she drew her revolver a  colt
put it back again she opened a drawer
got out a box of fifty cartridges dropped
them in her jacket pocket

  her uncle kept looking back and forth
between her and ryan what are you
going to do

  i dont know she motioned indica-
ing the other room of the cabin-a bed-
room evidently her own stay in there
he went in and closed the door rvan
could hear the creak of a bunk as he lay
down

  she said all right to ryan and
he followed her outside

she had stopped him with a press of
her shoulder and he stood looking
down at her it gave him a strange almost
giddy feeling to have her so close her
shoulder under the buckskin seemed to he
very frail and soft he could feel the small
movement of her body

  she said looking up at him the girdle
is mine you know

  tell me about it

  my father bought it from that half-
breed

  from steve

  yes his mother made it it was a
guide to lead him to the stormwind cache
but probably you knew all that

  im finding things out how did she
know about the cache

  there was one survivor his name was
regan or rogan he crawled there to
chatna village and she hid him he re-
mained there for several years a cripple
sick most of the time finally he died
but he told how to find tlie cache and
she wove it into the girdle intending to
give the secret to their son

  she had a son by rogan

  that half breed is their son steve
well what happened what stopped
him from getting it
	northwest romances

  he was a troublemaker they drove
him away from the village when he was
only twelve or thirteen he wandered the
gold camps he was in jail for robbery
at sitka and he killed another halfbreed
at nome he didnt know about the
treasure until after his mother died and
old hakteel told him at that time he
was at pavel mission where my father was
a fur trader he owed my father better
than seven hundred dollars one day
battles and my uncle came around and
talked my father into buying a two-thirds
interest on the girdle for that seven
hundred and a thousand besides

  that was last autumn my dad was
sick hed been sick off and on for years
he signed his interest in the girdle over
to me before he died i didnt know which
way to turn i knew i couldnt run down
the cache by myself so my uncle and
battles came with me on shares i guess
you know the rest when we reached
chatna village the girdle was gone hed
taken it your partner

  theres one thing youve forgotten
she never did give it to her son maybe
she did give it to dave

  you have no proof of that she made
it for her-

  girl he took her by the shoulders
and lifted her toes off the ground while
turning her so she faced him theres
no point in us arguing about it the point
is that neither of us has the girdle its
in the hands of a killer as you know
lets face the real fact according to
the law of the north it belongs to nobody
and everybody the treasure belongs to
the one who finds it

  she didnt try to escape from his grasp
she seemed to be glad he was there she
was tired of fighting the lone fight she
needed someone to lean against ryan
liked to think that he liked the press of
her young body against him he liked the
slight siding movements of her smooth
skin under the buckskin blouse as she
breathed

  finally with firm shove of her hands
she pushed away we cant delay i dont
know what my uncle will do if we get the
thing well have to get it now

  sure girl

  he drew his  broke it checked on
the loads snapped it shut again two

hundred yards away distorted by the night
mist he could see the glowing parchment
windows of the long log house

  ill go down and get it girl

  no you wouldnt have a chance dun-
hill and williams are probably there both
of them are dangerous dunhill killed a
man once over at shaktolik

  he was reluctant unconvinced how
do you intend to get it 

  she smiled a trifle and said i got it
from you after battles failed

  they walked together and stopped at
the rear of the house a mutter of voices
came from inside they could hear battles
and the loud obscene bellowing laugh of
steve

  she said nulato bob is there too

  whos he

  a quarterbreed a boat builder she
smiled up at him and whispered he built
that canoe you couldnt catch then
moving inside the storm shed youll wait
there 

  for how long theres less than an
hour of darkness left

  if im that long go back to the house
keep your eye on uncle see to it he stays
there

  her uncle had a gun ryan wondered
what hed do if the man decided to use it
he didnt want to kill him-not her uncle

  he rolled a cigarette of damp paper and
tobacco felt by habit for his match can
the matches were crumbly and he didnt
dare light one anyway he dry smoked
and waited

v

the night was very quiet male-
mutes kept moving around inside the
wire pens but they were used to his scent
now and they didnt create a commotion
from a great distance across the benches
someone was playing a concertina

  the tune momentarily reminded him of
nels jonsruds song and he sang the
words under his breath

  yah yah vat skal ve ha

  olga on a buggyride yah yah yah

  len there was a girl for a buggyride

  he kept hearing their voices from in-
side len only had a few words to say
bonanza	

uually it was battles or the breed it
was especially easy to hear the breed
sometimes whole sentences came through

  there was a slight sound from the
night behind him and ryan spun whip-
ping the gun out with a reflex movement
of his hand

  he could see no one it had been a
packrat a night bird or just his over-taut
nerves he was too much on edge hed
traveled too long without sleep

  he put the gun away then he heard it
again this time he had no doubt it had
been a man the light whisper of moccasins
across the ground

  he circled the building he had a
glimpse of someone just disappearing
around the front corner it was her uncle

  he ran covering the distance with long
silent strides the man wasnt there hed
already gone through the front door

  he felt slightly sick he wondered what
the man had on his mind he hated and
feared his niece but with battles there
hed fear her no longer

  he was undecided he stood by the
door listened there was light around it
no one in that front room he pulled the
babiche latch string lifted the door to
keep it from scraping opened it three or
four inches

  now he could hear them shorty battles
and the girl their voices were upraised
the breed shouted something and the
girl cried stand back

  there was a scramble a crash of over-
turning furniture and the light went out

  ryan ran through the front room
found a second door went through it

  the struggle was all around him a
shot laced the blackness with flaming
powder the girl screamed he knew it
was she who had fired that someone was
trying to hold her

  the gun crashed again again

  len he cried len

  a gun exploded in his face it left him
deaf hed lost his sense of direction he
resisted the impulse to fire he kept going
trod over someone who was just getting
to his feet

  he caught the scent of sweat and
indian-tanned buckskin the man grappled
with him and ryan smashed him down

  he kept going saying len where
are you len

  she hadnt answered him she was no
longer there shed had a gun shed shot
her way out shed be looking for him at
the rear door he was a fool he should
have stayed there like hed agreed

  men were in front of him he heard the
breed shout its him its the irishman

  he charged swinging the gun hurling
men from his way he found the door he
knew his way now there was an inter-
vening room then the kitchen

  men were on his heels he flung the
kitchen door shut grabbled the table
hurled it against the door it stopped them
for a couple of seconds the stove was
there at his right he overturned it it
smashed down across the table spilling
fire it put them in retreat

  outside he stopped len

  she didnt answer him he skirted the
storm shed shouting len len where
are you

  a short heavy set man was on the run
around the house he drew up bellowed
there he is and lifting the carbine
rifle in his hands fired

  ryan had pivoted dived to one side he
felt the wind-whip of lead past his
shoulder his  answered in the same
fraction of time the bullet hit it smashed
the heavyset man backward he dropped
his rifle he reeled for three steps with
both arms wrapped around his middle
then he caught himself and took a step
forward over crumpling knees and fell
face forward to the ground

  ryan saw it in a glance as he returned
gunfire from another direction he kept
firing moving along in the shadow of the
pole eave his gun clicked empty

he ran across open ground with
bullets from two directions churning
the dirt back of his heels reached the
placer trench dived face foremost into
its protection

  he reloaded the gun untangled himself
from brush moved in a direction that
would bring him closer to the dog pens

  his rifle was back there he wanted to
get it

  men were coming around in two di-
rections trying to pin him down but the
 reached out well and none of them
risked suicide by getting close

  the house was in flames now light
	northwest

from the fire and light from approaching
sunrise made them still more wary

  no bullet had been close for five minutes
now ryan risked showing himself he
walked to the rear of the dog sheds found
his bedroll and rifle

  he cupped his hands and called len
knowing hed get no answer

  hed seen nothing of her heard nothing
of her since those shots in the house

  flames was rolling both ways through
the house now and a thought occurred to
him that made him sick she wasnt in
there shed gotten out he kept telling
himself that shed gotten out

  the fight had left him groggy he didnt
know which way to turn it was quite light
now the rising sun made a rusty-yellow
flare on the horizon he walked across
to her cabin

  no one was there his eyes roved the
town everything seemed to be peaceful
smoke rose from a couple of cabin
chimneys

  he started toward the nearest house he
should have expected to be met with
gunfire he didnt the night just passed
seemed like a bad dream

  he could see a man crouched over
watching his approach through an open
window when he reached the door the
man had moved back and picked up a
gun

  put it down ryan said i have no
fight with you

  he walked in and sat down the mans
squaw was frying pancakes ryan helped
himself to a plateful and started to eat

  the man a short dirty middle-aged
fellow laughed and put the rifle down
you sure got your guts

  he asked around a mouth filled with
pancakes whered he go battles

  how in hell would i know i dont
keep track of battles

  wheres the girl

  i dont keep track of her neither he
looked over at his ugly siwash squaw
not that id mind the job

  you might as well tell me

  or what he picked up the gun
again you got some ideas of getting
rough 

  i seen enough rough stuff for one day
  you in on all that shooting

  i was sort of on the edge of it

romances

  you the one that killed dunhill

  i dont know how many were killed
he started to rise was there a body in-
side the house

  just shortys he laughed shot in
the back so you see what way he was
headed

  ryan was unable to get more infor-
mation from him he decided that battles
had left the camp hed left during the
fight and taken the girl with him

  the girl had mentioned nulato bob
the boat builder he walked to the sagging
riverhouse whee a single skin oomiyak
was tied he could remember looking down
from the heights and seeing a canoe there
the evening before

  a broad very bow legged siwash half-
breed was inside the cavelike living quart-
ers peering at him

  wheres battles

  the man didnt answer

  ryan went inside followed him as he
backed across the room he shouted
wheres battles

  no sawy

  you savvy all right wheres battles
and the girl 

  the breed shook his head violently and
kept repeating no savvy he backed up
until a table stopped him he tried to get
around it ryans right hand shot out
grabbing him by his grease-blackened buck-
skin shirt

  ryan jerked him back and forth until
his hat flew off and his long hair strung
across his face ihs mouth was open and
spittle ran from the comers

  talk you savvy all right where are
they talk talk

  sure me sawy now me sawy good
  thev took the canoe 

  yes

  whered they go

  downriver i dont know they dont
tell me they-

  who was with them battles the girl
and who else

  just halfbreed just steve just three
ryan bent his spine over the table un-
til he gasped and then he bent it a little
more you know what ill do if youre
lying ill come back here and break you
in half

  no i talk true he gasped i talk
true as hell

he had no choice but to take the
oomiyak

  the oomiyak was made of skin stretched
over a birch frame made to carry as many
as five men it was buoyant but cumber-
some

  the current took him swiftly he turned
a bend and left the town behind the
placer diggings played out he was in a
wilderness of scabby hills and jackpine

  a large stream flowed in from the
west it doubled the rivers volume but its
width narrowed it ran deep and swift
between walls of rusty black basalt

  this was the ophir river ever since
coming to the country hed heard white
water men talk about the ophir naming
its course from mucker hill to yukon
flats the swiftest fifty miles in the north
certain names came back to him-the
tom hall chutes big six rapids and
hells skidway lots of canoe men bragged
that theyd shot the hells skidway but it
was something a man did only once to
prove himself like a cree lad winning his
eagle feather

  the sun rose hot on his back an hour
passed and the current had carried him
far downstream

  the valley narrowed ahead of him the
stream was pinched down to a third of its
former width he kept the oomiyak in
midstream and took the plunge without in-
cident below were choppy rapids with the
stream cut into many channels

  he rode between sheer-sided islands of
stone boat-shaped islands with gnarled
little pine trees growing on their tops the
channel was so narrow he could have
reached his canoe paddle and touched the
stone on either side

  there was a pocket among the hills with
gulches fanning out in all directions the
bottoms were filled with cottonwoods a
cow moose waded and stopped to look at
him

  he took a wide sweep of the river
noticed a canoe-float toward the right
bank a tiny cabin on the rock bank
beyond

  he kept going with the current pulling
his oomiyak faster and faster he spotted
a portage trail along the basaltic bluffs to
his right too late he realized that hed

stumbled into the headwaters of hells
skidway

  the river was quiet its current made
glassy swells dipped and swelled again
it slid at a half-mile-a-minute rate along
the smooth-worn bottom ahead through
rising mist he could hear the deep boom
of water tom to froth by crags and water-
fall

  he felt a slight lurch as the boat
speeded it was still smooth looking at
the water he had the impression of stand-
ing still it was only on glancing at the
canyon walls that he realized how swiftly
the current was carrying him

  spray met him with a sudden wave the
boat lurched and creaked for blind
seconds it seemed that the craft had
crumpled under the impact of crosscur-
rents then through spray he saw the
prow still at the correct angle sinking
dipping water rising dipping again

  he battled to keep it lined with the cur-
rent a crag split the channel ahead to
his left lay the broader half of the river
apparently without obstruction to his
right it was funnelled down through a
narrow chute

  he fought to swing away from the
chute for a few seconds he seemed to be
winning but a swerve of the current seized
the craft and all his paddling had been
futile

  he didnt struggle further he sat back
knowing the river would do what it
wanted with him its power was too vast

  for a quarter-minute-a quarter-mile-
vertical rock walls closed the channel in
he burst in the clear he saw then that
the channel hed fought to attain was cut to
churning froth by a thousand crags that
rose from the bottom they would have
swamped the oomiyak cut it to ribbons
but luck in spite of all his efforts had
guided him the way of safety

  there was still a long stretch of rapids
ahead but he was able to maneuver them
and he saw on shore the lower terminus of
the portage trail

  he looked for battles and the girl no
sign of them he wondered if they too
had shot the rapids if not if theyd taken
the portage hed been able to obliterate
the hours head start they had from
mucker

  he crossed choppy water cleared a

gravelly point shot more rapids they
seemed like nothing after hells skidway

  a bullet tore splinters from the front
gunwale and whipped past his shoulder
the crack and echo of a high power rifle
smacked down close atop it

  he instinctively went to the bottom of
the oomiyak the craft had shipped six
inches of water and his rifle was some-
where under the surface he groped
found it poured water from the barrel

  they were ahead of him less that three
hundred yards two men a canoe it made
him go gutless and sick for a second he
feared she had died in the fire that the
men back in mucker had lied to him
then he saw her seated in the bottom
lying back evidently with elbows bound
to the canoes center seat

  a second bullet shot up a spurt of water
a couple yards to his right

battles was in the prow firing at
him the tall breed was in the stem
maneuvering the canoe

  he dropped the gun he cursed them
for hiding behind a woman

  he had no chance in an open chase
theyd kill him without his daring to
fire a shot back his only chance was to
get out of range and follow them until
luck gave him an opening

  he swung the oomiyak toward shore
the third bullet skipped water and tore a
hole through both sides at the waterline
battles was firing as fast as he could
lever the rifle the river geysered through
from a dozen places ryan could feel the
craft lose buoyancy crouched in the bot-
tom water rolled midway of his thighs
the craft listed slowly he tried desper-
ately to compensate with his own weight
but it kept going water gurgling over the
side and capsized

  he was over his head in the stream he
was being carried with the gray white river
all around him he lost all sense of di-
rection of up and down then without
knowing how it happened he was on his
feet balanced against the current wading
waist-deep over the rock-slippery bottom
toward shore

  he rested and coughed water from his
lungs there was no longer any sign of the
canoe

  he felt for his gun the holster was
bonanza



empty he was unarmed except for the
hunting knife at his belt

  he walked for hours following the
shore where he could leaving it when the
river passed through canyon walls return-
ing watching for the canoe the sun grew
hot and dried his clothes it sank and a
cold wind sprang up the hills played out
the river meandered off into the yukon
flats

 this was barren country muskeg
country cottonwood and brush country he
climbed a tree saw the river tracings for
miles until it bent westward to join the
mighty yukon but no canoe

  in half a mile he was startled by a
voice from willows near the waters edge
it was steve the halfbreed

  ryan you come good injun hurt
bad

  he stopped drew his hunting knife the
thought of ambush was in his mind but
he dismissed it the breed was no more
than fifty steps away short enough range
for any ambush

  what are you doing here 

  hurt-bad bullet you sawy
  wheres battles and the girl

  steve cursed until his voice played out
naming battles every vile word in english
and the coastal jargons he was still cur-
sing when ryan worked through the tangle
of brush and found him

  he was lying on his back his shirt was
open to the waist a bloody bandage was
twisted around his chest

  who got you battles

  stray bullet cabin i dont know he
shoot shorty by mistake maybe me too
i think-just scratch you sawy he
had to lie still to get the strength to go on
so i come with them but all the time in
canoe it bleed i ask for rest no you carry
the long portage i ask for sleep in bottom
of canoe no you swing the paddle pretty
soon i think i die he kick me overboard

long yellowish teeth in a grin but i
die hard you sawy

  ryan took time to look at the wound
the bullet had gone through breaking
some ribs perhaps it had nicked a lung

  cough any blood

  leetle

  he bandaged it using dry moss on the
wound openings then he stood and said
ill come back

  steve struggled to sit up never he
keel you he-

  i die hard too ill come back

  he ran now forgetting the fatigue
that had steadily deadened his muscles he
ran for a mile walked a hundred yards
ran again a high-water creek lay in front
of him he waded it moccasins deep in
the mucky bottom water to his armpits
he kept going across tundra and muskeg
through brush and cottonwood

  he cut across a wide bend of the
river and was reapproaching its cutbank
shore when a girls scream shattered the
evening quiet

  len he heard a muttered guttural
word from battles a thud and crash like
a sudden brief struggle

    hed gone to one knee in the cover
of scab brush now he edged on found
better concealment in brush saplings

  he wasnt certain which direction the
sounds had came from the river was only
thirty or forty steps away and the dis-
tance had been greater tharr that he
moved swiftly skirting the brush for a
hundred yards ahead of him lay a high-
water channel as yet not reached by spring
flood filled with a low growth of saplings
and brush

  he glimpsed a flash of scarlet-the
canoe there was movement a muffled
gasping cry of the girl

  a gun exploded as he took his first
step down the bank

  it came from point blank range the
bullet hit him it spun him off his feet
he felt no pain he seemed to be floating
shock left a high ringing sound in his
ears

  the bullet had turned him half way
around he fell head first down the slope
slid with his left arm outflung was stopped
by a dense tangle of rose thorns

  the thorns hid him momentarily and
saved his life

  battles fired blind through the brush
the slug tore damp earth by ryans head

  acting on instinct he rolled to his feet
dived headlong through the bushes and
battles was right below

  battles tried to lever a third cartridge
into his rifle to bring the muzzle around
ryan thrust the barrel high the hunting
knife was in his right hand he swung
it in a terrific horizontal arc

  battles staggering back escaped the
knife its point grabbing his mackinaw
twisted over and flew from ryans hand

  ryan had recovered somewhat from
shock he knew better than bend over for
the knife he continued his charge trying
to keep the big man off balance

  battles got a foothold and pivoted with
a swing of his body he pulled the rifle
free he stood at his full height feet set
wide the gun gripped in both hands and
drove its steel-shod butt down toward
ryans skull

  it would have crushed his skull like a
dry mushroom he saw ryan drop and
thought that had happened he laughed
with a wild shout and cried so you
caught me-for this

  with the word this he drove the gun
butt again but ryan had taken the first
blow glancing off his neck and shoulder
and as the second came he grappled with
arms around battles thick thighs

  the second blow missed he carried
battles staggering backward he got his
footing he stood lifting the big man in
his arms battles tried to use the gun and
failed he let it fall and swung his fists
ryan carried him running and fell with
him flinging him head foremost to the
sharp rocks at the edge of the river

  battles picked himself up the saw edge
of a rock had sliced his right ear until it
hung by a ribbon down the side of his
neck

  the fall had left battles groggy he
felt for his ear knew what had happened
it infuriated him he charged and was
met by a left and right he went down like
one hit by a sledge

  he got up he took another left and
right his head rolled his loose jaw
sagged his eyes stared without seeing he
went down again and again he ended on
his face in knee-deep water

  ryan watched the milky river roll over
him for a few seconds and started forward
to pull him out but the big man had a
bonanza



brutes endurance he got to his feet
with a dripping rectangular chunk of
rock in his hands he tried to lift it
drive it down on ryans skull but his
feet slipped from under him the rode
tangled itself inside the front of his
sliirt he got up its weight carried him
off balance he was waist deep he fell
got up the stone was no longer there
but the river current and its slick rock and
mud baffled him he floundered deep lash-
ing the water to a froth as the undertow
grabbed him

  he was gone and the river was very
quiet a big stream a deep stream flow-
ing between muskeg banks to yukon to
norton soimd to the bering sea

  ryan noticed that the left arm of his
mackinaw was heavy from blood he
climbed the bank and saw len fighting
herself free from some babiche thongs that
hdd her wrists to a cottonwood sapling
a strip of cloth had been wound tightly
around her mouth as a gag

  he found his knife on the ground cut
her free

  youre wounded were the first words
she said take off your mackinaw

  he didnt seem to hear he took her
by the arms just below her shoulders
helped her to stand

  len i never thought id see you
again

  take off your mackinaw she got free
of him grabbed the front of his mackinaw
pulled it open now lie down before you
bleed to death

  he watched her cut the sleeve of his
shirt off revealing the bullet wound and
work swiftly staunching the flow of blood

  it missed the vein by half an inch
you were lucky

  thats the luck of the ryans never
good judgement but just plain luck that
always carried the ryans through

  you werent lucky about one thing
  whats that girl

  she tilted her head at the river he
had the girdle

  hed almost forgotten about the girdle
im shedding no tears girl i was rich
once and i want no part of it again it
was by the merest good fortune tliat i
lived dirough it champagne how my
stomach grows ill at first thought of the
stuff

religion and the
eskimo

     when missionaries first came to the arc-
   tic the eskimos found it very difficult to
   understand their religion there were many
   things that pleased the natives it removed
   a number of taboos and made it possible
   for them to eat anything they liked at any
   time but the new religion permitted them
   to haw only one wife-and that was very
   inconvenient at times for the missionaries
   frozvned upon the old custom of borrowing
   a friends wife-to take on a journey for
   example or to make up ones winter ward-
   robe this ivorked a hardship on the men
   for some eskimo women are better at mak-
   ing sealskin boots and caribou-skin attigis
   than others in the old days you could if
   you were willing to relinquish your pretty
   young wife for a couple of weeks get a
   real bargain in a seamstress

    nowadays say the eskimo men it is
  very difficult when you want to make a trip
  of perhaps a hundred miles by dogteam
  and your wife is expecting a baby she
  cant make the trip of course yet he needs
  a woman to mend his skin clothing do the
  cooking dry his boots and socks at night
  and be a companion to him on the journey
  before the missionaries came he could have
  borrowed a frieids wife who was in good
  condition for traveling she might even
  visit a sister or a brother at the village he
  was headed for

    there was another phase of the white
  mans religion that the eskimos found dif-
  ficult to understand the do unto others
  precept the natives tried to practice this
  philosophy when one of them had two
  wives and it tvas quite obvious that the
  missionary didnt have any he would say
  here you have no wife i have two take
  one the missionary would be very grate-
  ful and would explain that jesus would
  not approve

    why the eskimo would ask surely
  if i had two pairs of boots and you didnt
  have any it would be all right for me to
  give you a pair why isnt it all right for
  me to give you one of my wivesf
