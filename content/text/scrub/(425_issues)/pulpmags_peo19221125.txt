       diiuje

a story of adventure in the dutch east indies red saunders fight-
ing skipper was known all over the islands he hit sumatra-and

met up with beauchamp-

chapter i

leaving the office of the third
greatest merchant of palembang
kenneth beauclerc saunders
stood for a moment just outside the
door he was mad clear through and
showed it as much as he ever showed
anger by assuming a smile of ultra-
sunniness toward all the world

  saunders stood six feet and an inch
above the ground built on correspond-
ing lines he possessed a vital radiating
personality which did not stop short at
sheer manly beaut of face and figure
his thick wavy hair was to put it
mildly auburn as red saunders he

was known from comorin to calcutta
and from canton to the cape while a
hundred tiny island ports had offered
snug anchorage at times to his trim
fast schooner the block pearl

  it is not to be thought for one mo-
ment that the red-headed sailor-trader
had honored the third greatest merchant
in palembang with a first original call
saunders dealt at all times with the
greatest in everything that he now
found it necessary to treat with lesser
fry was due to causes which at last led
to the results with which this tale is
concerned he had already visited that
morning the two first merchants in the


peoples story magazine

town his reception at the office of the
man of third importance had been so
entirely similar to that experienced
twice before waithin half an hour that
for once in his active life he was
brought to a temporary halt i here
was no freight for him no business
calling for the employment of a swift
stanch schooner

  mynheer there is nothing trade
is not good he was told in just so
many words at three offices at -the
first not descending to chaffer he had
simply left without comment at the
second slightly irritated by the repeti-
tion of rhe unsatisfactory answer to his
inquiry he had asked for a better
reason he knew that the ports of
sumatra were never busier he had
just returned from colombo to which
port he had freighted a full hold of
dyewoods and gutta-percha with the
promise of more cargoes to come and
on the sixty-mile passage of the river
from tihe sea to the port of palembang
the stream w-as dotted with inward and
outward craft the outward-bounders
deeper of loadline than the incoming
ships yet he was hearing nothing but
luguibrious tales of poor trade

  trade is very good he asserted
with a dawning smile to the second
merchant my schooner is fast wrell
found and safe i want a cargo any-
thing to anywhere

  i am sorry mynheer if one has
no goods one cannot give out cargo

  saunders peeped into the warehouse
as he left this second distressed mer-
chants office it was choked with
bags of sago bundles of rattans copra
gum and spices native carts filled
the streets with loads of rubber coffee
and rice either going to fill to further
overflowing the warehouses or to gorge
the holds of waiting vessels in the river
but for the black pearl nothing

  at the third office he had listened to
the tale of woe again but had made no

comment inside his smile grew more
sunny however and when he tcod out-
side the building it broke into a veri-
table summer glow  sure sign of rising
anger

  lu his lengthy career of free-lance
trading to all the port in the eastern
and southern seas he had at times
stepped on the corns of authority petty
and august as witness the tilt with the
commissioner of rhe andamaris the de-
fiance and defeat of rhe sultan of zan-
zibar the utter discomfiture of a high
and mighty official in mombasa but
never had he expected to be compelled
to take up arms even figuratively
against the stolid merchants of dutch
sumatra now he suspected that some
unseen influence was working to drive
him away from a profitable port and
he was not the man to be driven

  with his bronzed face glowing and
only the suspicion of a glint in his
kindly gray eyes he turned back swung
down past the customhouse and en-
tered the office of the british consul

  billy runacres he said with exag-
gerated gravity you just loosen up
and explain to me why sumatra lias
suddenly ceased shipping cargoes out

  the consul young ambitious but not
so overwhelmed by his sense of im-
portance as to have lost his human at-
tributes grinned cheerfully up into the
strong face of his friend

  did you ever hear that story of the
monocled tenderfoot in the western
mining camp red he replied with
apparent irrelevancy lets see it goes
something like this-

  yes i know interrupted saunders
patiently they chucked him out of
the dance hall and lie came back once
twice thrice then they pitched him
out on his ear without much clothes
left and the rim of his monode without
a glass stuck fast in his teeth gradu-
ally dawned on him that they perhaps
didnt want his company didnt it

  correct well
the redheads

   see smiled the big saiiur genially
so you think i am in bad odor hey
then why

  how in creation do i know  de-
manded runacres a little sharply
im a kid compared with you but ive
heard from fellows around here tliat
you had a habit at one time of sailing
very dose to the legal wind without
getting taken aback for the slieer sport
of worrying these eastern officials
how do i know what youve teen up
to lately saunders you may have
kidnaped some fat old dutchman and
made him shiver himself to a damp
shadow bv continually sharpening a
butcher knife in front of him for all i
know youd do that if any of these
obese traders liad ever cheated a pal of
yours out of a guilder im certain

  saunders laughed softly a reminis-
cent look in his twinkling eyes and as-
sured runacres that he had been up to
no such tricks during the past year at
least

  ive too much at stake now billy
he said and ive enough at stake too
to make me unwilling to pull out of
any port where i know my slate is
clean i want a cargo i cant get one
if you cant do anything ill have to
make a turnover in some other way
legitimate of course

  ill see what can be done the con-
sul said with a grin dont happen to
recall a dutch dhap named zimmerman
in zanzibar do you

  dutch zim i knew there was a
beach-combing rascal -by that name
down there during the bombardment
replied saunders musingly he tried
to recall the man but could only see
him hazily as a bit of flotsam of the
seven seas cast up on the zanzibar
beach during stirring times down there
a regular drifter as i remember
what can he have to do with me 

  i dont know but i do know that
he was here a week before you came
back from ceylon asking about your

schooner and that immediately after
his visit all my dutch merchant club
fellows seemed to suddenly cool toward
me as you are about the only itiner-
ant britisher trading here at present
and i happen to be consul under your
flag there may be something in it
come in after lunch say about three
oclock

  saunders spent the waiting time in
making some necessary purchases of
stores for the schooner the town was
full of seamen of all nationalities the
streets had all the appearance of set
scenes in some gorgeous extravaganza
of the stage among such a crowd any
ordinary man might well pass un-
noticed but saunders boasted eyes
which gave him the fullest service and
when he thought he saw over the heads
of the intervening throng the bulky
form of dan mallet his mates he knew
he was not mistaken but to reach him
was far more difficult than simply to
see him as a brief attempt to cross the
street convinced him before he liad
reached the middle of the jostling
crowd mallet was gone

  thats your one-voyage mate for
you red grinned unpleasantly lord
send old tod carter out of hospital
soon

  tod carter had been left ashore the
previous voyage in order that sundry
hurts sustained in asserting his skip-
per prestige against a gang of alco-
holic traducers might be healed for
want of better dan mallet had been
shipped for the time being and saun-
ders had just seen a specimen of his
sense of duty as soon as the skippers
broad back was turned the mate who
should have found plenty for himself
and the crew to do until five oclock
must be off on a premature shore jaunt

  well have a little chat presently
mister mallet saunders muttered to
himself as lie turned in at the consuls
office to hear the result of billy run-
acres quest


people s story magazine

  hullo red old man was billys
forced greeting i cant do a thing
for you sorry you are ab-so-lute-ly
defunct dead and snuffed out so far
as palenibang trade is concerned
dont i know it growled the skip-
per i wanted you to find out why
there must be a reason

  there is naturally i have not
found it though all the reply i can
get is simply that there is no trade
going out suitable for your capacity and
style of craft

  but thats rot do these stodgy
fools of half-baked dutchmen think
they can brush me aside with any such
smug lie as that by thunder run-
acres ill-

  you wont do anything so mad old
chap smiled the consul knowing per-
fectly well to what lengths the skipper
might easily go in anger you have
others to think of besides yourself old
hot-head take a couple of days off
and try then take jess out and show
her around a bit mrs runacres would
be very glad to have you pay us a visit
no need to speak about my own feel-
ings is there

   saunders regained his cheery poise
gripping runacres by the hand he
smiled

  thank you billy youre the same
good old scout as ever ill take a
cooler and think it all over again and
ill tell jess about your invitation
shell want to take it up j can promise
you so long

  on the way down to the schooner
saunders felt himself falling back into
the dark mood of the morning and his
mood was not lightened when he
stepped into his boat and saw mallet
at the schooners rail gazing shoreward
as if he had never been out of the -hip
with his characteristic directness the
skipper lost no time in stepping on
board

  mallet youre fired he said
crisply

  fired capnreturned the mate
uneasily for what

  for the safety of your skin and the
good of the ship

  without a second look at mallet the
skipper entered the cabin and went to
his stateroom the mate stood staring
after him in an attitude of ludicrous
bewilderment his mouth open his
knees bent and his long apelike arms
curved from his sides

  saunders had forgotten all about him
for the moment he flung his hat down
on the settee ran his fingers through
his wavy red hair and glanced about
the snug little chamber his eye lighted
on a note pinned in feminine fashion
to the curtain of his bunk

   dear hubbles and i have gone- to visit
in town we wont return this evening but
if you want us or me you can find us at
the netherland hotel sorry to be away
when you come on board bat the truth is
that mallet has made himself very obnoxiou-
to both of us while you were away i hope
youll get rid of him tod carter was down
here for a little while looking splendid and
said he will be ready to rejoin whenever you
want him your own jess oh well then
with love redhead-heap of it

  amusement affection and anger
struggled for expression in the skip-
pers face with affection and amuse-
ment getting the decision over the third
in the three-cornered duel of emotions
he tould afford to ignore mallet since
he was aibout to quit anyhow but
mallet spoiled a perfectly good chance
of immunity for himself by suddenly
appearing red-faced blazing of eye
truculent of bearing

  hey capn whats your notion in
firing me like a fomast nigger he
demanded saunders faced him slowly
regarding him as he might regard a
tame buffalo which had blundered into
his parlor dan mallet was no insigni-
ficant specimen of a man either he
was an inch shorter than saunders hut
his shoulders were built on lines calling
for seven feet in height and the great
the redheads



fists at the end of his powerful arms
hung almost to his knees his face
was cast in a mold from which iron
masks might have been made rugged
bony square-chinned high of cheek-
bone and now in anger great black
bushes of eyebrows were drawn down
level until they appeared as eaves over-
shadowing the sunken caverns of his
eyes

  go on deck mallet he said with a
clear sunny smile

  not me blustered dan im a
man aint i

  youre shaped like a human being
res what of it i said go on deck

  perhaps the absence of threat caused
mallet to undervalue saunders as a
fighting force it may be that the
gentle smile fooled him whatever the
cause or reason dan mallet made a
bad false play when he stepped boldly
inside the cabin and shook a great fist
under the skippers aquiline nose

  i look like a man and by cripes i
am a man he roared if youre man
enough to-

  in after days dan mallet could never
clearly recall what happened just prior
to his finding himself lying on the deck
beside the gangway he could feel no
such hurts as a smashed nose loosened
teeth or even a plum-bruised eye but
he found on trying to lift himself on
his elbow to look around that his right
arm that reliable old right arm was
broken at the wrist and gradually
he was conscious of a heavy lump
growing under the angle of his jaw
then next thing the skippers voice
sounded close by he looked up and
met the calm gaze of saunders who
stood regarding him curiously mani-
curing his nails with a pocket-knife

	the skipper sauntered aft again his
unruffled hair gleaming in the sunlight
of late afternoon his smile vieing with
the daylight in soft brilliance he met
the steward coming out of the cabin
with mallets belongings

  here betel bob he said handing
the grinning fijian a purse you see
mister mallet snug in hospital and pay
the sawbones for a complete repair
private room if there is one you
neednt tell mallet his bill is paid and
you neednt tell the sawbones whos
paying it understand and if rhe sick
fellow cuts up any didoes on the way
just kick him on the bump under his
jaw thatll last him until you get him
to moorings

chapter ii

  the dilemma which had suddenly in-
volved him occupied the skipper for
some hours after dan mallet was taken
ashore he sat in his cabin at a lit-
tered desk trying to thrash out a plan
to follow something to employ his
vessel and bring ever-needed grist to
the financial mill from where he sat
he faced a heavy solid silver photo
frame in which was a picture

  it was the likeness of a girl of some
twenty years or so a merrily smiling
fluffy haired dimpled girl with the
mysterious charm of adolescence and the
mature fascination of a grown woman
untouched by the world yet fully aware
of the good and evil of it this was
jess and if ever his mind dwelt too
long upon some proposition calling for
the old-time close-hauled sailing one
glance at jess pictured face sufficed
him to swing his mental bark broad off
the wind and ware shoals

  he called the steward when he heard
him return and ate a thick sandwich
of bread and buffalo beef then chang-
ing his clothes he went ashore to try
to find relaxation before going up to 
meet the girls

  out of the eddying swrarms of the
wharves which gave the lie again and
again to those merchants who had
pleaded no trade for him saunders
passed through a section of the towm
where the dutch resident the foreign


peoples story magazine

traveling agent and tihe transient mar-
iner seemed to forgather and all
seemed to be bound in the same direc-
tion past club and hotel giving but a
glance in at the theater doors the white-
clad stream of europeans ever grew in
volume never a man turned from the
path once he had found it

  curiosity sent saunders into the line
and held him there for nothing in the
way of orthodox amusement that he
knew of in palemibang had power
enough to draw such a crowd it was
in the thinly populated quarter north
of the tuwn near by the newest oil wells
that the stream of pleasure seekers was
halted to change from a current to a
lake of patience it was half an hour
before saunders reached a small wicket
through which tickets were handed in
exchange for gold and past which the
crowd were admitted cwo by two into
a dingy malodorous barn and pasted
on the wooden wall beside the ticket
window was a glaring poster-depicting
two all but naked pugilists in attitudes
of gentlemanly slaughter to be done
with gloves

grand

championship fight to-night

contest for the

heavy weight championship of the east
indies and a purse of  guilders

red beauchamp

v

dan mallet

  it was mallets name unexpectedly
leaping out at him from the poster
which first brought a grin to the skip-
pers face his long wait in the line
had increased the irritation of the days
happenings until on arrival at the
wicket he was more fit to partake of a
fight than to watch one he laughed
outright and paused before the win-
dow withholding his money and keep-
ing back the entire line then a glitter-
ing figure of soaped hair and glass dia-
monds with a screaming suit of petti-

coat lane clothes bustled through the
impatient throng and caught the dip-
pers arm

  keep movin buddy he gargled
if yuh dont wanna see a good fight
dont stop others

  saunders slapped the mans hand
aside easily and gave him one swift
indifferent look the fellow was of a
type utterly obnoxious to him a greasy
mouthy showman with mourning edg-
ing to his finger nails and a crooked
twist to his lips not by any means due
alone to the muscular effort needed to
sustain the great black cheroot with
which he polluted the already fetid air
there was something vaguely familiar
too about the man but so vague that
saunders felt certain the familiarity
was only impersonal that he had never
met the man actually or had dealings
with iim but the crowded passage
way behind was noisy with demands for
movement and even the skippers hard
sinewy weighty frame could not longer
hold back the pressure the flashy
showman tried again to remove the ob-
struction

  say capn let the boys through
wont yuh whats up with the show
that yuh aint goin in yer-elf

  there wont be any show laughed
saunders and men who had taken their
tickets and passed inside men who were
in the act of buying and a greater
number waiting still all halted in their
tracks and stared at the big cool sailor
who spoke in tones of certainty the
showman glanced around in alarm for
he scented diminished receipts even if
the statement proved false already men
at the rear of the line tired of waiting
drifted away on hearing those few dear
words spoken

  here what yuh mean he barked
wheezily whos goin to stop the
show whos goin to stop any show
dutch zimmerman puts on hey

  saunders looked at the man curi-
ously and the smile crept into his eyes
the redhead



  so youre dutch zim are your i
wondered what sort of looking creature
you were not so much dutch about
you as i supposed

  never mind me or the dutch part
capn snarled zim are you goin
to stop my show if thats yer game
who are yuli 

  the crowd surged forward howling
now for explanations instead of tickets
from inside dribbled uneasy patrons in
two minds about demanding their
money back

   wont stop your show any more
than i have already grinned the skip-
per ignoring the demand for his iden-
tity i came to see tihe scrap but
one of your men mallet is in hospital
with a broken arm and a fat jaw so
thats why i say the show wont go on
aw yer lyin some trick o bet-
tin or something

  the skipper smiled more genially but
let the lie pass for the moment

  im telling you straight news he
said i put dan mallet into hospital
myself so i know

  mention of mallet again recalled the
unsatisfactory events of the earlier day
jes lter everything which had gone
to pile irritation on irritation his
temper was ready to burst out but he
controlled it he heard zim mutter in
awed tones then you must be red
saunders by himmel aint nobody
else able to put dan in hospital
then rather louder and with a half
hopeful note you ought to find me
another man then capn my shows
spoiled if that light dont go on and i
spent a lot o money gettin permission
to hold this yer championship and the
army and navy big-heads are coinin
in force besides a lot o high gazabos
who can either make or bust a feller
in a dozen ways cant yuh rake me
up a sailor

  ill go on myself if youll take the
other corner smiled die skipper zim
flashed a suspicious glance up at him

but saunders gave no sign of having
heard what runacres had told him that
day

  aw quit foolin saunders zim
grumbled uneasily i aint in condi-
tion why dont yuh go on anyhow
theres money in it and these big-guns
here will do a lot for a good scrapper
red stepped inside the barn and
glanced around in the center stood the
ring elevated four feet from the un-
even floor but the interruption at the
ticket window had drawn all the early
comers back to-the door a scanty score
of spectators avatched the performance
of a very gory hit-or-miss preliminary
between a pair of malay boys the
tier of boxes however built along one
side of the ropes seemed to hint at
something of importance coming off
later sufficiently attractive to draw
such folks as those boxes were suitable
for and there was trade to be gouged
out of paletnbang for the black pearls
yawning hold

  how much is the purse in real
money zim

  see the bill dont yuh

  i said real money

  the thousand guilders is real hard
cash and theres no fake about it
either and winner takes all

  a draw splits it

  aw there aint goin to be no draw
how can there in a finish fight unless
its crooked  i dont pay on no draw
ill go on wheres a dressing
room zim turned excitedly to the
waiting crowd and bellowed git yer
tickets lads then led the way past the
ring to a small room beyond as he
stood aside for saunders to enter in-
dicating a pair of trunks and shoes on
a chair the utterly sunny smile on the
skippers face was turned full upon him

  dont fergit red i dont pay on
no draw he stated with fine emphasis
misreading that smile had he known
saunders by more than report he

  of a raging anger had impelled the
auburn adonis to take such means to
work it off as filling another man s
corner in a championship prize fight
without a moments preparation

  zira youre windy smiled the skip-
per with a swift movement he seized
the blatant showmans wrist between
thumb and two fingers and drew him
nearer have the thousand guilders
at the ringside before  step through
the ropes he said if a draw it is
youll pay on a draw little one see
with the word he pinched the thick
wrist without apparent intention and
zim squirmed in any company other
than that of a splendid human mode
such as saunders was dutch zim
migiht have passed for at leat a he-man
in physique but here he knew lie was
overweighted outclassed without
more than a scowl he left the dressing-
room and saunders prepared for the
bout

  as he lounged at his door in trunks
and shoes watching the closing rounds
of die last preliminary bout he heard
a cheerful laugh not far away and a
voice with a varsity accent drawled

  what rippin sports those chaps are
by jove the bally timekeepers wang-
ling the clock on em like anything

  the speaker stood in shadow but a
wall lamp beyond shed a little patch of
light over part of his face and his head
the first glimpse of his visible parts
drew a delighted chuckle from the
skipper the face was keen refined
strong a black-rimmed monocle stuck
in one eye curiously seemed to belong
there and not to be worn for effect
but it was the hair which drew saun-
ders closest attention

  by godfrey if im red then that
chaps ruby grinned saunders the
mans hair glinted in the kerosene flare
like red paint rather than copper

  the bout in the ring was terminated
suddenly and then a hitsll settled over
the house for a moment to murmur and

gradually grow into a roar of exject-
ancy

  main bout in the ring called some-
body and red saunders climbed
through the ropes leisurely and stood in
a corner for the first time feeling a
curiosity as to whom he was to meet

  dutch zim clambered up to the plat-
form and announced to the uniformed
occupants of the boxes

  a accident havin busted up dan
mallet one of the principals in the
main bout the accident lias agreed to
take his place and meet red beauchamp
for the championship of sumatra an
the dutch east indies gentlemen i
dont ask indulgence fer the substitute
red saunders gentlemen is no
stranger in this part o the world
stand up red

  saunders was -till standing smiling
good-hu mo redly out at the crowd seeth-
ing within with the irritations of the
day he waved his gloves by their
strings and retorted shortly

  bring on your husky tough dont
waste wind

  he heard comments not at all sub-
dued from the boxes and fnjpt seats
and knew realizing it with a trace of
the smile which was not a register of
his anger that his appearance in the
ring had created something of a sensa-
tion then he felt rather tjhan saw hi
opponent crawl through the ropes oppo-
site and dutch zims raucous bellcnv
told all and sundry that

  red beaudhanip gents will defer-
the title he gets by forfeit owin to dan
mallets absence red beauchamp
gents in this corner fight to a finish
small gloves queensbttry rules red
saunders-red beauchamp

  zim ducked out and the seconds
came in to lace on the gloves then
saunders saw who his opponent was
it was the monocled stranger with the
varsity  accent and he was looking
straight over at saunders with the eye
of humorous appraisal nobody in
 the redheads

sumatra could have looked less the part
of a bruiser nobody more like a school-
boy suddenly released from irksome
studies and cast into a whirl of every
boyish delight he had ever dreamed
about and he still wore his monocle
hung by a narrow black ribbon about
his neck wore the glass and bubbled
over with glee

  oh i say he cried shoving his
handlers aside and running across the
ring i was expecting to meet some
broken-nosed bruiser old chap glad
youre not one never get much sport
out of the regular pug

  saunders met his opponent with a
smile as free and a note as joyous

  i rather expected to find that ijprt
too he grinned rather sorry its
ou iin spoiling for a scrap busi-
ness worries and that sort of thing
yknow im murderous well call it
off if you like

  not at all beauchamp lauglhed
happily ive just heard some corkin
good news and only a rousing good
bout with the dukes will serve as a
safety valve

  hey whats the game roared a
drunken voice from the rear seats is
this a brothely chinnin match or a
fight hey i aint paid ten guilders to
see no lcissin contest between a dude
and his long-lost brother get busy
his fears had no foundation beau-
champ returned to his corner his gloves
were laced on and the referee briefly
gaibbled the chief rules concerning hit-
ting in the breaks and then the time-
keeper barked

  first roufid-second-s out-time
the championship bout vtfas on
dutch zim left the ticket wicket and
toolk up a stand by a corner post and
with one eye on him and one on the
ftgiht billy runacres sat in an end box
in company with two eager-faced
bright-eyed girls whose expressions of
astonishment at first soon gave way to



deepest personal interest in the com-
batants

  why my dear hes positively hand-
some whispered bubble jess chum

  thats why i love him replied
jess albservtly

  oh fudge i mean the other one
was the rejoinder

chapter iii

  that contest started with a hand-
shake the warmth of which perhaps
gave grounds for supposing that the
championship would produce but an in-
different set-to but once squared off
the clean-limibed clear-eyed boxers
speedily had the impatient crowd sitting
breathless in their seats their hands
had scarcely parted when beauchamp
younger than saunders by ten good
years led with a solid left to the eye
which was countered like a streak of
light they stepped back under die
almost simultaneous blows and laugihed
happily each knowing from the weight
of that initial encounter that he faced
a real opponent then their bodies
came together with a thud and gloves
impacted against flesh with the rhythm
of drum beats making the shaky ring
floor - again and each punch
brought an appreciative grin from the
recipient and a retort in kind

  scissors chuckled billy runacres
pinching the girls elbows joyfully its
just like a varsity final thisll beat
anything in the professional bruiser line
i ever saw

 but arent they hurting each other
whispered bubbles wide-eyed and
breathless

  you couldnt hurt red with gloves
and the other chaps smiling isnt he
returned jess leaning forward eagerly

 the round ended beauchamp
laughed like a happy boy as he went to
his corner and the smile on saunders
face had begun to change from the
ultra-sunny smile of anger to that less


 

brilliant softer smile of rising content-
ment jess saw the change and sighed
as if a load had been lifted from her
mind

  the barn was in an uproar of excite-
ment whatever had been feared when
the contestants met in that unusual
handshake the first round had put it
right the spectators were gelling their
moneys worth

  as the second round proceeded with
faster action and heavier exchanges but
with little to dhoose between the con-
testants the betting wavered from one
to the other and when the gong
sounded again sending the men to their
corners dutch zim beckoned one of
his hirelings and sent him to find out
and report just how the betting was
going from time to time

  midway through the third round
beauchamp got in a tremendous right
hook which caught the skipper coming
in and sent him crashing to the floor
the betting tout reported the odds
swinging toward beauchamp and a
big wager placed on him by the gover-
nor saunders was on his feet still
grinning cheerfully before three had
been counted over him and beauchamp
stepping in to repeat met a swing with
his chin which hurled him into the oppo-
site corner to collide with the ring post
the official face of the governor re-
tained its outward calm but his eyes
hardened as he saw his wager in peril
and most of the calm fled in the next
second when saunders followed up his
advantage and dropped beauchamp to
the floor with a right uppercut as he
lurched away from the post

  the ring shook to his fall then
the gong rang for the end of the round 
time saved him and zim hurriedly got
men to prop up the tottering posts

  the men faced each other again and
now their cheery grins were somewhat
marred by dark patches around the eyes
and chins but they were enjoying the
battle with all the keenness of clean

  peoples story magazine

healthy sportsmen beauchamp re-
covered swiftly from the shaking up of
the round before and his greater youth
began to tell his speed increased
while saunders feu back upon stubborn
defensive fighting which was little les
deadly than his attack and called less
on his reserve vitality

  this combined with a sudden fierce
rally from beauchamp swung the bet-
ting odds again and the governors
face lighted up the tout reported tu
zim the placing of another big wager
six rounds that contest went swaying
first to one side and then to the other
and the referee would have had a hard
time picking a winner on points but
in the seventh with the official bets
mdtmting into big money indeed and
saunders recovering his speed and
effectiveness dutch zims face grew
worried he was ever looking anxiously
toward the boxes trying to read ex-
pressions

  runacres was watching the move-
ments of dutch zim as the seventh
round went on he stood close up
against the corner post that had been
propped up and the ring now shook
and creaked with every movement of
the men saunders forced a swift rally
driving beauchamp against the ropes
and zim flashed a glance behind the
governors box where a sycophantic
junior official was making signs run-
acres sensed something wrong but
could not place it at the moment he
felt a strong touch on his shoulder
and turned to meet tod carter whose
rugged honest face was clouded by a
scowl

  looks like a dirty play dont it
mr runacres tod muttered
thought id be handy to lend a hand

  beauchamp caught in a corner was
rocking under the pile-driver punches
of the grinning skipper his own
smeared face still wearing a smile but
his knees shaking across the ring the
toady behind the boxes signaled fran-
the redheads

tically and when it seemed certain that
the championship of sumatra and the
dutch east indies belonged to the black
pearls skipper down crashed the ring
in a cloud of dust and a tangle of ropes
and posts

  then pandemonium burst loose the
smoky foul-aired barn rang to the
rafters with the howls of chagrined
gamblers and lower animals robbed of
the climax to what promised to be a
bloody fight in the boxes the official
patrons stared at the wreck for a mo-
ment then began to leave their seats
dutch zim screamed frantically at the
referee and that bewildered function-
ary climbed upon the heap of planks
and yelled

  gentlemeni all bets are oft the
fights a draw it will be put off until
a date to be set later thank you one
and all gents leave by all doors

  runacres started down toward the
ring for jess shriek rang unpleasantly
in his ears but tod carter dragged
him badk

  stay with the ladies mister run-
acres growled the grim old mate
this is my job

  pie leaped over the intervening rows
of benches and reached the pile of
debris out of which saunders was try-
ing to haul beauchamp both men
were scratched and bruised beyond any-
thing the contest had done to them and
saunders dragged a limping leg behind
him which he could not yet assure him-
self was not broken at least in some
small bone beauchamp who was
under-dog at the moment of collapse
emerged looking like the victim of an
earthquake

  here yare capn roared carter
plunging forward and hurling plank-
aside like straws saunders flashed a
look of glad recognition to his mate
then his face hardened with an anger
which was proof even against his habit
of smiling in a rage

  carter look after this chap he

 

barked and without waiting to see if
he were obeyed he plunged out of the
chaos and hurled himself upon dutch
zim who was prying with a corner-
post at a heap of heavy beams saun-
ders had not mistaken the mans de-
liberate intention it meant murder or
maiming if those beams fell before
beauchamp and himself were clear and
the big skipper had handled such men
as dutch zim often before

  hey hold off red bawled zim
with a futile attempt at guarding him-
self from the gloved fist reaching out
for him im try in to get yuh clear
aint i

  ill get you clear grunted saun-
ders tearing his gloves off

  he capsized the ring skipper
yelled carter with beauchamps arms
about his shoulders beauchamp
hauled himself out by gripping the
mate tightly and leaped down beside
saunders who now faced not only zim
but both gangs of seconds and a swarm
of hangers-on dutch zim plucked
loose his pry and held it as a fender
between him and the menacing skipper

  did the rotter really let us down 
demanded beauchamp screwing his
monocle into his eye it had flapped
at his back all through the contest
fastened to his neck by the ribbon he
peered down at the scowling crook curi-
ously by jove dutch i believe
youre a scoundrel he said and a long
arm reached out and grabbed the show-
man by the hair zim shook himself
free of the ineffectual grip of the
gloved hand and brandished his piece
of timlber

  boys these guys is going to beat me
upr he cried put em outside

  a sudden onset drove the three com-
rades back for a moment and the few
spectators who had loitered behind after
the ring collapsed departed hurriedly
beams and pieces of flooring whirled
aloft and tod carter staggered back
with a smashed hat and a scraped fore-




people s story magazine

  head saunders snatched the dub away
from carters assailant and drove it
home in a thrust which robbed the man
of breath for an hour afterwards and
in the same breath beauchamp tore off
one glove whipped up a water bucket
and crowned zim

  things were not going right for
dutch zim jess and bubbles wide-
eyed spectators of this aftermath of the
prize fight found cause for mirth in the
picture of the greasy showman eclipsed
by a zinc pail and their rippling
laughter reached his red ears even
through the muffling metal saunders
and his friends were backing away to
get their clothes when zim yelled some-
thing in a mongrel dialect of dutch and
malay and like a flood a score of men
surged upon them knives flashing

  i say this isnt the game you
know protested beauchamp putting
the period to his protest with a straight
punch from the shoulder which loosened
the teeth of the foremost knifer

  stand aside shrilled a girlish
voice and billy runacres leaped down
to the floor and ducked yelling to saun-
ders and the others to follow suit they
dipped and a pistol in jess steady
hand began to stream bullets among the
knife men they stopped in their
tracks their hang-dog faces lost all their
truculence and they glared appealingly
at zim for advice

  get to your holes said saunders
incisively fixing his smiling glance upon
the rabble while his long arms reached
out again and grabbed dutdi zim
beauchamp and tod carter aided now
by billy runacres picked up weapons
and advanced and another shot from
jess decided the riot

  hey where you fellers haulin me
to blustered zim helpless in the iron
grip of the seething skipper

into the dressing room first until
we dress grinned saunders then
to the ticket office to get our money
i told yuh i wouldnt pay on no

draw  twas a draw wasnt it
aint that what yuh understood beau-
champ 

   er yes  believe so hesitated the
monocled one dropping his glass and
turning an embarrassed face upon the
skipper that was the understanding
old chap he said

   t hen you need educating in the
school of swindling my monocled
friend derided saunders retaining
his hold on the showman  under-
stood the purse would lie paid whatever
the result because this crook capsized
the works and stopped the scrap mak-
ing it a draw automatically is no reason
why he should make a thousand
guilders out of us billy runacres you
look after jess and bubbles unless
this greasy swab produces the coin
within five minutes whatll happen to
him isnt going to be nice for ladies to
see

  he began dressing with a cheerful
grin and beauchamp feeling irresist-
ibly drawn to this masterful mariner
who so lately had tried hard to knock
his head off grinned in entire sym-
pathy and slipped his own clothes on
with none of his customary fastidious
care tod carter grinned in the door-
way having relieved saunders as cus-
todian of zim and the combined effect
of those three strong clean smiling
faces proved too much for the show-
man

  say yuh damn highbinders he
snarled uneasily ill pay yuh but
watch out you saunders you dont get
no fat thousand out o me without a
comeback i warn yuh

  kick him inside to me carter
smiled saunders and readied out a
hand like a grappling iron dutch zim
wilted

  oh  know all about yer strong
arm he yelled you got the bulge
now but ive told yuh come on
carter or whatever yer name is ill

pay
the redheads

  tod carter took him to the ticket
window and received a bag of cash
over the ledge he demanded a count
and forced it against all protests with
a pistol which looked as big as a moun-
tain howitzer to zim then he reached
inside took out the key and locked the
showman up in his own sanctum

  an hour later a merry party gathered
around the table at supper in a private
room in the hotel where jess had taken
rooms billy runacres had adopted the
smile which seemed to be common to
all the rest and the only person present
who did not smile quite happily was
jess who was not yet reconciled to see-
ing red saunders grinning through a
split lip and out of a half-closed eye
and one quite shut

  beauchamp was in little better case
but his battered appearance could not
disguise the fact that he was a gentle-
man to the toes and the happy boyish
enthusiasm with which he had accepted
reds appellation of ruby endeared him
to everybody

  dont see what else you could dub
me in this company he laughed star-
ing at saunders ruddy thatch i
should have considered that mop of hair
a decent shade of vermilion-nodding
across the talble-had i not seen both
our heads together in the mirror mine
is rather vivid i confess

  good for you ruby beauchamp
grinned saunders youre elected to
the red circle might as well know
who your friends are now this is
jess saunders her chum is muriel
vincent-bubbles for short this is
billy runacres british consul tod
carter there is my chief and only mate
i am saunders skipper of the black
pearl schooner at present looking for
business and having nothing in sight

 ee-saunders by any chance
kenneth saunders who got his rowing
boxing and football blues at oxford
fifteen years ago or so 

  thats a hit of past history which i



dont insist upon my friends knowing
smiled red

  jove might i ask what in creation
induced you to hop into a ring to meet
an ostensible bruiser for a piffling
championship fight not money
surely 

  no laughed saunders heartily
i insdsted on getting the cash simply
because i believe in paying my own
engagements and insist on receiving
payment when due to me i managed
to stumble on that fight to-night in look-
ing for something to take some of my
megrims away and discovered that one
of the principals in the big battle was
my one-voyage mate whom i had an
hour or so earlier walloped into hos-
pital taking his place seemed like
manna in the wilderness to me i
crawled through the ropes filled with a
volcanic temper which demanded some-
thing in the way of a real scrap to calm
it i told you i felt murderous didnt
i but you money

  ruby beauchamp laughed as heartily
as saunders had done

  not at all a day or so ago i con-
tracted to do it for filthy lucre simply
because i was broke to the wide wide
world but to-niglit i felt so blooming
happy and buoyant that while i had
no longer any need to do it i had to
carry on or burst with joy old chap
and if i may say so i believe i gave
you a tussle didnt i

  it was a bit hot on both sides billy
runacres put in with a chuckle dye
know the girls saiw the bills of that
fight with dan mallets name on em
and made me take em hoping to
see mallet pummeled properly jess
left a note for you saunders telling
you where we had gone i knew youd
follow but we hardly expected to find
you one of the chief actors run-
acres flashed a whimsical glance at
beauchamp then at bulbbles funny
thing though the girls were not at all
disappointed when they saw who was
peoples story magazine

iu the iug- they both expressed a
hope that red would win

  of course we did cried jess
warmly bubbles glared at billy run-
acres and blushed

chapter iv

  the main point is remarked run-
acres that yon will have to keep your
eye on dutch zim saunders the
girls had retired after supper leaving
the men deep in a business discussin
for all his greasy villainy he pulls a
strong rope with some of the big men
here and as  told you might be the
case it is zim who is responsible for
the lack of business youve found here
the executive in palembang is all
right straight as a string but hes sur-
rounded by fawning aids who are not
apt to be so straight as he is

  i dont remember ever clashing with
him remarked red thoughtfully
but if hes playing that game i can
play it as well i can whip a dozen
ike dutch zim at any game straight
or crooked ill have a talk with him
in the morning

  better sleep on it anyhow advised
runacres one thing you will not do
cannot do and that is play any sort of
shady game even to beat a rascal like
zim anotfher thing is you cant buck
against a government with a european
nation behind it i hate to say it red
but i think your best plan would be to
try other ports for a while theres
good demand for bottoms across the
straits i hear

  that i will not do retorted saun-
ders emphatically id be ashamed to
shave if i let myself be run off any
trading ground like that

  what has shaving to do with it
draiwled beauchamp

  id have to look myself in the face
wouldnt i

  ruby beauchamp chuckled with
relish

  i say old chap he said  think
theres no need for you to gro-u whis-
kers yet suppose you let me edge in
a word  told you in the ring to-night
that  had heard some good news 
have  heard it a few days ago i
got some funds wtaich had been hanging
fire for years and i bought a big tract
of oil and rubber land up near the hills
at the headwaters of the kampar im
going up there to egin piling up the
shekels saunders and i can fill your
schooner with material and supplies if
you want to take the charter

  hm grunted saunders its a
sporting offer beauchamp but its a
short haul i could only freight your
goods into the kampar estuary not
more than halfway to pulu la wan and
the rate would knock holes in your
profits for years to come youd have
to hire boats as far as the village and
carriers after that afraid i cant
gouge you for what the job would be
worth to me old fellow thanks

  rot i have to pay anyhow dont
i you ruddy idiot besides id like
to have you join me we ought to pull
together pretty well and a pair of red-
heads like you and me should burn up
any and all obstacles what

  that sounds good saunders
hinted runacres who had been keenly
regarding beauchamps animated face
which lost nothing of strength by the
addition of the monocle tod carter
sat in silent anxiety hoping that the
skipper would accept for the mere men-
tion of oil and rubber spelled wealth
untold to his simple seamans mind

  furthermore added beauchamp
you can carry the right kind of boats
straight from here i can engage all
the men you can spare of your crew
and carter here as well runacres will
look after your interests whether here
or up in the kampar i think and no
doubt hell be glad to keep an eye on
the ladies
the redheads



  saunders suddenly sat upright and
grinned pleasantly

  do you imagine you can leave the
girls behind he asked

  why you surely dont mean to say
they would chance such a journey
beauchamp was frankly astonished

  some day ask jess to tell you about
her adventures in zanzibar the skip-
per chuckled bubbles is built from
the same pattern theyre woolen
goods a full yard wide you may
count them in the party ruby
youll join me

  ill freight you to the river any-
how well get to a more definite con-
clusion after youve outlined exactly
what you propose to do with your pur-
chase meet me here for lunch to-
morrow you too runacres of course
carter you can go on board and take
charge right away if you find any of
mallets things left behind send em up
to the hospital in the morning

  beauchamp arrived an hour before
luncheon in the morning and his good-
looking face was clouded with annoy-
ance

  whats wrong inquired saunders
anything gone wrong with your
proposition 

  it seems doubtful now that there
will be any proposition replied ruby
seriously ive jus-t been advised that
the title i bought to those lands is
valueless i wanted to see runacres
about it

  who told you demanded saun-
ders sharply

kempees  van zoom the lawyers
crooks was the bulletlike an-
swer i know them they were at
the ringside last night looking sick
until the ring collapsed

  come -to think remarked ruby i
met dutch zim just outside the kem-
pees office

  shouldnt wonder if you did but
red lowered his voice and treading
like a cat reached the closed door
bpeo

cherchez la-he flung open the door
an elderly malay chambermaid tumbled
in-femme he concluded with a
chuckle

  by jove

  yes by jane too if we put two
and two together and it only makes
three were missing a count somewhere
old top we assume zim has put a
spoke into your wheel we know he
isnt any friend of mine or my people
but about the only reason why he
should try tricks on you at this time is
because there is a chance of my work-
ing with you in your interests and
the only way he could discover that so
quickly is by tod carter talking-
which is absurd as old friend euclid
says-or through some such agent as
this he seized the trembling woman
by a skinny arm and swung her into a
chair

  how much is dutch zim paying you
for sneaking around my door hey

  the woman swept him with a sharp
glance of her beady black eyes and
showed an irregular row of yellow
teeth

  nothing she snapped i not
sneakin

  tell me the truth or ill punish
you

  i not tellin and you not punishin
you let me go

  saunders released her but stood
close by

  beauchamp run down to the wharf
and hail carter he said quietly
bring him here with a couple of men
in a hurry

  the womans eyes wavered for a
moment then dropped and her leathery
face grew inscrutable saunders
locked the door after beauchamp and
without haste as coolly as if he were
baling up a bundle of treiglht he
whipped off a pillow cover and flung it
over the womans head and shoulders
then tearing down a wide split-bamiboo
water-dash on the wall he rolled her
- 

peoples story magazine

up in it a la cleopatra going to an-
tony and fastened the bundle with
jess trunk straps

  in little more than half an hour beau-
champ brought tod carter back with
him and reported two able gilbert
islanders at die service door below

  get em up and cart this bundle
aboard the schooner saunders
ordered handle it so that it doesn t
squeak and when youve unwrapped it
lock it in the trade room and feed it
until i come down and start putting
the pearl iu sea trim he added as the
mate went out followed by the grinning
seamen with their burden

  red and ruby ate lunch together
impatient for the return of runacres
wken he arrived he brought jess and
bubbles with him and his expression
was one of mixed satisfaction and dis-
gust

  that fellow zim has stirred up a
wasps nest somehow he said youd
better snatcii up beauchamps sugges-
tion and pull out as soon as you can

  i want to talk to you about that
beauchamp said with an awkward
laugh i understand my title to the
lands is no good kempees  van
zoom told me so

  the girls looked hungrily at the
empty dishes on the table lunch was
brought up for them and billy run-
acres sat down to join tfhem

  have you got those title deeds
here he asked tackling a hot dish of
curry beauchamp handed them to
him and he propped the papers against
a fruit dish and perused them as he
ate twice he went through them with-
out comment then folded them and put
them into his inside pocket

  ill have these searched properly
he said if youre not tired of hear-
ing my suggestions i make one now
that you carry on as you proposed last
night-all of you he glanced at
saunders doubtfully before he asked
by the way red cant you recall any

clash with dutch zim nothin in

zanzibar 

  jess iwoked up quickly and she and
red exchanged glances both shook
their heads however until runacres
prompted

  wasmt there some sort of mix-up
between you and the sultan or his
officers about the time of the last bom-
bardment 

  there surely was exclaimed jess
could i forget it

  saunders laughed

  we had a little fuss yes billy but
i dont recall any white man whose toes
i trod on

  call it a little fuss if you like you
old pirate grinned runacres it
sounded more like a war-the way i
heard it but try hard wasnt there
a matter of a kidnaped harem and a
treasure dhow sunk and another full
of the sultans choicest rascals driven
away into portugese waters think

  all of em but the white man-

  dutch zim was in command of the 
dhow that you chased away just when
he had his hands on the treasure ship
the devil but it isnt likely billy
when i met the blackguard at the
ticket window last night he seemed sur-
prised when he discovered who i was
he never met you in zanzibar in
person and i dont believe you saw
him but he heard about you all right
and hasnt forgotten the haul you
plucked out of his fingers anyhow
hes after you with a pull big enough
to upset anything i can do unless i
make an international affair of it cant
see my way to doing that old fellow

  of course you cant wouldnt ex-
pect it in any case im able to play
off my own bat if it comes to that
he figured on the chair-arm with a stub
of pencil and presently remarked
about three hundred miles up to
singapore less than sixty back to the
kampar estuary say three days at
the redheads



most wasted ritfby where is your
stuff

  some of its in a godown on the
river just below the steamer wharf
the rest barrin my personal luggage
is floating in the half-dozen shallow
boats ive bought for the kampar river
theyre moored off the dock with a
watchman for each why

  saunders ignored the question for the
moment

  billy he said turning to the consul
in case im delayed can you get my
clearance for singapore to-day 
certainly going to try fresh
fields runacres answered eagerly
beauahainp looked glum

  im going to freight beaurfiamp and
his gear right up to his property if
you report his title clear so if you
find thats o k you can clear me for
singapore laden with general cargo
for orders ill send you the manifest
and the crew list yon ruby can go
aboard the schooner with your baggage
and tell carter to drop down and pick
up the rest of your stuff im as sure
that your title is good as i am of my
own ownership of the schooner tell
carter we sail to-night on the first of
the ebbs

  then turning to the girls he smiled
quizzically

  better think it over girls you can
stay here with runacres or stop over
in singapore or come right along but
i can only promise you hardship and
rough going if you choose to come with
us

  the girls exchanged glances

  unless youre growing- foolish you
know my answer said jess with a toss
of the head and a flirt of her sunny
curls

  i saw a fight for the first time last
night said bubbles if i travel with
the two ruffians whom i saw fighting i
may see some more bully good sport
im going

  then pack up and be ready when i

come for you in two hours he told
them and left on private -business of
his own

chapter v

  first dispatching a cablegram to an
agent in singapore advising him in
code of the schooners sailing and prob-
able time of arrival saunders hurried
through the less frequented stores and
purchased additional equipment for his
party

  he had rummaged small stores for
his goods in preference to the greater
shops wishing to keep as little to the
fore as possible but once his work was
done he emerged into the broader
thoroughfares and showed himself open-
ly in the guise of an idler two ob-
jects were in his mind then he
wanted if possible to find a guide for
the upper kampar country and if in
addition he could square accounts with
dutch zim before he sailed his content-
ment would be almost complete

  with both objects in view he walked
past the blaring office of kempees 
van zoom solicitors who derived the
bulk of their income from a species of
land-grabbing chicanery for a fee
suitably fat they would prove the
devils title to hades a worthless piece
of aslbestos paper and since beau-
champs announcement of their opinion
regarding his title red had felt a grow-
ing certainty that dutch zim could be
found hovering about their hive wait-
ing for the sticky honey he hoped they
would squeeze out to him

  on his first turn past the door saun-
ders collided with billy runacres and
the consuls face was dark with anger

  oh here you are he cried come
along down the street a bit red say
can you pull out sooner than ebb tide 

  as soon as beauchamps gears
shipped replied saunders but well
have to tow out then of course
why

well ive been searching that title
peoples story magazine

im certain its as clear as daylight
red but those sharks ive just left
seem to have something up their
sleeve

  have you cleared the schooner

  yes did that first tiling dutch
zim was down at the customhouse i
noticed

  all right billy well pull out the
minute were ready if i dont see you
again for a while so long and thanks

  they gripped hands warmly and
parted saunders turned and walked
past the lawyers office again smiling
softly and whistling through his teeth
he carried a stout pliable wanghee
cane and as he stepped leisurely across
the pavement he made the stick sing
through the air in time with his rollick-
ing tune

  then he remembered he needed a
guide and swung about to follow run-
acres and ask his advice so doing he
came face to face with dutch zim
hurrying up from the direction of the
customhouse and just entering the
office as once before he imagined
that smile and that merry tune to
mean that red saunders was in an
innocuous mood and following- the
line of thought since his own mood was
one of jubilation he accosted the sailor
with insolence and bluster

  himmel but you look like a crow
with them black eyes red i know a
good doctor on malay street ill give
you his address then you can get your
tamps cleaned in singapore his
clumsy jocularity possessed no vitality
however and he reverted to his more
natural style of address saunders
stood before him smiling unruffled
idly whipping his leg with his wanghee
 youre gain to singapore aint yuh
nothin doin in rubber or oil hey i
told yuh and that pink-headed snoozer
beauchamp that yuh couldnt gouge no
wad o monejr outa dutch zimmerman
without a comeback didnt i

  with a sneering guffaw the fellow

set his foot on the step of the office
feeling quite safe even it that smiling
face before him should change saun-
ders appeared unconscious of die taunt
he gazed absently up and down the
street for a moment then like a snake
it struck his cane thrust hard and
straight into zinis generous paunch
bringing him halfway to his knees with
a grunt too short of wind to shout

  still without haste saunders seized
him in one powerful hand while he still
bent over in breathless distress and
with a grip like an oaken clamp held
him there while the wanghee whistled
in the air down it whizzed and met
the tight portion of zims nether attire
with a crack like a gunshot the vic-
tim roared lustily and saunders quick-
ened his stroke in fear that he might be
interrupted before he had finished the
lesson

from near by sounded a cracked
hoarse voice raised in unmusical song
if yer outside jnh cant be inside

if yer inside yuh cant be out-

  the song stopped abruptly as the
singer rounded the corner and took in
the scene then drowning the roars
of dutch zim as the rattle of a train
will drown the murmur of a distant
brook the song rose redoubled in noise
if yer outside yuh cant be in by a damn
sight haw haw haw

  saunders leaned over his squirming
victim and spoke in a quiet penetrating
tone

  thanks for the otter of the doctors
address zim yes im going to sing-
apore theres something doing still in
oil and rubber and-with a parting
tremendoun whack-there s no come-
back for a has-been

  saunders released him and glanced
at the noisy songster a grin broke
over his face at sight of him a grin of
genuine amusement the fellow leaned
against the house wall laughing down
at the groveling zim who was picking
himself up in color he had certainly


the redheads



once been white tout now he was a rich
chocolate hue his hair had been
bleached by sun and sea to the neutral
shade of dead straw for dress he
wore his birthday suit scantily fortified
by a nondescript square of rag about
his loins as a human specimen his
shape was that of a distance runner
rather than of a wrestler-lean lithe
lathy and there was a merry impudent
light in his black eyes which made one
forget the beautiful ugliness of his face
barelegged barefooted bare-armed
he revealed a score of old scars of dif-
ferent kinds on shins forearms and
feet behind him taking no apparent
interest in the strange doings of the
white men two smaller men stood pa-
tiently waiting for him they were
natives dressed as he was little differ-
ing in color but of malay or hindoo-
malay blood unmistakably and in
the road of the sride street down which
they had just appeared a covered bul-
lock cart stood a foolish-faced driver
staring open-mouthed at the group on
the pavement

 finished with him guvnor
laughed the nondescript

  saunders nodded

  then ill take him i been looking
for him all the way from achin head

  dutch zim started up at the words
and tone peering into the mans laugh-
ing face his mouth opened as if to
yell for help and the naked man uttered
a series of grunts rapidly like two
brown ghosts the natives slithered for-
ward and fell upon dutch zim his
roar was choked off and in less time
than is required to tell it they had him
trussed the brown-white man leaped
to the seat of the bullock cart and
stopped the drivers frightened howl
with threat of a knife mysteriously pro-
duced out of his waist cloth

if yer inside yuli cant be out by a damn
    sight haw haw hawl

  the man roared drowning effectually
whatever noise was made in loading

zim into the cart saunders felt a
growing curiosity concerning the queer
stranger who knew so well how to go
straight to a desired point he stepped
up to the cart

  where are you taking him he
asked smiling

  going to give him a little ride the
man grinned back cheerfully not so
long as he gave me perhaps but as far
as this ancient bit o buffalo beef will
haul him

  wait a minute you say youve
come down from achin 

  every blessed yard guvnor on the
hoof too

  do you happen to know the kampar
country im looking for a guide
between us theres mighty few
square miles of sumatra we dont
know what dye want a guide for
breaking new ground im in a
hurry too sail this evening at latest
let your natives carry on with the
dutchman and come along the wages
will be right

  me leave my pals not much
say they are the only pair of real bat-
tak cannibals ever civilized enough to
follow a white man out of achin they
tried to eat me at that before i civilized
em by force of toughness and sheer
dog-gone cussedness and we wont
leave zim either now weve found him
already tamed for us after padding the
hoof a matter of six or seven hundred
males to get him

  saunders rarely made two guesses
about a man if he liked him at first
sight he wanted him and he had never
known his judgment to fail now
there was no man in sumatra whom he
would have considered for guide until
this queer hybrid of a man had defi-
antly refused the job

  bring your pals along too he sug-
gested and-

  at that moment kempees came out
of his office and passed along the street
people s story magazine

he flung a sneering laugh at sauuders
as he went by and he carried with him
a smug feeling tftiat the frank mile
with which the skipper answered his
laugh would soon be changed to a scowl
of defeat perhaps dutch zim would
have put him right had he been aible
to overcome the muting effect of a
jiltby loin-cloth stuffed into his mouth

  and what reminded the hybrid
specimen

  im going across to singapore first
said saunders and unless you intend
to murder zim you can take him along
too

  dont know about murder guvnor
but we surely dont propose giving him
a banquet and a speech of welcome
twasnt for that we raised blisters of
blood on our feetses

  well theres no time to discuss it
now as long ag you dont carve him
up and let your men eat him while hes
in my schooner i wont interfere i
dont love him myself will you
come 

  as far as singapore anyway be-
fore we get there well find some sweet
way of paying the bandicoot back you
wont be so squeamish when i tell you
the score against him

  then cart him down to the river
better bundle him up like freight he
pulls a heavy rope here my schooners
the black pearl and im saunders
master and owner

  call me tomking-yes one word-
tomking its the nearest to my name
these cannibals could get the man-
eaters are bang and kohl thats the
nearest i got to theirs well be there
as soon as you capn giddap there
the ox cart dawdled down the road
creaking and lurdhing and raising the
dust and saunders stood for a few min-
utes thinking over the things he had
set out to get and making sure that he
had forgotten nothing he satisfied
himself that nothing remained to pre-
vent him sailing at once if the others

were all as ready then he too strode
away toward the river

  and as he hurried away a sieek
slant-eyed celestial slipped out of an
adjacent doorway and into the law
office of kernpees  van zoom in
two minutes the chinaman emerged
with expressionless face and took up a
position beside the door with his eyes
wandering ever up and down the street
as if waiting with a patience due to
nothing else than inherent habit for
somebodys return

  when he reached the black pearl
saunders found his decks clear and
clean his hatches fastened down and
his able smiling crew of islanders
ready to jump at the orders of their
returned and affectionately regarded
tod carter at the forecastle hatch
squatted the two battaks with tom-
king standing by them looking as if he
wanted to give the orders to carry the
ship to sea his air was that of a sea-
man unmistakably in spite of his cloth-
ing or rather lack of it

  the girls were below putting their
cabins to rights and beauchamp was
not in evidence saunders asked carter
if he had come on board

  everybodys here capn and three
newr hands as look like a suit o clothes
might not be wasted on em grinned
tod mr beauchamps in the fore-
hold stowing dynamite the boats are
still overside swinging to their painters
i guessed the decks would better be
clear working out of the river and
theyll be handy if we want a boat in a
hurry to carry out a line ashore in case
we stick bucking the flood tide all the
gear that was in the boats is stowed
below

  wheres the bundle the three cupids
brought on board 

  they hove it down on top of the
cargo just forard of the trade-room
hatch grinned carter hope there
wasnt anything breakable in it

  the skipper stepped to the side and
the redheads

scanned the swirl of the stream the
flood tide ran strongly still but there
was a brisk wind from the south blow-
ing- fair down the river and if he meant
to pick up his anchor before the slack
water he might as well start right away

  all right tod he said man the
windlass

  twilight was deepening into dark
when the tide turned and permitted the
three towing rowfboats to drop back
then with slack water and a fair wind
together the schooner slipped fast
through the muddy water past low-
lying cotton fields and black patches of
jungle and the open sea was close
ahead saunders had ordered the eve-
ning meal to be set in half an hour
when out of the darkness astern pealed
a peremptory command to bring to

  sparks leaped up from the funnel of
a fast launch and in the light of the
fire as the stoker flung on more fuel
the figures of armed men could readily
be seen

  black pearl ahoy came the hail
again bring to or well fire into
you

  who are you roared saunders
loosening his heavy automatic in the
holster speak up quick 

  police boat v came the reply like a
shot

chapter vi

  the only way for a sailing vessel to
bring up in a fast-running river before
a fair wind is to get sail off and anchor
unless she can shoot alongside a deep-
water bank saunders edged wide to
the right hank put his helm hard over
and let go the headsails bringing the
schooner around in a broad arc the
anchor was let go in midstream and
the wildcat shot sparks as the iron cable
ripped out by the time the pursuing
laundh was aforeast the schooner was
at rest head to wind and tide head-
sails hanging loose and fore and main-
sails flapping idly

  what do you want the skipper
demanded sharply

  put a ladder over well board
you was the curt reply

  beauchamp hung over the low rail
curiously peering down in an effort to
distinguish personalities his con-
science was entirely clear he knew and
this nocturnal adventure on the very
eve of their journey to his new posses-
sions only aroused his latent love of
dramatic thrills jess and bubbles be-
side him chattered merrily in whispers
detecting absurdities in the shadowy
figures of the launchs people and find-
ing fun therein

  what do you want repeated the
skipper one hand on the ladder ropes
you dont board me in the dark with-
out giving me proof that you have
legitimate business with me speak up
sharp

  heres a warrant of search cap-
tain replied a nimble police officer
clambering up the side and showing a
paper duly drawn up and bearing the
official seal the man looked genuine
and saunders stood aside to let him
come on board but he resumed his
place as the rest climbed up and sud-
denly he put out his great hand and
pushed a climber back into the launch
with a thump

  you stay down there with the bal-
last van zoom if you come up here
ill tell my boy to spank you now
what do you want  he asked the police-
man

  piet zimmerman called dutch zim
replied the officer

  all right officer go ahead saun-
ders said shortly he was too busy
wondering how far this delay might go
to waste more time on the police
intruders he walked forward looking
for the two battaks and tomking to
advise them to make themselves incon-
spicuous  but they did not appear
carter could not say where they were
the gilbert island crew only grinned
peoples story magazine

negatively policemen were at the fore-
castle ladder two more had entered the
cabins and a man was loosening the
wedges of the hatch-battens i he
officer stood at the rail talking down
to van zoom

  j cant exceed the terms of the war-
rant mynheer said the officer in no
pleasant tones warrant to search is
all i have

  but i want this schooner held up
let your launch take me back to the
town while you make the search drag
out ill bring you a fresh warrant in
a couple of hours

  how far does your warrant go
now put in saunders quietly step-
ping beside the officer

  search your vessel for the person
of zimmerman and to take him off
is that exactly all

  yes its a hasty warrant anyhow
i dont like working on incomplete
orders like this thats why i sug-
gested that you might help me

  i cant help you i have seen no
dutdh zim on my ship i am in a
hurry now you carry on with your
search my friend and dont mind me
im going to get my anchor and pull
out

  a yell of anger shrilled up from the
lawyer in the launch carter taking
his cue from the skipper took his men
to the windlass again and the little
vessel crept up to her anchor to the tug
of her chain

  saunders looking over the quarters
on either side to see all clear noticed
that of the small fleet of flat boats he
liad been towing astern two were miss-
ing and a quick search in the darkness
failed to discover any cut or broken
ropes at the rail beauchamp joined
him anxious to know if he might help
anywhere saunders told him of the
missing boats for they were his

  i doubt if youll recover them now
ruhy we may see them as we float
down stream

  l dout care if theyre gone red
replied beauchamp in lowered tones
he peered into the shadowy glow of
the lanterns forward to make sure no
sharp police ears were too near i
saw one of em go he win tered
 our three guide took it thought
you might prefer em out of the way
yknow as this was a police visit so 

said nothing but- beauchamp

suddenly broke off and his face as-
sumed an expression of ludicrous
alarm

   say old chap he gasped what
about file old lady you sent on board
to-day 

  saunders whirled the wheel as the
anchor left the ground and the jifos
fluttered up the stays and the schooner
swung round headed for the sea again
the launch alongside half filled with
water as the schooner leaned over her
in turning and canted her gunwale until
the river poured in the lires were
extinguished and the howls of van
zoom and the stoker and boat-keeper
brought up the policemen in alarm

  carry on your search snapped
saunders to the officer who approached
him to protest better tow that launch
astern unless you want it tilled well
be into the ocean swrell in fifteen min-
utes too and your fires are out beau-
champs reminder of the old malay
hotel maid came as a shock if she
were discovered on board and per-
mitted to tell her tale it would require
no warrant to have the schooner ar-
rested and her skipper haled back to
town for kidnaping or abduction
wliichever the age of the-injured party-
warranted when he saw his sugges-
tions taking effect in the shape of an
excited consultation at the rail he
grinned aside at beauchamp and
chuckled

  id clean forgotten the old lady
ruby if these cops dont stop to find
her ill marry her to dutch zim-if
they dont ferret him out either-and
the redheads

well land em on singkep or linga for
a honeymoon that ought to please
tomking if he ever hears of it

  the schooner was speeding fast and
her forefoot had dipped into the first
swells of the sea before the policemen
arrived at a decision

  can you steer close in to the bank
captain asked the officer without
fires our launch is powerless and we
cannot risk being towed to sea if you
will drop us close to shore we can row
in and clean our fires

  hop in then smiled saunders giv-
ing the schooner a sheer with the helm
sorry you cant stop to finish your
rummage old chap whatll you tell
your employer

  ill tell him to go to the devil
snapped the officer and van zoom his
mouth full of orders complaints and
threats subsided into silence before the
policemans wrath

  the launch was cast adrift under a
steep bank overhung with lowering
trees and the black pearl drew rapidly
away the boats towing astern were
to be taken on board before the sea was
actually entered upon and the schooner
was swung across the current to check
her wajr while they were hauled in

  listen  cried carter suddenly his
hand raised there came voices from
the black shadow into which the launch
had gone

  its the policemen ragging van
zoom guessed beauchamp

  there are other voices said saun-
ders he listened intently for some
seconds and in a momentary lull of the
noises of ship and jungle tie exclaimed
its dutch zims voice for a thou-
sand  and by godfrey theres a
womans voice too chattering like a
fishwife in low malay

  then that accounts for the other
boat and we sail with a clean slate
dont we skipper

  i think perhaps wed better stay
away from palembang for a while

chuckled red and relinquished the
wheel to a seaman while he conned the
schooner through the channel of the
river mouth the open sea lay black
and bare to the north the white foam
began to curl gently at the sharp stem
and watches were set then shrill and
far-reaching from the shoreward gloom
pealed in a roaring raucous bellow 

if yer inside yuh cant be outside

if yer outside yuh cant be in-

if yer outside yuh cant be inside by a damn
    sight haw haw haw

  bringing the schooner to the wind
saunders waited for the guide he had
counted lost and cheerful as ever
unconcerned as if he had never left the
schooner tomking led his cannibals on
board giving up the boat painter to a
laughing seaman

  couldnt get hold of dutch he
grinned dont know how he got out
unless tlie old malay girl let him loose
but i saw both of them drop over the
side into a boat just before the police
launch hailed you so when you swung
about we took another boat and slipped
after them but in the darkness we
missed em and only smelled em out
when they put out again to holler to
the cops too late then let em go
ill get zim later on

  at midnight a consultation in the
saloon came to an end and the girls
retired to rest the schooner leaned
easily to a warm southerly breeze hold-
ing a course to pass just in sight of
the lights of muntok on banca island
until saunders had made a decision

  carter you may haul up to nor-
nor-west as soon as you catdh the glow
of the lights the skipper said as the
mate went on deck to begin his middle
watch when carter had gone and
only beauchamp and himself remained
launders answered the unspoken query
in rubys face

  we wont trouble singapore this
trip old fellow our treatment of
those police will assure the rats who


peoples stry magazine

are trying to gouge you out of your
rights of the unlikelihood of niy ven-
turing back to sumatra for a while
there lies our big chance dutch zim
 co will take their time now well
make the straightest course possible for
the kauipar river and beat em to it

  but i say red wont that bring
you into more trouble with the authori-
ties in the matter of your papers or
something i dont want you to get
into a mess over my affairs yknow
particularly while the girls are on
board

  saunders laughed softly and once
for all time harcourt bcauchamp cast
out any slight remaining doubt concern-
ing the resourcefulness and daring of
the genial skipper

  beauchamp you may leave the
safety of rfie girls to me any trouble
i may get into through my own actions
in this matter will touch only myself
without jess and bubbles on board i
would probably sail into the river land
the party and send the schooner off-
shore under tod carter to wait until 
signaled him to run in for us again
hes done that sort of thing before
one time he cruised just over the hori-
zon off a river settlement for two
months and never asked a question

  but because of the girls we need
him and every man of the crew there-
fore we shall take all hands even the
cook

  how queried ruby curiously

  all in good time old chap was the
smiling defense turn in now we
ought to be up to mintok soon tben
we tfiall get on a course which will
leave us free of any chance of trouble
from behind even if zims pull is
strong enough tp have us chased well
be looked for on the way to singapore
thats where we wont be	

  it was unlikely that dutch zim or
his backers or patrons would care to
enlist naval aid even if they could
command it but with dutch gunboats

and patrol vessels more or less often
departing from palembang upon their
periodical rounds of the outlying
islands it was possible that one oi
those ships might be advised to keep
an eye open for the black pearl and
with red saunders reputation lirmly
established ill sumatra any such wide
divergence from his course as called
for in his clearance papers as rhe
schooner was making would be suffi-
cient to warrant question but nothing
of phe kind happened and the schooner
for two days continued on her course
for the kampar river

  a brief squall in mid-afternoon of
the following day drove die schooner
twenty-five miles on the way before the
diminishing breeze which followed it
sank to a calm again during the iii st
fury of the squall faces which had
become anxious during the calms and
faint airs grew merry the anxiety re-
turned with the calm beauchamp was
bewildered he saw dead ahead the
dark-blue loom of the lowland through
which the river poured its greasy flood
into the malacca straits in his inno-
cence he saw nothing but a reasonably
quick and wholly satisfactory passage
to his destination he was soon to
understand much that he had been per-
mitted to puzzle his brain over

  that night the clank of pumps shud-
dered through the vessel and continued
without a break until daylight the
first warning beauchamp had that all
was not well came when the fiji stew-
ard brought him his coffee at six
oclock

  whats the noise bob he asked
the fijian

  plenty pump sar the reply was
given in a matter-of-fact tone as if a
sinking ship and pumping drill were
only incidents in a mans life ship
sinkin i tink

 what beauchamp leaped from
his bunk dragged on his clothes any-
how and screwing in his monocle
the redheads



clashed out into the saloon calling jess
and bubbles by name

  bubbles opened the door and thrust
out her head her eyes bright and mis-
chievous jess voice was heard
through the fanlight over the door ask-
ing the trouble

  by jove the bally ships sinking
dress yourselves and get on deck now
youre glad its calm arent you -
it would be much better if it were
rough or had been was the laughing
response beauchamp swore under his
breath repeated his admonition to hurry
out and dashed up the companiomvay

chapter vii

  red saunders stood on the after
house scanning the river mouth through
binoculars tod carter at the midship
rail worked without haste and seem-
ingly without concern at a great square
of canvas fitting ropes to sides and
corners between the masts a small
gang of four seamen plied the pump-
brakes with no more excitement than
they had plied their brooms on other
mornings

  yet the water gusthed in steady tor-
rents from the pump lip and poured
along the waterways to spout through
the scuppers beauchamp stared in
wonder for a moment then ran for-
ward and put the strength of his good
right arm to the pump the golden-
brown seaman whom he pushed aside
showed all his gleaming teeth in a wide
silent laugh

  no bodder sar said the man
plenty time

  plenty time by jove what sort
of people are you he turned aft and
yelled to saunders

  i say saunders dont you know the
girls are not out yet heres a fellow
who says plenty of time

  lots saunders grinned back
leave the pump ruby and dont get
excited leaping down from the

house he stepped to a rod and wheel
near the mainmast and gave the wheel
a dozen round turns then he satisfied
beauchamps amazed curiosity

  its all right old dhap i thought
a light which we sighted during the
night might be a prowling gunboat it
was a little coaster and its gone now
you see to swing off singapore and
make the river wuthout falling foul of
regulations we have to run in here in
distress

  theres nothing more distressful
than a sinking ship but with the
weather weve had it was too raw to
pull a leak big enough to sink us so i
had to keep a sharp lookout against any
possible intruders

  is that why the girls professed to
be mad over the fine weather

 nothing else you see the
schooners as tight as a bottle ruby
but ive had many occasions to use
innocent little tricks in my business and
long ago i fitted the pearl with a valve
which could be opened or closed at will
i can sink her at any time and raise
her again providing i can choose my
place and now nothing less than sink-
ing will do but well sink her on the
mud in the river as far up as we can
float after we have taken everything
out of her that water can spoil then
in six hours when we want her she
can be pumped clear and floated again

 saunders met	glance with a

iwinkling eye

  things are newer topdes kwj
theres hope in every situation right
up to the pearly gates watch the
girls particularly jess when sfaes
frightened itll be excusable m you
and bubbles is rapidly acquiring the
same philosophyas we practice look
at the crew and old tod carter hies

have it too

  so it seems and unless i oinking
and his cannibals are keen actors or
fatalists theyre learning

  beauchamp joined the girls aft and
submitted to a round of merry chaffing
over his early morning alarm after
breakfast was over the fijian set to
work packing up the cabin furnishings
in water-tight cases and jess suggested
that beauchamp gather his baggage
ready to go ashore on deck as the
schooner sw am slowly into the six-mile-
wide mouth of the kampar the crew
were busy striking out from the hold
all the freight and stores of beau-
champs outfit two men with carter
rigged the tackles for hoisting out the
boats amidships griped down to
chocks with slip gripes a long light
steel lifeboat sat fitted with all the
necessary gear beauchamps own flat
boats were light enough to be dropped
over by hand

  the pumps were not going the valve
was closed but sufficient water had
been admitted into the bilges to bring
the schooners waterline down notice-
ably that was in case of the sudden
appearance of unwelcome craft saun-
ders divided his attention between run-
ning his ship in and watching the occa-
sional distant brown specks which
marked native craft entering or leaving
the kampar when he river and rear-
ward sea lay clear of specks or smoke
the skipper leaped into alert life

  swing out the steel boat carter i
he ordered take out the light tow-
line and put a double crew to work

spell and jell at llte oars tides run-
ning up now we can make time

   with the schooner sailing on and the
powerful boat towing ahead with the
tide rather more than counteracting the
river current before noon the head of
navigation was in sight on either side
the land sloped easily inland covered
with dense wood and jungle the river
banks thrust thtrir verdure sheer into
the water on both sides of a narrow
channel wide mud ats lay yellow under
the vertical sun saunders picked out
a piece of bankside higher and less
steamy than tlie rest and abreast of
this the anchor was let go

  with tomking and his battak lend-
ing invaluable aid ashore in clearing a
space for storage the schooner was
quickly emptied of everything mov-
able or destructible in water then
her sails were unbent and parceled in
tarpaulin and when all had been taken
ashore saunders himself slacked the
cable permitting die schooner to drop
into -deeper water then opened the sea
valve wide

  from the leafy screen behind which
the crew were building stores in the
native style they watched the black
pearls modi- funeral slowly she sank
lower and lower slowly she listed over
to stariboard deeper and deeper as if
she must roll over then so real that
even jess who had seen the trick
played before gasped involuntarily the
schooner bubbled and sank into tlie
muddy bed until only her masts and
one side of her bulwarks were visible

  but arent you afraid that fhe
natives about here will chop off your
masts or something beau champ
asked not yet entirely aible to accept
everything he saw without question

   i wont be when we leave was the

smiling reply

  the crew still divided into their
separate watches but all working com-
pleted the preparations for leaving
while the party ate dinner one watch


the redheads



cut masses of tree branches great ferns
and trusses of long wiry grass these
were floated out and securely fastened
to every visible part of the vessel until
she resembled at a hundred yards dis-
tance a semidetached piece of fore-
shore that had slipped into the river
back in the thick jungle the other party
worked with tomking and his battaks
to cover up all traces of the cache
where lay the schooners gear and spare
stores and when near sundown the
boats shoved off to make a short jour-
ney upriver to eradicate the last trace
of recent human arrival at the hidden
depot the keenest eye was unable to
say with certainty which bit of tangled
shore wras the black pearl

  in this order the party started in
the lead went tomking carter and
two of the crew in a flat boat with
emergency rations and water for two
days they traveled ligfat in order
that their mobility and handiness might
be preserved they were the scouts
next came the steel lifeboat with jess
and bubbles saunders beauchamp
and four oarsmen in the steel boat
was the bulk of the traveling stores
in the other three flat boats were the
two battaks the remaining five seamen
and the steward and the rest of the
stores and equipment and each mem-
ber of the party was armed according
to his or her taste

  in the brief twilight of the equator
the river rolled vague and mysterious
darkness fell like the dropping of a
curtain camp was made by torchlight
and lantern but in the short journey
they had made since leaving the
chooner rulby beauchamp had experi-
enced yet another thrill

  he had felt a little bit uneasy on tihe
voyage from palemlbang on the girls
account he knew little of jungle life
and nothing whatever of the country he
was going to except that it was wild
and all bjt untrodden when the
schooner sank gurgling into the mud

he gazed reflectively at the long-cloaked
figures of jess and bubbles and almost
regretted their presence for the first
time he realized that such a journey
with its possibilities of trouble other
than the obstacles of nature was not
exactly on the picnic order but on
stepping into the boat he had changed
his mind slightly

  the girls had equipped themselves
for the trip with all the cunning of old
trailers beneath their long rainproof
cloaks they wore tunics and short skirts
of stout khaki cloth leather puttees
and stout boots with a hint of sensible
corduroy knickers showed their full
knowledge of the conditions ahead
and at the leather belt of each hung a
holster out of which peeped the butt
of a pistol lacking all ornamentation a
real gun in fact

  now while camp was being pitched
and the fijian was busy opening his
packages jess and bubbles received the
firewood and stones brought in by the
men and set to work to huild a camp
fire of ndble size and cunning arrange-
ment and when the fire was ready
it was the girls who cooked the supper
not as girls usually do in make-believe
camp burning the food smoking the
water and roasting and smudging their
pretty faces but expertly cleanly and
well themselves joining in the circle as
hungry as any and as cool and un-
ruffled

  a gray dawn start saw the boats fifty
miles on the way by the following noon
and when the dinner halt was made on
a sand flat in midstream the village of
pulu lawan was in sight on the north-
ern bank at the next bend here addi-
tional laborers were to be recruited and
saunders took tomking and beauchamp
forward to see what could be had

  when the boats arrived an hour later
a gang of sturdy malays awaited them
on the shore saunders had secured
thirty men and with them were grouped
a few women and some fat babies while


peoples story magazine

behind the group making a harrangue
in excited tones a portly chinaman
shook his fist at the white men in un-
celestial wrath something that the
chinaman shrieked caused a stir of un-
easiness among the laborers saunders
swiftly stopped the spread of it by pro-
ducing a bag of cash and distributing
wages in advance to the men

  on the bank lay a pile of native food-
stuffs made up into packs of individual
man capacity calling one of the bat-
taks and three of his own men from
the boats the skipper marshaled the
gang under their supervision and he
saw the gang march away upriver
laden with their packs and guarded by
his dependable gilbert islanders at the
heds of the achin cannibal then he
reenvljarked and the boats proceeded
none of the party evinced any desire
to improve their knowledge of pulu
lawan a mile away upriver the reek
of the squalid settlement followed them

  the river was now shallow enough
for poling and the flat boats made
faster progress but every mile traversed
increased the difficulty of navigating the
steel lifeboat

  where docs your land begin beau-
champ saunders asked after thirty
minutes had been lost hauling the steel
boat out of the sucking mud

  about fifty miles upriver from pulu
lawan the river forks the main
stream runs down from the hills due
east from mount ophir and the tribu-
tary comes in from the foothills of
merapi my land is all that section in-
closed by the two streams and bounded
by the jungle fringe at the hills

  huh a fine voyage for a sailor
grunted saunders its forty miles
farther to the nearest yard of your land
and the boat barely floats now

  better quit the river and march
queried beauchamp

  good lud man itll take days
besides if your domain is surrounded
by water we need boats unless wrere to

develop web feet packing our stuff
across and  want the steel boat along
if it s at all possible its fitted up to
my own ideas ruby its not only a
boat but at times its served as a darned
good fort and its packed with enough
emergency stores to last all the people
it will hold for a week

  then whats to be done i confess
im stumped

  dam the river

  with all my heart laughed beau-
champ damn it or cuss it in any old
way

  oh not that kind of damn grinned
saunders dam it with trees stones
and mud and stuff then perhaps we
can float up to your front garden old
chap

  after another hour of rowing pol-
ing and hauling from the banks the
steel boat reached an impassable stretch
of steaming festering mud flatb through
which the narrowest of ribbons of yel-
low current trickled on either bank
lay the dense gloomy jungle noisy with
bird life fetid with the fetor of rotting
vegetation over the mass of almost
blue-black foliage of the forest the
slender brown stalks and spreading
green heads of sago and coconut palms
rose in isolated groves near the river

  down upon all poured the midsummer
sun vertically overhead at noon never
seeming to moderate its fierce heat from
the moment of rising out of the cool
east to its sinking beyond the western
heat-haze a bilious glare reflected
from the yellow mud shimmered and
wavered with the foul vapors of mi-
asma

  sooner we get past here the better
stated saunders tersely after a scrutiny
of the whole scene here tomking
can you call that cannibal of yours
that jungle looks as if the marching
party must be ten miles away at least

  for answer tomking called the other
battak and together they vanished m
the bush to speedily reappear climbing
the redheads



the smooth stem of the tallest palm
when they emerged out of the top of
the mass of branches they cupped their
hands and in chorus sent a shrill bell-
clear yell echoing away over the forest

  for two minutes they remained mo-
tionless each with a hand behind his
right ear then they descended and re-
appeared at the river bank

  i heard em reported tomking
simply theyll get here in an hour
what dyou want done first

  palms trunk and head rocks mud
grass bush anything in the shape of
vines or creepers for rope all hands
will turn to carter serve out the tools
beauchamp come with me and help the
girls make camp we wont get away
from here this evening however we
work

  when the sun touched the western
forest rim fifty tall palms lay in a pile
beside the river their heavy heads
lopped off the camp nestled in the
clearing made by cutting the trees and
jungle grasses just far enough from
the river to be free of the muddy odors
from it the heat was terrific the
mosquitoes and other stinging insects
legion for all the white mans discom-
forts before sundown there marched
out of the jungle a cheerful army of
laborers each man carrying a pack and
his tools each woman carrying cooking
utensils at least a few carried also
each a fat laughing baby slung in a
shawl at her hip if they knew it the
fact that they followed a cannibal
achinese seemed to trouble them not a
bit the fattest of the fat babies gurgled
and sucked a fat thumb when the bat-
tak brushed past to report to tomking

chapter viii

  before the sun had climbed to the
zenith on the following day a strong
barrier stretched across the river from
bank to bank it had been regularly
built of long palm stems interwoven

with tough grasses and bush lashed and
cross-lashed with vines and creeper
stalks then the boats were emptied
the baggage and otlier material portaged
beyond the flats and the big steel boat
hauled over the greazy ooze by men
walking alongside on mudshoes fash-
ioned from the wide strong leaves of
the double coconut the flatboats
floated by when emptied with one man
in each then the last boat from the
upstream side of the dam towed the
end of it across and fastened it to the
farther shore the afternoon was occu-
pied in plastering the barrier with sev-
eral tons of claylike mud and stones
then the boats aground on the shore
were loaded and it remained only to
wait until the rising river should permit
them to proceed

  if it would only rain grumbled
saunders irked at the forced inaction
ill bet as soon as we get up there and
want a spell of dry weather itll pour
down on us in sheets

  beauchamp and carter tried the boats
every fifteen minutes or so until dark-
ness fell but the slow-running river
rose all but imperceptibly

  its another night in camp for us
remarked carter looking disgustedly
upon the turbid expanse them flying
boats are what we want up here
why dont you come in to supper
cried bubbles coming upon them in the
midst of their disgusted comment
dont you -know that a watched pot
never boils

  thanks for the lesson smiled beau-
champ with a bow this is rapid ad-
vancement in learning indeed

  they joined the circle about the- ian-
tern-lighted spread at alittle distance
hummed and chattered the laborers
camp the squalling of a baby made
fretful by the mosquitoes added a
human note to the monkeylike hubbub
any improvement asked saunders
the bally river hasnt risen more
than an inch replied ruby tomking
peoples story magazine

   stood just outside the lighted circle his
own supper finished with the air of a
white man long thrown among natives
who longs yet hesitates to rejoin his
own kind his attire perhaps intensified
his shyness for even the presence of
the girls had not made him resume the
uncomfortable gear of the white man
when beauchamp uttered his discour-
aging report tomking stepped forward
his supremely ugly face lighted almost
to good looks by the life in his expres-
sive eyes

  the river rises quicker in the early
morning he volunteered theres a
nightly rain in the mountains it never
fails

  there had been an element of mystery
about tomking ever since the first day
of their acquaintance and his hint that
he would some time tell of his experi-
ences with dutch zim had not been
forgotten by saunders in pulu lawan
too tomking had known exactly where
and how to secure laborers and had
actually taken them away from their
employer the gross chinaman who had
harangued them unsuccessfully against
the voiceof the skippers cash

  sit down and smoke a cheroot the
skippei-said edging aside to make room
between himself and beauchamp the
man hesitated still until jess smiled
brightly up at him and added her invita-
tion 

  dont feel shy with us tomking
we dont bother about the fashions in
camp if its your clothes youre worry-
ing about

  then you think we can start again
at daylight suggested saunders

  soon after anyway

   and carry good water right up to
the fork of the streams

  yes unless somebody back here
busts up the dam on us

  i dont anticipate that who would
be likely to do it and why

  well you saw the fat chink in pulu

lawan didnt he try to stop you hiring
labor  he knew me too hes one of
the small fry of tlie crooks firm of van

zoom kempees dutch zim  co
lonuving spoke with animation puf-
fing furiously at his strong cheroot
when he named dutch zim his usualh
attractive eyes glared redly and saun-
ders prompted him

   but how is it that dutch zim is so
strong about here hes only a com-
mon beach comber isnt he dyou
know much about him

   hes the dirty-work end of the shark
firm and mister beauchamps got hold
of a bit  land which is worth a lot o
money he got his title before the fat
chinaman at pulu lawan sent down
word that there was oil and gold be-
sides rubber to be had for the getting
youll see plenty o sport if your ideas
of sport include running oit or being
run off by a lot o bad malays at the
heels of a rotten bad white

  that need not worry us tomking
i think we can match wits and strength
against dutch zim but what i want
to know is how far down his backing
goes is he just a crooked arm of a
crooked body or is the whole official
outfit of palembang in on a gigantic
graft i cant credit that

  tomking laughed unpleasantly

   its truer than youd think possible
dutch zim more than once got soldiers
lent him to pull his burnt chestnuts out
of the ashes and the time  got left
behind among the battak cannibals it
was while i was working for him
theres gold up there in achin too
he never trusted himself along with
that man-eating crew not him but he
had enough pull to get a body of troops
sent up to escort his loot out and
enough damned crookedness-pardon
me ladies-to make the soldiers leave
me in the claws of the battak priests
he couldnt do that unless the officer
was willing could he and my notion
of the dutch srmy and navy officers is
the redheads

that theyre straight and clean ji come
from higher up did that order

  havent you any idea who it is
beauchamp put in

  sure i got an idea and itll hit pretty
close when the target score s counted
returned tomking fiercely its a
woman if it aint you can ship me
back to the cannibals again

  tod carter got up and strolled down
to the river he was never very much
interested when the talk swung around
to women for that reason saunders
had ever found him a safe custodian of
secrets when their mutual business
brought them in contact with the fairer
frailer sex saunders watched his
grizzled mate depart with a quiet smile
irhich intensified in his eyes only when
ihe met jess wise glance and saw the
almost imperceptible little nod of her
iiead

  a woman hey  he echoed not car-
ing to risk curtailing tomkings opinions
by casting a palpable verbal bait

  yes a woman a woman that can
took like a lady talk like a siren and
act like a devil tomking glanced ap-
prehensively toward the girls jess sat
beside saunders quietly attentive evinc-
ing no fear concerning what might
transpire in his tale bubbles was
curled up kittenlike with her shoul-
der resting apparently unconsciously
against beauchamp her dark eyes glow-
ing with interest the skipper noticed
the mans pause and smiled at him

  go on he said ill tell you when
to stop

  shes got the nerve of old nick the
looks of a houri the wealth of sheba
and the conscience of a she-gorilla
tomking went on that time the mili-
tary expedition went into achin to settle
an uprising of the battaks and come
out with the backs whipped off their
clothes she was waiting down in medan
for the officer in command to send her
down her share of the dust theyd
swiped from the native gold washers

  bpeo

he didnt send it he brought it him-
self and left his men in the middle of
a hot lot of sharp-toothed sports while
he panjandered with her in the town
i heard after that he demanded pay-
ment as she had promised him she
laughed in his face reported him to his
chief as having insulted her and he
blew out his brains-if ever he had any
-while the chief took her off on a
whirl over to batavia

  jess smiled up at the skipper her
expression hinting that she believed
tomking to be giving rein to a vivid
imagination saunders winked at her
cautioning silence

  gracious cried bubbles unaware
of that hint why my dear man it
sounds just like a tale out of drops
from a bloody kris or some such
shocker

  cant help that lady grinned tom-
king nowise angry at being doubted
only time can prove whether that yarn
is true or not main thing is for us
that i know youre going up against
something stronger than dutch zim
when alls done youll be quite ready
to leave that small-time snake to me

  tod carter appeared in the circle
again and his face was dark with sus-
picion

  cant make it out skipper he said
the blame river seems to be falling
instead of rising

  the men got up quickly and stepped
down to the bank it required only a
single glance at the boats to realize that
unless they had been hauled farther up
the water had left them a full tiiree
inches the moon still lingered below
the eastern horizon the long line of the
dam stretched into invisibility at mid-
stream but to attentive ears there
came the gurgle and murmur of run-
ning water out there in the blackness

  tomking spoke three short words in
the battak tongue and two soft splashes
followed immediately at the river shore
far over toward the other hank there
peoples story magazine

sounded a curious elusive creaking and
shrilling not to be identified with any of
the jungle noises of the night  hen
with staggering sharpness two human
yells pealed out as one to be cut short
midway

  saunders and beauchamp peered into
the black shadows and the grim joyless
chuckle of tomking tingled in their ears
silently the two girls had joined them
at the river and tomking chuckle
ceased as abruptly as had those penetrat-
ing veils then the dam creaked and
swayed near by and out of the gloom
two figures leajied advanced to tom-
king spoke one word each and cast two
objects at his feet which fell with dull
reboundless thuds

  the battaks vanished again to their
own camp but tomking fear in his
eyes for the first time glared around at
saunders and the others hurriedly
picked up what the battaks had cast
down and plunged into the jungle like
a great cat saunders went after him
and overtook him as he hurled one of
the objects far into the thicket

  what is it the skipper demanded
staying the others arm as he raised it
for another throw

  tomking shrugged his bare shoulders
ami held out his missile the skipper
touched it and drew back with a curse
of unpleasant surprise

  a bloody head he swore in dis-
gust what does this mean

  it means said tomking simply
that dutch zims fat chinaman has
started work i sent the battaks over
to see where the water was getting
through the dam there had to be a
narrow opening to let the whole river
through in such a close stream as to tear
a channel in the mud they brought
me two heads for an answer now we
have to mend the dam and wait a bit
longer

  call all hands saunders ordered
pitch that thing after the other and
dont let the women hear of this well

get to work right away and leave a
couple of men behind to watch the ends
of the dam this time

  but mind he admonished no more
head-lopping until  give the word im
not in the butchering business

chapter ix

  the dam was repaired and a watch
vet the water began to rise rapidly just
before dawn and one by one tlie boats
floated two days passed in arduous
negotiation of flats and narrow chan-
nels then the river forks came in sight

-	the beginning of ruby beauchamps
disputed domain

  the marching laborers were already
waiting on the farther bank of the river
under the command of tomking and
tod carter who had taken charge in
anticipation of further possible trouble
carter had nothing to report however
the march had been marked by nothing
more than the difficulties of the virgin
jungle

  ilere you are beauchamp re-
marked saunders waving a hand over
the pile of goods on the point of land
between the forks your gear is on
the spot all sound dry and bristol-
fashion where next

  better make a base camp here he
said after a period of deep thought in
which his gaze had flitted concernedly
toward the girls this will need talk-
ing over saunders by the look of
things we ought to have come in across
the mountains from the westward i
dont see how we are going to get any-
thing out of here by river do you

   cross bridges when you get to em
advised the skipper shortly didnt
come all this way to quit cold did you

  beauchamp flushed and again his
gaze wandered to the girls saunders
noticed it now

   i didnt mean to say that ruby he
said quietly and f see your point
but let me put you right now and it
the redheads



goes for all time jess and her chum
came with us knowing quite well that
they were not starting on a picnic
theyll stick as tight as any of the men
now lets get to work not to talk

  rubber trees grew thickly in the near
forest and scouts sent out returned with
the report that they extended far be-
yond two hours march the jungle
became less tangled as the land rose
nd following the left branch of the
river fork there was a stretch of several
miles of bare rocky-sprinkled levels
the last scout to come in one of the
battaks whose vision had been proved
to rival the eagles told of having
combed a palm on the crest of a rise
and seen the crest of ophir in the glare
of the setting sun

  thats impossible of course saun-
ders decided but if he only saw the
loom of the main range of mountains it
shows that were not so far from open
country well make an early start to-
morrow ruby leaving a base here and
try to reach some spot where we can
find water and from which we can send
out prospecting parties into the thicker
country

  we ought first to get up to the west-
ern boundary of the tract said beau-
champ thoughtfully you see the
rivers are natural and sufficient bound-
aries on two sides but the western line
is simply the jungle fringe at the foot-
hills it curves in a wide arc the ends
are much farther west than the middle
and we might easily lose the best bit of
the lot by having the two horns cut off
assuming that there is gold in any quan-
tity at the head of these streams

 how might that decapitation be
done  jess wanted to know saunders
looked his opinion also smilingly un-
believing

  why couldnt somebody cut back
the jungle fringe as easily as we shall
have to cut our way there  answered
beauchamp

  bridges again smiled the skipper

bridges like chickens old chap cross
or count neither prematurely i under-
stand your land goes to the junction of
river and jungle and that means as
nature planted it in my opinion any-
way thats the opinion well back against
all comers with your permission

  that night the boats were hauled out
of the water and covered over with
weather-resisting thatches of broad
leaves the big steel lifeboat was set
up on wooden cradles near the point of
the land covered as were the rest but
with a tight wooden cover of board sec-
tions under the thatch and rollers lay
 planks beneath it wide and light
ready at five minutes notice to carry the
craft down to waters edge in the boat
was a full equipment of oars sails arms
and stores at a pinch it could carry
thirty mefi and there were emergency
rations for that number when
thatched however the lifeboat was left
as invisible as the flat boats

  it was midnight before the half moon
rose that night but it peeped down on
wakeful figures as well as the prone
forms of the sleepers the swift falling
of the river was what made tomking
incapable of sleeping for he knew what
it meant it told its story as clearly as
spoken words a story of murdered bar-
rier guards and a thoroughly bursted
dam by moonrise the river beds lay
revealed to one third the width of the
streams and- the ribbons of water
trickled noisily amid the boulders
carter could not sleep for thinking of
the unsailorly predicament his skipper
had landed them in at last bred on
the oceans knowing little of the dry
earth and caring less tod carter would
follow red saunders right up to the
doors of perdition without comment 
but his sailorly instincts gagged at the
idea of that fine steel lifeboat a veritable
floating stronghold on which he and the
skipper had lavished the thought of
years stuck under a thatch like a coolie
hut and doomed to rust away there for

want of water to float her back to her
proper element

chapter x

  twentv miles of progress occupied
the party a tull week

  then at the end of the week when a
sunday rest va decided advisable and
camp was pitched in a grassy glade
among forest growth so sparse that it
indicated a near approach to the jungle
fringe tomking appeared with his
scouts an brought the first certain
proofs of other greatly hoped for
treasures

  a battak produced from his loin cloth
a calabash and gave it to beauchamp
the other achinese untied a corner of
his garment and dribbled a spoonful of
glittering particles into red saunders
hand beauchamp unstoppered the
calabash and his aristocratic nose
wrinkled

  jove he gasped holding the cala-
bash at arms length and frowning
across it at saunders who stood laugh-
ing at him what have you tapped
tomking-a tomb

  thats petroleum you ass grinned
the skipper turn it out into a dish
lets see it

  the oleaginous mess was poured out
a half-pint of yellowish-brown evilly
smelling crude oil beside it was laid
the little heap of gold dust and for a
moment no one spoke here at last was
tangible evidence of wealth waiting to
be taken from the earth far in excess
of anything to be tapped from the rub-
ber trees in the forest if the samples
were fair and the bringing in of those
small parcels of oil and gold dust gave
a good test of the individual characters
of the people in the party

  beaucliamp to whom it all belonged
samples and whatever might follow
smiled happily at everybody around him
and dropped his monocle

i say people im awfully glad he

said earnestly you wont lose in
profits at least by your sportin action in
helpin me out

   dont start in giving awa fori tines
at first sight of color saunders
laughed but im glad to see the tuif
t o ruby you have something worth
lighting for anyhow

  yes gents and believe me youll
have to fight for it or im a bimlycrow
romking interjected savagely

  oh perhaps you fancy that smiled
jess stirring the glittering dust with her
pink forefinger idly dont lets an-
ticipate trouble tod carter stood be-
hind the skipper and except for a ileet-
ing glance of contempt flung at the piti-
ful little display made by the samples
evinced no interest in riches or the pros-
pect of having to fight for them truth
was the grizzled old sea-dog had almost
expected to find oil already barreled
gold tumbling out of the rocks in minted
coin and rubber growing in balls on the
trees like coconuts or calabashes at
jess advice he nodded his shaggy head

  thats right he grumbled lets
wait till we get something worth scrap-
pin for before we get scared of some-
body else buttin in to rob us of it
tomking grinned pityingly at him

  miss jess i dont fancy things he
said leastways not this sort o thing
that oil came from a patch of saturated
ground more than a mile square its
just a swamp of grease worth big money
per yard the dust came out of a
pocket in a little brook that runs into
the river out of a hole in the rock and
by all the signs theres a bullock-load of
it for the seeking

  and its never happened at least in
my time that any bit o ground one half
as rich as this looks is let go out of the
hands of the bunch o pirates ive told
you about yroull see mister beau-
champ that there was method behind
kempees  van zoom making out your
title to be faulty

  tomking spoke with more intensity
the redheads

and less of bush jargon than at any
lime since he had joined the party and
his reminder had the effect of damping
some of the enthusiasm which his dis-
coveries had evoked he went off with
his battaks while supper was being pre-
pared and did not reappear until after
the camp had gone to sleep hours after-
ward

  saunders was absent from breakfast
on sunday morning and nobody seemed
to know where he had gone the
watchman one of the schooners crew
had seen him about midnight after the
others had gone to their blankets and
he had sent him the watchman to take
a look at the state of the river with an
order to do so every hour

  as the party were about to clear away
the remnants of the morning meal the
skipper emerged from the jungle and
jess glanced up at his face a little
shiver rippled through her for he wore
the smile that warned of trouble he
called beauchamp and carter aside and
in the recesses of a wild banana patch
swung around on them

  tomking was right lie said
youll have to fight for your own
beauchamp theres a bunch of men
lopping bushes at this moment right on
your boundary and the boss of the job
is an officer unless hes camouflaged

  then the only thing to do is to get
there and stop em at once beauchamp
retorted warmly by jove old fellow
we cant let the bounders-

  thats all i wanted to know saun-
ders interrupted him we start at
once i suppose youll go the limit to
protect your title wont you

  er-what is your idea of a limit
he inquired with a reminiscent grin
i remember that you referred to our
little defiance of the police in the river
as merely a joke

  it was a joke retorted saunders
impatiently that was as much of a
joke as making dutch zim disgorge the
purse for the fight this will lie no

joke unless you let em make it one on
us if youre serious about defending
your rights there must be no hesitation
when it comes to a show-down my way
would be to sail in and run the pirates
off the lot with lead before they get a
footing your way may be different

  thats the only way mister tod
carter put in sharply

  beauchamp laughed

  that is surely the limit saunders
im willing to go as far as shooting to
defend my property of course but it
seems to me that your plan is attacking
not defending suppose we see what
theyre up to and who they are first
what 

  i know who they are returned the
skipper you know it too if dutch
zim isnt there himself he isnt far
away ill gamble on it but its your
affair beauchamp go ahead on any
line you like well back you and if
you find that youre up against some-
thing too deep for your beautiful faith
in human nature just tip me the word
and ill take charge only for the love
of jupiter lets move

  the camp was broken up and the
entire par-ty with all their stores and
material took the trail westward there
was no need any longer to send out side
parties the objective lay ahead and
saunders leading with tomking and
two of his tried gilbert islanders set a
pace which permitted no loitering the
girls accustomed as they were to rough-
ing it were taxed to keep with the
leaders progress slowed as the ground
rose higher and when the edge of the
jungle was reached even saunders the
iron man welcomed the brief halt be-
fore emerging upon the open

  well make our base right here on
the stream decided beauchamp after a
scrutiny of the foothills beyond this
is the natural fringe of the jungle isnt
it

  youd better run your boundary line
across saunders replied
peoples story magazine

  best thing we can do if you want
me to suggest is to mark your boundary
here and leave the camp in charge of
carter and a few men to look after
things then tell off six of my crew who
are all fitted with brains to follow
along the fringe and plant marks as they
come they can overtake us well
hike right out to the other end establish
your line and run it back to meet our
men then on that part where the
bush has been cleared youll station
guards with rifles keep a sort of
armed peace if you like but let nobody
across that line until youve examined
into their business

   i dont see any other way replied
beauchamp

  leaving the new camp under a ca-
pable guard saunders and beauchamp
took two men and cut across the bare
rockv rises of the hills this route had
the advantage of height from which
before twilight set in a considerable
draggling party of men could be seen
about the middle of the distance be-
tween rivers

  it was dark when the little band of
legal occupiers reached the headwaters
of the kampar and prepared to check-
mate the would-be usurpers by the
light of torches a cairn of stones was
set up and others at hundred-yard inter-
vals were placed along the fringe until
there was a station for each of the four
men of the party

   lets eat now suggested saunders
flinging down his haversack and
beauchamp this is where you simply
have to decide to go the limit youll
have a single-handed watch at one of
the cairns i shall have another and the
two men likewise theres no support
for you except a moral one youll
discover that youre dealing with men
who are very prone to shoot before chal-
lenging and youd better act accord-
ingly these fellows who are moving
your lines are doing it knowing that
theyre on a crooked game and your

life doesnt count sleep light dont let
go of your gun and dont back a yard
behind your lawful line

  it was clear daylight when saunders

was awakened by the crunch of feet
and the chatter of voices he started
to his feet ready for anything but with
a feeling of curiosity as to the identity
of the leader of that land-grabbing ex-
pedition predominant in his mind he
looked around upon the faces of at least
sixty men of every type and almost
every race

  his eyes wept over the main body
leisurely before he lowered them to look
into the face of the actual leader

  good morning he said civilly
can i do anything for yon

 t he leader a man of medium size and
of no particular distinction of features
was dressed in a military uniform and
armed with a pair of luger automatic
pistols and a short heavy knife similar
to the ghurka kukri he stared inso-
lently up at the cool skipper twisting a
tiny point of mustache with thumb and
forefinger of his left hand saunders
met his stare with a bland smile the
man frowned darkly

  do for me he echoed the skippers
words with a drawl you can take
yourself out of my way and if you
piled those stones here you may remove
them quickly

  see here little man said saunders
in a coldly savage tone i dont know
you from jim crow but i do know
that the owner of this land has put me
here on guard and  ii pick to pieces the
robber who steps over the line

  one of the vacant-faced bush-cutters
uttered acackle in keeping with his ex-
pression and more than one of the more
intelligent faces wore a sly grin for
the officer stood fuming with rage be-
fore the big red-headed man who defied
him unable to force his tongue to
speech and swinging along gun in
hand fifty yards away came ruby beau-
champ his head bare and his glorious
the redheads



  thatch of vivid hair glinting in the sun
  to outrival the gleaming- curls of saun-
  ders

chapter xi

    good morning sir and what can i
 dt for you smiled beauchamp uncon-
 sciously repeating the exact salutation of
 saunders

    the officer stared in ludicrous amaze-
  ment at the newcomer and his eyes
  flitted from one to the other of those
  redheads he seemed to be suddenly-
  shorn of his garb of insolent authority
  then some of his own men grinned aud-
  ibly and the situation was in danger of
  lapsing into comedy he straightened
  up abruptly and his face darkened

    i have already told this fellow-

say saunders commanded red

   saunders then i have told saun-
 ders i require him to take down these
 stones and get off the ground i am
 running a line for the government and
 you are trespassing and i shall run you
 off

   listen- saunders waited anx-
 iously for beauchamps decision hoping
 yet almost fearing listen said
 ruby i have title to this land your
 men are destroying my property by cut-
 ting down bushes which  prefer to have
 remain when you can show me au-
 thority superior to that which awarded
 me my right to this tract of land i shall

-	withdraw until that time since you
 choose to play that game you will cross
 this line and enter my territory at your
 own risk 

    with a snarling yell the self-styled
  officer dragged a pistol from the holster
  leaped forward and overturned reds
  pile of stones with his foot calling to
  his men to set upon the defiant red-
  heads a few of his followers made
  uncertain moves but most of them hung
  back grinning

   ruby beauchamp leveled his own
 weapon coolly leisurely as if shooting

at a target and shot at the mans pistol-
hand the gun dropped with a clank
on the stones and as the men swarmed
around and the humiliated officer leaped
up with his murderous knife in hand a
ringing deep-sea hail came down the
wind and the two gilbert islanders
bounded toward the spot from their
distant posts

  as their hail echoed through the
awakening forest it was answered with
redoubled volume from farther down
the line and now the line runners hav-
ing marched all night leaped into view
emerging from the jungle and speeding
over the bare earth like great brown
shining deer

  with a whoop of joy they swept
around their revered skipper like a
brown ghost one of them seemed to
wrap himself about the screaming offi-
cer taking away his knife as easily as
he might have taken a stick from a will-
ful child and the half hundred men
who had started forward stopped

  saunders released the leader from the
grip of the sailor and turned his face
toward the hills

  pick up your luger mister he
said kicking it toward the man
gather your men and forward march
you started this and i guess you know
what to expect if you want to start
something again dont wait to say
good-by

  the crowd of nondescripts began
marching up the slopes without waiting
for their discomfited leadfer he fol-
lowed them foi twenty yards then
turned shook his fist at the grinning
authors of his defeat and yelled shrilly

  i know you red saunders youre
laughing now but wait youll get your
medicine yet like the bloody pirate you
are the police want you now in
palembang

  saunders roared with merriment he
picked up a rock as big as a babys head
hurled it with the precision of a bullet
and the man went down with a grunt
 

under the impact of five pounds of soft
limestone in the stomach

   tomking appeared suddenly from the
jungle with the battaks

   i thought so he remarked they
dont have that kind for officers in the
dutch service

  who is he demanded beauchamp

  one of kempees  van zooms
tools hes done time on the roads and
harbor works chained to others like him
thats all the work he ever did for the
government those law sharks have a
plenty of such birds keep em to do
dirty jobs in return for keeping em out
of jail again

   leaving three of the black pearls
seamen with kohl to maintain occu-
pancy at the northern end of the terri-
tory the party started on the return
march to the other end an hour of
prospecting under tomkings shrewd
guidance revealed enough traces of free
gold in the pockets of the stream to
promise a profit and on these the men
went to work then on the route back
urged by the suspicion that the invading
party knew something an exhaustive
examination was carried out bringing
to light several tracts of outcropping
rock which undoubtedly held precious
metal whether in paying quantity or not
could only be decided on still more
minute inspection

  the return journey with its many
halts and side trips took up three days
then the river camp came in sight
with the quarters of the thirty laborers
and their dependents ranged semi-
circularly in the jungle fringe about it
at sight of the white tent of the girls
red eyes lighted up softly and even
beauchamp felt as if he were coming
home neither man uttered his
thoughts though both experienced a
little disappointment at the complete
silence surrounding the tent in the
bush the malays chattered their women
laughed shrilly their fat babies howled
or gurgled their dogs whined without

  people s story magazine

barking but at the tent was neither
welcoming song cheery hand wave or
sight of a khaki dress

  here joey saunders called to one
of his sailors who was industriously
washing clothes before the tarpaulined
heap of equipment the man looked up
then came smiling broadly

  where are the missies

  oh dey take little walk sar
grinned the man misser carter he go
too up dere pointing toward the
crevice from which lhe source of the
river trickled musically saunders and
his ruby comrade felt as if relieved of
a tremendous load with the dour old
mate the girls were safe then the man
added an item which put another aspect
on the case

  lady walk down dis mornin sar
she very fine lady ho vis dey go
long wid her misser carter laff lak
anyting

  all right joey get us some grub
as quickly as you can then take ten
of the malays and pack up stores for
half a dozen men for a week and stand
by to take them down the line

  while they ate their dinner beau-
champ and saunders made conjectures
regarding the strange woman neither
noticed that tomking leaving his re-
maining cannibal comrade behind had
sneaked up the hills and out of sight
conjecture seeming idle they discussed
matters of equipment until the stores
party had departed

  finally both men felt a little impa-
tient if not uneasy regarding the
lengthy absence of the girls only
carters being with them prevented a
journey in search of them

  here they come cried beauchamp
at last the shadows were stretching
out and the hill crests were hazy with
the refraction of the sinking sunlight
carter led the single-file column of four
jaunty and bright of eye then jess
and bubbles with last of all the strange
woman beauchamp and saunders
the redheads



gazed intently at the stranger feeling
more than a little distrustful of any
woman who would venture alone into
such a country but apparently they
discovered nothing in the woman at a
distance anyway to warrant their dis-
trust

  by jove shes a howlin beauty
cried ruby dropping liis monocle to
polish the lens saunders laughed good-
humoredly

  dont let - first impressions take
charge of you old hoss besides look
at bubbles

  beauchamp transferred his gaze with
a little guilty start at sight of bubbles
he realized that he had been staring
rudely at the stranger and ignoring her
and jess altogether bubbles was look-
ing straight at him her lovely face regis-
tering disdain she merely nodded as
she passed him and went to the tent
jess followed her after greeting the
men excusing herself with the plea that
all three women needed to freshen up a
bit after the hot days walk but before
she opened the flap which bubbles had
dropped to permit the other woman to
enter she introduced her

  this is mrs rubens-mrs rubens
captain saunders and mr beauchamp
mrs rubens is exploring the hills for
fossils smiled jess as she waited for
the woman to offer a hand to each of
the men and follow her inside the tent

  when the women had gone beau-
champ looked quizzically at the skipper
receiving a grin and a nod of invitation
in reply he followed him down to the
edge of the stream

  did you see her eyes red asked

  saw nothing else jove they go
right through you did she speak

  saunders laughed outright

  x thought you wouldnt know
whether she opened her lips or not
man you were staring into her face as
if your were a little birdie in front of
a big bad boa constrictor she didnt
speak but she smiled ruby and ill

bet youre in for a ragging when bubbles
gets you alone again you ought to be
more careful old chap

  oh stop your chaff red beau-
champ flushed

chapter xii

  mrs rubens ate supper with the
party and seemed entirely unconscious
of the fact that she was undergoing a
close examination across the spread

  i was so glad to stumble on your
camp she smiled at saunders it has
been awfully lonely at times in these
beastly hills

  must be agreed red he could
see the vivid red of her richly full lips
and the vagrant sheen of the departing
sun in the masses of her light golden
hair the girls seemed to have fallen
under some spell of the woman tod
carter the grim and grizzled sat just
outside the circle with a grin of admira-
tion on his face that would have been
silly in any other man

  why dont you hire guides or join
a party  beauchamp asked he moved
around to get a light for his pipe from
the fire trying to reach a position from
which he might watch her eyes

  i might join a party or hire attend-
ants if either were like you or your
followers she smiled turning to
bubbles and patting her arm do you
know ive never seen such a varied yet
harmonious crowd of human beings i
mean -our men of course she chat-
tered on there must be a dozen dif-
ferent types and races among them to
say nothing of the women and babies
how many men have you not count-
ing the women

 between forty and a hundred
never could keep account of natives
so much alike yknow drawled beau-
champ tomking would know hes
the headman hes keeping watch on
a gang of men who seem to be seeking
trouble

airs rubens arranged her short


peoples story magazine

walking skirt alvmt her knees arid cttled
down like a graceful cat before the hre
again she seemed to be thinking

  you frighten me she said softly
presently im scared to go alone to
my solitary camp would you mind if
i stayed here to-night

  of course we dont replied jess
quickly hashing a look of pleading to
the skipper you can share our tent
if you dont mind crowding

 from the malays camp came
weirdly soft music of reed flutes and
singing the smoldering fires gave out
a pungent aroma of spice twigs and
cedar a gentily sighing breeze dispelled
the lingering heat of departed day and
the camp stirred with the soft rustle of
people preparing to retire for the night

  in the early morning a party of men
started off into the jungle to commence
tapping rubber trees another smaller
party took digging implements and a
portable filter along the boundary line
seeking water supplies when they had
gone the camp breakfast was set and
red and ruby who had confided to
each other their mutual distrust of the
lady waited with some excusable curi-
osity for mrs rubens appearance if
she had failed to appear at all neither
would have been greatly surprised for
tomking had vanished before they
awoke and it was not like him to desert
a post allotted to him

  bubbles first emerged from the tent
and fresh as a dewy violet she seemed
to have lost in her sleep the coolness
which she had shown to beauchamp the
evening before she greeted him mer-
rily and he warmed again in the sun-
shine of her mood he was beginning
to wonder what exactly was the true
nature of miss muriel vincent  what
to expect at any moment in her was
becoming more of a puzzle and for him
this was a serious matter

  he had an inkling of the truth when
jess appeared with mrs rubens and
that inkling gratified rather than

alarmed him w hen be had greeted
jess and turned to bid the guest good-
morning he caught sight of bubbles
gaze bent upon him

  by jove he thought almost aloud
the dear girls jealous t thats cork-
in she wouldnt meddle with jealousy
unless she cared a bit for a chap

  breakfast for ruby beauchamp was
a feast of nectar and ambrosia he
forgot all about mrs rubens and her
questionable status in the exchange of
keen banter between himself and
bubbles

   as soon as we get settled a bit more
we must have some good long talks
he chaffed

   youll need a few lessons first she
retorted

   something interesting i hope

  maybe your caligraphys all
wrong

  ruby looked puzzled his monocled
eye gazed unwinkingly at her

  caligraphyv he echoed thats
writin isnt it by jove bubbles i
believe youve hit on my weak point i
never could write legibly yknow a
thought struck him and he said quickly
but youve never seen my writin pm
certain

  ive seen enough sir  dont like
the way you make eyes

  slowly a grin of understanding spread
over his face and then he fixed her
with a look so eloquent of his real feel-
ings so plainly indicative of their ob-
ject that bubbles lowered her own eyes
with a little blush

  sweet fair tutoress he bantered
kindly we are confusing caligraphy
with anatomy my writin can be reme-
died by buying a typewriter  vote we
change the schedule and take up anat-
omy first when school meets again
lets talk of hearts what

  but perversely bubbles refused to
meet him on the line she had started
lo lay out although she felt in a mood
which should have urged her to wel-
the redheads



come softly anient expressions from the
man who filled her thoughts far more
than she cared to admit yet she chose
to dam the stream with a cold snub

  you talk like an idiot she retorted
rising i advise youto read up a lesson
which will teach you to wait for en-
couragement before assuming you are
entitled to speak of hearts

  she left the group with head held
superciliously high  but ruby detected
the hot color in her face by the glimpse
he got of her graceful throat and small
dainty ears

  mrs rubens chattered continually
merely making talk for she uttered
nothing worth recording but her re-
markable eyes had been busy shehad
seen her hosts and hostesses paired off
as naturally as the birds whose mating
songs rang in the near jungle for all
bubbles willful spark-and-povvder
moods there could be no mistaking her
leaning toward beauchamp nor his
feelings toward her as for jess and
saunders they behaved like perfectly
mated wedded folks their affection for
each other was frankly open and their
tiffs if they ever had such were as
hidden as their regard was plain

  i think i must go now said mrs
rubens when the fijian appeared to
gather up the dishes i would be grate-
ful though if you could let some one
walk part of the way with me ive
grown unaccountably nervous since yes-
terday she fixed her direct wide
open eyes on tod carter bringing a
grin to his rugged old face saunders
caught the suggestion

  tomking he called sharply then
to the woman ill send my headman
with you hes worth six ordinary
men

  oh a native she cried with a
wriggle of the shoulders its the
native im nervous of captain

  very well smiled the skipper
genially ill come too tomking he
called again

  from somewhere back of the malays
camp an answering shout came and in
five minutes tomking appeared his as-
pect striking amazement into the group
his dead-straw colored hair was a smear
of red earth his ugly face was doubly
ugly with streaks of w hite and red his
naked body above and below his loin
cloth was marked like a kongo witch
doctors and he grinned through the
grotesque dirt mask of his face with the
pleasantness of a hungry fiend

  my god gasped mrs rubens
dropping her cigarette and thrusting out
her hands as if to ward off an attack
wont you please leave that horrid
creature behind

  cant replied saunders bluntly
hes the only guide i can trust at
present beauchamp and the girls were
staring open mouthed at the startling
figure of tomking saunders more ac-
customed to the unusual things of life
stared hard once then grinned care-
lessly you need not fear him he
said i suppose its a holiday or some-
thing with him he doesnt bite are
you ready

  she nodded good-by to jess and
bubbles without offering her hand and
stepped out beside the skipper with a
face full of seething anger which was
too intense to be cloaked in a minute
like a holiday-making demon tomking
danced along in the rear making absurd
signals to beauchamp and the girls be-
fore he sped forward to take the lead
his last signal was more in keeping
with a london street urchins character
than the one he had assumed it was a
slow knowing wink and the deliberate
striking of a forefinger against the side
of his shapeless nose three times

chapter xiii

  two miles had been covered before
mrs rubens suddenly awoke to the
fact that tomking was leading the way
to her camp with the directness and
speed of perfect acquaintance


peoples story magazine

  your headman seems to know hs
way she smiled up at him i haven t
given him one direction bui hes right
on the track i believe youve been spy-
ing on me 

  i have done no spying my sell he
replied to her accusation that is a
job i dislike what tomking has done
is a different matter though he may
easily have been just at your elbow day
and night for a week without your
knowing it

  she darted a swift look of suspicion
up at him then the heavy lashes shaded
her eyes again and she replied 

  that is hardly possible i have not
been here that long

  saunders thought he detected fear
and relief in rapid succession both in
her voice and expression he watched
her more narrowly as tomking seemed
to be casting about in doubt and the
relief was unmistakable

  now i am satisfied your man is not
a wizard of direction she laughed
call him back will you hes missed
my camp see here it is

  she drew aside a cedar-brush screen
ten yards away from the goat path
tomking had picked out and saunders
glanced in at a perfect little single-
handed camp to outward appearances
that is it was perfect and only a keen
eye for trifling details would have de-
tected utter lack of camping necessities
which made the womans story yet more
doubtful he noticed too that she was
anxious rather than amused at tom-
kings failure until the man was re-
called and had leaped down from the
ledge to which he had climbed

  you must be warm and tired she
said let me get you a drink

  thanks he smiled back looking
straight into her eyes she lowered her
heavy lashes in well-simulated confusion
which did not fool him i would like
-ome coffee if its no trouble

  a flash leaped from her eyes to be
immediately concealed

  i-er-- think you would prefer
some brandy eh

  no thanks he answered quickly
i take very little of that sort of stuff
coffee suits me best but dont bother
if its putting you to trouble

  he wanted badly to see if the ap-
parent lack of camp furnishings was a
real at apparent she hesitated for a
moment then her laughter rippled out
girlish and without embarrassment

  its foolish of me i know captain
but the fatt is  am all out of every-
thing except a little brandy  have to
make a trip back for stores to-day i
am going to start just as soon as you
are rested

  im not tired mrs rubens ill
come with you shall  

  oh i couldnt think of letting you
do that she cried why i have to
go right in to the fort for supplies

  saunders laughed softly and the
warm color crept into her cheeks her
eyes glittered

  and do you mean you must walk
sixty miles over rugged mountains alone
before you can eat he asked inno-
cently

  its not nearly so far as that

  i assure you it is arent you a bit
out of your way

  anger flamed in her face and gone
for the moment was all pretense she
looked darkly at tomking sitting mo-
tionless in a corner his imagelike face
expressionless and fixed her long
fingers clenched nervously and she was
about to burst into objection to the man-
ner of saunders who lounged easily at
her feet staring up into her face with a
look of complete understanding he
forestalled her

  come mrs rubens he said
sharply cards on the table what is
your connection with that party of rob-
bers who were chased off our lines a
few days ago

  captain saunders she exclaimed
fiercelv you use that tone to me r
the redheads



i thought a woman traveling alone in
this island had only wandering malays
to fear

  thats about all he grinned un-
less a woman traveling alone in this
island is not alone but with a gang of

crooks

  i wont hear you you wouldnt
dare ipsult me like this if rafael-

  i suppose rafael is the chap at the
head of the gang eh the little squib
i kicked off my line and who was dis-
posed of by one of my cannibals

  what the woman stood as if
frozen stiff her great fire-specked eyes
blazing

  saunders put his hand on the ground
and started leisurely to rise he was
satisfied with his discoveries and gave
her a word of advice as he got to one
knee

  i hate fighting with a woman mrs
rubens or whatever your real narrfe is
but i also hate to let anybody man
woman or child upset plans i have
formed if rafael was the chap in
charge of that bunch of land pirates
hes dead i didnt kill him i scarcely
thought him worth while killing but he
certainly asked for trouble of some kind
and got it i wont insult your intel-
ligence by explaining word by word my
reasons but i have no doubt you are in
with that crowd and probably rafael
was only one of the little fish of the
school you will be safer if you keep
as far as possible away from our outfit
and so will messrs kempees van
zoom dutch zim  company har-
court beauchamp has a clear title to
this territory in spite of what your
crooked partners claim i am employed
by him and so are my men theres
not a chance in the world for any out-
sider to horn in and nothing to be got
out of us except plenty of hard knocks
tell the gang that will you

  he stood towering over her smiling
sunnily and for all her worldly veneer
of wisdom that smile deceived her

utterly she flashed a swift question-
ing glance up at him then laughed a
low bubbling laugh of understanding

  i dont pretend to know how you
guessed all this she said i have
heard that you possess an uncanny
knack of getting to the roots of things
but i never believed that you could place
two and two together so-so well so
splendidly wrong may i speak to you
a moment out of sight of that she
rippled pointing with a dainty shudder
at the lumpish figure of tomking

  if you make it brief he answered
dont forget its sixty miles to the fort
and it must be getting near your dinner
hour

  the look she answered him with as
she stepped out on the path would have
been roguish if it were not for the in-
eradicable atmosphere of insincerity and
guile that seemed to radiate from her
at a distance of twenty yards from her
cedar screen she stopped laid a hand
on his arm and nodded rearward

  that was clever of you she smiled
that hideous thing you brought along
with you gives me the creeps we dont
want him to hear all we talk about do
we 

  speak for yourself what have you
to say to me 

  oh dont be so idiotic she re-
turned impatiently i know all about
you and you seem to think you know a
great deal about me why not let us
come to an understanding together it
will save us both a lot of time if you
will chuck out whats in your mind with-
out pretending to such superiority
youre in this game for money arent
you 

  not a doubt he grinned

  so am i so are the men behind me
you were right in one thing anyhow
saunders i am in with a strong crowd
and we mean to work this ground to the
limit we know quite well that you can
make a lot of trouble for us we dont
care a whoop for beauchamp hes a


peoples story magazine

nionocled ass from what x hear you
dont know much about him just
chance acquaintances i gather  hy
dont you come in with usshe con-
cluded flatly meeting his eyes fairly and
stepping close to him

  first let me correct you he replied
beauchamp is far from being an ass
monocled or otherwise he placed you
like a shot never mind now what his
verdict was i can assure you be was
right but to come to business just
what are you offering me

  thats the way to talk i wanted
you or if not you then your grim old
mate or both of you preferably come
in with the five of us who are handling
this business on equal shares after ex-
penses are taken out of the gross
profits

  who determines the profits and ex-
penses kempees  van zoom he
laughed

  of course dont get the idea in
your head that they are smart enough
to make more than their shares out of
the outfit i have them well in hand
i can handle most men captain saun-
ders and-her face was close to his
and he felt her breath on his hand
which was raised to hide the curl of
contempt which persisted in spoiling his
habitual smile-and most men dont
mind a bit occasionally even a man
has sought me

  that i can easily believe he
chuckled then he cast oft all pretense
and banter and stated with cold in-
cisiveness try elsewhere my girl
im neither for sale nor hire at any
price even with your beauteous self
chucked in as a bonus perhaps tom-
king might-

  swine she blazed furiously and
with a lightning motion had drawn a
small revolver from beneath the camera
case at her belt with a movement as
swift saunders gripped both her hands
in his one great fist closing down over
cylinder and butt of the weapon crush-

ing her lingers cruelly against the steel
tagger guard

  let me loose you red gorilla she
screamed fighting viciously with feet
and teeth without haste he drew her
slender wvirus together seized both in
one huge fist and relentlessly unclasped
her finger- from the pistol he gave it
a glance of amused contempt before
hurling it tar out into the scattered
brush of the hillside then still holding
her fast he said coolly

  i shouldnt have suggested tomking

i ought to have referred you to bang
or kohl theyd relish the job of tam-
ing you anyhow you trot hack to
your real camp as fast as you can travel
thats my advice to you let your men
come and try their luck with us we
can give them satisfaction and for
your trouble and in return for the sport
youve given me ill give you the in-
formation you tried so clumsily to get
last night there are in our party beau-
champ and myself the two ladies car-
ter twelve of my crew tomking anti
two battaks thirty malays and their
women a few babies and a half dozen
dogs or so

  he released her and left her standing
as if carved in the living rock a colorful
figure of suffocating rage when he re-
joined tomking and found that worthy
shaking with grim merriment he soon
learned how exactly true his shot had
proved

  you got home to her all right
capll the man assured him shes
the vixen of achin and medan i told
you about

  and is she the teason for this gaudy
smear youre in the skipper grinned
relishing fully for the first time the per-
fection with which tomking had made
himself irrccognizahle had he seen
him except coming in direct answer to
a call red himself could not have sworn
t the mans identity

  sure she is answered tomking
simply


the redheads



    why do you think shed take fright
 if she knew you were here

   perhaps she wouldnt capn but
 that dont worry me at all you leave
 me to my own little game will you
 time enough to dig into my thoughts
 when i dont carry out my duty to you
 and the bunch aint it 

    saunders conceded the truth of this
 and silently led the way back to camp
 he was elated in having done as much
 as he had and now that all the cards
 were dealt it only remained to watch the
 play but while the game went on there
 were other matters of importance to
 claim time and close attention and the
 first and greatest of these was the col-
 lection of gold dust and the establish-
 ment of a line of communication with
 padang the nearest considerable town

   at the camp the girls were alone
 busily employed in the preparation of
 some delectable dish for the evening
 meal in the malay camp the women
 and babies were also alone except for
 the guardianship of a few tail-tucked
 mongrel curs who seemed never to get
 fat but to consist wholly of snarling
 barks inclosed in bony frames

   wheres carter red asked greet-
 ing jess with a light kiss and bubbles
 with a playful pinch of the ear

   gone out to look after the water
 party replied jess ruby went into
 the jungle an hour ago to follow up the
 rubber tappers they each took men
 with them

   hm ought not to have left you
 kids alone say girls dont ever lose
 sight of your weapons from now on
 theres no danger that i can name just
 now but things are maturing one
 thing you have to watch is dont permit
 any stranger man or woman to enter
 the camp without a challenge and under
 no circumstances wander away without
 escort

   red took tomking with him and
 spent some hours in the stream bed

	seeking for traces of gold a few

specks were found but in nothing like
such quantity as had been found on the
other stream he returned to the tent
almost persuaded that the site might
very well be abandoned at least for the
time being and arrived at the camp
fireplace in time to hear a panting shout
from the boundary line and to see kohl
leap into view covered from head to
foot with dry caked blood

chapter xiv

  the battak told his story twice be-
fore tomking appeared to translate it
kohils sinewy body was crisscrossed
with bloody lines scars of knife and
bullet his laboring chest told of stu-
pendous exertions put forth to combat
growing weakness

  your sailors are killed capn
tomking said when kohl had repeated
his story the party you drove off
appeared again in charge of a white-
haired man and started shooting with-
out a word your men sent kohl to
get help when they were all three badly
hurt you see that he didnt shirk
much dont you he found carter and
sent him forward with his party and
came on here to us its too late
though the shooting had stopped be-
fore kohl topped the first rise

  saunders glanced at the girls jess
was shocked but her fair face showed
no alarm her clear gaze met his trust-
fully and bubbles less inured to the
raw facts of life beyond the sharp lines
of established law and order neverthe-
less possessed sufficient courage to en-
able her to repose confidence in her
more experienced friends

   do you mind staying here until ruby
can get back saunders asked jess
the women need somebody with
them

  of course not bubbles cut in
quickly the question had been put to
jess but she had intercepted the cross
glartces from red to jess which showed


peoples story magazine

clearly that it was of her they were
thinking lm not afraid red go on
and get after those murderers

  we can manage all right smiled
jess besides kohl needs attention
before he can walk another step

  he needs nothing more tomking
remarked curtly the battak had col-
lapsed on the ground and tomking had
been busy washing his hurts now the
man hobbled to his feet like a dog after
a fight quite ready to tackle another
one or to run ten miles leaving the cure
of his wounds to mother nature

  all right then decided saunders
seizing his rifle and buckling on an extra
belt of cartridges can he find the
rubber party and tell them to get back
here at once

  sure he can tomking uttered in-
structions in the battak dialect and with-
out another word the man sped away
into the jungle with his keen gray
eyes alight with the genuine apprecia-
tion of a brave man saunders watched
him disappear then he bade tomking
take a rifle to reinforce the knife and
revolver the man insisted on placing his
reliance in

   look after yourself girls he said
as he turned away ruby wont be
long i hope but remember what i
told you a while ago let nobody enter
the camp unchallenged and if you have
to shoot do it sharp and straight come
on tomking

  it was late afternoon when tomking
leaped to the summit of a grassy rise
and paused scanning the slopes of the
hills and the dark edge of the jungle
saunders climbed up beside him

  what do you see  he asked im-
patiently

  see nothing but thought i heard
shots

  it wasnt back at camp dyou
think he hesitated as they started
again

  no out there  said tomking
flinging a hand toward the bush 

  out there a score of men had gone
and beauchamp was with them ahead
lay the real tangible danger ruby
must hold up his own end if unsuspected
trouble came hit way

  by godfrey grunted saunders
after thirty minutes of strenuous march-
ing this is no sort of voyaging for
sea-legs

  the path they followed was only a
path because they trod it loose
boulders scattered broadcast over bar-
ren flats of outcropping rock tripped
them stretches of slipper moss made
each step a slide occasional patches of
vegetation sprouting from the shallow
earth of the hills seemed possessed of
all the devils of thorn and vine known
to the tropics and a moonless night
fell upon them adding darkness to the
already superfluous obstacles of the
journey

  suddenly tomking stopped short
then leaped back beside the skipper lay-
ing a finger on his lips

  dont make a sound-just sniff he
whispered

  around them the land lay dark and
devoid of sound or odor what sparse
vegetation there was gave forth no
fragrance but after a moment of snif-
fing there came to them the faintest of
wood-smoke aromas it was the merest
whiff lasting scarcely long enough to
be detected  but it was there and where
smoke was fire might be expected-fire
and the men who made it tomking
slipped away into the darkness toward
the lower ground leaving the skipper
standing in alert expectancy his rifle
following with its muzzle the direction
from which came the smoke

  minutes seemed like hours in that
weird barren land but finally tomking
glided to his side as silently as he had
vanished and only a quick word of cau-
tion prevented the skipper hurling him-
self upon the man

  what is it he gritted peering hard
to try to read the others face
the redheads



  fire kicked out some coffee in a
calabash still warm a party of some
sort just entered the jungle going east

  you saw them

  no i heard em too far off to
follow without you telling me to shall

i

  leave them to beauchamp he de-
cided forward for us

  they started and through the night
they never rested again with the east-
ern treetops turning from black to olive
and from olive to green in the rising
dawn they dropped down from the
higher ground and entered the jungle as
the hillside glowed into light and the
river came in sight there was no
sound of trouble the birds of the jungle
alone broke the warm misty stillness of
a perfect morning

  wonder where carters got to ob-
served saunders the ribbon-wide
stream the misty hills the awakening
forest all lay bare of human presence
even the bodies he had expected to see
lying about the little camp site were not
in evidence but the moment he stepped
out into the open walking toward the
spot on the stream which he had set his
men to work upon one of carters
sailors stepped from the shelter of a
miniature cliff and grounded his rifle
butt for once the islander was not
smiling

  misser carter he go wid all ands
down ribber he said

 what for whats happened
where are the men they killed  saun-
ders put the queries with impatience

  we bury sammee an tommee an
billee misser carter go for find out
who shootin at us when we dig holes
somebody shootin all de time from
jungle cappen we no see nobody
when we git here i tink maybe you
was look for shoot me so i not cornin
out too soon

  shooting from the jungle hey
he glanced at tomking questioningly
that shrewd bushman shook his head

  bpeo

  it wasnt anybody we heard he
said those shots i thought i heard
soon after we started could easily have
been real but not from anybody who
could possibly reach here for a long time
yet its somebody else want me to
trail the mate

  better eat then sleep he suggested
turning from his scrutiny of the hills to
tomking tomking curled up like a
big dog ready to sleep

  it was then perhaps for the first time
that saunders realized fully the size of
the thing he was up against it the
shots heard far back at the beginning of
the line were indeed real then there
was another party of intruders there
for it was certain that the shots had not
come from any of his own part- and
he did not believe that the gang of bush
cutters he had seen could be the same
as those shots were coming from now
or had been while his men were being
buried he grinned at his solitary
wakeful companion the solemn-faced
sailor and remarked

  so here we are just you and me
petey suppose come long big gang of
bad fellows hey

  all right said petey indifferently
spose he come hei go back quick
hey

  a parrot ravaging a banana bunch by
the streamside stopped eating fruit to
squawk raucously

  out from the shadows of a wide
ledge set in a rolling grass flat stepped
a line of men half a mile away and
without sound or sign to indicate that
they were interested in saunders or his
business started work with pick and
spade down by the trickle of water
which represented the beginning of the
river through his pocket glasses the
skipper watched them closely for some
minutes seeking to identify faces and
to see what sort of man appeared to be
in command

  same bunch  he muttered snapping
the glasses back into the case the


people s story magazine

bush cutters all right bur nobody seems
to be in charge seen them before
pete he asked suddenly	

  no grinned petey then
tink maybe dey all the same fella what
march quick away when yo kick dat
oficer man

  they are did you see them when
you arrived with the mate

  no we see nobody only some-
body shootiu from de bush no see
nobody only sammee an tommee an
pillee dead

  to give every cause tor interference
if such were intended the skipper and
his single sailor took up the tools of the
dead gold washers and went to work
in the bed of the stream they worked
steadily for an hour taking out a small
amount of gold without arousing any
visible interest in the distant working
gang tlie skipper was satisfied he
awakened tomking

  get after carter now he said
bring all hands back here unless
theyre too busy this is a trick to lead
us all into the bush and that peaceful
bunch up there is part of the trick
hurry back ill take a nap while
youre gone

  three hours passed and saunders
woke refreshed to find matters as he
had left them then shortly after he
had waded into the stream in the effort
to obtain a view of its lower course
carter and his men marched into the
open with tomking in the rear every
man wearing a grim vengeful expres-
sion

  like looking for a needle in hay to
search that bush for men growled the
mate wiping the perspiration from his
red face

  no luck

  not for us shoot shoot shoot
and devil a rifle or man could we see
look at the men aint one of em
that aint pipped somewhere

  make camp saunders ordered
well go right to work here let a

couple of runners beat hack along the
line and bring the rest of tlie outfit here
until they arrive well work the stream
and see if we can draw these skunks
from cover you tomking keep bang
with you and make him believe theres
no man in the jungle whose head wont
come off if he slashes at it hard enough
i believe the mans scared of spooks or
something

  not of spooks capn but snakes
returned tomking with a grin

  fbosh what snakes arc- there here
to be afraid of

  none that we know of but bang
swears he saw a cobra slithering
through the leaves-a king cobra at
that

  thats nonsense snorted the skip-
per angrily king cobras may exist
over on the malay side but not in
sumatra

  tomking told bang this but the little
man was unconvinced he chattered
volubly in retort and tomking trans-
lated

  hes sure it was a kerait he saw
hes seen em plenty of times over in
the peninsula and swears lie cant be
mistaken

  as if in proof of bangs assertion
one of the malays suddenly uttered a
scream leaped high in the air and fell
groveling on the earth holding his leg
with both hands and glaring affrightedly
up at saunders as the man fell tom-
king sprang forward slashed with his
knife at something in the rocks and
speared it with his blade he held aloft
the squirming length of an evil flat-
headed cobra
v shocked though he was saunders
acted swiftly and with decision fling-
ing himself upon the stricken malay he
got out his pocket medicine case and
took a razor-edged lancet

  here carter get out the permang-
anate of potash he snapped with
one great hand gripping the struggling
malays leg with tlie other he wielded
the redheads

the lancet and slashed into the quivering
flesh cruelly deaf to the mans
frenzied shrieks he took the potash from
carter poured the crystals into the
bleeding wound and rubbed them into
the raw flesh then from his pocket
flask he poured a half pint of brandy-
down the mans throat and got up

  tie his leg tight above the knee he
said and keep him moving lucky it
happened here

  he looked around knowing that
cobras usually hunt in pairs but no
second creeping terror appeared only
up on the hillside was his gaze arrested

  the working gang a few minutes
earlier indifferent to him and all his
works had ceased their toil and now
stood eagerly scanning the scene just
enacted

chapter xv

  in a ravine under the shadow of
ophir mountain an elaborate tent village
sat a big square tent occupied the
center of a sward whose close fine turf
recalled those miracles of grass seen in
the college quads of oxford around it
were arranged a half dozen army bell
tents and beyond these again a score
or more of a tents lay in a semi-
circle a white man in a dress closely
patterned after a military  uniform
lounged on a tall rock against the sheer
side of the ravine in an attitude of
indolent ease sharply belied by his swift
eagle glance to all sides he sprang
into alert life at the call of a womans
voice from inside the big tent

is there no sign of zimmerman yet

  no maam the man answered
and nothing in sight from below
either

  there was a flutter at the tent flap
and mrs rubens stepped out to gaze
around in annoyance

  verdant bathsheba the man
growled under his breath his eyes
glittered coldly after her as she stepped

across the grass and took the path up
the ravine

  conscious only of the outward exhi-
bition of servility which her presence
drew from the men who sprang up a
she passed the woman strode along with
her head proudly erect and a smile of
scornful superiority on her undoubtedly
handsome face at the brink of a
bubbling spring she sat down crossed
her feet lazily and lay back against a
mossy bank with a cigarette in her
slim fingers she waited with forced
patience for her overdue visitor

  a clattering shower of dnst and small
stones aroused the woman from her
waking-doze and at the upper end of
the defile a column of men appeared
in a flash she was all vivacity flinging
her half-burned cigarette into the spring
with the carelessness of a woman to
whom the trail and camp were but a
necessary nuisance she scrutinized the
approaching party with eager intensity

  the procession was yet too far away
for faces to be distinguishable but a
the figures filed down against the sky-
line they were recognizable to her ex-
pectant eye first came a dozen sturdy
white fellows dressed like the sentinel
in the camp the sun glinted on tlie
steel of weapons their backs were
humped uncouthly with the burdens of
marching soldiers only a vague sug-
gestion of disorderliness in their gait
would perhaps arouse a doubt as to their
real character next behind them
trotted four pairs of lean turbanned
natives each pair carrying a long
shoulder pole to which swung a large
cane basket securely tied with grass rope
then four riders stumbled down the
slope on tiny timor ponies sunburnt
europeans in stout khaki armed put-
ted and sun-helmeted the rear was
brought up by a body of mixed malay
and chinese nondescripts their only
similarity to the rest lying in the arms
they carried and their kicks

  now red saunders well see what
peoples sjory agazle

youll do the woman cried aloud wav-
ing a triumphant hand in greeting to
ihe four riders who separated them-
selves from the others and galloped for-
ward to meet her

   hullo sara the foremost cried
sliding from his pony and seizing her
hand

   im delighted to ee you again she
smiled and gave a hand to each of the
other three men but where is
dutch she glanced along the ap-
proaching line and looked inquiringly at
frhe man who had first accosted her
you havent left him behind have you
major

  for the time being yes said he
had important business to finish up or
something

   business stuff i believe the mans
frightened retorted the woman

  what of the man she addressed
as major stared into her face curiously
the other three men with him closed
around them their expressions hinting
t a desire for explanations what can
ie be afraid of repeated the major
tie knows quite well what were after
ooesnt he 

   sara flashed a glance at the halted
column and said quickly dont stop
iere get the men into camp well
talk over things while youre having
something to eat come

   it was a formidable little army in
numbers that mustered on the grassy
sward to be told off to the a tents
only the turbanned natives with their
ifcaskets under escort of four armed
whites continued  down the ravine
to the foothills those remaining
speedily settled down like hardened
campaigners and fires sprang up along
-he cliff-side under bubbling cooking
jjots in front of the big tent the four
headers of the band ate their lunch with
che woman at the only table in the
camp and she answered their questions
concerning the fancied or real reasons
for dutch zims sudden fright

  i may be wrong she smiled enig-
matically until i met this saunders
 would have believed there was nothing
for us to fear but hes rather a puzzle
to me lies different from any man
ive met before  dont think hes the
sort to be frightened away

     hat  a lot of rot exclaimed the
major we can chase any man away
with the crowd we have  you havent
given us the wrong steer altogether 
shouldnt wonder if beauchamps na-
tives are in a funk now

  tve given you no wrong steer the
woman cried angrily ive done my
part the natives or ome of them
are scared but the three whites and
the two girls dont scare as easily as 
expected dutch zim evidently knows
that

  oh there are girl eh smiled a
younger man with a precociously evil
face that promises interest

  shut tip corny snapped the
major you and blum and rivi are
here to play a mans game not to look
googoo-eyed at girls

  seems to me dots th proper game
for mans drawled blum the major
scowled blackly at him and persisted
but what about dutch zim what
do you mean by saying he may be
frightened 

  well he was so savagely eager to
swing in with me that he has even
double crossed his own partners i be-
lieve now he hangs back when every-
thing looks ready and open you ought
to have brought him with you i be-
lieve hes scared of this big tough saun-
ders and i dont wonder at it since i ve
met-the auburn gentleman  dont trust
dutch r

  there was a brief silence while to-
bacco was lighted then sara leaned her
elbows on the table and related what
had happened along beauchamps border
line

  and that red-headed beast of a saun-
ders laughed in my face and scorned
the redheads



me she said savagely her slim
fingers- twisted and twined in the stuff
of her dress and her breast rose and
fell agitatedly i have a mind to try
my luck with the other brick-topped
fool

  well lets get down to business
said the major then perhaps you
and i can find something less weighty
to talk about what is exactly the situ-
ation down there at present

  im waiting for a messenger now
the last one this morning reported a
good start made three of the crew of
saunders schooner were put out of
business and those are the men we must
look out for the rest are only malay
laborers and easily run off they have
women with them too and kids so it
wont be long before we put the fear
of death into them and send them scoot-
ing back home then we have a party
of six dyaks with two of zims special
gunmen at present beating up toward
the rubber tappers saunders sent out to
work another bunch of twelve are
with old harlem job putting the shakes
into the bunch at tlie gold camp saun-
ders must have flown to get there as
quickly as he did he rather spoiled
the game but at that the cobras we had
have been turned loose and one of his
malays got bitten

  thats good the rest got a fright
hey

  not so bad as they ought that
redhead is a regular man for all that
hes a nuisance to us he had that
bitten nigger down and filled with per-
mangate of potash in less time than it
had taken the snake to bite him and
the mans cured whats more to the
point the snakes killed that clay-
smeared devil-dancer or whatever he is
killed the brute with a knife

  from what i can see that saunders
chap is no easy mark observed corny
is he the only one of that kind

  not at all replied sara sharply
she was uneasy under the majors per-

sistent gaze beauchamp is as tough
though he isnt so used to tight places
as saunders as for old carter the
schooners mate well i thought him
easy until i had a chance to study him
more hes just a whipcord and whale-
bone old sailor without imagination and
without nerves none of those three
men is scarable by ordinary means we
have to work on the malays and make
it impossible for beauchamp to work his
land and theres none too much time
either

  oh it wont take long rivi put in
coldly we brought sixteen she cobras
all fat and theyll get to work very
quickly after those hindoo chaps turn
em loose only thing we have to worry
about is seeing that none of our people
go into the bush without boots and
leggins

  when do we move down to the
ground asked corny

  as soon as we get word that beau-
champs crowd are all on the spot re-
turned the major curtly he rose
nodded to sara and she followed him
down the ravine away from the camp
at the foot of a precipitous pinnacle of
volcanic rock he paused looked about
him sharply and perched himself on a
ledge with his back to the sheer face

  sit down and let us talk over things
he said

  sara took a seat leaning slightly
against his shoulder and smiled up into
his eyes with a world of subtle allure
in her own some of the unpleasant
quality passed out of his expression in
the warmth of her near presence but
the man seemed to be laboring tmder
some deep uneasiness which would not
permit him to show an entirely pleasant
face

  what things are left to talk about
except ourselves she laughed

  it is of ourselves or rather you i
mean to speak one thing i insist that
you remember is that i wont have you


peoples story magazine

casting sheep eyes at other fellows
understand 

  my major is jealous she cjied
mockingly you poor poor boy will
you not understand that  have eyes for
none but you if i smile on our
enemies is it not to their misfortune
must i tell you again that i am yours
and yours only she swiftly wreathed
her arms about his neck pulled down
his head and fastened her lips to his
in a passionate kiss the man shud-
dered ins eyes gleamed fiercely and he
crushed her yielding body to him but
he was still master of himself

  far down the ravine sounded a chal-
lenge and an answer and the woman
twisted around to look a native leaped
from rock to level waving a hand aloft
at a sentinel sharply outlined against
the blue sky

  it is the messenger we are waiting
for she said flashing her companion
the softest of smiles

  come then he replied we will
take his report at the camp the others
want to hear it

  they returned to the tents arm in
arm and on the summit of the rock
beneath which they had sat a white
sentry in a semi military dress crouched
peering after them with a demon of
hate io kis glittering eyes

chapter xvi

  down at the main camp jess and
bubbles waited for beauchamps ap-
pearance with growing concern the
native camp was murmurous with softly
whining children and hushed-voiced
women even the nonedescript curs
ceased to yelp for endless food or yap
at stirfging insects a praying mantis
devouring a fly on an orchid cup ap-
peared to be the only normal living
creature in sight

  it seemed hours before kohl broke
out of the jungle at the head of beau-
champs party and by that time the

night shadows stretched far and black
a shrill chattering from the women
told the malays in one terrific chorus
of the events down the line and ruby
emerging from the bush last of all self-
constituted rear guard against the as yet
unseen peril met two girls whose seri-
ous faces warned him that matters
might not be quite well

  by jove girls he ejaculated
humorously everybodys blue and full
of shakes by appearances old kohl
came hot foot after us and jabbered a
lot o stuff alxut killin and that sort o
tiling but for the life of me i cant
understand a half of what hes gassin
about what is it you both look
grumpy

  come in to supper suggested jess
quietly better not let the men see
were worried theyre inclined to see
danger in shadows you know

  during the meal the girls told him
what had happened and his face grew
serious for once fearless as he was
he could yet see in saunders sudden
departure leaving the two girls alone
practically grounds for deep cogitation
with the men at his disposal he felt
that the camp and stores were amply
secured but merely to have heard the
news of the deaths of three of the skip-
pers trusty gilbert islanders drove out
his buoyant spirits and darkened his soul
with gloom

  and we are to stay here he queried
hopelessly

  for the present jess replied i
think our best plan always is to follow
reds instructions until we see at least
that things are desperate

  ruby glanced at her with warm ad-
miration in his grave eyes

  by jove he exclaimed his mon-
ocled eye fixed directly upon her face
causing her to color a little by jove
you are the most loyal young person i
ever met jess no wonder your
guardy or adopted daddy or whatever
saunders is is proud of you
the redheads



  jess eyes opened wide and her rosy
mouth formed a circle

  oh she gasped then she stared
hard at bubbles their eyes met and she
laughed merrily while bubbles the pic-
ture of a person groping in darkness
first stared back at her friends then
flashed a look of question at ruby and
finally assumed a look of petulant an-
noyance

  im sure i dont know in the least
what amuses you she said distantly

  jess hastened to smooth her chums
ruffled plumage and soon the girls re-
tired to their tent leaving beauchamp
to smoke his pipe out before seeking his
own blanket

  rum set-out he muttered puffing
fiercely at his pipe old saunders
seems to be satisfied to go ahead but
its a shame to drag the girls into a mess
like this the train of thought trans-
ferred his serious consideration from
the enemy outside to the guests within
and he rose to seek his blanket with
the resolve that he would see about
sending the girls back to civilization im-
mediately day dawned

  as he lay more wakeful than when
he lay down his handsome face wore a
smile which became brighter and less
repressible with even thought of
bubbles and her little mannerisms her
flaring anger and quick recovery of
spirits her petulance childish at times
with his carefree attitude toward her
when in one of her most seriously angry
moods all these went to form a de-
licious picture before his minds eye

  an uneasy slumber smothered ruby
beauchamp just before dawn broke
leaving his mind still puzzling over mat-
ters the first gray light had not turned
to the flush of the true deiwn when
saunders messenger sneaked into the
camp gave his identity to the sentinel
and aroused beauchamp to the knowl-
edge of big tilings a-brewing a hasty
breakfast was followed by a doubly
hasty striking of camp and a stores-

and-lumber laden march over the foot-
hills trail to the northward

  it was about ten oclock by sun time
when a rear-guard scout announced that
a column of fire had risen above the
site of their lately vacated camp

  there goes our material laughed
ruby uneasily he screwed his mon-
ocle more tightly into his eye and faced
the girls until that moment he had
forgotten all his problems of the sleep-
less night before now he saw in all its
nakedness the grimuess of the business
ahead and with it came again the con-
viction that he must secure the girls
against further danger no matter at
what cosit to his own affairs

  look here girls he said im going
to escort you to some safe place
theres going to be a mess here and i
wont have you mixed up in it well
cross the hills and go to the fort what
without red jess demanded hotly
in a moment her warmth passed leaving
her pretty face smooth and smiling
bubbles looked her complete accord with
her chum though she utttered no word
jess went on quietly better do as
he suggests mr beauchamp its usu-
ally best in the end

  by jove i believe youre right jess
i always forget that you have acquired
an unbreakable faith in saunders in-
fallibility

  he gave the order to resume the
march and the girls swung forward in
the midst of the line himself at the
head

chapter xvii

  a weary party camped that night
for the pace had told upon the girls and
the packs had borne down the carriers
but jess and bubbles had both insisted
that the march be made without un-
necessary loitering and beauchamp was
glad to agree with them not until nine
oclock were the girls able to retire to
their little tent to snatch what rest they
could in preparation for an early re-
peoples story magazine

itart jess lay drowsily awake listening
amusedly to the turning and twisting of
her chum whose horror of creeping and
hopping things as suggested by ruby
was too strong to permit her to woo
sleep in peace

  ugh the brute cried bubbles with
an audible shudder

  found something drawled jess
sleepily

  no snapped bubble angrily i
was referring to him

  him  queried jess innocently

  oh you know whom  mean i
think lies a beast

  tess lay quiet for several minutes
and the deep agitated breathing of her
friend set the blankets rustling

   you treat him shamefully bubbles
jess said presently you deserve to
be made to shiver why do you hate
ruby so hes a good sort

  i know he is i know he is and i
dont hate him-i-i-love him jess
bubbles blurted passionately but i
cant let him see it can i 

  seems to me that would be the
simplest thing to do came back in
muffled tones and jess went peacefully
to sleep leaving her chum covering a
burning face with her blanket and try-
ing to persuade herself that she had not
made that important confession

  but with the commencement of an-
other days march her old irrepressible
spirit of teasing reasserted itself she
was again the mischievous imp of the
party ever trying by speech and gesture
to irritate the leader somehow beau-
champ had contrived either to cast her
from his mind altogether or to assume
a clever appearance of having done so
for he paid her less attention than he
gave to his bearers and jess received
more than a fair share of consideration

  hello ruby youre just in time to
preside as judge at a funeral saunders
said quietly he had warmly welcomed
the girls given a kindly word to the
perspiring laborers and their tired

womenfolk and now gave beauchamp
a brief thorough review of what had
happened

  thats a micks metaphor old chap
smiled the ruby one in response one
doesnt judge a funeral yknow like a
horse-show whats tlie bally joker
he liad taken in the general aspect of
the camp with keen anxious eyes and
a sort of sixth sense told him that there
was a deep undercurrent of uneasiness
running beneath the exterior calm of
the party two brawny seamen stand-
ing apart from tlie rest at the edge of
the jungle leaned on their rifles with
an attempt at apparent ease but failed
to convey that impression of ease to the
sharp eye peering through the monocle
saunders hesitated until jess and
bubbles had walked away a few yards
then said with a grimness that contrasted
strongly with his usual manner

  theres no joke about this ruby
weve collared the white-haired old vil-
lain who killed my three sailors

 by jove that is good news
where is the rotter

  over there along with three of his
gang we slipped in behind them a
couple of hours ago while they were
taking potshots at us from cover i
want to know what you propose doing
with them now youre here

  oh i dont want to interfere red
go ahead on whatever you intended

  come over and see them replied
red shortly then at tlie edge of the
bush he said  ware snakes old
chap forgot to mention them the
bush is crawlin with em

  suddenly beauchamp saw the cause
of -that vague uneasiness he had sensed
in the camp even the false ease of
the two seamen became a justifiable
thing

  snakes he echoed halting ab-
ruptly he feared snakes as he feared
northing else on earth surely you re
mistaken

  no im not ive seen two men
the redheads

bitten myself one our own man i
saved  the other one of the murdering
gang pegged out theyre cobras and
theyve been dumped here to chase us
out come and take a look at the hoary
old scoundrel responsible

  by jove i the chap ought to hang
ejaculated ruby angrily

  just what he would hav done had
you been half an hour later grinned
saunders

  the white-haired leader of the cap-
tured marauders looked up curiously as
beaucamp stared down at him he pre-
sented a queer study in types along
with his men his face was smooth
and pink his eyes wide and almost inno-
cent in expression his hair snowy and
long like the hair of a patriarch but
beneath the outward expression lay a
stinging suggestion of evil

  well gentlemen whats the ver-
dict he drawled better finish me
off before the rest of the crowd get
here or else youll be the victims in-
stead of me

  what are you doing here anyhow
demanded beauchamp did you bring
the snakes here

  dont waste time with him ruby
put in saunders impatiently of
course he brought the snakes i told
you that

  by jove we ought to hang him
beauchamp exclaimed again

  better get busy then laughed the
prisoner evilly you have just about
time enough to find a tree and run me
up before your own hour strikes here
for good

  come jerked saunders moving
away abruptly beauchamp hesitated
a leering grin of triumph spread over
the pink face of the old scoundrel on
the ground

  sort o scares you hey he grinned
dont dare hold that little hanging bee
hey better turn me loose mister
your times about up here

  no i wont do that just yet re-

turned the skipper taking beauchamps
arm and leading him away  leave
you tied and have you carried farther
into the jungle perhaps ill turn you
loose later meanwhile the snakes will
keep you amused no doubt

  a harp order sent the two sentries
with help to carry the four deeper into
the recesses of the concealing bush  and
the alacrity they showed in returning
was proof enough of the fear that had
entered the camp since those snakes ap-
peared

  i think thatll punish them as hard
as hanging the skipper remarked
shouldnt care to be in their shoes
myself

  nor i beauchamp agreed with a
shudder but what can we do with
the brutes after all cant really hang
em can we

  youd better believe we can do any-
thing ruby thats why i suddenly
brought you away from that old repro-
bate yonder it struck me that he was
rather cocksure about our time being
almost up i dont think he was bluf-
fing

 you think-

  i think we shall see more of the
delightful mrs rubens very shortly
said saunders as they emerged from the
jungle tomkings gone away into the
hills to scout around better make up
your mind what line to follow old chap
did you leave a guard back at the other
stream to look after the gear

  no beauchamp acknowledged with
a guilty grimace i left nobody now
theres nothing left to guard some-
body set fire to it as soon as we left
we saw the smoke

  the skipper grinned cheerfully

  its just as well perhaps leaves
us more men at this end ruby and
its a lot better to have our stuff burned
on the dump instead of after its erected
eh  it proves too that there are rascals
down that end as well as here im


peoples storyr magazine

sorry now we let the malays bring their
women along

  cant we send em back at least to

the boats

  dyou think theyd chance that
jungle now there are snakes about
the only way would be to take ern over
to the other bank seems to me that
these cobras have only been chucked into
our camp

  i vote we do that beauchamp said
earnestly im not as wise in this sort
of thing as you are skipper but i seem
to feci in my bones that somethings
about due to happen i suggested to
jess and bubbles that i take em over

to the font but- his gesture told

saunders the rest as clearly as words

  of course they wouldnt quit red
said with a grin its the malays with
their babies i was thinking of i told
you at first that jessand bubbles would
stick like glue but lets see what car-
ter has to say he seems to be bursting
with news

  tod carter appeared from tlie
tumbled foothills perspiring and hur-
ried his manner contrasted strongly
with the attitudes of his smiling seamen
who carried on their allotted tasks like
machines he bounced down over the
rockyr declivity careless of limb in-
different to bruises with his mouth and
eyes wide open

  hey skipper come up here he
barked hoarsely halting as soon as he
realized how near he had come to the
camp saunders and ruby sprang for-
ward and the mate at once turned again
and led them at a rattling pace up the
slopes until he reached a sharp right-
angled turn in the face of the hillside

  look at that he panted and
pointed far down a narrow defile
toward the looming mountains

  the skipper took out his binoculars
and gazed long and intently winding
around a turn in the undistinguishable
trail from the mountains swung a pro-
cession of twelve men eight of them

white-clad and turbanned bore great
baskets slung to long shoulder poles
four whites armed stumbled along with
them two ahead two following a
hundred yards behind them displaying
what seemed to be extreme caution two
white men rode slowly along on small
ponies halting every few paces as if
fearful of attracting attention from
those men in front as the pair of
rider entered the field of his glasses
saunders uttered an astonished growl
and rubbed his eyes giving the glasses
to beauchamp

  what dyou make of it he grunted

  ruby stared long and narrowly then
said simply

  whats the bally excitement red
its only old tomking cornin back widi
a stranger

  tomking the devil saunders
snatched the glasses before he could
pick up the spot again liowever a
double turn of the -trail brought all three
parties in view at the same time though
neither could see the other its dutch
zim

  and tomking too added beau-
champ

  yes an that no good mate o yours
what you put into hospital dan mallet
growled carter savagely

chapter xviii

  the procession of three separate
parties disappeared again as the trail
wound in serpentine fashion and did
not appear for fifteen minutes when
the leaders the two forerunners of the
basket carriers suddenly emerged at a
point on the stream side and halted
they obviously were not expecting to
find saunders and his entire party in
bold view in the open for they vanished
backwards as swiftly as they had ap-
peared

  through the clear air came shouts
and cries not to be distinguished as any-
thing particularly except the sounds of
wordy conflict then dutch zim and
the redheads



dan mallet stepped forward stared and
as suddenly bobbed back now their
growling voices could be heard mingling
with the sharper cries heard before
saunders and his friends stood their
ground anxious at first later amused
curious concerning what might ensue

  the plot thickens by jove grinned
ruby rubbing his hands gleefully
what part of our appearance dyou
suppose is so alarming as to make em
all bob back that way 

  search me muttered saunders
perhaps dan mallet got chilly feet at
sight of us wait and see

  the skipper and beauchamp walked
away from the others and stood on the
brink of the river watching the spread-
ing banks which might so easily contain
a navigable body of water but in which
now trickled the merest of runlets fed
by the tiniest of brooks

  this dodging time gets on my
nerves complained ruby

  im only dodging time until tomking
gets back i have a lot of faith in the
chap red scanned the stream regret-
fully ifs are the excuses of beaten
men ruby but this old river would
certainly be more encouraging with
more water in it

  that seems to be an unavoidable
drawback doesnt it

  apparently anyhow well do as
you suggest lets get all hands busy
and make a camp that looks permanent
at least it will give jess and bubbles
a sense of comparative security come
along with me first of all well take
some of my crew who are steady of
nerve and beat the bush for snakes
there cant be so many of em i sup-
pose

  saunders and ruby led the way into
the jungle beating every bush routing
out holes in the rocky ground perhaps
a bit nervous at first confidence grew
as they progressed without results and
the peril seemed almost at the vanishing
point then they were abruptly brought

to a creepy halt by a scream of deadly
fear in the thick forest ahead

  the prisoners

  saunders uttered the words as he
plunged through a cane brake and
beauchamp tore after him

  the prisoners had been left to them-
selves tied to trees and in ordering his
men to carry them farther into tlie bush
the skipper had omitted to specifically
set a guard over them now a dramatic
little piece of byplay fast merging into
tragedy burst upon their view as they
entered the level glade in which the cap-
tives lay

  the white-haired old scoundrel who
had been responsible for introducing the
creeping horror into the quiet jungle
crouched with his back to a tree knees
drawn up to his chin his bound hands
working frenziedly at his bonds and
his smooth pink face a mask of panic
in front of him stood a malay laborer
and in his right hand he held a cleft
stick at the fork of which squirmed
and hissed a four-foot king cobra the
open mouth and venomous fangs within
six inches of the old mans terror-
stricken eyes

  drop that roared saunders and
leaped forward with outstretched hand
but he was too late the cobra struck
and the mans howl rang piercingly
through the forest glades the malay
dropped the stick and ground the
snakes head beneath his sandaled heel
then looked up and met the skipper s
angry eyes with a shrug of the shoul-
ders

  he make snake kill my brudder he
remarked simply and turned away

  saunders made no reply none
seemed called for it was justice crude
but rigid and he realized it curtly
bidding beauchamp cut the victims
bonds he got out his lancet and went
swiftly to work to do what might be
possible to avert death but now his
efforts proved futile the old man s
mddv face turned pale and his eves
people s story magazine

hardened while the full ed lips
quivered piteously the man winced
but uttered no cry when the perman-
ganate bit into the wounds he waited
until the skipper had finished then mut-
tered hoarsely

  thanks skipper i wouldxi t have
done this much for you but  m done
for cant put a tourniquet round my
neck you know he laughed bitterly
if youd done that a while ago and
slipped the rope over a tree limb this
wouldnt have happened

  the skipper sent his men back to the
open with the other three captives for
liis ideas of treating even enemies would
not permit him longer to leave them in
a situation which he had ordained for
them in anger only to frighten them
then he laid the stricken man down
trying to give him ease for the short
space remaining to him

  here take a swig of brandy urged
beauchamp hastily the mans condi-
tion got on the ruby ones nerves
beastly way to peg out old horse
what the devil did you come here for

  the man swallowed a great gulp of
spirit and something like an ashamed
grin succeeded the spasm of strangling
that followed the swallow

  im not kickin at the way  pass
out he gasjed i can take my medi-
cine when i back a loser i guess i got
a wrong idea of you chaps anyhow
thought you were a pair o tough sports
in somebody elses preserves but a
fellow does queer things for money an
booze an women he strangled pain-
fully ask that squash-nosed guide o
yours he choked and rolled over in
a spasm of agony from which he never
recovered

  wonder what lie meant mused
beauchamp later when he and the skip-
per again stood on the bank of the
stream wondering what had happened
to tomking and the procession of
strangers

  find out soon i expect growled

saunders i wi-rti hed told us how
many more snakes there are though
before lie cashed in his chips got two
didnt we

   three in all counting the one that
killed our malay ugh the shivery
brutes

  the prolonged waiting on the verge
of expectancy began to affect the nerves
of beauchamp when dusk fell and yet
tomking did not appear

  i vote we have supper saunders
ruby suggested when he had twice ex-
perienced a strange chill running down
his spine he had also detected more
than a passing uneasiness in the face
of bubbles who trying hard to emulate
the quiet poise of jess was nevertheless
coming under the spell of the suspense-
haunted atmosphere saunders himself
seemed to jump slightly at hearing
ruby voice

  i second that he agreed and left
the river bank after a last keen scrutiny
of the little ravine out of which the
main stream trickled well go ahead
as if there was no shadow mi interrup-
tion beauchamp the battaks never
sleep so well have them posted one on
this side and the other at the rear then
all hands can turn in as usual and if
tomking doesnt show up by the time
weve finished supper ill take one of
them along with me and see just what
is going on up there in the hills

  there was a forced effort at supper
on all sides to appear at ease and out-
wardly it was successful to the extent
of imbuing the malays with confidence
but many a carefully veiled glance of
question passed from jess to saunders
to be as carefully avoided

  the skipper lounged on the edge of
the platform which had been built as
a protection against the snakes his cigar
burning steadily his alert face turned
toward the hills

if yer inside you cant be outside by a damn
      sight

haw haw haw
the redheads



  the interruption came in a clear
piercing peal from across the river-bed
and saunders leaped to his feet

  thats tomking he declared with
vast relief

chapter xix

  the last note of the doggerel had
scarcely ceased when it was answered
from the camp by bang and kohl utter-
ing together the yell by which tomking
had summoned them once before on the
river march like an echo the yell was
answered in turn and the two battaks
slipped like ghosts through the darkness
and stood under the platform edge

  tomking he wanna spik yo sar
grunted bang

  saunders leaped to the ground dis-
daining the ladder and into the vague
radiance of the dying fire  stepped
tomking with a stranger in uniform
armed

  this is a brother o mine capn
tomking announced briefly and pro-
ceeded without apparently caring how
saunders accepted the announcement

  joe here is one o the gang along
with that woman hes harmless
though sentry thats his job and hes
takin a rest found him by accident
that dont matter though this is the
news capn dyou remember how that
first gang o men acted when you kicked
their ganger over the line first day up
here 

  saumders nodded

  well tomking went on theyre
sore with their job they want to come
in with you they were told a lot o
lies they aint bad chaps most of em
though if you take em youll have to
watch one or two o em i can do
that

  the skipper tried to get a clear view
of tomkingc suddenly discovered
brother the cool introduction into the
camp of an armed member of the
enemys party followed by the bald

statement of relationship and in turn
succeeded by such a proposal as taking
irrto his bosom the crowd who had first
initiated hostilities was food for
thought of the deepest tomking
sensed the skippers suspicions and ab-
ruptly stepped close in and thrust his
expressively ugly face into reds

   look here capn have i served the
 outfit well or badly

   well answered saunders unhesi-
 tatingly	

   all right dont begin to doubt me
 now a note of passion crept into the
 mans voice here take a look at us
 together

   saunders was forced to grin as the
 flickering light of the lantern in the hut
 revealed those two faces side by side
 it had appeared unlikely that there could
 be two such faces yet here they were
 beautifully ugly frank fearless almost
 embarrassingly direct of gaze

   beauchamp the skipper called
 ruby dropped down beside the group
 meet tomkings brother ruby

  for a second or two beauchamp
stared at the brothers then he laughed
and with saunders joining in tomking
and his brother were accepted at pretty

 	much their own valuation

   and you found him by accident
 the skipper doubted with a smile which
 was reflected in an instant in both the
 brothers faces

   well we would have met i suppose
 some time or other but it was an acci-
 dent to-day grinned tomking how
 about bringin them men in though
 theyre just over the river then
 theres another thing to talk about when
 thats settled

   hm how about this ruby the
 skipper hesitated he briefly told beau-
 champ of tomkings suggestion

   what can we do with the blighters
 queried ruby wont it mean keeping
 watch everlastingly on them

  tomking undertakes that duty
 though he says theyre all right we
g

 can use them easily senrl em along
 with old tod carter and have em build
 a real dam down river then we can use
 our boats up here and double our
 strength besides having some means of
 transport other than humping packs
 over the mountains

  lets interview the bally deserters
first suggested ruby he started
toward the river when tomking
stopped him

  ill fetch their <*x>kesman over he
said dont you gents cross over yet
a while dutch ziras over there farther
up holding a confab with another
branch of the rotten tree ill tell you
presen tlym

  in ten minutes tomking returned in
company with two men who bore be-
tween them a big cane basket this
they kept firm hold of while saunders
examined them apparently they were
genuinely anxious to quit their present
employers their answers as regards
reasons and intentions satisfied beau-
champ and the skipper and after a mo-
ments consideration saunders re-
marked 

  all right men bring your gang
over and make camp behind us youll
have to go short on rations until we cart
send down to the forks for more some
of your noble pals set fire to half a ton
o grub back at the south end

  weve got rations sir replied the
spokesman civilly each man in the
gang will bring his own and if were
coming in with you we might as well
leave this basket you can use whats
in it i expect

  what is it

  mongooses we pinched it from the
new crowd jusft arrived they brought
three baskets of cobras to drive you out
and a basket of mongooses to choke off
the snakes when they took possession
after you we left em the snakes
theyre having a noisy argument with
mister dutch zimmerman just now
about whos boss over them

  peoples story magazine

  tomking and his brother conducted
the immigration of the new recruits and
set a guard over their camp unknown
to them to keep them secure until they
could be more thoroughly inspected in
daylight then the basket of small
snake-killers was put in charge of a
mala- who understood the little beasts
and tomking requested the skipper and
beauchamp to listen to his further com-
munications before his brother started
back to his own camp

   fire away said the skipper

  tomking held silence for a moment
peering up into the darkness of the
trees then he gulped dryly and spoke

   first of all gents lets get straight
on my motives in joining up with you
dutch zim i told you didnt i and
thats right too so far as it goes but
theres more joe here is boss watch-
man of that womans personal gang and
keeps good guard too tell you why
that jezebel was my wife

   a little cry fluttered out on the dark-
ness from bubbles and jess on the plat-
form above and tomking glanced up in
doubt

   go on saunders told him quietly

  yes sir my wife repeated
tomking now you know why i want
her to draw payment in full the poor
dupe whos with her now a major of
the royal army is going crooked at her
beguilement just as that other poor
young fool did up in achin but rt was
dutch zim who first took her from me
it was zim who sold me to the achinese
cannibals leaving me crucified to two
trees up in their wild country so that he
might carry away both my wife and my
gold that little trick failed so far as
killing me goes by sheer accident i
managed to get on the right side of old
bangs father and lived

  but for the present you may know
hat joe is in the confidence of that
woman because she knows hes my
brother believes hes madly in love with
her and she believes and thinks he be-
the redheads



iieves me dead shes promised him
everything a man can wish for in earth
or heaven and he knows her for what
she is

  dutch zim has deserted her too
mad at her fickleness and greed now
he and dan mallet are trying to seduce
the hindus and their leaders from her
service if rhey can do that those
cobras intended for you will he turned
adrift up the ravine where her own
camp and followers lie tomking
stopped and grinned up at his taciturn
brother shouldnt wonder if they
have some fun pretty soon whichever
way they come to terms the chaps
who pinched the mongooses marked one
of the snake baskets like the mongoose
basket before they left

  beauchamp and saunders sat a while
in silence when tomking ceased and
on the high platform the girls could be
heard conversing in whispers pres-
ently ruby wanted to know

  accepting all this tomking just
how does it really affect us what do
you want us to do

  only this gents carry on your own
business as if there wasnt a crook this
side o sing sing or newgate leave
joe and me to our own affairs and dont
interfere when the showdown comes if
it comes in your presence youll have
trouble as you expect and  m your
man but i want the woman and joe
wants dutch zim

  but what on earth is all this battle
murder and sudden death about burst
out beauchamp irritably why does
an army corps of crooks swoop down
upon us as soon as we land on our law-
ful domain

  youve picked out a plum sir thats
why  returned joe that kempees
 van zoom out lit knows it and they
started in to queer you

  yes we know all that stuff inter-
rupted saunders impatiently but
kempees van zoom dutch zim and
a gang like them couldnt outfit a

crooked arnly on such a scale as this
why man alive even the fat chink-
down at that stinking village at pulo
lawan tried to stop us our river
dtam was cut twice our guards killed
and our stores up north end burned the
moment they were left unguarded we
were attacked in force three of our
men killed then these cobras dyou
mean to tell me dutch zim has brains
or power enough to carry on that
way 

  not they captain joe replied
my brother has told you something
of the cleverness of this woman even
before he revealed her identity or his
own dutch zim and his sharp lawyers
could manage to drive the ordinary con-
cessionaire away with a cooked-up yarn
of faulty titles but this thing is bigger
than you imagine that fat old china-
man at pulo lawan has been all over
this territory he reported it simply
saturated with petroleum through the
entire middle there is goldi as you
have discovered the rubber you can
gather in a month will load down a
score of mules at the first shipping

  youre up against something bitter-
and thats this woman-rubens she call-
herself-and the man whos dancing at
the music of missus bathsheba just now
was a gentleman not long ago hes
selling his immortal soul plus the name
of a gentleman-which in real life is
worth far more-for this womans
tinsel favors and hell wade through
hell now eat brimstone and act like
no devil could ever act rather than
acknowledge failure

  and what of zim and his partner
inquired ruby

  theyll put up a fight and a hard
one because they have on their side
those shyster lawyers but make no
mistake both of those gangs will join
hands before they let mr beauchamp
here get away with his bargain

  and your object is-what saun-
ders put in simply revenge
peoples story magazine

  not revenge alone captain tom-
king interjected hastily   hat  or
savages and small-time crooks allow-
ing that id gladly tie zim to a tree and
let the maggots dig sirfways through
him thats only justice aint it as
for the woman hasnt a husband a right
to spank a naughty wife

  tlie mans tone although his words
were commonplace sent a rippling
shiver through his audience lhe girls
above uttered a little gasping cry in
chorus

  no its not revenge oflly tomking
concluded that is a motive which
stops at the consummation of a definite
act i have a motive which goes so far
beyond that that after i am through
there ought to be no more land-shark-
ing in sumatra no more seduced wives
no more seduced officers who were once
gentlemen and if the luck holds good
no more decent men turned into sav-
ages as i have been

chapter xx

  a tranquil night was succeeded by
an uneventful morning tomkings
brother had returned to his post tod
carter had taken his new recruits after
a keen inspection of them on a long
march down river to start building a
dam no sign came from the lurking
antagonist in the hills and a mongoose
had already killed a cobra

  in the stream bed overfull from the
rains of the night a party of malays
serenely washed gravel and sand under
the smiling overseership of a lean hawk-
eyed islander malay women had al-
ready settled down in their new quar-
ters as if noalarm had ever been
sounded jess and bubbles passed from
mother to mother giving simple physics
to combat infantile colics and mulli-
grubs

  we might as well get busy prepar-
ing for boring on that western oil

ground suggested saunders scanning
the peaceful camp

   think its safe to leave the outfit
beauchamp asked with a sidewise
glance at the perfectly unconcerncd
girls so lightly did tlie situation im-
press them that bubbles had treated him
that morning to another exhibition of
her wayward moods and he had in
revenge turned to jess for comrade-
ship he was still chuckling over the
result he could stall see the blank
surprise on the faces of bubbles and
red saunders when jess merrily met
his advances in utter sympathy

   safer than ever saunders laughed
noticing his friends glance besides

 want to talk to you on private affairs
and  cant do that here lets take a
look over the ground ourselves

  they were about to start accom-
panied by one islander when a whistle
from the hillside guard kohl halted
them through the night no sound had
come from either party dutch zim-
or the womans now it was dutch zim
in person with dan mallet who ap-
peared

  bosh pipe the pair o toughs try-
ing to look tender chuckled the skip-
per he stood his rifle against the post
of the platform and advised ruby to
do likewise the two men approaching
from the foothills appeared unarmed
their faces with grotesque results wore
expressions of conciliation dan mal-
let tough as an oak knot had the ap-
pearance of a gargoyle caught in a
smile zim smooth greasy blatant
looked exactly what he was-a dressed
hog posing as a human being with an
the human unpleasantness and none of
the piggy virtues

  what shall we do with the
blighters ruby wanted to know

  nothing so long as they behave if
they prove sassy though leave em to
me please

  zim halted twenty yards away and
hailed the camp
the redheads



  hew capn we wanit to have a
talk 

  nobodys preventing you retorted
saunders

  i know it but say wont yuh tell
yer wild man here to leave us come
through 

  kohl stood like a wooden image not
five yards away from dan mallet who
had been too slow to prevent him slip-
ping around to the farther side the
little savage possessed no weapon save
his murderous knife that blade which
lopped heads as easily as twigs and his
expression was only mildly ferocious
in fact he wore a jagged-toothed smile

 oh come ahead beauchamp
smiled encouragingly kohl wont eat
you-at least not until we give the
word

  zim and his companion sidled for-
ward ludicrously and stopped at the
posts of the hut their faces lighted
up a little at sight of the women and
the girls as if the feminine presence
gave proof of peace perhaps their ex-
perience in life lacked in some vital
particular any way they really seemed
to believe that

  what dye want snapped saun-
ders giving them no welcome

  aw capn yuh neednt be so
rough smiled dutch zim ingratiat-
ingly dans a good skate and dont
hold no grudge against yuh i dont
neither lets get together an see what
we kin do against this bunch up yonder
they want yer land mister beau-
champ he announced hurriedly turn-
ing to ruby in hope of seeing in his
face that hope which was denied him
in saunders

  by jovei exclaimed ruby fixing
his monocled stare on the greasy dutch-
man dyou know tve fancied some-
thing of the kind for a long time
have you two chaps by any chance
joined the salvation army he
drawled

  bpf

  dan mallet looked blankly at his
quizzer while dutch zim tried hard to
hold the half smile of greasy concilia-
tion he had brought with him saun-
ders grinned happily satisfied now that
ruby beauchamp was proving himself
worthy of his comradeship

  i dunno whatcher talkin about
mister but i aint no mans fool if
thats the tune o yer song dont get
gay boy mallet snarled the words
with hard breathing through his nose
dutch zim stuck an elbow into his
mates ribs viciously warning him to
siience it may be that mallet was still
sore at loosing that boxing champion-
ship and was still sorer now that he
saw for the first time his should-have-
been opponent wearing a monocle
saunders laughed aloud and a shade of
doubt flitted across mallets hard face
but he appeared to hold none of the
respect for beauchamp that he had ac-
quired for his late skipper and flung
off zims restraining hand

  say whats the joke he de-
manded belligerently shut up yuh
fat swab he snapped in answer to
zims frantic appeal for caution
whats all that guff mean mister he
persisted facing beauchamp with blaz-
ing eyes and clenched hands

  ruby smiled in utter happiness his
monocle dropped from his eye and was
flicked back over his shoulder to swing
by the ribbon he took a leisurely step
toward the raging sailor and like a
clamp of iron saunders hand fell on
his arm

  i said leave em to me the skipper
reminded him simply and said no more
until having taken mallet by the ears
with both hands thrust him backward
five paces pounded the back of his
hard head into dutch zims scowling
face and added the impetus of his good
right foot he uttered a parting admoni-
tion 

  talk quietly and straight if you
want to talk to me you pair of willies
peoples story magazine

and dont come here busting up the
peace and order of our camp or  
set a mongoose on to you scat now 

  there was one moment when zim
looked humble and pleading but ilia
desire to enlist on what seemed to
promise to be the winning side was not
strong enough to counteract his in-
grained currishness he shook a fist
backward fiercely striving to cast off
mallets urging hand

  i spoke yuh fair saunders i
spoke yuh fair yuh red sweep i was
willin to chip in along with yuh and
help euchre them crooks back there
now yer can go to ell the pair o yuh
and yer wimmcn yer times short
bullies watch dutch zim

  watch me too bawled mallet
savagely inoculated with the virus of
zims rage beauchamp started for-
ward aching to put just one balled fist
into each of those blatting mouths
red saunders stopped him with a sig-
nificant grin as kohl uttered a weird
piercing veil making his knife hash
and sing through the sunlit air like
an echo to the yell came another more
piercing still and out of the jungle
leaped tomking naked and unarmed
to creep with pantherish swiftness and
cunning movement after the retreating
outcasts

  dutch zim stood like a stricken ox
for ten seconds his arm fast held in
mallets right hand his free hand raised
in threat then his shining bestial face
paled seemed frozen in terror and his
flabby lips parted in a voiceless howl
like a scared rabbit he turned and
leaped for the hills careless of what
happened to mallet mouthing foolishly
as he went dan mallet paused for five
seconds longer then the frenzy seized
him too silently but as rapidly as
dutch zim went he left the camp and
headed for cover

  thatll do tomking called saun-
ders tomking came back with dis-
appointment written boldly on his ugly

lace die expression cleared in a mo-
ment

  youre right capn he said un-
smilingly the times hardly ripe yet
joe must be in on this

  tomking stepped back to his aban-
doned task in the jungle and saunders
picked up his rifle

  come on old chap he suggested
lets take that walk

  beauchamp followed him and to-
gether they strode through the tangled
bush for some distance until they
reached a stretch of open land which
simply reeked of petroleum where
verdure died but before they had a
chance to begin their examination of it
up from the camp pealed a scream-a
native womans scream-followed by a
chorused veil and a rifle shot

chapter xxl

  talk to you later grunted the
skipper picking up his rifle and starting
toward the camp

  at your service rejoined ruby
following suit and plunging ir pursuit
of red

  a scattering fusillade of gunshots
burst forth then the forest sank into
a momentary silence to awake imme-
diately to the clamor of native voices
and womens cries at the edge of the
camp clearing just out of sight of the
plat formed hut the two men butted
into a little group of three malays and
a seaman each regarding the other in
dumj accusation which ceased to be
dumb at sight of the skipper and his
comrade the sailor held in his hand
a bunch of cut ropes shaking them
fiercely in the faces of the malays

  whats the fuss  demandedsaun-
ders speaking directly to his seaman
who of all the others seemed least
rattled

  prisoner he got loose sar the man
replied with a frown

  saunders rapidly scrutinized the
the redheads



faces of the malays they were as
chagrined as the gilbert islanders but
the ropes had been cut without doubt
and that hinted at a traitor in camp
ruby beauchamp stepped forward to
assert his position as employer and de-
mand explanations in terms not at all
calculated to get results from scared
men when a distant feminine cry shrill
as a shriek yet not a shriek but rather
a ringing signal of distress uttered with
definite purpose came floating down
through the still air accompanied by
three pistol shots fired in swift succes-
sion

  by godfrey thats a signal from
the girls swore saunders and seizing
beauchamp by the arm he left his be-
wildered guards to their puzzle and
dragged the ruby one into the open

  beauchamp lie snapped jess
never sends that emergency cry except
in sore need look for tomking or
anybody who seems to have retained
his senses and bring him here quick

  saunders swarmed up the stout ladder
to the hut and saw in a single look
that it was empty the girls had been
visiting the malay women when he last
saw them and must surely have come
back to the hut when finished if only
to replace the unused physic in the
little house there was no sign of either
hurried departure or recent visitation
jess sweater pistol and sun hat lay
on her bunk the impedimenta of
bubbles was not there but saunders
recalled with a faint smile that
bubbles with her more recently ac-
quired camp wisdom always carried
her effects along with her if only mov-
ing from hut to stream

  from the platform the skipper ex-
amined the vast expanse of stony level
hillside and sweeping jungle through
his binoculars and the world lay bare
and secretive with a single leap he
regained the ground just as beauchamp
emerged from the riverside thicket
bringing with him a scowling seaman

who appeared more than loth to leave
the river

  whaffor missy beecham no let me
stay along the man cried catching
sight of his skipper pletty soon can
catch bad fella

  come here and tell me quickly
whats happened commanded saun-
ders sharply where are the lady
missies

  the islander gained coolness in the
presence of his well-loved skipper

  i telling you he said dam bad
fella lib along dere he pointed over
the stream and toward the hills
prisner he run me run too-all fella
run-catch look see at ribber den
plenty shootin an -the man shrugged
his broad shoulders helplessly-we
come back-no can see fella what run
away and missies gone

  who was shooting demanded the
skipper sharply not the runaways
no sar deni shots come from de
jungle first den from de hills den
from ober dere pointing to the rugged
hills to the southward saunders tried
to think it out ruby burst in with
by jove saunders it must be those
chaps who set fire to our stores back
yonder

  no doubt of it rejoined the skip-
per and there was a metallic note in
his voice his keen eyes twinkled in the
birth of that smile which meant ill for
his enemies and i deserve this
ruby for leaving the camp without a
real guard old tod carter would
never have let us down like this
wheres tomking and his cannibals
he snapped his fingers busily filling a
spare cartridge clip for his pistol

   i no see deni fella sar replied the
islander dolefully the skipper started
toward the hills with a whiplike back-
flung order

  get all the black pearls and trail
after us tell the malays to look after
themselves come on beauchamp 

  as they took the stony rise on the


peoples story magazine

dead run he grunted in answer to
rubys half-hearted objection

   im as careful as you can be of the
safety of folks working for me but
jess stands first

   by jove blurted out ruby strid-
ing along beside red  believe you
are the best chap in the world for
an adopted daughter you certainly show
extreme regard i respect you more
and more old top

  saunders almost stopped in his
tracks he stared hard at the ruby one
as they ran then a laugh of real amuse-
ment roared forth

  oh you thick loon he guffawed
and gave no heed to the flashing anger
of his comrade

   tomkings brother the previous day
had explained so accurately the situa-
tion of mrs rubens camp that saun-
ders went straight toward it it never
occurred to him to doubt for one
minute that the ravages of his own
camp had erupted thence and that the
girls would be found there if at all
just one thing bothered him however
and that was the absence of tomking
and his two comrades at such a time

  wishing with all his heart though
hopelessly that he had kept grim and
tried old tod carter with him instead
of sending him down the river the
angry skipper plunged forward through
a wild and dismal crack in the hills
selecting and keeping a trail with as
much certainly as if the girls had left
visible instructions beauchamp labored
along close to his shoulder

  night overtook them while yet in
the defile for as the dusk crept down
the valley the skipper began to feel
doubts regarding his direction as the
minutes passed and the ground rose
with still no trace of the recent passage
of the girls doubts were intensified

   they halted at last at the foot of a
cliff which soared like a wall at their
backs and here they flung themselves
down on a slab of mossy rock and en-

deavored to allay hunger with tobacco
the fragrant smoke tilled the silent eve-
ning like incense

  jewel its as dead and silent and
empty as an old tomb shuddered
beauchamp after five minutes of
hushed smoking

  getting on your nerves laughed
saunders quietly  thought the place
was full of small sounds listen to
that 

   a soft pattering as of tiny feet came
from overhead a pebble fell at their
feet between them then another deep
and awful silence ruby stared up at
the frowning rock wall seeing nothing
then came more soft pattering a sud-
den slipping of a heavy body on a
smooth incline and with a swift note
of warning to ruby saunders sprang
to his feet gun in hand and leaped
away from the wall beauchamp a
fraction slower felt the weight of a
world descend upon his head and shoul-
ders  the skipper buried yards away by
a similar impact recovered partially in
the smothering grip of three catlike
figures who handled themselves like
fighters and possessed a degree of
strength which forced upon the power-
ful seaman the conviction that he was
up against a serious dilemma

  this way beauchamp  he roared
and applied himself grimly to his assail-
ants

chapter xxii

  ruby beauchamp heard that shout
and laughed for all his ability to obey
the injunction he might as well have
been in java for out of the darkness
dropped silent figures that seemed pos-
sessed of wire sinews steam-driven
hands and the resistance of gorillas
his rifle hastily snatched up was
twisted out of his hands as one might
twist a stick from a willful child his
own determined forward movement
was barred with the immovability of
a masonry wall his fighting fists cap-
the redheads



able fists too were brushed aside and
their blows returned out of the dark-
ness by men who knew almost as much
as he knew of hand fighting-and there
were three against him at first with
more dropping apparently out of the
sky

  high up the cliff avail a light shone
out and the effect was not only weird
but conclusive proof of the keen cun-
ning of the leader of the band that had
assailed saunders and his companion
like a shaft of purest sunshine the
light came down  it flickered for barely
a second then rested first on the red
head of saunders battling like a greek
of thermopyhe then on the vermilion
poll of beauchamp -fighting as man-
full but with far less experience in
the tricks and methods of rough-and-
tumble

  from one to the other of those two
flaming heads the light beam wavered
otherwise it was steady as the rock
from which it flashed  and with eyes
blinded by the brilliance against foes
who fought determinedly and well with
the advantage of eyes free from that
appalling blaze beauchamp felt himself
going down under numbing blows and
with his last conscious breath he flung
out a panting roar

  saunders cut and run im done
save yourself for the girls-

  the skipper heard and grinned
through battered lips now it was he
who could neither cut and run nor help
his comrade beauchamps assailants
released by the ruby ones collapse
piled in like a living avalanche and now
there were uncounted opponents for
red to fight in the sudden onset of
the new foes he went to his knees and
the weight of three men bore down on
his broad back like a powder charge
under a rock he upheaved them and
for a brief breathing space stood free
of enwrapping arms then from the
vicinity of the searching light pealed a
hoarse savage voice

  stand clear the command was
followed by a shot and red saunders
stumbled and sank to the ground while
a sharp authoritative voice also near
the light called down curses on the
shooter and threatened him with
shivery penalties

  aw shut up retorted the bestial
tones of dutch zim  dye think i
want that guy to bust loose i done
what all yer swell toughs havent been
alble to do aint i 

  a glancing bullet which peeled a
furrow of red hair from his tough
skull had laid red saunders out to
all appearances in the glare of that
searching light he was out and done
for so grotesquely did the combination
of smeared blood and flaming hair
frame his dark face beauchamp
seemed to be in little better case al-
though no shot had reached him but it
was he who first opened his eyes and
fell into wonderment at his situation

  an intolerable feeling that his spine
was being broken in two speedily forced
ruby to make a extreme effort to see
just what was going on and soon the
monotonous thud under him at times
rhythmic at other times stumbling and
the giddy swaying first head down then
heels told him that he was slung face
upwards across the back of a small
pony his head on one side his feet on
the other and iris wrists burning
excruciatingly he knew by the strain
on them and the corresponding thug on
his heels were drawn under the beasts
belly he was as securely packed as a
bundle of camp kit and with about as
much consideration for his feelings

  otherwise im all right he grinned
to himself wondering what had hap-
pened to red for perhaps a mile he
lay in torture unable to catch a glimpse
of any other being human or brute
then a little ahead a commotion broke
out which soon resulted in bringing
him information

  another pony at first unseen snorted


peoples story magazine

violently and began to cut capers
sounds as of an incipient stampede
carried hack on the faint breeze and
then the pony squealed reared and
dashed madly back down the narrow
trail knocking men and beauchamp s
pony helter-skelter ruby felt himself
toppling over without the least power
of avoiding the fall or breaking it and
the next instant his knees and stomach
were thrust against the cliff while his
ponys legs shot from under him and
lie came down awkwardly

  amid yells and shouts fear anger
and bewilderment having their place in
the hubbub men ran to the fallen beast
with lights then at a sharp order the
light was carried at a run after the
runaway beauchamps pony struggled
violently for a short while then sub-
sided with a whinny of pain

  broken legs surmised the unwill-
ing mazeppa his own limbs and body
throbbed and ached from the ponys
frantic efforts to rise which had ground
and pounded the rider against the cliff
but now ruby found himself more or
less right side up on his knees with
his head forced backwards agonizingly
and the weight of the panting beast
across his legs down the defile the
shouts of the men rang and echoed and
dwindled away

  soon a warm heavy drop of rain
splashed noisily upon rubys upturned
face an appreciable interval passed
before another drop fell but when it
came it came in company and about
the same time as a shot rang out down
the trail the rainstorm broke in an
equatorial deluge

  in the first fury of the downpour
the ponys struggles kept beauchamp
bobbing about then the poor beast sub-
sided again to endlire physical pain and
probable drowning in dumb resigna-
tion but the moment motion ceased
rubys ability to dodge the torrent went
with it and now the breath was driven
out of him by the sheer force of the

water falling on nose and mouth to
add to his troubles the lashings with
which he was fastened began to tighten
under the saturation

  ah sound ceased along the gully ex-
cept the roar and swish of water and
ravaged cliffside jungle slowly in-
evitably the floor of rhe narrow ravine
was covered with a rapidly running
stream a trickle first then a brook
a rivulet a river and the water ran
into the stricken ponys nostrils into
its mouth driving the already frantic
beast mad with terror

  bits of bush debris began to swirl
past twigs loose leaves branches then
small bushes entire with earth at the
roots the pony had ceased struggling
its legs were covered with matted
flotsam beauchamp felt die waters
about his own knees and dully calcu-
lated how long it would take to reach
his chin then the pony roused to
make a last dying protest against fate
and toppled over the other way as it
gasped its last breath away

  dimly through the darkness as his
head was plunged under the water
ruby caught sight of a lighter patch
on the black wall of the night sweep-
ing past him on the flood in a shapeless
mass then lie was submerged and
the dead pony rolled over legs out of
water and started to float down with
the other debris of the apj ailing down-
pour

  just as his soul seemed hammering
at his lips for exit a snag of rock or
splintered timber hitched in his foot
lashings and held him submerged still
deeper for what seemed eternity
still he fought against the longing to
open his mouth and invite death hss
stubbornness met with the reward it
deserved for he felt a dull snapping
sensation at his wrist one hand came
free and his dead carrier rolled slug-
gishly over again held against the cur-
rent by the obstacle but leaving the
mans face clear of the water
the redheads



  with lungs that felt as if stripped
raw he gulped in great drafts of
new life lying still as a mouse lest his
uncertain craft turn turtle again
then with tenderest caution he groped
with his free hand for the obstacle that
had proved sharp enough to sever at
least one strand of his rope his arm
was free only from elbow to wrist and
his radius of action was limited but
in parting from his wrist the rope left
hi right ankle less tightly bound and
his toes got a slight very slight lever-
age on earth or something which at
least felt like earth more solid and
supporting thaii the rushing waters

  with a free hand and a foot not free
but possessing a little sphere of move-
ment ruby groped and sought for a
means of release

  presently his foot caught in some
enwrapping impediment and at the
same moment his fingers fastened in a
mass of cloth or canvas tugging and
kicking tearing fingernails and all but
breaking his tortured ankle he slowly
raised above water the ventilating cap
of a tent with cords and pole still
attached it was not at once that he
knew what he had found he kept right
on working and something like a cheer
burst from his laboring throat when he
dragged up above water the lower end
of the tent pole shod with a sharp
four-sided iron spike six inches long

  just as good as old tomkings bally
knife by jove he grinned and went
dourly to work on his lashings

chapter xxiii

  the cause of all ruby beauchamps
troubles was a wandering cobra the
fiendish mind tha conceived the idea
of driving beauchamp and saunders
away by means of venomous snakes had
overlooked two things the uncertainty
of any snakes voluntary movements
and the possibility of the carriers of the
snakes becoming dissatisfied with their
employers

  to the latter event tomking con-
tributed largely though unobtrusively
and dutch zim had also helped perhaps
more largely hoping to be one to profit
by the change the cobras had been
turned loose in the ravine instead of
on beauchamps territory and the
squirming brutes had scattered

  one had crossed the gully in the
darkness no doubt seeking a snug lodg-
ing for the night and the pony bearing
saunders trussed up as beauchamp
was stepped on the scaly tail it was
the lightninglike wrapping of snaky
coils about his leg and the deadly
poisonous fang stroke that sent the
little pony squealing back over the trail
the snake clinging tight and striking
until flicked to ribbons by the mad
gallop

 saunders experienced a madder
mazeppa ride than ever ruby suffered
for the maddened beast he was tied on
kicked and swerved in the futile effort
to fling off that clammy horror and
the poison taking effect the faster as
the blood leaped through the animals
veins to its furious gallop gave to the
motion a frenzied delirium which
barely left the wounded skipper con-
scious then came the final stumble
and fall the running up of men the
swift expert examination and the
merciful shot and not until then did
anybody deign to look at the human
being lying helpless beneath the dead
pony

  with the breath knocked out of him
by that dying fall saunders lay quiet
panting deeply his muscles tensed in
the tremendious effort to refrain from
groaning under the weight upon him
a light was flashed in his face shining
into his open glassy eyes and a curt
irritable voice gave an order

  cut him adrift some of you look
for shelter its beginning to rain and
that means stop right here

  with every inch of his body a tor-
ture the skipper permitted himself to


peoples story magazine

be dragged to his feet then he waited
for the next development unarmed
weak and dazed but indomitable as
clarity returned and his bodily discom-
forts diminished to the point where he
could ignore them his mitid which had
never wavered from the problem of the
girls disappearance was capable oi
pondering his own present problems a
well the men who had first captured
him transported him and now released
him had left him on a low ledge of
crumbling stone and he could hear
them above and around him their
voices calling to each other indicating a
measure of apprehension and an eager-
ness for shelter

  and the rain came down as it had
upon ruby beauchamp in sheets and
flurries and torrents in the blackness
the skipper groped about him in the
desperate hope that he might drop his
hand on some weapon perhaps laid
aside while the owner joined in the
search for high and dry shelter he
found nothing and the voices had
ceased like a flash of light the
thought came to him that he had been
left alone in his captors anxiety it
was a moments work to lower himself
on the ledge until his foot swung clear
try as he might forward back and
straight down he could not touch one
small hold which promised him a foot-
ing he moved along the ledge reach-
ing upwards with the same futility
but at knee height by accident he
felt another narrower ledge which
seemed to extend without limit and to
this he climbed holding his breath lest
he overbalance and tumble into that
lower blackness the real depth of - hich
he did not know

  before he had straightened up to his
full height a cold blade of steel touched
his throat like the cold finger of death
out of a well of infernal blackness
involuntarily he choked back a gasp
and his hand flew up to catch the blade
the point was pressed and he felt the

steel pierce the skin a rusty warning
came like the hissing of team

  dont move stay where you are
unless you want to be stuck like a
soor

  without a sound in reply swift as
the stroke of a cobra saunders brought
up his other hand seized the naked
blade at his throat and wrenched it
down almost with the same move-
ment his free hand slipped along the
weapon along the bare arm beyond
and reached for the unseen throat of
his adversary his strong fingers
closed around a throbbing windpipe
which was as swiftly released by the
merit of thick oil on a tough skin cover-
ing a neck that felt like solid muscle

  out of the darkness sneaked a long
arm again seeking for a hold on the
skipper and the two men unseen to
each other hearing only the crunch of
broken stone the panting of each
others breath and the swishing of the
rain came to grips on that ribbonlike
foothold and fought silently

  whoever you are youre a sport
anyhow panted red and with the
compliment hurled himself forward
blindly gathered the man in his great
arms and threw him the next mo-
ment still without a cry the pair were
rolling over the ledge into the unknown
depths so suddenly that the surprise
jarred more than the fall they crashed
into a dwarf pepper bush through it
and out into a foot-deep pool of water
and the moment they ianded unhurt
except for scratches the skipper heard
with utter amazement

  you should have spoke before
capn i nearly jabbed the steel into
you

  tomking why you ugly lummox
what are you doing here

tomking caught reds arm dragged
him a little way up the ravine and led
him to a high round piece of rock 
never mind about lummoxes now
remarked tomking good for you the
the redheads

luinmox wasnt bang or kohl theyd
ha stuck first and warned afterwards
i heard yer voice just in time thats
good

  but what were you doing up there

on guard over me unless-

  dont say it capn interrupted
tomking sharply i know how you
feel but i got feelings too and reasons
remember i wasnt guardin you and
i wasnt exactly lookin to find you
there i slipped the knife into your
guard if thats what the chap was
and i though you were just another of
em no i havent done you dirt
capn dont ever think it again
impulsively the skipper gripped
tomkings hand and a new sense of
respect came with the grip there had
been moments when he had doubted the
man and his two savage comrades but
in the future there could be no more
doubts

  sorry old chap i apologize mur-
mured red awkwardly but what do
you know i wonder whats happened
to beauchamp

  last i heard of him was that he was
smashed under his pony thought
voud want to know about the young
ladies

  i do man i do i want to know
that every individual in the bunch is
safe but i know that beauchamp
ought to be near here alive or dead i
need him if alive

  cant teh you that capn i can
tell you the ladies are safe so far at
least

  where

  that i dont know since the rain
started they were carried off on
ponies and taken farther up this ravine
to the main camp of the crooks any-
thing may have happened to the camp
but nothing will harm the ladies yet
they seemed to be popular right away
with the younger men of the crowd
come  snapped saunders slip-
ping down from the rock into knee-

deep water well look for beau-
champ first if hes alive hell be in-
terested in what youve told me

  their first steps brought the skipper
and tomking into sore trouble from
knee-deep the water grew to waist-high
and added to the difficulties of unstable
footing and swift current was the in-
creasing amount of wreckage hurtling
down the ravine trees dead thing
masses of grass sward tangled into
heavy rafts by the intricate roots all
hurled themselves against the two men
as if discharged with deadly purpose
by an implacable enemy at one step
the skipper lost his footing and was
carried away on the flood grabbing
tomkings arm as he stumbled and
taking him along too both men re-
covered but not until the roaring
stream had carried them across to the
other side of the ravine and planted
them with a thump against something
yielding out of which issued strange
sounds

  by jove what a bally lark i
say who the devil are you chaps eh 
you knocked the confounded wind out
of me yknow

  ruby roared saunders groping
with both hands until he found beau-
champs wet face and from that his
hand

  oh its you eh returned ruby
with a bored note i say old chap
try and untie me theres a good fellow
ive been saw in away at these bally
ropes for half an hour and havent cut
one damned string confound this
moisture anyhow it plays old goose-
berry with things

  before he ceased chattering tomking
had deftly passed his keen knife
through the lashings and dead pony
tent pole and ropes sailed away into
the desolate shadosws below it re-
quired but a few sentences for saun-
ders to detect a slight note of extreme
exhaustion approaching hysteria in
beauchamps courageously assumed in-

difference he spoke to tomking and
together they hauled ruby clear of the
water and up on to dry ground a
swift search of his own clothes brought
to light the skippers flask which with
his little medicine kit seemed alone to
have escaped his captors as it hap-
pened the brandy proved more useful
than arms just at the moment for it
put life and new courage into three
chilled hungry and apparently hope-
less men

  rested inquired the skipper after
a while

  oh quite laughed beauchamp
tomking grunted assent

  how high are we above the level of
our camp tomking saunders asked
thoughtfully he had been on the point
of moving but paused

  about fifty feet i spose any-
way before this is over there wont be
any camp left down there replied
tomking with a grim chuckle may
not be any camp left up here where
were bound for unless theyve shifted
it higher than theyre likely to this
is the rain ive been expecting but was
afraid it was missing us this year if

mister carter has started his dam-

he broke off laughing

  carter isnt a fool retorted red
he wont start to build a water barrier
on a rising river with his tools t was
thinking about the malay women how
about them

  wouldnt your seamen go back
when they met this flood inquired
ruhy anxiously the suggestion that
those helpless malay women and kid-
dies might be in deadly peril made him
shiver

  hardly and im not so sure the
women would have the sense to get
their food stores into the trees before
too late these are plains people and
not used to this sort of washout
where are your battaks tomking
he suddenly asked gripping the man in
the darkness

  looking out  can call em at any-
time though

  then call one now send him down
to help the malays and tell him to come
back when the outfit is safe and stored
against famine

  tomking cupped his hands and out
across the roaring storm pealed the call
his men knew it pierced tin- elemental
hubbub like a bugle call rings through
a silence three times it was repeated
then came an answer far away it
seemed up the gully ten minutes
passed then out of the gloom glided
kohl announcing himself by name to
tomking the little cannibal appeared
quite able to see the others for he went
direct to his own master ignoring the
skipper and ruby his orders under-
stood he grunted once it might have
been either in satisfaction chagrin or
indifference then he pushed past and
was ffone

  by jove what a lot of bally mat-
ting the chap carries round him ejacu-
lated beauchamp saunders laughed
with a low curse of disgust behind the
laugh

  i felt em too he said the little
devils been out head-lopping again

chapter xxiv

  a sudden lull in the downpour let
the watery stars wink out and tomking
led the way across the narrow gully
in the faint radiance of the stars but
slightly increased by a shamefaced
moon the scene lay bleak and dispirit-

ins

  lets get over while we can
growled saunders they stepped across
by means of heaps of debris using dead
and living alike as necessity demanded
for stepping stones and they were
but midway up the steep ascent when
the torrent broke again in redoubled
fury hurled down and along on the
breath of a terrific wind-squall which
brouglut terrors which were absent be-
the redheads



fore and were now utterly unnecessary
to render the picture terrifying

  cant stand against this capn
gasped tomking turning his sturdy
back to the appalling blast the rain
beat upon his bare back with the lash
of whips the skipper and beauchamp
clothed in stout khaki knew by the
pitiless pelting on faces and hands what
tlie man must be enduring they had
ruby particularly followed tomkings
lead without question unwilling to de-
cline any hazard he was willing to take
and even saunders storm-hardened
and anxious as he was to prosecute
their search realized that it was more
than human beings could battle against

  youre right i guess dye know
of any hole we can squeeze into

  tomking found one a shallow com-
paratively dry cave which chanced to
open to leeward into this the three
men squeezed and tried to suck com-
fort out of wet pipes filled with satu-
rated tobacco which damp matches re-
fused to light

  the rain fell on the just and the un-
just exactly in accordance with the
ancient proverb and the camp of mrs
rubens was in a bad way when the
first trickle of water ran down the
ravine the major experienced in the
country insisted upon striking camp
and moving to the high ground twice
before morning broke with every warn-
ing of a prolonged downpour the camp
was moved higher into the hills until
at last it seemed as if a safe site had
been reached

  apart from the effects of the storm
there was an air of unrest in the camp
and in the hissing gloom within the
leaiking tents much whispering was go-
ing oil jess and bubbles crouched
close together in a corner of the big
tent watching with bright eager eyes
the major and mrs rubens trying
with every faculty to hear what was
said

  now do you believe that i was right
about zim the woman was saying
you ought to have grabbed him and
shot his thick head off when he sneaked
in on us

  im not so sure sara retorted the
major but his tone was not very de-
cided you say zims scared by this
saunders chap anyhow hes brought
in a husky fellow in mallet and if they
were scared they didnt show it greatly
when they started off last night to bring
in saunders and his associate

  hell never survive meeting them
cried bubbles angrily jess grasped
her hand and whispered caution

  ah you there laughed the major
swinging around with a start i had
forgotten you ladies

  youll remember us as long as you
live retorted bubbles you dont
expect that greasy pig zim to capture
captain saunders or mr beauchamp
do you he couldnt do it with an
army and if you dont know what
the captain did to mallet youd better
ask your crooked sports from palem-
bang

  the major regarded bubbles with
amusement and admiration the angry
girl stood facing him a very picture of
righteous rage jess rose from her seat
and stood -beside her chum just as
brave as she though less explosive by-
reason of greater experience in mrs
rulbens eyes blazed a demon of jealous
fury for she saw the admiration in her
majors face deepen and soften

  dont waste time and breath on the
hussy she cried here outside
there a sentry entered sulkily
dripping wet and miserable guard
take this girl in to blums tent

  the man stepped outside called a
name or two and came back with two
companions who advanced unwillingly
upon the furious girl

  better go bubbles theres no
chance for us in here and you may be
able to get hold of a pistol in there


peoples story magazine

jess whispered hurriedly in her ear
bubbles gave no sign of having heard
she fought desperately with the men
and loyally jess flew to her sile but
the men were too strong they tore the
girls apart and bubbles was rushed out
into the roaring storm and across to the
smaller tent occupied by rivi and
corny and blum

  into this they pushed her and she
stood trembling in the semidarkness
listening to the thunder of rain on can-
vas peering around ready to leap upon
the owner of the tent and rend him

  out of the gloom came a startled
oath then a chuckle of bestial gratifica-
tion a match was struck and applied
to a hanging lantern for the interior
of the tent was as a room at night in-
stead of a canvas structure in broad
day and as her eyes penetrated the
shadows bubbles saw the lounging
form of corny on a pile of blankets
and the upright leering shape of blum
beside the tent-pole

  shes mine i saw her first cried
corny springing to his feet

  i poot a het on ju foorst growled
blum savageh she vas mine py
got

  suddenly all her nervous trembling
ceased and bubbles felt a wave of cold
determination surge over and through
her to be accepted by such men as a
piece of cattle as a chattel perhaps
snatched her back from mad anger to
sanity she stood silently regarding the
men waiting and hoping for a chance
to step near that tent-pole on which
hung two pistol belts with open holsters

  im play you euchre for her offered
corny smiling at the girl with what
was supposed to be an expression of
keen cunning

  takes too long py got objected
blum leering at bubbles fiendishly
take a penny i toss oop

  loser gets right out o here

  ja come vot iss the coin spun
upwards

  tails cried corny

  the coin fell on the ground and both
men dived greedily forward to see the
result

  it  het py got und shes mine
yelled blum

  with the swift certainty of a jungle
cait bubbles sprang forward thrust
with all her might at the bending figure
of corny and drove him violently
against the groping shoulders of blum
the men went to the floor in a swear-
ing heap and like a flash bubbles
snatched down a belt and seized a pistol
covering them with the weapon she
slipped the belt about her neck and
took down the other one

  jess oh jess she screamed and
her voice carried through the storm
like a trumpet call through die din of
battle

  yerdamt cat swore blum stum-
bling to his feet and making a clumsy
dive to grapple the girls knees

  quick as light she fired and made
no mistake in her aim the bullet took
blum scjuarely in the breast and he
pitched headlong coughing as corny
made his leap and jess burst in through
the tent flap streaming with rain her
hair flying loose but ready for action

  bubbles fired again and corny
stopped looking foolish gripping one
arm with the other in the momentary
respite before the interruption she knew
nuust come from outside as a resuit of
those shots bubbles took off a belt
flung it to jess and took the leadership
as naturally as if to the manner born

  come on jess she cried well
get out and find shelter somewhere until
the rain stops then well go back to
the camp

  out into the pelting rain they ran
dimly aware that two astonished figures
stood within the remnant of the big
tent peering out the peremptory
tones of the major and the shriller
more vindictive voice of the woman
hurtled out across the wild spaces call-
the redheads



ing their men while the suddenly found
voice of corny added to the din and
apprised the leaders of blums swift
fate and the girls daring escape

  which way gasped bubbles be-
wildered by the fierce thrashing of the
teeming rain which snatched the breath
from them both

  if we can slip over the ravine edge
jess screamed back almost blinded her
long hair flying and wrapping its drip-
ping coils about her face

  stop them yelled corny aroused
to thoughts of vengeance as if in
answer came a shot from the tent and
a bullet exploded a cartridge in jess
belt

  here over quick she panted
seizing bubbles by the dress blindly
they sat down on the edge of the chasm
and commended themselves to a kindly
fate as they slid over beside and all
about them poured the water it had
burrowed out a sluice in the softer
earth  leaving two buttocks of rock
which formed a narrow roofless
tunnel into this the girls cowered
each with a pisitol held in readiness
and with sobbing breath waited for the
attack they knew must come

  the sluicing water drenched them as
they crouched the slanting sheets of
falling rain stung their faces like hail
and as if the very heavens were de-
termined to bring about their downfall
a great boulder slipped and tumbled
across their refuge under the force of
undermining water as corny stumbled
to the edge followed byr half a dozen
men and began shooting into the nar-
row crevice with the merciless coldness
of deliberate murder

chapter xxv

  a fast-flying cloud uncovered the
sun for an instant and the rain dimin-
ished until it was no more than a heavy
shower but the storm was not by any
means over the cloud passed urged

forward by a heavier mass of scudding
vapor and from the frowning crest of
ophir rumbled the voice of thunder
to presently crack with a splitting
volley overhead

  there had been no noticeable flash of
lightning that had spent itself beyond
the cloud veil but the terrific peal of
thunder coming as it did coincident
with the recommencement of the teem-
ing rain surprised three separate bodies
of men in as many different attitudes
and the most dazzling of lightning
flashes could scarcely have rendered
the tableaux more dramatic

  a cry had warned the men with
corny that something was happening
and they stood irresolute after firing a
single harmless volley into the girls
shelter they stood on the brink of
the chasm streaming water their faces
showing the dislike they felt for the
job they were called to farther along
beyond the camp marched another
band a strange-appearing party who
seemed possessed of some tremendous
impulse which mocked at storms and
from the midst of this party arose two
strenuously objecting voices one curs-
ing and threatening with a mans
vigor the other pleading threatening
reviling by turns in the note of a cur

  steadily the band inarched and
halted at the main tent six stalwart
indian hillmen and three scowling white
men in a sort of uniform hustled be-
tween them the protesting figures of
dutch zim and dan mallet to halt
them before the threatening form of
sara the major stood beside her a
frown deepening upon his stern face

  well  the woman snapped the
single word her burning gaze fixed
upon zim

  aw sara tell these guys to turn us
loose yelled zim and fear sat heavily
upon him we done dll-

  you did nothing results-show
results 

  dan mallet started to speak a vivid


peoples story magazine

flash of lightning seemed to leap fn ni
tlie clouds within reach of their head
in a second the crashing report of
thunder deafened the ears then as
swiftly as the lightning almost the inst
heavy cloud passed over the sun ihe
rain ceased and a hush fell on the
earth

  and the first clear rays of still
watery sunshine dhone full on a pair
of flaming redheads creeping up over
the edge of the ravine abreast of the
camp and but fifty yards distant from
where the girls crouched abreast of
the redheads creeping as swiftly came
a line of frizzy gilbert island heads
and flanking the line at one end was
the grotesque visage of tomking now
utterly natural devoid of paint or
chalk at the other end the little monkey
face of bang grinning as he cuddled
the wicked blade of a knife which was
streaked with stains not all due to rust

  i tell yuh we got em-theyre both
croaked yelled zim frantically
theyre both down the ravine dead
as mutton saunders and the monocled

guv

  as in answer came the terrific howl
that burst from cornys throat as bang
crawled over the top and stood fair in
view at the little mans waist swung
four gory heads and one a ghastly
thing of features frozen in a snarl of
murderous hate was the head of rivi
cornys chum

  and next after the horrid little fore-
runner stepped the erect figures if
saunders and beauchamp backed at
last by the crew of the black pearl
who had doubled after them and armed
again with tools which put them on
even terms with any two men living

  they were the dead men not a
moment before they had been reported
definitely out of the way they ap-
peared to give zim the lie before the
lying words were fairly out of his
mouth a shrill scream of fur- pealed
from the woman and her pistol flashed

and crashed within a yard of zims
head but another eye had watched
and had forestalled her joe tomkitigs
brother wanted zim for other pur-
pn-es he yelled as the woman fired
and her aim went wide before she
could tire again joe leaped forward
and flung zim to the ground and in
the same breath another shape leaped
into the circle and faced the woman
it was tomking and as they faced
each other the man and the woman in
an awful silence the men around them
with all their divergent motives their
various impulses their differing degrees
of susceptibility stood still perforce
awed to silence by the terrific sense of
impending catastrophe which hung over
them

  the face of the woman blanched her
great eyes glittered and stared into
tomkings eloquent face like the eyes
of a bird before a hungry snake her
breast heaved tremendously and a
quiver racked through her her full
lips no longer scarlet or alluring
uttered one word

  you r

  me the man uttered in response
and with a hand as remorseless as a
steel claw he reached out seized her
wrist and drew her toward him while
a shriek of panic pealed from her
throat

  instantly the conflicting elements in
the picture merged in terrific battle
joe dragged dutch zim aside clear of
the rest and corny rendered furious
by the sight of his comrades dead face
forgot the girls in the hollow and fired
at saunders his men seeing in tlie
swift action of joe the act of a traitor
to their mistress pelted him with shot
and advanced firing steadily upon the
skipper and his crew

  tlie major leaped to saras side and
in his expression was that which
showed he had caught the note of
tragedy in the meeting with tomking
as he reached her bang leaped behind
the redheads



kirn and sprang upon his back knife
ready with a bound saunders pre-
vented the threatened stroke for he
wanted to talk to the major later
tomking drew the woman inexorably
after him and the major relieved of
the immediate peril of bangs steel ran
to her aid

  and across the swamped steaming
plain swayed a swiftly joined conflict
the mixed gang who had brought in
zim and mallet seemed to hesitate but
cornys men saw only the danger to
themselves and flung themselves furi-
ously upon the black pearls grim
crew

  around the struggling woman the
fight centered the major responding
to her frenzied cries strove to drag her
away from tomking who as tenacious-
ly persisted in his purpose the skip-
per and beauchamp ignoring the gen-
eral melee keeping aloof in spite of the
flying lead sought for the girls whom
they knew were there but of whom
there was no sign already there was
a splitting up of combatants into
separated knots as if the men of the
camp found small relish in their work
the islanders like their skipper ap-
peared bent on search rather than
slaughter but fought stoutly so long as
foes sprang up before them

  in addition the holding aloof of the
hindus and their three white com-
rades was something to remark and
when tomking finally dragged sara to
her feet at the very edge of the ravine
forcing her to face him the fighting
suddenly dropped into a lull in which
every eye was turned toward the little
scene being enacted only the major
refused to be held by the grip of it
loyally however mistakenly he was
bent on saving sara from what ap-
peared inevitable fate drawing his
pistol now for the first time he sprang
forward again and presented the
weapon at tomkings head again
bang leaped to his back beating the

pistol down but too late to prevent the
unforeseen result of the majors action

  tomking swinging sara behind him
stepped back before the threat of the
pistol shot and the crumbling edge of
the chasm broke under their weight
there was a swift outflinging of hands
a shriek and a plunge into the yawning
pit and before the clods of earth
had ceased to fall while yet men
crowded at the brink to peer over in
awed silence into the thick of the
crowd plunged joe dragging dutch
zim after him like a sack of wool his
face set and grim as he glared in search
of his brother

  sounds neither words nor cries
rather like the moaning of a beast
stricken to death issued from joes lips
the fat face of zim was ashen and
flabby-horrible his eyes glared
glassily and with the strength of
madness joe picked him up gripping
him by the flesh of his neck and bore
him back until he overhung the broken
edge of the precipice

  upon the hush broke a cry distant
muffled and surprising the skipper
and ruby tuned as they were for such
sounds leaped toward the source of
that cry joyously and as they uttered
their own yell of assurance to the girls
whose voices they knew quite well men
turned in alarm to follow them with
their eyes

  then rose another chorused tre-
mendous yell which brought every man
to the rightabout to stare at the near-by
pony track issuing from the mountains
onto the plain where sat the camp
even saunders stopped and ruby
halted in his search for the owner of
that muffled cry

  hi old billy runacres yelled
the skipper waving a hand and imme-
diately plunging forward again in
search of jess they had located the
source of the cry and presently found
the boulder which prevented the girls
escape but before they had time to


peoples story magazine

move it a new cry rang out and again
they turned to see

  there was no longer a -struggle on
the edge of the ravine every man who
had been looking on now stood staring
at the pony trail the precipice brim
was bare at last joe and zim had
finished their struggles but in the
front of the crowd glaring at the pass
stood the major pistol at his side

  with runacres who was grinning
broadly and waving a roll of parchment
or stout paper rode a stout red-laced
military officer in the imperial dutch
uniform whose bearing spoke of high
authority it was upon him that the
majors staring eyes were fixed for
a moment the major stood lips parted
face drawn in haggard shame then
with the single exclamation com-
mandant  he raised his pistol and sent
a bullet into his own brain as the officer
spurred his horse and galloped for-
ward

  in another moment runacres was
stooping with red and ruby lifting
away the rock from the girls prison

chapter xxvi

  a higii noon sun blazed down upon
a sodden earth drawing the moisture
up in shimmering steam and bringing
flocks of chattering parrakeets and
droves of monkeys from the recesses of
the jungle to the whispering treetops
of the open a small body of native
netherlands troops under the direction
of the commandant who was speedily
satisfied of the duplicity of the major
had herded together the scowling rem-
nants of the small army of land pirates
and they were already marching over
the mountain trails toward fort de
kock

  then thats ali settled runacres
asked when the officer gave back to
him the papers he had been perusing

  everything seems correct mynheer
mr beauchamps title should never

have been disputed and  shall see that
the kempees  van zoom rascals are
properly dealt with it was necessary
for me to send the body of that
wretched suicide in to the fort because
the man betrayed his high commission
and his shame shall not be concealed by
me but as for the woman well-

  the officer concluded with an elo-
quent wave of the hand then with
a formal sailute he turned his ponys
head and cantered auay after his men
leaving jess and bubbles at the camp
the men followed beauchamp and the
skipper down the declivity in search of
tomking

  here comes old tod carter at a
dead run ruby wonder byr what
mysterious means he was persuaded
that we might need him up here hes
late anyhow and hell be mad as a
hatter

  he certainly looks as if hes
marched for days without a halt
grinned runacres shading his eyes the
better to distinguish the mates party

  carter was not yet within hail when
a queer noise at the foot of the cliff
brought the searchers down running
no living thing was to be seen only
a faint and vanishing sound of rustling
scrub gave evidence of some presence
near

  here bang the skipper called in-
tending to send the little cannibal out
scouting no bang replied nobody
appeared the men began to scatter
tearing aside the bushes and parting
the broad leaves of pandanus and
banana and soon a yell and a hurried
exodus of a knot of scared islanders
from the thicket brought saunders and
ruby to the spot half aware of what
they were to see

  can we come down the girls
called from above eagerly scenting
some vital discovery in the sudden ac-
tivity below

  no yelled saunders vehemently
the redheads



dont venture one step nearer here
jess for gods sake

  at first sight it seemed as if the
alarm was unnecessary in the midst
of a patch of trampled soaked earth
lay the body of joe and upon his
breast partly covering his poor bruised
head was a great crimson banana
flower but joe was dead a few
yards away they came upon the broken
corpse of tomking and upon his breast
too lay a great crimson flower

  thats not accidental surely mut-
tered beauchamp in a hushed voice

  quite certain its not rejoined the
skipper then smothering a curse he
added with outflung hand neither is
that

  huddled beneath a broken banana
plant the bodies of dutch zim and
sara rubens lay and they were not
laid out straight like the others here
too were great crimson patches but of
far different sort here were no gor-
geous banana flowers laid there by
reverent hands but that which caused
saunders to abruptly drag his comrade
away

  get busy you fellows and bury
those things he ordered harshly
put tomking and joe together de-
cently cover up the others somehow

ugh r

  silently he and ruby walked toward
the narrow path down which tod car-
ter was hurrying and in a few minutes
they were gripping the shaking hands
of the old seaman

  what are you going to do nowr
inquired billy runacres over a hastily
spread and sparsely furnished lunch
cloth he lightened the monotony of
eating tinned beef by watching the ex-
pressions of his companions particu-
larly the faces of bubbles and ruby
beauchamp from time to time a slow
shrewd smile wrinkled his eyes and
lips he nodded gravely when he inter-
cepted a swift glance of dawning won-

 bpeo

der which beauchamp flashed at the
unconscious skipper and jess who were
much closer together than usual betel
bob the fijian steward of the black
pearl hovered over the doth in ludi-
crous apology for the poorness of the
spread no one noticed him however
except tod carter whose appetite was
proof against any poorness in the foods
quality so long as the quantity was
right

  theres only one thing to do re-
plied the skipper -with a laugh rubyrs
stores and equipment have suffered
badly there is plenty of water in the
river now you mean to carry on
dont you beauchamp

  of course wed be fools to have
gone through all this messy business to
quit after all

  	then i suggest we leave the balance
of our gear up at our old camp with
the laborers in charge of a couple of
my sailors the malays well take
back to their village and pick em up
again when we come back we can
make use of our boats now carter
says and that means we can get down
to the schooner in a day or so she
can be raised in six hours and when
we come back therell be no need to use
any more tricks like that youd better
carry the gold dust weve washed into
palembang ruby and buy stores with
it you ought to take a decent fortune
out of your land in a year

 perhaps rejoined beauchamp
thoughtfully he glanced at the girls
and remarked anyhow old chap
well get down to work seriously now
and first of all let me say tha it will
be better if we leave the ladies behind
next time

  bubbles got up without a word stuck
her pretty nose into the air and walked
off the picture of lady disdain jess
watched her friend go and smiled
then she shook her head at ruby and
objected

 cant be done my friend you
peoples story magazine

cant separate me from my reckless
hub by

  rubys monocle dropped with a clink
his mouth opened and snapped shut
like a gasping fish

  by jove hubby did you say
saunders laughed long and deeply  i
say old chap you led me to suppose

jess was your adopted-

  not so fast kubv grinned the
skipper that was your own leap at
conclusions as a matter o fact
though we have preferred to keep our
own secret t adopted jess as my wife
a year ago

  vnd you cant separate us ruby
beauchamp laughed jess

  anyhow good people i wont bring
miss muriel vincent next time ruby
asserted and marched off toward the
ravine path down which bubbles had
gone

  ruby plunged through a cane brake
and came upon bubbles sitting with
her chin on her hand gazing at the
distant hoary crest of ophir she gave
no sign that she was aware of his
presence and he on his part gave her
back in kind without preamble he
squatted down beside her grinned in
her face and said sharply

  bubbles were going to start in a
minute or two thought id ask you
to come to my wedding comes off as
soon as i can get a parson

  the girl stared at him then her small
freckled nose rose in the air again and
she stood up

  im sure im not interested in your
wedding mr beauchamp she said
as for attending it-id--rather-at-
tend-your f-funeral like a deer

she broke into a run and vanished
fumbling for her handkerchief rubv
plunged after like a football tackle and
overtook her in a very few strides

  here i say bubbles dont blubber
be urged distractedly cant you
understand when a fellows spoofin  
say now dont you see if you wont
accept the invitation there cant be any
bamy weddin yknow here be a

sport-

  saunders and billy runacres were
still grinning over rubys amazement
when a softly smiling jess raised a
finger to force their attention ruby
and bubbles appeared hand in hand
wearing a fine air of nonchalance

  ha changed your mind eh
ruby cried jess you wont leave
poor muriel vincent behind next trip
will you

  indeed he will laughed bubbles
impudently

  er-yes dear old things drawled
ruby affecting indifference to the
glances thrown at him i rather think
this is no place for misses of any de-
scription i shall bring bubbles beau-
champ though and make no secret of
the relationship he concluded with an
exaggerated bow toward jess and red

  for that dig i shall insist on marry-
ing you people on board my schooner
the moment we get outside the river
the skipper smiled softly

  old tod carter hovering by for
orders stalked away in haste he knew
the signs growling deep in his throat
but with a whimsical smile in his keen
eyes he marshaled his men for the
first leg of the journey down to where
the real story of bubbles and ruby
beauchamp was to begin

dutch and blue find themselves in the midst of football activities
and there is much carnage spiced with romance   

romance is like a game o foot-
ball th harder yu charge th
more stubborn is resistance an-
other point in common is that they both
incline to end up in a fight never
havin studied a rule book on either i
cant be certain whether a battle is pre-
scribed in th regulations or is just bv
personal agreement between th con-
testin parties

  since th time when blue danube
an me were th storm centers so t
speak in both-an all at th same time
-i cant observe a football game with-
out wonderin firsthow many ro-
mantical complications are involved t
whenever i note a couple players square
off for hostilities i think maybe
theres some girl on th side lines that
is th cause for action rathern a diff-
rence of opinion about th game itself
an th second wonder is how do
so many of em live to grow up per-
sons that think cowboys live a rough
life should consider th football play-
ers before formin any hasty conclu-
sions

  its said that experience comes

through hard knocks while i dont be-
grudge myself th former blue could
a saved me some of th latter-which
i could a got along without justs well
as not-by sharin certain information
with me not that i blame him be-
cause i was holdm out on him an we
couldnt very well share confidences
without one or th other of us makin
th first pass

  blue an me was lured from our
home range one fall to investigate some
new cow an horse country that had
been touted most favorable whilst
proselytin we made headquarters at th
odaka hotel in agua hondo

  th town wasnt named that way be-
cause it was mexican but to sort o tell
th truth as a warnin to prospective
land purchasers an at th same time
disguise its weakness with a spanish
name for th benefit of real-estate men
tt had deep water for fair th town
itself owned a well of unlimited flow at
a depth of six hundred and eighty feet
th railroad compny had built its round-
house an shops on th strength of a
peoples story magazine

similar water supply but all others had
run out o hope money an patiwce
before strikin th underground river
one persistent gent drilled a thousand
feet then he saddled up his pony an
headed for th pecos river-sixty miles
away-statin that it was closer to water
in that direction than where hed been
drillin an not so expensive

  grass was fine an high showin that
th country attracted its share o rain-
fall rut what good is rollin prairie
without somethin for livestock to
ckink wherefore blue an me in our
room on th second floor of th odaka
hotel decided to drift

  as for me blue declares i dont
know what i was thinkin of to leave
tli rio grande valley my broomies
are makin me money ive got livin
springs back there in th hills an grass
good but somehow i never rest easy
till i investigate these reports o some-
thin better

  i accept th apology for havin drug
me up here with yu i told him mag-
nanimous if i had any better lay
than th boskies for my cattle i wouldnt
know what t do with it

  i wish now says blue gazin out
of th window wistful that we could
be back in ringolade or thereabouts
tor thanksgivin we could eat brad
porters turkey an step out at his baile
in th evenin that new hardwood
floor hes had put in is great for
dancin

  wish for somethin reasonable i
advised him this bein sunday puts
thanksgivin only three days off an
its two hundred an fifty miles horse-
iiack to ringolade-less we sell our
ponies an go by train

  there aint enough money in agua
hondo to buy scrapper blue settles
tliat point

  an salvador aint for sale at any
price i agree with sentimental
thoughts about my mount why dont
we stavv here theres goin to be a

football game an dance weve got
acquainted with some tolerable good
friends hereabouts whichll make it
more endurable than spendin th day

among strangers

  ill remark in passin that some agua
hondo folks were more friendly with
us before than after that particular
thanksgiving day also if we could
a foreseen what would happen wed
a probly left right then an there

  blues hatchet face brightened not
so bad he commends failin in with
th idea immediate which team shall
we root for

  agua hondo had been all het up over
this football match frank callan a
railroader had organized a team from
th shops to compete with th eleven tim
best recruited in town we didnt know
such a heap about th game havin seen
it played only two or three times so it
was all tli more important that we
choose a side to root for if we figured
on gettin any kick out of it

  why i dunno i worried callan
th mechanic eats here hes a good
scout an captain of th railroaders an
meador th bonus clerk who sits next

to him at table-

  an then we have with us blue
chirks up considerable little timothy
best who besides operatin th agua
hondo bugle is buildin big loops at
violet th landladys daughter hes
goin to play at guard-wherever that
is-for th citizens also theres
smilin  dorgan th barkeep whose
two hundred pounds at center on th
same side ought t be useful hard-
rock jansen th village blacksmith will
be at tackle they board here too an
we know em justs well as we do th
railroaders

  that avas as far as we got toward
choosin sides before supper but it put
me in a receptive state o mind when
callan buttonholed me as i came down-
stairs ahead o blue who had lingered
to shave
the comeback



  dont either you or your friend play
football cowboy he inquires beamin
good-natured callan was a big strap-
pin young chap with happy eyes an a
fight in jaw

  why no i told him honest but
danielson-i used blues correct
name sos calland know who i was
talkin about-is a runnin fool an
might do yu some good if yure short-
handed

  speeds what we want callan
beckoned to a bunch o shopmen who
were gathered round th office stove
wvre shy a half back an one tackle
if he is fast maybe hell do behind the
line cant we induce you to try out
for the other position he urges

  not me i refused i never went
in for athletics but you work on dan-
ielson when he comes down hed
make yu a good hand besides bein
a foot racer he could fight his way
through a herd o mountain lions an
deem it a pleasure but dont tell him
i sic-ed yu onto him i added when th
gang showed signs o undue enthusiasm

  i slipped into th dinin room sos to
be out o sight when blue appeared
figurin on listenin to some fun when
he started to augur hisself out of a job
playin football blue is th fastest run-
nin human ive ever seen but it gen-
rally requires th combined efforts o all
his friends to induce him to take his
exercise other than horseback so i
didnt prophesy much luck for th foot-
ballers

  th supper bell hadnt rung yet so
i was all alone till violet nascer our
landladys daughter come in with a
tureen full o soup she dropped a few
tears into th soup an her face was all
screwed up into curves-so i judged
she was cryin

  smatter violet i ask sympathetic

   she put th dash on th table

  nothin she replies in a quaky
voice an without lookin at me

nothin she stamped out into th
kitchen

  ive noticed that when women are
tearful its good judgment to let em
alone further if any consolin was
necessary in this case tim best bein
her steady compny was th elected
party id heard that she didnt get
along with her pa-a lazy good-for-
nothin who let violet an her ma do
all th work involved in th hotel lease
-an judged theyd fell out over some-
thin

  it wasnt but just a second or two till
violets voice like she was in distress
rose above th sound o rattlin kettles
an pans this was followed by th girl
herself who come bulgin through th
swingin door with her old man hot on
th trail

  she charged in behind me an nascer
brought up short when i rose to my
feet

  now a outsider who interferes in
famly quarrels is most completely out
o luck an i never knowed it better
than i did at that minute but when
a scared girl o seventeen or eighteen
with sharp red marks on her face where
shes been slapped comes to a man for
protection he doesnt hardly feel like
lookin  while she gets beat up

  yur wife wants yu i told nascer
without givin ground an pointin to
mrs nascer who stood in th doorway
pale an tremblin

  dont let him touch her mrs nas-
cer begs quiet sos th other boarders
wouldnt hear

  i dont know just what id a done
if nascer hadnt made th first pass at
hostilities by grabbin th front o my
shirt to shove me aside

  out of my way he snarls his un-
combed hair standin on end

  his layin hands on me made it my
battle so i let drive one that wrecked
his nose no doubt it hurt-though i
couldnt see how it was any alibi for
him to quit cold an start cryin


peoples story magazine

  now tildy see what you went an
done called on a stranger to whip your
own husband	

  i opined that mrs nascer would tie
into me immediate for abusin her man
-an was gratified a heap when she
told him

  you pack your duds and go i ve
stood for your abuse and laziness but
when you strike my daughter youre
through good-by and bad luck to you

  she was a frail little woman but she
put a lot o meanin into her words an
didnt weaken when nascer bolted to
th kitchen with both hands to his face
an blubberin like an anxious calf

  thank you sir she embarrasses me
by offerin a hand in gratitude while
violet sobbed a whole lot hes only
violets stepfather-and a bad one at
that her own father was a good
man-

  no doubt says i upsettin a bowl
o oyster crackers in my nervousness
too bad he didnt live shall i call
th boys to supper

  please do mrs nascer requests
violet she put an arm around th
girls shoulders tender i need you in
the kitchen

  i couldnt help but feel squeamish
over th affair no one that pd ever
heard of got away with dippin into
somebody elses famly row an i didnt
feel that i was about to set any new
precedents also pd missed bearin
blue alibi hisself out o playin football
with th railroaders

  before i give th summons to chuck
i decided that pd talk blue into makin
a immediate departure stead o waitin
till after thanksgivin but i was too
late-an all on account of its bein my
own fault

  blue come in all surrounded by rail-
roaders who couldnt hardly leave his
flanks long enough to let him through
th door to th dinin room-every one
talkin simultaneous

  his first remark when he sat down
beside me was

  well dutch pve promised to play
feetball with these gents 

  eh no  gasped

  yep he tells me all full o self-
satisfaction theres nothin to it
some one hands me th ball an i run
down th field with it

  oh says i inhalin my soup i
thought it was more complicated in th
games ive seen th man carryin th

ball gets upset an jumped on-

  sure brick a whoppin boiler-
maker with curly hair an red face ex-
plains its that way if a mans own
teammates dont do their duty us fel-
lers on th line are supposed to flatten
out th opposition so the backs can run
right on through

  youd better throw in with us
dutch blue urges play that tackle
position an help me out in case i get
jackpotted

  he knowed puttin it personal that
way that i couldnt refuse besides
i was due to stay in agua hondo till
after thanksgivin less i left without
blue which i wouldnt a considered
so th railroaders gained another re-
cruit an made me feel more at home
when they all conceded that none of
em had ever played football except cal-
kin an meador

  tim best sittin at th next table
smiled sour at all this talk an winked
wise at dorgan he smiledourern
ever when violet all flushed up an
cheerful come in with th meat course
an give me a lot o unnecessary service
while she had nothin moren a passin
good evening for him i enjoyed it
some at that a pretty girl that eyes
yu with favor aint to be greeted in
a spirit o mournin an competition is
th spice o life-so long as it aint too
serious or sentimental

  after supper meador callan brick
an some other railroaders come up to
th room with blue an me we dis-
the comeback



cussed football considerable an framed
a number o scientific plays designed to
flabbergast th citizens an separated
about eleven oclock agreeinto meet on
th gridiron as they called it th next
evenin at four th railroad give em
a hour off each day for practice

  blue pushed me out o bed at a quar-
ter to six in th mom in-it bein my
turn to feed our horses which we kept
in a rented barn

  salvador an scrapper were used t
havin their com early an we hadnt
changed their habits durin th cross-
country trip or while livin in agua
hondo neither of us minded gettin
up at that hour-bein always astir by
daylight when at home-but th winter
cold in a boom-town hotel chills th
marrow in a persons bones th odaka
had been built more in th interests o
speed than comfort th owner was
none too liberal with his lumber an
the carpenters had probly done th best
they could with th material on hand
in consequence o which it contained
all th disadvantages o cold outdoors
with none of th pleasures of real fresh
air

  a base burner in th lobby downstairs
furnished th only heat nascer was
supposed to start it mornins an i fig-
ured on helpin with this chore in case
hed sure enough left in answer to his
wifes request

  th stove was in operation when i
got downstairs an a lamp was burn in
on th desk

  i tiptoed down th long dark hall-
way sos not to wake th guests that
didnt get up till late speculatin on
whether nascer had made his peace with
his famly or had mrs nascer or vio-
let built th fire-when a door flew open
sudden just ahead o me an i was en-
cumbered by dingin arms soft and
feminine-violets i couldnt see her
with any degree o distinctness but i
felt her presence heaps

  she kissed me on th nose her aim
wasnt so good but her intentions was
evident

   you didnt give me a chance to thank
you last night she whispers

  it was a most thoughtful an roman-
tical occasion afflictin me with chills
an fever at one an th same time i
couldnt hardly make a report o this
to gladys belden-who id been
chargin with some regularity in ringo-
lade for th past eighteen months an
tim best bein violets beau would be
most annoyed about it still an all-

  i thought yu was savin em for
tim i told her in a voice that was
affected some by nervousness an some
by a attempt to make it sound roman-
tical an tender

   dont you like for me to kiss you
she asks subdued droppin her arms
into place

    course says i not wantin to hurt
her feelins also bein human i aint
immune to osculation in fact its en-
joyable if not too severe or lastin do
it often

   she did

  i caught my breath just as it was
leavin me complete

   did yur stepdad leave i inquired
solicitous

  hes gone for keeps she assures
me thats why im so grateful to
you

  an what about tim 

  i gave him his walking papers last
night he acted ugly when i told him
how nice you were-

   footsteps on th stairs warned me it
was time to leave but violet didnt
seem t be particularly concerned-
which made me all th more nervous

   see yu later i said confidential
edgin sidewise down th hall since i
didnt know what else t do

   i got to th barn without no further
mishaps an took plenty time feedin
th ponies sos to make sure th dinin
peoples story magazine

room was thickly populated when i went
back to th hotel for breakfast

  th report concernin my run-in with
nascer had been spread an th kail
roaders heckled me a lot about rescuin
beauty in distress no one seemed to
feel th loss of nascer-who never had
any popularity t lose-but there was a
prevailin belief which there was no
bashfulness about expressin that  io-
let an me ought t get married to cele-
brate tli occasion in a fittin manner
blue regarded me with suspicion be-
lievin doubtless that id been slippin
over a secret romance without advisin
him of same

  if it hadnt been that i had in mind
a certain incident that they didnt know
about i might a kidded em back but
havif this to worry over all  could do
was look sheepish an grin protestin
complete innocence

  when th talk commenced runnin to
football i joined in an was glad of th
chance havin passed through a most
painful session whilst every one-ex-
cept tim best-was rawhidin me
blue was all agitated an interested in
th game-which i would also a been
if it hadnt been for a series o black
looks that tim showered at me from
his blond an otherwise-good-lookin
face

  i knowed thered be a comeback from
my buttin in on th nascers famlv
affairs-an here it was violet feelin
under obligations to me had overplayed
my hand with tim an thereby pro-
vided me with a rival which i neither
craved or was entitled to in fact tim
couldnt hardly classify as a rival he
was out which made it worse it
put me in th position o havin put him
to rout an lord knows i didnt have
any such aspirations an how could
i go to him with my side of it without
it lookin like hed scared me out or
exposin  iolet as a woman scorned

  besides which she wasnt a woman
scorned-none whatever t admired

her plenty she had a face an ligure
that would a caused mr solomon his-
self a thrill-an jealousy in his harem
but she wastoo serious-minded-or too
young or too enthusiastic or somethin
an had me back into a corner gaspin
for air a man likes t choose his own
corners-an th one id chose would
be shared by gladys belden-if by any

  the others havin a head start on
me got through eatin before i did
blue left th table along with th foot-
ballers an iirst thing i knowed i was
practiciy alone with my thoughts-an
y iolet who come in an sat down oppo-
site me it was evident that she thought
id done it a-purpose in order to have
th time with her

  halstead th grocery man an rie-
der who sold real estate pulled their
freight after shakiu their fingers play-
ful at me from behind violets back
favorin me with knowin smile

  tim best slammed th door as he
went out-an there i was with a heap
on my mind an no words to express
it with

  violet comments on a lot o personal
things an then inquires abrupt have i
ever been in love

  well says i wishin id eat break-
fast somewheres else hum thats
a hard question to answer-

   like that she retorts in a way to
mean that she didnt an with a expres-
sion on her face that indicated her wild
irish had rose it looked like a scene
an tears was impendin so i rushed for
th handiest way out

  its just that i aint used t dis-
cussin th noble sentiment i alibied
myself an im bashful sure im
in love right now i held my thoughts
steadfast to gladys belden

  thats better violet puckered up
her mouth when she smiled-a most
charmin maneuver

  now what  considered frantic in-
side myself would blue danube do
under similar circumstances hes a
the comeback



considerable ladies man an knows how
t handle em ill just get her intrested
in blue which will let me out without
no casualties

  she babbles  about admirin cow-
boys an how well i looked on a horse
-which give me an openin

  yu just ought t see my friend blue
danielson sit th snaky cues i started
an then i give her full plans an speci-
fications regardin blues virtues an
attainments as a foot racer fighter an
friend i was makin progress judgin
from th attention she paid when blue
stuck his head in th room inquirin
if i needed a rope

  come in  invite ive just been
tellin miss violet how yu recovered
our horses when they was stole at san
lorenzo

  did yu tell her how yu pyramided
yur bets on th foot race an like to
ruined both of us  blue grins siltin
down beside violet

  no i didnt says i gratified
you tell her while  run upstairs for
my hat

  i was gone from there leavin blue
lookin into her eyes an employin th
smile that had made him famous with
th girls on our home range

  half a hour after this blue come
to th room an inquired why i didnl
get back i told him id been writin
a letter

  i was still tellin em scary to violet
when her ma chased me out he in-
forms me

  an i wondered why i didnt have
some such luck

  durin that an th succeedin two
days previous to thanksgivin i di-
vided my time between violet poker at
dorgans place an practicin football
th two latter items caused me less
trouble than th former violet would
overtake me when i was least expectin
her-once as i was tryin to slip through
th front door on my way to feed th

horses twice in th hallway an sevral
other times at diffrent places she
never tired o tellin me what a favor
id done her an her mother in riddin
em o nascer-an i bore up under it
as brave as possible always wishin
her off onto blue when i had a chance
blue didnt seem to mind it on account
i judged at first that she didnt put him
on th defensive all th time

  but when blue commenced remarkin
what a nice girl violet was an how
funny that we hadnt discovered it till
such a late date my ears come to at-
tention it sounded like blue was get-
tin in deeper than id figured on i
didnt care much for th sound o that
an thought id better give him some
confidential information about how vio-
letd been shinin up to me but if a
mans in love he dont want advice from
nobody an if he aint he dont need it
so we played our own hands separate

  in spite o knowin itd do no good
i suggested a couple times that we jump
our contract with th football team an
hit for home but blue voted it down
since i couldnt offer any good reason
without tellin him that i wanted to get
away from violet-which didnt sound
very manful even when millin it over
with myself if hed consented id
probly a backed down on leavin be-
cause wed give our promises to play
with th railroaders an our leavin
would cripple em moreover it didnt
look just right to leave violet flat that
way either wed have to sneak off like
a couple bums or else i at least would
have t submit to a most embarrassin
time in tellin her good-by id told
her that blue an me would be on our
way before long an if her conduct
then was anythin to judge by i didnt
crave to be in on th finals

  what made it all th more confusin
was that violetd never come right out
an say anythin definite about her senti-
ments it was all insinuation shed
make a conversational pass to give me a
peoples story magazine

opportunity to say somethin pleasant
when i didnt come across shed sulk
an weep then id weaken an every-
thin was lovely i planned to tell her
if i got th proper lay that i was en-
gaged but she never give me th chance

  our line o repartee run somethin
like this

  id love to live oti a cow ranch
with the right man shed say it coy
an with a dangerous look in her eye

  now how could i say well it
wont be with me im engaged

  so id stall women have to work
terrible hard on ranches most of em
leave their husbands in a short time
but you shed vamp me tearful
an confident wouldnt permit romance
to die by letting your wife become a
drudge

  well maybe not id hedge but
im a terrible hard man to get along
with i wouldnt hesitate to beat up on
a woman if she stirred my temper
you shed laugh at me a
woman could scare you out of the house
with a cross look

  she was right but it didnt help my
case none

  did she have a idea that she owed
me these attentions as a reward tor dis-
posin of her undesirable stepdaddy i
did my best to disabuse her mind of any
such notions an there was blue
leanin over her at every excuse with a
free line o entertainin chatter it
looked like id dug up another rival if
i was standin in his way all i wanted
was to get out of it only i didnt
seem t know how-though i told violet
all th favorable things i could think of
concernin him an none about myself

  now i wasnt pleased with blues
prospects either i couldnt see where
hed have any luck even if he should
marry violet-she was that flighty an
temperamental if she could switch
overnight from tim best to me it
showed that her heart was in too many
places at once an if blue should man-

age to gather her affections it would
make her look more like a guessin con-
test than a desirable helpmate shed
also changed favorites in th football
game-bein now a loyal rooter for th
railroaders whereas shed formerly-
been a booster for th citizens

  tim best got surlier as th days went
by an on thanksgivin momin he of-
fered to knock my block off when i
made a offhand remark about how bad
us railroaders were goin to beat th
citizens callan an dorpaa patched
things up when  invited tim to try his
luck but it was only temporary be-
cause tim swore hed get me some
other time course he wasnt just
bowed up because id made a good-na-
tured brag we both knowed th rea-
son  but it was only me that knew how
useless it was for us to quarrel

  all agua hondo postponed thank-
givin dinner till supper time in order
to be at th football grounds at half
past two th crowd was assembled on
th west side of th field since th other
side was occupied by prickly pears an
spanish daggers

  th gridiron which was supposed to
a been cleared by mexicans had been
marked off with white lines an was
adorned promiscuous with cactus beds
sagebrush an buffalo grass at each
end crossbars had been built ten or
twelve foot above th ground if any
one got close enough to em he was
supposed to kick th ball over th one
that was handiest providin th oppo-
sition didnt keep him from doin so

  there wasnt a football suit on th
field a few of th players had diked
emselves out in baseball clothes blue
an me were dressed in overalls an hick-
ory shirts-as were most of our team
except cutie bull at center who was
wearin corduroys his size was such
that he had to get his overalls made spe-
cial an didnt want to risk em in th
game he had another pair o cordu-
the comeback



roys ordered so he figured he could
spare those he had on 

   a lanky well driller kicked off for th
citizens an callan caught th ball i
was told about callans catchin it be-
cause while i was watchin th football
turn somersaults in th air tim best
knocked me for a aurora borealis i
got up fightin mad an pursued him
but callan barked out a signal an i had
to pass up tim in order to get to my
place on th line

  i fell all over hardrock jansen th
blacksmith who played opposite me at
tackle when cutie passed th ball to
dale rh quarter back jansen was
peeved a lot an swung a wicked hay-
maker at me when he come to his feet
since meador was travelin around th
other end with th ball i give jansen
my undivided attention for a few sec-
onds th referee fined th railroaders
twenty-five yards for my part in this
fracas claimin he didnt see jansen hit
me this set us back about twice what
meadord gained

  then callan who was runnin th
team from his position at full back
called th signal for blue to make what
they called a cross-tackle buck i
was supposed t clear a path for blue
to carry th ball into cutie hadnt 
moren passed th pigskin when jansen
walloped me alongside th jaw now
id been fined for doin just that to him
a minute before so i didnt take no
chances on th referee seein me-an
rammed jansen in th solar plexus with
my head so blue had tolerable clear
sailin till he hit th second line o de-
fense which treated him pretty rough
-but not till hed gained ten yards

  jansen lost some more steam when
blue repeated twice dirough th same
place for fifteen yards more an tim
best called for time out while he
swapped places with tht blacksmith

  business had been good while jan-
sen was playin against me but with
tim on th job it picked up even more

he knowed more about scientific slug-
gin-so th referee wouldnt see him
at it-an punished me somethin scan-
dalous hed played th game in col-
lege

  now id had designs on helpin tim
make a hero of hisself by lettin him
break through me occasional figurin
that if he distinguished hisself violetd
look at him with favor but th odd
were too much against me in th first
place i didnt enjoy th idea of bein
a choppin block for tims diversions
without defendin myself  an in th sec-
ond place blue was demonstratin him-
self to be more of a hero than i could
a made out o tim anyhow

  i looked over to th side lines where
violet was jumpin up an down yellin
danielson danielson an saw
blues finish from his remarks i
felt confident that he was a heap inter-
ested in her so with her all excited
over him-there wasnt but one answer
that let me out but it was cold com-
fort because it meant that blue was in
besides th prospect o losin my pal
to a girl that never would make him
happy i felt responsible for exposin
him to such sentimental danger

  th whole citizens team concen-
trated behind tim an we couldnt push
blue for any more gains we lost th
ball on downs

  th citizens started to work their
full back through smilin dorgan at
center an human forms piled up ten
deep-for cutie bull upset all calcula-
tions an half th opposition fists flew
an blood flowed th bank teller who
played at quarter back for th citizens
matched blue for a fight-which ended
up with another penalty for th rail-
roaders an a substitute for th citizen
tim an me meantime fought another
round

  play was resumed in a rough an in-
dustrious manner with me gettin th
worst of tims scientific sluggin
peoples story magazine

twice th railroaders due t llue
ability to carry th ball were within
twenty yards of th citizens goal an
each time tim annoyed me with his
fists so much that i clouted him foi
vary in distances in sight of th referee
on four other occasions railroaders
got set back for finishin battle that had
been started by citizens

  th first half ended with no scorin
accomplished an when th railroaders
grouped together for th intermission
i had some remarks to make

  i understand that fist tightin is part
o th game all ive ever seen have
broken up in a row says i but
longs its that way why should th ref-
eree fine us for doin what th opposi-
tion indulges in regular

  callan was nursin a swelled eye
which mills one of th citizens half
backs had presented him with all th
railroaders were crippled up more or
less blue an me specially lookin like
wed been tamperin with a sausage
mill

  lets submit a proposition that th
referee forget penalties on rough
work suggests bull whose voice an
name had considerable in common

  this idea got immediate support
from all hands

  callan met with th referee an tim
best to talk it out tim an th referee
roared a lot but agreed finly that itd
be every man for hisself in th second
half

  callan kicked oft for th railroaders
an blue come streakin past me up th
field hurdlin brush an cacti three
citizens got in his road an all took a
swing at him blue dodged em with-
out reply upset th interference an
callan nailed th man with th ball who
happened to be mills mills tried a
short-arm jab such as hed been usin
havin forgotten about th new rule-
or lack of it-an callan waited till hed
got to his feet an bounced his fist off
mills left eye

  mills hollered for th referee

  stand up and fight you yellow
pup callan shouts youve been
doin that all afternoon and this is the
first honest chance ive had at you

  mills didnt care about that kind o
warfare an th ball went into play
prompt ilippo adair th citizens
lull back crashed through me for a
nice gain o five yards but stopped
when meador an blue gathered his
neck an legs

  this adair person was a coal miner
from gallup who liad been workin as
jansens assistant in th blacksmith
shop he didnt weigh quite so much
as a horse but he had some of a bronks
accomplishments-kickin an strikin-
so after he got through walkin over
my carcass an half a dozen citizens
worked me over with their feet an
knuckles i got up shakin my head like
a fairgrounded bull-an with about as
much animation

  right away th citizens shot adair
through my tackle again there was
a battle over my body which i found
out afterward was waged by meador
an blue against mills an tim who
were tryin to finish me off tim was
after my hide but it was some com-
fort to know hed had to call in th
reserves

  when th next play took place i
found myself behind th line weavin
to an fro with calians arm around me
for support

  blues in your position callan
whistles through his windpipe youll
be all right in a minute

  he left me dove over th heads of
linemen an gathered adair by a scalp
lock him an blue made a team all
by theirselves adairs charge was a
most dismal failure that time-resultin
in a loss o several yards-an tim
emerged lookin like hed been through
a earthquake hed assaulted blue
tliinkin it was me in a weakened con-
dition he probly still thinks he
the comeback



hubbed me an wonders how i made so
quick a recovery for i was back in
position on th next play-which was
lucky because otherwise blue wouldnt
a had th chance to use his famous
speed

  hippo thinkin some error was ac-
countable for his loss took th ball for
another charge through me but he
never got to th line i dove under
tim thus upsettin him callan went
through th beach an hit hippo so hard
he dropped th ball-which blue gath-
ered before it reached th ground-ac-
cordin to all reports-an was in th
clear w-ith his first jump

  citizens mights well a pursued a
antelope for blue with th ball tucked
under his arm was gone from there
leapin from one clump o bunch grass
to another like liza crossin th dela-
ware on ice cakes only little sackett
th substitute quarter back was between
blue an th goal line when i finly
shook tim off me an could view th
proceedins sackett throwed hisself
at blue who was then movin at race-
horse speed an come to rest in a bed
o cactus at about th time blue who
side-stepped flashed under th cross-
bars an into th midst of a throng o
outraged citizens that were shoutin
crook  dirty work an kill im 

  blue disappeared under a human
avalanche railroad shopmen an a
few husky engineers flocked to th
rescue

  i never have figured out what foul
play was supposed to a been commit-
ted by blue but t realized right then
that he needed much help with th least
possibly delay so i started leggin it
down th field pronto though not so
fast as callan brick an meador who
were real sprinters

  i come to a sudden stop under th
impression that a mule had disputed
th right o way id forgot about tim
but it seemed that hed remembered me

an had singled me out for private rea-
sons an persona attention his face
was grass an dirt-scarred his nose
was oif-center an his eyes showed signs
o wear but littered like a mad stallions
i once saw i absorbed these de-
tails along with a couple well-placed
blows before gettin into action from
then on business was right brisk i
knocked him loose from th ground
three times while he was dealin out
misery to me th last time he didnt
rise up again

  i rambled on to th main hostilities
anxious about blue th town con-
stable an a few deputies complicated
matters by tryin to arrest folks two
of em took me in charge but brick
who was disengaged at th moment
pulled em loose an threw em to one
side

  wheres blue i asked brick his
shirt was almost completely gone an
he was pantin

  over there brick waves a badly
skinned-up hand toward th northeast
an i spied blue workin side by side
with cutie bull an takin on all com-
ers that relieved me long as blue
was on his feet there was no cause
for worry so far as physical results was
concerned th only bad features about
it was that he was still further distin-
guishin hisself for violets benefit
every woman admires a fighter an i
had no doubt but that violet was in
tli screamin mob o ladies that were
bunched together in th background i
couldnt locate her but i was satisfied
that she was there rootin for blue an
ready to fall on his neck just as soon
as th war ended

  all this run through my head in a
few seconds then brick an me was
called on to repel boarders who
swarmed down on us from all sides
it didnt seem to make any difference
how many we discouraged  there was
always more to take their places they
were sure earnest with their fists
peoples story magazine

  thats tli time dutch i heard
blues yell of encouragement an cutie
give a roar to back him up th pair of
em forced th fightin over to our side
of th battlefield an with their help
we waded in more cheerful an confi-
dent

  how long would it take a town di-
vided against itself to come to a deci-
sion with lists id admire to know
we didnt find out on that thanks-
givin day because th fire whistle blew
whilst both sides were goin strong
each warrior halted in his tracks at th
first blast an then those that were able
ran west ia th direction of th main part
o town

  agua hondo bein built o wood
didnt dare take any chances on fire
an th siren had been designed to re-
mind all persons of this fact it had a
voice that wailed an shrieked an chilled
th heart no one could hear it with-
out bein certain that it was his own
house that was bein burnt up an be-
comin frantic for fear his wife an
children were in it if a man didnt
have any famly he was sure to think
of a dozen reasons all equally good
why he should lend a hand th siren
had a personal note for every one

  therefore th lame an those that
were halted for some other cause were
helped by th able-bodied in th rush
for town th fight was over as prompt
as it had begun-an for a far better
reason blue an me bein both con-
vinced that th barn containin scrap-
per an salvador was in flames were
makin all possible speed across th foot-
ball field when i thought about tim

  lets see how tims makin out i
called at blue he was fast losin me
in th mob

  we hurried through th crowd an
found tim where id left him-but not
near so much alone violet had his
head propped in her lap an was
spongin his face with her handker-

chief i couldnt a been more sur-
prised at seein a calf climb a tree
but blue just wore th same expres-
sion he does when he stands pat on
two pair

  we aint needed here says blue
lets go

  but violet spied us an withdrew her
support from tim immediate to rise up
an storm at me

  beast she proclaims to my intense
astonishment thug plug-ugly
coward youve all but killed my tim-
mie

  why-th darn roughneck like to
ruined me before  could defend my-
self i blurted out mad

  liar she screamed in what i didnt
consider a very ladylike manner ruf-
fian  you picked on him because of
me

  i couldnt figure her out i didnt
try very long neither could i under-
stand why she didnt pay no tention to
blue who had nothin to say but kept
his face which was naturally lean but
now plump from swellin in straight
lines

  we drug it-a quarter mile behind
th main stampede

  there was no fire not even any

smoke

  whoever tied down th siren did it
to break up th fight cutie bulls wife
was suspected because she had disap-
proved th football game on account of
its bein so rough an she was afraid
cutied get hurt but it couldnt be
proved on her neither did any one
propose resumin hostilities women-
folks led their men home to give first
aid unattached gents assembled at
dorgans bar for stimulants an infor-
mation it was discovered that th or-
chestra was too badly damaged to per-
form that night an th dance was
called off

   railroaders claimcd victry o course
on account o blues touchdown citi-
the comeback

zens were consoled by th thought that
their side might a won if th game had
been continued-which was impossible
because th football had been wrecked

  blue an me beat it to th hotel for
a bath an change o clothes our foot-
ball outfits were in rags an neither of
us were feelin any too peart bein cov-
ered with bruises an cuts

  theres nothin further to hold us
in this mans town blue opines as
were slippin into our moleskin pants
an well be so lamed up we cant move
if we wait till mornin to make a start
why dont we leave this evenin we
can gather us some lunch at dorgans
an make to rianoco by midnight

  blue looked anxious an i judged he
wanted t make a quick get-away on ac-
count o unpleasant recollections which
had to do with tim an violet id
heard that a man is keen to leave th
scene of a unsuccessful love affair

  suits me says i we can mail a
check to mrs nascer as we pass th
post office im rarin to get aboard my
pony this footwork has got me all
stove up

  blue give me a queer look but said
nothin an begun to roll his few be-
longing inside his slicker i did simi-
lar with mine we worked fast an
made it from th hotel before violet
showed up

  within a half hour we were saddled
up an on our way home across th
prairie we had some trouble gettin
away from dorgans where survivin
members o both teams-includin cal-
lan brick meador adair jansen an
cutie bull whod slipped away from
his wife-were comftably lit up an
playin th game all over again

  dutch says blue in tones o sym-
pathy im sorry for yu but i cant
help but think its all for th best
that was almost exactly th speech
id had framed for him 

  dont waste emotions on me i re-
assured him all i regret is that you

iouldnt a fell in love with some girl
that  approved of

  me fall in love blue demands
if ive been that way some one is
holdin out on me spose we under-
stand each other

  so i told blue th facts sort o
sliamefaced battin my eyes in th red
light o sunset

  you just dont understand about
women he advises me solemn with a
hand on my arm an consequently i
couldnt work intelligent when yu
left violet with me monday i was con-
vinced that yu did so for th purpose
o havin me further yur interests with
her therefore i told her patronizin
that you was unpopular with th ladies
didnt have much sense an that i palled
with yu only because i felt sorry for
yu-at th same time boostin my own
stock she figured o course that i
was buildin a stack at her an was
knockin you for my own purposes

and-

  o-o-o  is that th way to work
it i sputtered

  sure blue informs me yu
make a hero out of a man an a girl
hates him on sight knock him an
shes plum satisfied that yure doin
so from selfish motives theyve al-
ways got sympathy for th under

dog-

  then tell me why was she so tickled
when i worked on her stepdaddy

  no woman admires a quitter he
explains

  an tim won violet back by put-
tin up a game fight an bein knocked
out

   thats it

  an spose tim had cleaned up on
me 

  then violetd been weepin over
you stead o tim

  so thats th way of a womans
heart

  violets says blue terse an con-
fusin theyre all diffrent

i-a price on his head

night big black blanket that it
is had fallen upon the big
woods and tucked its furry
tinny feathery populace to sleep it
was so dark that a barrel of pitch would
have loomed up like a bonfire only the
sentinel of the law pat the police dog
remained awake and his eyelids were
drooping like the grand finale rose of
summer if only something would hap-
pen he mused as he ambled aimlessly
over the same old monotonous beat

  then suddenly and unmistakably
there came a sound pats ears flapped
back against his head with a bump that
jarred him into full wakefulness it
was a voice he listened intently once
before hed thought hed heard a
sh-h-h only to discover to his official
embarrassment that it was just a couple
of trees whispering but this time it
was the real thing he ducked behind
an ash can and listened

  theres a big price on your head
i tell you he heard in a muffled tone
to-nights your last chance to escape
get out of here-go to the hills any-
where-and wait until this thing blows
over theyll get you sure to-morrow
go

  pat recognized the voice as that of
gay dog well known canine about town
a likable neer-do-well gay dog but

none too careful about his companions
pat had long suspected that some day
evil associates would he his undoing

  but there was no time now to think
of gay dog here was a fugitive from
justice a criminal with a price  his
head pat was still thinking about that
rhine-stone collar hed buy with the re-
ward when he heard the crackling of
bushes and turned to see two forms

  gun in claw he dived into the under-
brush on the trail of the desperado it
was dark but soon he had his quarry
-a strange rough-necked red-headed
fellow

  by the time the common fleas court
had convened next morning the officer
had rounded up his material witness as
well judge sober owl listened to pats
story then called gay dog to the stand

  this is a terrible outrage barked
the material witness with a snort
terry turkey is a bird of high ideals

  but broke in pat petulantly i
heard this witness himself say this pris-
oner had a price on his head he must
be some dangerous-

  dangerous nothing came back gay
dog of course hes got a price on his
head seventy-two cents a pound to-
morrows thanksgiving that s more
than youd bring on fourth of july with

  something was going on over at jockey deans house something very
  important and right at the finish of the big handicap

when a young man has been tak-
ing reckless chances with fate
riding his mounts to victory with
an abandon that brought sorrowful
shakes of heads from veteran turfmen
and then suddenly plays a conservative
hand in a gruelling race his status as a
jockey comes under criticism

  it was in the city handicap at bour-
bon track with a may sun smiling on
the kentucky landscape billy deans
mount mayberry a bay gelding ruled
favorite in the mile classic and yet
mayberry came into the home stretch
pocketed his rider refusing a forlorn
hope dash at a meager opening offered
on the quarter turn billy dean finished
third and was given credit for a poor
ride which was partly merited

  sugar foot williams his ebony
face drawn into worse than lugubrious
took charge of mayberry when billy dis-
mounted and headed for the weighing
room beneath the judges stand

  hold up yore head hawss he con-
soled  somepin done happen to mister
billy hes gone and lost his rid in hab-
its

  bpe

  johnny dodge and jimmie wheeler
were discussing the same matter up at
jockeys quarters you betcha may-
berry had the edge he could have
slipped me into the second hole an
eighth away if billy had cleared the
pocket asserted johnny i got a
hunch hes lost his nerve

  wrong dope drawled a melancholy
voice-slippery sams no one had
seen or heard him enter hes playing
safe-i got the info straight

  there were many who held slippery
sam to be a spy of the track officials
at least he was an employee whose
duties were never fully known but he
loaned money cheerfully and handed out
a benevolent line of philosophy many
swipes hostlers and jockeys often won-
dered at the lifting of a ban perhaps
unjustly at least hastily placed few
credited slippery sam with being a con-
tributing factor

youre all wrong the newcomer re-
peated billys still good for the pilot-
house job hes getting fat for one
thing cant ride unless he reduces for
a ride under a hundred and five but


peoples story magazine

heres the low down-theres a visitor
scheduled for the dean castle and hes
not coming by train or auto or on foot
hes arriving by air-when he gets here
-and driven by a stork chauffeur et
me dean rode mayberry to-day with
a whole family on his shoulders dont
blame him for being safe

  jimmie wheeler was another bene-
dict it had been a matter of weeks
since his wedding down at new orleans
slippery sams explanation caused him
to be thoughtful for a time

  i never looked at it that way
jimmie admitted first place i never
took the chances billie dean did but
im just a plug jockey never expect to
be the top notcher billie is if i see
a fighting chance i take it and thats
all

  billie made em vouchsafed slippery
sam thats the diff now his gam-
bling with luck has hit him in the face
all in a wad and hes slumped hell
be over it hope so for he is going
to need some coin darned bad

  johnny dodge was changing clothes
he was not riding again that day the
trouble with you billie dean and me
-everybody-is weve always a handi-
cap to pack me im off of this mar-
ried life for keeps but ive got troubles
of my own theres the old gent and
my mother up in pennsylvania theyre
still wondering how in thunder i took
to the track and send me sermons to
repent of my ways but you bet your
boots i send them a check each month
and they take it lifes blasted funny

  slippery sam looked at johnny with
heightened interestd  umbrella mike
told me you had something more than
cobwebs in the watch tower but i
doubted it now i apologize dont
forget billie he slouched down the
narrow stairway humming softly

  curious bird commented johnny
brushing his hair before the distorted
mirror on the wall he wants to help
dean out and dont know how-yet

sa-a-av  turned to lirnmie sup-
pose we can help the kid slip him a loan
for instance  at least we can perk him
up

  i he jockeys from the sixth race were
ascending the stairway billie dean in
the group so long jimmie called
johnny well talk that over to-mor-
row

  with that strange efficiency peculiar
to the turf the news about billie dean
spread so that it was common knowledge
the next day furthermore old marse
the blakely entry for the blue grass
cup was handicapped at a hundred and
three pounds even the owner was
amazed at the light impost but if
blakely was amazed billie dean was
dazed  his actual weight was one hun-
dred and six and he would have to re-
duce the race was only five days
ahead

  there was a council of war over at
the blakely stables ltmbrella mike al-
though trainer for the florella string
and hoping devoutly that star lad
would be the cup winner had visited
big jim blakely and advised a holiday
period for billie dean he had been
inspired by the appeal of johnny dodge
for whom umbrella betrayed a fond-
ness so billy whose dreams had been
filled with visions of rotund jockeys un-
able to mount their entries received
orders to ride no more until the blue
grass cup and to submit to a drastic
diet

  sugar foot williams hovered outside
the stable office and met the jockey
mister billy he urged i wukked in
a prize-fighters camp once let me take
you for a road run evry mawnin it 
pull you down

  that was the reason the next morn-
ing shortly after sunrise slippery sam
heading for the track stopped and
gasped puffing although still trotting
up the road came billie dean and the
negro hostler the jockey was un-
slen furlokcrs and a jump

steady although holding on to his pace
grimly sugar foot favored slippery
sam with a wide grin as they passed

  mali boys going- to reduce hisself
to plum nothin if he has to he an-
nounced 

  they had gone a block before the on-
looker closed his mouth durn his
hide commented the track employee
heading toward bourbon park four
hours later he had an earnest conversa-
tion with judge roberts arbiter of
bourbon track destinies the track of-
ficial shook his head no sam i cant
do it the handicap cannot be changed
i admit old marse is carrying a light
load but there are better horses with
comparatively light imposts-star lad
for example with a hundred and ten
pounds

  judge roberts walked awav with a
final shake of the head the other
gazed ruefully toward the white frame
house visible between stables a block
distant from the tracks outer fence
where billie dean his wife and aunt
made their home

  i did my best defended slippery
sam

  of afternoons billie would come over
and himself work out old marse his
face lost some of its fullness sugar
foots training on the road coupled
with strict dieting was telling it had
done far more than that billie was be-
coming weak he learned that as they
rounded the turn below the clubhouse
stand and billie thought of trying out
old marse in the center of the track
which was still spongy from recent
sprinkling old marse held grimly to
his rail position and billie was com-
pelled to take an additional wrap of the
lines to veer his mount to mid-track
he alighted after the exercise heart
racing and staggered to the rail after
handing the lines over to sugar foot

  whassa matter mister billy in-
quired the negro alarmed

  oh-nothing too much training

i guess that afternoon he weighed a
hundred and three pounds he lost two
more pounds before saturday the day
of the cup race dawned he should
have been exultant over this fact but
he forgot it due to subsequent events

  for the doctor who came to the dean
home very often now shook his head
that morning ill be back at noon
he announced aunt mary smiled but
billys face grayed he followed the
physician to the door

 say doctor does this mean-

  i imagine it does cut in the prac-
tioner but you go ahead in that race
to-day i like to see husbands out mak-
ing money theyre fairly useless on
occasions like this anyway besides i
believe old marse will win the cup

  aunt mary led her nephew to the
breakfast table eat what you want
this time it wont count and dont
worry you need the two hundred com-
ing if old marse wins besides ill
hang out a bed sheet from the attic win-
dow if-if anything should happen

  the jockey sat before an untastcd
breakfast for a half hour then he
arose and went into a darkened bed-
room where a wan face smiled up at
him aunt mary who had been talk-
ing gently arose and left the room sud-
denly leaving the couple alone

  honey you go ahead and ride to-
day she insisted maybe-maybe-
aunt mary told me about going to hang
out the bedsheet as her signal to you
over at the track-maybe she wont hang
it out until after the race and billie
dear i want you to win so bad

  he reached awkwardly for her hand
there was a lump in his throat i
guess we need money all right even
if i have our savings account to draw
on but i wont be able to keep my
eyes away from home while im over
at the track ill be praying every min-
ute to get back before-before it is
over


ihoples story magazine

  both were silent a little awred at
coming events they heard the screen
door to the kitchen shut and a mas-
culine voice conversing with aunt mary
billie gazed at his wife whose lips were
trembling ever so slightly he bent
over her

  are you afraid margaret

  she smiled bravely back no she
protested

  it was aunt mary who summoned
him to duty billie you go over to
the track and see old marse gets his
exercise like you want it i dont care
if mr blakely has trainers by the dozen
its a jockeys place to watch his horse
on race day so get

  as billie left the porch he saw the
familiar outlines of slippery sams back
hustling up the street now where
in the world has he been he won-
dered

  fifteen minutes to post time for the
fifth race-the blue grass cup the
usual air of tension hung over the track
preliminary to the big race the jock-
eys hovering about the veranda above
the throngs entering the paddock gazed
at crowds milling before the pari mutuel
machines beneath the stands

  johnny dodge tapped billie dean on
the shoulder say you ought to see
the swell field glasses umbrella mike
asked me to keep for him this after-
noon

  glasses say loan them to me a
second implored billy johnny handed
them over turning to wink at his fellow
riders billie adjusted the binoculars
and leveled them on his home visi-
ble over the fence beyond the seven
furlong chute there was no signal
displayed from the attic window the
house seemed deserted

  if you want anybody to keep an eye
on your mansion to see nobody steals
it overby here will watch announced
johnny hes not riding to-day just
loafing around

  billie regarded the others face a mo-
ment say fellows guess i just as

johnny dodge

  i dont mean my reducing and all
that protested billie i mean over at

  i said we know repeated jimmie
wheeler

  billie glanced first from one to an-
other then to little overby already at
his post with the glasses johnny
he inquired is that the reason you
brought those glasses here

  slippery sam told us replied
johnny we want to help you and
thats all we could think of-just watch-
ing for the signal

  the fifth race bugle blew a quiet
line of jockeys filed down the stairway
and into the paddock billie was trem-
bling so much that sugar foot who
was holding old marses saddle mut-
tered as he placed it on you isnt
scared are you mister billy

  only that i wont get out in front
and stay there

  over the hostlers face spread a grin
boy comes that mount order this nig-
ger is running for the ticket window
i bin afraid-now i aint go through
lak you used to mister billy thass all

  the bugle sounded again the line
filed out through the paddock gate and
 to the track for the parade to the
seven furlong chute as they came by
the jockey veranda billie glanced up at
overby nothing doing shouted the
watcher forgot was the stands as
billie riding number four came into
sight of his home again in front of
the clubhouse the attic was still de-
serted oh lord he entreated let
it be after this race is over
 seven furlongs and a jump

  a pause-the starters hand fell-
the webbing flashed upward a mighty
roar swept through the crowd the
line of eight dashed out of the chute
abreast a pretty sight jockeys colors
blended into one glory of gorgeous
shadfes only the veterans saw star
lad ease quietly into the lead and real-
ized the florella horse would be hug-
ging the rail within another eighth
johnny dodge was executing umbrella
mikes carefully laid campaign it was
one of the few times the real owner
of the string morgan came to bour-
bon track he was up there in the
reserved section watching through a
pair of glasses umbrella clung to the
rail-his usual position-gazing with
eyes only

  something else was stirring up the
backfield well filled at the end of the
first quarter it was whoopalong go-
ing into the first division the field
had shifted now for the turn battling
for position in the gruelling home
stretch fight daughtry patrol judge
galloping along the infield ahead of the
racers was first to see old marse wake
up but he could not see billies gray
face weakening grip voice intoning
monotonously got to win-got to
win

  it was a flash of the old spirit rid-
ing with lines still wrapped about his
wrists billie leaned forward saw an
opening to his right old marse felt
the whip then a tug of the reins

  oesars ghost ejaculated the pa-
trol judge number four went
through just like an eel watch him

it will be him and star lad on the
home stretch

  the same opinion was given by the
crowds in the stands a moment later
daughtry was right the bay gelding
rounded the turn and into the home
stretch on star lads flanks johnny
dodge glancing under his elbow saw
the pounding hoofs gaining at every
plunge hand riding he fought at this



menace but felt rather than saw old
marse draw up until before they neared
the upper end of the stands star lad
was dropping back with his whip
pounding ever- stride billie dean rode
old marse beneath the wire a half
length ahead rising in his stirrups
he began to pull up his mount within
two hundred yards he would have turned
and ambled back to the judges stand
but his eyes subconsciously raised and
gazed toward his home he gasped

  a white sheet was waving from the
attic window

  bourbon track has had unusual hap-
penings but none more so than billie
deans astounding performance after
winning the blue grass cup pounding
on down and around tlie oval old marse
and rider reached the mouth of the
seven furlong chute into it they
turned old marse gaining speed every
jump a chorus of ah-h-hs swept
from the stands judge roberts leaned
over the railing of the judges stand
and made frantic signals to daughtry
patrol official now racing his wiry cow
pony-a veteran accustomed to the hum-
mocky infield-toward the chute

  umbrella mike forgot star lads de-
feat he climbed to the top of the track
fence and watched the plunging thor-
oughbred there is a gate opening
through the outer track fence at the
farther end of the chute

  hes going to jump shouted um-
brella

  five thousand pairs of eyes voices
silent watched old marse approach the
five-foot whitewashed fence across the
end of the chute big jim blakely
standing in his box on the clubhouse ve-
randa groaned

  crazy-ties gone mad and old
marse never took a jump in his life

  even as he spoke the gelding slid
over the barrier like a veteran steeple-
chaser brought up with barely a stum-
ble and galloped toward the gate

swung open a moment later horse and
rider vanished

  silence hung over the stands lor a
matter of seconds then every one be-
gan talking and shouting sugar foot
williams who had been waiting ex-
pectantly before the judges stand for
billies return began to run down the
track in the excitement no one saw
daughtry make a small gate to the track
cross it cut across and out again dart-
ing behind a row of stables in the gen-
eral direction old marse had taken

  morgan owner of florella stables and
star lad shoved his way through the
voluble crowds and reached the judges
stand he was followed by blakely

  hey shouted morgan to judge
roberts im going to protest for star
lad

  ten minutes passed then a negro
appeared on the track leading a wear-
ied race horse as they neared the
stands the crowd recognized old marse
sugar foot was leading the gelding a
slender figure slipped out from the
group along the track fence and met
the negro even a hundred yards away
the negros grin was visible slippery
sam exchanged a few brief words and
then ran back toward the judges stand

  what happened a score of voices
inquired the runner shook his head
and padded up the stairway gaining
judge roberts ear he whispered 

  its a boy

  what

  yes sir and to the track officials
slippery sam told the story how billie
had seen the signal morgan listening
in amazement was the first to laugh

  man  you tell me that boy pulled
off such a stunt to see his kid why
i dont blame him let me tell you-

  but blakely owner of old marse
was still nettled suppose that fool
boy had broken my horses neck  im go-
ing to let him go

  do entreated morgan do and ill

sign him on judge i withdraw my
protest and my compliments to old
marse for that jump

  that is all very fine observed judge
roberts glad you feel that way about
jt but the rules have been violated and
we must discipline the jockey why
there he comes now

  daughtry leading his pony wralked
alongside a subdued billie dean shouts
of approval and derision came from the
stands

  but the jockey gazed stolidly down-
ward while daughtry seemed to repress
an inclination to smile the throng out-
side made way for them to o into the
judges stand

  from the veranda of the jockeys
quarters johnny dodge and jimmie
freeman took turns gazing at the scene
through the borrowed glasses

  what you see demanded jimmie
theyre giving him cain informed
johnny well whatta you know about
that morgan is patting billie on the
shoulder old big jim blakely is grin-
ning so is judge roberts wonder
what happened 

  slippery sam told them later at
that moment daughtry had just noti-
fied the judges he had followed billie
dean to the house he never was out
of sight from the time he jumped off
old marse judge he never slipped
any weights-didnt want to for that
matter but he can go on the scales
with a clean record because i came back
with him

  this is most unusual announced
judge roberts he held a short ses-
sion with the other officials then turned
to billie dean

  you are suspended-indefinitely he
said let me see to-day is saturday
supiose you come around monday be-
fore the first race we might reconsider
your case

  a moment later the stands roared
number four went up on the infield
board old marse was declared winner

lyman creech had planned it well and gap rambo seemed near the
end but there was something about eunice that rendered creech
helpless his words mere words   

ap rambo marveled that a
wound so small could produce
so much pain so much fever
from time to time he felt it tenderly
a seared gash through his hair where
a bullet had ripped the flesh of his
scalp he had missed death by the
quarter of an inch

  in the last six hours he had covered
no more than a mile from the scene of
the shooting for the most part he had
skulked in the underbrush that grew
thick and tangled on the side of the
mountain pi is pursuers were every-
where at times he crawled flat on his
belly like a stricken animal

  the blood had run down over his face
and his fine soft shirt of white cam-
bric  had dried sticky and black ly-
ing close to the earth under a mass of
sumac breathing the acrid stagnant air
he tried to orient his whirling thoughts

  he had ridden into sighing pine to
force an understanding with old ne-
hemiah mercer had met the aged

banker in the little dirt street of the
ozark village nehemiah had berated
him with high-pitched carrying vituper-
ation

  dont dare mention eunices name
reckon youll get her an my money
after im gone the old mans face
had been livid with passion gap had
wondered that eunice could be this
mans daughter no lazy card-play-
ing bully-

  gap had gotten down off his horse
people a few of them were looking
from a distance he tried to lead the
old man across the street to get him
into the comparative seclusion of the
pines that grew in a fringe at the foot
of the hill

  two shots brief seconds apart had
split the air the first had knocked off
gaps black felt hat staggered him the
second punctured nehemiah mercer in
the throat just above his low white col-
lar a look of surprise crossed his
face and he crumpled slowly with his


peoples story magazine

life blood pulsating down over his stiff-
fronted shirt immediately death be-
gan to glaze the bankers eyes

  gap had been stunned paralyzed a
womans shrill voice rose gap ram-
bo-shot-nehemiah 

  sure theyd think that he was as
mystified as a babe as innocent but he
was gap rambo the sport the gambler
the gun toter

  a shotgun belched rained leaden pel-
lets around him from the porch of the
general store sim agnew the mer-
chant was trying to shoot him down-
like he was a mad dog

  in a confusion of blood and pain and
self-preservative instincts gap had
taken a bound to cover had become of
necessity a fugitive they would say
that he had tried to make love to a
respectable girl a rich mans daughter
and had in a tempest of passion mur-
dered her parent mad dog that was
they called him mad dog rambo

  well there were a dozen men in the
hills who would hide him the nearest
sanctuary he judged was tom taylors
cabin the beauty of it was that it was
so close to town a scant two miles back
in the thickness they his pursuers
would expect him to go deeper into the
hills there was a deep satisfaction in
the knowledge that the lazy hounds
around sighing pine couldnt sniff at
his fallen hat and pick up the trail
through the brush theyd have to send
to harrisonville for blooded dogs it
would take a whole day and a night
by stage the trail would be cold

  gap rambo reached around to his
hip pocket and felt for his revolver it
was safe fully loaded unfired taylor
would hide him more he would stick
by and fight for a rambo in a pinch
old tom taylor and gaps father had
been bushwhackers together in the days
of the civil war

  the blood bond was unbreakable if
only gap could reach the cabin even
in the thick shadows of the wildness

the terrific heat of the sun riding high
in the afternoon sky made itself felt
a myriad of ringing insects flew in a
constant circle around the blood stains
the spittle in gaps mouth had dried
up tongue and throat were leathery

  somehow he emerged into a clear-
ing got onto his feet and began a
weaving course to the cabin that shim-
mered like a vision before his eyes
down in the road gap was dimly aware
that some one astride a mule was look-
ing it couldnt be helped luck gap
rambos luck might prevent the fel-
low from realizing what was happening
in the last resort gap had always re-
lied upon that luck luck made his
living and had saved his skin a dozen
times it never could desert him
totally

  his hand found the latch of the cabin
and for a moment he steadied himself
against the jamb of the door beneath
the muck that was on his face a whit-
ish pallor had spread over his strong
almost handsome features already his
eyes were dark sickly hollows the
once immaculate apparel that marked
his taste for dress hung torn disreput-
able upon his lank frame

  tom taylor wouldnt care how he
looked gap pushed in the door some
one moved about inside the light was
poor

 oh rambo-

  gap made out a fleering face half fa-
miliar wholly unfriendly where s
tom taylor

  the face came nearer why gap
yore hurt step right in an set down
- the voice was like honey

  momentarily gap hesitated an in-
gratiating hand had him by the arm
he stumbled inside sunk into a splot-
bottomed hickory chair wheres tom

tay-

  too late to avoid it he saw rather
than felt a blow with something heavy
descending upon his uncovered head
the mad do a

an overpowering darkness curtained his
vision

   water cold and sweet was held to his
lips in a hollowed gourd a splash of
it was dashed in his face gap rambo
opened his eyes

  lyman creech

  the man walked with a stiff halting
motion across the puncheon floor and
replaced the gourd in a bucket when
he turned his face was grim filled with
contemptuous satisfaction slowly he
came back across the room and let him-
self down stiffly into a chair facing
gap

  thets me-creech he said with a
rasp its been some time since you
seen me they buried old taylor last
month an i bought his cabin you
see gap i been up to the city try in
to get my leg cured but twarnt no
use the hip socket was plumb
smashed the doctors say the legll al-
ways be stiff-a cripple for life thats
yore doins gap-thets whar you
kicked me

  creechs sallow features gathered a
spasm of hatred with an apparent ef-
fort he calmed himself he was mostly
a rack of bones incredibly aged for a
man of thirty

  gap rambo made an effort to rise
fell back as though in the clutch of a
dozen grappling hands the yellow
teeth of lyman creech showed in a
crooked mirthless grin

  no use mad dog i got you tied
to the back of thet chair done it snug
and purty arter i belted you on the
head you been unconscious moren
two hours gap and what do you think i
the sheriffs posse is all spread round
the cabin i reckon somebody must
hev seen you come here and give the
word

  a curse formed on gap rambo s
ashen lips was checked lyman creech
chuckled slyly

  thets funny gap- them fellers

holdin oil cause theyre afraid to come
up they think youre hidin at the
winder with a gun lord an you as
helpless as a kitten an them waitin

fe-r night to try a rush-

  gap rambo managed to catch and
hold creechs shifty eye with a steady
stare

  creech why dont you hand me
over 

  no hurry gap theyll wait
gaps captor got up and moved with
ins stilted gait to the water pail hev
another drink gap i want you should
feel as well as you kin taint no
pleasure doin business with a man
whats half out of his head

  thanks creech

  again rambo drank deeply water
was what he needed once more his
intrinsic strength legan to surge in his
veins the cool gamblers brain began
to fuction again like a rusted instru-
ment that receives lubrication

  in many respects the situation re-
minded him of a tight poker game a
steady nerve the ability to think faster
and further than an opponent

  creech im ready to talk turkey
gap said in a level voice what  say
you can depend on as long as i have
been living i never broke my word to a
single human being i never will im
tunny that wav-but even you know
that

  creech nodded slowly yes-youre
thet kind of a fool mad dog

  a flush stained rambos cheeks you
wouldnt call me mad dog if my hands
got loose his voice was thick in-
stantly he realized that he must control
himself by a supreme effort he forced
back his anger im going to talk the
only language you understand creech
-money

  the crippled thin fingers drummed
on the top of the pine table you had
a hundred an sixteen dollars in yore
pocket gap if you mean to talk about
peoples story magazine

thet you kin save yore breath  al-
ready got it and im goin to keep it
rambos face was impassive

  thats only the first payment he
said i dont ask you to take a single
risk just cut these ropes and hand me
back my revolver that i see layin on
your table i give you my word i won t
harm you furthermore inside of three
months ill send you a thousand dollars
ill make my get-away and you can
count on the money just the same as if
it was in the bank i can go up to
joplin an pick that much up in maybe
less than a month

  lyman creech limped over to a small
square window looked out silently
when he turned his face was solid
stone

  i see three men settin on the fence
down by the road an they got guns
lengthwise acrost thar laps one of
em is obe carter the best shot in
hickory county up back of the house
sheriff lane and the beasley boys is
layin in the brush the chances air
thet youd never make it mad dog
id make it on my luck alone
creech and youd get your thousand in
maybe a months time

  creech sucked in his breath with a
hissing sound

  a thousand dollars youre talkin
like a tinhorn-a cheap skate if i was
to turn you loose id want anyhow ten
thousand and youd be fool enough to
keep yore promise if you made it but
let me tell you somethin you tinhorn

skunk-

  he paused and came forward until
his face was within a foot of gap ram-
bos eyes that were live coal of liv-
ing hatred burned with an unquenchable
flame

  damn you you couldnt git loose
if you offered me fifty thousand you
busted me gap rambo you made a
damn limpin freak outen me-you
kicked me outen eunice mercers yard

-you kicked me outen a fortune right
thar an a good woman besides an
inter -a derisive gesture embraced the
disheveled cabin-this i been layin
fer you mad dog an i got you
i here was that in the eyes of lyinan
creech that told gap calmly that any
attempt at propitiation would be futile

  i was countin on your greed
creech he said frankly i might
overreach myself tryin to get ten thou-
sand but ill promise five-inside of a
year without my help thats moren
youll ever get till your dyin day

  his gamblers instinct told him that
he had lost even as he watched the
flare of the battle of greed against re-
venge in the eyes of lyman creech
mounting steadily gaining dominance
was the fanatical glisten of the hot eye
that bespoke the seething spirit re-
venge won and in its victory a chill
fixity of purpose overspread the entire
being of lyman creech

  the lord delivered you into ray
hands and by god youre mine 
never thought it could happen so sweei
when i turn you over to the posse
youll linger in jail till they hang you
youre as good as convicted now 
heard the news myself an hour afore
you turned up at my cabin

  youll be hung but youll linger in
jail fer months i got somethin to
show you rambo-

  from the bottom of a greasy cupboard
lyman creech got out a small blunt
hammer with a homemade helve of ash

  look at it man thar aint no pain
on airth like a busted hip socket  ou
caint sleep thar aint no peace on airth
without drugs an you caint git em
in jail youll lay babblin fer months
on a lousy cot youll beg em to stretch
yore neck rambo im goin to bust
youre hip and turn you over to the
law

  gap lunged forward strained in fu-
tility at his bonds his lips were
clenched between his teeth until they
the mad dog



bled an eerie cackling laugh broke
from the narrow lips of lyman creech

  god-if i could get my hands on
you-

  thets right mad dog rave its
music to my ears thets part of my
pleasure first you suffer in the mind
an then in the body i wont crack you
fer a while yit-

  gap rambo suddenly relaxed in his
chair mastered the passion that flamed
in his being- once more the face be-
came a mask it was a game he was
a gambler

  the run of luck is inconstant if
he lost if he died in agony and degrada-
tion it was-luck there was little or
nothing to regret in his past he had
ridden hard and fast his hands had
not been soiled by labor

  a free man he had roamed his native
hills while his fellows had scrimped and
struggled on a rugged stony soil his
sure deft fingers had supplied him with
plenty of money from the zinc mines
down in the big town even up in a
place as mammoth as st louis he
had known the joy of fighting and win-
ning gap rambo can whip his weight
in wild cats men had said he had
been feared and respected a roving
scourge

  something sharp cut at his heart eu-
nice  there were two kinds of women
in his life slack daubed women-and
eunice the others were of the flesh
eunice was of the spirit when he
thought of her it was as of a mellow
comforting light shining through some
substance that was beautifully trans-
lucent

  the emotion he told himself was not
love it was an instinct a magnetism
love meant kisses embraces gap
rambo just wanted to be in the pres-
ence of eunice mercer that was all
sleeping he had often felt her pres-
ence a glow a light sometimes it
frightened him  always he was attracted

  think it over creechs rickety

voice roused him give your mind
over to the misery whats a-comin me
im goin to set right here and enjoy
myself lookin at you

  minutes dragged into hours the sun
sank in a forest of crimson and gold
from among the trees a fragrant breeze
sprang cool and refreshing lyman
creech looked at an old silver watch

  it ought to be dark inside of an
hour or so theyll come an git you

mad dog i reckon its bout time-

  one thin hand reached out to the pine
table the emaciated fingers curved
around the helves of the hammer
steadily gap rambo kept his eyes upon
every movement of the other

  creech was on his feet advancing
  whats that noise

  the cripple grinned nothin to
save you gap its only the boards
squeakin under my feet

  youre a fool creech theres some
one at the door listen-look

  from the inside both men saw the
wooden latch lifted slowly the door
pushed open an inch at a time with
an animal cryr lyman creech threw his
body against the door slammed it shut

  his voice rose to a shriek keep
out ye caint cheat me wait five

minutes-two minutes-

  some one rapped on the oaken planks
a silence fell

  its eunice mercer let me in
please

  the hate the distortion of anger that
was upon the countenance of lyman
creech began to dissolve into a cun-
ning light watching him gap rambo
grew pale tightened like steel through
his long well-knit frame

  i might creech said softly as
well make a complete job of it come
in eunice

  with a jerk he threw the door wide
open the girl without hesitation
stepped in creech closed the door


peoples story magazine

this time he slid the wooden shaft of
the bolt

  erect as straight and supple as a
young lily eunice mercer stood in the
center of the room a shining mass
of chestnut hair was gathered loosely
on a smooth neck her features finely
cut were curiously masklike in her
widening dark eyes was an expression
of infinite quietness

  i have come gap to take you with
me

  she was hatless clad in blue gingham
that gap rambo was bourn  in a chair
before her that lyman creech lurked
evilly at her side affected her no more
apparently than if she had been in a
trance

  lyman creech put a trembling hand
on her shoulder set down eunice
slowly the somber eyes turned upon
him fixed him as though in response
to some unspoken command the hand
dropped from her shoulder creech
took a backward step until he was
against the table

  get up gap and come with me
the words choked up in his throat
this aint-no place for you-eunice
he caint git up and go with you
eunice cause i got him tied he mur-
dered yore father he caint move a
step thout i say so the man passed
a tongue over dry lips ner you
nuther eunice the two of you caint
do a blessed thing only on my terms
you got to talk to me

  neither heard the plainly spoken
words of lyman creech

  the sheriff sent you eunice-

  they let me come because they knew
that youd shoot down any man that
stepped in the clearing as long as there
was daylight they couldnt stop me
they said you had killed my father

and-

  you dont believe that

  no but even if you had i would
have come just the same

  to save me-to help me get away

gap rambo shot a livid glance at ly-
man creech you dog did you think
that you could stand up against a power
like that

  eunice mercer stood straight with
her arms at her side when she spoke
there was something mechanically in-
evitable in her tone

  i came to save you gap but not to
help you get away after this day you
can never be the same again neither
can i it is the turning point the end
of our pasts if i had not received this
-she touched her breast-this light i
would have died when  heard the news
when i saw his body you must come
with me gap back to the men who are
waiting for you-for me to bring you

  the high-pitched laugh of lyman
creech picked up the end of her words
his hands outflung themselves in a ges-
ture of exaltation

  why gap wouldnt do thet hed
be a fool girl no man loves a woman
better than he does his life no sir
gap hes going to listen to me now now
when its me thets talkin turkey gaps
goin to take his chance of gittin away
scot free an clear of bullets thars a
ravine back of the house a scoot fer
it arter dark-from the cellar door-eh
gap

  the poignancy of lyman creechs
voice strumming through the dense air
of the cabin like some off-keyed note
of a whining instrument had caught and
held the attention of both gap and the
girl

  look here both of ye i got you
both like thet-in my fist gap i kin
kill him if i like i kin use you eu-
nice as i please you-all an me is a
different breed of cattle oure both
soft but ye dont know it

tween life an hangin hell find plenty

is his solemn promise an yours too
eunice thet youll marry me thet gap
wont ever interfere ill be good to
you girl ill double an tribble the

money whats been left to you-

  a violent shudder ran through the
slender frame of eunice mercer oh
gap-her voice was a sob-i love

you so so much-

   its either thet creech broke in
or hangin an a busted hip socket

   it was no time to smile yet the face
of gap rambo despite its disfiguring
stains was shining with happiness

  the thing you seem to overlook
creech he said smoothly is that for
the last five minutes ive had my hands
free you tie knots like a woman

  he was on his feet with the loose
loops of ropes dropping to the floor

  i reckon creech ill work on you
fer a few minutes and throw whats left
out of the window

   in a flash lyman creech had reached
for the weapon that was on the table
rambo was quicker catlike he was
upon his man had twisted an arm be-
hind his back until a scream of pain
broke from bloodless lips one swift
hand found creechs own revolver in a

picked the owner of the cabin up and
slammed him like a broken piece of
furniture into a corner inert softly
sobbing lyman creech lay where he
fell

  eunice-with me after dark-down

the ravine-

  with you anywhere forever gap
if you make me but its wrong its

the turning point weve got to stay
here and face it

gap rambo was like ice old solid
theres no nourishment in being
hung or spending a lifetime in the peni-
tentiary at best out there we can
have everything each other

  but how there was agony be-
wilderment in her tone

  gap smiled she was a child a mel-
low innocent light shining through

something beautiful translucent-

itll be easy honey with my luck
my skill i can handle a deck of cards
like you can play the piano-yes better
and youre the best player i ever heard
she shook her head

  youll kill something in you and in
me too if you go your father left
you a farm you could work it hon-
estly

  dont be a fool gap said quickly
im as honest as the men who try to
win my money work-thats for
horses and engines-not for free men
besides i wouldnt get a chance to
work the farm i tell you a dozen peo-
ple will swear they saw me fire that

shot-

  she was silent for the first time in
his life gap rambo missed something
from eunice mercer it was as though
a light were dimming were flickering
out

  youll come with me-

  her hands found a place on his shoul-
ders

  to the end of the world gap but
im leaving my heart my soul back here
in the hills where i was born where

you were born the fine clothes-

her voice faltered broke the-other
-women i know theyll come
before his eyes she withered began
to sink gap caught her in his arms
held her as he would a child her lids
fluttered closed my heart-here-
in our country-gap- it was no

more than a whisper

  appalling as acute as ten thousand
steel fingers clutching at his heart was
the pain the sensation that he had killed
something that he had taken a life more
precious than anything he had known
before in a moment of clarity it came
to him that in saving his own life he
would be taking from eunice mercer
something of impalpable sacredness in
the great outside world he would be
content perhaps but she-the mellow
light would be extinguished forever

  no man loves a girl better than his
life

  creech had said that creech gap
rambo suddenly realized had lied
very gently he lowered eunice into a
chair

  look honey-

  deliberately gap rambo picked up his
own weapon and that of lyman creech
from the table breaking his own he
ejected the shells into his hand and
poured them into her lap

  its the last loaded gun ill ever
carry honey no matter what happens

  y ith a snap he broke lyman
creechs revolver noted subconsciously
that it was a new make there were
five chambers only three shells fell
out

lery when we walk down to meet the
sheriff honey funny creech had steel

bullets in his gun-

  steel bullets a shudder ran
through the girl they said it was a
steel bullet killed father it-it fell
right down in the road

cabin on the greening side of a moun-

chapter vi

when they had had their drinks
and were gone the agent
sat quietly in his chair for
a while and as he sat his sharp
nose seemed to become blunter and
his jowls more plendulous his lit-
tle close-set eyes glistened the full
red lips moistened shinily they
parted revealing the strong yellow
teeth he uttered a sound a growling
sound not pleasant to hear nor was
the man pleasant to look upon in-
deed at the moment he resembled noth-

ing so much as a pig and a beastly
pg-

  at last he got heavily to his feet and
went to a corner cupboard and brought
forth a bottle of rohr mchenry he
possessed an educated palate this tall
stout indian agent and for his per-
sonal delectation drank a brand of
liquor he would not dream of offering
to his acquaintances

  he tilted out a stilt drink of the pri-
vate stock sipped it delicately savor-
ing it with keen enjoyment he put
away the bottle and the glass and


peoples story magazine

teetered back anti forth on his heels
again he smiled that toothful smile
he put out his open-lingered right
hand slowly he brought the fingers
to the palm clenching the hand till the
muscles in his wrist stood out by the
expression on his countenance he might
have been squeezing something it gave
him excessive pleasure to squeeze

  hanging behind the door was his
quirt he slipped it off the hook and
drew the double lash through his fin-
gers with loving tenderness he
whirled it crosshanded and brought it
down twice upon the table with all his
strength the double percussion
sounded like revolver shots

  beat me will you he gritted out
again cracking the unoffending wood
with all his might ill show you
ill cut the hide off you ill make you
crawl youll lick the soles of my
boots before im through

  furiously he began to thrash the ta-
ble top as though it were a mule-or a
woman-he wished to subdue

  naughty table make you mad or
somethin  a satirical voice broke in
upon the song of the quirt

  charlie shale stood still as a stock
the quirt raised high he turned his
head leaning across the sill of an
open side window was mr william
derr slowly the agents arm fell at
his side i was just seeing if this
quirt was any good was his totally in-
adequate explanation

  instantly he bethought himself that
there was no reason why he should ex-
plain his conduct to bill derr or any
one else he became stiff very much
on his dignity he walked across the
room and hung up the quirt

  come in if you want to he said to
bill derr

  im all right here ive been all
over the reservation charlie and none
of the police or your feather-dusters
have seen a sign of sile seemingly he
aint been near the reservation

  charlie shale sat down then that

settles it he couldnt have come here
  you think so

  good lord man dont you think
so yourself

  i m asking you what you think
ive already told you what i think
i-

  now listen charlie derr com-
plained ive already told you what i
think about your shouting at me this
a way you stop it

  but how many times do you want
me to tell you that i havent seen sile
thompson that i havent the slightest
idea where he is and that i dont be-
lieve he was ever within ten miles
of the reservation how many

times-

i met the hawkins outfit riding
away from here was derrs apparently
irrelevant interruption i suppose they
landed the contract for the next issue
what if they did

  nothing oh nothing a-tall did
i tell you it was about that particular
contract sile was coming to see you
i dont think you mentioned it
he sure wanted that contract for
us determined feller sort of sile is
hasty feller too it dont always pay
to be hasty does it charlie

i dont know im not hasty
derr regarded the agent with critical
disfavor youre not thats true
do you believe sile could have hap-
penstanced an accident charlie r

  he might have

  hasty fellers do have accidents
dont they

  i dont know that they have more
than any other kind of people

  im glad you think so charlie
your words are a comfort then you
dont guess sile had an accident

   didnt say that  dont know
but you do know you havent seen
him

  how many-good od man of
course i know i havent seen him 
---- -

 the wagon wheel

  well all right i just wanted to
make sure seems funny nobody saw
him after he left marysville

  he may not have taken the main
road there are short cuts

i know there are but if he took
a short cut he ought to have gotten here
sooner than by coming the main road
unless he stopped by the way
or was stopped

  whod stop him

  i dont know im going to find
out

  oh i dont believe he was stopped
by anybody he didnt have any ene-
mies did he

  hasty fellers always have enemies
sile had enemies everybody has ene-
mies ill bet even you have enemies
charlie

  but this charlie was not disposed to
admit i guess i get along pretty well
with most folks sile maybe had an
accident bill horse might have
thrown him and drug him such
things take place every day if it hap-
pened way off in the mountains you
might never find out what became of
him i wouldnt worry if i were you
bill sile will turn up all right youll
see 

  no i wont worry i wont worry
a-tall but if anybody else is mixed up
in siles accident this anybody else will
worry so long charlie so long

  bill derr turned from the window
and was gone

the agent went to the window and
watched him mount his horse and ride
away on the trail taken by the hawkins
outfit i hope he ties into them  he
muttered vindictively damn his soul
that bill derr is too big for his pants
he went quickly to the cupboard and
poured himself a drink that slopped the
rim and now when he drank it was
noticeable that he sipped not at all he
gulped

  but how are you gonna manage
  bpeo



thorn hank asked the question that
had been uppermost in his mind ever
since leaving the presence of the agent

  how am i gonna manage thorn
repeated pap which i aint gonna
manage thorn

  hank laughed unpleasantly elect-
ing sim and me huh

  pap glanced askance at the silent sim
sim knows better

  you been talking it over with sim
and left me out huh bumbled hank
resentfully

  cant you do anything besides huh
like a pig demanded the irritated pap
i aint talked anything over with sim
i didnt have to sim knew mighty
well that i had some scheme or other
for takin care of thorn you didnt
hear sim asking any questions did
you 

  aw lemme alone grunted hank
youre always ridin me ridin me

anybodyd think-

  oh for gawds sake shut your
trap anybodyd think you were a
woman hearing your tongue clack
when it comes to ridin you i dunno
who rides you more than thorn does
hank was understood to curse thorn
and all his works

  pap smiled evilly you dont seem
to like thorn

  hank swore again

  i dont expect youd feel bad if
thorn was to stub his toe and break a
neck or somethin hazarded pap
watch me weep snarled hank
thorn has been getting too wide-
spread and new lately said sim
softly

  spoken like my own simmy pap
approved cordially funny how you
and i think alike most always

  when you two get through passing

riddles- began hank

  i guess ill have to explain it to you
in words of one syllable hank pap
said kindly how would it be to let
out thorn
peoples story magazine

  let him out how you mean
easy enough thorn aint going to
take kindly to the idea of shale marry-
ing dolly hell just about hit the ceil-
ing

  hell kill shale said hank
  unless shale sees him first

  sim nodded i thought thats how
it would be

  yeah smiled pap that would fix
things fine as frawgs hair-if shale
saw thorn first and wed fix it so he
would see thorn first then we
wouldnt have to give thorn any three
hundred dollars far permission-per-
mission-here pap spat with dis-
gust-for the use of dolly and we
wouldnt have to split profits four ways
any more instead of two fifty apiece
out of every thousand wed get three
thirty-three and a third i guess that
aint to be sneezed at

  well have to get thorn out of the
way till the joke is sprung declared
hank naturally naturally ive
thought of that too well send mis-
ter thorn down to look over the ranches
south of damson and blossom and see
which ones are good for us to operate
on its a long months job even if he
only half does the work right

  but we know all about how the
ranges run down there objected sim
and thorn knows we know it
sure we know how the ranges run
its the outfits i want thorn to look
over which ones are slack and which
men ride with their cinches tight we
dunno a thing about them so you see
mister thorn will earn his keen for
once

  well have the time of our lives
proving to thorn we hadnt a hand in
letting shale have dolly hank said
uncomfortably

  dont you fret about that com-
forted pap but well have the time
of our lives persuading dolly to marry
shale

   lo said pap hawkins stroking

his shirt and grizzled beard hows
tricks jim 

  coming in bunches replied jim
ferret a small individual with a short
chin and worried eyes set far apart i
cant complain

  no said pap eying jims com-
fortable ranch house i guess you
cant tlie kids all yours

  all of em was the reply from
that lile towheaded tad johnny play-
in under the washbench to ida may
fifteen-year-old and big for her age
whos in the kitchen helpin her maw
round dozen all told i got pap and
every one living

  aint lost a one huh you are
lucky dont guess youd wanua sell
one if the price was right

  jim ferret perceived the pleasantry
he laughed money wouldnt buy a
one of em i aint got none too many
i like kids i do

  i guess you do pap assented mus-
ingly i guess you do

   light and rest your horse pap in-
vited the hospitable jim

  id like to jim id like to but
the fact of the matter is i came over
to see about your white-nose chestnut
i saw one of your girls riding him and
i guessed maybe hed do for my niece
dolly to lope around on of course
he aint much of a quadruped so the
price ought to be about right

  dont you fool yourself jim coun-
tered warmly which that white-nose
is a right good lioss strong pony too
six-year-old not a blemish on him or in
him he aint got a trick you cant
make him kick drive him too single
or double cant hitch him wrong
nawsir why that cayuse is worth any
two mules in the county

  thats what they all say sneered
pap ill bet hes past mark of mouth
you talkin business or to pass the
time

  business
the wagon wheel



  come along then and ill prove it
to you hes in the far corral

  so jim on foot and pap riding they
made their way to the far corral which
corral was distant from the house at
least a hundred yards at the corral
gate pap dismounted and dropped the
reins over his horses head jim started
to slip the gate-lever out of its wire loop

  wait a shake said pap touching
jims arm i can see him all right
from here

  you cant see his teeth all right from
here objected jim

  i was just fooling about his teeth
ill take your word for it jim bank
on your word any time everybody
knows you lets sit down on the log
and talk it over

  talk what over

  the price of the white-nose what
do you guess  right handy having this
log where it is can they see us from
the kitchen 

  both windows on that side lookin
right at us ida may is vvorkin at the
table by the right one now i can see
her cant you

  right plain but she cant see me
so plain cause the log bein end on
youre between me and the house

  whats that got-

  lemme finish jim lemme finish
youre slanchways to the kitchen all
right but youre facing that stand of
timber yonder how far would you
say it was from here to the timber
about fifty yards range

  pap smote his knee with delight
fifty yards range he says fifty
yards range you never said a truer
word in your life it is fifty yards
range

  what are you talking about de-
manded his fellow sitter

  suppose a man happened to be lying
over there behind a tree with a gun
continued pap just suppose huh
where would you be

  jim ferret elected to perceive another

pleasantry for the matter of that
where would you be

  me id be sittin on this log see
that patch of brush between those two
bullsaps fine place for a bushwhacker
you aint got any enemies jim
lets go back to the house said jim
and made as if to rise

  pap laid a detaining hand on his knee
no hurry lookit

  jim looked in the palm of paps
other hand snuggled a two-barreled der-
ringer pap was not actually pointing

the weapon at jim still-

  nice gun remarked pap small
handy efficient you aint wearin your
gun this morning i notice

  i wish i was jim declared fer-
vently

  lucky youre not you might get
hot-headed or somethin dont pay
gettin hot-headed lifes too short
no sense in making it shorter besides
you owe something to your family you
seem to like those kids of yours and
ill bet they like you too miss you a
lot they would likely if-if anything
happened look at that patch between
the bullsaps jim aint that a rifle
barrel  looks like it to me

  it was unmistakably a rifle barrel
protruding from the brush between the
two trees tim ferret sat very still

  if that winchester yonder should go
oft elaborated pap there couldnt any
blame attach to me here am i sitting
alongside you whoevers workin in
the kitchen would see that and theyd
see the puff of smoke over against the
brush between the bullsaps and theyd-
see-you-ivin-across-the-log and
right away theyd see me jump up
slide over behind the log and begin to
shoot at the woods defending you see
-or whats left of you

  jim ferret stared into the hard black
eyes of pap hawkins there was no
mercy in them whats all the shootin
for asked jim

  a lile matter of business explained
 



pap you and charlie shale have
made some kind of a deal together about
the next govment beef issue  was
counting on landing that contract my
own self are you sure you want that
contract 

   i dont care a damn about it jim
hastened to say

   no hard feelings i hope jim pur-
sued pap

how you mean no hard feelings
i mean no running around after-
ward and backing out of ibis bargain
i dunno what charlie will say mut-
tered the dispirited james

  now dont you worry your head
about charlie pap advised him sooth-
ingly til attend to charlie youll
find he wont mind a bit giving the con-
tract to me but you havent said you
wouldnt back out of the bargain after-
ward

  suppose i do

   in that case jim the first time you
go to town you wont get there if you
think im fooling gamble with me and
be sure when youre gambling with me
that you aint gambling with the welfare
of your wife and children be sure be
very sure of that jim well guess ill
be going sorry we cant agree about
the price of the white-nose remember
that the rifle in the underbrush will be
watching you till im out of sight i
wouldnt move if i were you for a
while sit and rest yourself you need
it

   so saying pap pocketed the derringer
stood up and strode to his horse
mounting he rode away unhurriedly
jim remained as instructed on the log he
sat upon till pap dropped from sight
behind a swell then he got to his stiff
legs and walked slowly to the house

   bill derr riding a barefooted horse
came to the hawkins ranch and dis-
mounted at the kitchen door mom a
big stirring spoon in her hand came t
the door

  peoples story magazine

   lo mis hawkins said derr
removing his hat

   lo returned mom

    i he li le horse cast both foreshoes
can  tack on a couple over at the
shop f

  sure help yourself shoe him all
around if you like if you need any-
thing holler

  thanks i will said bill

  bill derr rode over to the blacksmith
shop and dismounted his eyes were
very busy he was looking for straws
-the straws that show which way the
wind blows hitherto he had discovered
no sign of sile thompson or sile
thompsons horse he did not suspect
any one in particular of having made
away with sile but he suspected every
one in general-that is every one in that
region

  he made a fire in the forge and rat-
tled out shoes of the proper size with-
out much difficulty while he pulled
the lever of the bellows his eyes me-
chanically roamed the blacksmith shop
they flitted over and came back to an
almost new sideweight shoe with one
heel longer than the other

  derr immediately ceased blowing the
bellows and picked up the shoe he
turned it over and over in his hands ex-
amining it closely there was a dead
weight on his heart and red vengeance
in his brain for the shoe was the near
foreshoe of sile thompsons black
horse a blacksmith can always recog-
nize his own work and derr himself
had made this particular shoe for his
partners horse whose off fore interfered
badly

  and they said they hadnt seen sile
he muttered

  he looked about for the other shoes
of the set sile having been accustomed
to shoe all around at one shoeing but
he found no other shoes

  he put away the sideweight shoe in a
saddle pocket and went back to the forge
the wagon wheel



to heat his own shoes and think the mat-
ter out-if he could

  at the start there was one thing he
could not understand why should sile
pull off a perfectly good shoe especially
such a shoe as this sideweight that was
hard to make and moreover fitted the
hoof for the shoe had been pulled off
no doubt of it the nails were still in
the nail holes and there was no indica-
tion that a single one of them had
worked loose

  they couldnt work loose derr said
to himself my nails dont work
loose

  trampling of hoofs jingle of spur
rowels creak of saddle-leather a whiff
of cigarette smoke-pap hawkins and
two of his boys were riding past the
blacksmith shop on their way to the cor-
ral they called a greeting to derr and
he returned it

  i guess ill be going up to the house
after im through here and see what pap
has to say about it

  realizing well enough that the haw-
kins outfit might not confine their com-
ments to words he felt at the back of
his neck where a leather sheath contain-
ing a slim-handled heavy-bladed bowie
knife was sewn inside the back of his
vest he loosened the knife in its
sheath pulled the shoulder holster under
his armpit a trifle to the front and made
certain that the six-shooter hanging at
his right leg could be swiftly drawn
there were three of the hawkins bunch
perhaps four should thorn be at home
but he comforted himself with the
thought that the hand is sometimes
quicker than the eye

  he withdrew the shoe from the bed
of coals cherry-red he thrust it back
into the fire and looked about for the
hammer it was not leaning in its
proper place against the anvil nor was
it anywhere in the immediate vicinity

  then he saw the hammer it was ly-
ing across the shop against the wall
beside it was a pile of old sacks he

strode impatiently to the hammer
stooped to pick it up and overbalanced
himself he fell on his hands on top
of the sacks something clinked beneath
those sacks derr who under the cir-
cumstances was not disposed to leave
anything open to conjecture if he could
help it tossed the sacks to one side and
discovered a horse-hair bridle he
lifted it the bit rings and rein-chains
clinked the bridle was the bridle of
sile thompson

  a long moment he stared at it then
he put it where he had found it and re-
placed the sacks very carefully

  have some more coffee pap urged
hospitably

  derr refused and leaned back in his
chair and took out the makings mom
removed the coffeepot from the stove
and went to the door to throw out the
grounds dolly standing at the stove
was stirring the contents of a saucepan

  dont often see you in this part of
the country bill remarked pap haw-
kins thrusting a splinter of light wood
into the stove

  i have business up here sometimes
said derr

  youd think thered be enough busi-
ness down around seymour to keep a
man busy thus pap bulling right
along

  derr leaned back in his chair which
brought sim and hank within range of
his vision with pap getting personal
like this it was just as well to have an
eye on every male member of the fam-
ily mom too for that matter it was
to be observed that derr continued to
roll his cigarette this enabled him to
keep his fingers close to the left lapel of
his vest beneath which a six-shooter
nestled in the shoulder holster

  pap repeated his remark with empha-
sis

  derr grinned you would think so
pap you would think so but there
isnt always when times are slack a


peoples story magazine

feller lias to pick up and scatter around
where the business has gone to

  even then he doesnt always get the
business said tap

  so hawkins knew about the slash f
effort to land the beef contract did he
and was consequently prone to gloat
over the slash f failure derr jumped
right in with a splash

  no he doesnt always get the busi-
ness he drawled take these gov-
ment contracts now some folks get
em and some dont

  dollys arm paused at full stretch
then it went on slowly derr his eyes
on paps face heard the spoon scrape
against the side of the saucepan none
of the hawkins lot said anything

  sile thompson came up here to try
and get that contract continued derr
did he said pap

  yeah nodded derr and crossed his
legs the movement of his body
brought his right hand a shade nearer
the butt of his shoulder gun

  wouldnt shale give him the con-
tract either asked pap

  either was pap crazy or what
derr was watching pap closely but for
the life of him he could tell nothing
from paps expression

  i dont know said derr

  momentary surprise in the eyes of
pap i thought you said sile thomp-
son went to see charlie about it

  derr shook his head i didnt say
sile thompson went to see charlie
shale i said he came up here to try

and get that contract but-

  you mean here-to this house in-
terrupted pap not sharply but as one
desiring ordinary information

  derr shook an impatient head i
dont know where he came to natur-
ally he was going to see shale but he
didnt see shale-according to shale
whered he go this from hank
i dont know hank said derr i
wish i did you fellers havent seen
anything of him have you

  you took some time to ask that ques-
tion pap said swiftly

  youre taking some time to answer
it was the prompt come-back

  i aint seen him pap said shortly
you boys seen anything of sile thomp-
son 

  the boys said they hadnt

  satisfied now  demanded pap

  i aint complaining said derr

  alla same you took a long time
workin up to your question why
didnt you ask straight out in the be-
ginning if you wanted to know had we
seen thompson

  i ask my questions in my own way
derr told him calmly

  well i dont like your way pap
went on hardily i-

  put em up boys it was a voice
from the doorway speaking

  bill derr put up his hands in com-
pany with the others he recognized
the voice of top sawyer the sheriff of
fort creek county

  i aint going to put up my paws for
you or anybody else top sawyer de-
clared mom hawkins keeping right on
with her stirring

  why thats all right mom the
sheriff told her we aint got a thing
against you not a thing all we want
to do is ask pap and the boys some
questions

  damn funny way you got of asking
questions remarked pap casting his
eye about and observing that an armed
man stood outside of each window and
that at least seven more were crowding
at the sheriffs back i see you-all took
off your spurs he added

  so you wouldnt hear us explained
the sheriff needlessly we didnt want
to hurt anybody-if we could help it

  that was right thoughtful of you
patos accent was bitter

  wheres thorn 

  he went away last week-on busi-
ness

  he did huh maybe well have to
the vag on wheel



make him prove it-when he comes
back

  do you want to ask me some ques-
tions too derr inquired meekly

  yes replied sawyer and you can
put your hands down not you pap
sim and hank too keep em up till i
get your guns thatll do nicely pap
turn around sim thats the ticket
hank you seem to have hung yours up
are you packin a hideout lemme
look all right you can put em down
and sit down if you like

  thanks for the permission snarled
pap it you wanna ask your infernal
questions fly at it

  pap said the sheriff have you
seen anything of sile thompson lately
no i havent i never saw such a
bunch everybody comes and asks us
where sile thompson is do you think
we stole him

  who else has been asking where sile
is asked the sheriff sharply oh
him he continued as pap indicated bill
derr hes got a right to you two
boys seen anything of sile huh

  both boys repeated their earlier de-
nial

  all right said the sheriff well
have to search the house blacksmith
shop sheds and stable

  why do you think weve got sile
thompson hid away somewheres in-
dignation on the part of pap

  you havent got sile thompson hid
here

 then what-

  but youve got something belonging
to sile

  speakin offhand youre a liar and
if i had a gun id show you

  but you aint got a gun and well
talk about the liar part of it when you
have

  what are you drivin at top derr
put the question abruptly give it a
name

  i found sile thompsons body early
this morning

  derr nodded his face expressionless
i figured it would be that way hes
been missing so long whered you
find him

  back in the brush about a quarter-
mile north of the forks of the reserva-
tion and farewell roads

  why its all rocks there and the
damndest place to get to you cant
ride in

  he didnt ride in and he didnt walk
in he wtas dragged in the body was
covered with stones

  where is it now

  right there the coroner aint seen
it yet you cant move it till he does
what were you doing in those rocks
yourself derr probed

  i got a letter last night replied the
sheriff telling me where to look for
siles body and where to look for some
of siles belongings

  got the letter with you

  its in the safe at my office

  did the letter say what belongings
  it didnt say

  who wrote the letter

  i dont know it wasnt signed it
wasnt even written really it was all
printed out

  printed out huh derr stared at
the sheriff

  printed out yep

  what did you do with siles watch
and money

  no watch or money on him when we
found him there was part of his
watch chain still in his buttonhole-the
hook part and maybe four or five links
how long had sile been dead 
hard to say three-four maybe five
days

  derr nodded and turned away his
calm almost stoical expression gave no
intimation of the hot emotion that
seethed and bubbled within him sile
thompson his friend and partner dead
he had expected it in a way and yet
now that his worst fears had been real-
ized the blow was almost as shrewd as
 



peoples story magazine

though it had been totally unforeseen
he saw again sile as he rode out on
his trip to moon creek with a so
long tossed back over his shoulder
and now sile would never ride home
again nothing that lie could do would
bring sile back nothing tliat he could
do would ever outweigh the fact of
siles death he could not exact a fair
and equal payment in the only terms he
knew that of human life but he would
do what he could yes he would do
what he could

  the sheriff came to him where he
tood at a window looking out sure
is luck finding you here to-day bill
now you can traipse along with me and
identify right away anything of sites
we find and save us a lot of time
maybe

  youre mighty sure of finding some-
thing snarled the bitter-feeling pap

  i am sure said the sheriff tom
while were busy here you can take cal
and jack and homer and search the
blacksmith shop goldy i wish you and
dick would take the prisoners outdoors
theyll be under foot here

  well said mom to bill derr i
wondered what you came here for to-
day besides shoes for your hoss and
now i know playin the pup-dog for
the sheriff huh youre the sort of
snake that slimes round snoopin at key-
holes

  im worsen that gimme a chance
he told her calmly

  you and the sheriff are a fine pair
she pursued a fi-ine pair youre

- well she switched abruptly as

the sheriff stepped into the kitchen i
hope youre satisfied now-tearin the
house all up you didnt find anything
suspicious -did you

  the sheriff eyed her with complete
disfavor we may yet i aint any
too satisfied we aint searched the
stable and sheds t just sent some of
the boys to do that

  but the boys found nothing the
sheriff was incredulous did you
search everything he demanded
everything but a mow of hay

   and you didnt search that

   w hy for r it was a big mow
lls truc saying grumbled the
sheriff it you want a thing done right
do it yourself

  he stumped off to the stable followed
by some of his men derr sat down
on the washbench and rolled a ciga-
rette pap hawkins and his two
sons under guard were seated on the
ground a few yards distant

   ithin ten minutes derr saw the
sheriff issue from the stable dragging
a saddle ill bet you didnt half search
the blacksmith shop either  came faintly
to his ears

  sawyer strode to the blacksmith shop
he was in there at least fifteen minutes
a hen he came out he was carrying the
hair bridle that derr had found under
the pile of old sacks

  the sheriff hurried back to the house
and dumped the saddle and bridle on
the ground between the washbench and
the hawkins outfit derr inhaled
deeply for the saddle too was that of
his partner

  you see that saddle and bridle pap
intoned the sheriff who rather enjoyed
the sound of his own voice indicating
the articles with a spatulate thumb i
found the saddle hid under the hay in
your stable and i found the bridle hid
under a pile of sacks in the blacksmith
shop do they belong to you or any
of your family they dont huh you
never saw em before either did you
i thought not do you know why they
were hid away you dont huh all
right ill tell you they were hid away
because you or some of your outfit killed
sile thompson this is sile thomp-
sons saddle and bridle im sure ive
seen him usin em i could almost swear
to em

  almost aint quite sneered pap
the wagon wheel

   if i cant swear to em heres his
partner who can bill take a look at
that saddle and bridle and tell us who
they belong to

  derr squatted down and made a pre-
tense of examining the two articles he
stood up and faced the sheriff they
aint siles he said with finality

   what  cried the sheriff

  they aint sile thompsons dont
you guess id know the saddle and bridle
of my own partner the bridle is black
and white like siles but theres no yel-
low and red in it siles had a few yel-
low and red hairs in the cheek pieces
and the saddle is plain unstamped
leather like siles same old visalia tree
and oxbow stirrups too but this here
is a frazier saddle by the stamp and
siles was made by billy bolander way
down in santa fe this aint siles
saddle or his bridle either

chapter vii

  pap hawkins glared around the
family circle what i want to know
is why didnt bill derr identify that
saddle 

  you think that was sile thompsons
saddle and bridle asked hank

  sure they were sneered pap with
all an opinionated mans contempt for
a dull mentality anv fool could see
that

  then why didnt he identify em
hank asked bewilderedly

  didnt i say thats what i want to
know why didnt he why didnt
he he aint got any reason to be good
friends with us and on top of that and
this killing siles saddle and bridle turn
up on our place and then bill derr
dont recognize em never saw em
before no not him and he reels off a
speech about billy bolander and santa
fe and red and yellow hairs till the
sheriffs case against us aint got one
leg to scratch another with and lop
has to turn us loose now why did bill

do that huh whats he think it will
get him

  i dont know said sim and i
dont care what interests me is who
planted that saddle and bridle on our
place

  the same man who wrote the anony-
mous letter to the sheriff who else
sim scratched his tousled head you
may be right

  i know im right whod you guess
would do a thing like that to us

  jim ferret hazarded hank

  pap shook his head not him he
might bushwhack one of us to get
square but killin sile and throwing the
blame on us is too roundabout be-
sides he didnt have anything against
sile

so far as you know persisted sim
so far as i know but i dont think
it was jim it dont look like his style
somehow weve got other enemies
we have admitted sim soberly
whoever it was the feller was an
enemy of siles too said hank

  you think so pap observed with
sarcasm you think maybe he had a
grudge against sile huh well maybe
youre right hank anyway seeing as
youre so jo-awful bright make another
throw and tell us who the feller is
aw quit ridin me grunted hank
youre always ridin me ridin me i

only said-

  never mind what you only said
well take your word for it there
aint a one of us got any idea who killed

sile-

  wait a minute interrupted sim
how about thorn

  thorn repeated pap

  thorn this trick that has just been
played on us and sile is a good deal
like the trick were trying to turn for
thorns benefit suppose now thorn
he wants to get rid of us hes got
brains-some and this trick is about
what hed think of too besides hed
have it in for sile knowing that the
 

peoples story magazine

slash i- was trying to get that contract
thorn was always a great boy for kill-
ing two birds with one stone

  pap gnawed his nether lip- h i

thought thom did it id-

  depend on it he did it struck in
hank hed do anything thorn would
regular he-devil

  paps expression cleared youre
alwavs jumping to conclusions he told
hank we havent a smidgin of proof
against thorn not a smidgin i dont
believe hed do it

  if wed cold-deck him why wouldnt
he cold-deck us  sim asked shrewdly

  but pap had taken his stand i
dont think so it was somebody else
besides thorn has been gone too long

  we dont know that either per-
sisted sim we dont know when sile
thompson was killed

  i heard bill derr talking to the sher-
iff this afternoon supplied hank
after he turned us loose yunderstand
and top he said sile hadnt been dead
more than five days when he found him
so thats that it could have been thorn
we dont know he went south

  its no use guessing any now said
pap we got something more impor-
tant than that to think about our lile
relative dolly yeah plow we gonna
persuade her to do what we want huh 
damfino said hank frankly

  shes stubborn as a mule was sims
contribution short of kicking the
pants off her i dont know how youre
going to swing her i dont no
and of course we dont want to hurt
her pap said casually his wicked old
eyes gleaming at sim

  sure not assented sim

  id like to said hank shes the
damndest sassiest petticoat that ever
gave a man back-slack but you cant
wallop her even if she needs it it
would get around give us a bad name
youre devilish careful of our good
name all of a sudden pap was incau-
tious enough to sneer

  sim gave his father a quick look
pap caught it out of the corner of his
eye and veered like a windblown vane

  youre a lile hard on dolly hank
said pap shes a good girl and does
almost all the work  don t know that
shes any worse than any other female
theyll all jaw at you for the matter
of that but we got to think of some-
thing

  sim stared in wonder al pap here
was his father actually praising dolly
he couldnt understand it pap per-
ceived as much so he leaned lack in
his chair and yawned with a great as-
sumption of indifference

  well well let it go for now said
pap well think of something later
how about a short drink boys

  huh grunted hank sniffing sus-
piciously youve had several already
by the smell of your breath

  well whos got a better right
snapped back his father a sudden smol-
der of wildfire in his eve

  wheres the bottle then i didnt
know you had any left

  so you been snoopin huh

  i just happened to look

  yeah i know how you just happened

to look yeah i- aw hell whatsa

use i got three bottles hid out ill
get em nemmine followin me

  he must have brought them back
from town last time offered sim when
pap was gone

  naturally assented hank

  and last time was two weeks ago
he must have been saving em up for-
for-

  for what id like to know inter-
rupted hank suddenly starting off with
a rush it aint like our pap to be so
generous with his redeye most likely
he wants us to do something for him
well vou can gamble if he expects me
to do something for him in exchange for
a measly drink of corn liquor he s got
another guess

  sim said nothing hank was always
the wagon wheel



talking always hail a grievance fre-
quently comment was not worth while

  pap returned with a bottle in each
hand and clanked them down on the
table top hank squinted quizzically
i thought you said you had three
theyre quart bottles pap said
equably but if two aint enough ill
get the third

   aint enough  repeated sim
aint enough for what

  for a session pap answered with
a disarming smile but i guess two
will do us we dont want to get too
pie-eyed

  he fetched glasses and pulled the
cork of the first bottle with his teeth
he filled the glasses all around drink
hearty boys he said lifting his glass
his stiff beard twitched as he swilled
down the strong liquor the wildfire
in his eyes glowed a little brighter he
smiled expansively and struck the table-
with the heel of a heavy hand

  sim over the rim of his glass re-
garded him with frank curiosity he
recognized the signs something was
on paps mind what but he did not
long continue to wonder the liquor
was too good and too handy for a fel-
low to waste time speculating on the
answer to a futile question neither
sim nor hank noticed that pap while
he continued to shove about the bottle
was not drinking any more it must
be remembered that pap was a little
drunk to start with

  i dont know how were going to
bring dolly to our way of thinking
said pap suddenly

  me neither hank chimed in pass
the bottle pap

  sim made no comment pap bent a
sly eye upon sim shell have to be
made proffered pap hawkins

   shell have to agree said sim

  even if we have to wallop her by
gawd  declared pap

  wallop her-

  why not whats a licking aint

she my niece aint i her uncle and
guardian i guess i got a right to
whang her if she refuses to do what i
say you bet i have aw dont be
so nasty-nice about it sim shes only
a damn girl

  thats just it she-

  rats whats the dif look what
it means to us just look spose now
we dont get those contracts what
then  a fine mess well be in  a fi-ine
mess i tell you theres no other wagon
track out dolly has got to do what we
say here have another fill up
dont be afraid of it

  sim and hank both filled the liq-
uor already in them was doing its work
the sense and sensibilities of both were
dulled pap was right it was neces-
sary that dolly be amenable to their
plans if she should prove contuma-
cious so much the worse for her ex-
actly

  they had another on the strength of
it it did not make them drunk-this
last drink but it made them utterly
careless of consequences pap thought
he perceived as much he leaned for-
ward across the table

  listen- he began

  the door opened dolly entered
pap turned in his chair with a hearty
curse what do you want he de-
manded

  my fiddle she flung back tartly
i left it in here last night

  the fiddle and the bow were lying on
a chair in the corner of the room pap
quick as a cat had them in his hands
before the girl was halfway across the
room

  im sick of you and your fiddle he
bellowed this is the last time youll
leave it here or anywhere else

  so saying pap whirled up the fiddle
and brought it clown smash on a chair
back he dropped the shattered instru-
ment on the floor and snapped the bow
across his knee

  there he said kicking the splintery
 

remains with a contemptuous toe take
your fiddle-

  for a loig minute dolly did not move
her eyes wide open staring were fixed
on her uncles face she did not speak
then abruptly she stooped gathered
the broken bits of wood in her apron
and left the room

you hadnt ought to have done that
said sim when the door was closed
she hadnt ought to have inter-
rupted replied fap and swore again
ill teach her to mind her own business

listen here- and pap slipped into

his chair and began to buzz

  what happened the day charlie
shale was here thus pap hawkins
giving his wife a lasilisk stare

 what happened how you mean-
what happened

  you know what i mean what did
dolly do to make shale mad

  oh nothing pap what makes you
think she did something

   oh nothing pap says you mim-
icked pap nothing a-tall well
mis innocence what did she do

i told you nothing persisted mom
i know you told me nothing and you
better tell me something or ill give you
something you aint had for a long long
time

  she didnt do anything to shale
mom insisted hardily

  pap made a long arm seized mom by
the wrist and dragged her toward him
youre taking her part thats what
youre doing do you want a licking
no i dont want a licking but i
cant tell you any different about dolly
you can peel my hide off if you like
and ill only tell you i dont know that
dolly did anything to make shale mad
pap looked from mom to the quirt
hanging from the antlers plainly he
was of two minds as to the advisibility
f beating mom then he flung her
wrist from him

  mom  said he get you a fish pole

  peoples story magazine

and go down to the creek and catch a
mess of fish

   got too much to do around the
house objected mom

  never mind what you got to do
dolly will do it for you same a usual
go and fish

 but-

  	go on

  mom continued to stand her ground
she saw that pap was not quite sober

 hs breath was rank with the odor of
whisky what you going to do to
dolly she demanded

  it was then that sim entered the
kitchen he stood teetering on his heel
in the doorway and grinned wickedly at
his mother

  what am i going to do to dolly
laughed pap what a question i
aint gonna do a thing to her

  mom took instant alarm you aint
gonna touch that girl  she cried
who says i aint

  i do

  oh you do do you  vnd who are
you id like to know

  mom swallowed hard obviously she
was frightened to death yet she
braced up to her lord and master you
aint gonna hurt her

  aw whos going to hurt her
squalled pap youve been drinking
again youre imagining things i
wouldnt hurt that dolly girl for quite
a lot take my word for it now you
go and get that mess of fish

  i wont im going to stay right
here youre up to something i know
that or you wouldnt be afraid to let
me stay here you-youre drunk-all
three of you you been tanking up for
the last hour i saw you fetchin in

those two bottles i-

  better go mom cut in sim ou
can come back in about three hours

  mom gulped three hours then
you arc going to do something to her
her voice rose to a shriek dolly
dolly run run theyre after you
the wagon wheel



  pap laughed aloud you poor flap
dollys over in the blacksmith shop with
hank-and the door shut she cant
hear a word and if she could what good
would it do hadnt thought of that
huh  no i guess not run along now
and catch that mess of fish

  mom realized that she was beaten
and beaten before she even started ill
go she mumbled but if you hurt that
lile girl pap hawkins youll regret it
to your dying day if thorn was

here-

  aw stop your croaking and sift
along

 when pap and sim had seen mom
well on her way to the creek they went
to the blasksmith shop from which
place was issuing the merry clangor of
hammer and anvil entering they
found hank shaping a horseshoe and a
very sullen dolly blowing the bellows
in the forge fire a second horseshoe was
heating

  didnt i hear mom yell a while back
sim dolly asked completely ignoring
pap

  guess not weve been right there
with her till she just now went fishing
she aint hardly said a word

  i thought i heard her yelling but i
wasnt sure and hank said he didnt
hear anything he wouldnt stop ham-
mering so i could listen though i
could have sworn i heard her voice
your mistake dolly said sim
rolling shut the heavy door of the black-
smith shop

  for heavens sake sim cried dolly
crossly do you want to roast us lord
im dripping now

  she stopped pulling the lever of the
bellows and wiped her perspiring face
i dont see why you couldnt help hank
sim she continued sulkily havent
i got enough to do in the house without
piling a blacksmiths helpers job on top
of me im not twins and hanks half
drunk besides yes you are too
drunk think i cant tell youve got

a breath like a distillery and you dont
know what youre doing look at you
right this minute you poor sot
wheres the sense in hammering that
shoe now youve lost the heat put it
in the fire and take the other shoe

  i guess i wont need that other shoe
right away said hank laying down
the tongs and hammer and plunging
his forearms into the cooling tub

  dont be so finicky hank pap
said impatiently

  lemme wash my hands will you
think i want to get my sleeves all dirty
there aint any rush about this

  do you want to burn up the shoe in
the fire  snapped dolly failing to com-
prehend the trend of the conversation

  never mind the shoe in the fire
said pap listen here dolly ive got
a proposition to make to you how
would you like to marry charlie shale 
no more than i would thorn you
old beast was the prompt reply ac-
companied by a glare of frank disgust

  it would help us a lot if youd marry
shale

  it wouldnt help me any

  wed take it as a favor

  dolly folded her arms and squarely
faced pap i wont marry him thats
flat

  whats the use of fooling with her
demanded hank wiping his arms dry
on his trouser legs coaxing wont
work

  i know it wont but i want to give
her every chance always be as easy
with the ladies as you can is my motto
then nothing i can say will make you
change your mind dolly

  nothing declared dolly

  grab her hank

  hank obeyed by jamming his knee
into the small of her back and pinioning
her arms at which there was a hurri-
cane of growls in a far corner of the
shop and dollys dog which had been
dozing on a pile of sacks flew at hank
peoples story magazine

he fastened on hanks leg hank
swore and kicked

  pull him off roared hank pull
him off hes biting right through

  lt was pap who responded by pluck-
ing up a length of strap iron and bring-
ing it down full sweep across the little
dogs back feller his spine fractured
lost his hold and fell away but only
for an instant the brindle body was
broken but the stout scotch heart was
not it was as full as ever of fury
against the man who had laid hands on
the beloved mistress snarling weakly
trailing his useless hindquarters suffer-
ing the most exquisite torture the de-
voted little dog dug in his forepaws and
dragged himself anew to the attack

  dolly had not seen the blow that
smashed her pets back but now when
she saw him in his helpless agony as
hank kicked him in the ribs and drove
him six feet she shrieked terribly

  pap completed the wretched work by
nipping up the dog by the hind legs and
flailing him smack against the horn of
the anvil with a most hellish grin
that bared his teeth to the gums pap
pitched the pitiful dead thing that had
been dollys dog upon the very pile of
sacks where he had been sleeping not
two minutes before

  first your fiddle then your dog
youre next said pap hawkins

  the truly horrific sight of the killing
of her dog had held her spellbound
but as if paps words had been an elec-
tric current she was galvanized into life
-and the most violent kind of life

  lithe as a wild cat and considerably
stronger she twisted her back sidewise
snapped her body forward and down-
ward and threw hank over her head
his clutching hands were torn loose as
he flew through the air struck pap be-
low the knees and threw him heavily
dolly instantly whipped up the hammer
and flung it at sim the latter ducked
the hammer crashed against the logs
at the far end of the shop dolly sprang

to tlie window opposite the door she
was halfway through it before pap who
had scrambled to his feet with amazing
quickness seized her by the ankles she
kicked him in the chest and sent him
staggering backward but she couldnt
break his hold and lie pulled her back-
ward with him so that she fell on her
hands and knees amid the old iron of
the smithy

  i hen sim was upon her and whipped
her right arm behind her back twisting
it till she had to clench her teeth to keep
from groaning

  drag her up on her feet directed
pap well show this young lady
whos boss around here  we-ugh
the grunt was wrung from the depths
of his being by one of the young ladys
heels which had kicked him in the pit of
the stomach pap gave ground tempo-
rarily

  youre a line pair jeered sim its
a good thing for you two im here or
shed be stuffing you both into the fire
and burning you up whats the mat-
ter hank feeling sick huh pap
you look kind of green

 she-kicked-me-in-the - stom-
ach pap explained jerkily  be-all
-right-in-a-minute

  lemme go panted dolly lemme
go

  will you promise to marry shale
asked sim twisting her arm a little
youd better be quiet youll only
hurt yourself twisting and jerking this
a way if you kick me again ill twist
your arm off

  she did kick him again and he did
twist her arm-twisted it till the tears
ran down her cheeks and she really be-
lieved that she would faint with the
pain yet no cry escaped her

  her brain was curiously active
what would they do to herj why
didnt hank change his shirt once in a
while hed worn the one he had on
two weeks at least she wished sim
had shaved that morning she could
the wagon wheel



feel his stubby chin on the back of her
neck what queer eyes pap had they
seemed to smolder as they glared at
her there was a button missing from
his shirt his hair hung over his ears
more than it should it looked as if it
had never been combed probably it
hadnt not in the last-few years any-
way what a beast he was yet he
had seemed kindly enough when he took
her to live with him you never could
tell no you certainly couldnt what
were they going to do with her if
sim twisted her arm a sixteenth of an
inch more shed scream she knew t-he
would or faint probably the latter
her stomach felt queer and strings of
black spots danced before her eyes
hank was getting up he was rubbing
his head and swearing at her

  all ready said pap yonders
the rope hanging on that nail

  did they intend to hang her was
that it no that wasnt it but it was
something only a degree milder

  at one end of the blacksmith shop
stood the rear axle of a freight wagon
complete with its two heavy wheels all
that was left of a wagon that had been
struck by lightning the three men
dragged the girl to one of the wheels
spread-eagled her facing the wheel and
made fast her wrists and ankles with
the rope

  you still refusing to marry shale
inquired pap

  i wont marry him she declared
in a strangled voice

  from a nail on the wall pap took
down a one-team mule whip which be
it known is shorter than the two-and-
three-team whips but quite long enough
to fulfill the purpose pap had in mind
the man took his stand behind and to
the left of dolly

  the girl squirming her head around
to the left saw what he held in his right
hand she saw him draw back his right
arm and swing it forward the whip
sang through the air she closed her

eyes and jammed her forehead against
the felloe of the wheel then she felt
the most hideous pain she had ever felt
in all her life the shock of it almost
stopped the beating of her heart again
paps right arm drew back and swung
again the whip bit into her soft flesh
again she felt as though she were about
to die from the stripes across her
back the furious burning smart spread
up and down her whole body but she
continued to hold her head hard down
against the felloe

  a third time pap brought down the
whip across her back

  dolly shivered all over her head
fell back her body sagged it was
only kept from falling by her two wrists
bound to the felloe of the w-heel

  shes fainted said hank

  dollv opened her eyes she had not
fainted dully she beheld the face of
hank peering into her own her cousin
hank who was helping pap to beat her
her head rolled to the left there was
her other cousin sim sim who had
done her more than one kindness in the
past before-before this happened
suddenly she realized with a clarity of
vision that amazed her that this w-as
the turning-point of her life it could
not be a bare quarter of an hour since
that she had blown the bellows for
hank yet it was a long long while
ago she was not the same girl either
and never would be aside from the
terrific pain she felt both physically and
mentally different paps whip while it
had taken away from her something that
could never be put back had not swung
the pendulum one way only it had
given her something too it had given
her hitherto purposeless existence a
purpose pap came to her side his
subconscious mind must have read some
hint of that purpose in her eyes for he
jerked up his head involuntarily

  afraid shell bite you gibed sim

  pap cursed him then dolly have
you changed your mind yet


peoples story magazine

  silence  her pari while her eyes
stared sidewise into his

  he put the question in a different
form will you marry shale

  she shook her head slightly

  if you wont promise im going to
whale you till you do said he

  she knew he would yet she shook
her head a second time

  gag her cried pap savagely

  it was done and pap began to lay
on the whip with all his might

  not in the same place corrected
sim angrily you cut her too deep and
she wont heal up in two weeks

  close your trap snarled pap i
know my business

  shes fainted this time all right de-
clared hank

  his infuriated father paid no atten-
tion he continued to thrash dollys
unconscious body till the door burst
open and a fat whirlwind blew in and
fastened two hands on his right arm

  pap pap screamed the an-
guished mom beat me if you gotta
beat somebody beat me but leave
dolly alone  oh leave her alone dont
hit her again dont oh youve
killed her youve killed her i know
it

  aw shut up he bellowed at mom
she aint hurt shes only shamming
leggo i tell you go fix her up if you
want to tie her loose sim help him
hank dont stand there like a thumb-
suckin bump on a log

  derr squatting on his heels stared
down at the body of his friend sile
thompson the coroner and his jury
had not yet arrived nate main and
hap green the sheriffs deputies were
keeping derr company derrs face was
inscrutable it might have been cut out
of hard rock but the eyes were as
bright and alert as those of a bobcat

  when derr spoke his voice was mo-
notonous and gentle almost soft this
just the way he was found nate

  except for the rocks we took off
him replied the deputy

  he aint been dead as long as the
sheriff aid declared derr

   dont think he has myself spoke
hap green two days at the outside

i op he didnt make allowance for the
weather

  derr fingered the broken watch chain
it was an old-fashioned watch chain with
a hook instead of the more usual button-
hole bar it was obvious that a sudden
wrench had snapjed the worn links

  nate leaned forward to look over his
shoulder derr said to the deputy the
links are pretty well worn thin it
wouldnt take much of a yank to bust
em

  the holdup must have been in a
hurry nate offered as his opinion

  w hoever dragged him in here had
time enough to cover him up with
rocks said derr glancing at the two-
foot heap of stones beside the body if
he didnt have to hustle he didnt have
to break the chain hed have unhooked
it

  but it is busted

  it is busted how come

  ill never tell you second sight is
something i dont own to

  find the answer to why this watch
chain is busted instead of unhooked and
youll go a long way toward dumping
the murderer in a deal like this its
the unnatural happenings you want to
look into most the things that dont
fit see 

  what do you think

  he wasnt robbed thats a cinch
but his money and watch are gone
didnt i just tell you that the killer
had plenty of time-time enough any-
way theres a good ounce of gold in
this hook and these few links if sile
had been robbed the hook and links
would be missing too

  nate subsided such reasoning was
beyond his powers he watched derr
peel down the dead mans shirt and un-
the agon wheel



der shirt on the white skin were long
discolored abrasions

  see those rope marks pointed out
derr he was packed to the edge of
the rocks on a horse why didnt you
say so before nate

  i never saw the rope marks before
defended nate neither did top or
any of us  e saw he was cashed and
let it go at that me i aint undressin
any dead folks if i can help it i-
where you goin

  see if i can track the pack horse
derr tossed back over his shoulder

  derr the man hunter slipped and slid
across the tumbled rocks and boulders
and tore his way through crackling
brush to the edge of the stony patch
here he began to quarter the ground
like a hunting dog the deputies fol-
lowed but they were not the trailers for
such a delicate job as this

  stay back on the rocks he bade
them if you come walking around
youll blot the trail

  the patch was over two acres in area
consequently there was a deal of
ground for derr to cover he might
be compelled almost to encircle the patch
before he struck a mark that he would
strike a trail he was almost certain
for a led horse presaged another horse
he said as much to the deputies

  maybe he packed him in front of his
saddle suggested hap green

  in that case hed have held him on
and where would the ropes come in
there are two horses anyway hap
its the horses we have to depend on
the ground is too hard for human foot-
marks but a horses hoofs will nick it
enough to make a showing especially
if theyre shod

  a spreading shadow absorbed his own
shadow and fled on across the face of
the land he looked up at the sky
torn greasy gray shreds of storm-scud
were streaming ahead of a rapidly ad-
vancing storm cloud nothing could
have been more unchancy even as he
qbpeo

looked a lightning flash ripped across
the black heart of the dusky mass of
cumulo-stratus the thunder crashed
and with it crashed his hopes

  a raindrop smacked his cheek

  within thirty seconds it was pouring

  no use said derr rejoining the
deputies and crowding in with them un-
der an inadequate slicker spread over
their heads five minutes of this
would wash out a wagon track

  this is sure a fright commented
hap green it only rained four days
ago

  two rains within a week in that coun-
try are almost as remarkable as siamese
twins or a six-legged calf it frequently
does not rain twice during the whole of
the summer

  when the very elements seem to go
out of their way to fight against you
you are vastly out of luck nor is there
anything more maddening to the aver-
age mortal man he is so helpless
poor puny person but derr had
hunted too many men to be in the least
discouraged by the setback fate had
dealt him a poor hand this round that
was all the next time perhaps the
cards would run better if not the next
time then the time after that

chapter viii

  bill derr blew into marysville at
the tail of a three-day southerly wind-
storm he had heard that a horse thief
languished in the marysville calaboose
said horse thief who bestrode a most
excellent unbranded black having been
sufficiently ill-advised to run off seven
head of bar s stock it was derrs in-
tention to have a look at the horse thiefs
personal mount the horse sile thomp-
son rode to his death was an unbranded
black

  on his arrival he discovered that the
marysville citizens their tempers run
ragged by the three-day storm had
lynched the horse thief and turned over


peoples story magazine

the black horse together with the seven
bar s horses to the bar s punchers
the black horse was by this time some-
where on the lazy river range

  derr decided to give his tired mount
a few hours rest and went to pass the
time of day with his friend ions
cooper the town marshal lhe latter
was sitting hunched up on the steps of
the calaboose he appeared unhappy
strewn about like spillikins were split
and splintered planks of what had been
a strong jail door immediately the
marshal began to pour a stream of woe
into derrs right ear

  which i dont mind their stretching
the feller the town marshal said in
part but they neednt have used a
wagon tongue on the calaboose door
they knew mighty well id let em take
the keys any time to lynch a horse thief
but did they even think of askin me
not them they had to act violent and
bust the door all to kindlings look
at it just look at it nothing but the
lock set

  boys will be boys observed derr
rolling a philosophic cigarette

  but they neednt be thoughtless
boys said the marshal now like as
not ill have to pay for that door be-
sides takin the prisoner home with me
and then my wife will raise hell shes
so refined eliza is dont like to have
criminals round the house nawsir
prisoner huh thought that horse
thief was the only one

  no theres another boy he is
tried to get away when they drug out
the horse thief but he ran right past
my house while i was sitting on the
front step yeah stick your head in
the doorway you can see him over in
the corner

  derr obeyed dimly he saw in one
corner of the musty calaboose a slight
figure huddled the knees were drawn
up the hands were finger-locked round
them the shining eyes set in the dirty
young face stared at him defiantly the

boy wore a coat derr wondered why
it was a blazing hot day outdoors and
the one-story-and-no-attic jail was an
oven

  hes only a kid said derr with-
drawing his head and easing himself
down on the step beside the marshal
whats he done

   ried to beat the stage company out
of a ride to the railroad didnt have
any money he told the farewell agent
but he was going to meet his brother at
blossom brother being a mining engi-
neer which last was a little too thin
lecatise if theres any mines round blos-
som  dont know em but that fare-
well agent always was a fool anyway
he let the kid ride and gave highpock-
ets orders to collect from brother well
iiighpockets he caught the kid skipping
out not a mile from here so iiighpockets
tied him up prompt and brought him
along and turned him over to me when
he pulled in of course there aint any
brother at blossom not a smidgin of
one

  there might be a brother said
derr you cant tell

  oh there aint thats a cinch de-
clared the marshal

  its none of your business anyway
the voice of the prisoner snapped rag-
gedly derr marked the hysterical note
and wondered for the average wayfarer
in the west is not given to a display of
nerves a certain tone of the voice
struck him as familiar he wondered at
that too

got a temper said the marshal
and ill have to take it home with me
till the doors fixed being a marshal
is no job for a married man nawsir
had a hearing yet

  not till this afternoon judge wtn-
dus played draw till sunrise so there
wasnt any court this morning lost
three hundred to the indian agent i
heard

  is he in town

  the marshal nodded pushing his
the ivagon wheel

stomach ahead of him all over the place
huh oh sure he sifts in for a
drunk and other relaxation most reg-
ular how about a lile food bill
youre eating with me and the pris-
oner

  sure acquiesced derr indifferently
the marshal slapped his knees and
stood up cmon kid he said to the
one within

  i dont want anything to eat de-
clared the prisoner

  youll feel different when the grubs
in front of you the marshal told him
good-humoredly you cmon

  ill stay here

  i cant let you do that said the mar-
shal wearily im responsible for you
and i have to go home to eat so you
just naturally got to come with me
aint he a pup the marshal added to
derr contrary worsell a woman
if he wasnt so skinnylike id kick the
pants off him good and plenty

  the marshal entered the jail and laid
hands  the skinny ones collar and
shook him upright you gonna be sen-
sible or will i drag you 

  derr looked at the prisoner dispas-
sionately it was none of his business
how the marysville marshal ruled his
guests but if it were himself now-
well sir hed take the stubbornness out
of the kid in short order he didnt
believe in coddling prisoners not he
while he gazed the marshal without
waiting for a reply to his question began
to propel the prisoner toward the door
the boy held back he staged a feeble
attempt at a struggle this the marshal
easily defeated by jerking the prisoners
left wrist behind the back and bending
the forearm upward the boy winced
he was now close to the door derr saw
his dark blue eyes bright with unshed
tears there was no defiance in those
eyes but there was terror-terror and
something more pitiful a poignant grief
that was obvious even to the hard-bitten
derr



iai

  cry baby said derr to himself and
at the same time felt unaccountably
enough sorry for the youngster cant
be more than seventeen or eighteen he
thought and got up to make room

  the owner of the dance hall and one
of her girls were passing by they
stopped to look the prisoner stum-
bling over the sill caught their stares
ill be good he told the marshal in
a low tone

  the marshal nodded and released the
imprisoned wrist youd better he
drawled grimly retaining his grasp on
the others collar come round to the
front while i put the cuffs on you
the prisoners body stiffened he
stopped short the dance-hall girls
were still staring the discouraged
shoulders slumped forward without
protest he allowed the marshal to shove
him round the jail and into the front
room where the marshal kept his hand-
cuffs notices of rewards and other odds
and ends connected with his office

  a moment laier the two emerged the
prisoner wearing the handcuffs you
dont have to hold me now do you
queried the prisoner in a flat dead
monotone the prisoner had appa-
rently fought down his hysteria derr
began to feel more comfortable he had
been fearful that the fellow would pub-
licly burst into tears

  i guess youre safe now said the
marshal his hand dropping right
across the street

  nice lookin kind of the dance-hall
girl observed in a perfectly audible tone
as the prisoner and the marshal crossed
the slatted sidewalk

  ye-es admitted the owner a line of
puzzlement between her handsome eye-
brows as she gazed after the two

  dont look much like a dead beat
went on the first woman but you
never can tell ive seen them youd
think butter wouldnt melt in their
mouths and if the truth was known-


peoples story magazine

shucks jails too good for em come
along dora

  dora came along but turned her head
fur another look at the prisoner the
dawdling derr who wished to give the
marshals wife ample time to blow off
steam before he appeared wondered
vaguely at doras unusual display of
interest maybe she thinks she knows
him he thought and for the time be-
ing the matter fled his mind

  the marshal nudged his prisoner with
a comforting elbow lat up eat up

i took the cuffs off you didnt   vhat
more do you want

  i aint hungry thus the boy sul-
lenly

  and a good thing too spoke up
the marshals shrew of a wife clat-
tering stove lids if theres one thing
makes me sicker than mustard and water
its cookin for a criminal and a dirty
gormed-up criminal at that why didnt
you wash your face when you washed
your hands

  the prisoners blue eyes glinted dan-
gerously his fingers curved talonwise
derr spading sugar into his third cup
of coffee was beginning to find points
of interest in this prisoner for the lat-
ter was undoubtedly an odd number
why should he cease making a row as
soon as he saw himself observed by two
dance-hall girls whether one of the
dance-hall girls was a friend or not
why didnt he eat something in spite
of the shrews tongue sauce with which
the food was served it was undeniably
excellent which excellence by the
way was unusual in that time and place

  the marshal proffered the makings
have a smoke he urged

  but the boy would not shaking a de-
cided head another oddity thought
derr the boy put up a hand to the
side of his head drew the hand back
as if shot and glanced sharply at the
marshals wife who happened to be look-
ing out of the window a look of re-

lief vied with the sorrow in the blue
eyes the eyes slid round to derr and
caught him staring instantly the re-
lief was displaced by fear rampant fear
another point of interest derr sat
back in his chair and inspected fur a
space the ceiling when he dropped
his eyes the prisoner was still watching
him furtively certainly there was
something familiar about the grimy fea-
tures of the boy even as there was about
his voice

   derr purposely began to stare the
red hair too was familiar but not the
haircut it was a wretched haircut
apparently the barber had employed
sheep shears the eyebrows perfect
crescents were dark almost black odd
combination red hair and dark eye-
brows where was it that he had seen
such a combination it was recently
he was positive and as derr spurred
his memory the answer to the puzzle
began to shape itself in the back of his
mind

   cheer up cheer up entreated the
marshal whose full stomach made him
feel at peace with the world i dont
believe the judge will give you more n
thirty days

   then youll get that jail door fixed
prompt and soon snapped the mar-
shals wife if you think im gonna
cook three meals a day for thirty days
ninety meals count em you mush-face
for any criminal you got another guess
go get that door fixed by to-morrow
noon or ill lean a frying pan against
your ear you hear me whistling
no call to get het liza soothed
the marshal weve got to do the best
we can thats all and--

   you get that door fixed to-night
   you said to-morrow noon

  i changed my mind

 but-

   if i have to change my mind again
ill change your features at the same
time
the wagon wheel

loo

  lets go said the marshal pluck-
ing the prisoner by the sleeve

   they went but not in any sense as the
marshal intended

  the prisoner slid lithely to his feet
and struck the marshal under the chin
with the heel of his hand the marshal
half in and half out of his chair was
caught off balance and went over with
a crash before the marshal hit the floor
the prisoner was jackknifing over the
window sill the marshals wife suf-
ficiently annoyed as she was with her
husband was not one to stand by quietly
while he was mishandled she flung
the frying pan it was good line but
over the frying pan smashed through
both the upper and lower sashes show-
ered the shoulders of the fleeing pris-
oner with broken glass and came to rest
in the dust of the street

  derr who had sprung to his feet
hurled himself through the window a
short length behind the prisoner he
was in good time to see the prisoner
dash plump into the arms of the indian
agent charlie shale which tall and
yellow-faced citizen uttered a whoof of
surprise and threw both arms round the
prisoner this was pure instinct and
done solely to save himself from falling

  lemme go cried the prisoner

  why-uh-how stuttered shale
surprise wrinkling his forehead what
the-

  hold him hold him screeched
the incensed marshal scrambling
through the window and dragging out
his gun

  derr in the middle of the sidewalk
said nothing instead he watched the
indian agent with a cold and calculat-
ing eye he swore under his breath as
the prisoner began a furious struggle
with the agent for the latter at first
loosening his grasp had tightened it at
the marshals screech the prisoner
uttering a moan of rage kicked the
agents shins clavved the side of his neck
and hit his arm severely the agent

let go with an oath the prisoner
dodged under his elbow derr with
great presence of mind sprang in front
of the marshal and masked his artillery
the prisoner sped round the corner of
the house derr the agent and the mar-
shal sped after him

  rage lent wings to the feet of the
marshal and the agent but it was derr
who caught the prisoner as he ran be-
hind the back of the marshals corral -
you little fool derr whispered
panting holding the others wrists
you keep quiet and ill get you out
of this somehow stop it do you
want em to find out

  the prisoner desisted from the vain
struggle -i think shale knows
shut up thus derr the two oth-
ers coming up at this juncture

  the marshal reached for the pris-
oner derr as though by accident
swung in front of the prisoner the
indian agent seized the marshals arm
no unnecessary roughness tom he
advised in a genial tone utterly at vari-
ance with his sharp-looking eyes treat
him gently this feller looks sick to
me

  sick squalled the marshal sick
youd think he was sick if he lammed
you under the chin the way he did me
sick if im never any sicker than he
is ill live forever sick ill make
him sick and he reached again for
the prisoner

  calm yourself calm yourself said
derr holding the prisoner behind him
youre a lile excited thats all youll
feel better after a while

  bills right agreed the agent
you listen to me no violence ab-
solutely not you know what the law
says about every man being supposed in-
nocent till hes proved guilty for all
you know this feller may be innocent
as the babe unborn shall a mans con-
stitutional rights be taken from him
by gawd no you go slow tom you
go very slow t shall hold you person-


peoples story magazine

ally answerable for any injury suffered
by this person

  if theres anything left after  get
through with you derr struck in softly

  say what is this demanded the
marshal stunned and bewildered by the
flare of oratory this aint the fourth
of july why for all the speeches i
didnt steal the chickens all this fuss
and feathers over a common prisoner
anybody would think he was your
brother charlie

  every man said charlie throwing
a chest is my brother i believe in
the golden rule do unto others-you
know

  and do em first paraphrased the
marshal yes i know i also know
you charlie when you go round
swelled up like a poisoned pup shouting
youre every mans brother and stand-
ing up with bill here for a prisoner
which ought to have the pants kicked
off him theres some skulduggery t
aint a complete fool

  youre mistaken said the agent
fending off the marshal with both hands
you are a complete fool especially
when you try to see more than an inch
beyond your nose theres that agency
warehouse contract your brother and
you want id certainly be sorry if any-
thing should come up to keep you from
getting it i would indeed and youd
be sorrier i expect

  well grumbled the marshal sulk-
ily giving ground you neednt think
you can bribe me he added

  certainly not denied the agent his
tongue in his cheek i wouldnt think
of such a thing i just happened to
mention the contract in passing of
course the kind of treatment you ac-
cord the prisoner will be prompted by
your own soft and generous heart
now that we understand each other lets
take the prisoner over to judge windus
and settle the thing quick here comes
a crowd

  so hastily the four of them bustled

round the corral skipped in between
two stables and doubled back past an-
other corral while the crowd led by
the marshals wife was searching one of
the two stables the four arrived unpur-
sued at the house of judge windus

  the latter was eating his breakfast
there was a wet towel wrapped turban-
wise round his head and the meal con-
sisted solely of coffee the session of
the night before must have been warm
and spirituous

  come in invited judge windus
regarding them with a bilious eye
dont stand blocking the doorway
come in and shut the door gawd
amighty no need to slam the thing
i got a headache and what do you
want charlie the other dime whos
this behind you what did you bring
him here for tom i told you i
wouldnt sentence him till this after-
noon

  quite right said the agent taking
it upon himself to reply its after-
noon now

  i meant this afternoon at the
courthouse rowed the judge sloshing
the coffee round in his cup what did
you bring him here for tom i asked
you 

  tom brought him here at my sug-
gestion inserted the agent focusing
the full power of his best smile on the
judge i thought it would save trou-
ble why go to all the bother of con-
vening court in the courthouse when
you can settle the job at home you
see my point yes as i was saving
the prisoner-

  what in so-and-so and such-and-
such have you got to do with the pris-
oner the amazed judge demanded
and why are you so anxious to save
me trouble

  i am sorry for this poor misguided
boy explained the agent with a
tremolo in his voice and an outflung
hand toward the prisoner my heart
bleeds for one in his situation
the wagon wheel



  well dont cry about it remarked
the judge at least not here whats
the prisoner to ou

  nothing absolutely nothing he
is simply a fellow man in distress i
intend to help him if i may to relieve
the unfortunate to succor the helpless
has ever been my aim in life

  with the accent on the sucker the
judge said brutally i know you back-
ward and sidewise charlie old-timer
whats the lile game

  the long and short of it is that id
like you to fine the prisoner here and
now instead of waiting till later
why

  as a favor to me

  as a favor to you huh  why as a
favor to you

  again the broad and beaming display
of teeth a whim of mine if you will
perhaps an opportunity to perform in
a small way an act of kindness to the
poor and needy

  not so much of your poor and
needy complained the prisoner im
no beggar

  perhaps you have the money to pay
your fine suggested the judge

  nun-no was the faltering reply
i havent a nickel

  you hear charlie says he hasnt
a nickel ill have to make his sentence
twice as long

  what cried the prisoner

  dont you bark at me young fel-
ler  the judge admonished the prisoner
you heard what i said if i hear you
beef about it im likely to give it to
you twice as heavy again thats me
judge windus

  i was hoping youd make it a fine
only judge the agent spoke up swiftly
you and i have always been old
friends you arent bearing malice over
what happened last night are you 

  surely not denied the judge not
at all whats three hundred dollars to
me nothing absolutely nothing but
if i should make it a fine wholl pay it

  i will derr and the agent an-
nounced simultaneously

  there seems to be a difference of
opinion purred the judge his bad old
eye lightening very well not as a
favor to mr shale but because of my
own slight indisposition i will hold
court here marshal i appoint you
clerk pro tern pen and inks yonder
use that pad the court will come to
order prisoner have you counsel
no you havent counsel i will ap-
point arthur green as your attorney

  but green aint here protested the
marshal looking round in bewildered
fashion

  the judge made a gesture of annoy-
ance that crashed a tumbler to the floor
never mind write that i appointed
green counsel for the prisoner its
merely a matter of form merely a mat-
ter of form where is the plaintiff
skidmore appearing for the plaintiff
now dont start asking where skid-
more is tom prisoner at the bar you
are charged with petit larceny disor-
derly conduct and a breach of the peace
in that you did feloniously unlawfully
and designedly attempt to defraud the
crocker stage company in the sum of
sixteen dollars and eighty cents which
sura is the cost of one trip betweefi fare-
well and blossom that you did not
complete the trip is immaterial do you
plead guilty or not guilty you plead
guilty i said you plead guilty shut
up how dare you contradict the
court shut up or ill commit you
the prisoner pleads guilty accord-
ingly you are fined one hundred dollars
on the charge of petit larceny one hun-
dred dollars on the charge of disorderly
conduct and one hundred dollars on the
charge of breach of the peace three
hundred dollars is the total correct
me mr shale if i am wrong

  here the judge grinned toothfully
upon the indian agent shale looked
rather blue so did derr the latter


peoples story magazine

carried precisely seventy-eight dollars
and sixty cents in his leather poke
three hundred dollars was ridiculous
derr thought so and the agent said so

  it is huh snorted the bilious
judge wheres your milk of human
kindness now wheres your bleeding
heart et cetera wheres your sucker-
ing aim in life huh i dont know
what your game is charlie but it will
cost you three hundred bucks to sit in

  this is outrageous this is rank
robbery but charlie made these as-
sertions without any hope that they
would be heeded he knew he was
beaten

 gimme time to go borrow some
monev from tudge allison said derr
ill pay the fine

  you too purred judge windus
couldnt think of it bill not for a

of an opportunity to relieve the dis-
tressed and unfortunate far be it to
be able to go through life sowing good
deeds storing up as it were treasures
in heaven is as great a privilege as it
is an edifying spectacle three hundred
slivers charlie of the root of all evil

  you old robber exclaimed shale
and you call yourself a friend of
mine

  always charlie always perhaps
youd rather that  increase the amount

of the fine

  not necessarily shale said hastily
driving his hand into the inner pocket
of his vest i cave i want to apolo-
gize too id never believed you were
any great shakes of a business man
judge but i take it all back you are
youre a wonder a he-wonder with
pink stripes three hundred i think
you said ten thirty fifty seventy
eighty-

blessed minute far be it from me to
deprive our generous friend mr shale

is it good for a jailor to run a street car and shouldnt a sailor
keep out of the wet

the glamour and romance of be-
ing a street-car motorman was
suffering intense extinction in
the mind of william cutherton the
first thrills of feeling this jangling con-
traption move when he pulled a lever
had gone long since even the delight
of riding on a thing that didnt have to
be steered only lasted a short time after
he got out of the navy he had been
formerly a quartermaster in our sea
establishment and an inhuman officer of
the deck had let him stand most of his
watches at the wheel

  a month had elapsed and this occu-
pation that once loomed rosy in his
dream was now dull and monotonous
drudgery the navy that he had cursed
and sworn to have nothing more to do
with wasnt such a terrible place after
all he recalled his oath to eschew all
devices that needed steering but he was
actually wishing he was back on ship-
board even if he had to stand six-hour
watches at the wheel for one thing
one wasnt continually having nervous
prostration for fear of knocking over

a traffic cop neither did he have to get
out and get under if a fuse blew

  the root of williams troubles might
as well be gotten at quickly he had
never been the same since magda had
stretched his aorta by showing a de-
cided preference for marks that cox-
swain in the naval militia the pill
wouldnt have made him swell up and
burst emotionally if that naval militia
fulminant hadnt been in it of all
things  earth he couldnt digest the
naval militia was worst and then to
have a measly coxswain in such an am-
ateur outfit come along and garner the
preferences of the girl youve been try-
ing to work into a marriageable state
for weeks

  williams language when he thought
about these iniquities was the uttermost
in realism

  why didnt william quit his job and
reenlist he was going to get his bonus
for shipping over and would undoubt-
edly be rated a chief petty officer 
wouldnt he though would he hesi-
tate a hundredth part of a second under
js

peoples story magazine

normal circumstancesf wouldnt he
 dash into the first recruiting office and
 sign up without condition

   he would if it zvasnt for leaving that
 coxswain with a clcar field

   it happened that the route over which
he daily labored was the twenty-third
street crosstown line near madison
avenue on this thoroughfare is the
largest naval recruiting office in new
york william looked at it wistfully
every time he passed sometimes he had
to fight the impulse to chuck everything
and ship over

   but his desire to prevent any naval-
militia triumph prevailed and he contin-
used his unhappy task in the hope that
better things were to come of course
it was the uniform this sap wore that
intrigued magda-william had perspi-
cacity enough to see that after the first
few times she had treated him with
indifference he tried to counter by
telling her of his own naval experience
he would never forget her skepticism

   i never did like a liar she had said
fixing upon him a withering look
youre just jealous of mr marks who
really has the cutest suit-i sometimes
wish i was a man-i guess if you ever
had a uniform youd be wearing it up
here every night

  i willwear it-

   magda was horrified

  william cutherton she had ex-
claimed if you come around here in
any fake uniform ill have you arrested
for impersonating an offcer i know
you-youre a motorman-always ms
and always will be a slacker whats jeal-
ous of heroes

   then and there had begun their quar-
rel calling marks a hero was more
than william could stand the conclu-
sion of the set-to had left no doubt of
magdas meaning mr william cuther-
ton was to call there never again

  he had gone away seven thousand per
cent less inclined to continue his ca-

reer as a motorman but some instinct
tade him hang on he did though the
task was infinitely more hateful becaust
the drudgery was garnished with per-
petual thoughts about his troubles

  one night after another almost in-
terminable day in transit william wat
on bis way to his boarding house in the
outskirts of brooklyn there was a
heavy downpour of rain and even
though he sought overspreading trees
and dodged from shelter to shelter lie
was wet through there was a shorter
route home than the one he vas tak-
ing he knew why he didnt take the
other even in a hurricane he would
have followed this one that led past
magdas house

  a fine- fool i ai he muttered she
wont have nothin to do with me and
still id get soakin wet jest to pass her
house think in  might get a look at her

  he cared nothing about the little
stream of water that trickled from the
peak of his cap down his face his
hopes were high that he might get a
fleeting glimpse of magda through a
window he shuddered as he contem-
plated the possibility of seeing her in
the arms of marks in such an event
it was fairly certain he would continue
right on to the ocean and dive in

  he walked on the rain gave no
sign of letting up it was dark almost
black suddenly a figure came into
view that of a man walking ahead of
him he peered at it making out the
dim outlines of an umbrella as it came
closer further scrutiny and he saw
the familiar outline of a pair of sail-
ors trousers

  william spoke before he thought an
old instinct prompting him

  hey sailor he called

  the man ahead paused and turned
about

  you know youre outa uniform with
that umbrella guess you ain t been in
the navy long eh
out of uniform



  huh grunted the fellow what
dye mean outa uniform

  youll go down fer a chute if any-
body sees ye said william he was
close to tlie man now-it was marks

  marks on his way to see magda
william looked him over uniform and
all and had a heroic struggle to over-
come an impulse to let him have a hand-
ful of fist it was such a nice lonely
spot

  marks scowled at him recognition all
too apparent in his face but he slowly
lowered the umbrella and walked away
leaving william in the throes of un-
mitigated self-reproach

  damn fool me lie growled
whyenell didnt i look fore i leaped
doin that sap a favor if id only rec-
ognized him id a said nothin and
mebbe hed a got into a jam but i
hadda go an teach him somethin good
night

  not only was he drenched through
but he was the picture of despair when
he arrived at his room half an hour
later fredson his roommate and a
fellow motorman greeted him cordially
but it had no effect

  whadye do fall n the river asked
fredson surveying the dripping wil-
liam

  naw grunted william taciturnly

  fredson picked up a paper

  dye see what happened to jones
poor guy he got five years fer man-
slaughter to-day

  william showed the faintest gleam of
interest at this

  motormen had been interested in the
trial of jones who had collided with
an automobile resulting in the death of
the driver

  poor devil echoed william and
then they say bein a motorman aint a
hazardous occupation say one day
were workin fourteen hours fer
practically nothin and the next
were goin to jail fer somethin we

couldnt help and ye git no pay for
for time ye serve either its a hell of
a world that fella jones is a martyr
yes sir a martyr by hickey an
the worst part of it is the same thing
is likely to happen to one of us anv
day

  fredson agreed in awed tones they
discussed the shortcomings of the mo-
torinans profession plainly the thing
they dreaded most was that almost in-
evitable day when they would hit some-
thing

  sure said fredson even if you
should be lucky enough not to hurt any-
bod yed be fired an all because
some damn fool thinks car tracks is put
there fer aesthetic purposes

  up in the back room of a gin mill in
the san juan hill district mr marks
was feeling vengeful it had all hap-
pened because he had let cutherton
make a fool out of him it had been
a ruse he was sure with himself as
the unsuspecting victim if only he
hadnt put that umbrella down none of
those exceedingly unhappy events would
have followed

  the thoughts mr marks was indulg-
ing were unpoetic in the extreme he
wanted gore and wanted it to spurt
with prolonged and reechoing gurgles
from the carcass of one w cutherton
he did not regret his failure to wallop
cutherton the night before mr marks
was not of a disposition to fight man to
man in that locality where he had been
raised it was the system to knife them
in tlie back or attack in gangs that
admitted of the maximum amount of
safety to ones self a condition that
marks enthusiastically preferred

  but for the purposes of constructive
revenge mr marka had gathered about
him half a dozeu more or less young
men who were famous for their utter
lack of scruples there were three bur-
glars a highwayman and two pickpock-
ets thev listened with interest to mr


peoples story magazine

marks the reason being they had just
been blithely healed and there had been
specious promises of more when the job
was done

  now said mr marks this boid
cutherton is a mot orman on the twen-
ty-third street line see ive investi-
gated and loined that hell rive at the
east side end o the line about one-thoity
to-morra afternoon s all very simple
gents all ye gotta do is be  hand and
help me beat im up

  there was one dissenting voice that
of a burglar

  phew he exclaimed in inspired
contempt ye need six men to beat
up one poor guy ye kin count me
out

 gimme back my money then
whined marks

  ha-ha-ha laughed the burglar i
must say you are funny even if you
are yella the idear o you askin me
for that money back when you know
how sudden you might git bumped off
if you got to insistin too hard ha-
ha-ha

  mr marks leaped lightly from the
subject and addressed the others they
however were agreed in the project
certainly it was an easy way to pick up
a little extra money marks having stip-
ulated that he only wanted cutherton
beat up

  try an stick a coupla black eyes
on him instructed marks ye see
i wanta tell this goil j beat him up
alone see an i want him to look the
part git me 

  they got him and promised to be
there one raised the question of how
much more tliey were to get marks
was prodigal in his promises

  it was noontime in the great open
spaces of the twenty-third street line
a street car slowly wended its weary
way eastward its driver one cutherton
being wearier he had negotiated
broadway after a series of exaspera-

tions and had stopped at madison ave-
nue passengers got aboard

  it would be well now to take one last
hopeless look at cutherton who was on
his way to doom in the form of one
finished and painstaking beating a few
blocks distant five journeymen gang-
sters entirely capable of their task
awaited cutherton judging by the way
he argued with passengers and growled
to himself was blissfully unaware of
this awaiting business he was due for
surprises in bunches

  that scowl with which he regarded
the world was soon going to undergo
impressionistic treatment-and color-
ing

  two bells sounded and he yanked his
levers it would seem that he wanted
to hurry to his fate the fact was he
was two minutes behind his schedule
and he was anxious to make it up he
would have sped the block between mad-
ison and fourth avenues if he could
have not even would he have looked
up at the recruiting station the flag of
which beckoned over the sidewalk he
had forgotten for once the mockery
in the legend

  men wanted for the navy see the
world and learn a trade

  another sign was occupying his at-
tention it read i guldenstein
meats and was emblazoned on the
rear of a delivery wagon that was pro-
ceeding tranquilly along the tracks
ahead the beast that drew it and the
one that drove it were magnificently
unheeding of the bell which cutherton
was clanging constantly it was a good
way to give vent to anger so cuther-
ton clanged more and louder the
wagon made no move to get out of the
tracks

  finally the motorman could control
himself no longer opening his front
window and leaning out he yelled

  hey you blankety blank by the
holy jumped up git outa my
way
out of uniform



  this language evidently functioned
for slowly the wagon began to swerve
to one side cutherton was desperate
again he yanked those levers giving all
possible speed to the car he was sure
there would be at least three inches of
room for him to pass-ample in the
estimation of a motorman he let her
go

  crash creak thud 

  he looked down and saw the left rear
wheel of mr guldensteins propertv
crumple and the wagon settle on the
hub a wreck he slammed on the air
bringing the car to a stop with such sud-
denness that he nearly went through the
front window

  this was really too much he looked
back to see if he had unhorsed any pas-
sengers he hadnt much to his re-
gret the driver of the wagon had
jumped down from the seat and was
yelling all manner of remonstrance
anathema invective and what not

  cutherton was surveying the damage
a crowd was gathering on the sidewalk
he looked out over it wondering what
next to do when that recruiting flag
waved into his line of vision it was
like a red rag to a bull the course
of action became clear as crystal

  william cutherton erstwhile motor-
man then and there calmly removed his
cap and meticulously placed it on a seat
off came his uniform coat next and this
he folded tenderly and placed beside the
cap from an inside pocket he calmly
took some papers glanced at them as
though to reassure himself and then
stepped down to the pavement he
walked to the sidewalk and up the stairs
to the recruiting office

  would they enlist him

   the officer in charge looked at his pa-
pers well rather-and theyd make
him a chief quartermaster

  ye havent got a extra suit i kin
put on around here have ye  asked
bill of the yeoman who made out his
reenlistment papers

  sure said the yeoman oh say
and where do ye prefer duty

  anywhere replied william

  the yeoman made the entry on his
record

  it took a great deal of maneuvering
on magdas part to finally accomplish
the meeting with cutherton she per-
sisted in spite of his letter his telephone
message and his telegrams to the effect
that he was off women for life she
waited at the navy-yard gate one night
and met him as he was coming ashore
on liberty

  honest william im sorry she
pleaded

  william was obdurate

  that dont make no difference if
i married you yoube callin me a liar
fore our honeymoon was over

  william her eyes were glowing
in admiration

  bill felt a thrill as he looked at her-
prettier than ever she was bewitching
an whatye gonna do when they come
that way he reasoned

  william do you really think i could
call anybody what wore such lovely
clothes a liar william do you

  er-well-ah-mebbe not said
william and now he simply had to
cave in he did so with abandon he
didnt care if she called him fifty liars
they were seated over bowls of chop
suey when lie finally mustered brash-
ness enough to inquire

  what happened to your friend
marks

  hmph never mention that boobs
name to me agin she snapped

  whatd he do asked bill in sur-
prise

  do he aint no genlman-no
manners a-tall came up to see me
soakin wet and nearly ruined our new
tapestry divan my mother is layin
for him with a rollin pin besides his
old umbrella dripped all over the carpet
he better stay away from our house

beano was modest too modest but sometimes excessive virtue has a
kick in it

it dont do to push a man too far
even though he aint very for-
ward remarked big jim there
was that modest young feller beano
wilson he was so bashful hed step on
his own feet and then apologize

 what a queer name i said
beano it sounds like a fruit my
observation was permitted to go un-
molested i put my feet up on the
worn railing of the little porch and
scanned the dusty road in search of
movement i saw a yellow butterfly
shining in the texas sun alighting now
and then on the unmoving unprotesting
flank of a prostrate hound dog

  modesty is the best policy some-
times i said trying to start the con-
versation again i preferred that the
talking be on big jims side he
seemed to be of the same inclination

  big jim stretched in the rocker and
almost fell over backward the start
awoke him and he relighted his ever-
lasting pipe i closed my eyes but the
yellow glare was still there

  now i was always a modest young
man when i was young as well as a
brave one said big jim reflectively
going back twenty or thirty years
and i find that when the modest ones
get goin theyre hard to stop push a
timid steer too far and hell horn you
every time young beano was like that
ony it looked like hed never get
started hed turn every time but he
alius went the wrong way hed run
away rather than fight too bashful
to raise a rumpus

  he who fights and runs away lives
to fight another day i quoted

  yeh said big jim as if agreeing
with an original remark but if you
keep runnin away you dont live to
fight another day you ony live to beat
it

  true  said too true but

about beano 

  beano come to town when he was
twenty or so i was bout thirty-five
then beano wasnt very big bout five
feet eight or so and not heavy his
when the worm turns



hair was yaller and he had a nice laugh
but he was alius blushin when there
was any gals around and he wouldnt
put either foot forward when it was
his turn hed work on a rauge and
never have one fight it was amazin
what hed take he was the town laugh-
instock he was and he didnt seem to
ever get mad the gals they liked him
but he was too bashful to talk to em
ive seen him standon one foot and then
the other for an hour yessin and noin
and bowin to a lady what talked like
a coffee mill all the time

  there was one gal he seemed to fa-
vor for hed blush redder when she
spoke to him that for any of the others
and he would foller her around carryin
her bundles and slavin for her but i
didnt think he ever dared ask her for a
kiss or nothin

   beano i says one day whatre
you so bashful for round esther he
offen come up to sit on the porch with
me cause i never deviled him

   t dunno jim he says but when
she talks to me i just like to listen
seems as if its better than music just
bearin her

   yeh but you oughnt to be so
scared of everybody bov i tells him
she dont like it

  i know she dont jim shes alius
tryin to get me to be braver but
somehow i cant do it i dont get mad
ever

  well i see there wasnt no use wor-
ryin him so t shifted the talk to some-
thin else

  twenty years ago the town wasnt
what it is now there was ony a couple
of saloons and a few houses along here
no fords like now and no movies all
transportation by horse and all the
amusement was drinkin and cussin and
a little flirtin cause there was ten or
twelve gals in the town and a hundred
or so cowmen

  there was a bad lrn here in the
town too he was named jackson i

think but we called him the bully or
just bully for that was his specialty

  the bully was suspected of doin
some dirty work nighttimes but nobody
dared ask him about it not even the
sheriff caute the bully was dam quick
to answer back and his answers wasnt
too gentle if theyd have caught him
in the act of doin anything wrong they
could have shot him on sight but he
was too slippery and too good at cover-
in his tracks for them to get anything
on him

   over there in the saloon the bully
would cut up and when he got liquor in
him he was mean course beano was
meat for him

    beano you two-legged cross-eyed
son-of-a-steer-chaain walrus you come
over here and show us the latest steps
thats the way bullyd talk

    yessir beanod say and hed do
anything bullyd tell him to

   one night durin a windstorm a cou-
ple of thousand dollars worth of gold
disappeared it was for payin off the
men in three sections and although it
was pretty well watched the money was
stolen now most of us figured that
bully had somethin to do with it but
we couldnt say nothing cause we had
no evidence the company offered a
big reward

    beano i says tothe boy one day
heres your chance get the goods on
the bully and youll be famous enough
to never have to fight again

   he jumped a little at that like he
was scared of even the thought of it

    me he says i aint goin to fool
with him he was lookin sort of
downhearted and so i dropped it

    whats the trouble  i asks him

    nothin he says tryin to lie

   is it about esther i asks him

    yeh he says jim she says she
wont marry me until i show i aint
scared of bully he was almost cry-
in then

  how beano ever got to propose to
u

peoples story magazine

the gal i dont know he must have
taken about two years to get up his
nerve and two hours tryin to get out
the words to ask her  was surprised
i went inside after a while and went to
bed ieavin beano sintin alone i
couldnt go to sleep and as  was lyin
right near the window i could hear what
was goin on outside

  beano he sat there smokin for a
long time it was pretty late when he
got up and went down the steps and
then i heard the click of a gun and
a voice i knew was the bullys

   oh its you is it says bully

   yessir says beano right smart

   i thought it was that big fool of a
jim davis he thinks hes pretty good
at playin target but ill show him
the bully didnt bother me much cause
i could shoot and i was big

   hes asleep says beano

 then the bully comes closer to
beano and i had to listen right hard to
hear him

   remember says the bully if you
tell ill bore you full of daylight

   i wont i wont says beano

   beat it quick says bully

  that made me think pretty hard i
was half afraid beano was in on the
robbery the way the bully talked but
then i remembered how bashful and
backward and modest beano was and
i couldnt quite believe hed steal any-
way i knew the boy was honest

  well time run on and there was
a big holdup and again they suspected
the bully but again nobody could speak
the sheriff was gettin desperate the
county offered a big reward to the man
who caught the highwayman

  and every little while beano would
come flying out of the saloon runnin
away from the bully or hed do a
dance to the tune of the bullys guns

  i would have butt in but i was wi sh-
in for the time when beano would get
mad

  big jim paused he lit his pipe again
it seemed to never need refilling

  very interesting i remarked tak-
ing out a cigarette and trying to keep
myself from heat prostration in the
lighting of it it was very very hot
go on  found the energy to say

  then i at still and watched a car-
riage turn out to keep from running
over the yellow dog in the street

  big jim continued

  well one day it happened  was
sittin on the porch listenin to the bully
roarin at beano in the saloon esther
beanos gal she was sitting doin some
sewin on the porch right next to mine
and directly opposite to the saloon and
there was several women near by lis-
tenin too all on my side of the street
cause on the other side was nothin
but the saloon and a big high old fence
down to the corner

  then out comes beano from the sa-
loon backin up like a broncho keep-
in time to bullys guns

   back up jump you little yaller-
haired white-livered piece of sheep
says the bully complimentarylike and
beano backed up

   git up says the bully and beano
comes a little forward

  i said back up roars the bully
poor beano kept goin and i saw esther
was like to cry to see him treated so
the other women was laughin a little
watchin the fun cause they knew
beano wouldnt get hurt

  beano backed all the way acrost the
street and the bully he give him an
awful push up against the fence beano
he danced while the bully shot at his
feet

   oh dear dear says esther by
this time cryin he  hurt beano i
know he will

  i thought it was bout time to help
beano out and i started to get up but
then the bully turned away and says
 nough for to-day you poor little

runt
when the worm turns



   beano starts to slide along the fence
to get away keepin his face to the
bully and the gals and me suddenly
the bully decided hed show off to the
gals some more

    come back here he yells at beano
you come acrost the street and do
some turns for the ladies before you
got to get your oats beano didnt run
but kept right on backin along the
fence

  the bully run over to him come
on he says tryin to pull beano over

  wow  then started the fight
bully never thought beano would dare
to fight back and hed emptied his pis-
tols beano pulled his gun and i
thought he was goin to kill the bully
then and there

   put down that gun says bully
and do what i tell you he moves up
to the kid again beano pulled the trig-
ger but the lock ony snapped i guess
he didnt dare keep his gun loaded for
fear it would go off

  but then he threw the gun at the
bullys head and caught him in the eye
the bully rushed at him beano led
out with all his might and took bully
in the stomach but bully was pretty
husky and he clouted beano in the
nose and drew some blood beano
fought like a grizzly and never flinched
an instant esther was watchin him
with her eyes shinin cause he was
fightin so well

   sheriff yells beano come over
here this is the man who stole the
gold and whos been doin all the hold-
ups

  the sheriff runs over and i too
what says the sheriff how do you
know beano

    i seen him coinin out with the gold
when he stole it he told me hed kill
me if i told but i dont care he
punches the bully in the mouth again

    quit roars bully i surrender
and so beano got the reward all for
himself and the bully went to jail on
iobpeo

 beanos evidence and when he was com-
 mitted he confessed to the jobs
 esther was glad and beano and she was
 married soon after i was happy too
 big jim stopped again

    the worm turned  said

    no he didnt said big jim
 when beano fought with the bully
 he kept his face to us all the time and
 had to fight like a wild cat to do it
 and when he finished he backed along
 the fence to the corner and went home

 i saw him the next day

    beano i says youre a hero
 whatd you want to run away for aft-
 erward 

    i couldnt stay around all them
 gals says beano

   why not you aint bashful any
 more are you  i asks that was the
 best and bravest fight i seen in a long
 time

    jim says beano i wouldnt have
 done it if i could have got away but
 when the bully tried to make me dance
 around for the gals i couldnt do it

    what was the matter i asks
 what made you get brave so quick
 anyway 

    well to tell the truth jim says
 the boy the bully backed me up to the
 fence and when he give me a push i
 must have caught on a nail when he
 pulled me back i heard somethin rip i
 couldnt dance around in front of all
 them gals then i had to do somethin
 when he called me back i couldnt run
 away and so i fought off the bully
  and i wasnt scared of him or any one
 else when i felt him under me yellin
 for help

    beano i says youre the modest-
 est man i ever met just cause you
 tore your trousers leg you took a chance
 on gettin killed

     i thought it was that what tore too
 jim says beano but when i looked
 after i was out of sight i found it was
 ony my handkerchief which was stuck
 in my belt

chapter i

on the sky line of the ridge at
whose foot sprawled the shacks
of hades city a tall young man
in sober clothes was talking confiden-
tially to a rattlesnake

  you he was saying as his right
hand dropped back to where a pros-
pectors hammer dangled from his belt
appear to me to have a mighty ugly
disposition sonny see

  the big snake dropped its head an
inch or two and added to the warning
of its rattle the additional threat of a
long hiss the young mans fingers
closed on the handle of the hammer
drew the weapon forth and held it
quivering slightly ready for a throw

  therefore-- said peter martin

  hades city was a full mile away
down the slope but the evening air
was still and sound-especially such
sound as the inhabitants of hades liked
to produce-traveled far the crash
of glass which proceeded from the
heres how tea house as a miner
swept bottles and glasses off the bar
and the scream of laughter which went
up as having accomplished this hu-
morous feat the joker fell unconscious

on the floor came clearly to peters
ears and hearing it the young man
twisted the wrist which was about to
send the hammer thudding into the
snakes coils and instead hurled it
with a crash into the rubble on which
the serpent lay

  git you son of a gun martifl
roared as the rattler terrified streaked
away git to some other part of the
country i dont blame you for bein
mean stay around these parts an
youll get so vicious youll die of your
own poison

  picking up his hammer again and
seating himself on the pack he had
dropped when the snake had glided out
of the rocks to confront him the young
man rested his chin on a broad brown
fist and took a panoramic view of the
country visible from the ridge

  gosh what a dump he said

  as a matter of fact the landscape
was momentarily looking its best a
cloud of sunset-tinted steam from the
hauling machinery was veiling the hide-
ous red derricks of the henderson cop-
per mines the decrepit unpainted tower
and smokestack of the virgin shaft
were out of sight around a shoulder

of the ridge the reflection from the
scarlet sky and the violet horizon soft-
ened the barren rocky flats and mounds
of the district and in that pastel-tinted
light even hades city with its build-
ings made of signboards stolen from the
side of the railway track looked com-
paratively inoffensive

   but it was not to the physical aspects
of the locality that peter martin was
alluding in his week of prospecting
with hades city for headquarters he
had formed most unfavorable opinions
of the county-it had no water no for-
age no roads no trees and no animal
life except human beings and snakes
it was to the human beings that peter
particularly objected on the whole the
snakes had proved infinitely more tol-
erant of strangers and much less vi-
cious in their dealings with each other

   cleaner-lived by a darn sight too
the young man muttered rising and
picking up his pack down in the heres
how tea room the party with which
the town drunkard was celebrating his
weekly birthday was just getting into
its stride at one end of the oil-lit
room con meyer the tea rooms owner
was methodically kicking the limp body
of the smasher of his glasses toward the
door grinning as he imitated in his
bulls voice the screams of a painted
girl who was still sober enough to watch
him among the tables which dotted
the dance floor half a hundred couples
ninety per cent male and one hundred
per cent intoxicated stamped about
drowning the music of a disreputable
phonograph with their maudlin yells it
seemed to peter martin that the clean
clatter of pebbles under foot would be
preferable to his ears and so kicking
his feet as much as possible among the
rubble he started down the slope to-
ward the town

  he had advanced about fifty yards
when the almost simultaneous sounds
of a motor horn a revolver shot and
a womans scream cutting in sharply

  above the more distant medley of sound
from the heres how made him stop
dead for an instant then drop his pack
and run at top speed toward the nar-
row track which ran around the ridge
from the virgin mine to hades city

   from the time of the gold rushes on-
ward to the present the empire west
of the mississippi has seemed by some
strange automatic process to separate
itself into two perfectly distinct parts-
the desirable and the undesirable and
without statutes or police to segregate
the latter of these sections in forty-
nine there were hundreds of more-or-
less-permanent towns peopled entirely
by desperately hard-working men who
wore no guns and there were perhaps
six camps in which every man went
armed with the avenger of blood at his
heels

   when in later years the cattle of
the great ranges gave place to sheep
there was civil war in perhaps three
counties elsewhere not a shot was fired
and it is the same to-day as the oil
men and the miners are butting into
the sheepmans hard-won domain in
half a dozen towns the white lights
never go out death patrols the streets
by night and by day while in the rest
of the country millions of people of
whom one never hears continue to work
hard by day and sleep soundly and
safely at night there is something
about the open spaces which gives men
and women with the small weak crim-
inal soul an irresistible longing for the
companionship of their own kind

   on the last evening of peter martins
stay in hades city four gentlemen of
this stripe stimulated by each others
presence and much bad whisky had
actually gained courage to shamble be-
yond the city limits and to hold up with
their eight revolvers a battered tin motor
car containing a girl one shot had
been fired-the bullet had torn through
the radiator nd flattened itself against
the long-suffering engine-and as peter

martin hammer in hand passed a clump
of sagebrush ten yards from the halted
car the man who had tired stumbled
forward and with a howl of drunken
laughter stretched out his arms toward
the girl in the drivers seat

  he did not touch her however as
his uncertain foot gained the running
board the hammer which peter mar-
tin had refrained from throwing at the
rattlesnake took this more contemptible
animal in the small of the back and
dropped him bellowing and gasping
into the dust and the next instant a
list accustomed to swing that hammer
against unyielding quartz met the chin
of a second holdup man with a thud
knocking him head first over the hood
of the little car

   its tlie easterner mumbled one of
the two remaining plug him harry
go on plug-

  with the wisdom of his kind he
was trying to delegate the responsibility
of this urgently needed action but his
drink-shaken finger betrayed him and
as he backed away pushing his compan-
ion forward into the fray his right-hand
gun exploded and a bullet raised dust
at peters feet he realized his mis-
take at once and turning started to
run with a short laugh and a long
leap peter martin dropped his flying
hundred and sixty pounds of weight
on the fugitives shoulders at the same
instant swinging a terrible right up un-
der the ear nothing would have been
easier than for the fourth man to kill
him as he rose clear of this fallen foe 
but no shot was fired left alone al-
beit with two heavy revolvers against
an unarmed man the remaining bandit
had fled when peter brushing dust
from his eyes turned to end the com-
bat he was fifty yards down the track
running wildly toward the friendly
lights of the town

  the silence as peter stared after
him was suddenly broken by a silvery
laugh

    i hanks awfully for saving my life
and all that said a soft lazy voice
i rom the shadow of the roadsters top
but doesnt he run like a gander

  it appeared to peters exploring
tongue that a valuable canine tooth had
suffered during the fracas leading up
to this amusing conclusion he re-
moved it carefully with finger and
thumb and following an age-old habit
of humanity stored it in his waistcoat
pocket

     i dont believe he thensaid gravely
that i ever have seen a gander miss
theyre a kind of bird that floats arent

they

  yes said the voice from the car
with another ripple of laughter of
course they are

  well you see peter explained 
come from the colorado desert

  i thought you were from the east

  no said peter feeling a lip which
appeared to be split by a half-inch cut
they just call me that around here
because they claim im too refined
not caring for red i wear a khaki
shirt which kind of annoys them and
then again i wash and shave when
possible and dont swear when it can
be helped

  doubtless said the lazy voice with
a mocking thrill in it you are the
younger son of a british nobleman who
has grown tired of the trivialities of
the fashionable world do say you
are

  in the mockers opinion it was em-
barrassment which caused peter to
hesitate thirty seconds before replying
but on the contrary it was merely a
mouthful of blood shed in her defense
of which he wished to dispose with-
out shocking her having solved this
problem

  no he replied my dad was a
professor of metallurgy came out to
the colorado prospecting-and stayed

  why
the misfit man



  there wasnt enough money in be-
ing a professor

  there was a momentary pause
come here said the silvery voice
in rather a subdued tone

  peter moved slowly over to the side
of the roadster a slim hand thrust
impulsively from the shadow fell on
his arm

  ive just realized said the voice
that im a beast to joke with you when
youve just saved me- youll for-
give me wont you its the thing
back east to pretend that everythings

funny and- why your lips cut

   in an instant the roadsters door flew
open and the girl whom peter mar-
tin had not yet seen was standing on
the running board in the light of the
half-risen moon a perfectly useless lace
handkerchief raised halfway to the
bleeding mouth

    s all right protested peter in an
indistinct mumble very different from
his clear slow speech of a moment be-
fore i-er-ah-er-

  the words trailed off into silence
the girl made no motion for five sec-
onds that seemed like a year no sound
was to be heard on the trail save the
slow dripping of water from the punc-
tured radiator of the car though
neither peter nor the girl heard that
their hearts had suddenly started to
thunder in an inexplicable manner which
each feared must be perfectly audible
to the other

  im-awfully sorry- said the

girl in a strange breathless voice

  peter reassured her

  that he said in the measured la-
borious manner of one who emerges
from an anaesthetic is quite all right
not at all i-er-i mean i can get
that fixed in town in just a minute

  if you could come up to the house
the girl said theres peroxide and all
that sort of thing and i know the colo-
nel would want to thank you-i haven t
introduced myself but im virginia

way and im staying with colonel
lockhart who owns the virgin mine
you know he was a sort of uncle of
my fathers

  im sorry said peter but im
leaving town to-night-in fact in about
a quarter of an hour-and if i miss
this train i cant go for two days they
only run a train on monday and thurs-
day my names peter martin im
a prospector havent struck anything
here so im going somewhere else

  the conversation had a certain in-
coherent quality which peter disliked
yet which he could not remedy nor
try as he would could he keep his eyes
away for more than ten seconds at a
time from those of the girl the young
man was not sufficiently unsophisticated
to be ignorant of what ailed him but
it was his first experience of the tender
emotion and his early training had not
equipped him with the smiling mask
which virginia wore as she looked at
him he felt that his eyes were abso-
lutely giving him away-in which he
was quite correct what he did not
know was that the girl was praying for
a miracle that would remove the care-
fully trained mockery from her eyes
and let them give her away too

  so that he felt extremely miserable

  well good-by he said blushing
violently

  must-must you go

  peter searched his mind for some-
thing to say but it was given over in
spite of himself to whirling fantasies

  yes he brought out with difficulty

  similarly and with the same result
the girl on the running hoard ran over
her vocabulary for the right phrase

  im sorry she said at last

  there was a long pause

  well-good-by said peter when
the silence had become unendurable

  good-by

  suddenly she had an inspiration

  wont you start the car for me
she asked the man shot it and-
 

  peter twisted the crank and with the
lack of tact for which cheap automo-
biles are famous the wounded roadster
broke at once into cheerful explosions
it was willing to go anywhere and do
anything there was not the slight-
est need for any stranger to offer any
further assistance

  well-good-by

  goodhby

  and so without a handshake the two
parted and as peter totally oblivious
of the pack he had dropped on the hill-
side walked rapidly toward lades city
he heard the roadster with an increased
fusillade of explosions and an agonized
whine of low gear start around the
turn of the track which led to the home
of colonel lockhart

  he was still walking rapidly quite
unconscious of his surroundings when
the voice of con meyer boomed in
his ears- waking with a start he real-
ized that he was opposite the heres
how tea room which lay on the way
to the railroad track con meyers
bulky silhouette filled the orange-lighted
oblong of the door and at various win-
dows appeared the shadows of other
men crowding to look out into the
heavy dusk

  hey you-dude easterner yella-
belly martin or whatever you call
yourself roared the drink seller

  peter walked over to within two
yards of him

  yes he asked mildly

  it is difficult to say just what con
meyer would have done had he been
able to gauge the power of the emo-
tions which were boiling within the man
he addressed probably he would have
gone ahead with his project for though
a bully he was not a coward but he
would have gone ahead much more
carefully when tormenting a man who
has just fallen in love for the first and
only time has given the girl up as in-
accessible and has started away never
to see her again-it is wiser to use any

hand that one may have at liberty for
the hoisting of a lethal weapon to some
convenient position rather than for the
shifting of a cigar from the left side
of ones mouth to the right con
meyer however did not know and so
he merely moved the cigar

   w e-e-u he said and so heres
the squire of dames all dressed up in
his gentlemanly clothes going  take
a pullman drawing-room back to his
luxurious home in the effete east

  he chewed the cigar butt while his
satellites within the tea room paid him
the tribute of laughter

  yeah he said when the snigger had
ceased youre the right ope to rescue
her all right she says oh awflyf
and then you say what-ho old bean
and you have a lovely time together
peter covered another yard of the
distance separating him from the big
man

  shut up he said

  ew rahly ole chap doncherknow
said meyer shawly yah aint gewin
to it me are yer ew dont it me
what would the poor gal do if you was
brought around all shot full of holes

doncherknow thatd be awflv-

  he did not finish because at that
exact moment the cigar in the right
corner of his mouth was driven clear
back into his gullet by the impact of
peter martins left fist which follow-
ing the red-hot tip and spattering it
over the big mans face completed its
swing against meyers teeth and
knocked him sprawling backward into
a knot of his friends and then his
face was trampled on by a hobnailed
boot as the prospector climbed over his
body iot two punches at those friends
they fell heavily on their leader groan-
ing a revolver shot blotted out one of
the hanging lamps somebody on the
dance floor threw a chair then peter
martin turned from the minority to the
majority and the fight was on

  had any one in the hall been even
the misfit man



comparatively sober of course he
would have been shot to death before
he could take more than one step for-
ward  but on the other hand had they
been sober the men present would
scarcely have cared to side with con
meyer against the quiet stranger whose
length of limb breadth of shoulder and
firmness of jaw had been widely noted
during the week of his stay in hades
even though far far above themselves
those present had been painfully im-
pressed by the narrative of the holdup
man who had escaped from the battle
near the roadster it had taken the
combined efforts of con meyer and of
bully blake the night superintendent
of the henderson mine to assure the
gang that peter was a false alarm

  and by the irony of fate it was upon
blake next after meyer that peter laid
his hands leaping at the big mans
throat chancing the explosion of a re-
volver whose muzzle touched his ribs
peter bent him backward suddenly-
slipped an arm under his back lifted
him and with a sidewise heave jammed
the bullys head and shoulders through
a window where he left him caught in
the frame and bellowing like a calf
and he left him only just in time bully-
had no friends but many supporters
and four of these choice spirits were
advancing on peter as he turned

  put em- began one threaten-
ingly-and then ceased suddenly as his
mouth nose and solar plexus came
simultaneously into contact with the
board floor his revolver exploding as
he fell for with a lightning duck and
leap forward peter had hurled himself
like a projectile against the mans
knees sweeping them from under him
and as the fallen leader writhed in an
agony of breathlessness two of his com-
panions punched in the back of the
neck by the quiet stranger who a mo-
ment ago had been in front of them
fell unreservedly across each other

  dont shoot howled a muffled

voice from the window frame you
dern fools dont shool you might
hit me 

   it was the voice of bully blake only
too conscious of his chance of catching
a stray bullet and for an instant the
fourth man of the quartet who had
come to his rescue hesitated over the
pulling of his trigger in that instant
he felt peter martins left hand seize
the revolver while the corresponding
right hand struck him a dazing smash
on the cheek bone he dropped to his
knees rolled over on his side and lay
there peacefully thinking how much his
present sensations resembled his feel-
ings when kicked by a mule

  now wait a minute he heard the
voice of peter saying from six feet
above him wait a minute before we
go any further im standing here with
a gun in my hand and i think some-
bodys going to get seriously hurt if
you men want me to treat you like bi-
peds youd better let the ladies get out
of the room before we start

  one of the girls at the far end of
the hall made a panicky advance to-
ward the door but a vast hand from
the crowd seized her arm and held her

  i dont know said a hoarse but
sobered voice from somewhere in the
rear that this is any quarrel of oum
is it boys

  there was a rumble of negation

   i dont wanna get shot shrilled the
girl trying to tear herself loose

  nor do we growled the giant who
was holding her

  there was a general chuckle the
corners of peter martins mouth
twitched

  then glancing at the clock which
hung over the counter he pushed his
hair out of his eyes pulled himself to-
gether and walked slowly over to the
door there he turned and again faced
down the room as he noted with a
grim satisfaction it now had a far-
from-festive appearance close at

hand con meyer and his friends had
risen very much the worse for wear
and were standing by the counter feel-
ing their various wounds near the
window graced by the torso of bully
blake who was dismally howling for
help four more men were still pros-
trate all the little table about the
dance floor were overturned either by
peters first charge or to serve as bar-
ricades and in the back of the pic-
ture made still more miserable by the
patchy light of the one remaining lamp
crouched the whole sporting popula-
tion of hades looking very far from
sportive

  peter wagged the revolver at them
and cleared his throat

  before i catch the train he said
jerkily i should like to get something
off my chest it is my opinion of you
and its too darn unpleasant to keep
inside me any longer first of all
then youre the scum of the earth sec-
ondly youre a miserable bunch of cow-
ards and thirdly considering these
first two qualities youre a blot on the
face of the west i dunno what you
came out here for any of you the
bowen and the barbarv coast and the
third ward and carmine street are
the places for the like of you i-im
not talking to you ladies

  the girl who had tried to escape at
the beginning of the fight suddenly
burst into tears peter bit his lip

  got any thing else to say asked
con meyer mockingly

  peter turned and looked him full in
the face

  yes i have he said im just
going to tell you this meyer ive
been prospecting over this location and
ive seen a few things ive noticed
how the henderson mine has been try-
ing to hog all the land around there
by having dummies take up claims ive
seen your name on half a dozen stakes
for instance

  meyer flushed darkly

 why you-

  shut up thats the laws business
-not mine heres what im going to
tell you-all of you i guess youre all
tarred with the same brush all hen-
derson thugs  guess you know as
well as  do that the virgin mines got
the head of the lode-old colonel lock-
harts mine and i guess you know
why he hasnt been able to raise cap-
ital enough to worjf the mine or even
keep full shifts going hendersons
prevented it and i guess you know
why henderson aims to get that
mine for an old song and  guess youre
going to help him

  con meyers voice was thick with
rage

  if we know all this then he
snarled whatre you tellin it to us
for huh

  just to inform you said peter
slowly that i know it too and to
remark that the day things start to hap-
pen at the virgin mine   come back
and talk to you again

  there was a general chuckle through
the room one man might be able to
clean up the assembled ruffians but for
one man to threaten the henderson
mining corporation was really absurd

  but coii meyer was too angry to
laugh he stepped forward and shook
a bleeding finger in peters face

  you-you d-d easterner he

cried you come here an tell us re

aint fit for the west you-

  peter smiled

  well if you are  he said im not
ive had this easterner thing thrown at
me co often by alleged westerners of
your stamp that i almost hope there s
something in it anyhow i m going
to give it a chance im sick of this
kind of dump anyhow so im goin

east to-night

  he surveyed con meyers face
but-in that matter of the virgin
mine-remember there are train
back
the misfit man



  for some reason this added the last
straw to meyers burden of fury

  you poor fool he almost shrieked
his face distorted with a wolflike grin
youre doin all this threatenin be-
cause a girls bin makin soft eyes at
you you wont let her pore ole grand-
fathers cousin that shes so fond of
lose his mine wont you

  you shut up said peter making
half a step forward and clenching his
fist shut up meyer

  you fool went on meyer do you
know who the girl is that youre startin
all this on account of do you know
what she is this girl that lets on to love
her pore ole civil war veteran of a
great-uncle so much

  he paused and his beady eyes glit-
tered

  why he shouted mockingly at last
shes john p hendersons ward

chapter ii

  that section of the west-as might
have been deduced from the number of
undesirable strangers infesting it-was
passing through one of the transition
periods common to all rich and newly
settled countries the hades city dis-
trict-a storehouse of nonprecious ore
-had been opened up by the individual
prospector and for a time worked by
the private companies he formed now
the eye of wall street had fallen on
the land john p henderson had
bought rechristened and refurnished
with machinery the old maria mine
and suddenly the whole character of
life in the district had changed

  previously each of the owners of the
half dozen decrepit mines dotted about
hades had emerged from each years
operation with a profit which while
not as large as efficient methods could
have made it was amply sufficient for
his needs preferential freight rates
floating finances and similar modern
devices designed to give one man a

maximum profit at the expense of oth-
ers were unknown-until john p hen-
derson arrived on the scene and as
innovations they had not been popular

  the remaining individualist mine
owners most of whom had located their
own lodes joined forces and fought
the henderson mining company for six
months very much as half a dozen
naked indians might in their ignorance
of modern improvements band together
to fight a machine gun or six inexpe-
rienced pebbles form an alliance to stop
a steam roller there had been armed
warfare in which mine hands armed
with natures weapons had been met by
hendersons hired mine guards carry-
ing riot guns there had been appeals to
railroad boards of directors and to gov-
ernment commissions during which the
henderson array of counsel had made
hay of their opponents contentions
there had been conferences both in
hades city and in new york at which
the ex-prospectors had argued pleaded
and stormed while john p henderson
smiled reiterated his offer to purchase
their properties at his figure and of-
fered the alternative of bankruptcy

  at the end of six months he had
gained every mine in the district save
one too late the individualists had
tried to adopt corporation tactics and a
commercial code of morals had gone
behind their agreement and tried to
sell out independently for a better price
with bland promises not to disclose the
treachery henderson had bought out
one after another and placed his own
men on the subsidiary claims surround-
ing the property of each he owned
everything in the district-except the
virgin mine

  alone among traitors colonel lock-
hart had refused to deal in treachery
when the rest retreated to palm beach
with modest fortunes and uneasy con-
sciences colonel joe remained in the
unpainted frame house on v irgin hill
and gazed at the prospect of bank-

ruptcy as a man may who has nothing
wherewith to reproach himself

  the country about him seethed with
plot and counterplot but a wound
gained at bull run kept the colonel
from associating with the country
save for the aged colored servant who
had accompanied the young master
west from kentucky befo de wah
and lately virginia way the old gen-
tleman was as much alone as he had
been when he discovered hades flats
with their population of indians and
bison

  i do not blame your guardian rt-
ginia he had said gently when the
girl had once spoken of the situation
i estimate his actions to be along the
lines so to speak of moden progress
to which we must all bow-if possible
i regret viginia that to me it is not
possible i do not expect him to blame
me for my upbringing and i therefore
cannot find fault with his no in
fact my main feeling is one of grati-
tude to him for bringing you down to
hades city with him by so doing i
consideh he has largely repaired the
injury done me by youah respected fa-
theh in selecting him as a guardian for
you ratheh tlian mysef

  you see daddy thought-

  and quite rightly the colonel had
interposed it was not fitting for a
representative lady of the ways to hide
her light from the more appreciative
eyes of the east quite hm my
personal feelings make me regret but
 the abstract question i am quite at
one with youah fafheh wginia
quite

  it looks so strange the girl had
said for me to be visiting a relative
as if i were going from one hostile
camp to another i should think youd
suspect my good faith f

  such a suspicion might occur to mr
henderson hie colonel corrected
gravely not to me and now
might i ask you permission to point

out the remakable effect of the sunset
on the derrick hrad paint would
doubtless preserve it better but the lack
of paint has its advantages dont you
think  a poetic pusson might almost
trace a similarity between that struc-
ture and a spidehs web hai

  at seventy-three a man can be re-
signed and trustful much more easily
than at twenty-four while in hades
city the aged and crippled colonel un-
able to reproach himself with any
breach of his personal code therefore
smiled at approaching ruin and the sug-
gestion of further treachery peter
martin young and able-bodied tramped
about the streets of new york sick-
ened by the rapid diminution of his
saved funds and with con meyers last
words a continual sore spot in his con-
sciousness economically peter was in
the same boat with colonel joe for just
as surely as henderson had driven min-
ing competitors out of business by his
financial thimblerigging he had by-
means of his dummies taking up land
for him on all sorts of pretexts closed
the hades district to the independent
prospector

  it was the third tract in succession
which peter had found so preempted
and his journey east had been the prod-
uct of necessity the small legacy
which had come to him on the death of
his father was almost exhausted he
had conceived the idea since it was
useless to try to prospect against hen-
derson to get a job prospecting for
that company until he could amass an-
other grubstake sufficient to take him
farther on his own quest

  brought up by a father who had to-
tally lacked business ability-where the
legacy had come from was a perfect
mystery-peter had had no conception
of the methods by which great corpora-
tions achieved their results the side
light thrown on the business by con
meyers hint had appalled him the
more terribly because he had realized
the misfit man

in that instant that he was in love with
the girl who had lent herself to the
business

  of course he had had his moments
of failure to believe the accusation he
felt guiltily that if he had been a he-
man of the type which dominates fic-
tion he would never have doubted vir-
ginia at all but he was merely human
and what evidence there was pointed
in the other direction con meyer he
knew was in hendersons pay and con 
meyers bootleg saloon in fact an en-
terprise by which the thrifty magnate
recovered a large portion of the money
he was forced to pay his labor and his
bullies in con meyers saloon be-
fore the habitues had discovered that
he was not one of their stamp peter
had learned that the virgin mine con-
trolled the head of the lode and that
henderson was determined to get it
away from colonel joe by fair means
or foul

  and looking back on his one inter-
view with virginia with the distorted
vision which sometimes afflicts young
men who do not know where their next
meal will come from peter seemed to
see in the girls carefully careless man-
ner the indication of a heartlessness
which might let her lend herself to such
work

  passionately he had told himself that
he would put her out of his mind guilty
or not guilty until he had earned lei-
sure to investigate the matter more
thoroughly and further that the hen-
derson mining corporation should not
be the agency through which he earned
that leisure it added not a little to
his misery that he had not kept to the
first part of this resolve for even five
minutes after making it to the sec-
ond clause he had held desperately for
two months but now of all the min-
ing concerns whose offices crowded half
a dozen tall buildings on lower broad-
way the henderson corporation of-
fered the only opening



  there is honor among individual
thieves one poisonous snake cannot
poison another but the analogy does
not hold among corporations a dozen
concerns which in their time had
crushed the life out of hundreds of in-
dependent miners were now in the grip
of henderson they were frightened as
their victims had formerly been and
like their victims again they were mak-
ing pitiful efforts to hold out against
the power of hendersons millions by
discharging all they could spare of their
staffs

  on the other hand the henderson
corporation perhaps by way of a crow
of triumph over the international cop-
per federation which had just fallen
into its hands was advertising for a
dozen men to replace the deceased com-
panys representatives on the property

  peter heard of it at a sort of en-
gineers employment agency where
with five dollars for which he now
longed bitterly he had registered him-
self in telling him of the opening the
secretary who had been extremely op-
timistic before the deposit was paid
shook his head sadly

   youve no qualifications he mur-
mured examining a card on which he
had listed peters age height weight
color nationality parentage state of
health preferences as to location sal-
ary required education degrees refer-
ences previous employment and re-
ligion

  i know ore peter informed him
from the time of the incandescence of
the earth to the cupola

   no degree the secretary mourned

   i was taught peter informed him
tightening his belt over the aching void
which should have contained his break-
fast by the boss authority in the west
and i had ten years of his teaching
instead of four and ive been doing

retary rather cynically would serve

so in fact we-er-

  go ahead said peter grimly you
mean my clothes 

  the secretary nodded he was really
a nice young chap and his desire wa
to be helpful that the man he was
endeavoring to jielp glared at him may
be explained by the old proverb deal-
ing with the quality of the debate be-
tween a full man anil a fasting

  ive been told that before snapped
peter to get a job prospecting on a
burro or bossing a shift of square-
heads in a shaft  must come all
dressed up like a tea drinker its
funny you know back there in the
west they used to give me the rasp-
berry because i was so darn eastern
in my ways here they give me the
burro laugh because i look like a west-
erner on the train they tried to sell
me chicago-made icavajo blankets be-
cause they figured i came from new
york and here on the subway yester-
day a cop searched me for a gun be-
cause he thought id deserted from
buffalo bills show or something i
dont seem to fit anywhere

  the secretary coughed

  well peter inquired do i go
after this job or dont i

  he had entirely lost sight of his re-
solve to have nothing to do with hen-
derson but then his last meal had
been the day before yesterday and it
must be remarked that half as much
hunger has ere now caused many a man
to forget the whole ten command-
ments

  the secretary handed him aslip of
paper

  see henderson himself he ad-
vised and-good luck

  thanks said peter

  and ten minutes later he liad passed
a glass door heavily lettered in gold
and advanced to the mahogany railing

which separated the henderson min-
ing corporation from the rest of the

world

  card demanded an office boy
when he asked to see the president

   peter handed him the slip of paper

  oh that aid the youth con-
temptuously wait a minute

   ieter seated hinuelf on a mahogany
bench outside the rail the contemptu-
ous office boy a large consignment of
gum tucked up under his left cheek
ixme returned to the desk from which
lie had risen and added the rattle of
his typewriter to that of half a hun-
dred other machines which filled the
outer office for half an hour the ap-
plicant for a job studied tlie frescoed
ceiling the rich furniture and the backs
of the necks of the smartly dressed
stenographers-they were thriftily
seated so that they could not waste time
looking up when any one came in at
the office door at the end of that
period he walked over to the railing
and addressed die office boy

  how much longer

   i dunno the youth returned with-
out looking up from his keyboard he
had had an excellent breakfast himself
and had the money in his pocket for
a satisfactory lunch he was more-
over busy drawing a platoon of sol-
diers composed entirely of small and
capital os carets and percentage
marks hungry men looking for work
were nothing in his young life

   you go tell the president im wait-
ing said the man at the railing in a
strange new tone

   the office boy looked up

  say you- he began and

jlien his eyes meeting peters he
stopped nay more he rose slowly
and as it were automatically from his
comfortable seat

   ive tried to be nice and polite and
eastern said peter now i m hungry
git

  w-w-what name please asked the
the misfit man

b

office boy he looked at peter an in-
stant longer and added sir which
though practically inaudible was a
striking tribute to the force of a hun-
ger-strengthened personality the
youth was accustomed to call his father
kiddo and had left no less than four
offices consecutively because the man-
agers of departments objected to his
calling them by their christian names

  you tell mr henderson that peter
martins here peter martin of hades
city and that the business is urgent
hop it

  and in two minutes from that word
peter confronted the great john hen-
derson

  good morning he said as he en-
tered a private office whose entire
northern end was a window the glare
of light in his eyes made it difficult to
see the face of the man who sat with
his back to the window which was ex-
actly what henderson desired he said
himself that he used that office mainly
as a place in which to play poker-
with mines for cards and millions for
the chips in the game and he could
not even play poker fairly he wanted
to see his adversaries faces without
letting them see his

  well he asked

  an instant later he gave a short
chuckle and leaned forward over the
glass top of his desk

  well mr peter martin of hades
city-and what can i do for you

  the slip from the employment
agency had been mislaid by the alarmed
office boy

  i want a job said peter succinctly
the light was hurting his eyes and mak-
ing him feel untidy unshaven shabby
-which again was just what john p
henderson wanted with all his visitors
i havent any degree from any univer-
sity  but i know ore and i can handle
men i understand this is a copper
proposition and i know copper

  oh you want a job engineering do
you  asked henderson

  yes

  there was a moments pause

  i had thought-from what i have
heard of you said the magnates voice
softly that youd probably be after
employment as a prize fighter or a thug
or something

  from what-youve heard of me
gasped peter

  yes drawled henderson from
my ward first and secondly from my
manager in hades city neither of
them seemed to know anything about
your mining abilities but both adver-
tised you as a first-class fighting ruffian
how many of my men did you savage
in one evening was it fourteen or
only ten

  peters eyes hardened his lips
compressed to a thin line twitched
slightly at the corners

  i think ten he replied coolly i
regret even more than you do that it
was not the larger number

  you do eh and you expect me
to give you a job huh

  the multimillionaire leaned across
the desk again and let his eyes travel
up peters shabby length from his dusty
boots to his frayed string tie

  you look like a tramp he said
slowly and happily and i guess
youre hungry too and id like you
to go on being hungry in that rig i
guess itll be some time before youll
find anything much to do in this town
i should imagine said peter that
a man of your type could have a sim-
ple little wish like that this is a small
game compared with your usual and
i guess as always youve got the cards
stacked you should be able to win
against me

  the trouble said henderson is
just that ive only got to tell you to
get to blazes out of here and i think
youd be a good deal hungrier than you
are now before you got together your


peoples story magazine

car fare back west and id like to
see you hungry you lout id like to
see you standing outside bakeshops
sniffing the breeze you think its
funny dont you small game com-
pared to my usual you said well i
play all kinds of games whoever or
whatever annoys me i crush whether
its one poor bum like you or a mil-
lion-dollar concern get that but in
his case the cards are stacked for you
after my ward got home and before
meyer-before my man at hades re-
ported to me  promised id give you
a job miss way thought youd prob-
ably drift in here since you were com-
ing east andi promised-

  the door behind peter opened to
admit the gum-chewing office boy he
had reproached himself once peter was
out of sight with having let a momen-
tary terror of sudden death overcome
his convictions as to the equality of
man this principle he was now re-
solved to reassert

  man to see you he therefore told
john p henderson without troubling
to remove the gum from his front
teeth name of lockwood r lock-
jaw or somepn

  tell him said john p henderson
smoothly that i will see him in a mo-
ment and-boy  wait a moment
after that go to the manager of the
front office and tell him to give you
three days pay-this is wednesday
and then get out

  i get a weeks pay cried the boy
his utterance miraculously freed of the

gum in noo york-

  sue us for it suggested john p
henderson and get out

  wlen the boy had gone he picked
up the desk telephone to confirm these
instructions to the office manager di-
rect and in the moment he waited for
the number he fixed his eyes bright
with a sudden idea on peter

  nothing is too small for my per-
sonal attention he said you see

and i have just thought of a way out
of my dislike for giving you a job and

my promise to give you one if you
want to you can have a job you can
have the one that boys just vacated

  while he gave his instructions to
his manager the magnates eyes re-
mained on peters face mockingly tri-
umphantly then he put down the in-
strument with a erasli and leaned across
the table grinning like a wolf

  well  he asked

  for a single instant peters balled
list trembled to start on a journey to
that vulpine jaw but if he did that
or if he snarled as he wanted to that
he would rather starve john p hen-
derson would win and at the mo-
ment henderson had boasted that he
crushed whatever annoyed him peter
had been seized by an overpowering
impulse to do nothing for the rest of
his life but devote himself to annoying
john p henderson and not be crushed

   youre on he therefore said smil-
ing fifty a week or is it ten

  its twelve and a half said john
p henderson now go and show
colonel lockhart in again he gave
that wolf like grin from what i know
of you i imagine youd be rather in
sympathy with this old gentleman hes
a fighter too but like yourself not
quite fighter enough to fight me and
now youre going to show him into the
room where hes going to tap the mat
he cant work his virgin mine he
cant meet his notes and hes coming
here to kick in with his mine for my
price of twenty thousand dollars
youre a prospector - you know how
much its worth right there on the head
of the lode and who dyou think holds
the notes lie cant pay  whose money
dyou think it is thats ruined him he
came to borrow it off one of my banks
i wanted to lend it to him but our loan
quota was all full so i explained it to
my ward offered her fifty per cent of
the virgin mine when i got it in my
the misfit man

power and she advanced the money
he dont know that and i guess itll
about break his aged heart his own
niece show him in show him in
in the front office peter bent over
the wheel chair a frail silver-haired
old gentleman smiled up at him ques-
tion ingly

  im the man peter said hurriedly
that rescued your niece from those
men when she was visiting you in
hades city some time ago no i dont
want thanks never mind what im
doing here what i want to tell you
is-dont believe anything henderson
tells you this afternoon-dont believe
anything he shows you either and
above all dont sign anything away to
him will you promise

  yes but-

  is your niece in the east

 yes but-

  peter made a gesture of silence and
straightened himself

  this way he said to the aged negro
behind the chair

  he led the little procession to hen-
dersons office announced the colonel
closed the door and returned to his
desk for the rest of the afternoon as
he filled the late office boys place his
mind was busy composing a speech
which delivered to virginia way that
evening should point out to her the
enormity of her offense without-for
peter loved her in spite of this vile
affair-without hurting her too much
there was too the question of how
he should gain entrance in his shabby
clothes to the house of john p hen-
derson  but it was on the former prob-
lem that peters mind mainly dwelt
how could he tell the girl that he de-
tested and abhorred the thing she had
done and yet-and yet-and yet not

make her think-

  he puzzled over this until five oclock
that afternoon which merely proves
for the thousand and first time that the
only things we worry over are the things

which are destined automatically to ad-
just themselves

  on leaving the office peter bought
a newspaper going uptown in the sub-
way jammed like a sardine between a
polack two negroes a chinese and a
laborer from ohio he wriggled the
sheet upward and tried to read the
small portion of it that could be seen
while it was still folded there was
a line to the effect that four murderers
had been executed the night before in
sing sing prison the announcement of
the birth of a pig with two heads in
cranberry plains georgia and then
at the bottom of the column this

  austin texas the finding of a pros-
pectors pack on a hillside near hades cit
by a patrol of rangers sent out to quel
trouble at the mines has furnished a clew
to the missing heir of the late emery w
hayes of el paso the pack which had
apparently been thrown away contained a
birth certificate showing one peter martin
to have been the son of mr hayes sister
with whom he had quarreled some time be-
fore her marriage advertisements for her-
self or her children were about to be dis-
continued when this clew ws found the
estate amounts to about three quarters of a
million dollars

chapter iii

  it was a strangely bright-eyed ver-
sion of the usually calm peter martin
who at eight oclock that evening rested
a trembling hand on the mahogany desk
of the hotel biltmore and asked for
colonel lockhart there had been mo-
ments in his career as a prospector
when he had thought a million dollars
had sprung to light under the blow of
his hammer immediately there fol-
lowed moments showing the prospect
to have netted merely a dead loss of the
chemicals used in the assay

  neither discovery nor disillusionment
had ever previously made peters hand
shake enough to spill one drop of nitric
acid or shirk one flapjack of his usual
quota but this three quarters of a
million was different it had dropped
 go

peoples story magazine

  from nowhere as unexpectedly as the
  luckiest mining strike but it had
  dropped at such a moment it was not
  the amount of money which made the
  young man tremble as he addressed the
  reception clerk it was the thought of
  what in the peculiar circumstances the
  money stood for it was a compli-
  mentary ticket to the fight with hen-
  derson  it was the price of a chance for
  a wallop at the giant who prided him-
  self on closing chunks of gods coun-
  try to numbers of gods creatures who
   grinned at the joke of ruining an old
  man and who could go about this task
  by the method of turning a girl into a
  traitress

     colonel lockhart you said

    yes

    er-have you an appointment

    peter smiled and leaned across the
  counter

    yes i have and before you call
  the house detective let me tell you that
  i am neither a holdup man nor a re-
   ligious fanatic but merely a harmless
  westerner who has unexpectedly struck
  it rich if my clothes dont satisfy your
  taste blame providence for not letting
  me strike it rich in time to change
  now will you telephone the colonel or
  shall i commandeer an elevator for my-
  self

    oh- said the clerk

     the book of instructions he had un-
   der the counter which prescribed his
   course of action in every emergency
   from fire to earthquake and civil com-
   motion was silent upon the subject of
   howr to deal with persons who spoke
   in the exact variety of quiet tone em-
   ployed by this westerner the clerk
   therefore telephoned and five minutes
   later peter faced colonel lockhart
   across the dinner table in the old gen-
   tlemans two-room suite

    did yoit sign anything sir he
  demanded as soon as formal greeting
  had been exchanged

  no sad the colonel gravely but

 am at a loss-

  one moment-excuse me peter
broke in did he-tell you anything
the colonel shook his head

  in that connection hovveveh he
aid a little puzzled frown between his
brows he made what seemed to me an
extrorny threat mr martin when
i first entered the room he demanded
whether i was ready to come to time
and sell the virgin mine which in
point of fact  was but which in view
of what you had said  had decided to
deny the notes which will force me
to sell do not mature for anotheh two
weeks i pointed this out to him
upon which he said that he wasnt goin
to argue with me seh and called me
an unprintable variety of old fool seh
and said that if i kept him waiting much
longer he would not only ruin me but
would also break my heart

  peter compressed his lips

  i am at a loss how to deal with this
pusson in short said the colonel gen-
tly he is a most extrorny man
mr martin heartbreakin has not
previously seemed to me to be a neces-
sary part of business dealins howeveh
unscrupulous nor have i been accus-
tomed to seein a man who has just
called another an insultin name sum-
mon a gunman to protect him from the
result of his action

  i beg your pardon 

  when he called me the name to
which i have alluded said the colo-
nel gently i endeavoed to climb out
of my chaih to resent it suh upon
which with every manifestation of
feah mr henderson pressed a button
on his desk and summoned a sort oi
human ape with an automatic pistol in
his hand this bravo had actually been
in hidin in the room since befoah my
entry seh

  with a prickling of the hair on the
back of his neck peter congratulated
himself on having restrained that im-
the misfit man

pulse to smash john p henderson on
the jaw

  what did you do he asked colo-
nel lockhart

  i pointed out to mr henderson
said the old gentleman that he had
committed a serious breach of good
taste and expressed my displeasure by
at once leaving the room

  he smiled cheerfully at peter mar-
tin

  and now-if i may put it in the
form of a blunt question seh what are
you goin to do

  to be equally blunt said peter
martin how much are those notes
which fall due in two weeks

  for a moment the colonel hesitated
his eyes on peters face then im-
perceptibly nodding his head

  they aggregate he said about
eighty thousand dollars why

  i propose said peter to pay those
notes and to supply capital for the
resumption of work in the virgin
mine

  and in return you requiah-

  a half interest in the property
the colonels eyes narrowed he re-
peated his former question

 why

  to light henderson

  is that the only reason

  peter martin hesitated

  no he said quietly though it is
the reason which is actually pushing me
into this business as it were as a
paying proposition i think the virgin
is capable of making us both extremely
wealthy men now westerners havent
any faith in my judgment because they
think im an effete easterner and east-
erners dont take much stock in me be-
cause they think im a roughneck from
the west but i am a good prospector
and in my opinion the virgins not only
on the head of the lode but it hogs all
of the lode thats worth working i
believe henderson only grabbed those
other mines to get hold of the virgin
iibpeo

  my mine said colonel lockhart
slowly has never appeahed to turn
out a higher grade of ore than the
othehs seh

  have you ever had a good geolo-
gist go over the formations and tell you
where to cut

  the old gentleman shook his head
well said peter youve got one
now youve been tunneling south
havent you well i judge that you
are simply working one of the minor
striations by the contour of the land
and the character of the surface for-
mations i should guess that the main
lode went just about due north a
fault may cut off any signs of it but
im willing to bet all ive got that its
there

  a broad negroid voice sounded sud-
denly from the shadows of the room

  now cunnel member whut doc-
tuh say no excitement

  all right-all right matthew the
colonel replied smiling his eyes were
fastened on peters face he added
i am not supposed in view of this
wound seh to give way to any emo-
tion this aftehnoons entertainment
upset me considerably hm hm
i confess that this news of yours is
inclined to stimulate my heartbeat
the old man leaned back in his chair
and for a moment closed his eyes

  without wishing to appeah curi-
ous he said i should-ah-like to
ask you seh the source of your wealth
my niece-er-did not convey the im-
pression-

  briefly peter gave the details the
colonel heard him his eyes still closed
at last

  matthew he said softly go fetch
a lawyer

  lawyeh cunnel

  yes i wish to draw up a contract

with-

  if youll pardon me said peter
i should prefer that there should be
no contract if you agree to my pro-


peoples story magazine

posal colonel lockhart your word is
sufficient walls have ears where john
p henderson is concerned and law-
yers have tongues

  i can scarcely believe- began

the old man

  your notes for eighty thousand dol-
lars asked peter who hokls them
why the-eh-fourth national
bank of butte

  another name said peter slowly
for john p henderson had you
asked to have them renewed no
well you see how much use it would
have been colonel that mans an oc-
topus hes everywhere lies taken
in the broken mountain held the
broad river mines the gold creek
field-and all the banks and transporta-
tion facilities connected with them he
owns those places as he does his ciga-
rette case if he gets the virgin mine
hell own the hades flats just the same
already he owns the banks there the
only reason we have a chance is that
he hasnt tied up the railroads he
thinks he can get his monopoly with-
out that expense if he gets any ad-
vance information about this plan hell
tie them up and our only chance will
be gone

  but in the event of mv death-

  ill chance that

  the colonel smiled

  you put me to shame mr martin
i was about to requiah your word of
honor that you did not come to me as
an agent of mr henderson i lo not
requiah it i shall be obliged if you
will proceed with your plans i give
you carte blanche i fear i shall not
be of much assistance

  cunnel boomed the negroid voice
whuffor you got to get all xcited agin
like ol warhawse dis young gem-
mun look afteh affais fo us you sit
still

  think he will matthew the
colonel smiled well im something
of the same opinion as regards the

-eh-the prospect of my untimely de-
mise mr martin i have willed my in-
terest in the mine to miss viginia
way whom you know i shall write
her a letter stating my arrangement
with you and i am suah-

  peters lips compressed themselves

  pd rather you didnt he said
she-well-shes in the same house
with henderson and with the best in-
tentions-

    he old man waved his hand wearily

  just as you like he said i-i
am rather tired i think most un-
businesslike arrangement i suppose-
gentlemen of honor-

  cunnel- began the voice of

matthew

  i hope however said colonel
lockhart that you will keep me ad-
vised as to tlie progress of the battle

  peter smiled and nodded

  i should be honored to shake your
hand seh said the colonel weakly
and afteh that i-think-i will go-
to bed good evening mr martin
an-good luck

  peter was waiting for the elevator
at the other end of the passage when
he heard his name called and saw mat-
thew running after him the blue and
white of a telegram in one dusky paw

  dis just come by bell hop through
service elevator oh lawd the darky
moaned i darent give it to cunnel
less he die oh pharaoh an de op-
pressors in egyp what wicked men
de lawd let live in de wort i

  peter took the telegram and read

   shaft dynamited last night by parties un-
known all lower levels blocked north wall
of main shaft caved in at forty feet derrick
and machinery uninjured wire instructions
williams superintendent

  and before he had recovered from
this body blow-a week later to be
exact during which period he lived and
paid for frantic telegrams to el paso by
pawning the clothes he stood up in
f

the misfit man

fate dealt him another soul-staggering
smash

 a week before he was due to pay off
colonel lockharts note for eighty
thousand dollars which would expose
bis part in the game and turn thfe light
against henderson into an open fight
of money against money and brains
against brains lie received a letter from
the firm of lawyers who were adminis-
tering his uncles estate saying that
though the court formalities transfer-
ring the bulk of the estate to peters
possession would not be concluded for
two or three more days they were
sending him in view of his urgent re-
quest five hundred dollars on their own
responsibility

  we regret however to inform
you ended the letter that owing to
the failure of the texas sheep-raising
corporation in which the testator was
heavily interested the estate cannot now
be expected to amount to more than
one hundred thousand dollars

  a wrecked mine and twenty thou-
sand available dollars against hender-
sons perfect organization and twenty
millions the fight was impossible

  sitting there in his cheap hall room
his clothing cut down to the irreducible
minimum of a jacket a shirt trousers
and a pair of worn-out shoes peter
seemed to hear john p hendersons
smooth voice pronouncing the doom of
all who had the temerity to cross the
magnates plans a flood of fury shook
the young man

  by jiminy he cried suddenly ris-
ing and shaking his desert-browned fist
at the white-marble outline of the sky-
scrapers visible through his window
by jiminy he shant crush me

chapter tv

  williams the superintendent of the
virgin mine was as peter had already
learned from colonel lockhart an old-
timer and to be trusted immediately
after the news of the dynamiting of the



mine peter had wired him in the colo-
nels name to post guards about the
shaft and machinery and make sure
that no further damage was done
now still in the colonels name he
sent a long telegram ordering williams
to make a careful survey of the point
at which the dynamite had torn down
the north wall of the shaft if as
peter had guessed the main lode ran
north instead of south it was just pos-
sible that the blast fired where the
owners of the mine would never have
dared fire it might have opened up
the possibilities of the mine instead of
burying them under the hundreds of
tons of debris which had crashed to the
bottom of the shaft

  two days elapsed and then williams
wired back with a strange effusiveness
in his wording that the blast cavity
showed traces of an ore-bearing forma-
tion he added that it seemed rich
though he had as yet had no assay it
seemed so rich to him in fact that he
actually spent extra money finishing his
message with the words by golly

  peter read that telegram with his
heart pounding then with a new look
of hope in his face he spoke to the
aged negro who had handed him the
telegram outside the door of colonel
lockharts suite

  has colonel lockhart seen this
he began and then matthew-
whats the matter

  the colored mans eyes were full of
tears he was wagging his white head
from side to side in the peculiar man-
ner of his race when under the influ-
ence of grief

  cunne ain seen dat wire he said
brokenly i wuz gwine tell you when
you git so absorbed in it cunnel ain
seen nothin since late las night when
he write letter to miss viginia come
finish dat letter he tun to me v say
matt guess you better fetch doctuh
i fetch doctuh on de jump time i
come back cunnel mighty sick man


peoples story magazine

ain et nothin since ain spoke no
word ain done nothin but lie still
ginral breakdown due to shock doc-
tuh say oh my merciful lawd ol
cunnel break down so fah fm home

  peters nails bit into his palm this
too was hendersons work

  he laid a hand on the negros heav-
ing shoulders

  has miss virginia been here yet
he asked

  matthew shook his head

  shell probably be in during the
day peter said his mind whirling be-
tween this catastrophe and the unbeliev-
ably good news contained in the tele-
gram ill be back later too have
you got enough money to be going on
with 

  i guess we has said the old serv-
ant with dignity thank you suh but
if miss viginia come she cant see
cunnel doctuh say nobody to see cun-
el

  peter thought a moment there was
nothing he could do here and with the
payment of the note only four days
distant every moment of his time was
priceless

  matthew he said at last im go-
ing to move from my present address
to the grosvenor id come here but
it-might give the game away tele-
grams about mine business will still
come here addressed to the colonel
call me on the telephone about them
or anything else you may want its
just around the corner from here and
i can be with the colonel in five min-
utes if im wanted get that

  matthew nodded

  meanwhile said peter handing
him the telegram keep this and when
the colonel wakes read it to him itll
do him more good than forty-eight
hours sleep and a gallon of medicine
now pm going

  a yard away he paused and turned

  did the colonel he asked have
any friends back near hades city who

were bankers any personal friends

i mean

   use to smoke a lot of cigars with
major carter that use to be in ol
regiment with him said matthew

  to major carter accordingly at the
first national bank of hades city
peter sent another telegram

  got capital to meet all present liabilities
and leave surplus but not immediately avail-
able attempt to wreck mint- has oprned rich
vein we control main lode on this show-
ing can your bank make ine ninety-day loan
until capital is on hand

  to this lie signed the colonels name
and then after some moments of hesi-
tation he pulled from his pocket the
little book the colonel had given him
and composed a message in code it
was to williams tlie superintendent
and it ordered him to hire as many men
as he could get from outside the sphere
of hendersons influence on the prom-
ise of double wages pavable two-
wceklv and to get to work driving tun-
nels off the blast cavity

  peter had no money wherewith to go
into the market for labor he was in
this fight alone without money with-
out experience and without advice
the cash payment of his legacy would
in all probability not arrive in time to
take care of the note whether the
hades city bank would make a loan
on the sketchy security he had indi-
cated in the telegram was extremely
problematical he had not in fact the
slightest idea of how the large payment
was to be met in the meantime all
he could do was bluff

  for the remainder of that day he
worked on the construction of a bluff
which if hendersons spies were on his
trail as he considered it extremely
probable they were should fill hender-
son with uneasiness using his paltry
five hundred dollars with as much aban-
don as if it were an inexhaustible gold
mine he engaged an expensive suite at
the grosvenor bought a ready-made
the misfit mah



suit of clothes that cost one hundred
and twenty dollars and at the moment
when virginia ways note reached him
that evening was engaged in the con-
sumption of a dinner valued ly the
hotel at nine dollars and seventy-three
cents

  my dear mr martin it ran i
should like to see you the matter is
extremely important can you come
to my guardians house this evening

  the address- was given-fifth ave-
nue in the exclusive sixties hastily
peter signed the check called for his
hat and took a taxi up the avenue
the distance was one which he had
walked several thousand times over
burning sand burdened with a pack and
extremely short of water but he was
going into the enemys camp and he
had no money in the topsy-turvy
world of new york the circumstances
demanded that he arrive in the most
expensive manner possible

  virginia the butler informed him
was in the drawing room he was an-
nounced and entered and as the girl
rose from the bench of a grand piano
bowed formally to her

  she paused halfway to him her
hand in the act of being extended
paused and fell to her side

  you wished to see me peter asked

  yes-i wanted to see you the girl
answered but-are you angry with
me or something

  peter looked at her in her dress of
cloth of silver glittering in the rose
light of half a dozen lamps each of
which was worth probably more than
the whole of his present cash resources
she appeared to the young man even
more beautiful than she had in the
stalled flivver on the hades city road
in fact she was to all appearances quite
a different person differently situated
and capable of quite different things
it may be very true that all is not gold
that glitters and that appearances are
deceptive but proverbs to that effect

notwithstanding it will require a revolu-
tion to make the human race stop taking
at least a passing interest in iron pyrites
and several more revolutions to prevent
it forming judgments as to character on
a basis of outward appearance

   peter martin was not afflicted by the
fictional idea that all well-dressed east
terners were of necessity villains but
the fact remains that had he now seen
virginia arrayed in a khaki suit and the
high boots customary around hade
city he would probably in spite of his
worry and anxiety have been more care-
ful of the manner in which be ap-
proached the delicate subject of the
girls alleged loan to henderson

  no he said slowly im not an-
gry miss virginia but im puzzled
i guess you know im kind of in part-
nership with colonel lockhart on the
virgin mine proposition it was a
shock to me to find that the person whos
holding the notes that are liable to ruin
us is yourself

   a spasm of iain flitted across the
girls face

  do you deny that you hold them
it was a plea but peter was too agi-
tated to care about histrionics and the
words came forth with the curtness of
a defiance virginia ways face whit-
ened her eyes fixed on peters face
were cold

   under the circumstances she said
icily i dont think i should feel like
denying it formally even if it were un-
true as it happens i do hold the
notes have you any further remarks
to make on the subject 

   peter shook his head

   no he said huskily were fight-
ing henderson and so long as our ob-
ligations are in his control it doesn t
much matter whose name appears on
the documents rather surprised its
yours though and a bit puzzled as
to what you want to talk to me about
things being as they are

  his sorrow was so evident that for




peoples story magazine

a moment the girls insuked pride re-
lented

  i-might be willing to renew the
notes she said half smiling had that
occurred to you 

  peter raised his head no smile ap-
peared on his face

  if its all the same to you miss vir-
ginia he said gravely i dont think
youd better the colonels mighty ill
as you know im not sure whether he
could attend to his end of the formal-
ities and if he could it might be better
for him to have to pay the money when

its due than to know that-er-

  he stopped short before the look in
virginias eyes

  you mean she said slowly to
know that his favorite niece had sold
him out is that it

  peter hesitated suddenly the girls
anger blazed up as a matter of fact
it was a question whether she should
storm with rage or with tears and be-
ing more inclined toward the latter
womanlike she considered it a point of
honor to choose the former course

  i hate you she cried-rather sur-
prisingly considering that the conven-
tions in view of their half hours total
acquaintance would scarcely have al-
lowed her any emotions at all toward
this comparative stranger i hate you 
 brought you here to-night to tell you
that my uncle had written me and that
i would do what he asked in regard to
giving you your interest in the mine
should i come into possession of it

through his death hes so ill-

  the tears however heroically forced
back now insisted on making their ap-
pearance virginia sank on the music
bench from which she had risen
dropped her head on her outstretched
arms and sobbed

  peter moved over to her side

  miss virginia- he began this

outburst of weeping in his opinion was
due to remorse but suddenly it came
over the young man in a wave that no

matter of what treachery this girl had
been guilty no matter what she had
done he loved her and didnt want her
to cry moreover for one chivalric in-
stant he absolutely refused to believe
that she had joined in the conspiracy
against the colonel his hand hesitated
over her shaking shoulder

  i- he began

  as suddenly as she had sunk to the
bench she rose brushing his arm as she
did so

  virginia- peter began again

  her eyes blazed into his

  good night she said quietly and
then as he stood quite still dazed by
the alternating impulses to leave her
and to take her in his arms she turned
and walked from the room

  scarcely had the brocaded portieres
fallen behind her than they were lifted
again and john p henderson entered

  ah mr martin- he began smil-
ing

  peter was advancing toward the door

  get out of my way he said he
was still wondering just what had hap-
pened at the stormy interview just past
he had a vague idea-that he did not be-
lieve virgina had betrayed her uncle to
her guardian yet he had clearly in his
mind her admission that she held the
notes he had not much thought to
spare for john t henderson and the
impersonal quality of his order to clear
the wav was terrifying

  jenks gasjed the magnate

  the quiet individual of whom colo-
nel lockhart had spoken arrived noise-
lessly at his masters side pisiol ready
and acting as it were automatically
peter martin hit him under the jaw with
iis right hand while with the left he
wrenched the weapon from the private
detectives grasp something about thi
action seemed to bring him into close
rapport with his surroundings it was
more or less natural for a man who
didnt like you to pull a gun and for you
to hit him in the most lethal place avail-
the misfit man



able and take the gun from him after
a period of this eastern method of
fighting with sums of money and prom-
issory notes and so on a touch of na-
ture was refreshing

  peter stuffed the pistol into his
pocket and looked at the shrinking finan-
cier with a new light in his eyes

   its all right he assured him calmly
im not going to hurt you wouldnt
have hurt this guy if he hadnt started
exhibiting that gun now whalt was it
you wanted to say

  staring at the man before him john
p henderson realized that the danger
of further physical violence was past
he therefore after the manner of his
kind became extremely bold for the
prostrate jenks now beginning to roll
aimlessly on his side and to paw blindly
at his masters boots mr henderson
also after the manner of his kind felt
 concern at all

  never mind about your plotting with
my ward the financier almost
screamed shaking his finger in peters
impassive face i know what im play-
ing at and all your western stunts
wont alter what youre going to get
you think you can come and play east-
erner you hick you think you can
get my ward to double cross me for her
old fool of an uncle do you think
t didnt foresee that possibility well
i did and if you want to examine
that note youll find that while the
moneys hers the question of extending
the note or demanding payment isnt up
to her but up to me now get that
it cost me five hundred dollars to have
that note drawn up i had the best law-
yer in the united states do it and its
as iron-clad as a battleship put that in
your pipe and smoke it

  peter felt in his breast pocket

  so he asked pulling out of the

hundred-and-twenty-dollar suit a small
muslin sack of tobacco and a packet of
yellow papers i dont smoke a ppej
but i guess a cigarette will do as well

  what have you got to say to that
henderson demanded in a voice hoarse
with rage what have you got to say
to that eh

   peter had rolled his cigarette

  just what i said before he re-
marked feeling for a match and that
is-get out of the way

  he walked out into the crisp air of
the avenue feeling strangely light-
hearted he had frequently seen gam-
blers out west start a game with five
hundred dollars and a grouch and won-
dered why they suddenly became hilari-
ous when they had lost everything but
the minimum of clothing and were
about to stake that on the longest chance
on the board now he understood
matters in this gamble of his were about
as bad as it was possible for them to
be and the feeling that whatever he
did he could make them no worse and
that the only change possible would be
for the better gave him a most enjoy-
able sensation of freedom

  what however was there to do
this was thursday the note for eighty
thousand dollars would fall due on sat-
urday he could wait for news from
his lawyers he could wait for the banks
reply on that wild-goose application for
a loan  he could await williams report
as to whether or not labor had been
secured to work the mine

  wait-wait-wait

  ite felt savagely that if he were out
in hades city where a mans fists and
personality as distinct from his lower
nature and his bank account-were of
some use to him he could busy himself
about something he could go out and
grab a little labor himself for instance
and stand over the men as they worked
in the tunnel henderson had blasted in
the virgin mine-watching with his
own eyes for the ore signs which should
announce that his troubles and colo-
nel lockharts were over for if the
virgin mine did turn out to be on the
main lode if it could be shown conclu-
peoples story magazine

sively that it was able to produce richer
ore at a lower cost than the other mines
in the neighborhood it would be pos-
sible to borrow not only eighty thou-
sand dollars but eight hundred thou-
sand if necessary and not from the
petty political banks of hades city and
its environs but from the big bankers
of chicago and new york

  but peter was not in the w est he
was here in the east and there was
nothing to do he had had a wild im-
pulse to go and see the general freight
agent of the railroad which served
hades city and to assure a free outlet
for the mines product when the prod-
uct should be available but that activity
was ruled out as premature and as be-
ing liable to alarm henderson to the
point of tightening his grip on the rail-
road and finally closing it up to the
virgins traffic

  walking rapidly peter swung from
the sidewalk dodged five buses and
three taxicabs and entered central
park absorbed in his thoughts he
did not notice where he was going he
left the main path and following a nar-
row asphalted alley was far from even
the solitude-loving park-bench spoon-
ers when suddenly he hearda scuffle of
feet behind him and turned just in time
to receive the united assault of two men
who sprang at his throat to one of
these-a short thickset man in a wide-
brimmed hat he awarded a left swing
that sent the assailant rolling the sec-
ond man ducking a tremendous right
destined for his jaw seized peter with
a grip of iron planted his knee in his
chest threw him backward and fell on
him

  come on shorty peter heard him
gasp as they rolled about the pavement
in each others grip

  it would have been difficult for
shorty to afford any great assistance
however even had he been conscious
which he was not the man who had
fallen on peter was of just about pe-

ters size and strength the breath had
been knocked out of him quite as much
as out of his victim by the heavy fall
the fight was very even and neither
man seemed able to maintain the upper
position for more than the fraction of
a second peter his weight thrown
well forward his knees cramped around
his adversarys chest was just about to
tighten his grip on the others throat
when a heave of the powerful legs be-
hind him spilled him over his assailants
head in another instant the big man
had crawled forward on his knees a
yard and then thrown himself unre-
servedly on peters chest not a word
was spoken except that once as peters
fisit came heavily home on his antago-
nists nose the injured man gasped
jee-miny

  it was scarcely five seconds after this
exclamation had broken the snarling si-
lence that peter put into execution a
trick he had chanced to pick up in the
west suddenly relaxing all his mus-
cles he lay as if unconscious and when
the man on his chest loosed tiis grip and
leaned closer in the apprehension of hav-
ing killed him tensed the muscles of his
right arm and sent the fist whizzing to
the jaw it was the upper mans turn
to relax now and he did it very com-
pletely he rolled off peter with the
apparent object of burying his face in
the asphalt and lay still

  peter rose the hundred-and-twenty-
dollar suit was torn beyond repair and
there was not in the treasury the cash
wherewith to replace it but he felt bet-
ter than he had for some time now
if all the scrapping in connection with

the mine-

  i didnt know said a sleepy voice
from near his feet that that trick had
traveled east o salt lake yit oh lord
you never can tell can yuh

  it was the big man whom peter had
knocked out second he was regain-
ing consciousness he was already on
his knees and struggling to rise farther
the misfit man

and he spoke with a most unmistakably
western drawl

  peter slipped a hand under each arm
and helped his fallen foe to his feet

  gosh said the risen warrior ten-
derly feeling the point of his jaw you
certainly pack a punch stranger
where did yuh learn that possum
trick 

  i forget just where i think if was
likely in dalys saloon in pueblo indio
are you from the west

  i am and i wish said peter that
i was back there

  his late assailant shot out a large
paw

  im with you brother he said
hoarsely an im all broke up to have
jumped on your neck soll shorty
there be when he learns whats what
i think i see him movin his left fist
now hey shorty wake up this
gents a friend

   you see mister he continued rais-
ing his unconscious friend and fanning
him gently me an shorty had good
jobs with cattle outfits down south of
salt lake an we seen advertisements
offerin expert ropers year-round jobs
with some kind of a circus or somepn
it said to write but we didnt figure
that was necessary we just took our
ropes an hit the rattler come to the
fellers address in noo york an all it
was was a kind of an office i dunno
just how it was supposed to work out
but the idea was that you paid this guy
money instead of him payin it you
he didnt have no circus that was
why he wanted you to write well by
the time shorty and me was through
with him he didnt have no office nei-
ther an mighty little countenance that
his mamma would have recognized
well if youll believe it they arrested
us an in spite of the fact that this guy-
had done us out of nigh on six months
wages in railroad fares an twenty dol-
lars would have paid all his doctors
bills it was us the judge picked on

thirty days each an he said that if we
hadnt bin poor ignorant westerners
hed ha soaked us a lot more pears
the way to do back east here when a
guys got a lot of your jack offn you
is to go air pay more jack to lawyers
 the off chance of gettin it hack
rotten system i call it ever run up
against it yourself

  you bet your life said peter re-
lieving the big man at the fanning of
shorty but if youre just out of jail
for violence whats the big idea of
jumping on my neck thats a good
way to get back

  that was just our idea said the
big man to get back-home - we aint
had anythin to eat since we got off the
island an there aint anybody thatll
employ us to do anythin apparently so
we got desperate the way to get
money without workin for it here
seems to be to get a tin cup an pretend
youre blind but me an shorty didnt
seem able to stomach that so we fig-
ured to pick out a guy just about as
well dressed as the jasper that swindled
us an take what we needed off him in
a straightforward manner i figure its
no use tryin to fight these easterners
with their own weapons theyre used
to them an we aint you dont see any
of them cornin west an tryin to win
fame an fortune competin with tis
westerners at shootin ridin or ropin
do yuh  not much they stick to their
own weapons-finances an six per cent
an all that well slongs im in the
east im goin to fight for my livin the
way ini accustomed to

  shorty brushed -his hand across his
eyes

  are we at chicago yet red he
asked sleepily gosh i dreamed we
had a train wreck memory returned
to him hey red he complained
i thought you said these easterners
wouldnt figure on havin their jack took
offn em honestly lookit that guy
hes a westerner said red sadly
 

  what in them duds hey mister
where you from

  peter made no answer his brows
contracted in a frown he was staring
at the gold cap of the obelisk which
shone dimly in the moonlight

  mister said red pulling at his
trouser leg our little invalid heres
askin-say you aint hurt are yuh
peter woke up

  no-pm just thinking he said
something you said kind of made me
think seems to me ive been making
a big mistake

  for a moment he stared at red and
shorty thoughtfully then put his hand
in his pocket

  im going to fix you boys up with
chow and a place to sleep peter said
slowly no-it isnt charity youve
just given me a big idea and you may
have to help me work it out i want to
have you handy

  steak  muttered shorty hungrily as
he rose to his feet smothered in
onions say mister will it run to on-
ions dyuh think

  whats the big idea asked the
more cautious red taking in his belt
four holes in case of disappointment

  why said peter slowly ive been
kidding myself that im just as good an
easterner as the people thatve lived
here all their lives ive been trying to
fight them with their own weapons
he handed shorty one ten-dollar bill
and red another they noticed in the
moonlight that his eyes were dancing
strangely

  thats the first installment of your
pay for giving me the idea that ive been
all wrong the way to fight the devil
isnt with fire you cant catch a fish by
swimming after him and whod try to
lick a steer by tying on horns and charg-
ing on all fours

  nobody said red

  accordingly with your kind assist-
ance said peter martin grimly the
next round of my battle with these east-

  peoples story magazine

erners will be fought strictly a la den-
ver and points west

chapter v

  on the morning of saturday the
fateful day on which the note fell due
the desk clerk of the grosvenor spoke
to the manager of tlie hotel as that
worthy passed on his way to breakfast

   us all right he said mysteriously
about two hundred and twelve

  the managers eye brightened

has he paid up he demanded

  the clerk shook his head

  no say we nearly made a mis-
take about that guy i liad a sort of
idea myself he was a dead beat those
swell clothes somehow didnt seem to
go with him but he isnt hes a west-
erner-big mining guy or something
rolled into the lobby yesterday in a bally
white sombrero and-well i dont know
what else he had on but he looked west
ern all right then last night he got
a registered letter from a bank out
there-came over from somebody at the
biltmore and this morning he phoned
down that if anyt letter came for him
from a firm of lawyers we were to get
it to him at once wherever he was
and one place hes going to this morn-
ing is the henderson mining corpora-
tion i see by the papers theree a di-
rectors meeting there to-day

  the manager nodded

  give him anything in the honse he
said

   then again last night pursued the
clerk he had a couple of regular rough-
necks call on him-cow-punchers or
something had em up and chinned
with em for the best part of two hours
no dead beatd dare have people dressed
like theyr were come around

  again the manager nodded

  i saw em he agreed say cash
his checks up to five hundred dollars
and be careful about his bill these
guvs have got eyes like hawks i re-
the misfit man



member one time i took a man from

nevada for a boob and--

   tup in room  while the manager
continued his reminiscences mr peter
martin fresh from the shower bath and
busy with the lying of a white silk four-
in-hand designed to hang gracefully
over the bosom of a khaki silk shirt
whistled tunelessly through his teeth as
he regarded the bank letter which had
so increased his prestige

   as is the way with letters from banks
 the exterior had been more pleasant to
 the eye than the interior for in courtly
 language major carter informed his old
 friend the colonel that while the bank
 was willing to stretch a point on its
 knowledge of the colonel and  the
 majors personal recommendation some
 security more substantial than a mere
 geological guess must be forthcoming
 if shipments of ore from the mine could
 begin-if only one train load of the al-
 leged main-lode ore could be actually
 dispatched something might be done
 until then ore was actually on the rails

however-

   peter got his tie to his liking strolled
 over to the telephone and spoke

   no sign of that lawyers letter yet
 he asked

  sorry no mr martin the desk
clerk replied is there anything we
could do in that connection

   peters eyebrows raised themselves
half ail inch

   no thanks he said except that
when a couple of men call for me you
might ask them to wait down there and
call me theyll be here before eleven
-ive an appointment theh

  the appointment at eleven is the
henderson directors meeting the clerk
informed the manager a moment later
aint i the swell little guesser

  he was and he was not for peter
martin was going to attend the direc-
tors meeting not as the honored guest
of the clerks imagination but as a des-
perate man making a desperate plav at

 the eleventh hour and the fifty-ninth
 minute yesterday peter had called
 henderson on the telephone and told
 him there were certain facts he would
 like to bring to his notice before the
 note was finally disposed of hender-
 son had suggested that he bring him-
 self and his arguments down to the di-
 rectors meeting also that he prepare
 himself for a disappointment

  i dont know what the facts are
henderson had snarled but theyll
have to be world beaters youre not
going to plead old lockharts illness
are you 

  hes worse than he was peter had
replied gravely i thought of mention-
ing it

  listen get this my associates on
the board are hard men but im harder
i dont think any of us are liable to be
impressed whether one old guy dies or
not im not at least and its my sig-
nature thats necessary for a renewal
now do you want to come down 

  yes

  all right henderson had snapped
then waste your nickel if you wrant to
eleven sharp

  however it was at a cost of four
dollars for a taxicab and at twenty min-
ittes past eleven that peter closely fol-
lowed by red and shorty entered the
outer office of the henderson mining
corporation the fresh office boy was
of  course no longer there and the eld-
erly man who had taken peters place
at the desk was courteous respect in
fact was visible on the faces of all
within the office as their eyes rested on
the conspicous white stetson which had
absorbed peters last twenty dollars and
on the concomitant silk shirt and typi-
cal baggy jacket with a grim smile
as he gave his name the young man re-
flected that the proverb about imitating
the romans when in rome didnt go
for new york at all

  mr henderson left orders that you
were to be admitted to the directors


peoples story magazine

meeting mr martin said the elderly

man but lie didnt mention-er-

  evidently in new york the thing to
do was to stand outside this twopenny-
halfpenny barrier while you stated your
business and explained yourself what
peter asked himself would he have
done in a similar situation in the west
why he would have stepped over the
low railing and cut short the discussion
by walking in to the directors meeting
he accordingly did so here

  friends of mine he said carelessly
to the elderly man as red and shorty
gravely followed him toward the closed
door ill explain to mr henderson
then in a low voice to his companions
ready 

  shortys hand traveled rapidly to the
rear of his trousers red patted his hip
and smiled both nodded

  from inside the room as peter turned
the handle of the glass door came the
sound of a shrill voice

  i dont care what you say hender-
son it cried this stuffs danger-
ous i dont know whether there could
be trouble at law about it but some of

these westerners-

  the door swung open admitting
peter and his two friends silently red
closed it behind them and remained
with his vast body obscuring the portal
peter with shorty at his heels advanced
to the table in the middle of the room
laid his white stetson on the mahog-
any and gazed in turn at each of the
six men surrounding the board

  yes he asked a small pasty-faced
fat man whose mouth had been jammed
open by surprise in the act of speech
you were saying-some of these

westerners- 

  suddenly from over peters shoul-
der the rasping voice of shorty cut into
theproceedings

  you take your hand offn that bell
button  he snapped at henderson
quick

  an instant later his hand under the

tails of his coat the little man from
south of salt lake had stepped in front
of peter martin he fixed hendersons
eyes with bis own which were strangely
narrowed and the financiers hand
stopped in mid-air for the moment in
fact it seemed tiiat the whole board of
directors had been struck by some force
capable of arresting animation they
sat perfectly still they scarcely seemed
to breathe their jaws mostly decorated
by three or more chins sagged over
their collars

   he first sound was from the pasty-
faced man who had been speaking

  d-d-dont k-k-k-kill me he moaned
i d-didnt d-do it oh my god hen-
derson-

  shut up snarled the magnate at the
head of the table cant you control
yourself they darent do anything
peter martin seated himself at the
opposite end of the board and shook
his head indulgently

  youre wrong he said gently
quite wrong mr henderson in fact
the only jasper here thats really right
so far is the wailing coyote yonder
hes never seen me dressed up in new
york togs trying to play the new york
game-like a fool-and so he looks at
me now and takes me at face value
and hes right mr henderson face
value is my middle name these are
the clothes im used to wearing and this
is the way its natural for me to act
so if youve got any idea that im do-
ing any fancy-dress stuff drop it
henderson jaled a little the blue
pockets under his puffy eyes stood out
more distinctly

  what do you want he said thickly
i want said peter quietly that
you should renew that note of colonel
lockharts for another seven days

  tlhe blood that had receded from
hendersons face rushed back in a pur-
ple flood

  i wont he roared thundering his
fist down on the table
the misfit man



  i wouldnt be so sure peter ad-
vised him anyhow you might wait
until  m through with my argument
out west there a kind of unwritten
law that when a mans old or when hes
sick his obligations are let to ride as
it were guess we got that idea from
watching the wolves we have out there
when an old wolf gets sick the rest of
the pack turn on him and tear him to
pieces we didnt much want to he like
wolves so  guess we figured to do dif-
ferently

  we arent in the west now snarled
one of the directors

  peter looked at him so did shorty
the hand still on the hip so did the
saturnine red from his post by the door

  i-i-i- babbled the director

suddenly

  when you say youre not in the
west now peter told him slowly
youre right and youre wrong geo-
graphically youre in new york city
socially speaking youre a long way
past chicago and still traveling be-
cause wherever you happen to be sit-
ting youre dealing with a westerner
and i dont want you to forget it
shorty

  uh-huh

  say somebody gypped an old man
that was a friend of yours into a con-
tract that he couldnt live up to any-
way and then took advantage of the old
mans being sick to grab something of
his worth a million dollars for nothing
almost-what would you do

  me asked shorty

  yes peter said drumming gently
with his fingers on the table you
personally

  id kill him said shorty

  how about getting hanged for it or
something 

  shorty drew a long breath through
his teeth

  well he said slowly what about
it

  a shudder convulsed the board of di-

rectors the pasty-faced man groaned
from the bottom of this soul

  there was a long interval of dead
silence

  do you know i feel very much that
way myself said peter slowly and
thats what ive come here to tell you
gentlemen mind im not saying that
youll either sign that extension of time
or be killed im not making any
threats there are six of you here and
there are three of us youre eastern-
ers and were from the west theres
a question up to us both in different
ways your chairman there hender-
son lhas told me that questions got to
be acted upon to-day well now its
up to you to act on it do just as you
feel like all im telling you is that
you mustnt blame us if we claim the
privilege of acting the way we feel like
too

  he rose to his feet red in answer
to a glance left the door and strode
forward his hands on his hips

  for gods sake sign it hender-
son  moaned the puffy man with tlie
shrill voice sign it sign it theyll
kill us

  henderson stared at peter and mar-
tin immobile with his supporters to
each side of him stared back the eyes
of tlhe other directors fixed on the three
grim men in the unfamiliar clothing
bulged glassily

  t wont-- began henderson

  as if with one motion the right hands
of peter shorty and red slipped up-
ward to their hips

  surely never before did a hand move-
ment of perhaps six inches produce
such a panic in wall street most of
those present had watched in the curb
market wigwag signals which meant
the gain or loss of thousands of dol-
lars without turning a hair but when
three financially negligible persons made
a movement they had not seen before
they with one accord grunted gurgled
or screamed according to their several


peoples story magazine

natures and flung themselves on hen-
derson

   sign it sign it theyre going to
 kill us

   shortys voice cut through the baliel

   dont touch that bell button hen-
 derson 

  if he wont-sign-it gasped the
pasy millionaire lets vote him out of
office i put it to the vote those in
favor-

  aye aye oh my god-theyre
going to kill us-

  will you asked henderson of rhe
pasty man agree to indemnify my
ward if anything goes wrong

   of course i will screamed the cow-
 ard ill pay her a hundred thou-
 sand-

   then ill sign

  drawing the document in question
from among the pile of papers lie fore
him he scrawled an indorsement signed
with a flourish and threw the paper
across the table to peter who examined
it signed his name as agent for colonel
lockhart and threw it back

   the board of directors gave vent to
 a composite sigh of agonized relief

  at that moment shorty and red
simultaneously withdrew their hands
from their hip pockets each drew
forth a stick of tobacco into which he
bit with relish peter making a simi-
lar motion produced a muslin sack and
a packet of cigarette papers he
smiled

   i am obliged to you gentlemen he
 said turning toward the door good
 day

   the board of directors snarled with
 rage henderson quieted them

   you think you will be able to meet
 this note next saturday at this hour
 he asked peter with an evil smile

   i think so

  i dont said john p henderson
good day

  and on monday morning peter
learned the meaning of those words

  in response to an urgent code wire
sent late on saturday night urging dou-
ble shifts at the virgin mine and the
quick dispatch of the trainload of on
which would serve as a basis for major
carters loan the superintendent wired
back to peter

   surry all work tied tip by strike on orders
of henderson mine picketed fear bad trouble
what shall  do williams

  with this the room clerk sent up to
peter the long-expected letter from the

los angeles lawyers

  torn open by trembling fingers the
envelope yielded a message to the effect
that due to causes beyond the lawyers
control no remittance could be made for
another two weeks at least

chapter vi

  if hades city was repulsive by night
it was beyond comparison more so by
day and it reached its nadir when as
on the thursday following peters in-
terview with henderson in new york
circumstances liberated the mine work
ers to lounge away the day in the bak-
ing streets the houses in hades city
were built of unpainted boards knocked
together without the aid of plumb or
level the roofs were of galvanized iron
whose thick coating of rust seemed to
give it no insulating properties against
the heat

  a local wit had once said that if hades
was tthe oven hades city was the fire-
less cooker he had based this observa-
tion on the chronic state of the ther-
mometer indoors and out from april
to october but the inhabitants had sus-
pected him of an allusion to their per-
sonal appearance about which they
were justly sensitive and the wit had
been buried just back of the heres how
tea house he had leen a stranger any-
way and hades city was a close cor-
poration

  strangers as con meyer had fre-
quently told tthe towns population were
the misfit man



always liable to flash badges pull guns
wave bits of blue paper signed by
judges and otherwise act as though
hades city were amenable to the same
laws as other places whereas having
been brought to its present state of pros-
perity by the henderson mining cor-
poration hades city could obviously be
expected to obey only such regulations
as the henderson corporation might
promulgate or approve

  the laws of the united states for
instance frowned upon such proceed-
ings as were engaging the attention of
the city on this torrid thursday after-
noon wihereas the henderson corpora-
tion not only approved but ordered
them

  con meyer seated at the head of a
long table in the heres how tea room
temporarily converted into a sort of
campaign headquarters was dividing his
attention between a dust-stained ruffian
who had just swaggered in from the
street and a code wire which had been
handed in on lower broadway

  did you see williams he snapped
knitting his brows over the combina-
tion hgob what did he say

  the newcomer shifted his holsters so
that their tied ends would not dig in
his knees and seated himself

  it wasnt so much what he said he
answered as what he did  went up
to him as gentle as a lamb meyer and
politely told him what you told me to
said wed give him twenty-four hours
more and then blow the whole bunch
of tfhem off the face of the earth well
meyer he was walking up and down
that barricade hes run up nursin that
sawn-off shotgun of hisn and when i
said that he turned to all them tame min-
ers hes got corraled and asked them
if they were goin to sit still and stand
for that

  meyer looked up from his telegram

  what did they do he asked
sharply

  they sort of kind of growled

meyer the ruffian responded in a
manner which i personally didnt like
if it hadnt bin for that rawboned guy
you smuggled in with em-that stool-
pigeon feller-gettin up an stayin they
was bound to be true to the cause of
american labor i believe theyd have
went over to williams side right then
what happened after that

  why said the messenger wil-
liams turned to me an the two guys that
went with me and asked us to show
our union cards

  well

  well that red-headed guy you sent
with me give a yell af ill show you my
union card you ld blankety blank an
pulled a gun an of course williams
plugged him in the legs with the shot-
gun an then covered me an the other
feller an told us to git out which we
done as we went we could hear him
givin an oration to the bunch about did
they want to tlhrow in their lot with a
lot of offscourings like us an all that
way they groaned he seemed to be kind
of impressin em

  meyer shot out a forefinger at a gaunt
blackguard decorating the other end of
the long table

  see what youve done schwartz
he snarled thats gettin drunk if
youd bin on deck wed have had all
those guys out of the mine an down
here in town before williams could find
out what happened as it is theyre on
strike an yet tiheyre still right there at
the mine

 they aint workin -growled
schwartz

 aint workin no they aint
workin but what kind of a fix are we
in  that old devil of a supers got em
penned inside the barricade an hes
cached all the firearms an explosives
except what he needs to keep em in
order an while he holds em buffa-
loed with a shotgun an a stick of dyna-
mite hes preachin to em a little
while more an tfheyll start in again
g

peoples story magazine

an how we goin to start anythin with
them there theyre just settin pretty
right now but we start attackin the
mine an they wont set pretty no more
itll be no use tellin em then that were
holy liberators an what not theyll
see us coinin with guns in our hands
an theyll fight back hendersons goin
to be pleased with you sdhwartz
youve been worth your railroad fare
from butte here i dont think

  well what we goin to do asked
another man

  we cant do nothin an at that
were euchred water an foodll give
out at the mine pretty soon anyway an
those guys are goin to feel chummy to-
ward us when they do aint they its
all schwartzs fault if it hadnt have
bin for him wed have had them sixty
scabs down here in the streets an have
strolled up an taken the virgin mine by
this time like henderson said we
should the idea was that wed take it
by violence in five minutes an itd take
old lockhart a year to shove us out
again by law an the ol foold have
gone broke long before then whats
liappened  why they got two carloads
of ore out and lyin on the bank ready
to be shipped an were farther away
from ownin the mine than ever i hope
that what hendersons got on you aint
serious schwartz because i bet you
when he hears about this hell throw
you to the dicks

  schwartz dark face paled

  we got the railroad tied up-they
cant get their stuff loaded into the cars
anywhere on this branch he growled
defensively

  shut up snarled meyer close
your head will ya i got to read this
telegram

  watching the leaders face which
wore at the beginning of the reading
a portentous scowl schwartz and the
other men seated at the table were re-
lieved to note a gradual lightening of
the somber expression halfway

through the code message one blunt fin-
ger on tiie telegram another between
the pages of his code book meyer
looked up and grunted almost amiably
a few words further on it actually
seemed as though he were going to
smile and at the end of the message be
suddenly emitted a roar like a delighted
bull and leaped from his chair

  by the great horn spoon he
shouted waving the telegraph form
lies coming hes coming old man
lockharts coinin west sick an that
guy martins coinin with him hes in
cahoots with lockhart some way an
hes cornin west to settle this yer strike
himself  that guy 

  slowly like a snake uncoiling
schwartz half rose

  you say peter martins coinin he
repeated

  meyer looked at his lieutenant

  oh-he punched you too didnt he
i didnt think you were here tben
my first night hes coming to set-
tle the strike is he

  meyers eyes narrowed he wanted
to hurt peter martin himself he wanted
to get him down and beat his face into
a bloody pulp with a revolver butt or a
rock but he did not want to kill him
no killing was another matter but
if he could do the beating and leave
the firing of the fatal shot or the swing-
ing of the knife to some one else that
state of affairs would be ideal

  yeah said meyer slowly hes
cornin to settle tlie strike-an to be set-
tled you know when he left here he
was kind of refined an we called him
the easterner well he got bravely
over that in new york seems he went
an held henderson up in his own office
an henderson couldnt have him pulled
because the holdup was only a fake i
guess hell carry a gun when he comes
to talk to us though

  hed better said schwartz 
carry one

  we all do meyer smiled but i
the misfit man



guess hes kind of forgotten us last
time we met he had it all his own way
we werent actin under any orders that
night get me

  the men around the long table
grinned evilly

  thinks hes the ideal western two-
gun guy does he asked one of them
cornin down to confute the dirty strik-
ers single-handed must ha bin seein
the movies

  there was a snigger in the midst
of it a shrill voice from the door cried
telegram and a barefooted boy
brought in another message to meyer

  the thick thumb ripped open the en-
velope

  he-he-he  yelled the big man its
from him sent from copper city-
railroad station hes cornin to confer
with us he-he-he  hark at this
arrivin number seventeen to confer
on strike kindly have mens leaders
available petter martin its ad-
dressed to the strike organizer thats
me all right say boys are you-all
goin to be available

  considerin that seventeens due in
twelve minutes i guess we are
growled a man who had not yet spoken
do we meet him at the station 
meyer chuckled

  i should say not let him come to
us were the leaders of the men we
are say well sit in bloomin state like
regular labor leaders shift away from
the table you guys and get the chairs in
order theres one two three-five of
you ili sit at tftie head of the table
here an three of you can sit down this
left-hand side thatll leave room at
the chairmans right for mr peter mar-
tin esquire try it out once

  amid grins from the loungers in the
room the men took their places leav-
ing unoccupied the chair at meyer s
right hand meyer himself grinned

down the board

  now listen he said  some put
the guest of honor on their right hand
bpeo

just to show him how good he is dyou
know why i do it

  suddenly he sent his vast left fist
whizzing through the space above the
empty chair

  because he explained my lefts
the arm i swing with an thats goin
to be the signal for the meetin to break
up i figure hell be surprised ill let
him get just so far in respectful silence
an then ill hit him once an when

hes down on the floor-

  schwartz drew in a long hissing
breath

  yes he said then ill speak to
him a little

  no you wont snapped meyer
you wont speak to him until i say
you can you fool you want to spoil
everything again why hes the only
thing thatll fix up your other boner
when we got him down dont you think
we can kind of prevail upon him to tell
old williams to lay aside the shotgun
an give up the fort an when hes

done that-

  deliberately the big leader polished
his broken nails on the cuff of his shirt

  after hes done that he added
meaningly why i dont care if he goes
home or stays here or what he does
so long as he dont make trouble for
us or anything

  he wont make trouble said
schwartz grimly ill answer for
that

  there was a moments silence
spose he asks what the strikes
about demanded one of the men

  why its about him employin scab
labor at the virgin mine-or old lock-
hart doin it or anyhow its bein done
said meyer tell him that

  suppose he wants to know what
union authorized it

  meyer grinned

  thatll be the time i hit him whats
the matter with you over there by the

window 	j

  seventeens cornin round the curve


peoples story magazine

  then ail you bums get outa here
shouted meyer all that aint sittin
at tiiis table-outside an lay around
the streets lookin like strikers hear me
williams aint bin able to send any tele-
grams since friday night an this fel-
ler thats coinin wont know but what
we got all the men away from the vir-
gin oufit in fact he thinks we have
an thats what lies cornin to confer
about

  oh say- began one of the men

at the window urgently

  git out shouted meyer gwan
not another word skidoo

 but-

  are you goin asked the big man
halt rising or do you want to e
helped go an look discontented-
outside

  the roam was left to the strike com-
mittee and for the five minutes elaps-
ing between the sound of number sev-
enteen stopping and the first clang of
the bell as the train resumed her way
not a word was said all at the table
were listening

  then

  say asked one of the men sud-
denly you said he was cornin with old
lockhart if lockharts sick wheres
he goin to leave him while he talks to
us may be takin him home first

  go n look outa the window an see
if hes cornin

  the man addressed shambled across
the room for a moment he stared
through the dingy panes in silence and
then he gave vent to a stifled oath

  i thought you said it was this peter
martin guy gasped the man at the
window

  well aint it

  come an look

  crowding to the side of the lookout
the conspirators stared down the one
street of hades city which led directly
from the railroad station past the
heres how to become a sand track-
on the way to the mines tt was on the

juncture of this street with the single
line of track that the eyes of the strike
committee now focused themselves tak-
ing in after a moment of stupefied
wonder a sight which caused the men
to explode into whispered oaths

  deducing the manner of peters re-
turn from the manner of his departure
those present had imagined that he
would step into hades city out of a
day coach or at the wildest estimate
out of a pullman car insead of
which there loomed on the tracks
parked square across the road with an
imperial disregard for lesser traffic the
sleek luxurious form of ft private car
cut off number seventeen and left to
be picked up by any ortier train to which
its master shuld deign to desire it at-
tached john p henderson had a pri-
vate car and by association of ideas the
sight of this private car though they
knew it to contain a man whom they
had planned to wipe off the face of the
earth gave the men at the window very
much the kind of subdued feeling wluch
afflicted them when henderson himself
was present

  what theu- muttered one of

them

  they had seen john p henderson
alight from his car several times since
hades city had been the field of his
ambitions but what was going on at
this private car was new to their expe-
rience as soon as his car was cut off
the train henderson would hurry down
the steps and bustle up the main street

  from this car surely a man was
alighting a tall man in a gray suit
wearing a gray derby hat slanted slightly
forward over one eye but he was ap-
parently in no hurry and he was not
peter martin nobody knew exactly
who or what he was though as in the
case of the private car there was some-
thing about his appearance which was
familiar to the watchers and which
gave them a certain chill it was not
until the man in the gray suit placed
the misfit man



a hand under his coat tails withdrew it
as if satisfied and then favored the
landscape with an all-inclusive survey
that schwartz spoke

   that-thats a private detective he
muttered  member that one hender-
son used to carry around with him
this guys actin just the same mem-
ber

  theres another one

   he man in the gray suit had retired
up the steps again and entered the car
a moment later he emerged accom-
panied by two other men of about his
own build dressed in clothes which re-
sembled his own only in their incon-
spicuousness yet obviously by their
quiet assured movements of his own
profession they all wore their hats
tilted very slightly forward and to one
side and as they stepped out into the
open each went through the same ex-
ploratory self-assuring motion of pat-
ting his hip a moment later a fourth
man joined them two to each side of
tlie steps of the private car these new-
comers chatted nonchalantly among
themselves fixing hades city mean-
while with careless and disparaging
eyes

  here he- began one of the com-
mittee eagerly

  but the next man to appear was not
peter martin either it was a dapper
personage in a frock coat and a top hat
who appeared to carry in his hand a
small leather satchel the appearance
of this gentleman who would have been
identifiable as a lawyer on any main
street in any large city was sufficiently
ridiculous lawyers do not usually
travel to unknown and semitropical
places in full morning kit-except at the
special request of unusually well-paying
clients and as a matter of fact this par-
ticular lawyer had spent most of his
time on the trip from new york play-
ing poker in a pair of linen trousers and
his shirt sleeves now however he
stood under the blazing desert sun in a

rig designed to impress metropolitan
juries and the strike committee faced
with the unknown trembled inwardly

  thats a judge cried one of the
men suddenly i know them frock-
coated guys the first thing they says
guilty or not guilty an the next re-
mark is ten years pm gittin outa
this

  con meyers lips were a thin line

  no you aint he said

  another man turned from the win-
dow

  say meyer he growled you bet-
ter remember that we didnt sign on to
fight no standin array i know those
guys with the bowder hats-i seen em
in action they carry automatic pis-
tols an they shoot at the drop of a hat
an if you happen to plug one of them
in return you get the chair

  meyer sneered

  they got you bluffed already have
they he asked git back to the ta-
ble the whole of you  gwan any-
body show you a ghost an youd all
pass right out i guess gwan you
yellow dogs siddown

  the committeemen sank protesting
into their seats only schwartz re-
mained unimpressed by the sight at the
depot

  listen to me said meyer you lot
of chicken-livered women this is my
business henderson give the job to
me an do you think id sublet it to
the like of you dont kid yourselves
all youre here for is to look like a strike
committee dont kid yourselves you
got any votes or anythin pm the guy
-see what i say goes an what i
dont say dont go youre dummies
an so long as you sit still you wont get
hurt so sit still you leave it to
me

  he was making in his small way the
identical mistake which from the begin-
ning of time has overthrown much
larger empires than hades city and
deposed many an emperor who would
iso

peoples story magazine

have considered con meyer too mean a
person to be accounted even a human
being forgetting that his power de-
pended entirely upon the cooperation of
the ruffians about him so used to being
a tyrant that lie failed to realize that
his tyranny rested on a basis not of
his own prowess but on the combined
valor of all those under his command
he was practically dismissing his sup-
porters and proposing to swing the
world by the tail himself had lie been
brought face to face with the cold propo-
sition of facing peter martin and the
four armed detectives alone con meyer
would have given up the job as suicidal
but he was so accustomed to having any
movement of his own list or revolver
duplicated by the fists and revolvers of
a hundred other men that he had come
to believe the effects attainable by this
combined action to be due to himself
alone

  so being himself unaffected to any
great extent by the procession which
was slowing advancing up the street he
considered all to be well he sat and
glowered at his associates with the con-
tempt of a superman

  a knock fell on the door

  it had been meyers plan to let mar-
tin wait some seconds before he gave
him permission to enter but the person
who had delivered this particular knock
was not peter martin and he did not
wait for any invitation the door
opened and the detective in the gray
suit entered followed closely by his
three associates the four men said
nothing they merely looked at those
present with a professional interest that
made uncomfortable thrills chase each
other up and down the spines of the
committee and took posts behind con
meyer and to the right of the empty
chair

  the lawyer entered behind him
came a young man-obviously a stenog-
rapher

  there appears said the lawyer

gently breaking the dead silence to be
an insufficiency of chairs doesnt
there

  one of the detectives tapjxrd
schwartz on the shoulder

  sit somewhere else my lad he ad-
vised non too in the next chair
now-

  he broke oft suddenly and sprang
into action

  infuriated and at the best of times
unstable in intellect schwartz had burst
all bounds of restraint with an ani-
mallike snarl he shook off the familiar
hand of the law on his shoulder and
with a lightning movement raised into
view the revolver he had held in his lap
there was no explosion however like
a humanized vise the hand of the de-
tective closed about his wrist twisted
it skillfully aside and with a sudden
jerk sent the gun to the floor simul-
taneously so that the clatter of the gun
and the smack of the fist blended to-
gether he hit the ruffian exactly one
inch to the right-hand side of the point
of the jaw schwartz gave a clucking
gasp and dropped

  why you- growled con meyer

in a way that made his supporters fa-
miliar with that growl to tremble in
their seats

  but the detective was not familiar
with it he was brushing an invisible
speck of dust off the lapel of his coat
without ceasing this operation he
looked calmly at meyer

  you sit down he suggested sit
down

  there was a moment of tension and
then meyer obeyed he could not have
told why he did so but for the mo-
ment everything seemed strange to him
he had been reared amid scenes of vio-
lence  he was no coward man to man
he would have declined to take orders
from jack dempsey and the champion
pistol shot of the united states rolled
into one but he was not used to dele-
gated authority he was not used to
the misfit man



the sensation of starting out to fight
one man and finding instead a man
engaged by the enemy to do the fight-
ing for him while the enemy attended
to more important matters

  in other words con meyer was buf-
faloed just as the members of the board
of the henderson corporation had been
buffaloed iti their own board room
peter martin was using to end this
strike just the reverse english on the
trick he had used to get the note ex-
tended those had been easterners
he had demoralized them by a surprise
attack in the manner of the west upon
these men accustomed to straightfor-
ward knock-down-and-drag-out nego-
tiation he was springing the unknown
terrors of eastern procedure

  the other man whom the detective
had tapped on the shoulder rose hastily
and evacuated his seat

  i dunno that i can do much good

here- he babbled  think ill

just-

  you sit down too said the quiet
detective theres a chair over in the
corner you can fetch it

  meyer half rose again

  say he snarled whos runnin
this strike anyway dyou figure you

are you-

  shut tip said the detective in the
gray suit heres mr martin

  mv-good-lord  gasped one of
the committee oh gee

  no passer-by on fifth avenue would
have found anything bizarre about pe-
ters appearance-unless like these men
the passer-by had chanced to see mr
martin in prospectors costume and just
emerging from a singularly sanguinary
fight then there would have been a
contrast over which to gasp for on
that occasion peter had worn a wide-
brimmed hat rather shabby whereas he
now wore a glistening top hat he had
been dressed down to the waist in an
old serge coat worn over a khaki shirt
stained with alkali dust in place of

which he now sported a frock coat like
the lawyers but a much better one
a white waistcoat above whose upper
edges showed two thin lines of black
a collar that would have choked any man
in hades city and a flowing four-in-
hand held together by a narrow platinum
ring

  he looked as if instead of having
traveled two thousand miles through a
landscape continually growing hotter
he had just stepped out of new york
city where nobody totes a gun and the
police are just around every corner
neither his collar nor the gardenia in
his buttonhole was wilted in the slight-
est degree which was not surprising
since the gardenia had been in water
until ten minutes before and the collar
had spent all its time in a collar box
wlile its present wearer had played
poker with the lawyer in his shirt
sleeves

  there was further to be noticed the
astounding whiteness of his hands and
the knifelike crease down his light-gray
striped trousers also his beautifully pol-
ished and pointed shoes and his silk
socks but what paralyzed the commit-
tee was something quite different as
he paused in the doorway and looked
at them this man who had left hades
city only a few weeks before as a rug-
ged roughneck felt in a vest pocket
raised his hand to his face and stared
fixedly at the strike committee through
a monocle

  for one instant it was a toss-up
whether the ruffians at the table should
shiver or laugh but at the end of that
instant they shivered quite abandon-
ing the pose of easy scorn which had
marked his entrance peter martin
crossed to the table seated himself in
the chair left vacant for him and sent
a lightning glance around the table

  are all officers of this strike pres-
ent he demanded in a voice of steel

  nobody spoke on the floor
schwartz to whose prostrate form


peoples story magazine

peter had not vouchsafed a glance
groaned and scratched

  i assume that you are said the cold
voice of this terrifying changeling from
the east well ive only a few words
to say to you this strike will cease and
determine to-day two cars will he
loaded with ore and shipped to copper
city before three oclock to-morrow

  he paused

  con meyer almost inarticulate with
fury put out a shaking hand and laid it
on the immaculate cuff of the frock

coat

  so you say mr peter martin he
whispered hoarsely hut you got to re-
member that were the people that do
the talkin around here were the boys
that say whether the strike shall go on
or not were the guys that have the
power behind us his voice suddenly
returned to him a bull-like yell an
you come here talkin and tryin to
bluff us with your-

  again he heaved himself out of his
seat and towered over the sitting dandy
to his right his fists were raised in the
air

  you come here- he roared

  with a renewal of that chill of fear
about their usually hardened hearts the
other men abaut the board noticed that
peter martin a scant eighteen inches
away frm con meyers most devastat-
ing rage did not move nay did
not even look up the only person that
moved was the detective in the gray
suit he stepped behind con meyer
and pressed something cold and hard
into the back of the big mans neck

  sit down ordered the detective un-
emotionally

  peter martin apparently quite oblivi-
ous of his surroundings was bending
across to the lawyer consulting over a
document as con meyer sank back
into his chair the rage that was his
stock-in-trade checked upon him like
a perspiration in a cold blast of wind

peter took the pajer read it through
nodded and handed it back

  for perhaps thirty seconds there was
not a sound in the room save for the
stertorous breathing of meyer as face
flushed and eyes popping he glared in
turn at each of his sujprters not
one of them would meet his eye they
were not afraid of him they were not
interested in him they knew his vio-
lent rages and the weight of his fist of
old-nay more they had just seen both
i g and fist stopped in mid-career
what puzzled them what commanded
their fearful attention was this other
man-this peculiar guy from the east
they did not know what he was liable
to do next they wanted to find out
so ignoring their fuming leader they
stared at peter martin who on his side
ignored them entirely

  in fact as if wearied by his long trip
he now covered his eyes with his hands

  all right mr parvey he said will
you speak to them 

  the lawyer adjusted his nose glasses
coughed glanced at the document in his
hands inquired by a lift of the eye-
brows if the stenographer at his side was
ready and then looked with a judicial
mildness around the strikers they
shrank from him they had met that
mildly judicial gaze or one very like it
before most of them and as the man at
the window had said the experience had
meant an extensive loss of liberty they
had considered however that judges
were few and far between and that a
real he-mans chances of being brought
before one by any practicable number
of peace officers was small but here
they were up against a jasper that car-
ried a judge around with hiijj

  i should like you all to understand
said this terrifying person gently that
we arc not offering you immunity from
prosecution in other words i cannot
promise that if you will do what my
client wishes you to do we will not send
you all to jail to make such a promise
the misfit man



would be to compound a felony under
section nine of the criminal code of
eighteen-ninety-eight hem how-
ever

 however however what the
criminal code of  prison

  i aint done nothin mister said
the man who had earlier pleaded an ap-
pointment elsewhere and who only an
hour previously had been loud in claim-
ing for himself the honor of dancing
on peter martins chest

  hm no doubt you think so said
the lawyer smiling but you are in er-
ror quite in error my client is so
far unable to advise me whether or not
you have committed any acts of violence
in pursuance of your felonious object
namely the fomenting of a strike or
civil disturbance as defined in subsec-
tion fourteen of section twenty-four of
the criminal code let us suppose you
have not in that case you are merely
guilty of conspiracy in the manner and
for the objects aforesaid and liable sev-
erally and each and all of you to fines
of five thousand dollars or imprison-
ment at hard labor for not more than
ten years or both

  my god gasped the man who had
pleaded innocence

  con meyer chuckled

  i suppose every strike gets its lead-
ers sent to jail he snarled huh
tryin to bluff us are you

  there are special precedents cover-
ing nominal conspiracy by union lead-
ers said the lawyer gently are you
union leaders

  meyer hesitated

  yes he shouted and now what
about it

  can you prove it asked the voice
of peter martin sleepily

  the men about the table held their
breath this was the moment at which
con meyer had promised to knock peter
backward out of his chair and stretch
him senseless on the ground to be
picked up at leisure and bent to the

committees will he remembered the
promise quite as clearly as did his sup-
porters and his great fist clenched he
looked first at peter martin sitting
there within easy reach of a blow and
then over his shoulder at the waiting de-
tectives the right hand of the man in
gray was now in his jacket pocket like
the right hands of the other three de-
tectives and his eyes were fixed on
meyers face

  with a grunt the big man relaxed his
muscles with a hissing of released
breath his supporters let out their for-
mer opinion of him

  suppose i cant meyer asked

  in that case and as i should be able
to prove to the satisfaction of any court
you have been conspiring as private citi-
zens to use illegal means in restraint
of trade the penalty for which as i said
is a fine of five thousand dollars or im-
prisonment for ten years or both if
however you have so much as broken
the skin on the little finger of one of
the agents of the owners of the virgin
mine you are liable to imprisonment for
fifteen years at hard labor without the
option of a fine

  mister- began one of the men

pitifully

  silence roared con meyer thun-
dering on the table with his fist

  for an instant between the devil of
his leaders wrath and the deep sea of
legal punishment the man hesitated
according to a rule much older than
shakespeare he decided to brave the
peril that he knew rather than fly to
others that he wotted not of

  mister he cried dont lump us
with him  im telling you hes the guy
that doped it all out hes the guy in
charge were just here to give you
the idea that this is a regular strike
it aint were just dummies-he was
sayin so before you come

  suddenly he broke off with a gurgle

  dont let that lad over there write
down everything i say 
is

peoples story magazine

  the stenographer calmly turned over
a page and wrote down the exact word
of this plea too the speaker panicked
he looked at peter martin peters
eves were still covered he stared at
the lawyer who returned the gaze with
a mild interest and an encouraging
smile there was no help anywhere
there was nobody to kill or beat up-
there was nothing to be done but kick in
and beg for mercy

  aided by ejaculations from his fel-
low dummies ignoring entirely in his
dread of the unseen tentacles of the
criminal law the more immediate
threats and bellowings of meyer the
terrified man stammered out all he
knew

  we aint done any damage at the
virgin mine he said mr williams
and all the guys that were workin up
there are right there still we heard
theyd struck main-lode ore-an we got
orders from new york-at least meyer
did-to go and take possession of the
mine-

  twenty years murmured the law-
yer section one hundred and nine-
teen subsection four go on

  but we didnt take it cried the
confessor old williams had got hep
somehow and hed closed up the barri-
cades around the mine and hidden all
the mens firearms durin the night and
was all ready to shoot us while we
didnt dare do nothin on account of
maybe hittin some of the workmen hed
got in there an turnin them against us
meyer stopped them workin but
theres two carloads of stuff all out and
ready an we aint done any damage
honest to god we aint

  you have also interfered with the
operation of the railroads to wit the
-iding connecting the virgin mine
with--

  before the lawyer could proceed to
detail just what section this action had
violated and propound the number of
years at hard labor which the terrible

eastern law awarded therefor another
man arose he was not in the grip of
a panic such as had afflicted the previ-
ous speaker but there was visible in his
eyes as he gazed at the mild little man
who seemed to secrete about him such
terrible things a deep and abiding re-
spect

  i can fix that all right he said t
didn t want the line monkeyed with
though meyer wanted to dynamite it

  you lie snarled meyer

  the cloth of the detectives coat
pocket touched him gently in the spine
there was something hard and threat-
ening under the gray tweed

  if mr martinll-forget all this
said the railroad man i guess there
wont be any delay gettin his shipments
through

  is that satisfactory asked the law-
yer respectfully

  peter did not raise his face from his
hands

  oh yes he murmured thats
all right meyer will furthermore
leave town to-night and will not re-
turn

  disregarding entirely the admonitory
pistol muzzle in his back conscious only
that some unknown force had stripped
him of his power as tyrant of hade-
city and was now ahont to send him
into exile meyer rose at last the
fury which had kept hades city in ter-
ror of him for months blazed forth
transporting the man beyond thought of
revolvers private detectives and jails

  well see about that he screamed
the veins in his brutal face suddenly
showing purple against a livid white
well soon see about that you gas
about your prison sentences-who s
goin to impose themj goin to arrest
a whole city an try it say you ye
bluffed these poor goofs here ringin in
all this eastern stuff on em but you
aint bluffed me an you aint goin to
bluff anybody else im goin into the
street an see what the bunch thinks
the misfit man

about it you wont buffalo them
theyll tear you to pieces

  at a bound he had gained the door
flung it open and stepped into the blaze
of sunlight which illumined thedusty
road the fire of his fury came too
late to heat those of his followers on
whom fear of the law had laid its icy
hand but the whole population of
hades city alarmed threatening sul-
len clustered outside they had not
shared in the moral effect of that inter-
view in the heres how they did not
feel as the men at the table felt that
no physical violence could avail against
the invisible power wielded by these un-
known quantities from the east the
men in the street had the perfectly cor-
rect idea that if they killed peter mar-
tin and his party it would be a long
long time before the distant courts em-
barrassed by a total lack of evidence
and by hendersons wealth would be
able to do anything

  boys- shouted con meyer

  one spark in the powder barrel now
and not one of peter martins entourage
would leave town alive if con meyer
spoke or if a bullet cut short his utter-
ance the powder would flare

  one of the detectives drew his pistol

  with a lightning movement peter
martin knocked it out of his hand
with two long noiseless strides he
gained the doorway and in full sight
of every one in the street laid a mani-
cured hand roughly on meyers shoul-
der then as meyer checked his utter-
ance and spun on his heel peter swung
the other fist upward to the jaw it
was a perfect uppercut timed exactly
placed to the fraction of an inch and
backed by martins whole hundred and
seventy pounds of bone and muscle
con meyer threw up his arms sprawled
in the dust of the roadway rolled over
three times from the force of that ter-
rible blow and then lay still

  you men inside there called peter
his eyes on the crowd in the street

  the other members of the strike
board filed out

  you can now join your friends
said peter gravely and i shall be
obliged if you will give them a full true
and particular account of the mess into
which your fallen leader there nearly
led you

  we wall said the man who worked
on the railroad grimly an-say-
that was some knock-out glad-glad
you aint entirely eastern mind
shakin hands

  peter shook hands with him then se-
rially with the other four men

  if henderson doesnt like what
youve done he said loudly enough for
the crowd to hear therell be a lot of
jobs at the virgin mine soon were
going to extend operations were on
the main lode and the payll be good
tell the boys that too

  five minutes later when peter
started out with the lawyer the stenog-
rapher and the detectives to walk to
colonel lockharts house that same
crowd gave him a straggling cheer
they were rough men they did not
know exactly what had happened but
they could understand that this mysteri-
ous jasper in the high hat had won out
against impossible odds and being
westerners they gave him credit for
it friend or foe

  one thing that puzzles me said the
lawyer as he and his client turned in at
the ramshackle gate of the colonels
house is why you covered your face
with your hands back there it im-
pressed the men with your contempt for

their violence but-

  im glad it did said peter gravely
however i hadnt figured on doing
it that way the fact of the matter is
-i couldnt make that durned piece of
glass stay in my eye and i was scared
that if i dropped it out theyd figure i
never wore one before and smoke the
whole game

chapter vii

  well we won out

  colonel lockhart received the tid-
ings half sitting propped by numerous
pillows in a vast colonial bed with pine-
apples on the tops of its posts it was
rather surprising to find such a piece of
furniture in the ramshackle frame house
of the owner of the virgin mine but
far more surprising to peter as he
stood in the doorway after firing off the
glad news was the expression of the
beds occupant

  when the private car had pulled out
of grand central colonel lockhart had
been a very sick man there had been
a doubt in peters mind as to whether
he would survive the long journey far
from raising his temperature or ex-
hausting him however the trip ap-
peared to have brightened his aged eyes
and given a strangely fighting-cocklike
twirl to his gray mustaclie whereas
the news of peters victory over the
strikers which the young man had con-
sidered would have a marvelously tonic
effect seemed instead to afflict the vet-
eran with a certain disgust

  the eyes of the senior partner in the
virgin mine fixed the resplendent jun-
ior partner coldly

  we won out did we well suh i
am glad to heah it but what i should
wish to ask of you is-

  t ctei took a rapid strike forward to

the bedside

   ou want to know how of course
well it was perfectly simple i told
you iim the train how we got away with
the extension of that note from hen-
derson i was a sort of misfit in the
fast  hen i tried to be an f-asterner
so  suddenly turned around and played
westerner there well when this strike
business came along and threatened to
tie us up so that we couldnt take up
the extended note either-why i
thought id work the reverse english on
the same trick i wasnt enough of a
westerner to buck all these jaspers at
their own game but i was a better east-
erner than the whole lot of them put
together so when matthew came and
told me that you had fifteen hundred
dollars and wanted to go home why
colonel i took a flier i hired the pri-
vate car and then i spent every last re-
maining cent and a considerable lot of
money i havent got yet fixing myself
all up like a white-waistcoated pluto-
crat i had four detectives and a law-
yer and a stenographer and a top hat
and everything all complete you know
yourself i could have landed here with
five hundred gunmen and have accom-
plished nothing-the strikers were all
set for rough stuff thats their spe-
cialty but when the lawyer started
reading them- a lot of stuff about chap
four and section nine they didnt
pause to wonder who was going to ar-
rest them or anything like that hen-
derson had never had a gun pulled on
him before and these guys had never
before had a law read to them they
just naturally panicked

  very smart said the colonel but

what i should like to ask-

  theyve agreed to load the cars with
ore and let them out added peter
leaning back in bis chair and folding
his arms and that will enable us to
raise the loan from that friend of yours
and with that we can pay off hender-
the misfit man



son s note and by that time my money
will be in our midst our worries arc
over colonel

  the colonel drew a deep breath

  i am greatly obliged to you suh he
said but-may i ask if you are now
quite done with your remarks concern-
ing the mine because i should like

to ask-

  sure said peter thats all
then i should like to inquire suh
for the third or fouth time suh said
the colonel in a voice trembling with
indignation just what you have been
doin suh to my favorite niece

  peters jaw dropped

  why- he began

  though in poah health on our trip
here said the colonel i was not too
sick suh to notice that during the whole
journey you spoke to her no moah than
was absolutely necessary finally i
asked her suh the cause of this and
she informed me that you finding that
she and not henderson held my note
had accused her of treachery to me
mr martin suh i am surprised at
you

 well-

  i am to blame i admit instead of
fightin to the last ditch and holdin off
surrender on that note to the last min-
ute as a lockhart should have done i
permitted sickness suh and old age to
make me travel to new york with the
idea of a premature throwin up of the
sponge this prevented my niece from
informin me of what she had done
not in any case that it would have done
any good the scoundrel henderson
havin tricked huh into givin him all
powers of foreclosure or extension
this is beside the point however what
i hold against you suh is that you actu-
ally suspected my niece of treachery
when as she infomed me with tears in
her eyes she was just tryin to save me
by holdin the note and thus making
sure it would be extended

  peter stared at the colonel stricken

  moreover went on the relentless
old man you appeah to me suh to
take considerble credit for this play-
actin expedition to hades city i ad-
mit that you execution was masterly
but who do you imagine provided the
fifteen hundred dollars cash money that
brought us out heah

  peter half rose

  i thought it was you

  my total assets said the colonel
gravely amounted to ratheh less than
sixty dollars after my hotel bill was
paid

  it was on the tip of the old gentle-
mans tongue to add something else
but looking at peter as he stood there
his face almost as pale as the now
slightly wilted high collar he refrained
after a moment in fact the old gen-
tleman coughed and seemed inclined to
smile catching the smile just as it
was about to slip from under the cor-
ners of his mustache however he seized
it with his teeth and bit it to death

  very sad condition of affaihs suh
he remarked in a muffled voice

  peter examined the interior of his top
hat

  i should like-er-if possible he
said to-er-see miss way and-er-
apologize-er-before i go away i-
er-i think -er-

   he looked tip to find the colonels eyes
fixed on him with an expression quite
different from that which they had held
only a few seconds before

  permit me said the old gentleman
twinkling to call you a young fool

  he extended a withered finger in the
direction of a door leading from the
bedroom

  shes in there he added in a con-
spiratorial whisper

  after peter had entered the room
closing the door behind him with the
soft carefulness of a man entering a
dentists office the former commandant
of the seventeenth kentucky zouaves
lay perfectly still on his pillows with
 s

his eyes dosed a doctor observing
that lie was smiling slightly and that he
scarcely breathed at all might have
thought he was in articulo mortis
whereas in point of fact he was merely
breaking the tradition of seventy-odd
years and playing eavesdropper

  matthew entering the bedroom with
a bottle of medicine was as alarmed as
the doctor might have been

   whats matter cunnel he cried
   the colonel opened one eye

  i am endeavoring to overhear mat-
thew he said coldly what is being
said beyond that door after all the
effort i have made i think they might
speak in higher tones anyhow i wont
have you interruptin get out
matthew rolled his eyes

   ain goin till igif you dis medstm
cunnel

  then sit down and shut up

  there was dead silence in the bed-
room from the other side of the door
came the apologetic rumble of a male
voice it ceased there was no an-
swering sound of the voice of virginia

  the colonels smile chilled and he
wagged his head protestingly on the
pillow

  peters voice rose almost into audi-
bility	

  -doing my best-treachery ev-
erywhere-hurt me to think it more
than it did you-suppose you hate me
-never see you again-anyhow-i love
you

  there was a long pause then vir-
ginias voice came to the colonels ears
it seemed to be advising peter martin
to take his departure there was an-
other long silence unbroken by the
sound of peters footsteps approaching
the door

  in the south where i come from
said virginias voice with a strange in-

  poplbs story magazine

decision in it gentlemen leave at once
when a lady requests them

   another silence

   mv successes so far said peter
 have seemed to come when i did ex-
 actly the opposite of what was custom-
 ary m the section of the country where

 i	was

  another silence matthew examined
 an enormous silver watch

   five minutes late for medsun now 
 he grumbled git on wif it boy
 do you want me asked the colonel
 in a low savage tone to get out of
 this bed and break your old black neck
 then shut up

   he lay back closed his eyes again
 and listened

 since in the south gentlemen go
 away when requested said the voice
 of peter beyond the door suppose i
 were to act as if i came from maine
 there was  answer

   suddenly the colonel sat bolt upright
 in bed

  matthew he demanded did you
 hear that 

   the old darky reaching for the medi-
 cine spoon nodded his head

   what asked the colonel should
 you say it was if you were asked
 matthew poured out a targe and vi-
 cious dose

   i should say cunnel he remarked
 balancing the spoon for its downward
 travel that it sounded mighty like a

 kiss now open you mouth-

   the colonel lay back on his pillows
 and looked upward at the nauseous draft
 above him without apprehension in
 fact he was smiling more cheerfully
 than ever

   thats just what it was matthew
 he said and-listen theres two
 more
tu get

almost all of the discussions
which have been carried  in
this department have been by
and between the readers of the maga-
zine without exception they have been
interesting and instructive-to the ed-
itors any way and we hope and be-
lieve to the readers also

  a while ago we had a communication
from one of our authors mr freder-
ick c davis in which he freely ex-
pressed his opinions on the subject of
literature his letter was stimulat-
ing especially to mr h keith trask
who has contributed and is still con-
tributing to peoples some of the best
railroad stories that we have ever read

  the whole of mr trasks letter is
enlightening we would like to use all
of the three pages in this department in
talking about it but of course we
cannot do that and we will have to
confine ourselves to expressing our ap-
probation of his reference to textbooks
which of course embraces all instruc-
tion in short-story writing personally
we have no confidence at all in such
pretended instruction chiefly because al-
most all of it wholly ignores what is
probably the first and last essential of
the art so far as we are informed
so-called teaching of short-story writing
is confined to discussions of tech-
nique but of what use is tech-
nique unless there is some substance
which may be molded by it training

of the pupils faculty of observation
would be of service to him something
to stimulate a flow of ideas would help
him immensely but where can you
find anything of the sort either in col-
leges or in other courses in short-story
writing 

  the test of a teachers value as a
teacher is as mr trask suggests his
ability to do what he professes to teach
others to do is any further comment
necessary 

  here is mr trasks letter see what
you think of it

              east sixty-eighth street
new york october  
my dear mr sessions i rise to a point
of interrogation inspired by the letter of
frederick c davis in the october th ses-
sion of the lets get together club he
writes

  the fact is it simply does not pay to
write good literature exclusively

  as a colaborer in the vineyard with brother
davis very possibly using the same make of
typewriter and an equally battered kitchen
table i feel privileged to query-does it pay
to write anything else

  upon his own statements i should say
that it does not to my mind the ques-
tion hinges upon what constitutes good
literature in the sense in which he means it
the magazine sense a wide field for dis-
putation lies before us but we can reduce
the acreage by admitting that good  litera-
ture in the magazine sense does not neces-
sarily imply material classing with milton
de maupassant or henry james mrs
wharton or that often mystifying and always
narrow compilation or twenty tales annually


peoples story magazine

pronounced the best of the year by our
self-constituted supreme court of short
stories brother obrien of boston-his
little book

  for further simplification well admit that
a wholly new plot is rarer than good red
liquor on an american-owned transatlantic
liner and just about as valuable every-
day workers like brother davis -and myself
must fall back upou the-thirty-seven was
it -basic plots and infinity wherewith to mul-
tiply their variations roughly speaking we
have one hundred and ten million people in
these united stales and each one of them
is good for at least one story as the chief
character that is if each were capable of
the production of at least one story heaven
help you-and us who are doing the piece-
work there is also an infinite variety of
local color atmosphere wherewith to frame
the pictures

  the text keeks tell us a good deal more
is required technically speaking but the
lads who write the books dont seem to ap-
pear conspicuously in any magazine table of
contents it is difficult to judge how much
of their own physic these wise doctors would
swallow

  given an riginal variation of one of the
baic plots-which necessarily implies the
power of creative imagination-an environ-
ment with which the writer is sufficiently
familiar to fashion a convincing frame a
chief character whom readers will love like
a brother or hate like the devil and lastly
but by no means leastly a journeyman com-
mand of the everyday language of our coun-
try-which is by no means english if you
are familiar with the tongue of our british
cousins-and our pieceworker is ready to
start the days job that is to say he is sup-
plied with material and tools to produce good
magazine literature and that i think has
become a highly specialized bench job un-
doubtedly brother davis will agree

  will he produce it if he is feelin blue
will he produce it if he doesnt believe that
to get over it must be the best there is
in him at a time when it is fun and not
drudgery to puuch his old machine will
be produce it when he thinks that he must
get this one in the last mail saturday so
that the check will show up in the first mail
the following saturday will he get a check
at all if he argues that maybe this one isnt
as good as the one sessions had something
nice to say about in lets talk it over
but it ought to get by

  he will not

  last winter i thought that i needed the
money a little wofse than usual t wrote

seven stories in one day over five weeks
basically i had to hand all the ingredient
i have enumerated above none of those
stones was less than si thousand words in
length several of them quite a little mure
i might better have written one which would
go over rhey all came back you yourself
told me why several of then made the round
trip your reasons were sound and illuminat-
ing but they missed the vital defect one
lacked definition of plot one-but what
the use of post-mortems

  ou said a mouthful but you missed the
milk in the coconut-or perhaps it was tact
the boob who wrote them wasnt trying to
produce good literature he was after
checks

  in the old days down on the seaboard air
line whenever they received a new loco-
motive from the builders the first thing
they did was to hang the government boiler
inspection certificate in the cab the sec-
ond was to stick up a sign in big black let-
ters where the engincman had to see it un-
less he were asleep it read

safety before speed

  when i sit down before my trusty tune
box i try mentally at least to keep before
me a sign of my own which would read
something like this

good stuff goes over-good
enough doesnt 

  if i cant if im feelin blue as davis
puts it i go out and spend some money
instead of trying to earn any i find it pays
better when the income-tax return has to
go in

  before i yield the floor lets settle this
word literature as davis and i use it
it doesnt mean anything highbrow its a
poor word anyway almost as bad as jour-
nalist newspapermen say that animal
changes his shirt only once in two weeks
while they wear two a week ive never tried
writing literature good or bad  have
tried and still am trying to think up tale
which will not only please our board of
directors the reading public but will leave
me with a satisfied sense of having given
the best i had that is the only kind of
work it pays to do this has been better
said before but its so it is also good
work in the magazine sense but it isn
literature	 

  am i right brother davis eh  little
louder please-

  sure i am

  i thank von mr chairman

  in the last issue we printed a letter
which contained some trenchant criti-
cism of the views which mr john ed-
ward barnett had expressed in a previ-
ous issue of this department we came
in for part of this criticism as you may
remember

  of course mr harnett had not seen
this letter when he wrote to us on oc-
tober th as appears below he is
writing now to emphasize what he said
before and to show that his opinions are
shared by others

  we wonder what he will have to say
when he reads mr boyds letter in the
issue of peoples for november th

  my dear sir several weeks ago you
were kind enough to give space to a letter
i penned penned is right my typewriter
complained so much i gave it away-to a re-
pairman to your most honored self that
letter sure as our colored friends say
fetched the res-ults scores of letters in
fact nigh on to a truck load have arrived
at p o box  from every corner of
u s a not to forget the island of yap
each letter in pictured phraseology tells
me how interestingly you write and how
correct you were on facts in fiction

  one letter in particular from miss ce-
cilia greig  west fifth street fort
worth texas puts into colorful language
the very things i in my wretched letter to
you forgot to mention miss greig says
i am from the north and if i pick up a
story supposedly written about and around
that country and the author made some
errors in his statements of climate or con-
ditions one would of course say thats
from some one not familiar with the north
country i have read some stories of north-
west mounted police that would make the
angels weep on the other hand the writer
may give facts facts facts until the whole
plot is lost in a chaos of nothing but facts
it seems miss greig sounded the keynote
of my argument on the literality of facts in
fiction she like other writers of many of
the letters i received agreed on even pro-

portion of facts and fact and fancy to
make the story interesting appealing and
above all life as it is the universe over

  on thing i think is that the public as
a mass want and expect too much from
their fiction authors further states miss
greig the public somehow always an-
ticipate considerable from writers although
that is natural more evident however to a
newspaper man in my opinion than any one
else

  having opened an important discussion i
am more than glad to know so many people
agree with my views on fiction and fact
for once an alleged critic writer errand
loy ex-soldier and press agent appears to
ir right in opinion its nice indeed yes to
feel i shot at a one-hundred-yard target
once and the guy in the butts that flag-
waving artist did not wave a miss

  the fact of the matter is approximately
forty of your regular readers claim i write in-
teresting letters and insist i write regularly
i am i hope politely shoving the matter
along to you-you tell em the editorial
story-inform the gang-i dont have the
nerve-being in all modesty a poor toiler in
the fourth estate and the editor frequent-
ly says bamev why in the name of over-
worked goss presses dont you learn to write
interesting copy once in your editorial ca-
reer i can add this  still cling fast
and retain my fob broken typewriter every-
thing	sincerely

  dear str  have been intending for some
time to write and tell you how much i en-
joyed your mystery story find the clock
by harry stephen keeler it kept me guess-
ing up to the last minute and i do wish you
would have another story by mr keeler
soon

  t read your magazine regularly and con-
sider find the clock your best story for
-so far-unless you have another one
as good by the same man the suspense
element in the story was a wonder after one
has been fed up on these quite unmysteri-
ous mystery stories that lots of the maga-
zines now publish yours truly

 the misfit man

                     he made

               a re you a
square peg
in a round hole
or a round peg
in a square hole
or are you one
of the fortunate
ones who is sat-
isfied and happy in his work and his
environment do you love your job
do you get pleasure and enjoyment in
your life outside of your working
hours

  theres no telling of course how
many people there are in the world
who are doing things for which they
have no talent a pessimist would as-
sure you that such people are in an
overwhelming majority that those who
are really fitted to their work are so
few as to be practically negligible an
optimist will carry you to the other
extreme

  but speculations like this are of no
value especially certainly not to the in-
dividual who is dissatisfied and the
misfit man is about as unhappy a speci-
men of humanity as can he found he
can never be really happy while his
condition is unchanged

  the real question is not how many
such people there arc in the world but
what such people do to alter their cir-
cumstances it would pay somebody
to find that out for then a more or
less simple rule might be discovered
which would show others the way

  in the story in this issue under this
title the man in the case coming to
the east out of the west found that

no

progress in
h i s business
so long as he
followed
eastern man-

	e r s and
methods so
the bright idea came to him to pose as
a western man in the east and an east-
ern man in the west

  now we do not presume to say that
this mans idea may be crystallized into
a universal rule for the relief of round
pegs in square holes but there really is
something in it which is of practical
value

  after all the curse of a misfit man
is that he finds himself in a rut-a vic-
tim of routine change is his only sal-
vation  and change may be had by
means of a new point of view by in-
ventiveness by initiation by scheming
to do the old duties in a new way by
being a western man in the east and
an eastern man in the west by sur-
prising himself and his associates by the
novelties of his methods

  there may be something in this try
it out anyway-it cant hurt you

fort most people begin to lose weight right

natural law that any one can follow with ease

three pounds per week and by the middle of may i
weighed just what i wanted to- pounds only

main thin special-
ists realized that

gene christian the
worlds foremost food
specialist began his
remarkable experi-
ments he discov-
ered that certain
foods when eaten
together take off
weight instead of
adding to it  cer-
tain food combina-
tions cause fat 
others consume fat
if you eat certain
kinds of foods to-
gether at the same
meal they are con-
verted into fat in
the body but if
you eat these very
same two foods at
different times they
are converted into
blood and muscle
and the fat you al-
ready have is used
up in energv
